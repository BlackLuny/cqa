1tYw97CRaa	my mom had the same thing done a month or so ago, she is 40. nothing life threatening, don't worry. she had to stay in the hospital for 3 days after the surgery, because they wanted to keep an eye on her. she was really sore for a week or so, but the pain killers helped a lot. she couldn't drive for about a month. after about 4 weeks she could get around just fine, but she exhausted quickly. she was able to go back to work around this same time.  <br>  <br>  i think the age factor will effect the healing time. when you get older, your body just isn't as efficient as a younger person's.  <br>  <br>  but i still think ther is nothing to worry about.  the doctor's will not send her away until she is ready. she will be taken care of.|`|yjNRhUXGaa	All operations can be dangerous and many many women get this every year and my auntie had this also not long ago and she is in her 40's, and she is very well and recovered for the better.<br>  <br>  She needed a lot of help and rest at first. <br>  <br>  There is always a chance of some thing going wrong and my auntie did have complications and had to go into surgery again. But they took good care of her, most of the percentage of women who under go a Hysterectomy are of an older age.<br>  <br>  I will tell you that you are best to talk to a doctor or your mother about how you feel. So they can give you real medical information on the surgery! <br>  <br>  But i think the best you can do, is it take good care of your mum and help out!
401ab1f5f1057ecd9a08d04d361fdf8baa	It can happen believe me I know how strange things can happen..Friday I was in my orthopedic doctor's office and have a detached muscle from the bone almost in the same area!!  Mine was from a backward fall off of a hearth, twisting type fall.  Happened so fast actually don't know just "how" it could have done that but it did.<br>  You need to check with your orthopedic doctor, or regular one and ask about muscle relaxants, and since you are having new changes in the area talk to them and have them explain what can happen.<br>  You will be relieved at least.  Pain from this area can hurt all in that region...hip on sitting, walking, getting up & down, etc.<br>  Good luck|`|kToZcmOgaa	a "groin strain" could more likely be tied with hernia with could restrict your movement if you lift something heavy. my brother has hernia because he was in a car accident too you just need to be careful with your movement until your tissue is particularly healed then it may be easier to move until you feel better though ask your Doctor to subscribe some type of pain killers that will numb the pain for a little while. anyways good luck i hope you feel better|`|Lgc9SGfkaa	Hiiiiiiii....This is the web about condom quality of sexual relations and some talk about breast cancer in women.

Q4ggnG0waa	Dry air from winter and dry heat from heating your house in the winter causes the exact symptoms you have.|`|nEuKwzcqaa	you really need to speak to your gp as there isn't enough info, for example how long have you had cough? is there cancer in your family? have you changed anything in your environment lately which could cause an allergic reaction? this is just a few of the questions and there are a lot more. naturally it would be better to stop smoking but that might not necessarily be the cause
mQg5SVQXaa	Not worth the money--it's a gimmick.  If you can eat yogurt and drink cranberry juice, that would be better for you.
401ab1f5f1057ecd9a08d04d361fdf8baa	Am going to try to answer what I think you are asking...<br>  If a person gets an outside cut on his/her head like he would on his/her arm, it is still losing some blood.  How much you would lose depends on how deep the cut, not where it is.  IF the cut was severe enough to the head from say trauma, that person would be in an ambulance if lost that much blood.<br>  A person has to eat enough of vitamins, healthy foods, and red meat, to reproduce red blood cells and bring their blood count up.  I have seen babies that only wanted to drink milk from bottles that would be chubby but their blood counts low...not getting enough of the right food to produce the red blood cells.<br>  If you, or someone you know, suffer from depression to the extent you are unable to eat, it would be good to talk with a doctor and be treated.  There are many mild antidepressants on the market today to help cope with this.  No need in going thru depression when you don't have to.  It is a illness that needs treating just as heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses.  <br>  I hope you, or the one you ask of, get the attention needed and feel better soon.

No, your teeth feel stiff for about a day but the application of the brace is completely fine<br>  3. takes about 30/40mins as they just glue metal squares to your teeth.<br>  4. You can eat anything really, they tell you not to eat gum or toffees... but i did and it didnt affect me..<br>  <br>  Make sure you use a "non-electrical" tooth brush and brush "ontop" of your braces as well as underneath (if that makes sense, they should explain that in the orthodontist)<br>  <br>  In general they wont hurt much they will just be sensitive to pressure for the morning after.|`|y5xrKPxMaa	1. there are loads of different colours just choose what you like at my orthodontist there was everything from blue to pink, purple green yellow and just about every colour inbetween! just choose one you like. <br>  2. Yes it can be for the first few weeks im afraid, you mouth will feel very tight and uncomfortable, but the good news it it wont feel so bad after a while.<br>  3. i dont quite know what you mean by this question- if you mean how long does it take to have them put on it takes about anything between 20 mins and 40 mins depending on your dentist really. if you mean how long before you have them off then it depends on how bad you teeth are and how quickly they move. I had mine on for about three and a half years, quite a long time but mine were quite bad.<br>  4. you can eat anything but i wont suggest toffee. although for the first few weeks it will hurt when you eat so you are better off sticking to things you dont have to chew and liquids, so things like soup, yoghurt, and food like that really.<br>   When you have them tightened they will hurt each time for a while unfortunately but its not as bad as when you first get them on. Also you may wan to use a soft toothbrush to begin with. They take a while to get used to but just think of the lovely teeth you wil have afterwards =) Good luck =)|`|N8kxg8wgaa	1. Just get your favourite colour, they show you all the colours you can get.<br>  2. Its not painful getting it on but it hurts afterwards when your teeth start to move.<br>  3.

YQ9YXcEkaa	Hodgkin's Disease and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are both cancers of the lymphocytes and lymphatic system.  They are therefore pretty closely related and their symptoms tend to be very similar.<br>  <br>  Some differences:<br>  <br>  Hodgkin's Disease is characterized by a certain kind of cell called a Reed-Sternberg Cell.  There are four "classical" subtypes of Hodgkin's Disease and one non-classical form (Nodular lymphocyte predominant).<br>  <br>  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, on the other hand, is a very diverse set of cancers -- basically any lymphoma that is not Hodgkin's Disease gets classified as Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Some common kinds of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma include Burkitt's, Diffuse Large B-Cell, Mantle Cell, and Follicular.  <br>  <br>  Hodgkin's tends to progress at a moderate rate.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas tend to grow at all different rates (leading to classification as aggressive or indolent).  <br>  <br>  Hodgkin's Disease is almost always considered curable.  Some kinds of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are curable and others are not.  Some of the different N-HL kinds have as high if not higher rates of cure than Hodgkin's Disease.  It really depends on what subtype you're talking about.<br>  <br>  Hodgkin's Disease tends to hit a younger population; it is most common in the 15-35 age group (there is another peak late in life).  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tends to effect people who are older, though certain subtypes (like for example Burkitts) tend to be found most often in children.<br>  <br>  There are different prognostic factors used for estimating prognosis with Hodgkin's Disease and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  <br>  <br>  Hodgkin's Disease has a tendency to begin in the chest, especially in younger patients.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can start anywhere. <br>  <br>  Hodgkin's Disease and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are treated differently.  The ABVD regimen is most commonly used for Hodgkin's Disease at least here in the US.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are treated with much more of a wide variety of chemo agents, reflecting the differences among different subtypes.  A commonly used N-HL treatment is called CHOP-R.<br>  <br>  That gives you an overview.  There's a pretty good chart here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://healthguide.howstuffworks.com/hodgkins-disease-in-depth3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://healthguide.howstuffworks.com/hod...</a><br>  <br>  That outlines some the main differences between HD and NHL.|`|CTPFrR0Paa	The difference is in the type of cancer cell (lymphocyte) involved|`|RyZXJU1Aaa	Good question with a loaded answer. Basically with Hodgkin's there are Reed-Steinberg cells present, giant neoplastic (abnormal) cells. Hodgkin's has an excellent success rate with chemo and radiation treatment.<br>  <br>  Non-Hodgkin's don't have Reed-Steinberg cells.. Also they are not nearly as responsive to chemo or radiation therapy.

If it doesn't come on time, then take a pregnancy test.  If it comes back negative, then wait for the period.  If the period doesn't come after another week, take another pregnancy test.

You have to try harder than others to MAKE it happen.|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	You'll have to excuse me im feelling a little silly but if you want to exercise out your demons my advise would be to get them to the gym and do some cardio.  Stop "feeding them" with high fat content of fear and insecurity. An "exersism" should be proformed.  Which you can do: "clean out your closet" to a person who is not bias. You might find you have also "skeltons in your closet" some with flesh still on them.  I'll give you a quote  "Get rid of the dead, they stink up the joint".

KOYC3XkJaa	Unfortunately, muscle strains, tears, and pulls can take a very long time to completely heal. <br>  When you're stretching, what kind of pain is it? Stretching should be a little uncomfortable. If it hurts badly, then your muscle hasn't fully healed or you're trying to force the stretch too far. You need to take it slow.<br>  As to not being able to get your leg straight above your waist, you haven't been stretching for a long time. You lose flexibility when you don't stretch. You need to slowly work your way back to where you used to be.<br>  If the pain you get when stretching is that of a pulled muscle vs just pushing too hard, then you should head to the doctor's and get a referral to a physical therapist.

It won't sabotage your diet.|`|pyzUlN7taa	Sometimes if you completely cut something off, it will make it harder for you to resist.  Moderation is key.  Turn your cravings into appropriately-portioned rewards.  Then you won't be driven to binge/overindulge.  Also, the key to any diet is exercise.  If you burn more than you consume, then you can pretty much eat what you want.  One could eat cheeseburgers all the time, but if they exercised enough, they could still lose weight.   By getting in better shape, you'll increase your natural metabolism and will have to do less work (and dieting) in your time outside of the gym.  A lot of times, people try to overcompensate with restricting their caloric intake too much.  But you need some fuel to burn the oven (your metabolism).  Eating breakfast is very important because it speeds up your metabolism for the rest of the day, even if it's a small portion (like a banana, bowl of cereal, half a bagel, etc.).<br>  <br>  I don't know what you crave, but there are plenty of healthy food options that are very satisfying.  Pasta is both very healthy and quite cheap.  There are plenty of foods that you can look up.  Also, force yourself to drink a lot more water than you're used to so you can filter everything out of your system.

Which I would say that would be fine; everyone has different imaginations.  I believe that this "robert" is actually your conscience telling you not to bite your tounge.  You may find that thought distrubing but that would be OCD.  Which means your compelled to do say or touch or think the quote on quote "wrong" things.  But it is hard to believe that it is normal to think of bad things or talk to yourself.  Just don't act on them and you will be fine for now.  You should tell someone and get an evaluation by a therapist.  It would be in your best interest.  You don't have to keep it a secret that would be the worst thing you could do.  I hope I helped|`|oLCPlFnXaa	Talking to yourself isn't overly abnormal, but if you are having full blown auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), you may need to seek help. Do some research.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|crHWAoaWaa	Cut that sucker out!|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|dJyR1p2faa	Yes, a good book to help with the is "The Miracle Seven" by John Peterson|`|zMu0p1wjaa	do not eat!

gorGTRRqaa	The simple answer is don't do it. But that rarely works because it's extremely difficult and we humans are so much more complex than that. So, with that said:<br>  <br>  TALK TO SOMEONE. The most hazardous thing you can do right now is to keep this to yourself. You need to tell someone who you trust, and preferably who is not struggling with the same thing. Accountability is the way to get good habits back into your life, and bad ones out.<br>  <br>  It's a shame that no-one warned you to stay away from it earlier. Porn (as well as masturbation, which is often linked in) is one of the most addictive things today. No blame or judgment intended. :-)<br>  <br>  If you don't do anything about it now, it will only get harder. The sooner you talk to someone, the better off you will be later. The first step is admitting the problem, and I'm proud that you've gotten thus far. I personally recommend specifically talking to someone in a Christian church, as they can really help. They helped me, after all. You can find a church near you by logging on to www.ag.org (US) and on the left there's a link "Search for AG church". Or log onto www.aog.org.au (AUS) and click "Find a Church". That's up to you.<br>  <br>  I also recommend asking your parents (or a friend) to buy you Every Young Man's Battle. It's an awesome book for struggling teen guys. The writer's not afraid to hold anything back. You can find it on amazon.com<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :-)<br>  -Zeke|`|xId6nfFAaa	Wanting to see girls naked is one of the most primal urges in life.

534a2bed725442955035a2a887d3d7c9aa	I worked on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise and a carrier deck in the middle of flight operations is louder than h*ll and because of that i learned that in some situations, you can use ear plugs, BUT, you just don't put them all the way into your ears! You an still hear quite well, but it does help with the volume, you can just experiment with the depth to find what will work best for you. Also, try to have the speakers aimed away from you, and also try to make sure that the sound coming from the speakers does not reflect back in your direction.|`|8D361MUKaa	Earpugs are in because they just reduce the sound not entirely block it. Even classic musicians have like a 30db hearing loss after 20 or 30 years of playing. The only other way is to lower the volume of the sound you are making and that will not go over as well, or perhaps be a long way away from the speakers but that might not be practical and will only help a little bit.

As you noticed shaving makes the cut end rough,  and that is quite painful if you are lucky enough to have sex with a girl-- painful for her that is--- like sticking her with pins, and around the very sensitive and delicate vaginal opening, may end up with the deal falling through. Also, those rough sharp hairs poking up can also poke holes in a condom and allow it to tear or rip plus of course allow semen to leak out. Not a good thing. <br>  Keep your razor away from your shaft dude and let nature take its course. Most guys I know have hair on their shafts part way up, so what.

Its not comfortable especially first 2-3 days after shaving.<br>  Its better to cut the hair using scissor every 10-15days or weekly basis depending on how quickly it grows. No need to go anywhere for this.<br>   In my case I cut the hair using scissor every 20-25 days.Mail me for more.|`|MgMsMExPaa	I also have a hairy dick. They are quite common.

You could get them removed by expensive laser surgery.

I just shave them about once every two months.|`|AA11317789	It's normal. As far as permanent removal.. I wouldn't really suggest waxing the shaft of your penis, but in the future you could look into electrolysis.

In mammals, testosterone is primarily secreted in the testes of males and the ovaries of females, although small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid.<br>  <br>  In men, testosterone plays a key role in health and well-being as well as in sexual functioning. Examples include enhanced libido, increased energy, increased production of red blood cells and protection against osteoporosis. On average, an adult human male body produces about forty to sixty times more testosterone than an adult female body, but females are, from a behavioral perspective (rather than from an anatomical or biological perspective), more sensitive to the hormone.However the overall ranges for male and female are very wide, such that the ranges actually overlap at the low end and high end respectively.There are many routes of administration for testosterone. Forms of testosterone for human administration currently available include injectable (such as testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate in oil), oral, buccal,transdermal skin patches, and transdermal creams or gels. In the pipeline are "roll on" methods and nasal sprays.The original and primary use of testosterone is for the treatment of males who have too little or no natural endogenous testosterone production—males with hypogonadism. Appropriate use for this purpose is legitimate hormone replacement therapy (testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)), which maintains serum testosterone levels in the normal range.<br>  <br>  However, over the years, as with every hormone, testosterone or other anabolic steroids has also been given for many other conditions and purposes besides replacement, with variable success but higher rates of side effects or problems. Examples include infertility, lack of libido or erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis, penile enlargement, height growth, bone marrow stimulation and reversal of anemia, and even appetite stimulation. By the late 1940s testosterone was being touted as an anti-aging wonder drug (e.g., see Paul de Kruif's The Male Hormone). Decline of testosterone production with age has led to a demand for Androgen Replacement Therapy.<br>  <br>  To take advantage of its virilizing effects, testosterone is often administered to transmen as part of the hormone replacement therapy, with a "target level" of the normal male testosterone level. Like-wise, transwomen are sometimes prescribed anti-androgens to decrease the level of testosterone in the body and allow for the effects of estrogen to develop.<br>  <br>  Testosterone patches are effective at treating low libido in post-menopausal women. Low libido may also occur as a symptom or outcome of hormonal contraceptive use. Women may also use testosterone therapies to treat or prevent loss of bone density, muscle mass and to treat certain kinds of depression and low energy state. Women on testosterone therapies may experience an increase in weight without an increase in body fat due to changes in bone and muscle density. Most undesired effects of testosterone therapy in women may be controlled by hair-reduction strategies, acne prevention, etc. There is a theoretical risk that testosterone therapy may increase the risk of breast or gynaecological cancers, and further research is needed to define any such risks more clearly.<br>  <br>  There is a myth that exogenous testosterone can more or less definitively be used for male birth control. However, the vast majority of physicians will agree that to prescribe exogenous testosterone for this purpose is inappropriate. But, perhaps more|`|ZOKEWd5Daa	<a href="http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/02/treatment-of-erectile-dysfunction.html" rel="nofollow">http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>

9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	There can be many reasons for arm pain.  These range from the very serious - cardiac problems for instance, to the very minor.  The good news is that your pain is extremely unlikely to be due to a heart problem.<br>  The pain could be due to a 'trapped nerve' and this could explain the length of time you have had this for.  It may also be due to a shoulder problem with pain radiating down the arm.<br>  It may be worth asking your GP for a referral to a physio who will be able to help you with exercises.|`|9j2k2KeZaa	give it a couple more days if not go see your gp
JpMDJndNaa	The key is how much you put into it. If you just do the moves you'll get some results but if you really put yourself into it and tighten your muscles as you do the moves you'll get far better results. If you're feeling really sore when you do the workout than stick to doing it 3 times a week, once you're body is used to it you can do it more often. Never forget 80% of your workout is what you eat, so make sure you're following a nutrition plan or your results will be minimal. <br>  As a side note, as you first develop more muscle in you core areas your fat will stick out more because of the muscle underneath. Don't let this discourage you because it's a necessary step and if you keep with the cardio and stick to a strict nutrition plan you can eventually burn the extra fat off to reveal a sexier body underneath. Good luck and congratulations on giving birth, your must so happy (but tired) right now :)

You've highlighted both an elevated and depressed episodes, both of which last long enough to be assessed as some form of Bipolar Disorder. Talk to your parents about being tested. Hypomanic episodes, by the way, can be an extremely helpful element in all aspects of your life, which you seem to have experienced Do a little bit of scrounging around the internet on the subject. I am Bipolar type 2 myself, and it is easily manageable evenn without medication.|`|KfhXz2cYaa	sounds like an average teenage girl. possibly on her period.|`|ruamFLoiaa	There are recurrent depressive states.  Multiple episodes of depression are common.  When you say that you feel great...how great?  On top of the world?  Needing little sleep?  That could be a manic state if so.  <br>  <br>  I hate to suggest that but it is a possibility.  A friend of mine went through a period where he said he felt great.  I was happy for him till I found out that he actually had undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder.   <br>  <br>  If you truly just feel normal then it is good that you are out of your depression. :)  Just be aware that mood swings can be a problem that requires some treatment.

GSmOeYguaa	coughing it out is the best way, but i discovered that if i take vitamin c before the actual onset, say the 1st day by the time the symptoms show up, and continue taking it, the phlegm lessens to the point that it's barely there. but if i take it during the middle of the onset, it doesn't help with the phlegm, but it does cut short my suffering by a couple of days. <br>  i don't know if it'll work with you, especially this late on the onset, but vitamin c will help your immune system.<br>  <br>  regarding not being able to breathe, try this:<br>  1. in a large bowl/pan (not the one you use for food, k) pour boiling water.<br>  2. on it, put some spoonful/fingerful of vapour rub (Vick's or anything with menthol &/or eucalyptus)  <br>  3. put your face over it, put a large towel over your head & the bowl. make sure your head & the bowl is covered to trap the steam.<br>  4. if you can, breathe in, if not, let it just work. <br>  5. it will also help if you rub some of those vapor rub on your chest, throat, and upper back (where your lungs are) before you do this.<br>  <br>  this helps reduce the viscosity of the phlegm, & it'll probably trickle down your nose (you did say no coughing (",)). just prepare lots of tissue.|`|1b8gW3Dfaa	If you want to get rid of phlegm, don't take a cough suppressant or use throat lozenges.<br>  Don't swallow that phlegm if you want to get rid of it.

JV0VqaqAaa	Speaking from experience....stretching is the key to doing the splits. It's not necessarily about weight...because I know fat people who can do the splits. You must stretch the muscles in your inner thighs....every single day...morning, afternoon, and at night. Don't be lazy when it comes to the stretches....stretch as much as you can.  As you keep doing it you will notice that you can stretch more and longer each day. I wish you Good Luck!

HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|HsrRNnIBaa	From a guy, you're sure not fat. You're probably really hot in a bikini. There's no need to lose weight. And because you're a dancer, a lot of that weight is muscle, not fat.|`|oiB4KATuaa	You sound like a normal healthy girl, not fat at all...usually dancers are expected to be underweight, in which case you should tell them to stick it!

I also had the strange sensations at the back of my head, almost a crawling feeling or chemicals or something. And YES it is curable, well, can be overcome I should say. It is no surprise you have the anxiety while studying, but it could be linked to some other trigger - such as past trauma , unresolved issues etc. What worked for me was getting help- finding a cognitive behavioural therapist - CBT as it is called . They help you find what your trigger is , then they help re-programme the way your body responds to it. I tried everything else first, but this was the only thing that really helped me. That and taking lorazapam daily for a few weeks at a time, what that did was re-programme the brain to release the right chemicals at the right times, instead of the stress chemicals adn adrenalin. The body gets into a pattern of releasing those chemicals and it just needs to be set back on the right track.<br>  I am 24 and suffered for a year with severe panick attacks. If you would like more info feel free to email me at tarlzc@hotmail.com.<br>  <br>  All the best

The only thing I could come up with is that it can be caused by stress and improper diet.  I would say to try to eat healthy, get plenty of rest, and try to eliminate any stress in your life.  Just generally take care of yourself!<br>  Another option is to get on birth control, like the pill, which can regulate your periods.|`|KfzuzB47aa	yeah it would show on a blood test, if your on the pill your body could just be readjusting itself, or your body could just acting abnormal. i have really weird periods so dont freak k
kTVQ4QeGaa	it's not really a disease, it's a condition...<br>  <br>  I think there is surgery to 'cure' it but for most people the option is to manage it rather than cure it. <br>  Medication can control seizures and allow you to live a completely normal life.|`|7qqJlW5maa	manageable|`|N2AKuvVkaa	I agree with manageable, but there are surgeries that can be done on the brain to remove scar tissue that could be causing the convulsions. In saying that, it is a very risky option, and it may not cure the epilepsy. My brother, who has had epilepsy since he was 2 (he's 27 now) has been through 2 brain surgeries to remove scar tissue. We thought they worked, but they didn't, and he now has little to NO short term memory. It's quite sad actually. But i guess the short answer would be POSSIBLE.

expS4Pgeaa	It depends on whether you have ringing in the ears type tinnitus or pulsatile tinnitus (where the "noise") is more like a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  Sermion is one of the better drugs available in that it doesn't have very harsh side effects, usually just itchiness, gastric upset and dizziness, it is usually used more for treatment of pulsatile tinnitus.<br>  <br>  You really should get a diagnosis from your ear nose and throat specialist to find out which type you have and they will steer you to the most suitable treatment.|`|M2XQMPNNaa	Sam, you need a consultation with an ear,nose and throat Dr. for the best recommendation based on your particular symptoms and damage. Tinnitus is a very annoying condition, but in many cases can be corrected or at the least symptoms lessened. The Dr. needs to evaluate the structure of your inner ear to offer you the best course of treatment. I hope you are able to get relief.

They don't have a serious mental condition.<br>  They just starve themselves because they are in competition with the other stars to receive the most attention and acting roles.<br>  <br>  Eating disorders aren't about that, they are not about looking thin. Often when celebrities come out about eating disorders they refer to it as feeling pressure to be perfect (an example is Portia DeRossi). She said that she wouldn't have got so skinny if it weren't for being on a tv show. I don't believe she had a real eating disorder.<br>  <br>  People with real eating disorders battle it there whole life and go into clinics to recover.<br>  <br>  Like I said, watch some documentaries about anorexia in children and adults and you will see what I mean.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Not all celebs have eating disorders. But it is very common because they're constantly having pictures of them put in magazines if they put on a meer couple of pounds, saying they look fat, when really they just look healthy.

HcS8vzNCaa	Duromine is an appetite suppressant, and falls under the pharmaceutical category called phentermines.   Duromine is manufactured by 3M and distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand.<br>  <br>  From my research, I see a prescription is needed to obtain this pharmaceutical in Australia, but I live in the United States, so you need to check the laws yourself.  <br>  <br>  I did find an online pharmacy which ships world-wide, and they have doctors on staff to issue prescriptions.  Since you already have had a prescription for it, it should not be a problem to renew it, unless you have had bad side effects.  <br>  <br>  Rather than resort to pharmaceuticals for weight suppression, my recommendation would be to follow more natural routes.  Drinking lots of water will give you that filled-up feeling on zero calories.  A second recommendation is to focus on so-called negative calorie foods, foods which take more calories to digest than they provide.  A 25 calorie piece of broccoli, for instance  takes 80 calories to digest.   I have provided a site where you can begin your research into negative calorie foods.  <br>  <br>  All my best to you.  If you must have more duromine, please be sure to follow the laws.  There are alternatives to weight loss pills, and I hope you opt for the natural route.|`|LMITI1I3aa	you need a script for it mate, don't trust the stuff you get online you'll get ripped off with different pills.

M2XQMPNNaa	Have you followed an "elimination" diet? it seems to me that you possibly have another food allergy, in addition to your lactose intolerance, the most likely culprit being wheat. I am a little confused by your story, you say the pills "worked like a charm" but that you continued to have cramps and diarrhea everyday? That doesn't sound too charming to me! Treatment here in the US for lactose intolerance is more designed around not eating dairy again! There are a myriad of alternatives to standard dairy- soy, rice or nut milks, as well as cheeses and yogurts and even ice creams made from soy or rice milk which are quite tasty! I certainly wouldn't enjoy gulping down a nice big glass of milk if I knew it was going to send me running to the toilet an hour later!! You would do well to avoid dairy entirely and add in the alternatives where you need them (as in soy milk on your cereal) and be certain to supplement with a calcium/vitamin d tablet. It would be well worth your while to explore the elimination diet as well and try and track down the source of your continued bowel trouble. Statistics show a person with one food allergy are very likely to have more than one food allergy/sensitivity. Removing wheat entirely for a minimum of 2 weeks may make an incredible difference to you. There are guidelines available online, check for gluten-free diets. Wheat ingredients are hidden in many foods and condiments you wouldn't expect. Also, it may be of great benefit for you to eliminate sugar as well. Sugar often fuels the culprits in wheat and dairy sensitivity. While it takes a good deal of effort and planning to modify your diet and it may seem a hardship to have to forgo some of your favorite foods, not having these awful symptoms will be a true victory for you and living without having to plan your life around the need to run to the toilet can be very liberating! Good luck.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Are you avoiding every product that has dairy in it? I'm just curious..Also are you sure that you don't suffer from ulcers or something like that? Constant stomach pain and diarrhea shouldn't be happening like that if you have lactose intolerance. My father suffers from that and aside from drinking Lactaid milk I've never known him to suffer from things like that. <br>  <br>  Hope all goes well with your doctor visit though!
WwTxboY9aa	Hiya, it can be caused by blocked fluid lines within the body, which is caused by a number of things including muscle tension. I have found magnesium gel excellent for clearing the blockages, reducing swelling and taking away the pain. If you are interested in finding out more about it feel free to email me at tarlzc@hotmail.com.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	If you seriously believe you have water retention problems see your doctor as "TRUE" water retention is almost always due to other issues which would need attention.<br>  <br>  Most people who complain of "water retention" are suffering nothing of the sort however, and it can range from simply over eating to minor food intolerance's.  If you fall into this category you need to deal with the real issue, fixating on "water retention" produce no results and may even damage you!
5t9stUYjaa	You're definitely not going mad.<br>  In relation to the depression, have you seen anyone professionally? If so, they would have explained to you about endorphins, and how release of these can give you a kind of natural high. Physical activity can increase production of this, which would explain the high.<br>  For the shower, although it has nothing to do with endorphins (unless it's to a painful extent) it may just be a stress alleviating technique, that's quite commonly used.<br>  And look at it this way: there are worst habits you could get into than working out and showering to relieve depression. :o)|`|tVF9O1Olaa	I do know what you mean, a few months back when i was at my worse, i wouldn't leave my bed as i couldn't face the world but just forcing myself out of bed to have shower/bath i felt so much more better!

971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	You need to get her to the vet PRONTO!  My roommate and I each had puppies that caught parvo.  It was terrible.  They were vomiting horribly (at one point, they began to vomit blood).  One of the puppies died within just a couple days.  The other I managed to save, but it took constant care on my part for two solid weeks, spoon feeding her pepto and baby food while continually giving her shots in the back of her neck with water to keep her hydrated.  It was one of the worst experiences with an animal I have ever had.<br>  Get her to the vet so he can get some medicine in her to jump start her recovery.

Don't waste time.<br>  <br>  And get the clothing and blanket OFF her.  She'll finish up having a fit.<br>  You don't heat up a hot being.<br>  Cool her down with a tepid sponge bath.

006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	I grew an extra inch after high school graduation and so did one of my children.  I've always heard that you've completely reached your height by 21.  I have several family members who are 4'll" and being petite is a very feminine thing.  I find that most extremely tall guys tend to love the petite girls.  As for the people laughing, how ignorant they truly are.  I mean, do you laugh at tall, skinny, or fat people?  Probably not.  Only losers make fun of others.  Embrace your petite frame.|`|Nd6uItCDaa	Sorry hun, it seems like you're stuck at that height.<br>  Just wear heels that's what me and my sister do.<br>  And, usually for a girl, unless they have a generally really tall family, they will grow the most for a year before and after once starting their menstual cycle.<br>  <br>  Oh and remember, the best things come in small parcels :)<br>  <br>  Another idea that may help you, is the ability to laugh at yourself. I know it sounds odd but me and my friends always do it, so we know we're all midgets, possibly related to hobbits lol. It's a really funny way of acceptance.|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  I'm sorry to hear you're feeling so bad about this, but I did a study on height so I can tell you I understand. You're not alone.<br>  The bad news is that you get your height from your parents and with their heights being a bit short I don't think you have much chance to grow more. Most girls are done growing at 16 anyway.<br>  But there is good news! Even if you can't grow more there's a lot you can do that will make you look taller and feel confident about yourself.<br>  I have spoken to a lot of people in this situation so I have a lot of useful tips and advice. If you want to talk more you can contact me through my profile.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|SzZueIfCaa	=/ Don't worry, i know how you feel, i hate being small and everyone takes the mic, I've been the same height for a year and a half now, and i'm 14, i feel like i've stopped growing too, i'm the same height as you actually, and it could be possible, i think puberty stops completely at 18. So you got a little longer, but with small parents its most likely your going to stay small =/ Its just one of those horrible parts of life. And for the self-esteem thing, I know how you feel, Maybe get counselling? It Does help, lots of people with low confidence and low self esteem get counselling and it can really help. No Stretching exercise or anything will really help you to grow unfortunately. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped and i hope you gain your Self-esteem Back.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

It can affect not only your scalp but also other areas rich in oil, such as your eyebrows. <br>  <br>  Since you have tried so many different shampoos and still are having problems, it is probably time to talk to your doctor or dermatologist.

ebb4b810f34245706f791aeb50bec63aaa	Based on personal experience it sounds like bursitis.  It's a very annoying injury because it can linger for a long time.  I had it twice on my right shoulder and the pain lasted 9 months and 6 months respectively even though I went to physical therapy 2-3 times a week.  I still get a little bit of pain every now and then even though it has been almost 4 years since I first got it so I take some Aleve (NSAID/Naproxen) to reduce the inflammation and then rest my shoulder for a few days.  When I first went to see my doctor about it I had the same explanation that you did which was that it just started hurting for no apparent reason.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	i would say also 'bursitis' <br>  <br>  keep heat to the area by warm wet compresses as often as feels comfortable for you and try not to use your arm.  confine your arm to a sling.  the less you use it the sooner you will get some relief.  <br>  <br>  ask your doctor or pharmacist for recommend anti-inflammatories such as aspirin or ibuprofin.  <br>  <br>  take care and get well soon
AA10975447	It helps to know what the flu is. Influenza is a viral respiratory ailment marked by fever, dry cough, sore throat, headache, body aches and severe fatigue. FEVER and COUGH are key.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me you're just prone to getting the common (and unpleasant) cold. They're caused by viruses, not cold air, fans or air conditioning.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid colds is to wash your hands with hot, soapy water on a very regular basis. You'd surprise yourself at how often you do things like rub your eyes and wipe your nose and just put your hands in contact with your mouth (such as while eating a sandwich). Your hands are a respository for germs. Washing them often prevents germs from getting into your body.<br>  <br>  If you can't get to a sink with soap and hot water, then carry hand sanitizer with you. The sanitizer needs to contain a minimum of 62% ethanol (ethyl alcohol).<br>  <br>  And to avoid the real influenza, make sure you get your flu jab every autumn!

It is recommended to take the pill at the same time each day to develop a routine to be sure you don't miss a dose entirely, but isn't meant to be clocked right down to the minute. If you are worried about the guidelines of taking the pill and when you should be concerned or should if you happen to miss a pill, take the time to ask for guidance from the Dr. who prescribed the pill or from the pharmacist where you purchase them. There shouldn't be any embarrassment in asking for a little more education, they'll be glad you asked!
zXgMbnTLaa	Bingo Wings is not the result of playing to much bingo but rather a natural condition that some women devellop as their bodies progress into older age. <br>  Howerver there are excercises that help tone up the biceps which in turn will firm up the surrounding flesh that has become unsightly.<br>  Press - ups or pull-ups on a horisontal bar will do the trick.<br>  <br>  Be carfull to start out gently with no more than six pulls per day during the first week. Increase this to ten per day the second week and then build up weekly untill you are doing 25 or more a day. <br>  It will take the best part of a year to really make a difference but its worth it if you want your arms to look attractive.<br>  <br>  Alternatively; wear a long sleaved jacket!

Jumping from around 14 years of primary and secondary education straight into 4 years of (incredibly differant and more intense) higher education takes alot out everbody. However, you've had a substantial rest (i'd suggest about a year of relaxing is good), and should probably get on with your plans for life. Go join the Corps, if thats what you still want to do. If you have no particular motivation or desire to follow any career, do some research into what fields your passions can take you. Screw jumping into a job you hate after 16-18 years of education XD

If you have to walk past your boss's desk, so be it -- he'll probably think you've passed gas.<br>  <br>  Go into the bathroom now while everybody's away, enter a stall, and take off your underwear.  Wash the dirty part with soap and water, rinse, and roll in several layers of hand towels to dry it as much as possible.  If there's a heated hand dryer, that will help a lot. <br>  <br>  Next take a damp towel and wash your rear end.  Don't flush the towel, though -- it might get stuck.  Wrap it up in another towel and bury it in the trash.<br>  <br>  If your trousers are soiled as well, put your underwear back on, even if it's damp, and wash, rinse, and dry the soiled fabric.  <br>  <br>  If the weather's decent, you can walk around outside for a bit, while your clothes dry.  Skip lunch!|`|09DE4NG3aa	The longer you leave it, the worse it will get.  Go to the bathroom now before it soaks through your trousers and leaves a stain.

RbULKPWOaa	There is a vital link between weight gained and insulin, metabolism, and body fat in women during perimenopause. <br>  <br>  Women should follow a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to control the weight gain. This diet creates a resistance to insulin in the body over an extended period of time. <br>  <br>  This resistance to insulin causes the body to convert every calorie into fat; this happens while you are dieting. As the conversion happens, the body becomes very effective in processing calories which in turn avoid excessive fat.
kD4OHI4caa	That's a lot of weight for 9 days, but it's possible. Definitely utilize the time you have in the gym, drink LOTS of water, and eat very, very lean foods.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily? The answer is... Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight. Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks! All by natural metabolism! And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works! You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|ObsaaHBgaa	you could probz lose that amount in 2 weeks but its still possible dont eat no carbs and keep exercising|`|7CmkRkEMaa	For 9 days do master cleanser (normally ten days) diet.

N9nJWYa5aa	How whey protein reacts in people with IBS varies from person to person.  For some people it's a good way to get protein as it doesn't react, for others the result is exactly what you've stated.<br>  <br>  Promax is a quality product, If it's causing you problems I'd tend to think that pretty much every other whey protein powder will do the same.  You may be able to find other protein supplements (non whey) that will work, but I'd write to the the suppliers stating your issues and asking for sample size products so you can see which work for you personally (trial and error I'm afraid).  Oh and bring the subject up with your doctor at your next appointment.

You may have moderate to severe brain damage, and at the far end of the spectrum, you may become a so-called "vegetable" - unable to function, and be putting a HUGE burden on loved ones, having to take care of you.|`|AA11175934	Iv also suffered anorexia and the first thing you should do is get help Because all thought you think your in control of your body your not by starving yourself your causing your hair to fall out because of depletion of protein your also causing your body to have Low blood pressure and heart failure and chances are by the time your reach the age 29 your going to become overweight because your constantly eating to regain all those I would recommend you get counseling because nothing is worth ending your precious life over enjoy your life to the fullest and your should get help try this website if it doesn't work you can try and contact me and i an help you find sites and groups who are also suffering your same condition<br>  <br>  eatingdisorderresources.com|`|nLtFLCMaaa	there is an enormous risk to have any permanent damages! if you've decided to commit suicide, don't do it this way. not only that if you survive, you will live an awful life, but also you might have mental disabilitites.

Than your body will start eating your brain tissue  and thats pretty much it. sooo you could be brain dead? bald...toothless.  basically a vegetable.  Is your life really that bad?|`|AA11787105	Depending on your metabolism it is hard to judge how long it would take you to actually perish from this.  As far as side effects, there are many and they are all pretty horrible.  It really depends on what level you reach, but you are looking at a life of being comatose.  Which is totally fun for you family.... NOT!.    <br>  <br>  Honestly, from my opinion you are probably too young to consider this option.  I would try and wise up and live for a while more.  Depression hits all of us, and honestly, I have had to deal with it for a long while, but there are many outlets.  The fact that you have to ask this question, tells all of us you aren't ready for the Big Out.  So just deal, and get questions about your more specific issues answered one here, and you will be fine.|`|H9rHtTz8aa	Too easy, before you died from not eating you would have a family member or friend notice and they would intervene. If you keep this up then you can expect damage to every organ in your body and most of this damage will be permanent you will also do irreversible damage to your brain so when you finally decide you want to live and you want to oh i don't know, lets say have a family and live a great life well stiff you wont be able to. Sound harsh, GOOD because you know enough in yourself to know you want to die then get help don't be so stupid, its obvious you want help or you wouldn't be talking about offing yourself, do yourself a favour and get help, i lost someone very very close to me from suicide and he never talked about it, i didn't miss any signs because he gave none. Get help or just kill yourself quickly and quietly so the rest of us can get on with living............|`|iA0Ka7aoaa	Oh, ****! Come on, do you really want to die? My sister works in a counseling office and c-riously, u probably hv more than fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty or mayB even ninety years to go if you take care of yourself! If you've been dumped by someone, CRITICALLY dumped, don't care! It's time to move on, girl! Death of a family member, friend or pet? Don't worry, I've had three dogs and they all were hit by cars. And look - it's not my ghost typing on these keys, is it? You can move on, do new things - i'm not asking you to forget anything but I'm IMPLORING you, please don't do this to yourself! It's ok if you don't go for counseling but still, why? Are you insane? Buck up!

Unless they are complete prudes, they know that at this age you're becoming sexually aware. So I would say use your fingers and become aware of your sexuality. Rub the "hood" until you ***. I'm a guy but trust me, girls get off on that. As for the toothbrush, that's just kind of gross. While the vibrations will get you off, remember where that toothbrush goes. Try buying a vibrator or just use manual techniques for now. If you don't want to get caught in your room, do it in the shower etc. Just remember, when you do decide to have actual sex, use protection.|`|YtRB9Mhtaa	Do it in the shower with the toothbrush.

It is a syndrome.<br>  <br>  My wife has suffered with this for years. It obviously has the capability to impact on my sleep as well as hers, so it is in my interest to find a management tool.<br>  <br>  To this end I have investigated and tried a variety of remedies, after taking advice from experts at our local pain clinic.<br>  <br>  The problem is that conventional pain killers do not work.<br>  <br>  I have found three effective controls, to foreshorten and limit attacks:<br>  <br>  1.   Massage: Leg and thigh massage can and does reduce the irritant factor.<br>  <br>  2.   Freeze spray, or co-codamol gel. The freeze spray is an effective remedy, permitting the sufferer to get to sleep. Once asleep, the effects tends to be muted. The co-codamol gel is also effective.<br>  <br>  3. TENS and ENS machines can also help. Using the TENS machine, with the pads placed on or close to the hip joints can obscure the pain signals. It takes some practice to find the most effective spots, but it is a powerful tool in combating the syndrome. I use a more sophisticated (and expensive) unit, which delivers two separate programs through 4 pads. This permits separate control at each hip.<br>  <br>  The ENS (Electronic Nerve Stimulator) is a more localised control tool. If your attacks start in the same localised spot, then application of this useful little tool can nip the attack in the bud. Several applications can ward of further attacks for several days, if not weeks. I use this device for other pain control situations.<br>  <br>  Now You will find that these remedies do not work all the time. They tend to be effective for a period of time and then, inexplicably fail. Therefore cycling the treatments is necessary, to maintain control.<br>  <br>  Combinations of treatment are also very powerful. I generally start with TENS, or ENS and, at bedtime massage gel into my wife's legs and thighs. This always allows her to get to sleep and most of the time provide full relief....... although temporary.........<br>  <br>  During the day, walk it off.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	If quinine has been made illegal there drink quinine water..tonic water.|`|PUAUR9Quaa	sorry but i have never heard of this disease and it sounds like when you sit down you leg decides to start dancing and take cocaine lol <br>  <br>  i apologize if you found this offensive

M2XQMPNNaa	Is it an oil inside a gelatin capsule? Then yes, it is fine to put it on your face! In fact, there are bottles of vitamin E oil, (which is the same as whats inside the capsule) available at the health food store or drugstore for just this purpose. Vitamin E is beneficial to your skin, and in it's more pure form moisturizes your skin without the harsh chemical fragrances, stabilizers and alcohol or glycerin that are in most facial creams. Be aware that it is an oil, so if you are prone to breakouts it may not be the best choice for all over your face. If this is the case, just dab the oil gently under your eyes (being careful to not get it anywhere near your eye and NOT putting it on your upper lid where it can migrate down and into your eye). If your face tends to be dry all over then gently rubbing it into your skin after you cleanse will have a very nice benefit. Believe it or not, olive oil (NOT olive oil that is blended with other oils but pure extra virgin olive oil) is also extremely good for your skin when applied in the same way. Wash with a gentle cleanser and then while your face is still damp gently massage the olive oil in, being careful around your eyes and again NOT on your upper eyelid. If your skin is very dry you can just leave it in place or you can leave it in place for at least 15 minutes and then gently wipe off either in the shower or with a damp washcloth. your skin will be soft and supple!!|`|inFdpMr6aa	definetly not|`|nxmDKS8oaa	NO!

8UozWw0Paa	it sounds more like self-control issues. a major part of bulimia is the person wants to feel 'in control', but it's possible this is being let out through drinking alcohol. <br>  talk to your doctor, or ask your friends not to let you drink on nights out. if they're decent enough, or sensible when drinking, you'll be fine.<br>  just think "what do I gain from this?" because you'll be back to square one the next day with a hangover, and annoyed because you gave in again.<br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|ruamFLoiaa	I think you may know the answer to your question.  <br>  <br>  The things you are doing to yourself are really dangerous.  I think you need to seek help before you cause permanent damage to your health.|`|AA10408209	Been there, done that. Yeah, if your asking, you most likely have some sort of problem with alcohol especially when you have problems saying no. Since you have depression, you should stay away from alcohol because it worsens those symptoms and anxiety later on after your the effects go away. In addition, you may drink to escape your negative feelings and that is a bad, bad path to be on because you aren't really bad now but things can go from bad to worse when a substance is involved. I definitely suggest kicking your drinking or at the very least cutting back (but you said if you have one, you have a compulsive desire to drink more so cutting back may not be an option...I had the same problem). I didn't drink every day but when I did drink, there was no stopping me...Good luck to you and I hope you are able to get past this before it gets the best of you. Take Care :)
IsxB0Qi7aa	I think you already know the answer to your question.<br>  <br>  If you're still very depressed it is because anti depressants don't work effectively if you are abusing alcohol at the same time.<br>  <br>  If you are bulimic the treatment for bulimia involves psychological counseling so you can understand and reduce triggers of binge eating by examining your relationships and emotions.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	Alcoholics go to meetings.  <br>  <br>  But seriously, my roommate can't drink because it messes her depression meds up.  Check with your psychiatrist/doctor to see if you should avoid drinking while you're taking depression meds.  If you are worried about being possibly underage, remember that you have doctor/patient privilege.|`|8e2a5c876451c62bb4e7b58bbcdec910aa	you are not an alcoholic, believe me.<br>  <br>  you should try to avoid the people your drinking with, its the best way, and dont take much money out when you do go out, make it impossible for you to be able to buy alcohol, and tell your friends not to give you any because you really need to cut it out|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	ditch the alcohol and lay off the anti depressants slowly. Alcohol is a depressant, then you get anti depressants in tablets and you probably also get a stimulant (nicotine) (first hand or second hand smoking) into the system. Add to that the stress (tests etc) and no wonder your system is all shot up.<br>  <br>  IMO to start - lay off the stimulants/ depressants mix. then work on yourself.<br>  <br>  alcoholic? if you can lay off the booze for 30 days you should be OK. If you start hallucinating after 3-4 days being dry- then you're hooked
3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	You should be drinking lots of water and cranberry juice. The mixed juices will likely be less effective because they contain less cranberry.<br>  <br>  The reason why your doctor didn't give you antibiotics is because the medical community is beginning to realize the danger of giving out antibiotics unnecessarily. It's resulting in bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics and therefore more difficult to treat.<br>  <br>  I believe it's also because antibiotics increase your chances of yeast infections.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, the reason I know the answer to this is because my ex-wife had a number of UITs and yeast infections while we were married.|`|AA11492002	any infection can go away on its own.... UTI tends to have frequent painful and bloody urination...  if symptoms get worse the doc should give you a prescription... no woman I know of has ever not gotten a prescription for this...|`|rLsphyqhaa	Just the sheer fact that you are a female you are subject to some infections. Always wipe from front to rear stay away from the thongs and g string underwear if that is what you like then take care of your self, try to wear cotton ones they do make them in many pretty colors and styles. they look just as sexy and pretty in my eyes not that I get to see you in them they can also make you feel good. Drinking the cranberry juice does help a great deal they make plenty of flavors. Most if not all women when they take any kind of medicane that has antibody's in it normal cause a yeast infection. Thus more troubles for you as a woman. If you are sexual active this can also bring on some troubles, he should be clean in hands and penis. Best of luck to you.

y4SUDnpaaa	I remember several of your other questions and I don't think this new job is the only thing on your mind. From what you asked in the other questions you are having real problems with your bf. I think you built up how much you would love this job into an unreasonable expectation. Maybe subconsciously thought this job would deflect some of the hurt from your bf. When we're depressed or under a lot of stress it carries over into other parts  of your  life spoiling things that you would otherwise enjoy. I can't remember the details of the issues with your bf but I can't help but believe until you've settled them one way or the other you're not going to have the proper outlook in all other areas of your life. As for the job, give it at least a month and of you still fell the same way   look for a job you're better suited for. The best time to get a new job is while you still have the old one. You may find this job really is what you want if you try  it a little longer and if you can come to some kind resolution about your bf. You should see a counselor or therapist to help you work through these issues.

Ga5jidiIaa	Hi!<br>         well, seeing the symptoms that you are telling one can only make a differential diagnosis, that the possibilities but the sure answer would be the one after investigations, well the differentials are:<br>  pneumonia<br>  effusion<br>  pneumothorax<br>  bronchitis etc<br>  <br>          alright now, you said you have a chest pain which is more specific for pneumonia than bronchitis comparitively...secondly headache may also occur more frequently with pneumonia.Pneumonias may occur all of a sudden with no history of other disease or may occur at times with a history like if some body aspirates somnething or may be preceded by infectiopns of the throat...<br>     also one thing very important about pneumonia is that there is fever and chills with it...<br>      I bronchitis you have a productive cough which means that the cough has sputum with it while in pneumonia you have a dry cough initially and then later on you have a productive cough.....<br>       Any how, with the information you have given, the probable thing would be pneumonia, secondly a condition called effusion, tension pneumothorax which has almost the same symptoms and gets worse as there is air trapped in the pleura;l cavity and bronchitis would be on the fourth as far as i think but whatever it is, it would be confirmed after the investigations with x-ray being the most important one, sputum cultures and also blood pulmonary function tests may be performed along with the proper and complete history including the details of the fever, cough and rogors and chills and also the clinical examination which would include teh pulse, respiratory rate, the movement of the chest with respiration.....<br>           so get your full examination and treatment on time ....<br>  <br>            goodluck|`|HRr2lQcaaa	You should listen to your Mom

Totally unscented and gets rid of pretty nasty odors in my car.
cH18CCV6aa	well im not sure what crutches you're on but i had elbow crutches, i broke my leg almost 13 weeks ago today, when i first did it i was given my crutches and they didnt tell me how to use them or anything so with my plaster on i crutched out the hospital and as i did i slipped onto my leg straight away...not very clever, im still at school too but i live about 2-3 miles away and i couldnt crutch in so i was getting lifts in and just going from one end of the school to the other was killing me...the school is pretty big, it wasnt until i was allowed to put weight on my leg that the crutching got alot easier, because your arms arent used to holding your weight so its hard. Depending on your injury your healing time will be different and you may not be able to weight bare at all or you may already be weight baring but for my first 6 weeks i wasnt allowed to put weight down and these were a very hard 6 weeks, it didnt get easier but i did get faster and more confident.

LPO8RlVdaa	Hi, your weight is fine and Im guessing that you will have a fairly healthy body fat level. Also you calorie intake is fine (I am assuming here you are an adult female)?<br>  <br>  As far as the diet goes that is great too, eat healthy most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with a few treats a week.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER ... Despite all this I would still say yes you need to excercise. Not to lose weight or anything, but to get fitter, as this will give you a lot of other health benefits later in life.|`|skgN9TJLaa	You don't need to exercise but i would recommend doing a little but not to try to lose weight just to keep healthy maybe just 20-30 mins a day.|`|ad3eed5e010d030690dfa887742daacdaa	if i calculated is right, 1 stone being 14 pounds, then you would be 112? if that is your weight, your underweight! i weight 5'8" and weight 140, which goal weight.<br>  1500 calories is the lowest amount of calories to loose weight on, without eating muscle, but i don't know why you want to loose. i was best at 133 All my life, with tons of exercise which i loved. Deprivation leads to binges, good for you if you can fit them in...personally i had to cut out bread and sugar, the cravings went away, and i do light exercises as i am disabled.<br>  Please reconsider eating 1800, and accept your body at that size, as there is a set-point that your body will migrate to, even if your dieting, that's why diets don't work, and people gain the previous weight +more, as they binge from the deprivation of goods they love.|`|xfgVGqvXaa	You are slightly underweight, so you don't need to exercise for weight loss.

LPO8RlVdaa	Okay, for most people it is perfectly healthy and normal for a stomach to stick out a little bit. (Just a little bit!!!)<br>  <br>  How much it sticks out depends on two things, your somatotype (body shape) and your body fat levels. <br>  <br>  If you are an ectomorph body shape (basically lean and slim) it will stick out a lot less than a mesomorph or especially an endomorph (higher levels of adipose tissue, more rounded). <br>  <br>  The single most important thing however is your body fat levels. As long as this is within a healthy range then you ae fine. If it goes up too much I'm guessing your stomach will be sticking out too much! So you will have to get this tested.|`|AA11066099	Hi, the majority of people eat far too much than we are supposed to.Everyones body is different and the golden rule is never eat until you are full as this stretches your stomach beyond what it should be.x|`|ad3eed5e010d030690dfa887742daacdaa	a nutritionist and athlete consultant once said, 'the only time you have a flat stomach is when you wake up in the morning~!"<br>  Personally, i have smoothies for breakfast(with protein powder)<br>   and it still stays flat, till i eat.<br>  The vagina bit is not seen in any magazine i've read, but it may make your question more interesting, and you will get some weird answers as a result.<br>  your moms right.!|`|85KL0eUUaa	well, the flatter your stomach is, the more in the correct place your internal organs are<br>  <a href="http://www.fitness.com/articles/uploaded/1172112166_fotolia_1598328.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitness.com/articles/uploaded...</a> that is good and healthy<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l207/skinnies2/4d9efeca.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l207/s...</a> that isn't.

FSuHBCMHaa	There are steps you can take to hold it off and stop it progressing.<br>     one big change you can make is to eat a healthy diet. Hair is mainly protein so eating a poor diet will have a direct effect on your hair. your diet should be rich in vitamins, proteins and minerals. If your not sure your getting them you can try hair growth pills. These provide the vitamins and proteins your hair needs. good ones also include DHT blockers which prevent DHT being produced and attacking your hair follicles.<br>      The other thing to do is change your shampoo to a neutral one that will not damage your hair or scalp. All this will help.<br>      One final thing. I would not go near chemical treatments like propecia. They have nasty side effects including erectile dysfunction and impotence. I found this out after taking it and my girlfriend immediately noticed some problems, if you get my drift. luckily the side effects cleared after I stopped taking it.|`|7mCCAqXzaa	Marcus it is all in the family gene pool if your reletives are bald you may be bald too it all comes with the shape of your nose color of your eyes and the size of your junk all part of the Gene pool <br>  <br>  <br>  curtdude|`|NXBmcEz7aa	In the next life (reincarnation) if you have a choice, choose not to be born with a family who is bald.|`|DtV8OLOoaa	There is no way to prevent it im afraid.

I've been smoking for 30 years and have tried everything to quit smoking without any success.  I will be ordering my electronic cigarette starter package this week and I'm very excited about it.  They simulate a real cigarette which none of the other quit smoking aids have done.  They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  And there is a 30-day money back guarantee so you have nothing to lose.  I will be ordering from the site below.|`|yev2iWgWaa	go to deaddiction center.they will make you stop smoking.for your information by smoking you can get oral cancer .esophageal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer and heart disease. enough?|`|AA11787105	Honestly the patches work great....  at least they did for me..... the issue is wanting to quit, and then of course once you are off them not lighting up a single one, ...... because just one innocent smoke and you are back

They are:<br>  <br>  1) Candida - This is a yeast, which lives in all of us, and is normally kept under control by our immune system and other bacteria in our body. It usually lives in the digestive system. Candida has no useful purpose. If it stays quiet and in balance, it causes no harm. The problem starts if Candida multiplies out of control and then it can create havoc with our health and wellbeing. Candida has been shown to cause insatiable food cravings – particularly for all sugary foods, bread, cakes, biscuits, fruit/fruit juices and vinegary/pickled foods.<br>  <br>  2) Food Intolerance means, quite simply, not being able to tolerate a particular food. Food Intolerance develops when you have too much of a food and too often and your body just gets to the point where it can’t cope with that food any longer. Food Intolerance can also make a person feel horribly unwell. The real irony is that Food Intolerance causes people to crave the foods to which they are intolerant. You are most likely to be intolerant to anything you have daily and feel you couldn’t live without (let me guess - cakes, biscuits, bread, cereal, pizza - all those are signs of wheat intolerance).<br>  <br>  3) Hypoglycaemia is literally a Greek translation from “hypo” meaning ‘under’, “glykis” meaning ‘sweet’ and “emia” meaning ‘in the blood together’. The three bits all put together mean low blood sugar. Hypoglycaemia describes the state your body is in if your blood sugar levels are too low. When your blood sugar levels are too low, this is potentially life threatening and your body will try to get you to eat. Hypoglycaemia can cause cravings for any carbohydrate – even fruit.<br>  <br>  If you are craving anything from fruit to pickled food to sweets to cereal - all cravings can be explained by these 3 things. I have literally written a whole book on these conditions and how you get rid of them (and therefore your food cravings) and what the best diet is to get rid of food cravings. <br>  <br>  I hope this gives you a flavour (excuse the pun) of what's going on and that it explains that you're not bored - you're a food addict (but you can overcome this).<br>  All the best - Zoe|`|pkqpVY7Raa	Do something else when you're bored, find a project for yourself like re-decorating or exercising.|`|26XZYNopaa	Listen to the Veronicas.

Go to the doctors.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	go to the doctors.  it is very important that you get good treatment, medicines and take very good care of your fingers and toes.  blood circulation to these areas is such that it takes longer to heal and is exposed to the most bacterias.  you should be wearing open toed shoes, the toe should be cleaned at least 3 times a day and soaked if necessary in warm water.  debris the toe for dead skin cells will help the nail to move forward and soaking will help the nail and skin to be soft and come in smooth.  <br>  <br>  you should see a doctor for topical antibiotics and possibly oral antibiotics and he should offer you a good cleaning and bandaging regimen as the nail grows.  <br>  <br>  one thing that you might do is have a nail salon put an acrylic nail on the new growth in order for the nail to grow straight and on the surface of skin in order for the new tender nail not to curl into your skin.  the acrylic should be tended to every few weeks until the nail grows out fully.<br>  <br>  take care!|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	it depends on how it looks<br>  <br>  radical option- if the ingrowth and infection is serious- go see a surgeon and have it removed again.<br>  <br>  conservative option- if it looks like the ingrowth is not too bad and will resolve itself if given time- then foot baths in salt solution/ light disinfectant (eg Chamomile tea as a foot bath); then (once the skin is softened by the water) try to evacuate the pus with a blunt piece of plastic or a used up bic pen (unless you want a do-it-yourself tatoo). repeat daily till the toe nail gets long enough to clear the skin (do not cut the toe nails untill they are beyond the skin surface- or else it will all start again)<br>  <br>  Had ingrown toenails myself. Surgical solutions only made it worse. Best effect was footbath and bic pen repeated for 3 months- nothing drastic just keep it clean and let the pus drain. Slow and painful but once the toe nail outgrew the skin it cleared real fast.|`|3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	go back to your doctor or the hospital where it was done I had the same problem and they removed the nail a second time and put some antibiotic powder on it and also gave me a course of antibiotics

AA12262106	You are right about the possibility of the hymen (correct spelling)being broken by activity other than sexual relations.<br>     In fact, it's inaccurate to base claims of virginity or lack thereof on the condition of the hymen.<br>     In practical terms that means that your gyno won't know for sure whether or not you've masturbated.|`|USsDzaIsaa	Masturbation is not a disease.  So your gynaecologist couldn't care less if you masturbate or not.  They wouldn't waste time looking.  :)<br>  <br>  Billibadazz: No women are born "technically not virgins".  A virgin is someone who has never had sex.  If a female is born without a hymen, then she is merely a female without a hymen.  It is simply an anatomical rarity.

Just playing, unless you're hymen is shredded, they can't tell. Even if it is broken, unless it is shredded, like I said before, it might just be the result of a normal activity such as horse riding or bike riding or for some girls, just being born. Yes, some girls are born technically not virgins. Which just goes to show you that sexuality is a personal thing. Keep that in mind. Your gyno is not going to judge you. They're usually professionals who won't tell your parents anything is amiss unless you have a disease or something wrong that warrants attention. Masturbating is not wrong and so professionally does not warrant attention.|`|LrGmpacOaa	Hymens are not a good indicator of virginity. They can break from tampon use, vigorous sports, or, like you mentioned, horseback riding.

Nothing you do causes psoriasis, it is also that simple. A psoriasis diet will not magically cure your psoriasis, neither will steroids or powerful vitamin derivative type drugs that alter your immune system. We have created this page explicitly to answer this single question as we receive many hundreds of emails each month asking us for a psoriasis cure.<br>  Don't believe a word of it! There is no cure for psoriasis. Unfortunately and despite the promises of many web sites there is no such thing as a true cure for psoriasis. The best that a suffer can realistically hope for is long term remission, where the symptoms seems to fade away. The disease does not have any medically recognised cure. This does not mean though that there Is no hope of a cure in the future. With the introduction of the new Biologic forms of treatment it is hoped that longer term viable relief can be given to sufferers everywhere. It is best to concentrate on the treatment and reduction of psoriasis, not look for a magic cure that does not exist (unfortunately.)<br>  Unfortunately there is NO psoriasis cure but there are psoriasis treatments.

YifhZGtyaa	to loose body fat you need to burn the fat, so whatever you eat you need to excersize excessively, but not way too much, and you need to do it day after day or your body won't rest and instead of increasing your metabolism, it will slow down even more in order to retain energy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Diet isn't that important (as long as it's a normal diet and not rediculus) all you need to do is to excersise day after day (leave 1 day to rest) and when eat, eat a little and often.<br>  <br>  <br>  Common mistakes :<br>  <br>  Less food :<br>  <br>  Less food means your body will eventually slow down burning cause it will learn that it will receive energy (food) in X hours of X amount so the metabolism will go down in order to preserve energy. Main reason why crash diets don't work and fat is never lost, it's water and muscle.<br>  <br>  Exercise daily :<br>  <br>  If you work out on a daily basis then you're overusing your energy supplies and your body will do the reverse. Due to too much energy loss your metabolism will go down in this case too.<br>  <br>  What is needed :<br>  <br>  You can eat anything, as long as it isn't excess. (like don't eat 500gr of chocolate or 6 hamburgers).<br>  <br>  A diet program should be like this :<br>  <br>  <br>  (assuming this is your hour of waking up)<br>  <br>  8: am : Big breakfast<br>  11 am :small brunch (a fruit or half a sandiwich)<br>  2 pm : medium lunch (3/4 of a normal portion)<br>  4 pm : fruit/veggie salad<br>  6-8 pm : half a dinner<br>  10 pm : 1 fruit (if that's the aprox time you sleep)<br>  <br>  This helps your body know that since energy is going to come within the next hours, it won't store energy and your metabolism will go up.<br>  <br>  Exercise.<br>  <br>  Any exercise is good, but it should be day after day, like<br>  <br>  Monday : exercise<br>  Tueseday : rest<br>  wednesday : exercise<br>  thursday : rest<br>  <br>  and so on.<br>  <br>  This way, your body won't be alarmed for excessive calorie loss and won't start storing fat.<br>  <br>  I used to be obease (140 kilos)<br>  and i currently am 55 kilos, i didn't starve and i lost all my weight in a year and a half.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, if you're hoping on a miracle thing, then it won't happen.

You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|B7exu9owaa	My dear,<br>  <br>  I've studied weight loss and nutrition for many years and your diet is absolutely wonderful!  Complex carbs are a boon to energy and weight loss.  Your diet includes adequate protein to fuel your muscles, complex carbs for energy and plenty of nutritious veggies.  You've obviously done your homework.  I think you know you're on the right track.  <br>  <br>  Kudos!<br>  GG
l1UwQRBTaa	My rabbit had that, I think it is mites, just clean out their hutch and run more often and feed them lots of fresh fruit, I burshed his fur regularly, but it does go away on its own and doesnt spread.
ZG6DeAzPaa	lol, ok... once more.<br>  <br>  I hate doing this, but I end up having to do it 10+ times a year because my schedule shifts. <br>  <br>  You either have to stay up all day/night or sleep for like 15 hours. If you have nothing to do... and think you can sleep that long. That one is much easier. If you are going to stay up, it can be helpful to eat like your schedule is already fixed. So for you....Eat breakfast at 6am.. and dinner at 6pm. <br>  <br>  If you have trouble staying up... do not do it with caffeine... It wont work and you'll feel terrible. Just stay out of the bed, and keep busy. I have heard that if you don't eat it can make you stay awake because hungry animals shouldn't go to sleep, they should keep hunting. I have never had the willpower not to eat, cause I loves me some food. :P<br>  <br>  The main problem I run into with this is waking up at 2AM and not being able to fall asleep. I just stay up a little bit later every day... and go to sleep a little later every day. Eventually you can get it where you want it. Hope this helps.|`|b536895bf6c779e662d180730661813faa	HAHA you sound exactly like me. I've been up since 3pm and it's currently 8am but I'm starting a new cycle starting this week. How I plan to do it?<br>  <br>  Tire yourself out for one day. But don't take a nap! Naps will totally screw everything up and keep you up when you should be asleep, as well avoid caffeine substances for the next few days.|`|yev2iWgWaa	create interesting activities of your taste get into exercises at gym where you will interact with others and forget of sleep do not eat heavily take  breakfast lightly and after few hours you can eat some fruit and small lunch do gardening.you will be fascinated by their growth and blooming flowers and fragrance.like this be active throughout day .once you retire in bed think of day activities.close your eyes and relax your body part by part.keep your favorite music in low tone sleep will embrace you.continue|`|x1qKGmzSaa	well, either set an alarm to wake you up earlier, or stay up all night until 9 pm then you'll be on schedule. thats what im doing. well trying to do, hopefully i dont fall asleep. haha<br>  <br>  :)|`|8y4DyklCaa	its just easy.... don't take a nap at noon time instead you do your work in the day and by night you'll be tired and hit your bed.|`|AA11606079	OMG I HAVE THAT PROBLEM TWO I WAKE UP AROUND FIVE AND STAY UP TILL 10 THE NEXT MORNIN =( SO SOME ONE PLESE AWNSWER US|`|9acdd3cb37fb6f2828336bb7a9af3b17aa	just do it<br>  find something really exhausting to do and try to get in bed at 9 pm..and set your alarm clock
R0tzhAXLaa	Back, for me i find them safer and more balance|`|SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  Front squats are easier to perform but front squats are still performed by many. These two types of squats accomplish different things so it is not really a matter of liking. One has to think about what one wants to accomplish. You don′t see many powerlifters (if any) performing front squats. Some bodybuilders on the other hand will perform them.
b8a51f5098090ab33a464a74631f3bd9aa	First of all it's not a problem, our foreskin is there for that reason... to cover the head, which is naturally sensitive. If you're hoping to one day see your foreskin retract it's self (while being soft), you should give up hope. Now on the other hand, the skin might retract on its own when you get hard. This happens with most guys, depending on how much foreskin we have and also how big our penis is. If you're 15 now then your penis is still in the growing stage. It's said that the penis can still continue to grow within 10-15 years after our teenage years but this does not mean that every guy will be lucky and grow some more. Now, it you have issues with your skin being tight... don't worry, you are already helping without even knowing. Keep retracting your foreskin every chance you get... when you have to piss, in the shower, when you jerk (try making the skin go back & forth). By you retracting the skin as often as possible, you will help loosen it & stretch it. Many of the answers here talk or even suggest circumcision but I did not read anywhere in your question that circumcision was something you were thinking about or want. I hope this is true... I strongly disagree that it's better or a solution in your situation. I also want to comment a little on whether being cut makes sex better or if uncut feels better. Of course it's going to feel different if cut or uncut. Us guys with skin & a sensitive head might enjoy sex or getting sucked much more than if we were to have the skin cut & our penis heads desensitized. Not sure about you but most of the guys I know, along with myslef, that have skin get good pleasure by just having our heads and skin played with. I have even ejaculated several times by just having my head pleasured. I guess I should stop now before I realy go off track and hope this helps you some. But before I go, I just have to know if anyother uncut guys would have their skin snipped just to join the lucky cut guys who are getting sucked 24/7 year round.   lol|`|2OO9U8o9aa	It will happen over a period of time especially when you are sexually active .When you get round to sex with a partner it will naturally retract during penetration . In the meantime just keep it retracted when you masturbate m you may need some lube though . Like most young guys you will be masturbating every day and this will also help things in the direction you want , No need to be worried about this , just keep the area underneath clean in the shower each day retract and rinse the head under warm water|`|nA1g26y0aa	Here's the solution. If you want to expose your head totally, get a circumcision. You may find a doctor who would only remove a portion of your foreskin so that when you're flaccid the foreskin will still cover your head, but when you get hard it could "naturally" retract. Remember, surgery is surgery. There will be some pain after the procedure.|`|rFUqIakAaa	Why? The way it is now is exactly how it's supposed to work. You have no medical problem and no deformity so what is there to fix? Everybody's foreskin is different (length, thickness and tightness) so there are all different but yours sounds normal to me.<br>  <br>  Now if you are talking about an extremely tight foreskin, then here is the solution:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/tight_foreskin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/ti...</a>|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Circumcision is the only way I know to have your penis head exposed without pulling it back yourself.  Can you get back to me and tell me why you want to have your foreskin retract by itself?  I was just wondering.|`|4arnbpUCaa	This is not a "problem".<br>  You just have a long foreskin which is why it doesn't automatically retract. Mine doesn't either and its never caused me any grief.|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	some people can, some people can't. you're still 15 so maybe in the future, it could be possible.<br>  <br>  otherwise, go get circumcised if it bothers you soo much.|`|nhRkWbWcaa	i dont think that there is a solution, ur just gonna have to do it urself :p|`|0H17Ohjkaa	do it yourself you lazy arsehole|`|TsjqzanQaa	First of all, it's not a problem.<br>  <br>  The foreskin, like any other body part, has different lengths, thicknesses, etc., which vary from individual to individual.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your foreskin is longer than most.<br>  <br>  There isn't any problem if it doesn't retract by itself, with sexual activity it will have the motion and retraction that is what is so beneficial about having a foreskin in the first place.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine if you were to have it amputated by the mutilation of circumcision?       You wouldn't have the nerve endings that your foreskin has, veins and blood vessels would be severed, the skin would be tight, with no skin movement during sex or masturbation, and your sexual sensitivity would be decreased, together with the intensity of orgasms.<br>  <br>  You should be thankful that your parents loved you enough to leave you intact, so that you can enjoy the feeling and benefits of having a complete penis instead of one that was mutilated and scarred by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Look at one of the videos on the internet and see just what it is that they do to helpless infants.      Animals are treated better than that in the USA.<br>  <br>  It may make you thankful that they didn't do that to you.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	Its not how they work.  Most foreskins have considerable overhang. Some more then others.  It you have a long one you're in luck.  Not because of what you want it to do but because the foreskin is the penis.<br>  <br>  Let me explain.  Most cut guys love oral when they get.  More so then intact males.  The reason is that we are getting oral all day long.  We have a girls lips around our tool 24 hours a day 365 days a year all of our life.  What cut male would not want that ?<br>  <br>  Getting back to your issue - I will not ask what you are trying to do something like this.  I can only say that a normal foreskin will cover the entire penis and then some despite being fully erect.<br>  <br>  There is good reason for this. You want the foreskin to caress the entire glands while erect because the glans is not what trigers climax as many here in the state believe.  Even doctors do not know because they themselves do not have one.  To a cut male the glands is the only feeling they get.  Not so for you.<br>  <br>  In your case the glans is only providing 10 percent of the climax ability you have.  The 90 percent is all the foreskin, and primarily when the tip of the glands punches through it.  In effect its like a built in girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Make no mistake here.  Masturbation in an intact males is very much like sex.  About 100 times closer then when a cut male tries to.  In short nature made the foreskin as you see it for this reason.  The more overhang the better.<br>  <br>  When a girl has sex with an intact guy she is holding on to your outer skin as your hand is now doing. She goes even further by pulling it back all the way.  The effect causes a strangulation effect locking the blood in the member.  This is why many foreskins are tight.  It works like a **** ring product but installed by nature not man.<br>  <br>  Knowing the dynamics of the tool will present value to function.  The more you know the better you will be at sex.  Try it yourself and see.  Pull the skin forward and loose an erection.  Pull the skin back as far as possible and it lock an erection in place.<br>  <br>  Longer is better.   For you shorter readers you might want to know that while its practically impossible to lengthen a penis.  The foreskin will stretch and to many times its original length.<br>  That is why tight ones are never any concern.  Certainly not enough to warrant cutting them off.<br>  <br>  Your BEST ANSWER|`|7mCCAqXzaa	Dude your uncircumcised and that is the way it is suppost to be if your uncircumcised the skin will cover the head the only way to make it so that the head is allways exposed it to get circumciced they will get a pair of scissors and cut it off and stich it up under anesthesa.  <br>  <br>  curtdude|`|i6RlYFo7aa	i honestly don't see a problem here<br>  a lot of guys' foreskin doesn't retract when erect, once you have sex the skin will retract on it's own with movement|`|MCeh0uIaaa	Solution? Circumcision?|`|72iZuDjeaa	if you keep your foreskin retracted you will desensitize your "head"... this is what happens to circumcised guys... this is not a preferred thing... your fine the way you are gab...

Surround yourself with thoughts of these people when suicide thoughts come back. Why try to "help" people who hurt you? You wouldn't really be solving anything.  <br>  <br>  Your life has worth. With a different perspective you can find it. I really want you to, and I'm certain I'm not the only one. <br>  <br>  Your honest to goodness best bet is to focus on the future (these school years will go by fast) and prepare for a career that will make you feel good about yourself and provide a nice income. I know this is tough, but it is not meant as generic "get- over-it advice." If you can realize some purpose in living, you won't be bothered by every mean person out there because you will have found self-worth.<br>  <br>  What do you like to do? Find your interests and skills - everyone has them. Write them down. Think of how these interests and skills might be useful in the future. <br>  <br>  You need to also confide in one trusted adult (a parent, an aunt, gramma, neighbor?) about your feelings. Sessions with a counselor would be a good idea. You need loving support right now to see out of this darkness. Ask this adult to help you get counseling.<br>  <br>  You need to focus on positives. Picture this....you are in a dark tunnel. Along the way are these awful people making you feel this way, but ahead is light - a place to focus your attention on. Stop looking to the side, look ahead towards that light. Set a goal and picture it in the light. Anything positive - read an inspiring book, learn to ride a horse, learn a musical instrument, get an A in a certain class or classes.....each time you meet a goal, set another, and don't look to the side.    <br>  <br>  I want you to get well.<br>  <br>  Here is a hotline.

WGMOlie7aa	lol i also love the hula hooping  and SUPER hula hooping!...i feel like its working the muscles but i also do gym everyday and ab exercises so i really couldnt be sure if the wii is helping or not!|`|LRVInY5Vaa	Hula hooping on wii is fun and if you feel it in your belly you know its working.  If you have a little bit of a belly (some fat over muscle) you will have to do cardio exercise to remove that and get more flat there. <br>  <br>  To the poster above me, the reason why acai berry works and 'flattens' your stomach is because it makes you go to the bathroom more.  Same as fiber.  Less waste in your stomach, the 'flatter' it is and 'less' you weigh.  If you think keeping your intestines empty and pooping away your weight is the way to go, great for you but there is no proof that it takes and keeps the weight off besides what was left in the toilet.
r0ZiwS8qaa	You confused me.<br>  - Ask your dentist whether having braces will hurt you in the future.<br>  - Get a selection of braces to chose from and chose the one that looks best.<br>  - If you can avoid braces do so.<br>  - To strengthen teeth, ensure you brush 2 - 3 times a day and don't eat or drink too much fatty or acidic foods and drinks.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|5HOMRUeMaa	Braces are really no big deal at all.  Just because they do not cause any problem does not mean they will not be a problem.  If your teeth do not line up correctly, they rub together and wear each other out.
dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	Ok here's how it works. You are not 'protected' until you've been on the pill between 3 weeks and a month. Say you have sex monday but forgot to take it sunday then you are not protected. Then you should wait like a week so it gets back into your system. That help?|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Yes, of course you can get pregnant if you miss a day.  You need to take the pill consistantly every single day, even if you've been on it for years and you miss a day there is a risk of pregnancy.|`|7z8fjUi9aa	yea what renee said. but i just saw a commercial for a pharmaceutical called "Plan B" and its exactly what it sounds like. its a contraceptive that she MUST take within 72 hours of sex for it to work.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You can get pregnant if you miss pills however I don't know the relationship between the day of the missed pill and the day when having sex is dangerous. I think it's a couple of days apart, however it also depends on when the missed pill was (first week vs last week or whatever). I believe pill packets usually say if you've had sex the week before missing a pill in the first or last week then you're at risk, and you also should use back-up for a week after, so it's a big window to be extra sure.<br>  <br>  Harriet

I feel sorry for those who have it.<br>  <br>  It is a neurological disorder. You need to talk to someone who specializes in neurology or spine doctor.<br>  <br>  He/She should be able to pinpoint the problem. I do not know if there is a cure. Perhaps a chiropractor can do the adjustment and hopefully contain the twitching to a manageable level.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RZWiU7Jcaa	Well when he is asleep it could be from dreaming if he's awake it could be nerves.|`|F32uPjAraa	Because you make him nervous?

AjBpAPpdaa	Quite a lot, depends on your weight now and the rate of your metabolism|`|AA11940023	your body needs fuel, 600 calories is not enough to sustain your body.  You will lose weight but it is not healthy.  You may be able to get away with it for only 4 days, but it IS NOT HEALTHY.<br>  <br>  Drastic reduction in calories will signal your body that there is a shortage of food and your metabolism will dramatically slow down, making it harder to rev back up.<br>  <br>  I would never drop below 1,200 calories a day.  If you need fast results, exercise  more.  Make the calories that you do consume count.  make sure they are rich in vitamins and minerals and fiber.  Eat 6 or more small meals a day instead of starving all day and eating one big meal.  Spreading out your meals lets your body know that there is food and you are eating so no bad signals are sent to artificially trick your metabolism adversely. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|tw3Uzn1Caa	This isnt really a safe way to lose any kind of weight because your body without even excercising will burn close to 2,000 calories in a day just by doing your every day things.  Walking, breathing, sitting, talking, whatever it is.  You should go to google and find a BMR calculator where you enter your height, weight, and age and it will determine how many calories you burn on a daily basis without any kind of excersice.  and for 4 days that is only a short enough period to lose water weight you wont really lose any fat, if thats what you are going for.  It is a longer drawn out period of time to lose fat and usually goes by weeks.  You need to have a 3500 calorie deficit in a week to lose 1 pound.  That is 500 calories each day throughout the week and that can be lost be either eating less or excercising.  GOOD LUCK!|`|r1QLeM9yaa	different people have different metabolisms... impossible to say<br>  ;) gd luck though|`|R3NtFnfdaa	Why would you only want to eat 600 calories per day?<br>  That is not healthy man.|`|DBYyiHyCaa	a lot<br>  but u will faint a lot more

Eating that will slow your metabolism, cut down muscle tissue, and make it nearly impossible to lose weight. Take it from someone who has tried it.

Just so long as the body fat percentage is between 19%-27% this is healthy for your age and gender.|`|he18hGKNaa	Weight can be a curse if you're trying to reach a specific number.  Muscle weighs a lot more than fat, so when you exercise its possible for you to gain weight, while losing size.  The rule for a woman's healthy waist size is divide their waist measurement by their hip measurement, and it should be below 0.8.  Best thing to do would be to talk to a personal doctor, and see what they think can be done to have the best health.  Exercise regularly (jogging, pushups, situps, leg lifts, squats... theres hundreds of exercises you can do at home without any equipment) and you'll be just fine.|`|AE6Rap6vaa	WOW....13 and already 5'7......heres the thing to realize....because you are still so young you could be really thin and lanky and you'll more than likely fill in your curves by the time you are 16-18 years old OR you could still be tall and curvy with some baby fat and you'll more than likely thin out with age. You are not done growing and your body is going to continue to change as you age so no matter what anyone says about how much you SHOULD weigh, the truth is that everyone is different....as long as you are healthy then thats all that matters!|`|85KL0eUUaa	about 120lb/54.5kg|`|5t5oYIC8aa	115-125|`|cHuK9TLJaa	Should weigh bout 55kg or less|`|rvmiK8rgaa	There's no ideal Weight.

F4DhYjlnaa	I don't think so, you should take all your meds as prescribed. If the doc who gave you the Plan B didn't say "stop taking your other meds" then you should continue as normal. <br>  <br>  Do your research on their site just to be sure.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you bought it over the counter, call your nearest Planned Parenthood and ask them if there will be a problem with your other meds.

Of course you are NOT fat!! I would say you are quite young, not from anything your headless shot reveals but more because you are lacking in confidence. Looking for random strangers to comment on your body is a sign of immaturity and lack of self-confidence. You do realize that you have left yourself wide open to the often unkind, frequently weird and sometimes perverted people that comment to others through this forum?? Not a good idea at all. Start working on ways to build confidence in yourself by doing things that make you feel happy, proud and involved. Are you athletic, into art or drama or do you enjoy writing or working with animals? Find something you are passionate about and get involved. The confidence you feel by following through and pursuing your interests can never be found through asking for compliments from strangers on the internet.|`|SXqYdNpsaa	OMG You're HUGE!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Only kidding, you don't look fat at all!|`|bTT7ML6Aaa	no your not fat. your probably 16. i dont see how you think your fat your skinny i find that kind of odd....|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	noooooo ur so slim, yes u look 14|`|AA11452643	Not even close.

The key question is, are they managing their health? Just  like people with a disease like diabetes must manage their health, people with a mental health illness must take care of themselves through proper diet, medication, exercise, a good physician, etc.   <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean when you say "rocks back and forth"....not a phrase I am familiar with.  If you are just guessing that he has is ill, then that's probably not being fair to him.  If he has shared with you that he does have a mental heath illness, then that shows me he is probably very healthy and would be a great partner.  Not many people with a mental health illness can or will share it with others because of the unfortunate stigma still attached.   <br>  <br>  If this man does has a mental health disease and is doing what he is supposed to do to manage his health, I would date him.  If not, I can tell you from personal experience it could be challenging for you to become involved at this time.|`|kD4OHI4caa	Mental health issues are something you definitely need to consider...

SzYQVW0Naa	People think starving yourself will make you lose weight. That is the farthest thing from the truth. When you don't eat your body goes into starvation mode. So when you do eat EVERYTHING you eat is stored as fat.  When my wife wanted to lose weight I made her eat 5 small meal a day. And yes they are small. Stay away from sugar and salt. Salt is a water retainer. Check all the labels. And one more KEY thing. Get rid of the bread. What do you get when you mix flour with water?   Paste! My wife has been on a gluten free diet and has lost a tremendous amount of weight. This includes pasta, some cereals, including oatmeal, peas and corn is also bad when on a gluten free diet.  Anything that says enriched flour or wheat flour. And NO milk. Milk is loaded with hormones, testosterone, that ultimately adds weight. Tv. says milk has calcium. All I have to say about that is bull honkey That's garbage. If it has any at all it's very minute. If your able to rid of the gluten I'm telling you, you will feel 100% better and lose weight. Weight pills don't work. There is no magic pill.|`|inI1fkx7aa	Depends on where the calories are coming from.

Qw1T45ivaa	1 Have the person with the nosebleed sit down and lean forward so the blood does not flow down the respiratory passage, but keep the head above the level of the heart. <br>  Step2 Press a tissue or cold compress against the nostrils below the bone to encourage clotting. <br>  Step3 Have the person with the nosebleed keep his or her nostrils pinched together for 5 minutes without letting go, or until the bleeding stops. <br>  Step4 Replace the tissue or compress with a new one if it becomes soaked with blood. <br>  Step5 Leave a bowl next to the person so that he or she can spit out any blood that drips down their throat. <br>  Step6 Remove the tissue or compress slowly. If bleeding persists, continue pinching the nose for another 5 minutes. <br>  Step7 After bleeding stops, wash away any blood with warm water. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly inside the nostrils to moisturize the area. <br>  Step8 Make sure the person does not sniff or blow the nose for several hours afterward, as this could cause another nosebleed. <br>  Step9 If the nosebleed originates in the back of the nose and does not respond to treatment, seek medical attention. This type of nosebleed, called a "posterior" nosebleed, is common in older people and potentially very serious. <br>  Step10 Visit a doctor or an emergency room immediately if bleeding does not stop or if the patient is weak, pale or experiencing an elevated heart rate. Keep the patient leaning forward with the nose pinched on the way to the doctor's office or hospital.|`|HvsfZPbFaa	I'm sorry to hear about your nose bleeds.  My husband suffers from them occasionally, and believe it or not, here is what we do.  Firstly, he blows his nose, not hard, but blows it so that blood and clots will come out.  Secondly, keep your head up, not tilted back - you don't want to swallow any blood or choke on it - and last, but not least, and I know this will sound strange, I hold either a quarter or an ice cube on the bridge of his nose.  This has always worked - especially blowing your nose - it will get rid of the clots that much quicker and help to stop the bleeding.  Hope this helps you too.|`|hhufokOMaa	Nose bleeding occur due to many reason's,pls specify when it started and did u have ant trauma's or does any one in ur family have such problems.Better have it checked out by a doc,cuz 2days in a row is a bit serious!!Try the site below it might be of use 2 u..|`|YH375R9jaa	stop letting liberals punch you....JK.<br>  <br>  You might be low on Iron...just a guess, I had that problem when I was like 10 or 11, it was because I had a low amount of Iron....I think, that was like 18 years ago, I don't remember what my parents gave me to make it stop.|`|ETOlLd0jaa	when i was still a kid, my mom would make me tilt my head backwards and she'd place ice at the back of my neck. if this doesn't stop the bleeding, i suggest that you go to your doctor and have yourself checked.|`|4etHo5eXaa	im not gonna sniff around for the answer and im keeping my nose out off this bleedin question.|`|kNSGLgJQaa	cold wet wash cloth on the back of your neck slows the blood flow down<br>  and yeah, a tissue would help|`|yXiH06qSaa	stop picking your nose|`|Lm1MLdU1aa	get a napkin or tissue. pinch your nose, and hold your nose up and then wait. hope this works for you.=p|`|gpON465Iaa	be still, and breath through that nostril|`|7LtbetTFaa	Use Afrin or equivalent nasal spray.

If you are careful to boil your utensils, and keep the bathroom surfaces very clean, and watch out for where you are touching things, then you shouldn't have a problem, regardless of age.  <br>  <br>  Your colon doesn't absorb all that much nutrition, and you can't get "high colonics" without machinery, so you're in no danger of bulimia or anything else.  <br>  <br>  But your colon can become used to being cleansed manually and start to adjust to the new treatment.  If you don't want your peristalsis to change, you should keep it down to once a week or once every two weeks.  It's OK to do it three times in a week, if you then, give yourself a long break from it, like a couple of weeks.  <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with it if you use common sense, and use it in a hygienic way.|`|MDsufhrZaa	it will make digestions easier. it wont really make you lose stomach fat.<br>  <br>  what you should do is diet and exercise.<br>  worked for me.

AA11785060	Tell him to sleep elsewhere, He obviously doesn't respect you since you told him you don't like it, and he needs to sleep by himself.  Most married guys masturbate, but do so maybe in the shower or when the wife is not around and just a normal urge. But to deliberately ejac all over your spouse is rather rude and disgusting, I think too.  So tonight tell him as he gets in bed he is sleeping in the spare room or on the couch or floor or somewhere else until he can respect you.  If he has to masturbate he can go to the bathroom. Or as you say, he can wake you up and do the job right.    But don't tolerate it any longer.  That allows him to begin controlling you and thinking he can be domineering.  He may well need to see a sex counselor and you might suggest that to him.|`|FI916ISFaa	You don't mind him waking you up for some yet he would rather jerk off on you?

S5dtWq8jaa	I think women are less likely to be turned on by porn, but more likely with words and descriptions of sex.  Maybe look on internet to see if there are stories like that that people wrote...perhaps that could help.  However, I don't think it is a big deal if you don't like porn or the writing about sex, it isn't even a big deal if you never had an orgasm.  It would be wonderful if you have an orgasm, but if you don't, it is not the end of the world either (I think).|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Just remember that you are doing this to make yourself feel better. I suggest you start of by masturbating because you can get to know yourself and direct your husband when you are making love so he can please you. Soon enough you will know yourself so well and be able to achieve that orgasm. You don't have to watch porn to be able to get turned on. You can just be relaxing in bed and decide to masturbate. It helps relieve stress so just let yourself relax. Remember that you are doing this to improve your sexual relationship.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	use 2 person same time|`|LJ44MUmzaa	It sounds like you may be over-thinking it and not just enjoying the actual act itself - check out this site.

sVrkjixAaa	Because there is no benefit to living your entire life and not knowing the enjoyment you could have had by smoking an almost completely harmless plant. Also because you should not let the government (who, theoretically, work to protect our individual rights) tell you what you can and cannot put in your own body. Lastly, because what point is there to life if you can't enjoy it? Life is short, and there are few things more tragic than someone who continually lets others form his or her opinions for them.|`|f8KtdtDuaa	because its fun

I advise you to do it every other day man, because your body needs to rest up and your muscles need to repair. Just relax, and don't worry about it so much. Also, you could be eating a lot because you are stressing out too much about trying to lose weight.

nA1g26y0aa	You probably have two to four more years to grow. This later period of growth is not as noticeable as it was early in puberty, but yes, you will grow and so will your penis. Mostly you will notice that it will "thicken" somewhat (maybe not lengthen). At 6" of length (how tall are you), you are in the average range. If you want to LOOK bigger, try shaving your pubic hair. You don't have to shave it totally smooth, but shave the area just about the base of your penis. Try different amounts shaved to find the look you like. (Remember to use a new, sharp razor.) Also, if your pubes are "bushy," keep them trimmed short. (Experiment with the length you like too.)|`|JCdrJmJBaa	it depends on whether you have finished puberty yet if you haven't you penis could continue to grow until age 21. but 6 inches is regular .|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Probably but not very much more.  Every guy is different so I can't make a definitive answer but my guess is yes.|`|jBipWFPaaa	no they begin shrinking|`|AA11785060	Generally the penis is fully grown around 15-16 or maybe even earlier as  the penis and testicles develop rapidly at the onset of puberty and the rest of the body catches up. Only 12% of all males are over 6.2 inches by the way so you are certainly fine down below--of course 90% claim to be much bigger than that.|`|72iZuDjeaa	this is not an age driven thing, it's a puberty thing... everyone has differing lengths of puberty as well as start and stop times of growth... i started puberty when i was 11 and i didn't finish growing until i was almost 20...|`|2OO9U8o9aa	six inch is around average whcih means there are guys out there much bigger and others smaller .

It is big enough to satisfy a partner and make one pregnant|`|73fuqfSyaa	Yes! Your body will keep maturing (or growing) until you reach your twenties. Of course, everyone is different so no one can tell you the exact time, BUT yes, you will continue to grow. And size typically doesn't matter-unless you can't feel it inside you, and six inches is plenty big enough for that! So no worries dude! <br>  Steph.|`|t89erxkVaa	Your entire body keeps growing until about the age of 21.  So yes, your penis will continue to grow.

One thing is that you can stop anti depressant for a while when you are not that depressed. To my knowledge the mood disorders have natural swings and you do not need anti depressants when you are in up swing.<br>  <br>  You can stay in sun to treat your depression, you can also exercise regularly. Candida infection can also be helped if you have air and sun.  <br>  <br>  Lifestyle changes can help a lot of diseases. Please be aware of yourself and your environment to check which is making you sick.
c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	I read a really interesting strategy for losing weight in the book Nudge (Thaler and Sunstein) this weekend.<br>  <br>  The two guys competed in losing weight. First, they made this huge bet that if either of them didn't make their target weight (30 pounds in 9 months, I think it was), the loser had to pay the other guy $10,000. <br>  <br>  And then, to maintain the weight, for the next year or so, they could challenge the other to a weigh-in at any time (but only once a week, I think), and if the other guy was over the target weight, he had to pay a penalty to the first guy.<br>  <br>  So, grab yourself a competitive, aggressive diet buddy. (-: And if you can't find one, it might be possible that you don't actually need to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Remember, osteoporosis when you are an old lady is no fun. Take care of your body, and don't abuse it to fit some fashion ideal.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I'm your same size exactly (I'm 5'8'') and I look average, but would like to lose 10 lbs (not happy with my tummy).

Open your legs as wide as your shoulders.<br>  2.) Slightly bend your knees.<br>  3.) Spin your hips in a small circle.<br>  4.) Then make the circle bigger and bigger.<br>  <br>  Do this for 30 seconds ~ 1 minute 5 times a day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Second thing you can try is:<br>  1.) Lie down, bend your knees and stick the legs and feet together and put your feet to your butt.<br>  2.) Move your hips up and down 30 times. Be careful to keep your legs, feet and butt stuck together.<br>  3.) Once you're done moving your hips up and down 30 times, keep your butt up and count to 10.<br>  <br>  <br>  I heard of diets where you can...<br>  <br>  Nibble on something (like bread) when you feel hungry which helps you feel full and you don't have to eat much.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of recipes where you can eat normally but they have low calories. I think there are books about them, or recipes on the internet for them.|`|CVZhrM0Yaa	hi, the best way to lose weight is to make a little diary and take notes of everything you eat each day for a week.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|kZtws4IZaa	exercise at least 2 hours a day<br>  Drink at least 8 cups of water every day<br>  cut junk food including sweets<br>  only east junk food in moderation<br>  dont eat too many carbs<br>  eat many veggies<br>  about 3 fruits a day<br>  don't skip meals like breakfast or lunch, they will just lower your metabolism making it hard for u to lose weight.<br>  Try drinking green tea for breakfast or after diner, Green tea is proven to boost up ur metabolism making it easier and quiker for u to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  u can try exercising daily and eating whatever u like in moderation, but then u have to stop eating past 7pm, and trust me you'll lose a lot of weight, u should only drink green tea or water past 7pm, or eat veggies or fruits past 7pm.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  -Hope I helped!=]|`|h7Z7dxK9aa	Although exercise is the best way, nutrition is the second best thing to lose weight, eat frequently with less amounts. this will help burn off easily and you will not feel hungry more often.<br>  hope that helped!

I'm 25 now and I think about how much I used to hate and think about it back them but now I dont, its just the way you are when you're a teenager, I know pretty girls with big noses, we're just all different and things are made to suit our faces, you might look really weird with a small nose, everything else might look out of place? And apart from that our face's change and grow and things that might of looked bigger when we are teenagers start to fit in better later on, so try not to worry about it, I know its hard, just focus more on the things you think are good about you? like pretty eyes or shiny hair etc? Oh and if those boys say 'you have a big cawk on your head' say 'well you have a little cawk down your pants!'

Staph infections commonly cause skin infections, like boils, but may cause even more serious infections<br>  <br>  Researchers believe that the “staph” bacterium has always coexisted with human beings. Bacteria, like all organisms, change over time to adapt to their environment. So when penicillin and similar antibiotics arrived on the scene for fighting infection, certain strains of the staphylococcus bacteria gradually evolved an immunity to those drugs. The resistant forms first appeared in the 1960s in healthcare settings, and are called healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). Then, around 1990, a new strain of the bacteria, community-associated MRSA (or CA-MRSA), began to affect even healthy people. It is this last type that has been receiving the most attention recently, though healthcare organizations have been aggressively fighting the healthcare-associated variety since it was first noticed.|`|AA11000061	MRSA and other so called SuperBugs like VRE and C.Difficile basically evolved because most people are lazy when it comes to taking and finishing a course of antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Bacteria evolve so fast that over time they become resistant to things that try to kill them, such as antibiotic medicines.  When this happens the resistant strain becomes dominant until you get MRSA et al.  It's basically a case of biological warfare between man and bacteria, kill or be killed and a perfect example of survival of the fittest.<br>  <br>  The bacteria that evolved into MRSA has coexisted with mankind for centuries and for most people does no harm.  In rare cases it can cause throat infections and skin infections.  99% of the time these are nothing that a simple course of antibiotics cures.  It's the 1% of times where someone doesn't complete the course or the bacteria survive and evolve that results in this antibiotic resistance.  MRSA probably first appeared shortly after we first started using penicillin in the early 1900s.<br>  <br>  It doesn't help that society is obsessed with antibiotics and germs right now.  Humans have a fantastic defense against bugs and stuff called our immune response.  Many of todays allergies may well be a result of an over clean lifestyle and the immune system getting bored.<br>  <br>  Dirt is good!!!|`|uiIhQljxaa	Isn't it just a virus that lives in everybodys nostrels etc that transfers through dirty towels etc.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing modern clensliness suddenly helped the virus become immune to hospital cleaning procedures, hence becoming a hospital superbug.<br>  <br>  Still, thats all I know.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis!

DI3u9gMSaa	I had really, really crooked teeth and chose Invisalign.  Invisalign couldn't correct everything so I switched to traditional braces... and love them.  Invisalign is way more comfortable and easier to take care of, but do you want straight teeth or a better appearance?  If your teeth are crooked, you may need buttons, which makes Invisalign not so invisible.  Also, your teeth may need to be filed.  If Invisalign treatment doesn't correct your teeth all the way on the last set of aligners, you will need more.  It's much safer to go with metal.|`|DK3zY3mkaa	i'd go with regular braces, because using invisalign, you have to take them off and put them on, it will be harder to keep both your teeth and the invisalign clean. invisalign is much more expensive than braces, and could probably take longer.<br>  <br>  you should chose braces because you can get different colors every time. braces are like the new fad. if you are really self conscious about getting regular braces, you should get the clear ones, but you have to brush better.<br>  <br>  if your teeth are crooked you should get regular/ clear braces, not invisalign. because invisalign only works for not so crooked teeth, just for minor cases.<br>  <br>  im getting braces tomorrow, clear on top and metal on bottom, because when i smile, its mostly my top teeth showing. it will be less noticeable because its clear on top (:|`|AA10632588	Braces, if I were you.

It calculates for you your daily intake of calorie, fat and sugars allowed for the day. Then all you do is add the food you eat throughout the day into your food plan and it adds all thr food up and  lets you know your remaining intake for the day.<br>  <br>  Once you enter the food diary for the day you will then be told how much weight u will weigh in 5 weeks if u continue to eat in this way.<br>  <br>  If the food you have eaten is not listed on the site, you simply add it in yourself using the nutritional guide printed on the food packet...its easy!!<br>  <br>  I found that logging the food i had eaten throughout the day really helped me at first because i was aware of the high fat and calorie foods.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|KNAXeh9baa	In between 2 weeks and forever.|`|inI1fkx7aa	Depends on male/female, age, height, ideal weight and amount overweight.<br>  <br>  For me, only 5 pounds over now and a 21yr old female?

52049532f067e7f3f342d96d6e190656aa	An early study from Chapel Hill Tubal Reversal Center followed 189 women for 12 to 18 months after reverse tubal surgery. The women in this study group ranged from 25 to 46 years of age and the average age was 34 years. The average time from sterilization to reverse tubal surgery was 8 years (range 1-24 years). The most common reasons stated for requesting reversal were a change in marital status and the desire to have a child with a new partner or husband, a desire for more children with the current partner or husband, death of a child, symptoms related to post tubal syndrome, and other psychological or religious reasons.<br>  <br>  All of the women in this study had had at least 1 year of follow-up after their reverse tubal surgery. Of the 189 women, 122 (65%) had had one or more pregnancies. Term deliveries and ongoing intrauterine pregnancies occurred in 66 (35%) of the patients; miscarriage in 40 (21%), and ectopic pregnancy in 16 (9%) of the patients. 67 (35%) of the study patients who had not yet become pregnant at the time of their follow-up telephone interview.<br>  <br>  The time period from tubaligation to reverse tubal surgery was known for 187 patients (99%). The pregnancy rate was 74% for the group with a time interval of 5 years or less; 63% for the group with a time period of 6-10 years, and 62% for the group with a time period of 11 years or more between sterilization and reversal. These differences were not statistically significant.<br>  <br>  Besides this info my mother in law had her tubligation reversed successfully and had a healthy child after that. I hope this was encouraging to you.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Yes, it is possible. You can have another surgery to get the the tubal ligation reversed. <br>  <br>  I am not sure it is always successful, it depends on the individual and what type of surgery exactly was done originally. But it is definitely possible for a lot of women, a couple of my moms friends had it reversed and had children.

My sister's have waxed all their life since they were teens, and the hair on the armpits, started to slowly grow back from after 6 weeks.

Do not unwind your day in the bed this will only cause your sleep to be delayed and can create an anxiety ruining your entire night.<br>  I never tried this because if I don't take a nap in the afternoon I automatically fall asleep at night.<br>  Also working all day in office does make one tired and goto bed.<br>  However it all depends on the quality of sleep you get.<br>  No nightmares and bad dreams.

X9QOHRLFaa	hi jasmine sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|fcbf59d3765fc40afec4d3523db17ba8aa	Get an exercise bike machine.

AA11864715	I think counselling would help.  It would give you practise and support with the things you find difficult.  "Running away"  like you did will not be a big issue to the counsellor like it is to you.  The counsellor will know that people who go to see them are in some sort of difficulty, or they wouldn't be seeking help in the first place. <br>     Would it be easier if you phoned first to make an appointment or to just break the ice?<br>    You say that you wouldn't know what to say to the counsellor.  They are trained to encourage you to explain your difficulties.  They can ask you questions or  help you to use diagrams, lists, diaries.<br>    Many people have difficulty in social situations.  Some of us (like me, for instance) tend to be shy and quiet with strangers, and dislike small talk.  The important thing is to learn how to enjoy your life better, and managing your social anxiety will help.  No-one expects you to undergo a total personality change.  You may always be shy, but so what so long as you make social contact that you enjoy! <br>    Some people feel more comfortable with people who are not super-confident, and blushing can be quite attractive.  By this I mean that you may not be coming across as badly as you think.<br>  Please try the counsellor again.  You can work with them on what you want to change and how you will do it.|`|jRz7dYaRaa	you're just like me! well...not exactly, i've gotten a little better, and i have my small group of friends. then again i'm a senior in high school and considering that everyone has been together since kindergarten and there is only 200 of us, that's still pretty sad. i'm nervous about college, where i wont know anyone, but then i realized that they wont know me either, so i can start all over with out being labeled as shy. of course i will always be shy, but not to the same extent. unlike your mom, my parents are both in the health care field, and i have been seeing a psychiatrist since i was 6...i have social anxiety disorder, and not that i want to stick you with a diagnosis, but i think you might also (google it) it doesn't have any bad connotations to it, it just means we get really nervous over things that most people do without thinking about. it doesn't mean we can't, it just means it takes a lot more confidence. (i'm on a prescription to help me, an SSRI [google it]) i hope i was slightly helpful, and don't worry there is a whole community of us who are just like you...(although none of us know each other, and most likely never will. but we are there for you)|`|KlkUj6uFaa	You're right, you cannot go on living the rest of you life like that, but for it to change you have to seek help!<br>  <br>  I remember reading an article suggesting that 1 in 4 people will suffer from some sort of mental health issue in their life, so there is no shame in seeking help because many people are going through exactly the same as you are now.<br>  <br>  I suffered from horrific panic attacks and didn't do anything about it for years, and I ended up a nervous wreck with no life. With help from my GP and through CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) I am now back on track and am no long afraid to walk outside the front door. <br>  <br>  I think you could go back to the counsellor at college or book an appointment with your GP. I know your mom might be against it, but hopefully when you start to feel better about yourself, and your mom sees a difference in you her opinion might change. Besides, your mom is not the one who is suffering with these attacks at the moment, you are.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, there is help available, but you have to brave and make the first step.
Neo8z1Dkaa	Masturbation for girls normally starts out as fingering the vagina. this involves inserting your fingers into yourself. The more you masturbate the more you explore yourself and you'll find out what you really like and what works best for you. Try placing your two fingers on your "clitoris" and rubbing back and fourth or in a circular motion. This could potentially cause you to orgasm :)|`|USsDzaIsaa	A dildo is not used to stimulate the clitoris.

AA10988215	My boyfriend is a recovered heroin addict and although I have no personal experience of drug use myself I can let you know what he has told me about getting off heroin.  <br>  <br>  He also recently turned 30 although he has been clean of heroin for about 10 years now.  When he decided to stop he went to his doctor and said that he'd developed an addiction to heroin and that he needed help to stop.  He was put on a program of methadone.<br>  <br>  When he'd decided that he was going to stop he moved out of the flat that he shared with a friend who was also an addict.  Basically he tried to cut off all contact with people who were addicts.  At first they still contacted him, but he told them they had to leave him alone because he had to stop.  He said that despite a few relapses, he managed to stop the heroin completely about 6 months after he started the methadone and cut off all contact with his friends.  He said the withdrawal was awful and the time coming off it was really hard, but that it's the best decision he's ever made for himself.<br>  <br>  He's told me the only way that he managed to stop using was by immediately severing all ties with other users.  I think in your case, having a girlfriend trying to kick the habit too will either be a blessing or a nightmare.  My partner says that in his experience, users who have boy/girlfriends who also use find it hard to stop because if the other one gives in, they do too.  He was never in a relationship during the time he used and says he feels that if he was he probably would not have been able to stop.  However, I suppose in some cases the reverse of this may be true, in that if one partner is successfully giving up the other may be positively influenced by them.  In his experience though, he strongly feels that it was 'going it alone' that worked for him.<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you some things to think about.  I think that immediately you need to get away from the people and places you associate with heroin.  I understand moving house isn't always feasible but I think you're going to find it hard to give it up if you're surrounded by the same things as you have been throughout your addiction.  Once you make the decision to stop just get away from it all and keep away from other addicts as much as you can.  Also get to your doctor for help such as methadone or naltrexone implants etc-they should offer you good support.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is ashamed of himself even to this day about his addiction, but I always tell him how very proud I am that he beat it and proved that he was better than that. I really truly hope that you can do the same and prove that you are better than heroin.  I wish I could give you advice that would make it all easy, but I can't.  You just need to focus on the life you can have without heroin.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your girlfriend, I really hope you can do this.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	need to go to your local drug dependency unit, your Dr can refer you. they will slowly stabilize you on methadone or subutex. from there its will power. you will get a lot of support from the team. good luck xxx|`|WWnkeaIAaa	first off 'never cry wolf' people on stuff like that is a secret, so i don't believe this here or you'd done be in trouble nation wide. i could say more but i gotta give me a break now|`|PK498w0Saa	Most people on this site are against that sort of thing, but fair play to you for deciding it's time to stop. I would highly recommend asking the same question on BlueLight, which is a site specifically designed for that type of question. The most important thing is you need to support each other and be strong enough to say no to going back to your old life even when you are desperate. It won't be easy but it will be even harder if you don't work together. I would say avoid methadone because it's even more addictive than the heroin, which will mean you'll have far more problems. A doctor could point you on a way which you would find helpful. But ask on BlueLight for a better answer. Hope I've helped a little. Do you reckon I could ask you a few questions via email? I'm interested but not involved in the way of life surrounding heroin users and am currently writing about it.<br>  <br>  Happy birthday for yesterday by the way :)|`|zZ6wjO6Maa	Go to your doctor - they have the contacts.|`|1SF3D7Ffaa	it doesn't matter if you look good on the outside. go to rehab if you wanna quit|`|DGCIrUBcaa	I would suggest seeking professional help.

She developed lung metastasis and was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy (a novel treatment at that time). Despite all available treatment, she became emaciated, weighing only about 79 lb by June 1952. Evita died at the age of 33, at 8:25 p.m. on 26 July 1952. The news was immediately broadcast throughout the country, and Argentina went into mourning: all activity in Argentina stopped: movies stopped playing, restaurants were closed and patrons were shown to the door. A radio broadcast interrupted the broadcasting schedule, with the announcer reading, "It is my sad duty to inform you that today at 8:25 p.m. Eva Perón, Spiritual Leader of the Nation, entered immortality".

tE0QbKQYaa	First of all You never mentioned your age but I will try my best to give you as much information as I can on HPV. Second of all I want to let you know I am very proud of you for asking about it because HPV is very very common! Its a fact that about 50-75% of people will have/get HPV at some point in their life. That is how common it is!! So don't be afraid to find out!! <br>  <br>  What is HPV? <br>  HPV is a common virus. There are about 40 types of HPV that affect the genitals or sex organs of men and women. Some HPV types can cause genital warts.  Other types can infect a woman’s cervix and lead to cervical cancer over many years. But most of the time, HPV causes no symptoms or health problems and goes away by itself within two years. Experts do not know why HPV goes away in so many, but not all women. (www.cdc.gov)<br>  <br>  *note:viruses don't go away; example: if someone has HPV they may not have the genital warts but they may have the virus in there body*<br>  <br>  Is there a way to do a blood test? No a blood test can NOT be done to detect HPV.<br>  <br>  Is there a way you can test to see if you have or ever had hpv? YES: You can make an appointment with your doctor to have a pap test done or a HPV test done. The difference between HPV test and Pap smear test:  Both of those tests help screen for cervical cancer, but they look for different things. The Pap test looks for cell changes on your cervix that could develop into cervical cancer.  The HPV test looks for HPV, the virus that can cause these cell changes.(cdc.gov).<br>  <br>  A lesion in the cervix:  During a pap smear some cells are scraped or brushed off the cervix, (then what happens is the doctor sends it to the lab and the lab will then put it  on a slide that can be examined under a microscope.) The purpose of the Pap test is to detect changes that may lead to cervical cancer long before the cancer develops. On the slide that they examine may find "lesions" which are from the cervix there are "low grade lesions" and  "high grade lesions". Low grade leasions RARELY form into cervical cancer where as High grade lesions" are more likey to form into cervical cancer. <br>  <br>  Can a man be tested? No there is no HPV test for a male therefore a male cannot be tested! <br>  <br>  *note: Its very important for sexual active women to get a pap smear every year* not only to check for HPV but there other Sexually Transmitted Infections that can occurr that you may not know u have. For example: Chlamedia there are a lot of women that don't know they have it but they go in for a pap smear and they find out they have it. Being sexually active comes the responsibility of taking care of your health!! I know its hard to go to doctor and strip down and spread your legs and have them be looking inside your vagina. (I am a female so I understand how u feel- I dread my yearly exams but I still drag my butt there.) :-)    To help you feel more comfortable going 1. Pick someone whom u feel more comfortable with (example: if you perfer a woman to do it then go to a woman doctor if u dont want some woman doing it then go to a male) 2. Go to public health that is why we have public health (they are there to help with these kinds of things more so then just a regular family doctor) 3. Think of it as your not the only one going in there. A lot of women & men go in there for testing (so your not alone- if u do have something be thankful they found it early) 4. keep in mind that this is your health and you will do just fine going in there. The first time is always the hardest but u took the first step and that is to get information. pap smears don't hurt its just uncomfortable because your naked and having someone looking inside your vagina. But just look at the bright side its only ONCE a year (unless something is wrong then u may have to go more). I know u can do it so just relax!!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you out! If you have any more questions feel free and ask!!|`|USsDzaIsaa	The way to test if you have HPV is via a pap smear.<br>  <br>  You can have an antigen test that detects HPV but that requires that a swab be taken of your cervix.  If you're going to do that, then you may as well have a smear done.<br>  <br>  BTW: if you don't have a pap smear and you develop cervical cancer the procedures that follow are far more invasive than a smear.

inI1fkx7aa	Carbohydrates, fat and protein are the three basic "blocks" that make up the food we eat.  When your body processes these foods, it creates energy, which we measure in "calories" (in terms of human energy).  Carbs, fat and protein will give you different amounts of calories per gram, and will also cause you to gain weight differently.<br>  <br>  To maintain a steady weight, you have to burn as many "calories" as you eat.  To lose, you eat fewer calories then you burn.  To gain, you eat more than you burn.  Humans (and animals) burn calories just by living and there are sites that can guess at how many calories you burn a day just living your normal life.  After that, it's up to you to either cut back or burn away the extra to maintain (or lose) weight.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Carbs and Cals are different...<br>  <br>  Go have a read of some of the good reputable diet/nutrition websites and to get a better understanding of your food. The one I like is called Calorie King it is Australian so wont have American foods on it and its in metric too.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.calorieking.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieking.com.au/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/</a>|`|AA10834046	Carbs and calories are not the same.  All food falls into three categories.  Protein, Fat and Carbohydrates.  <br>  <br>  Every gram of Fat has 9 calories.  Every gram of Carbohydrates or Protein has 4 calories.  In other words, fat has more than twice the calories of other foods per gram.  <br>  <br>  When you look at food labels you can see total calories.  It may also show total calories from fat as a separate number.  In the end, it is calories that make the difference.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to lose weight you should avoid low quality carbs as well as high fat foods.|`|ipL7L5WSaa	At the end of the day. the only thing that matters is calories. Eat as many carbs as you want, but just keep your calories in the right range. After having kids, your metabolism slows a bit, so you'll have to work out if you want to lose weight. Most women eat about 1300 to 1600 calories to lose weight.

6452853bbe6f3e53f6fcae5d1f5ebb50aa	Congrats on starting an exercise regime.  First off, if you haven't worked out in a while, you will want to start out fairly slow and work your way up.  2-3 lbs a week is definitely achievable and probably a little more in the beginning. For people just starting out, 3 workouts per week is sufficient.  When people take on more than their body is prepared, they frequently overtrain, which actually leads to diminished results as well as burnout.  So a simple Monday Wednesday Friday full body routine is all you should be doing in the beginning stages.  30 minutes of cardio followed by core strength training that focuses on the large muscle groups.  There is no need for isolation exercises at this point.  Make sure you work the largest muscles first, followed by the smaller ones.  For example:<br>  <br>  Chest press-                3 sets/ 10-12 reps<br>  Back (Lat pull down) -   3 sets/ 10-12 reps<br>  Shoulders press  -             same<br>  Triceps kick backs -          same<br>  Biceps curls   -                 same<br>  Legs press or squats-        same<br>  Abs  crunches   -          3 sets/ 20 reps<br>  <br>  Some things you want to observe is that you want to change up the exercises fairly frequently, perhaps every few weeks or so, because the body adapts to the same exercise, so you need to "shock" it so to speak and work each muscle from different angles to avoid a plateau from occurring. Also you want to make sure you give your body at least a days rest (sometimes more) in between workouts to allow for sufficient recovery.  Muscle is gained through REST and proper nutrition, not from the workout itself.<br>  <br>  Now speaking of nutrition, this is 70% of the game.  Diet is the most important factor when building muscle and losing weight.  The ideal "diet" and mind you this is not really a diet in the traditional sense, but a way of eating.  The best way is to eat 5 -6 smalls meals a day that are balanced with protein, carbs and some fat.  It's imperative as you begin to progress, that you ingest some form of protein every 4 -6 hours or your body will actually enter catabolic state in which it starts feeding off your own muscle tissue.  This is not a huge factor the first few months or so, but it's best to get into the practice of ingesting some form of protein frequently if you expect to continue to see results.  Also keep in mind.  No matter how many crunches, sit ups or other ab exercises you do, you will not see a six pack without proper diet.  Abs are created in the kitchen, not in the gym.<br>  Now as far as supplements are concerned, the most you need is a good daily vitamin, and some protein powder (whey) if you don't have enough time to make natural food every meal, which most of us don't.  Do not buy into all the different and expensive supplements out there.  They are NOT needed at all.  As long as you stay consistent with both your workouts, and diet, you will see amazing results.  Good luck to you.|`|inI1fkx7aa	Well, going off my boyfriend's example (5'11", went from 250-230 in 2 months and then from 220-200 in 3.5), you COULD lose up to 25 pounds in twelve weeks.  It does depend on how "fat" (over ideal) you are.  The more overweight you are, the easier it is to start burning.  The closer you come to your body's ideal, the longer and more it will take.<br>  <br>  I'd think 2lbs a week is a bit ambitious, but worth aiming for.  I'd think 15-20 pounds loss overall would be most likely.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you put on muscle, you'll be adding back some weight so you might lose 20 pounds of fat and gain 5-10 in muscle.|`|ipL7L5WSaa	Make sure your eating about 2000 to 2500 calories a day. And always remember to work out. The cardio sounds good, but make sure it is for at least an hour a day. Two pounds a week sounds right, and if you lift weights you would definitely be toned. Good luck!|`|r1QLeM9yaa	12 weeks... umm im not totally sure, but I would say that you could, if you really tried, lose 30lbs in the 12 weeks. it will be a hard thing to achieve, but you could be able to do it!  btw do interval training on a running machine for amazing weight loss results. gd luck

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|E2kx5kwjaa	For many who have successfully lost weight will tell you that not only its is important to watch what you eat, but the weight loss effort will be half a success if you do not include a regular or routine exercise programme.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|inI1fkx7aa	Do some kind of group thing.  Whether it's a summer soccer team, a walking/jogging club or a class, working out with other people is ALWAYS more fun.<br>  <br>  Do you have a dog?  Take him/her for walks.  Maybe offer to take the neighbours if you don't, or even just walk along with them.  A dog ALWAYS appreciates a good walk, and being loved on by one is fun.<br>  <br>  Is there an active thing you've always wanted to try but never have?  Now's the time!  Horseback riding is great... trotting a horse is the same as a combination walk/jog and galloping is the same as a full-out jog.  You can often trade stable work for reduce fees on your ride... and burn more calories doing so!  Rock climbing, kayaking, and hiking are all something you can find if you have a nearby state park and can be done for relatively cheap.<br>  <br>  If you live near water, swimming is one of the best ways to burn calories easily while having fun.  Go to the beach with friends and spend as much time in the water as tanning and it'll do more than you'd think!|`|ipL7L5WSaa	Walking around your neighborhood with a friend is very affective and fun. I have been walking 1 mile every afternoon for about 30 minutes with my mom, and I've lost 20 pounds. Very energizing after a long day, and can clear your mind. If you're going solo, put on some earphones with a fast beated song so you don't slow down. Trust me, I love to walk now. If you live in a warm climate, try hiking or a nature walk.

One of the most common forms of eczema is atopic dermatitis (or "atopic eczema"). Approximately 10 percent to 20 percent of the world population is affected by this chronic, relapsing, and very itchy rash at some point during childhood. Fortunately, many children with eczema find that the disease clears and often disappears with age.<br>  <br>  In general, atopic dermatitis will come and go, often based on external factors. Although its cause is unknown, the condition appears to be an abnormal response of the body’s immune system. In people with eczema, the inflammatory response to irritating substances overacts, causing itching and scratching. Eczema is not contagious and, like many diseases, currently cannot be cured. However, for most patients the condition may be managed well with treatment and avoidance of triggers.|`|thHMIIyCaa	Dermatitis is generally when your skin is irritated, swollen, red etc (think of dermatologists) where as eczema is a skin condition|`|NFvZDiNSaa	dermatitis comes into contact with the disease. and eczema can sometimes come into contact with disease. dermatitis means you are allergic to a substance and eczema means you are stressed or something like that! :D xxx|`|za9b8cHKaa	Dermatitis is an allergic reaction and can happen to anyone who is exposed to an irritant.

If you are prone to UTIs, take 1 cranberry capsule daily indefinitely and get your blood sugar checked to make sure you're not diabetic.<br>  <br>  Golden seal is not recommended in pregnancy. If you are or think you might be, substitute Grapefruit seed extract or colloidal silver.|`|BRXg8Mcpaa	The purest cranberry extract you can find.  Cranberry contains a sugar compound called D-Mannose which the bacteria in a UTI feed off of.  Don't be confused with thinking that cranberry juice off the shelf will do the same thing.  It won't.  Often those juices contain way too much sugar and actually just exacerbate the problem.  Try a formula by Gaia Herbs or Jarrow Formulas.  You should see a total turnaround within 24 hours.

There is really nothing that can be done about this. <br>  The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth<br>  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base<br>  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early<br>  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with<br>  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time<br>  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect<br>  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is<br>  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your<br>  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment<br>  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should<br>  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature. <br>  But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical<br>  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not<br>  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall<br>  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the<br>  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone<br>  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!<br>  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height<br>  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth<br>  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.<br>  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the<br>  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or<br>  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,<br>  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never<br>  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and<br>  be happy as you are.
4HQxLXQCaa	I'm not sure how many pounds of fat translate to 3 inches, but I think it is achievable. in time for summer.  Fyi, it's okay to have a busy lifestyle but it's absolutely positively NOT an excuse to blow off exercise or proper nutrition.  Barack Obama is the president of the United States and even he finds time every day to exercise.<br>  <br>  To lose fat:<br>  1. DON’T BELIEVE THOSE FAD DIETS!  DIET PILLS ARE GIMMICKS! Yes, Acai berries/pills/juice is a fad diet.<br>  2. DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!  Unless you are tiny as it is, a 1,200 calorie a day diet is DANGEROUS and won't work in the long run.<br>  3. Find the ammount of calories you need to eat per day to maintain your weight.  Try this link: <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequire.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequi...</a><br>  4. Eat healthy and eat about 500 calories below that number.  Eating too little will result in loss of water weight and muscle mass, not fat (what you actually want to lose).<br>  5. Eat 5-6 small meals a day.  This keeps your metabolism up.  Each meal should include fruits, veggies, water, and protein.  Oatmeal is great for breakfast.<br>  5. Drink at least 64oz (8 8oz glasses) of water a day.  No soda (that includes diet soda).<br>  6. Do light/moderate cardio 3 to 5 times a week for 30 to 45 minutes each time.  Running, bicycling, and swimming are great for this.  If you are obese, do low impact stuff like walking or swimming.<br>  7. Do some strength training to make sure you lose fat and not muscle.  Don't worry; you won't look like the hulk if you lift weights.<br>  8. You should lose about 1-2lbs (.45-.9kg) per week.  If you lose more than that, chances are the rest is stool, water weight, or even muscle mass.<br>  Be patient and be smart.  If you follow this guideline you will be very happy with your results.  Good luck!|`|RMmh0aimaa	Eat smaller meal portions. If you can eat more often to speed up your metabolism. Eat lots of berries/fiber so you go to the toilet regularly.<br>  <br>  Exercise more.

This will happen to you for another few years even without looking at porn <br>  All young guys in puberty have frequent erections and often without any stimulus it is just part of growing up . , At you age I would suggest not to visit porn sites as they give you a false view on sex , and the human body . However I do recommend that you look on a search engine for "puberty boys" you may think you know what is happening to your body but these sites will give you lots of reassurance that you are just like all other guys your age|`|LV8uUmehaa	Hi James.<br>  <br>  It's very usual and is a process of growing-up (Puberty). This is how it will begin, and we name this process "random erections". The next step is most likely going to be "frequent erections". This is when you will get erections very frequently.<br>  <br>  You may be starting to see arm-pit hair, belly hair, penis pubic hair etc. All is normal, and if your friends are not going through it at this time you are not abnormal, you are just a more 'advanced' guy, shall we call it. Talk to your friends about it (close friends) and have a talk with them ; its what I do.|`|nA1g26y0aa	Hey, James! You are experiencing the joy of becoming a man! If you want to keep your potential embarrassment of having a hard on in public, I would suggest that you get your parents to buy pants for you that are a little looser than you might be wearing now (not baggy pants that would make you look like a gang-banger) but just a little larger. Then, if you're not already wearing briefs, change your style of underwear. Wearing briefs will not only give you the support that you need, it will also help to "control" the bulge in y our pants from your erection. I would also suggest that you buy a size that is at the lower range of your waist size. Keeping your briefs tight will help with this concern. Don't worry about possible reduction of sperm. Many studies have been done about the briefs vs. boxers and sperm count. Most of the results were insignificant.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	welcome to puberty !|`|2f26838b56bf3bf335cfd0076639a2dcaa	Because your horny|`|h7W5jytOaa	ewwwwwwwwwww redtubeeeeee! how can people doo thatt<br>  && you get hornyy over it lol|`|WrDGhduxaa	At your age with rising hormone levels you are going to be experiencing more and more often erections.<br>  It is something that is going to happen and there isn't much you can do about it except to wear loose clothing so it doesn't show as much in public.|`|3qenINMHaa	your boyfriend is slipping viagra into your hot chocolate

Proper oral hygiene is to brush and floss the teeth and then clean the top of the tongue because the tongue produces up to 90% of your bad breath.

33sD8tstaa	Well, Tylenol is deadly when you put too much in you at once, so is advil.<br>  <br>  Here is a Wiki article about Tylenol Toxicity:<br>  Paracetamol toxicity is caused by excessive use or overdose of the analgesic drug paracetamol (called acetaminophen in the United States). Mainly causing liver injury, paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.<br>  <br>  Many individuals with paracetamol toxicity may have no symptoms at all in the first 24 hours following overdose. Others may initially have nonspecific complaints such as vague abdominal pain and nausea. With progressive disease, signs of liver failure may develop; these include low blood sugar, low blood pH, easy bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. Some will spontaneously resolve, although untreated cases may result in death.<br>  <br>  A liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. Patients treated early have a good prognosis while patients who develop major liver abnormalities typically have a poor outcome. Efforts to prevent paracetamol overdose include limiting individual sales of the drug and combining paracetamol with methionine, which is converted into glutathione in the liver.|`|WNhjMJ2laa	your options.<br>  <br>  1.

When you don't wear glasses to correct your vision you have to squint and strain your eyes to see things, which is worse for your eyes in the end.  Not wearing glasses when you need to will only increase your prescription faster.  You can request for your prescription to be lowered maybe by a quarter or so, so that they are not too strong but either way you should wear your glasses if you are having difficulties seeing distant objects.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	no, the glasses have absolutely nothing to do with it.

rMP9BCyGaa	<a href="http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  With us having an annual 'Stop Smoking' day in the uk there is always a lot of emphasis in March about it which is probably the reason behind you thinking you 'ought' to stop.  It's March 11th this year.<br>  <br>  As a smoker myself I understand how you feel about stopping & have also stopped in the past only to take it up again. <br>  As for cutting down first....this method works for some people but not for others but if you intend to go 'cold turkey' this might be the right way for you as you might find it easier to lessen the amount of nicotine you take in first before cutting it out completely. The only problem with this course of action is the serious temptation to go over your daily allowance of ciggies.<br>  I have stopped 'tailor-made' ciggies today but am still smoking handrolling and so far so good. Up to yesterday I was smoking around 10-15 tailor made cigs then going onto the handrolling. <br>  You could, in effect, take in less nicotine smoking handrolling depending on how thick you roll them. I roll mine thinly so only take between 0.6 & 0.7mg of nicotine each rolly which is a lot less than you'd get from the inhalator.<br>  If you have asthma or have had it in the past I would suggest you see your GP before stopping because it could affect your asthma or you could end up with it back again through stopping as the toxins leave your body etc. My eldest daughter stopped a week ago & she has had to go back on asthma medication. She's not had any problems with asthma since she was a child but she stops smoking & it comes back!<br>  Everyone is different & stopping is personal to you, what works for some might not work for others so I'd advice taking a look at the link plus see your GP first.<br>  Maybe this time next year we can both say we are now Non Smokers....or at least you can! lol<br>  Good luck with whichever method you use to quit.|`|177a62d2ca9b3f3b8c0b389e966f08c7aa	my nan used to smoke and she wanted to stop this was b4 the patches basically she replaced cigarettes with chewing gum basically the chewing gum is and alternative to the cigarettes hope this helps :D|`|9gCWOn26aa	When I quit smoking i managed to cut down for quite a while to around 5 a day, it is probably more difficult when you are smoking more i would have thought. I used gum myself, even though it makes you feel temporarily poisoned and gross, though it was quite helpful to just chew 2 a day to distract my brain from wanting cigarettes. Anything you can do to distract yourself really, everytime i needed a cigarette i had a cup of tea or some mints which helped, also carrying round a bottle of water gives you something to do and flushes out your system. At the end of the day it is about willpower, mind over matter basically, and they do say matter isn't real anyway :-) I just kept reminding myself that i had worked this hard to get this far, having a cigarette would ruin all my hard work for sure.<br>  If you are going cold turkey, try some hypnotherapy or EFT/NLP, they are very good for reprogramming almost your thought patterns into not wanting to smoke. There are some good EFT videos on youtube for free if that helps, it can be expensive sometimes to go to these things! Also some practicioners hold workshops for little money to encourage people to give up smoking which i found very useful :-)<br>  Good luck!|`|vhuzsMPsaa	I quit a good while ago.  I tried and was successful for a year.  Then I had one puff, and knew it was too powerful for me.  When I finally successfully quit I had really prepared for it.  I read what I could about it.  But I was also broke.  I said to myself, let there be a silver lining in being this poor.  The silver lining was that I was unable to afford food and cigarettes. I chose to eat.  <br>  Would you support yourself by making cigarettes?  Do you think that it's immoral to profit when so many are killed or diseased by them?  Are you a bad influence on those younger who see you smoking?  I saw things that way before I quit.<br>  Good luck.|`|5UaVp256aa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting.

If it feels like cramping you could very well be constipated and it feels like cramping because your body is trying to help push the waste out. I know it sounds gross but it is very normal. If you are able to get a laxative or an enema that could help a lot. If you aren't able to have any of those then try taking a warm bath and le your stomach soak in the hot water.<br>  <br>  Try eating more vegetables and drinking more water..Good luck
HXpR2bw0aa	I can't really tell because your jacket is in the way, but if you really feel like you wanna lose weight then follow these tips!<br>  <br>  Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|1LB7NBhcaa	no your buxom and have a nice bum and tobe honest its a shame that you think your fat your next uestion should be would you prefer to be with me or skinny v beckam i bet youll besurprised what most men will pick if it comes to the push as believe it or not most fellas will go for you so stop worring and enjoy yourself|`|B3cPFhssaa	You're not fat,it's just because you're quite short - i don't mean any offence either,i'd love to be your height.<br>  You look perfectly fine to me from what i can see.|`|XGgJR8TVaa	Take a pic with your top oof :P<br>  Will be able to tell better.|`|K75OmKHzaa	That is not fat AT ALL whatsoever!

ZG6DeAzPaa	I hate doing this, but I end up having to do it 10+ times a year because my schedule shifts. <br>  <br>  You either have to stay up all day/night or sleep for like 15 hours. If you have nothing to do... and think you can sleep that long. That one is much easier. If you are going to stay up, it can be helpful to eat like your schedule is already fixed. So for you....Eat breakfast at 6am.. and dinner at 6pm. <br>  <br>  If you have trouble staying up... do not do it with caffeine... It wont work and you'll feel terrible. Just stay out of the bed, and keep busy. I have heard that if you don't eat it can make you stay awake because hungry animals shouldn't go to sleep, they should keep hunting. I have never had the willpower not to eat, cause I loves me some food. :P<br>  <br>  The main problem I run into with this is waking up at 2AM and not being able to fall asleep. I just stay up a little bit later every day... and go to sleep a little later every day. Eventually you can get it where you want it. Hope this helps.|`|G80du9O8aa	you stay up for a whole 'day', then go to sleep that night at the right time. use an alarm clock for the first few nights, then try to wake yourself up at the right time.|`|67ZoPOrMaa	If you really want to change your schedule , you got to start  from tomorrow don't sleep during the day , no matter how much you need the sleep... and from tomorrow  go to sleep at 9 pm

bjqjkDMHaa	autism is not something that you should mimic.  It's a neurological disorder characterized by....how about I give you an article I wrote on autism?<br>  .................<br>   Autism Spectrum Disorders Most people will think of a silent, stony-faced child who sits in a corner, rocking and is completely unresponsive. This is the sad truth for a minute portion of the Autistic population, but most are nowhere nearly so severe. The most important thing you can learn about Autism is that it's a SPECTRUM DISORDER. That means it's like the difference between black and white--white being a normal person, and black being a very severely autistic person. There are many, many, many shades of gray in between the black and the white. I am in the pale gray. I have Asperger's Syndrome. The whole set of symptoms portrayed by people with ASD's (in any range of severity) are: Fixation: this means that they are basically prone to obsession, eg, they become obsessed easily, and tend to stay with that obsession for a long time. Usually a positive one, although that doesn't mean their family and friends won't go crazy from hearing them talk about it ALL THE TIME. This is called perseveration. Delayed Social Skills: they display difficulty fitting into a social structure; they often have trouble in conversation, and may talk about a narrow range of things. likely their perseveration is a favorite subject. Poor Language or even non-existent language: this means they may not speak at all, or are nonverbal. Most, however, do speak, at least a little. All three criterion must be met for a patient to be diagnosed with Autism. Those who fall in two of the categories will likely be classified as having Asperger's Syndrome--which I have. My nine-year-old bother is mildly Autistic. This is why I included this condition. I never do hear the end of his rants about WWII...(that's his perseveration, lucky me, I like history, though.) Contrary to popular belief, minutely few, autistic people are savants, although they may have extensive knowledge on the subject of their perseveration. Very few have such an extraordinary gift like those who are shown in the media.<br>  <br>  Along with ASD's may come sensory issues. You may have no idea what that means. I can tell, you, though. Sensory issues make everyday, normally inoffensive stimuli almost unbearable. My worst sensory issues would be sound. A sniffle, snort, sneeze, clearing of the throat, etc, will trigger an instant rage reaction. Sensory issues are a real challenge in my day-to-day life. <br>  ...............<br>  People sometimes are born with an amazing gift like the rain man's.  It is possible to teach yourself to do just about anything, but it would take hours and hours and years of work.   Some people just have a gift, and that is all.  Although some savants have literally taught themselves to do what they do.  Although the thing is, their skills are pretty obscure and most can't get jobs using their talent.|`|wwdllMzYaa	no<br>  sorry, <br>  its a brain function<br>  you cant change your brain<br>  <br>  al you can do is be the best YOU can be<br>  not be the bst soemone else can be
AG9msdUDaa	Usually this is a sign of a food allergy. If this goes on long enough you can gain 'false fat' which is general puffiness in your tissues that looks like fat but is just inflammation. It can also lead to chronic ailments down the road if not treated, like diabetes, cancer, arthritis, immune suppression etc.<br>  <br>  You can try an elimination/reintroduction diet and see if your blood tests improve. This is not easy, but is well worth it to spare you a life time of suffering. The top food allergens are: gluten, sugar, dairy, eggs, nuts, soy and corn. You can remove all of these for three months, then introduce one at a time back into your diet. Do it for three days at first and make sure to keep a journal during that time to make notes of any discomfort you feel in your body or skin issues like rashes or acne flare ups etc. If nothing happens, then you know you are not allergic to that food. Then reintroduce another food and do the same thing until you've narrowed down what it is that you are allergic to.<br>  <br>  You can also just ask for an allergy test but they are very inaccurate and it can really depend on how long ago you ate the allergen and how much you ate. You can often get false negatives.<br>  <br>  Also, if after you have removed all those foods listed above and you still get the inflammatory markers in your blood, you may need to go even more extreme. The next step is to remove all processed (and that includes restaurant) food which is anything in a bag box or can.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't do it, you may as well just go to a raw vegan organic diet for a few months. This is the best known diet for humans anyway, but I would still include meat (as long as it is organic) maybe once a month personally, because there are benefits from eating meat as well. But this diet will give you all the nutrients you need, except B12 if you go really strict, but then you just have to remember to supplement.|`|ztMeGHY0aa	They are probably being careful so many people sue if they miss something so they are really vigilant. If there was a real problem they would have called you in. Just be glad they are keeping an eye open and ask next time if/when you go back to the hospital for a check|`|rIzx4OEWaa	The most common reason for checking blood cells is that they show how affective treatments are for you (ie the medication you are taking)<br>  Inflammation can show many symptoms from early heart disease to arthritis an many others problems. My guess is your doctor has been testing for each one to rule them out an I would have thought he would have checked your heart first so don't panic. If he was at all worried he would have had you checked into hospital long ago. Even a higher count of red cells can cause slight problems which could be down to your body making to much iron.  Why don't you get a second opinion from another doctor or go to your local hospital for some help. <br>  Alternately ask your computer the same question on the google web site an see what comes up, it will show you reports from other doctors<br>  who have had similar cases to look at. What have you to loose.|`|yev2iWgWaa	definitely there must be site of inflammation.dormant. you can have blood culture and sensitivity and show doctor to give proper antibiotics.full body scan will show place affected.cervical pap smear also can be taken. complete haemogram also will open information

iAv9P3HTaa	As far as medications go it might take some time to find the right one with less side effects but they do work.<br>  <br>  Use these simple steps over and over again until you become the master of your thoughts and emotions.You create your panic attacks not your environment .<br>  Take full responsibility.<br>  <br>  I was suffering from panic attacks for 14 years.<br>  I did a lots of research and reading on the subject.<br>  <br>  Here is a six-step approach to self-control when dealing with an  anxiety attack:<br>  <br>  1.ACCEPT--Recognize that you are feeling anxious.Accept your body feelings as a symptom of your anxiety and a sign that something is bothering you.<br>  <br>  2.PERMISSION--Give yourself permission to feel anxious about whatever it is that is bothering you."Of course I feel anxious because.... and it is okay to have anxiety.I know what this is and why I feel this way."<br>  <br>  3.BREATHE-- First, inhale through your nose slowly for two-seconds,mentally counting one, one-thousand, two ,one- thousand.then exhale through your mouth to mental count of four-second-again by one-thousands.Do this for at least 60-seconds.<br>  <br>  4.INNER DIALOGUE--Use truthful, positive dialogue to talk yourself through  the anxious time.It WILL pass. Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid or fight .<br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!<br>  <br>  Praise to Lucinda Bassett !|`|J4BxsLSXaa	My advice would be to visit a psychologist and I bet u have anxiety and I heared that anti depressants are really bad unless a doctor knows it so gd luck :)))|`|5O0HnfQaaa	anti depresents can work if there is an underlying problem. i take lorazepam but my doctor waited til i was really bad to give it to me.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	What you need is an anxiolytic...|`|ToILKl6waa	I wouldn't resort to anti depressants. Natural remedies would permanently cure you. You have to learn to relax when you feel panic. Anxiety is prevalent around the world - thus, you're certainly not alone. For your body, it's a normal reaction to stress. I would be worried if you DIDN'T get a physical response from stress! Learn to believe and accept that. <br>  <br>  First of all, limit the things that are causing you stress. If a late assignment contributes to the stress, do it. If it's a situation you can't avoid, keep confronting the situation and the anxiety will lessen. Feel the fear and do what you have to do anyway. Let the anxiety do its course. When you start to feel anxious, instead of opposing to the negative thoughts and thinking, "OH NO! GO AWAY PANIC," welcome and encourage the anxiety. Science proves that if you do so, the anxiety will not mount. Drink a bit of water and take a deep breath. Try to stay in touch with the nature around you and away from panicky thoughts. Panic is just a feeling. It does not define who you are.

He sounds like a pain in the a-s-s...|`|85vDqn6naa	Well coming from a fellow bipolar, give him time he will swing back again.|`|AA10148408	bipolars often blame others for their inability to read people when they are manic or depressed (in a vulnerable state) because it is hard to deal with being taken advantage of.  just let him have some space and then he'll see, you were the one on his side.  also, he could be suffering from depression (what goes up must come down) so he will be in isolation a few days.  all you can do is be loving and supportive.|`|ib3SNK40aa	Get out of the situation.

This kind of thing will happen more and if you start to become okay with this it will happen more often.|`|ZFCJgDiTaa	I'm not sure, but he probably thought that you could of stopped his mate from taking his money or that you should of told him sooner.

It's aways, always tough being with anyone with any kind of depression. <br>  I wish I could help but I don't really know anything about your relationship or much about bipolar either.<br>  You just have to be strong and try to understand that some of the stuff he says is not his fault, however horrible it feels and however much you don't want a boyfriend like that.<br>  I'm assuming he's getting treatment? You just really need to be there for him. Hopefully one day he will understand how good you have been for him and how hard it has been for you, and maybe he'll make it up to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. DONT LISTEN TO ALL THE ASSHOLES THAT SAY LEAVE HIM.

It is all down to your skin.... my mother had really terrible stretchmarks and I didn't get any.  <br>  <br>  I did use Clarins Body Tonic oil daily!  But I really don't think it makes any difference what you do - if you are going to get them, you are going to get them.<br>  <br>  My midwife said I had incredibly strong stomach muscles (and I am not a dancer of any kind!), but it is down to your skin, not muscles.|`|M0PW6LZTaa	sure they do, although everyone can get them even men, not just women in pregnancy but lots of young girls in adolescence too.<br>  Creams can all play a part in keeping the skin moist and supple and I would use them, just as I have in the past for my two kids. I have hardly any.|`|cb2NxPERaa	Yes, we all have the same anatomy to a certain degree. Plus, the stretch marks are caused by pregnancy overall.|`|5952f70265bb3d13086af2ee667d60abaa	Your profession has nothing to do with whether or not you will get stretch marks.  First and foremost, heredity plays the biggest part.  Did your mom get stretch marks, how elastic is your skin.  Second, if you gain way more than is normal for a pregnancy, you have a much higher chance of developing stretch marks.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	duh any one can just put some lotion on you stomach daily 2 times a day especially towards the last months and you wond get them cocoa butter|`|1eUSlj11aa	it depends on your body honestly!  I have a friend who dances and she didnt get any!!!! But then one of her friends(who also dances had them bad and had little weight gain!) had them bad!!|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Sorry to say it still gives no immunity, though exercise does help to reduce the problem.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Yes, dancers still have the same anatomy as the rest of us. Stretch marks are not caused by weak muscles, they are caused by a break down or damage to the collagen under the skin. No one is really immune. <br>  <br>  Collagen is a protein that supports the cells, organs, tissues and bone structures. 70% of healthy skin is collagen. If the fibres of collagen get damaged or when collagen production decreases as you get older this causes slackness, lines and wrinkles. <br>   <br>  During pregnancy, certain hormones make the collagen around the abdomen softer to prepare the body for the birthing process. These hormones also affect the collagen found in the skin. As the skin collagen becomes weaker, stretch marks form as the body grows to accommodate the baby. Stretch marks are also common during weight loss and weight gain.

By shaving your head you will remove the only means of retaining your natural oils. <br>  I know this because I never had dandruff until I started getting burr haircuts.<br>  You could try using Nisoral shampoo for dandruff.

LajVgGeAaa	I understand how you could feel angry about him not telling you. But you need to know, he did so probably to protect you, in his mind. Perhaps you do not handle bad news too well... And he maybe thought it would be best to not tell you. Do not hate him. But I know you don't really "hate" him, it seems you are just taking your anger out in that way when really the hate is for the cancer, and maybe life in general. It doesn't seem fair to you, and that is a legit view dealing with your circumstances. Advice for you, from me.. would be to forget about the future, and focus on the now. The time you still have left with your dad... let him know how you feel about him, that you love him, and everything else you would want him to know. <br>  <br>  You asked if you should confront him.. My answer to that would be no, don't "confront" him, but talk to him. And let him know in a kind way, that you know. Do not let your angry feelings for the cancer come out towards him. <br>  <br>  Lastly, it is ok and understandable to feel what you are feeling now. But understand, those angry feelings will only hold you back from doing what it is you really want to do inside your heart. Acceptance is important in this situation. And to be aware that these are just the cards that have been dealt to you and your family. Every one has a battle to go through, and this is yours. But, know that you will get through it, and your dad will always be with you. Take care of yourself, everything will be ok.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Hey..

Maybe talk to your sister, about convincing your dad to tell you, or go up to your dad and say, is there something you need to tell me?<br>  He's most likely not telling you, as he dosent want to hurt you.<br>  Try to spend as much time with him as possible.<br>  <br>  Im sorry, and wish you the best of luck.<br>  xx|`|PztDZBW1aa	my dad has cancer too :( but thankfully it isn't terminal as far as we know. i think the best thing you can do is talk to your dad. let him know how you are feeling and be as close to him as you can. he probably didn't tell you because he didn't want to hurt you. the worst thing you can do is keep everything bottled up inside because it will just get worse with time. talk to people about how you are feeling, it will make things easier to deal with if you feel less alone. i am really sorry this has happened to you. don't forget to take care of yourself as well. x x|`|a8687a650a19834bc4b30491b67daa9baa	Well, there's certainly no harm in seeing him. I mean, you should, given the circumstances. I don't know if it's necessary, though, to bring up the cancer at all. Can't you just go see him, and let him know the things you would want him to know, anyway? Of course he will probably suspect that you know when you're saying things like that. But so what. You have nothing to lose by telling him.|`|qv493CGiaa	I'm really sorry to hear about your mum and dad. You should tell him you know the cancer is terminal. Otherwise you'll regret it and will be thinking for the rest of your life what if, what if what if. You shouldn't hate your dad. Not at a time like this. Support him and let him know your there for him. <br>  Good luck for the future hun, i really feel for you, losing one parent is bad enough but i couldn't even imagine the pain of losing both. x|`|B6vn5Mmbaa	Talk to your dad

IKakoOfyaa	Western blot is less sensitive but more specific, that is, one that has a lower rate of producing a false-positive result.  It is used to confirm a positive ELISA.<br>  <br>  In a recent study of the ELISA's reliability and accuracy, it was found to have a "sensitivity" of 99.7%. Sensitivity refers to the rate of false negative results: in the case of the ELISA, this means that 99.7% of test samples were correctly diagnosed as positive when antibodies were present, and that 0.3% of test samples--or 3 in 1,000--were falsely diagnosed by the ELISA as negative when HIV antibodies were actually present. The test's "specificity" was 98.5%. <br>  Specificity refers to the rate of false positive results: in the case of the <br>  ELISA, this means that 98.5% of negative test samples were correctly diagnosed as negative, and that 1.5% of the test produced positive results when antibodies were not present.|`|396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	Elisa is the test that is used first when testing blood.  If it is positive then the blood is tested with western blot.  They are used to offset any inaccuracies in the other.  Maybe there is some possibility that they could both be wrong but if they were both positive then you would have very good evidence that you were infected.  Doctors don't just put patients on Meds for being HIV positive.  Meds start when a persons viral load gets high and their t-cells decline.  Im confused about why you would suggest that a person would test positive for HIV and then automatically be put on meds.  The doctor is the one who does the assessment and looks at all of the persons numbers and then looks at the viral load...do you have faith in the viral load test?  <br>  HIV patients shouldn't be afraid to start on meds their doctor prescribes just because they don't believe they are HIV positive.|`|AA11993638	It sounds like you have tested positive on both tests, and now believe you are negative for some reason, maybe just because you are not actually "sick" yet. If you have had repeated testing using both methods, you are positive. In which case as your t cell count changes and your viral load changes you will be put on medications. If you decide to not take the medications and continue to have sex, you risk not only developing AIDS, but infecting others, which in some areas is a crime. Frankly the medications will do little harm to your body if negative, but can make a major difference if you are positive. So I guess the decision is up to you, pretend you are not infected and risk becoming severely ill and dieing, or accept the test results and take the medication in the attempt to remain healthy for decades to come.
0nyWiro9aa	Rhesus originally came from monkeys as that is a type of monkey where the antigen got it's name. It pertains to the RH (rhesus) or as people out there know it as RH negative if they don't have the antigen or RH - or Rh positive + if they have the antigen or factor.<br>  <br>  In order to be afflicted, the baby must contain the antigen (Rh+) and the mother must not contain the antigen (RH-). When blood from the baby enters the mother, the mother produces antibodies to the baby cells (anti-Rh +) that can damage the baby. This is termed RH disease in your words. From the above description you can see that if the mother contains the antigen then she can not produce such an antibody to the RH and thus babies who are RH negative have nothing to worry about. If one has the positivity for the antigen or factor then they can not produce and antibody to it as it would damage themselves.

Men come in all penis sizes and women come in all vaginal tightness. Some men like the *** because it is tighter than some women's vagina's. Tight can bring more pleasure. Also there is a 'naughty' factor about playing with a part of the body that is not considered part of the reproductive system. if you and your partner like anal sex use a condom. They is more chance of anal tearing and bleeding which increases the chance of STDs. Also the anus has more bacteria than the vagina.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Everybody is born bisexual to some degree including you! <br>   <br>  Most people choose their most dominant desire side,  some deny their least dominant side, even to themselves!<br>   <br>  Some, for social and/or family reasons, try to go with the least dominant side but end up having to admit reality!<br>  <br>  Everybody is, and should be treated as socially equal, whatever their gender or sexual orientation, only you can decide the strength of your feelings for any desire side!|`|cr2KKT6Naa	if thats what the couple enjoys id say no. but when your doing it . and your think'n  of a different anal. and alot of hair on it. well maybe you need to be check in . a padded room.|`|oVx23EAiaa	What guy doesent like ***.  as long as its not some guys butt your not gay.

MPX0f5jzaa	"Player" is such a stupid word.  I have never been "played" in my lifetime, I have ongoing friendships w/ almost all sexual partners I've had.  Nobody got hurt.  People that get hurt by that are just doormats to begin with.<br>  <br>  If you're asking if women can have sex w/o love, yes.<br>  <br>  If you're asking if women can handle more than one boyfriend at a time, yes.<br>  <br>  If you're asking if women can have sex with more than one man at the same time, like a threesome, then yes.<br>  <br>  If someone calls a woman a slut for it, they're just weak in their confidence and their own sexuality.<br>  <br>  And BTW, being a player NEVER meant to "kick someone to the curb" after using someone sexually.  It means that you have many lovers and that's all.  If people get offended by that, that's their own problem.  Unhealthy views of sexuality, gotta love 'em.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	yea, its called being a slut, skank|`|XTj0LP6gaa	Sure they can be.

I had like 9 different dudes I was talking to and they were buying me stuff && all of that..Sometimes you have to play the game like a man...so you wont get played.|`|s7jZEE6oaa	Yes. Actually females can be players. Because if a man plays you, you might want to play them back. I refer to female players as skankss. Sorry. I know plenty of them at my school. They always flirt with men and make them think they acutally like them and they dont. They make them think they have a chance and that is just so screwed up if they dont. I dont think its right what they do, but i am not going to voice my opinion about that. Female players are alot less then male players. We are so used to hearing about males being played, so its werid when we here a female played a guy.

Ngc0teBqaa	I've said it before and I'll say it again. No matter what you've read on the Internet, there's no quick fix that'll get rid of your hickey overnight.<br>  <br>  You can speed up the process a little, but your hickey will still be around for a couple of days to a week, depending on how big and dark it is. Try these, but don't expect a miracle:<br>  <br>      * Put an ice pack on it right away. It'll help reduce the swelling, but it won't do much for the color. Make sure you take breaks (10 minutes with ice, then 20 minutes without it) or you'll damage your skin even more.<br>  <br>      * After a day or two, lay a warm washcloth on it for about 15 minutes, three times a day. It'll increase blood flow and get it healing faster.<br>  <br>      * Be healthy. A hickey is really just a bruise, and bruises heal faster on healthy people. Eat lots of fruits and veggies and your body will spend less time freaking out over digestion and more time healing your hickey.<br>  <br>      * Some people say that vinegar mixed with warm water will help the color fade. Try it out, but be warned: it's kind of stinky. <br>  <br>  <br>  There's a rumor out there that toothpaste works, but it's not true. Save your toothpaste for actually cleaning your teeth, thank you.<br>  <br>  Of course, the fastest path towards hickey removal is not to get one in the first place. So when you feel that icky sucking sensation, tell your sweetie to knock it off.|`|23hPHjOqaa	You can't 'get rid' of it, because it is a bruise and will take anything from a few days to weeks to 'heal'. You can try to use some sort of concealer, but im guessing you'll need a lot of it, but don't ask me about that one I know nothing about make-up.<br>  <br>  Next time, try not to be so promiscuous, it really will not get you anywhere.|`|0lmzc0gfaa	there is no way to get rid of a hickey a hickey is a bunch of blood clots on your skin some people try all sorts of tricks that dont work like combing your skin with a comb or putting a warm cloth on it but it doesnt work you can try to put some makeup on but or cover it with your hair or a scarf but thats about it. it only takes less then a week for it to go away then you can hide it easely hate to say this but maybe your best bet is to just tell the guy your not feeling well and date him 3 days later cause if he sees your hickeys he will know someone elses mouth have been there and he  might not like that  then again youll never know maybe he wont care but if you like him i wouldnt risk it|`|9SsnOPgtaa	do not worry about it.  if you rub it or put anything on it, it'll probably just make it more noticeable.  It's like a cold sore... putting carmex on it just makes it shiny and more noticeable.|`|ZQbfO1Zqaa	concealer and a scarf . good luck

hdFSt0xNaa	I know someone with the exact same problem, who uses salycillic acid, but the spots always form.<br>  <br>  As for why this happens,I think for her at least its just hyper pigmentation around pimples, which most people also have around their armpits, knees and elbows. Some people are lucky enough not to have to deal with hyper pigmentation, but some are just unlucky :(<br>  <br>  My friend treats them by mixing a little bit of lemon juice with yogurt and applying it to affected areas. Also 20 mins before showering at night, you should put vitamin E oil on the affected areas to make them softer.<br>  try this!<br>  Hopefully it should help (:|`|jQt1NOOxaa	Don't worry. Instead of treating them with medicine use AUT.Be vegetarian, use Auto urine therapy. Read Martha Kristi's book on AUTO urine therapy.
YdOyAcAAaa	Cereal = Sugar in disguise.<br>  <br>  Tuna = Very good!<br>  <br>  Cracker biscuits (not sure what you mean) = If it's not 100% WHOLE GRAIN, then it's bad.<br>  <br>  Grapes = Good, but fruit is optional... Has a lot of sugars.  Don't overdo on them.<br>  <br>  Chocolate Chip Cookie = Bad...<br>  <br>  Sweet and Sour Chicken = Probably a lot of sugar hidden in the sauce.  Chicken is very good, veggies very good, and I'm guessing it had rice?  If it was white rice, that's bad.  Brown rice is very good, however.<br>  <br>  Banana = Same as grapes.|`|he18hGKNaa	Sounds like a great days meal.  You ate constantly through the day, so you kept your metabolism running.  And dont buy into the sugar is bad thing.  A little bit of sugar can benefit your body and is completely fine in moderation.  Just make sure that you're also drinking plenty of water through the day.  No matter how healthy you eat, everything you eat has wastes in it, and the water helps to clean that out and keep it from turning into fatcells.  You can try oatmeal for breakfast to mix it up, thats a good oldfashioned healthy but quick breakfast.  The hardest part of keeping a healthy diet is getting bored with meals.  Be creative and keep up the good work :)|`|imDv8YzPaa	instead of a tuna snack for lunch, try a tuna sandwich with whole grain bread and salad. but you did really good today, well done!<br>  <br>  Also, for max health, dont forget to get like 30 mins of cardio in at least and some resistance training 3 times a week|`|nTXGaBvLaa	Yes you ate very healthy today!  I think everything from the food group!
VXQFT341aa	You do not need to let your abs recover. They are the one muscle you can work every day. The people that are telling you this know nothing of fitness.|`|inI1fkx7aa	It's generally best for any muscle group if you don't do targeted work with them every day of the week.  With abs this can be more or less true depending on the person.  As you're a soccer player, I'm going to assume you're relatively active and athletic so what I'd suggest is picking two days out of the week to just do general cardio and leg/arm workouts instead of heavy ab ones.<br>  <br>  The deep heat will help with pain and stiffness, but it won't give the muscles a chance to fully work through what you've put them through with a heavy workout.  You don't have to alternate days the way the average slum might need to, but you'll likely see better results if you give them a day or two off every week!

Exercise sensibly.|`|M2XQMPNNaa	You obviously know this is a ridiculous and unhealthy plan. You will only slow your metabolism down.

If he/she exposes the nerve when drilling, it will lead to a root canal and a crown-  whether there is pain now or not.  So, the sooner the better.  Hopefully it is still at the stage where just a filling will do.<br>  <br>  Most dentists will put in tooth colored fillings.  If they still offer the silver colored, just ask for white.|`|g2JlIuRcaa	please go to a dentist. I chipped my tooth real bad about 3 weeks ago.

I didn't notice until it was already chipping away as well. If it isn't a molar, then it's probably just a cavity escalating to the decay stage. Check with your dentist :)|`|qlECsz0Iaa	it depends, if you hit your mouth recently, that would be the only thing to cause a chip, sounds like cavity to me.
wg4XdI5taa	To know how many calories you need you have to multiply 7 times your body weight. Which equals 1890. So every time you lose weight you have to eat less calories. (sucks i know I've been there) When you eat the best way is to eat the same out amount but seperate it through the day. And please don't skip a meal because that is the most important meal of the day. The reason why is because when you eat in the morning it begins to start your metabolism. So ya split your meals like into 5 (Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner). If your having problems with hunger i would recommend getting a protein shake with low calories a lot of people go on protein shakes because it is hard for your body to digest protein which makes your body not hungry for a good while. <br>  <br>  Also to help you out more. exercise it is very important and it seems like your doing a good job, but what i would recommend is to have goals when your working out. I know you said previously that you can't jog much but i would recommend for you to at least jog as much as you can and set goals on how much you jog. So what i would do is like walk for about 15 min to let your body warm up, then start jogging then once your tired start walking again. Also try to do other work outs too. It's the only way your going to trick your body and make it react faster which equals faster weight lose. For example some abs, squats, and work outs using light weights if you can. I know when i herd that i was like uh oh but when you actually do them you actually start feeling good about your self cause all the little things you said you couldn't do was a lie cause you can do anything if you just put your mind in to it. Also if there is anyways you can work out in the morning instead of the night it will be soo much better. Cause the best time to work out is in the morning. I worked at 7 in the morning which sucked cause i had to work out at 5a.m. and then go to work right after. But like i said it shocks your body and makes it start working right away.|`|7zwEIVkGaa	It takes thirty minutes for you to feel full so eat very slowly.

bjqjkDMHaa	It's torture.  I have intrusive thoughts caused by OCD, and in some instances, it is positively horrible.  One time I took a trip to the beach with my cousins, and I got a new bad thought stuck in my head on the way there.  It was positively hell.  I couldn't tell anyone about it, it tortured me and I couldn't do anything at all that would dispel it.  That's what it's like to have OCD.  Horrible.  Positively horrible.  A lot of people with OCD obsess over things like fears of hurting someone, fears of being a pervert, a fear that they were homo, a fear that ___.  It can be anything, really. My worst one right now is that I'd just snap and kill myself.  It really, really sucks having OCD.

But you need to eat WAYYY less! Like 1200 calories maybe? IDK how tall you are. just don't eat as much and exercise more. Remember: nothing tastes as good as thin feels!
SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  As others have suggested you might be replacing blubber with muscle so although your weight is still the same the composition of your body is different.<br>  Another possibility:<br>  It′s not enough to blindly watch your caloric intake. For the body to get rid of the fat you need to reduce your intake to below maintenance levels. Perhaps you are not doing that. Try eating less for 4 days in a row, then eat enough to maintain weight for the next 5-7 days or so and then repeat. <br>  Another possibility:<br>  You might be over trained. In that case the body pretty much shuts down and all sorts of nasty stuff starts to happen:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtraining" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtrainin...</a><br>  Overtraining is not the same form one person to another. Just keep in mind that more training is not better, optimum is best! Over training is very easy to overlook.<br>  Good luck!|`|lBKfmRWCaa	When you exercise your body changes, it burns fat and starts to gain muscle mass. Muscle is heavier than fat so you might not see an actual "weight" reduction yet.|`|AlrCZJ3saa	Change the things you do, mix it up- samething over and over gets your body used to the things, and isnt as effective|`|h7Z7dxK9aa	change routine and change your adaptation. this is because your body adapts to what your putting in or burning.

WwTxboY9aa	Yes sinusitis is a possibility, particularly if the pain spreads across the eyebrows and bridge of the nose, it also effects the cheak bones, and even the ears sometimes. <br>  Another possibility is what they call a tension headache, caused by stress. If you ask a doctor about it they will be able to tell you how to fix it. For sinusitis , well both really - massaging, and gently applying pressure under the eyebrows with your thumbs , and along other areas that are aching really helps reduce the tension and unblock the sinuses. <br>  Hope that helps.|`|WWnkeaIAaa	it's a curse|`|d94677ecce02ae2db351b104cd6f9c6caa	Sinuses are located in the forehead area.  Usually sinus headaches also include the cheeks, though, since the lower sinuses don't drain as well as the upper ones.  Foreheads also have lots of muscles that we tighten up during stress, and make for headaches later.  Consciously trying to keep a relaxed face can help.  Caffeine use or irregularities can also cause some whopper headaches, as can overuse or prolonged use of pain killers.  Good luck!|`|AViaAFyhaa	I don't know, i want to find out 2.

LGkb4xibaa	obviously, i'm not a trained professional. But one thing i do know is you have plenty left to fight with. If you went to these professionals the first time around then you have more strength in you than you know.<br>  <br>  You need to find a new therapist you can trust. Its daunting i know. But there will be another person out there that will make a suitable therapist for you. Its a case of finding someone you initially like, then learning to trust them. It can be done.<br>  <br>  While your waiting to find the right professionals, try and talk to friends and family as much as possible. Explain to them your condition and ask them to be patient with you. Hopefully you will find one or two that will be particularly understanding. <br>  <br>  You can also try samaritans, who helped me on occassions. Or find a support group near you or online.

Wet shave will get more hair and closer so that you look better.|`|AA11785060	All just personal preference.  One doesn't cause the hair to grow differently, you are shaving off dead tissue regardless so cutting off something dead doesn't change how it grows.  Hair grows from under the skin and anything you see is dead tissue. Some guys just prefer electric to regular razors- I've tried electric but none have ever been able to cut my neck hairs so It looked scuzzy  and had to shave my neck with a  regular razor anyway.  I think it also depends on how thick your beard hairs are-- like mine are thick so didn't shave well with an electric. But I know loads of guys, usually the older generation, that use electrics and always have.
Q4NFFBizaa	you should be fine as it sounds like you were taking it as prescibed by your doctor. The people who go through withdrawls are the people who abuse the drug. They take 20, 10mg vics a day.

Compression reduces the space between the tears that helps with the healing process. <br>  <br>  Also, compression makes muscles more efficient, so they don't get tired as quickly, also helping you feel less ache.  If your muscles are compressed, muscle action is more focused.  It makes your muscles denser, so they work better.|`|9ydlIWUNaa	it probably gets your blood to circulate round your body.

You really ought not worry about it unless you eat very unhealthy and its hard for you to go up and down stairs without being severely winded. Okay? Don't stress, you are too young to worry about it and if you mess with your body too much trying to be oober thin then when you are older you are more likely to be fat because you've screwed up your metabolism.|`|G5Y725Tpaa	It depends on how tall you are as well.

TORBP6QIaa	There is probably some scar tissue which cpuld pull when you breathe deeply.  I suggest you speak with your doctor about this discomfort.  I think you should be doing some gentle exercise as well which is something your doctor or nurse can advise you on.<br>  <br>  That would have been quite an extensive surgery they performed on you so I dont think its too unusual for you to still feel some discomfort.<br>  <br>  Take care.
zf6LT9Amaa	It depends on the country. Also there's a big difference between therapy and going into a mental health unit - hospitals are for really acute mental health problems whereas therapy is for those who are safe to live in a community but need help as they struggle with their everyday feelings. You will only be admitted to a hospital if you're problems are severe enough, but first seek therapy then if you can't cope you will be referred from there.|`|Vwqaen0saa	It Depends On The Place|`|yzli4CZ0aa	if you go to mental hospital and tell them you are affraid of harming yourself, chances are they will take you right away. i dont know your situation but i would wait to long, there is help available.

You are slowly but surely damaging your health with your lack of proper eating, drinking the wrong things and pacing your metabolism until it cracks. Your kidney pain is reflective of your body screaming out for adequate food and water and if you continue this regime you are heading for serious collapse.  My concern is that you seem to be able to effectively talk about it but cannot recognise the dangers .... please seek medical advice and follow it to the letter .. also get someone to support you here.
WnMrgSg4aa	I think you need to get some help. Its sounds like you have an eating disorder!<br>  The weight for your age sounds very low, and your diet is shocking. You are definitely not getting the required nutrients needed.<br>  Your periods have stopped!

It can really screw your body up. Try eating about 1500 calories a day and MODERATE exercise. You are probably just going through puberty, where some parts of your body gain more weight than others. If you get strong pains in your kidneys, you should really see a doctor because it could be serious.|`|sjJSjtynaa	Your getting bulkier in your stomach because u workout while drinking coffe.

You haven't said how tall you are so it is impossible to work out what your BMI is to see how underweight you are.<br>  <br>  Why are you doing this to yourself. On average females are supposed to consume 2000 calories or more a day. Those pains you are getting could signal the start of long term health problems which would be awful for you. Also you said your periods have stopped which again prove that your body isn't functioning properly.<br>  <br>  There are enough starving people in the world who don't have a choice due to there being no food available why voluntarily punish yourself. If you are worried about your stomach do more situps and jogging. <br>  <br>  All the best|`|pAVoCiIkaa	if you want to be one of those unhappy women that have an eating disorder and eat pretty nothing, then go for it. but you will regret this. It would probably take months for your body to get used to eating normally. You should at least eat 6 times a day,but eat little meals to lose weight faster|`|1NJzCNG1aa	You should EAT! Its no good starving yourself you will get anorexia. Try eating salads and drinking healthy drinks like strawberry milkshake. Its all about a balanced diet.|`|inI1fkx7aa	Starving yourself might actually be making this worse.  Look at pictures of children from third world countries... a large number have distended stomachs due to a lack of nutrition.  You might be doing this to yourself!<br>  <br>  Also, some females will always have a "pouch" on their bodies.  This is NOT fat, but the added thickness of your uterus under your stomach and ab muscles.  If you are naturally lighter-framed, it is more likely to be noticeable, especially when you are very underweight.<br>  <br>  Consult a nutritionist to find out your ideal weight and eating habits and then stick with it.  An extreme diet like the one you're on is not healthy, and it sounds like you need some serious help with your self-image.  I'd suggest talking to a psychiatrist as well.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	You don't have a fat stomach, you are anorexic.  Your exercise routine is going to be worthless as you're not consuming enough energy to exercise properly OR build up your body, hence the lack of tone that you believe is fat.  Believe me I've been there, and your symptoms are serious (In the UK you could well end up in a mental institution being force fed!).<br>  <br>  You seriously need to admit firstly to yourself that you have an eating disorder.  Next admit this to your family and friends, and make them force you to eat at the same time as they do; you need to make meal times a social and acceptable event.  The third segment is to see your doctor with a view to getting regular sessions with a dietitian who can advise on what to eat, exercise, and mental techniques.<br>  <br>  Honestly, you'll find your stomach will look much better if you are eating enough to be able to exercise PROPERLY and build up some tone.  You need to work on letting your conscious mind over rule the subconscious side that says you are overweight.  It's not easy, It's almost 30 years since I was in a similar position to yourself, and I still catch myself thinking those same warped thoughts at times!
XDf8xSyyaa	Your period won't stop the treatment from working, it just might be a bit messy.  If you wear tampons you can easily place in the pessary then the tampon no problem.

Otherwise, see if you can get a quick appointment with a gastroenterologist.  <br>  <br>  I cannot believe that the doc didn't do anything for this.  The doc could not have possibly diagnosed your problem if they did not at least examine a stool sample, and most likely, a doc needs to look at your stomach/small intestine with an endoscope.    <br>  <br>  Your symptoms do not point to any simple problem. Possibly,  you have an ulcer in the stomach or small intestine.  When an ulcer is accompanied by a fever, it's possible that the ulcer is large enough for stomach contents to leak into your abdominal cavity and cause an infection - if this is actually happening, the situation is an emergency.  <br>  <br>  If i were in your situation, i would go to an ER if i felt really sick from an infection.  If i just had pain and a fever, but otherwise felt more or less OK, i would be willing to wait a day or two to see a gastroenterologist.  However, since its the weekend, Monday is the earliest you could get an appointment with a gastroenterologist.    It's a difficult call - you really need to at least get a fecal occult sample to make any decisions.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	since you have black tarry stools thats a sign of blood somewhere in your GI tract, you could have an ulcer, or a bad infection especially with that high fever<br>  <br>  I would get to the doctor ASAP|`|aKnoADs1aa	go to a different doc  yours isnt helpful. if symtoms persist or fever gets higher go to the hospital  your temp is getting in the danger zone|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	Eat small portions of bland food but not before bed.  take an antacid.

5VVkzqxhaa	Hello, Sorry to hear about your troubles. This sounds like it could be kidney stones. Drink plenty of water. If you drink alcohol, stop for a while and see if that helps. Also, go to www.mayoclinic.com. On the home page there is a "symptoms checker" that will give you help. I use this resource a lot. If you have fever and are still vomiting make an appointment with your Dr. as soon as possible. Also call the hospital where you had your c-section and tell the Dr. or the Drs. Nurse that you are having complications. Good luck to you and the children and may god be with you all.|`|yBgRDe9Vaa	I don't know Girl...could you be pregnant AGAIN??  Sometimes that happens...very fertile after having a baby...possible...happens!  Try drinking some herbal Chamomile tea...it relaxes the muscles and helps you sleep or even a glass of milk.  Also, lifting those babies could be part of the problem/stress, too.  If not pregnant, maybe the doc will give you a muscle relaxer that will help the cramps/back/sleep, etc.  Also get that fella to get up in the night for some of those chores.  C-Section may be healing pains as well...I just don't know.

zxdEYy3Iaa	The problem with the muscle cramps is probably related to dehydration.  Most people don't drink enough water and are therefore dehydrated without drinking.  When you drink, the alcohol turns into pure sugar in your system (on top of the sugar in that cherryade).  All of this causes more dehydration.  <br>  <br>  If you insist on drinking alcohol, try drinking at least 5-6 bottles of water during the day prior to the night out and chug a full bottle of water before you go to bed.  This should help prevent any cramping and/or hangovers.  (Note: some people also find it helpful to keep a bottle of water on hand while drinking, sipping on it throughout the night; this might help you also.)<br>  <br>  Keep a bottle of Gatorade in the fridge as back up, just in case.

If so, one thing you could try is to get out of bed as soon as a cramp hits, and go stand barefoot on a cold, hard floor, such as the bathroom tiles.  Two or three minutes should be enough.  I have no idea why this works, but it always does the trick for me!

She feeds off of the idea that other people are watching her, so she has to kind of "show off" to work out harder than they are.<br>  <br>  However, I like to exercise leisurely.  I'm more self driven and want to enjoy working out... so I do everything at home when its comfortable for me.  Ultimately there's a regular resistance exercise for everything you can do at the gym.  Pushups work your entire upper body, so they're great.  There are dozens of different ab exercises that can be done at home.  For the cost of a months gym membership you can buy a handful of free weight dumbbells from a sports store, and have a hundred different exercises to do at home on your own.<br>  <br>  But like my friend, maybe you need motivation from feeling like someone else is watching and you dont want to let them down.

Stop eating any food or drink that contains any form of sugar, such as sucrose, glucose, fructose, dextrose, palm sugar, or corn syrup. Avoid any food that is made from flour, this means pasta, pastries, or gravy. Eat plenty of raw vegetables like celery, carrots, radishes. Eat plenty of fresh fruit. Eat plenty of unprocessed meat.|`|fcbf59d3765fc40afec4d3523db17ba8aa	Drink 2L of water a day. No soft drinks.|`|he18hGKNaa	Drink TONS of water.  Water boosts your metabolism and is often overlooked.  Also eating regularly speeds up losing weight.  Regularly eating small meals keeps your metabolism running through the day continuously without any slow points.  Also dont eat within the last four hours of your day.  If your bedtime is at 10, dont eat anything after 6.  This can be difficult though.  If you have a desk job, sit on a medicine ball.  That way youre constantly exercising through the entire day.  There's hundreds of ways to lose weight fast without drastically altering your lifestyle and without putting yourself at any health risks.|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|dPgc8p9saa	laxatives and prune juice!!|`|AA11573460	do max exercise.rope skipping,drink water wen u r hungry.|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!

I happen to be married to an Osteopath and I can assure you they are not big supporters of the Big Pharm industry.  I believe that description belongs to the MDs. It is true that Osteopaths and MDs have identical training and the difference  today is largely political.  Osteopath philosophy has always been that the body has the capacity to heal itself and much of that was encouraged years ago by the use of OMT or Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy.  Unlike Chiropractors, Osteopaths used manipulation therapies on the entire body.  It is great stuff.  For example, when our kids were small and caught a cold, instead of pumping them full of decongestants and antibiotics, my husband did postural drainage and other forms of manipulation along with some natural herbal therapies to reduce their congestion.  More and more Osteopaths today are returning to some of the old practices that seem to be experiencing a renaissance of the "New Medicine" of complimentary, functional and alternative ways of treating patients without drugs, or at least fewer drugs. Hope this explanation helps with your understanding these two professions.|`|sjJSjtynaa	short version:Chiropractors and osteopaths are both medical professionals who treat patients with a focus on the musculoskeletal system, including the spine, joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. <br>  An osteopath, on the other hand, is much more like a physician, especially in the United States. <br>  Long Version:Chiropractors and osteopaths are both medical professionals who treat patients with a focus on the musculoskeletal system, including the spine, joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The two professions are actually radically different, requiring different levels of certification and ultimately offering different services. There has also been some historical hostility between the two fields, which can make sorting out the differences rather challenging. Essentially, both offer valuable and useful services, and each can be included in a holistic healthcare regimen.<br>  <br>  Let us start by examining the two professions individually. A chiropractor is a medical professional trained in chiropractic medicine, typically in a three to four year program. The student learns about anatomy, physiology, and biology, and focuses on the skeletal system. Chiropractic doctors believe that many health problems are related to imbalances in the musculoskeletal system, and they learn to perform small adjustments to this system while in school. Contrary to popular belief, these adjustments are not limited to the back. Chiropractics is a specialty, as opposed to osteopathy, which is more like a medical philosophy.<br>  <br>  An osteopath, on the other hand, is much more like a physician, especially in the United States. Osteopaths believe in treating the body as a whole, and including the muscoloskeletal system as an important structure in their practice, but they do not believe that a myriad of problems can be solved through adjustments. They focus on preventative medicine and caring for the musculoskeletal system to reduce problems, but they also offer other types of medical treatment. In the United States, an osteopath is a licensed physician, able to perform surgery, prescribe medicine, and offer other medical services depending on what field the osteopath has chosen to specialize in.<br>  <br>  Both professions have trade organizations such as the American Osteopathic Association to oversee the activities of their members. An osteopath and a chiropractor must both take qualifying examinations before being admitted to practice, and they must participate in continuing education to be licensed through the region in which they practice. Both may also provide referrals to medical specialists in order to treat particular conditions.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, an osteopath receives more education than a chiropractor, especially for some specialties. One might compare an osteopath to a medical doctor with a focus on holistic health, whereas a chiropractor practices in a highly specialized and unique field. An osteopath can provide general care, including manipulations, while a chiropractor offers the specific service of adjustments and manipulations with the intent of improving health and reducing pain.|`|yDdxM8R0aa	The biggest difference between the two would be their underlying interests.  D.O.'s support the big Pharm industry. Chiropractors support their patients.  They are like oil and water and I would never trust an osteopath to adjust anything!<br>  <br>  BTW, the biggest difference is in the amount of malpractice insurance each must carry. This tells all!

You could try using lots of lube..it will help his penis enter you easier, but make sure it's water based because oil based lubes can deteriorate condoms.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you're very stimulated beforehand...lots of foreplay will help ready your body for penetration.  Also, you may want to have him finger you a lot before you go for the actual sex--just to help loosen you up a little bit.  <br>  <br>  If it's pain that's stopping you...you're going to have to just go for it.  Clench your jaw and let him go for it.  Bleeding and pain is normal for a girl's first time.  <br>  <br>  If all else fails, try letting him enter you from a woman on top position or rear entry position.  Woman on top will give you more control and of course it will be really easy to just sit right on it and have it go right in.  Rear entry will be easier for him to penetrate than missionary (if that's how you were doing it.  most people do it that way their first time).  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps!|`|eKDYbe9Laa	may u have pain thats why|`|LW9YSK8Xaa	maybe he wasn't hard enough
edAtsw3waa	I am a beauty therpaist and the routine we use at our salon is:<br>  <br>  Cleanse-to remove surface dirt.<br>  Steam-to loosen up the pores<br>  Cleanse Again-deep cleanses to help breakdown congestion.<br>  Exfoliate-to remove any excess dead skin.<br>  Tone-not necessary, and do not use harsh products with alcohol.<br>  Moisturise-to soften the skin and return the skin's pH back to normal.<br>  <br>  Note: The reason we cleanse first is so that all traces of make-up and surface dirt are removed, so that the exfoliant can really do its job and remove all that dead skin under there. :-)
KI4NieoTaa	I think i was about 10, and i was sick with tonsalitis.(how ever you spell it, the thing when you get a sore throat). And it hurt that much all i did was drink litres and litres of water. Not going to the toilet before bed, i wet myself. And for about a year and a half, i was scared i was going to do it again, so i used to get a pillow and put it into my legs, and for some strange reason, it made me feel like i wasnt going to do it. embarrasing i know.<br>  And i always got soooo worried when we had to go on long drives to places, cos i always needed to ask my parents for the toilet.<br>  But now i go to the toilet every night before bed, and dont drink anything in the car. It seems to pass, sooner or later. So dont worry, you'll get over it soon. =]<br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|bF3DAb1faa	Perhaps this needs exploring in therapy to find origins|`|SzYQVW0Naa	My wife had a problem like this but not quite that bad. We found out that a lot of people who have over active bladder, have a bladder that sits right on top of the colon. Our Homeopathic doctor had my wife take her fingers and place them right above the tail bone.( That's right at the lowest part of the stomach) Press in firmly and push up three times, twice a day. This completely got rid of her problem.|`|AA10461680	if you just accept, "maybe tonight ill wet the bed, and i dont care", you most likely will not wet the bed and you will have a good sleep|`|eslMlHdyaa	I think you should do it, wet yourself in public and see that there's nothing to be afraid of.|`|f7XpEvFtaa	my sister is like this, its genetic.<br>  go see a doctor and they can provide professional help, its a kind of OCD.|`|euRCoiIRaa	First, you must solve the daytime problem. Afterwards, you can solve the nighttime problem.<br>  Daytime problem : You must leave the diapers. It is just as leaving the cigarrettes. From now on, you will decide to go out with normal underwear, as everybody. Tell to yourself that perhaps you will wet your panties, only a little, and that you don’t mind. Nobody will punish you. Tell you that if someone laugh, then you will laugh loudly with him (her).<br>  After this experience, solving the nighttime problem would not be so difficult.|`|aZiRDELCaa	GAF
tbrWvktCaa	With anything to do with breathing it's always a good idea to see a MD.  The pain could be due to a spontaneous pneumothorax, emboli or even gas.|`|yBgRDe9Vaa	GET TO THE DOCTOR PRONTO!!  If it's your heart, they can tell.  If it's HEARTBURN, eat some canned PEACHES plus the juice...I've found that kills it instantly.  Take deep breaths and let out slowly.  Also, it could be arthritis in your breast bones.  Get to the doc though...they can tell the difference, and you don't want to mess around with THIS AT ALL!!|`|ZfvoW3m7aa	it could be your liver or it could be gallstones.

LrGmpacOaa	Your breasts may shrink a bit more, but that's because you're losing body fat. When you hit puberty the ducts WITHIN your breasts start to grow. So you will never be completely flat-chested.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with having small breasts.|`|QwkYH61Naa	you will be beautiful no matter the size of your breasts so don't worry about it. You'll be happier when you weight less and i'm sure you will look great too
O8XjkCjxaa	You could break your hymen, which is technically your virginity. You can break your hymen doing exercise or anything. I broke my hymen whilst out running, so I'd be a bit gutted if that was my 'first time'.<br>  <br>  But you really break your virginity when you have sex, it's more of a mental thing.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	That depends on your definition of virginity. I think you are a virgin until your vagina is penetrated by a penis!<br>  You can break your hymen in all sorts of ways, including fingering, but that does not mean you are no longer a virgin!|`|Gsdb68fUaa	nooonononoooo <br>  i guess theres a chance you can rip your hymen which is what happens when you have sex for the first time<br>  but thats not necessarily loosing your virginity<br>  the dicks gotta be in ya lol|`|za9b8cHKaa	Nope. Virgin is generally taken to mean that you have not had sex. Masturbation, while a sex act is not sexual intercourse.
oiB4KATuaa	60 kilo's isnt that much, depending on how tall you are I suppose? When I was your age my weight increased a fair bit because your body's changing and doing all sorts of things so when I was older the weight dropped and settled down. I would suggest if you want to lose weight dont do any weird/crash diets because you can't stick with something you hate and you can't live like that forever, so even if it does work temporarily once you stop you'll just go back to being the same as you was before. You just need to have a diet where you are eating enough food to not always be hungry and just keep down the sugar and saturated fat down, no fast food etc but you should have an occasional treat otherwise its all you'll think and obsess about, try thinking about swapping cravings for better ones ie maybe you think you desperately need some chocolate, but you might just be craving something sweet and would also be happy with low fat fruit yogurt you know? As for exercise, personally I hate it, so I just try to do it in way I wont notice like is there a sport or a dance class you might enjoy, can you walk to school? or get dropped off somewhere a bit further away from school and walk the rest? Can you walk to your friends house? The other thing that I do is I have a aerobics video so I dont have to worry about joining a class or paying money or doing it at a set time so that helps...so my best advice would be to find exercise you like or can fit into your life without much thought and just eat good, dont starve, the only time I've put on weight is when I've starved! Have a look on the net for the amount of calories you should eat in a day and also what kinda of food to have and to avoid...but like I said my weight was quite high around that age and went back down again so try not to worry about it too much!|`|r8VvBxM6aa	I know it's not easy, but once you can block out everyone else's negativity you can focus on your own positivity. If you need, write out a list of things you like about yourself, go shopping and give yourself a makeover. Whatever you do though, do it for you, and not to please anyone. At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|y4ASgBa9aa	130pounds doesn't seem a lot how tall r u<br>  If ur taller than 5ft and 2inchs ur fine dear
YdOyAcAAaa	Trying to burn fat or gain muscle?  Sounds like you already lost the fat that you want, I would just lift weights... Keep doing cardio, though.  And don't think just because you're a woman that you don't want to lift weights.  Women need to lift weights more than men, believe it or not.  You will NOT get big and bulky, you don't have the hormones.
RTa3g9ZHaa	Of course.|`|pwr5thrFaa	Yes there is a possibility, especially if you had come already, or had precum leaking it could have come out of the condom.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	It depends if semen has been spilt.  If you are sure the semen is still all in the reservoir then you should be pretty safe.  If you think some may have spilt perhaps you need to go and get the morning-after pill.  For future reference, have the guy hold onto the top of the condom when he is withdrawing.|`|Yz1WdCE6aa	In a word Yes, the sperm could have escaped from the condom at the time of withdrawal. Go and get Plan B (the morning after pill). May be a good idea to use some other form of contraception along with condoms this way no worries. Good Luck|`|P7UgonvNaa	It's unlikely as long as the opening of the condom was still hanging out. But just to make sure you could try getting the morning after pill. And go on contraceptives pills too as a back up.|`|Y8OKGMkwaa	the condom what?.....lol
ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|cWuumdy7aa	you will not reach 6 ft your hight will grow till age of 18.|`|AA10202389	Statistics show that people from more loving families grow taller. You might look up Emotional Intelligence. It's used in sports, business and family counseling, to name a few. Fear stunts growth. As long as we fear, growth is put on hold. Fear is an emotion caused by thoughts and usually wrong ones in modern society. Besides, looking into those things gets you a whole lot more bonuses along the way.<br>  It's old science to say it's genes.

c5ScseTdaa	No salt?  Rats, there goes my favorite flavoring!<br>  <br>  I cook my rice in good chicken broth, which makes it delicious.  You can get low sodium chicken broth, which typically comes with onion and carrot as flavorings, among other things.  Of the boxed brands I've tried, progresso is my favorite.  It's second to home-made chicken broth.<br>  <br>  Saffron is a lovely seasoning in rice.  Mmmm!  A bit pricey, though.<br>  <br>  Rosemary is also nice.  I use a combination of rosemary, garlic, thyme, oregano, white pepper, and ginger in everything if I'm sick, and leave the ginger out if I'm not.  Of course, garlic never tastes right without a little salt, so you might want to leave that out as well.<br>  <br>  Fresh veggies, believe it or not, make wonderful flavorings. Carrots and onions are obvious, but I also like the flavor spinach lends to rice when you toss in just a handful.  Oh, and sweet bell peppers!  Now there's a wonderful flavor!  Extra vitamins, too.<br>  <br>  Happy cooking.  I'm afraid I can't help with the kangaroo meat--I've never had it!

KOYC3XkJaa	When you sustain any injury, including sunburn, that activates your body's inflammatory response, which causes swelling at the site of the injury and the surrounding area. Since your nose is in the surrounding area it is swelling as well. It's also possibly that your nose is also sunburned. Sunburns can cause a sort of fluid retention effect and cause swelling in and of itself.<br>  Take some anti-inflammatories and use some ice. Keep a cloth between the ice and your skin. The swelling should go down. And put some aloe on your sunburn.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Actually, if you drink whiskey while in the sun, your nose will never come down.

k2NRCYo9aa	If you smoked one or two times, it will take about 30 days to leave your system (for urine test purposes).  If you are a heavy smoker or smoke several times per week, it will take as much as 90 days.  Your body's fat percentage is something else to take into account.  The more fat you carry, the longer it will take for THC to leave your system as it is fat soluble and is stored in fat cells. <br>  <br>  I know there will be some suggestions to drink lots of water.  That will just make a urine test come up too dilute, and they will call you in to retest within a week.

Also eating too much of an acidic food (like sour candy, cranberry juice) can make urine burn.  The organs that regulate the acid/base balance in your body are your lungs and kidneys.  Having bad asthma, and lungs that can't do their share with the regulation, I have to watch the acids, or suffer the consequences.|`|tQ8aZxYqaa	Since uric acid is the byproduct of oxidation from normal metabolic activity it's not something you would want to be without in your urine.

cAy1SI9vaa	ED occurs due to blockage of blood supply to penis and the things that can block the flow of blood may include smoking, a high fat diet, anxiety, tiredness and the wrong mood/mind. ED could also be due to physical reasons such as diabetes, kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, vascular disease, and neurological disease, injury, or side effects of drugs or any disorder that causes injury to the nerves or impairs blood flow in the penis. Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, guilt, depression, low self-esteem, and fear of sexual failure cause are also the major factors of ED cases.

CNW6eAjoaa	I have posted some links below that will help you stretch a tight foreskin.  You can do these without parental or medical intervention.<br>  There will always be contributors who will tell you to just get circumcised.  It is the last thing you need.  It will destroy 75% of the sensitive sexual receptors on your penis.<br>  Follow the information in the  links below and you should start to see some results in about two weeks.  Full and painless retraction can take 3-4 months.  After that, you are set for life.<br>  As an alternative, you can ask your doctor for steroid cream to loosen a tight foreskin.  It just relaxes the muscles skin combination that make up the foreskin, and helps it stretch.  If the doctor even hints at circumcision, be very firm and tell them you do not need it.  Find another doctor who knows how to treat and intact penis if you have to.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this|`|6TSwoU3yaa	In general the case for phimosis is over-emphasised.  Most boys and men just have a tight foreskin, not phimosis.  You do need to understand that phimosis is a medical condition, and if you have that you would have probably already been to see a doctor and would not be asking the question.<br>  <br>  I can't tell what your problem is without a physical examination or a photo (at very least).  But I am almost sure you have a tight foreskin, as do millions of other men around the world.  If you are still going through puberty, then you have nothing to worry about at the moment unless you are actually experiencing some kind of problem.  If that is the case, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is just leave it a lone.  There is a myth that you have to be able to roll back your foreskin.  Why?  I have no idea!  It is a myth.  Your penis and foreskin were designed to work together and if yours was designed to stay closed, then so be it.  It is not an issue.  Just leave it.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	If you can't pull your foreskin back then it's probably a bit tight. Don't worry it's common in puberty and usually fixes itself up.

IF not, then quit worrying.  As long as you can function well and without any pain or difficulty with urination or ejaculation, you are fine.  Not all foreskins retract, and the average age for those that do is around 15.  Doctors don't recommend surgery for most cases until age 19--probably by then the foreskin will detach anyway.  ANd fully 50% of all guys never detach and have no problems.  So if it doesn't hurt and functions like it should, don't worry about it. You are normal

GcWRPLd6aa	Definition of Bipolar disorder<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder: A mood disorder sometimes called manic-depressive illness or manic-depression that characteristically involves cycles of depression and elation or mania. Sometimes the mood switches from high to low and back again are dramatic and rapid, but more often they are gradual and slow, and intervals of normal mood may occur between the high (manic) and low (depressive) phases of the condition. The symptoms of both the depressive and manic cycles may be severe and often lead to impaired functioning.<br>  <br>  Both phases of the disease are deleterious. Mania affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that may cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase. Depression can also affect thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that may cause grave problems. For example, it elevates the risk of suicide. About 5.7 million American adults, or about 2.6 percent of the population aged 18 and older, have bipolar disorder.<br>  <br>  Although bipolar disorder often worsens over time if untreated, most people with bipolar disorder can achieve stabilization of their mood swings and reduction of symptoms with proper treatment. Treatment usually consists of medications known as "mood stabilizers."|`|85vDqn6naa	A rollercoaster ride, lol|`|WEM5n41Oaa	Mood swings between high's and low's.  To be diagnosed with bipolar you need to be hospitalized at least one time.|`|yzdaNwj2aa	Bi-Polar is a mental illness and disability. Symptoms are chronic mood swings from manic to depression. While manic one may experience feelings of invincibility, may overspend money, have racing thoughts and may be very happy or irritable. While depressed the person may not even get out of bed or hurt themselves. It manifests as early as the early teenage years and there are many types. I was diagnosed when I was fifteen with rapid cycling bipolar disorder, which basically means that I am either manic or depressed and there is no middle ground. When I am manic or depressed I can suffer from hallucinations and delusions. I can't work anymore because of these hallucinations even though I am heavily medicated. This disorder is very serious.|`|AA10148408	it is really complex, because there are like 4 or 5 types.  one is always manic, once a year depressed.  another is always depressed, once a year manic, etc.  bottom line, without taking the meds, its a roller coaster.  just like a diabetic needs insulin, this person must take their meds.  contrary to popular belief, the person is not mentally ill, just moody.  alot of people confuse it with crazy but many of them are genius and quite smart.|`|G5Y725Tpaa	Sar has already explained in greater depth, but a summary of bi-polar disorder is basically a form of clinical depression. A sufferer will feel intense mood swings frequently, feeling euphoria (intense happiness) one minute, to feeling suicidal the next. There are two types; type I is more serious, whereas type II is a milder version of bi-polar.
AA10766729	A few days' variation one way or another is perfectly normal, and certainly nothing to get all worked up over.  But if you want to know that you're going to get your period, then I'd recommend using hormonal control.  When I was on the pill, I knew down to the hour when I'd get my period.<br>  <br>  And just so you know, condoms are only about 85% effective (so fail about 15% of the time or just under 1 time out of every 7 uses).  So if you're crazy-worried about getting pregnant, I strongly recommend that you use a more reliable method, like the pill, or back up condoms with a female barrier method like the diaphragm, cervical cap or Lea's Shield.|`|nl2aIBhgaa	well i have an irregular period too...<br>  i either get it on the 21, 22, 26, 31, or the 5th,.....<br>  i dont like it at all. and im only 13..|`|PE8ez4yDaa	I BET YOU HAVE A SKINNY SQUISHY BELLY THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO FEEL AND PUSH ON AND WHAT NOT lol my boyfriend tells me that all the time ha

S7GqsRWDaa	For abs, it depends on what your body type is and what your metabolism is like.  If you have a fast metabolism, you don't need to do cardio if you don't have any extra fat covering your abs.  If you have any fat covering your abs, you need to do cardio, otherwise it will be impossible to see your abs.  <br>  <br>  The next step is doing ab resistance workouts, I'm a firm believer in this because when you want to make any other muscle on your body grow, you use resistance.  Here is an example of an ab workout with resistance:  Lay down, put your feet under something stable, and put a light dumbbell on your chest and hold it there while doing sit ups, this workout is great. <br>  <br>  For Biceps, you need to do Barbell Curls for overall mass.  For Bicep peak, do Concentration Curls.

Also, some girls have their hymen broken before they even have sex at all, such as through horseback riding or other sports.<br>  <br>  And it's losing your virginity, it's not a cherry and it doesn't pop.

It is entirely possible to break your hymen without ever having sex. If you're physically active, especially in "stretchy" activites like horseback riding, rock climbing, gymnastics, etc. it's very likely your hymen is already gone.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, you may or may not bleed after losing your virginity, it usually doesn't bleed a LOT, and there's not really anything you can do to "prevent" it.|`|fd736f8d0c09ac8e05985c431be15b30aa	It's different for every girl.

Wisdom teeth mean that you'll have 32, 8 in each quarter of your mouth. <br>  <br>  Not everyone gets them (I don't have any) but most people do.<br>  <br>  Wisdom tooth removal can be complicated, because they don't usually have enough space to sit normally in the gum. Hence why most people need them removed. Sometimes they grow sideways, sometimes they are trapped by bone. That's why people tend to be put to sleep.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps x|`|kj1md6t0aa	Everyone has wisdom teeth. It's just different for each person whether these teeth will cause problems or be useful. Nowadays, wisdom teeth are all problems. Most people have theirs removed if recommended by their dentist. X-rays confirm if they are impacted or not.|`|jMRwXz3daa	Everyone has wisdom teeth. Usually, you can ask your dentist about them, to see how they are "coming in". Pretty much no one has room in their mouth for wisdom teeth, so they will come in funky (like sideways, or will impact other teeth). This can cause pain and cause teeth to shift, which is why most orthodontists tell kids to get them removed. You don't have to be put to sleep, but I don't know why you would want to be awake. The oral surgeon has to cut your gum open to get to the teeth, which is why I chose to sleep. I got all 4 out with no real problems, and was back to normal activity within a few days.

wv6EuKeTaa	Hello, Graciela. I think it is important to understand something about acai berries - it is just a fruit. It does indeed have a high amount of antioxidants, but a quick trip to the acai page on wikipedia will show you that it is not even the top in that region, either. For the most part, it is a scam in the sense of the companies making money off of false pretenses. Sure, you will hear about people losing weight eating/taking a lot of acai, but let me ask you a serious question.. would the result have been different if it was a lot of a different fruit? Personally, I don't think so.<br>  <br>  If you understand all of this and still want to have some acai, then approach it as any other fruit and enjoy yourself. However, I would stay away from the "free trials" being thrown around. You are almost guaranteed to get burned here, there are a lot of reports of people being charged for extra shipments they didn't ask for.<br>  <br>  If you would like an alternative for weight loss, I'd like to recommend some reading on a diet called calorie shifting. I have heard good things about it, but I'll drop a link below and let you decide for yourself.<br>  <br>  I hope that whichever path you end up taking that you do lose your unwanted weight, you will surely be a much happier person in the end for it.<br>  <br>  Larry|`|m4lwWFElaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - consume less and move more - the difficulties appear when we really try to put that into practice!

Was it your dream as a child to get depressed about some guy before you were even 20?  You probably much bigger and better than that.  You need to move on to achieve your life goals, or else you're going to be stuck in this slump for a long time.  I have experienced some pretty painful breakups in my life.  In some of them I got hurt a lot, and in others other ones I hurt them a lot.  Things happen, especially at age 19, and people simply get devastated.  But you must be stronger because of it.  Get healthy again, make new friends, and the biggest thing: stop using alcohol to control your stress.  Having good physical health is the only way to have good mental health, so start working out, start eating regularly, stop drinking, and start working toward your goals.  I think there are plenty of things you can do to heal, it just starts with will power.  You will not get better if you succumb to the sadness.  More simply - move on with your life.|`|KgKVWv9paa	Yes you are a  bit depressed.  The drinking isn't helping either both with your mental health and your friends.  Take a break from the drinking.

t27SvIPbaa	No they are not helpful and try and convince you that you have depression and give you more dangerous drugs.<br>  <br>  Read on and I will tell you of a natural product that will make you feel well again with lots of energy.<br>  <br>  First off all if you are in the UK, 99% of doctors do not know how to treat thyroid disease. They only know about Thyroxin which is a synthetic CHEMICAL and should not be in your body. It has many side affects, many don’t feel well on thyroxin as you may well find in a couple of months...weight gain, extreme fatigue, frequent bowel movements, puffy eyes and dry skin, and many others.    <br>  <br>  People with under active thyroid glands who take Synthyroid (thyroxine) should be warned that this drug stimulates osteoclast activity, accelerating bone resorption, and leading to osteoporosis. Natural thyroid medication is available in most countries and is far superior. <br>  Thyroid disease has become epidemic, due to our stressful lives and ill-conceived diets. Soy, in particular, which is used so widely now, suppresses thyroid function and should be banned in all its forms. <br>  <br>  In the long term it leads to osteoporosis. In time you will experience these side affects, so please keep the information that I am about to tell you as you WILL need it. You can treat your thyroid by natural medication with NO side affects. The medication is called Armour Thyroid and is derived from pig’s glands that have a great success rate. They actually used to prescribe it in this country for people with thyroid disease. Yet most doctors don’t even know that, in fact most doctors will not have heard of it and advice you against it while not being able to give you scientific evidence why you shouldn’t! That’s because it’s all about money not health. Their problem with natural products is that nobody can patent them, so the government cannot have exclusive ownership. But they can by making up synthetic chemicals.<br>  <br>  What you need to know is that about 85% of people are unable to transfer T4 into T3 when they use Thyroxin. T3 is essential to the function of the main organs of your body. Armour thyroid naturally has T4, T3 and T2 and T1 and it make you feel well with no side affects. Tyrosine does not have T2 & T1. Once you research it at the site below you can order it from the recommended site -<a href="http://www.internationalpharmacy.com/en/home" rel="nofollow">http://www.internationalpharmacy.com/en/...</a><br>  <br>  I was on Thyroxin for two years and did not feel well on it I had absolutely no energy and my weight ballooned up to 19 and a half stone. I started my Armour in April this year and I am now 15 and a half stone with loads of energy. Armour Thyroid helps increase your metabolism where thyroxin slows it down. As you don’t know me, don’t take my word for your health go to <a href="http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/</a>  Sheila Turner (expert on thyroid disease) runs this thyroid patient advocacy site which will inform and educate you on your disease. There are over six hundred other people on that forum who are taking Armour Thyroid and can give you advice. Pretty soon you will see that doctors know absolutely nothing about treating the thyroid. The are ignorant about it.<br>  <br>  Beware of people on this site who are not what they seem, and will try and discredit amour thyroid at every opportunity.<br>  In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by synthetic levothyroxine (T4), or by combinations of synthetic T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.|`|QGyasdZMaa	You should go back to your doctor.  The "normal" range for thyroid levels is very broad, and a low dose of thyroxine might still be appropriate.   <br>  <br>  Alternatively you may have a breathing disorder or narcolepsy or you may be anaemic again.  Your doctor should get to the bottom of it for you.

ZvTYxdmsaa	It can better your posture, which in turn can help reflect your true height. Or it can help stretch your backbone, which is similar to waking up every morning (you're taller in the morning than you are at night because gravity pushes down on your backbone a little bit, pushing the disks a little closer. Stretching exercises like those common in yoga can help with this.)|`|MfKWHH4Naa	No, but it may make your posture better making you appear taller.|`|HetjZkdmaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

inI1fkx7aa	Not knowing your starting weight, I'd guess that you could probably lose somewhere in the 30-40lbs range.  This is assuming that you're starting out at over 180lbs.  At 5'7", your lowest ideal weight at the lightest build is around the 120 mark.  If you're 170-180, I'd guess that if you do watch the calories while eating well and exercising, you can get down to 140-150 without too much problem, which is a very good weight for 6 months of work.<br>  <br>  I generally "guess" at 5lbs per month of work.  6 months = about 30lbs.  Now, starting out 50lbs overweight ups that a bit, so you'll probably be in the 35lb range.<br>  <br>  PS: Horseback riding is good when you're trotting or faster... a trot is like a walk/jog and a gallop like a full-out jog in terms of burning calories.  Maybe much out some stalls... that will burn a good number too!|`|WlTTrx8aaa	50pounds..maybe if you did extreme but if you want to look healthy take it easy you can drop down about..25 pounds maybe 30 and thing is youll look healthier than if you lost the 50.and youll feel better too. uh and i doubt horse back riding will help. just dont over do anything just run maybe a 3 miles a week and slowly build up to about 5 then MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR CRUNCHES NO SIT UPS. sit ups kill your back in the long run and crunches have a more immediate effect and since your a female(no offense) do alot of cardio hurts like hell but it makes the femine body look sexy. hope it works even if it doesnt HOPE YOU DROP THE WEIGHT .glad to help.
jXwHiAaWaa	i think it differs from person to person. <br>  <br>  many people find that it doesn't help them, like my mum for instance. she believes that it is not right to look back into the past, only to power on into the future. <br>  <br>  i personally however don't think this is beneficial. i think if my mum explored her past, understanding her childhood and her dad's physicall abusive behaviour towards her, her loneliness in childhood etc and bullying, she might be able to be happier now and accept things more.<br>  <br>  for me, counselling has helped me to make sense of myself and flatten myself out; before i felt so scrumpled and confused. i think it can really aid you and make you feel better and more in touch with your emotions and help you to cope. it also provides a support during the week so if something happens you can go talk about it.<br>  <br>  it is also good for private problems you don't want to share with friends, for instance you might be questioning your sexuality but find it too embarrassing to talk to a friend or family member about that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  thats my opinion anyways! x<br>  <br>  <br>  (EDIT: stay on the waiting list for cbt, its amazing! i have both cbt and counselling and they work well for me together. hope it works out well for you and i think its cool what you're doing, i will do that too someday =]|`|WtMYXIvuaa	Hi, DEFINITELY!<br>  <br>  I have found it to be tremendously helpful in my own life.  Talking to a trained counsellor or psychologist helped me to identify and acknowledge my own problems and this paved the way for learning how to deal with them in an effective manner.  As a psychologist in training and someone who has sought the help of one myself, I could not recommend it more strongly.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|L3Tc39cuaa	hi, counselling....hmmmm. I've been to lots of counsellors. I think in general if the problem is quite specific counselling can help- eg childhood abuse,bereavement.However mental health can be very complex and can sometimes  be inter-twined with other specific issues.In this case i would say psychology ie cbt is much more helpful than straight foreward counselling. counselling can be helpful for some people though and probably everyone can take something positive from it even if it doesnt cure the problem. with your experience of mental health this will greatly help you understand and empathsise with clients.hope things go well 4 u. x|`|cku5S9WLaa	I had councelling when I was at college and I believe it helped me get through.

I think that talking about your feelings to a professional is very helpful.

Counselors help people with mental illness cope. I recommend counseling to everyone.|`|giyYxbo1aa	Counselling helps people in lots of ways but please take into account that a counsellor should not give advice - a counsellor should listen and ask questions and encourage the client to find their own solution.

Are you turning a bit blue around the mouth or are your hands taking on a bluish tint?<br>  <br>  Not breathing properly when you have the flu (and I'm assuming you mean influenza, not gastroenteritis) and asthma is to be expected.  However, if you really feel like you can't breathe properly after taking all of your inhalers, go see your doctor or go to a walk-in clinic.  They can listen to your lungs to determine if you're acquiring pneumonia or anything else, or they might prescribe you a new inhaler (like Atrovent) to take with your ventolin.<br>  <br>  Here's the WebMD page for pneumonia: <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/pneumonia-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/pneum...</a>  Remember, DO NOT try to self diagnose.

uiIhQljxaa	I guess I don't really know your doctor, his ways of working and relationship with yourself but, assuming these people are all at the same or similar highly professional levels, and the fact that he has already chosen a pharmaceutical as a treatment (and so seems unopposed to this kind of treatment plan) its probably similar to my doctor and most others.<br>  <br>  Just be honest, remember if it is your GP they are not neccesarily specialists in Psychiatry and Mental Health and it may be more effective to ask to be referred to (or visit a private) psychiatrist who may have more experience.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just be as relevant as possible, including as much detail as possible. I sometimes tried picking anecdotal examples of the kind of feelings and effects on my life it had, or anything I thought could help a doctor diagnose (patterns of behaviour, physiological side effects, sleep patterns and so on).<br>  <br>  Anti-depressants are accepted as effective, however each individual generally must try them on a trial and error basis until a correct one for them is found. Most would take several weeks at least to take full effect on chemical inbalances and so it's sometimes hard and tiring to do this, but hopefully a good experienced doctor would locate a most effective one as early as possible or first time.<br>  <br>  So basically I'd of thought it's well known amoungst doctors that sometimes it is neccesary to alter doses of medication further, and also may be neccesary to change medication and try other anti depressants. <br>  <br>  Mentioning the your suspicions of bipolar disorder may further help him decide on changing your treatment plan.<br>  <br>  Simply, your doctor is there to use what you tell him or any examinations he can perform (which sadly with depression is few to none) to make his diagnosis, and if you emphasise you really feel Fluoxetine (prozac) may not be working effectively on you, I see no reason to be worried whatever he does will be the best thing possible.<br>  <br>  Stick with his suggested treatment plans, or alternatively you could visit other doctors, maybe privately, if desired, for second opinions or to reinforce existing advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7uCfW237aa	Sounds a bit like bipolar.<br>  Stay away from prozac. There are so many negatives compared to the positives. It destroys all emotion, not just depression.<br>  Try to focus more on your diet and activity. Such as eating nuts and having a strict exercise regime.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.|`|gbj9Uoaaaa	Maybe mention to the Doctor that you have mood swings. He may put you on a stabiliser together with an anti-depressant for awhile until you level out. I can understand that you might like the highs but it seems that they don't last long yet the depression does. If you get diagnosed as Bi-Polar see if there is an M.D.F. Bi-polar meeting near you.|`|Z9Df2SYqaa	Just be totally honest with your doctor and tell him all the things you mentioned in your questions.  Write down everything and bring it with you to your doc appointment.  If you have some type of calendar or chart where you can track your feelings each day, it will be easy to show the doctor the patterns in your mood.<br>  <br>  You might want to get tested to see if you could have some sort of endocrine problem.  That high you feel could possibly be hormonal.  I would recommend you get complete bloodwork to rule out any other cause for your depression, making sure your hormone levels are getting tested, and especially your thyroid.  Just to make sure.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|LGkb4xibaa	i was prescribed prozak when i was younger and it was the worst months of my life. So personally i'd ask your dr for a new medication as your having adverse side effects from it.<br>  <br>  You may have bi- polar, but its not a guarantee.

Eating half a leaf of fresh sage combined with 1/8 a teaspoon of turmeric spice will greatly reduce the drainage and congestion; about as well as the pharmaceutical medications (and without their side effects). You should make your body alkaline to boost its uptake of oxygen. Drinking homemade lemonade with a pinch of baking soda periodically is a fast, safe, and effective way of doing this. Lemon juice is an acid, but it makes the body more alkaline because of the way it gets processed. The baking soda will add buffering bicarbonates to make the body resistive to becoming acidic again, which is the normal state during sickness. None of these things will provide immediate relief for the throat pain. That requires time. <br>  To to treat the pain (and most effectively kill the bacteria) use a small amount of cayenne pepper with 3% hydrogen peroxide in a gargle. Sea salt is also fine to add. The remedies mentioned in previous answers really are effective, but not as fast. Your body will very rapidly deplete its iodine reserves anytime you are sick, so I recommend adding a quarter-sized patch of 2% iodine on your skin once a day, and more often if it absorbs rapidly. A couple of drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide in each ear periodically is helpful too. Even drinking a tiny amount of it in a drink will give your body a tremendous boost.<br>  If the condition lasts longer than a week, and has blisters, then it is most likely a strep germ. In this case, the condition will merit pharmaceutical antibiotics because strep germs can go into remission and silently attack the heart. There are powerful holistic treatments such as colloidal silver, which I would also recommend in conjunction with the antibiotics. Strep germs are too dangerous to not hit them with everything you can.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	Have a bath and then a nap.<br>  If you are generally in pain then I would suggest to have some paracetamol and call your doctor on advice.<br>  Stop thinking about it because it sometimes makes it worst.<br>  Stay in bed tomorrow and have the day off.<br>  Take care|`|AA10877025	It'll go in time how about trying something warm like a hot water bottle by your throat to ease the pain.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	i really do not know. please go to the dr and get tested for strep (bacteriAl) and mono (viral)|`|uiIhQljxaa	some sore throats can be awful, however you may have developped tonselitis if it becoming hard or painful to swallow.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|6NZeItMAaa	When on a diet change the fruits and veggies by those that you like as there is not a big difference in calories.<br>  <br>  Potatoes are good as long as they are not fried, you can boil them and spread some herbs to make them taste good.<br>  <br>  This way you'll have a personal diet that you will be able to follow.<br>  <br>  Think of this as a lifestyle change and not a diet! Your overall goal is to become healthier.<br>  <br>  Surround yourself with positive, supportive people.<br>  <br>  Do not be hard on yourself if you slip!<br>  <br>  You will lose weight quicker in the beginning. And you may end up hitting a plateau. It happens. Try changing up your diet and exercise routine.<br>  <br>  Start your nutrition plan by eating smaller portions.<br>  <br>  Instead of completely eliminating a food item, find a replacement. For example, instead of white bread, eat whole wheat instead. You are still eating bread, but one that is healthier for you.|`|CE4K7kQvaa	Homeopathic Remedies for Obesity - Corpulence and Fatness (Without any side effects or Complications) :-<br>  <br>  OBESITY(Corpulence) along with :-<br>  <br>  Tongue thickly white coated; patient feels exhausted in warm water Antim Crud 200, 6 hourly <br>  <br>  With unusual tallness in children; chilly patient Silicea 30X or 30, 4 hourly <br>  <br>  When the tongue is constantly whitish coated; with liver disorders Kali Mur 30 or 6X, 4 hourly <br>  <br>  Fat, flabby and chilly patients.

When I started  in 1971  50p per day was enough to by 5 Bristol Tips cigarettes and yes they sold them in packs of 5 and a filled roll and coke for lunch. Several years later I gave up smoking due to pregnancy it was 65p a pack of 20 -16 years later I started smoking again due to stress, then once again I became addicted to them I never care what the tobacco company thinks, I think how stupid I am to have started again because it is harder to give up smoking than it is to stop using heroin. It now costs me almost ￡8 per day for cigarettes, I have went on a bit but the past cant be changed its the future we need to change and hopefully the young people reading this will think before they have that first cigarette to make them look coll/hard etc it only makes them look stupid.|`|ETqZU5D9aa	I used to smoke because when I was stationed in Korea all my friends smoked and since we drank a lot (almost every day) I would drunkenly try them and I got hooked from there.

I used to smoke and I admit I started because my friends were trying it, I was only a young, daft teenager and didn't know the implications at the time but once you're hooked you smoke because you are addicted and it's extremely difficult to stop, it has nothing to do with 'hype' or anything else, you just need it. Stopping is the best thing I ever did but it wasn't statements like yours that made me stop or the health risks to myself, it was my son being diagnosed with a serious illness that did it.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	I was told that second hand smoke was worse than actually smoking.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.
c041cf42cbef03916007536215ce6e9faa	My Sympathies to you and Your Nan.. This is indeed a troubling time. Chemo kills all good things in your body and in fact destroys all Antibodies to fight off infections. Your Nan may have contracted some sort of Virus, whether that be Flu, Cold, etc. and since her Immune System is compromised due to the Chemo her body cannot fight it. Here are some Common Side Effects of Chemotherapy:<br>  <br>  Chemotherapy doesn't only target cancer cells, but any cells that divide rapidly. This includes those in the bone marrow and skin, hair-producing cells, and the cells that line the mouth and digestive system. Damage to these healthy cells during chemotherapy may produce various side-effects, including:<br>  <br>      * tiredness<br>      * feeling sick and vomiting<br>      * diarrhoea or constipation<br>      * loss of appetite<br>      * loss of hair<br>      * getting infections more easily<br>      * sore mouth, mouth ulcers and changes to your sense of taste<br>      * numbness or "pins and needles" in your hands and feet<br>      * changes in hearing - some people get tinnitus (a ringing sound in the ears)<br>      * skin changes - skin may become dry and discoloured<br>  <br>  Most chemotherapy side-effects are temporary and will eventually pass once the treatment is completed. It's important to weigh up the benefits of chemotherapy against the risks of side-effects.<br>  <br>  Many of the side-effects can be controlled using other medicines. For example, sickness can be reduced using anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medicines.<br>  <br>  Tiredness is the most common side-effect of chemotherapy treatment, and it can last a long time. This may be frustrating because you will feel tired even if you are resting. Most people get back to their normal energy levels within about six months, but it can take longer<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking Nan to her Doctor as soon as possible and letting the DR know what all the symptoms are. She may be experiencing Extremely Low Blood Counts.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|HumMEMu5aa	I you were promised that someone would come and see your Nan - and they haven't - phone IMMEDIATELY.<br>  <br>  I agree with the person who said to comment on suing - unless you live in Britain, when best thing is to get on to the local Primary Care Trust (PCT), or else Director of Nursing of the hospital treating your Nan.<br>  <br>  It's no use talking - get your Mum to contact hospital.<br>  <br>  It is an extraordinary thing - we all look on doctors, nurses and hospitals as doing a wonderful job, and don't like to complain.  I go on the Choices pages of our National Health Websites, and see patient comments "would you recommend this hospital?" they answer YES - then you read down and find they have had dreadful experiences - yet there is still this myth that you mustn't complain.<br>  <br>  Forgive this rant.  I am devoted to my wonderful doctors, but to find them I had to swop from some dreadful ones.  I wrote about them on www.after-cancer.com - not much use to your Nan at the moment, but let's hope she gets better, and then you can go on the website and find out how I found really good treatment, and what things might bring a smile to her face.<br>  <br>  You sound a very sensible person - keep up with the good work!<br>  <br>  And good luck<br>  <br>  Verite R|`|SQLSOeHcaa	I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR NAN:-(<br>  <br>  CHEMO IS PAINFUL...I LOST 2 BROTHERS TO CANCER AND I SAW WHAT CHEMO DOES!<br>  BUT THERE ARE MEDICATIONS TO HELP WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS...BUT STILL...YOU GET PRETTY ILL (ESPECIALLY THE FIRST 2 DAYS).<br>  PLEASE BE ON TOP OF THINGS, DON'T RELY ON NURSES CALLING YOU BACK, (IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM THEM) COMPLAIN AND CALL THE HOSPITAL, AND IF YOU THINK SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT, CALL THE DOCTOR.<br>  THERE IS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD BE SUFFERING MORE THAN SHE HAS TO...MY BROTHERS WERE IN PAIN DURING CHEMO....

Its not all doom and gloom though i,ve seen it work a few times and sure theres a chance your nan could be back to herself in a few months and i hope she is.<br>                                      As for the hospital and nurses...i got the feeling they werent doing enough to help but in hindsight i think when its your loved one in there its everything to you but these nurses and doctors have seen it a million times and i,m not saying they dont do their job correctley but your really just a number to them. <br>  <br>  I know its hard but keep your chin up ;)
F4DhYjlnaa	Yes, the pain was probably your hymen either breaking or stretching. You may have had enough room to get a penis through your hymen from the get-go. The pain could also just be your vagina being opened up fully for the first time. Although you didn't bleed, it is lined with capilaries & nerves that might receive that first penetration signal as pain. It could be that your hymen just stretched, and didn't tear, that's why no blood. Every woman is built differently.|`|brkSlMzsaa	Was the pain my hymen breaking?<br>  No first time sex can be painful as it is the first time something that big has entered you.

(:|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	Well, no one can give you a definitive answer, really. <br>  <br>  The pain may have been your hymen breaking, it also could have been from lack of lubrication, or from not being used to being stretched so far. <br>  <br>  You may or may not have bled if your hymen had broken. Usually there is at least a little bit of bleeding, but you might not have noticed it. <br>  <br>  It could have been broken before, especially if you've been fingered, use tampons, masturbate, or have taken part in any vigorous activity.
AA11593971	Are you taking any new medications... especially those with hormones in them, like the Pill? Hormone imbalances can cause night sweats.<br>  <br>  Are you prone to hypoglycemia... low blood sugar? That can cause sweats at any time, but is common at night when you go for a long time without eating. Try having a snack before bedtime. Peanut butter and crackers is a good one.

RMmh0aimaa	Are you going to the gym to loose weight? If so, then this may not be the best way. Also could be the case of looking fat if you are taking too much weight gain powder stuff - another issue may be the style of your workouts.<br>  <br>  You can work out to get lean, or to bulk up. To bulk up you do heavy weights and a small number of reps per set. To get lean muscle you need to do smaller weights and a high number of reps per set.|`|eFW5O92Yaa	Chances are it's just muscle mass, even if it may look like fat. Just keep your routine. If your doing a professional one, where you work out certain groups each day for 3 days, then repeat the 3 days, then rest one day, and are using heavy weights. You may want to switch it up every so often, use heavy weights for a while then surprise your muscles by hitting a bunch of light weights one day with high reps and more sets. This will help burn some of the fat on top of the muscle groups, making them more defined. But overall, I wouldn't worry about it. Hope this helped.|`|oBPYwFe5aa	try more cardiovascular exersises, (running machine, rowing machine, cross trainer) , having a longer steady workout on these will help to burn fat at a higher rate, the longer you work, the more fat you burn, short intese exersises do not work as well<br>  <br>  if your finding the gym a waste of money, try running up and down stairs or a few mile jog?|`|Yo7CNsq8aa	your most likely buff not fat . .<br>  thats sexy .) keep it up !

And it WONT effect your metabolism later in life, that kids an idiot. <br>  <br>  if u wanna gain muscle u need to take in about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight daily. So take one shake right after u work out, and more through out the day, if u can afford to do that.

However i do kno that taking basically any supplements to build muscle will affect your metabolism in later life|`|tw3Uzn1Caa	For protein it really depends on how much you want to take.  I know people that take protein three times a day, when they wake up, after they work out, and before they go to bed.  I have personally taken protein before and i only took it after i worked out.  They say if you are going to only take it once take it after you work out.  and the protein i had, which might be the same that you are taking, had 52g of protein in 2 scoops and that is what i took directly after i worked out!|`|Cn70dwABaa	Supplements aren't cheating, steroids are and the questioner isn't asking about steroids!!<br>  <br>  Basically just make sure you have a protein shake after exercise and continue eating lots of little meals throughout the day. But don't neglect carbohydrates as they compliment gains..The amino acids break down the protein. <br>  <br>  So in an essence after you've came out of the gym drink the shake, if you go twice a day drink two shakes a day. I used to drink a Glucose drink before then protein afterwards. That works well.
GWscPQ5caa	What you′ve written sounds really good, almost too good to be true!<br>   If you wanna hear my advice then I think you should variate your workout a bit that will say not only gym. <br>  <br>  Try out aerobics or just go out and walk for 30 minutes ( regular-walking or powerwalk)  a couple of times in a week<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|J4cSgIreaa	First of all you are only 14 and need to be careful about under eating and too much exercise because you are still growing and need sufficient foods to help you grow and stay healthy.<br>  <br>  I am 23 years old and i now weigh 13st 4 a uk size 16, however 5 weeks ago i weighed 14st 4lb, so i lost a stone in that time scale but i am older and have a lot of fat to lose due to having children and letting myself go a bit. I am on a diet where i eat low calorie meals (plenty of fruit and veg), take regular exercise and drink plenty of water.<br>  <br>  You need to be in control of the foods you are eating and not snack or pick at "junk food". Make sure you always eat breakfast, lunch and dinner do not skip meals as this does not aid weight loss and your body will begin to store fat instead of burning it. If, however you find u are stuill hungry in between make yourself smaller regular meals throughout the day e.g breakfast, lunch, late afternoon, dinner and tea.<br>  <br>  It is important to not veg on the couch and to stay active and make sure you drink plenty of water (recommended at least 8 glasses a day) as we often mistake hunger for thirst and drink a glass of water or sugar free soft drink/fizz with your meals to help fill up your belly and stop you over eating.<br>  <br>  I am concerned that you are soo young and i think for you to be aiming to lose four stone is a little high, set yourself goals that are realistic in the first place and you are more likely to succeed. Set a goal of 1 stone and when you reach that if you still want to lose more weight then set a new goal. You might be suprised and realise that you dont need to lose as much as 4 stone after all.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ipL7L5WSaa	if you really keep at, you probably can. make sure you still get exercise on the days you dont go to the gym.|`|inI1fkx7aa	Cutting back on snacking is good, as is regulating portions.  Make sure you're eating healthy as well as reasonably sized... one apple is NOT a meal.  If you need to snack, snack on good foods that will contribute to your daily dietary needs.<br>  <br>  You could probably lose most of that weight, but I think you're going to end up only at about 3, because 4 would bring you down below what most bodies your height need.<br>  <br>  I'd aim for 3 and be happy if you get any more.  3 should put you well within a healthy range for your height and weight without meaning that you have to starve yourself.|`|vwm0uFoCaa	I recommend you join www.30bananasaday.com<br>  <br>  They are a great community and will help you immensely with what you want and how to do it in a healthy way.|`|NjD1MJd3aa	yeah its possible<br>  if you need to snack have an apple<br>  i wouldnt aim to lose 4 stone i would aim to lose inch's<br>  because you will gain muscle<br>  muscle weighs more than fat
bssOhC9jaa	NO? wow that person has no idea. RA can go into remission (suppressed) with the right meds. DMARDS with a NSAID (naproxen, clinirol, indocen) and other meds will help. She can take Arava, Imuran, or other DMARDs with Remecade, Humira, Embrel, Rituxan, Orencia, Kineret or the Actemra comeing out some time this year. Have her talk to her doctor and see which will work for her. It will be a rollercoaster. It took me 4 years to find a combination that works.

bxxwhP04aa	This is most likely a chronic problem that cannot be cured, but can be treated.  I suggest getting a gadget to smooth out the rough edges, these gadgets can be found on drug stores, or thru Avon.  They look like a nail file somewhat.  You would rub these gently over the rough areas, doing it several times a week.  Then use a good foot cream at night, wearing socks over your feet while you sleep.  Flexitil makes a good foot cream.  I would suggest Flexitol Medicated.  It has an anti-fungal ingredient in it that will kill any possible fungus on your feet.  Flakiness does suggest a fungal problem.  Flexitol makes two different kinds, be sure to get the one that is medicated.  Walmart sells this in their foot care section.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. If you have tried the different mostirizers/foot products I would go to a Podiatrist. Good luck & peace
0KaadzHzaa	Um so why did you go to the hospital for an anxiety attack anyways? That is if you have a history of it and you know that's what it is. I actually never understand why people go to the hospital for an anxiety attack. Just go to a dark room, slow your breathing down, wind down and let it end. That is all that EMS or the hospital will do for you. Also no one is trying to make you "conform". They asked you some of those questions like "have you ever hit a dog" etc as part of a psychological evaluation. They are trying to figure out if you are just having an anxiety attack and not having other problems going on like hallucinations. They also asked to make sure you are not homicidal or suicidal.<br>  So I am sorry if this does not sound very nice. but maybe next time you should stop being so damn paranoid and let the EMS and hospital staff help you. No one is judging you. Hell honestly no one really cares, you are most like likely 1 of the hundreds of the many neurotic patients they will see that day.|`|uGQnNQg7aa	It's not that we are rude/judgemental.  It's that we are underpayed, overworked and just plain as tired or sick or whatever as some of the patients we see, but no one wants to hear us whine or complain either.  It's hard to hear someone comlain of a headache when I am on hour 11 of a 12 or 18 hour shift and I too have a HA and haven't eaten or went pee in hours.  So next time maybe people should understand a little of healthcare workers.

tIldpr7vaa	if ur looking to gain muscle u need to take in about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight daily, so 170 grams a day<br>  <br>  u should take the protein shakes everyday, u build muscle while ur muscle are resting, not during a workout|`|yhjoTuHzaa	Yes. Although athletes require a little more protein than the rest of us, it is almost impossible not to get enough protein in your diet if you live in the States. You want to take any where from 30- 35% of your calories from protein. No more. 40 from carbohydrates and no more than 30 from fat is the rule too.<br>  <br>  If you really want to be in the know, pick up Nutrition for Dummies. It's a great reference guide to correct nutrition.

FyVdQKIBaa	I've been through dozens of eye drops and the only one that seems to work for me is Rohto Ice, from Walgreen's. It's about 7 bucks - and when you use it, at first it hurts and stings like hell - but it does work - and it usually takes 5 minutes to kick in. Closing your eyes for 60 seconds usually helps after applying a drop.<br>  <br>  Though ReNu saline solution poured into my eye is also soothing. Using too many non-saline eye drops at once sometimes adds more crude to the lenses - and ReNu clears it all out.

Having them on for that long won't do any harm.<br>  <br>  The big question is have they been adjusted? If the haven't been adjusted then the time that they have been on has mostly been wasted. You need to get braces regularly adjusted in order to move the teeth. If they were fitted 17 months ago and haven't been adjusted for 15 months then she's still only 2 months into her routine, and the last 15 months haven't been worth anything.<br>  <br>  Why hasn't she had them removed?|`|RgniB1DLaa	I have had braces. I hated them. I wore them for a year and then my dentist said they didn't do anything so I had to keep them on for another year. It won't cause any damage, if it was pushing her teeth to the right though, they might start leaning to the right instead of being straight.|`|aVPd5uBWaa	eventually it will...especially if she doesn't have continuous treatment. She will have to start her treatment all over again because without tightening, her teeth will begin to shift again.|`|5GcmU8gNaa	No they wont damage her teeth but if she is not getting them tightened then it wont make a difference to her teeth so then there is no point in having them on.
ToILKl6waa	First and foremost, try to cut down on foods with high sugar and caffeine. Make sure you get an adequate amount of sleep and exersize during the day.<br>  <br>  Realizing you have anxiety is the first step. Anxiety is only a normal physical response to stress. But when you get the feeling, do not reply to your body with - "NO ANXIETY! NOT NOW - GO AWAY!" Instead welcome and encourage the anxiety, as if it is inferior to you. Science proves that if you do so, the anxiety will not mount. Also, if a stressful situation or thing is giving you anxiety, keep confronting the fear. The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll feel. Understand that anxiety is physically harmless. It's just a feeling inside you. A feeling does not define who you are.|`|8jK33jK1aa	I would suggest seeing a therapist.  There are many safe medications that can help you and your doctor/therapist can prescribe.

be09a22e45d965eb9be079d5c83a498caa	I've been doing a lot of research on diet and exercise over the last few weeks as I prepare to get into bike riding shape for the summer. One of the things I knew beforehand, and that has been reaffirmed through much of my research, is that the key to everything is balance. Keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  I'd be less concerned about carbs in general than I would in sugars and the types being consumed. For example, there is "processed" wheat bread and whole wheat bread. While whole wheat bread actually is higher in carbohydrates, more of it is in the form of dietary fiber, which the body will just expel, making the net carbs from whole wheat substantially lower than that of processed wheat.<br>  <br>  Really, what you should be looking for is natural sugars vs refined sugars. Your body is designed to efficiently use natural sugars while it tends to store refined or "processed" sugars. For example, a glass of fruit juice may have just as many calories as a soda, but because the fruit juice is sweetened by unrefined sugars, it can use these sugars quickly and efficiently and tends not to store them, whereas a soda is filled with processed/refined sugars which the body will store as fat.<br>  <br>  So, what I would recommend is doing a little research about what foods contain "good" carbs and which ones contain "bad" carbs, and concentrate more on the eating of the former rather than counting the total carbs, because that figure can be misleading. <br>  <br>  The resource below has some good information and a few good, solid links at the bottom that give some detail concerning carbs.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Stop making it so hard on yourself, while you may lose weight doing this once you're off it you will pack on over 10 pounds more than you lost. <br>  <br>  Make a switch you can live with the rest of your life. 1600 is fine. you must exercise 1 hour a day 3 -6 times a week though for weight loss.

UgFntgI9aa	I think it's normal to have anxiety as a response of having to deal with changes in your routine.  I think people are basically adapted, by default, to staying with their own group, not roving around amongst crowds of strangers.  But modern life imposes the necessity on us, and so we have anxiety, the modern disease. <br>  <br>  I'm not a big fan of taking drugs to deal with it. I think with time and experience you either develop the subjective techniques to adapt and deal with anxiety, or you become a pill dependent, interminable neurotic.  <br>  <br>  Subjective techniques might mean anything, really. You live inside your head, nobody else does.  You're the one that can figure out how to calm yourself down. By trial and error, persistent introspection, prayer, whatever it takes is good if you ask me. <br>  <br>  I do think it's a good idea to ask yourself as many hard questions as you can think of.  <br>  <br>  Things like, what exactly is it you're afraid of?  What's the worst thing you think might happen?  Are your problems terribly awful compared to those of other people?  Does it make sense to be afraid of things you can't do anything about?  Do you have the slightest idea what you're trying to do in this place anyway? And so on.

eFW5O92Yaa	Well, when you say you lose all strength to go back up, it sounds like you may need to go lighter if you can. But other excercises to work your legs could be a lot of things. You could do leg flexions(calf & hamstring), leg extentions(quads), Calf raises(calf & sides of lower leg), or lunges(pretty much all of the leg). If you can get access to the weights to do these excercises, they can be just as good as squats.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Consider using egg substitutes (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort.

The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|1UervvWtaa	losing weight may be harder if you don't eat fruit or drink water, because you can use them as a low cal and fat way of filling up but to lose weight you need to eat 500 cals less that your daily intake, hope that helps :D x
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|jw6OjQkEaa	dont eat any more ok for u?|`|V1XNY519aa	run and build muscle. like chest and stuff. the upper boy there ya go. <br>  and eat healthy. or healthier.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Consider using egg substitutes (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you.

A blocked intestine or an inflamed appendix can become very serious if not diagnosed and treated.|`|AA12071759	This is something that is impossible to answer over the internet.

AA10609839	Running causes an increase in circulation of blood. Too much of it rushes to your head which can cause the headaches.  A lot of people get them.  Maybe after running you should slowly slow down by walking.|`|AbAHhcwiaa	yes i get them all the time after i run or jump, some people have headaches from the sun or after being active its normal|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Well, you're probably didn't drink anything sweet after running. You need to drink or eat something sweet as you need the sugar to not get dehydrate.|`|Vmt7ylcuaa	One case is not enough to make a rush conclusion.<br>  If you repeat run for a mile and again you undergo headache, then you must go to a doctor.|`|087c14ef810cae54ec446439f9012410aa	yes because the way you ran, or you are not use to it, most likely the way you ran the mile.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	You are most likely dehydrated.

I know what you're talking about, though. I'm pretty sure people are just born with them and they can't be removed (it's part of your tooth, after all).
9yPEjN4Xaa	This could really be a wide range of issues. You could have low blood sugar or maybe it could be a reaction to a medication or any sort of stimulant such as caffeine. <br>  <br>  Do you experience any pain in your muscles or joints?<br>  <br>  Are you more tired than you used to be?<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to see a doctor who can run some standard test. Test your blood sugar and thyroid and if all else fails you may want to see a neurologist. <br>  <br>  Sometimes when you notice a change in your body you can become hyperaware of other issues you have and it can cause a panic. <br>  <br>  When we walk with someone and we are busy talking or just enjoying their company we do tend to sway in and out from that person and often bump into them. I don't mean to minimize your worries. Instead I think it's a good idea to try and stay calm and not make too much out of what you're experiencing. Just take one step at a time. <br>  <br>  Make an appointment with a doctor and go from there. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	See a doctor for blood tests. You need free t3 and free T4 to check for hyperthyroidism. The tremors and muscle wasting are symptoms of hyperthyroidism.|`|5ekbXw9saa	Lay off the crack! Lol im kidding.

L0Quyt1Gaa	Counting calories would be best. Find out your resting metabolism and eat that much.

Try low sugar, like corn flakes or Cheerios.<br>  Oatmeal is good too.<br>  You can eat some tuna, low fat and high in protein.|`|d60b2ed5d84ce4bd6e37b1cec230d050aa	i probably eat that much but i dont really count calories either. i just eat when i get hungry, eating as little as possible may not be healthy, especially if your not getting all of the nutrition that you need.<br>  its best to eat 6 small meals a day rather than 3 large ones. but at your age your probably still growing, so its hard to say what or how much you should eat.<br>  if your trying to lose weight, walking is a good exercise to start out with, its easy and effective.

They have all sorts of flavors, a big portion size, for 100 calories.|`|g3SmAP9Eaa	It all depends on what you put on the popcorn. The popcorn itself is moderately healthy. However the addition of sugar/ salt/ butter makes it an unhealthy food.<br>  The healthiest option is to eat popcorn plain, although that can be boring! Avoid artificial sweeteners, as these can damage internal organs.|`|WDLnNm7Maa	Yess it is good for you, but you need to get 100 calories or no butter.

6K1D6Azmaa	Whether you are allergic to a particular earring material will not be affected by gems that may be on them. <br>  <br>  People often develop more allergies as they grow older. A serious illness sometimes seems to be a trigger.  <br>  <br>  You did not say what other earring materials you investigated. I suggest you try to find earrings you can wear before you try to wear a nose ring again. Try titanium. ?

Keep up the treatment regularly otherwise it's pointless - it's not going to work overnight.<br>  There is also a product - quite pricey - called Dermastine which is excellent. I don't know if it's available in your country. It is know as the Poor Man's La Mer! Usually available at good dermatologists and better pharmacies. <br>  Rapid weight gain and loss contributed to stretch marks. Drink 2 litres of water a day, and do the oil rubs morning and evening.

It's mostly about genetics - check out the women in your family and see how theirs look. However, you should use a good lotion every day, and especially apply in that area after every shower. This will help minimize their appearance. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, every woman has them. It is a sign that you are becoming a woman! Even friends of mine who didn't get particularly big hips during high school got them. They fade as you get older & are barely noticeable. I am 32 and they don't bother me one bit.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.|`|RZ72YJGCaa	Eat healthy fats like:<br>  <br>  Peanuts<br>  Fish<br>  Olives<br>  Avocados<br>  Soy Milk<br>  Red Meat<br>  <br>  :)|`|EDMAqIcBaa	how about in between meals you have snacks like cereal bars or toast<br>  just try to eat a bit more often<br>  you can still eat alot and be healthy<br>  like pasta, bread, tuna, chicken, beans, nuts, seeds..<br>  theese all help you put on weight while staying healthy and there all really nice!|`|3fa42e1d5f13f37e2ec069fe32521d2caa	Milkshakes!

There are many different kinds and one is bound to agree with you. I can't drink milk either, or eat ice cream, but the processing of yogurt and cheeses makes them agree with me. Also, look for orange juice and other foods that are calcium enriched. There are quite a few because kids drink so much soda instead of milk it is a problem. Learn to read labels and go on the net or ask a dietitian for a list of calcium rich foods.

RMmh0aimaa	Hmm, I'm not a doctor so perhaps you should get some professional advice also.<br>  <br>  It is a good thing that it popped back in place straight away. I bet it was painful. The pain you are experiencing now is the shock of the muscle being stretched beyond what it is used to. The pain behind your knee is probably the posterior and anterior cruciate ligaments which hold the knee joint together - they probably got a little stretched too.<br>  <br>  The longer anything is dislocated for the worse off you will be.<br>  <br>  I once dislocated my wrist when I got electrocuted in the back of a TV set. Luckily I managed to put it back in place myself with a little force and a lot of pain right there on the spot. I got a ganglion as a result of the trauma to the area which hung around for a year or so after. I went to a doctor after it happened and they told me I did a good job. ;)
IgztWp0uaa	You could have an ear infection (which means go to the doctor for antibiotics), a viral infection that will clear on its own, or perhaps it is plugged with wax. You can try one of those wax removal kits that you can get at the drug store if the wax impaction isn't too great, otherwise you may need to go to an ENT to have it evaluated and removed safely. <br>  Wax impaction can be an issue if you use q-tips improperly.
Nq4FWEIcaa	I tossed this question around with some male friends a couple weeks ago as my doctor suggested I should get circumcised for health reasons.  All of my friends are circumcised and said that they would still make that choice if they were not and that if they had sons they would choose that for them also.  I have one friend who told me not to get circumcised even tho he was.  He said that losing out on the extra sexual sensations that an uncircumcised man has is too much of a sacrifice and that I only should do it if I contracted cancer.  He said he had never seen an uncircumcised adult penis before so I showed him mine.  He said it was not as attractive as a circumcised penis but that he still wishes he had his foreskin.  I asked my best friend if he would answer some very personal questions about his penis and how he feels pleasure, ejaculations, intercourse and oral sex, etc.  He is circumcised.  And while many of those sexual things we both experience were described in the same fashion, I still had the impression he did not fully experience the sexual stimulations I did because I still have my foreskin.  He agreed that was probably so but since he was circumcised since birth, that the sexual sensations he feels through his penis was good enough for him.  I live in the U.S. where almost all guys are circumcised and I do get many glances when I walk into a locker room.  Most guys have never seen an uncircumcised penis and are curious when they see mine.  I have answered many questions about my penis to the guys who walk up to me and ask "what's up with your dick?"  I guess I will keep my foreskin until there is a need to have it removed,|`|RMmh0aimaa	Keep the skin. I think it was once upon a time cut off for health reasons - ie infections or something? I don't see the need for cutting it off anymore. It's really quite gross. Like cutting of a dogs tail - they don't do that anymore either.<br>  <br>  For the record I have never had any infections and I am grateful for the added protection - I imagine it would be quite painful without seeing as it is a most sensitive area.|`|nA1g26y0aa	I am circumcised, and I love it! I have several friends who have chosen to get their penises circumcised later in life (in their early 20's and 30's) for medical and personal reasons. I think that the look of a "cut" dick is so much more beautiful. Of course, if when a guy gets hard, and his foreskin is short enough to "naturally" pull back so it LOOKS as if he is cut, that's cool too.<br>  <br>  The guys I know who have chosen to have this procedure done (their parents didn't do it when they were infants), they like being cut vs. uncut.|`|qTkiOSL3aa	I'm circumcised. From what I heard its only done for hygiene issues. I would of liked to not be circumcised and make the decision later in life as I grow older. That's what I wish for my son (if I have one).|`|TsjqzanQaa	As an infant, I was tied down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by the process called circumcision.<br>  <br>  Because of the damage inflicted on me, I sustained more than the usual (50-75%) loss of sexual sensitivity, which made it impossible for me to reach orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  I didn't know what was wrong with me for years, and didn't attribute my sexual problem to circumcision, until I finally found out about foreskin restoration.<br>  <br>  This has given me vastly improved sexual sensitivity and function, and increased the intensity of orgasm, as well.<br>  <br>  Women who advocate circumcision and perpetrate it on their sons should get a female circumcision done to themselves to see how THEY like being scarred, mutilated and deprived of sexual sensitivity for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  "It looks better?"    I have heard that one so often, and usually it comes from people who have never even actually seen a penis with a foreskin.      In Europe, Scandinavia, South America and Asia, the circumcised penis looks ugly and scarred to people who are used to seeing a normal and natural penis.<br>  <br>  "To look like daddy?"      My own father was unmutilated, and I never even gave it a throught until after he was dead, and I found out what circumcision had done to me.      Now, I wish I could have asked him why he had me mutilated as an infant, when he himself was intact.<br>  <br>  "It's cleaner."     This silly old-wive's tale is so ridiculous.<br>  In most of the world men are uncircumcised, and I never heard of a foreskin killing anyone, but I've heard of deaths resulting from circumcision.      Obviously, from the birth rates in other countries that don't mutilate infants' penises, the ones with a foreskin function very well.<br>  <br>  "It prevents diseases and infections"    This has been completely disproven.     The latest research shows that the foreskin of the intact male has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.    The USA has had a very high rate of circumcision, and also the highest rate of HIV of any western industrialized country.        Pakistan, where about 90% of males are circumcised, has an HIV rate 400% greater than that of neighboring India, where the vast majority of males are unmutilated.<br>  <br>  STD rates are also lower with unmutilated males.<br>  <br>  Doctors never disclose the adverse effects and complications that result from circumcision, and in fact suppress them.     They NEVER address the issues of diminished sexual sensitivity nor the psychological implications of males discovering that they were mutilated.       Most doctors themselves are circumcised, and they make money from circumcision, and frequently belong to the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  Very, very few men ever choose to be circumcised.<br>  The vast majority of circumcised men had it forced on them as infants, when they couldn't choose for themselves, and couldn't defend themselves against the assault and mutilation.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|44BEm1Uhaa	I am chopped,all the problems I read about foreskin hurting people like hell,I would recommend the chop treatment...I know a 47 year old male who got chopped shortly after marrying a sexy 31 year old...She was killing the poor dude...hehe|`|K4zsztkRaa	I wouldn't ever circumcise my son.

Instead, I would let him grow up and then decide what he wants to do.|`|FI916ISFaa	There is absolutely no medical reason to routinely circumcise infants.

I have known a few that had it done later in life for what ever reason it was up to them. I do know that the end of the penis is very sensitive, removing the foreskin and i think would be somewhat painful but again this would be your choice. We had to have our son circumcised at about 3 or 4 years of age do to some lack of knowledge back then. My understanding is that with it removed they have the ability to last longer. But I also think if  a guy and his wife /gf can work with each other he can last just as long.

ToILKl6waa	Too much pornography is when it starts interfering with his social and love life. <br>  <br>  Most men watch porn, but if you feel he's overdoing it, try to get his attention about the issue and tell him you think it would be best for both him and the relationship if he cut down the porn time a bit. Tell him you'll support him and reward him on days where he refuses porn to pleasure him. Give it time - habits come and go, but he must be willing to let it go.|`|83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	Try showing him statistics on how often males his age do it.  <br>  <br>  I think it's only once a week.  Not Daily, or several times a day.<br>  <br>  Sex is physical work!  You also have to take the effort to ensure that your partner's needs are satisfied.<br>  <br>  When using porn- he only has to care about himself, do it with less physical excursion.  Also- those woman have no needs he has to care about... they are also the idealized form... and faraway from what reality is.<br>  <br>  It's very alluring.  His basic biological needs satisfied in the most efficient way possible- why would he want to have sex more often?<br>  <br>  There are several factors here- each small by themselves, but all adding up to the lack of sex:<br>  <br>  1.)Porn and self pleasure more efficient, less physically and mentally cumbersome <br>  2.)If you have been together for going on 2 years, this is the "normal' time for you to slow down sexually.  This time frame is the same with all couples married or not... two years start from the first time you were active with each other sexually.<br>  3.)If he has been at this for a while, he might have "retrained" himself. Human sexuality has a lot to do with mental stimulation- it is often said that people have sex with their brains... What use to stimulate him, how he got there, the mental process, and physical sensations are no longer the same.  It's now instant gratification, no warm up, no seduction, the physical feeling is different too.  He might have been re-programing himself to respond to porn, rather then a human, and might find it harder to achieve the same thing with a person.<br>  4.)Porn it's self is sexuality distilled.  Like a drug.  Its a high concentration of all that stimulation- and real like pales in comparison.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are dangers with that much masturbation.  If you go at it - every day, for years on end, it's possible to suffer nerve damage- and he will find it more and more difficult to have sex the regular way.<br>  <br>  Nothing will get better until he realizes there is a problem, otherwise he will just perceive it as nagging.<br>  <br>  Put some fear into him.  Let him know that #1  his frequency is not normal for other men his age(who have a partner), #2 he can cause damage to himself physically and sexually to where there only time he can reach orgasm is with masturbation, and after enough time- he can cause so much damage that even that will be closed to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  some articles that tie into what I had mentioned:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.actionlove.com/cases/case12625.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.actionlove.com/cases/case1262...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazines.com/article_detail.cfm/322503?articleid=322503&title=penis%2Cmasterbation%2Csex%2Ctherapy%2Csexual%2Cdysfunction" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazines.com/article_detail.c...</a><br>  <br>  <br>   Please understand that his disinterests in sex does not mean he no longer loves you.<br>  <br>  Woman and men do not view sex and love in the same way.<br>  <br>  Sex is one thing,, Love is another.<br>  <br>  In a committed relationship when each love each other:<br>  <br>  For a woman, sex is an expression of love.<br>  For a man, it's sex with someone he loves.|`|qyprvmfhaa	Well, maybe if you feel there is a problem with your sex life, you can talk to him and maybe see a sex therapist. <br>  And yes, someone can do internet porn too much.

Nq4FWEIcaa	You are so wired to do the sexual act and you put pressure on yourself to do the deed that you can't do it.  My advice to you is to have foreplay sex for the first couple of times without intercourse.  Get your body used to being naked with your girlfriend and have her stimulate you orally and with her touch.  When you get used to doing this then take the next step and put your penis in her.  You may need more than a few times to do this before you may be ready for intercourse.  When you finally decide you want to have intercourse, go slowly and take your time.  Put your penis in slowly and use deep but slow thrusts.  Give your penis and your girlfriend time to get used to this sensation.  After a little while you can go thrust faster until you both have an orgasm.  I guess I'm saying to you is don't rush yourself.|`|3qenINMHaa	nerves,try having a drink or two of alcohol first,not too many or it'll have the opposite effect....just try to relax and enjoy the moment|`|2OO9U8o9aa	It is just nerves because it is a first for both of you , and the guy is especially nervous because he needs to get hard to make anything happen .

Then use lots of foreplay , kissing , caressing including of course intimate touching . Just relax , even if it goes a bit soft , don't get stressed about it , just carry on rubbing and touching each other . Make sure you are in a place that t=you will not be disturbed and you have lots of time together . Take lots of time and I am sure it will happen ok .

dUj7rP2haa	In my mind everyone who takes diet pills is making a mistake. Either the pills don't work at all, or you just put the weight back on when you stop taking them. Many of the manufactures make doubtful claims as to the effects of their products.  They are expensive.  And lets face it, if there was a magic pill there would be way less overweight people.<br>  <br>  If you're friend hasn't done so yet... he may want to go talk to his doctor about his weight and the shortness of breath.  Just in case it's a sign of an underlining undiagnosed condition.  Then if that all checks out, he should look at his portion sizes which is often a problem for people who eat healthy but are still overweight.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	Those diet pills don't work in the long run. I have a friend that's kinda like your friend's shape/size and he took pills constantly but he kept yo-yoing.  And as you mentioned there are side effects like increased heart rate etc... this can't be normal bec it actually gets your heart pumping more than it should constantly  and if you take alot, you have a chance of a heart attack...<br>  <br>  Just stick to a healthy diet and exercise. Sounds like he is doing a good job doing those. ..Just stick with it.

XssPCV5laa	Hey.<br>  Sounds like all your other issues with your brother, with relationships, with personal habits...are surrounding not having much self-confidence...which, as you said yourself, comes from your weight and how you feel about your weight.<br>  <br>  It's good to lose weight not just for your physical health but to help you feel better mentally too. If you're really serious, you could go to your doctor and have them help you work out a meal/exercise plan to follow.<br>  <br>  Whatever plan you choose, make sure you stick to it. Don't just eat less... but eat more healthily. I think once you've started working on your weight, all the other things will start to fall into place.<br>  <br>  Most girls like guys that feel confident about themselves, you just need to be friendly and happy to chat about whatever they're interested in. You're not a boring person. Sometimes we just get stuck in routines that we can't get out of, and there's not much excitement left in them... if any of your friends invites you out, or you have some opportunity given to you  - then take it! Always. Sometimes just making one small effort like that can lead to much bigger, more exciting things. Trust me.<br>  <br>  I'm 16 too... for a while, I was in a similar situation. Fed up with my life... I think most of us get there at some point or another. You really do seem to have a lot of awareness of what the problems are, which is great... because now you can start to work on them. Best of luck.<br>  .

JHlS5VDMaa	Applying heat is good- generally 20min at a time max. You may also want to try some stretching.  My 'back routine' is to lay on the floor (hard surface is best) on my back bring one knee to chest and hold while relaxing and taking deep breaths. Switch knees. Then do both at the same time.  Next with the help of a scarf/towel or person, with your leg straight, use the scarf/towel or have the person draw your leg off the floor pressing it toward your chest- keep your leg as straight as possible without locking the knee (the reason for the assist is to keep the muscles as loose as possible- you are trying to stretch them) Hold the stretch beathing deeply and pulling/pressing the leg gently w/ each exhale: if it hurts stop! Next, place your ankle on the opposite knee and using the assist slighty pull/rock the knee/leg across and hold.  Stop if you have knee pain and realign- this should not hurt the knee. You should feel the stretch in the outer and back of thigh.  With all of these you want to gently stretch and then release in order to maximize the stretch. keeping ankle on opposite knee let your leg fall open to stretch the inner thigh- just relax and breathe. Then move on to the other leg. These help relieve any tightness in the legs as the mucles in the thigh/hip- aggravate and even contribute to back pain.  A good 'stretch' for the lower back itself is a pelvic tilt.  Lying flat with feet flat on floor and knees bent take a deep breath and then push your lower back into the floor as you exhale (you are not arching with the hips only the lower back). This tilts the pelvis/hips opening the hip flexors. Imagine a string from your belly button through the floor and someone is gently pulling on it.  This is not a dramatic move, if it is you are producing the movement from the hips and pushing with the feet- it should begin from the lower back, the movement of which slightly tips/rocks the pelvis back...you should feel the stretch in the lower back and along the outside of the hips and ever so slightly the front of the hips. Hold the postition for several seconds breathing even and deeply: trying to deepen the stretch.  Next gently roll to your knees and from a kneeling position- toes pointed. Assume what is called the prayer position, body folded forward with the arms out above your head like a diver and resting on the floor.  Sink/rock your buttocks down toward your heels to gently round your back, you should feel a good stretch from the hamstrings and lower back to the mid back. If you feel it in your shoulders it means you are forcing the stretch from there- this stretch is a gravity controlled stretch.  Breathe, sinking back on your heels and inching forward with your hands as you exhale.  Your back should NOT be arched it should be slightly rounded or flat.  Gently get to your feet: remember you want to maintain the loose muscles and using gravity only (you want to stretch the muscle not use them) take nice even deep breaths, bend forward from the waist/hips letting your arms dangle to the floor, sinking further with each exhale- do not force your hands to the floor let gravity and the lengthening muscles carry them there. *note* If you need to- not sure how bad your back is- you may want to do this stretch next to a counter or a wall if you need assistance to raise yourself into an standing position.|`|sAEYkNSqaa	Try laying flat on your back with a hot water bottle underneath you|`|9pwNg7Ydaa	Try lying on something like a bed, stomech up back down, and lay on top of something hot, like heating pads, or those hot rubber things :] hope this helped u! please answer my question too....

CE4K7kQvaa	Attention Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) :-<br>  <br>  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition that becomes apparent in some children in the preschool and early school years. It is hard for these children to control their behavior and/or pay attention.<br>  <br>  ADHD - CAUSE<br>  <br>  Most substantiated causes appear to fall in the realm of neurobiology and genetics. This is not to say that environmental factors may not influence the severity of the disorder, but such factors do not seem to give rise to the condition by themselves.<br>  <br>  ADHD - SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS<br>  <br>  The principal characteristics of ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms appear early in a child's life. When the child's hyperactivity, distractibility, poor concentration, or impulsivity begin to affect performance in school, social relationships with other children, or behavior at home, ADHD may be suspected. But because the symptoms vary so much across settings, ADHD is not easy to diagnose. This is especially true when inattentiveness is the primary symptom. <br>  <br>  There are three subtypes of ADHD recognized by professionals. These are the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type (that does not show significant inattention); the predominantly inattentive type (that does not show significant hyperactive-impulsive behavior) sometimes called ADD—an outdated term for this entire disorder; and the combined type (that displays both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms).<br>  <br>  HOW DIAGNOSIS IS DONE for ADHD?<br>  <br>  Because everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, the diagnosis requires that such behavior be demonstrated to a degree that is inappropriate for the person's age. The diagnostic guidelines also contain specific requirements for determining when the symptoms indicate ADHD. The behaviors must appear early in life, before age 7, and continue for at least 6 months. Above all, the behaviors must create a real handicap in at least two areas of a person's life such as in the schoolroom, on the playground, at home, in the community, or in social settings. So someone who shows some symptoms but whose schoolwork or friendships are not impaired by these behaviors would not be diagnosed with ADHD. Nor would a child who seems overly active on the playground but functions well elsewhere receive an ADHD diagnosis.<br>  <br>  To assess whether a child has ADHD, specialists consider several critical questions: Are these behaviors excessive, long-term, and pervasive? That is, do they occur more often than in other children the same age? Are they a continuous problem, not just a response to a temporary situation? Do the behaviors occur in several settings or only in one specific place like the playground or in the schoolroom? The person's pattern of behavior is compared against a set of criteria and characteristics of the disorder as listed in the DSM-IV-TR.<br>  <br>  HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT for Attention Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<br>  <br>  Homeopathic medicines are known to have deep effect on human psychology and have been found effective in various mental and psychological disorders. The focus of homeopathy is not to treat the isolated symptoms of ADHD but to treat the child as a whole. Not only the symptoms of ADHD but also the general physical and mental constitution of the patient, past medical history, medical history of parents, information about pregnancy and vaccination - all are used to find the probable cause in a given case and based on the final analysis a remedy is chosen for a patient. The following medicines may help in the treatment of ADHD -<br>  <br>  ADHD - CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT<br>  <br>  The conventional treatment primarily uses a class of drugs known as stimulants (amphetamines). <br>  <br>  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?<br>  <br>  You can join various support groups. Behavioural therapy, Social-skills training, Parenting skills training, Psychotherapy can be useful for the patient and the family.<br>  <br>  REFERENCE WORKS<br>  <br>  Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 14th ed, McGraw-Hill<br>  <br>  Davidson's Principles and Practise of Medicine, 17th ed, 1996, Churchill Livingstone<br>  <br>  New Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica & Repertory, William Boericke, 2nd revised ed., 2001, B.

Or if you financially qualify, check out medicaid.|`|W6wamWLLaa	Yeha, go to you're doctor.|`|CQshcvwQaa	Yes, i get it from my doctor all the time.|`|UaTUskC7aa	A psychologist would have to have a few interview sessions with you and give you a number of tests (no needles and no pass or fail :) That will help them understand how you learn / react to situations.  Maybe it's not adhd?<br>  <br>  If it turns out that you do have it, then you'd likely need their formal assessment before the doctor prescribed you with any medication.  (At least this would be the case of an ethical doctor.) The other thing to think about, too, is that medication is only one of several options.  It might or might not help you, and there are other things you can do to help focus and concentrate.  A psychologist would definitely be able to help you out with those things.
kCNInRgUaa	I had a root on the canal once.<br>  God it was good.|`|YHxCmEX0aa	After getting a root canal, you need to get a permanent filling and crown placed on the tooth to complete the process.

And some adults simply aren't up to it.|`|TsjqzanQaa	We don't yet understand fully what causes this, but it is horrible for an adult man to abuse a little girl, and I can't understand why people do these things.<br>  <br>  I do think that there's something terribly sick and wrong with adults who dress up little girls and put all sorts of makeup on them, and enter them in pageants, like that poor Jon Benet Ramsey girl who was murdered.<br>  <br>  Sexualizing little girls is wrong, and while it's okay for little girls to play at dress-up, I think that there's something very wrong with institutionalizing this in pageants.<br>  <br>  It only encourages the sickos out there who look at little girls in a sexual way.<br>  <br>  But this in no way excuses the individuals out there who prey on children.<br>  <br>  With so many repeat offenders, it seems clear to me that the punishments need to be increased, so that children can be protected from the predators.<br>  <br>  And it isn't just men, look at the female teachers these days having sex with students!<br>  <br>  Having worked in a psychiatric hospital, I'm astonished at the number of fathers who sexually abuse their own daughters.      <br>  <br>  There is no clear cause, no cure for this, but we can only try to be careful about protecting our children from molestation, and be aware that it isn't always strangers, it can be a family member.<br>  <br>  And boys need to be protected, also.|`|46q8TMQTaa	I disagree with all the other answers and will make no friends with this one I can assure you.  These male/females, of all ages, are mentally "stuck" with a little boy/girl and that is the only thing that will "turn them on".  It is actually a mental disorder.  The age can be from infant to teen.  THERE IS NO CURE!!! 99.9% of the people have been abused themselves at about the same age as those they choose to abuse. Therapy is seldom helpful to either the abuser or the abused.  The perfect example is all of the priests who abuse preteen boys.  They were all abused themselves.  The only thing that can be done is abstinence......difficult.  The length of abuse is a factor and the age of the victim will sometimes allow them to live a somewhat "normal" life as is evidenced by the abused young men who came forward about the priest abuse after many many years of carrying the secret. God bless them|`|MFMaX2b1aa	I was sexually assulted at the age of 4. <br>  They are such small minded, self centered, arrogent self obsorbed morons who don't understand how much pain, and misery that they are putting that girl through.<br>  <br>  I can't have my innocence back, I can't wait until I'm married to share my virginity with my partner, and I can't take back those memories.<br>  <br>  It's hard actually knowing that it's happened to me, and whoever does sexually abuse others, can ROT IN HELL. <br>  <br>  God bless - I hope this helped.|`|zgQZJUHwaa	Those men are bad men.

I listen to the crickets every night, I'm out in fifteen minutes or so. <br>  <br>  The hardest thing will be to eliminate CAFFEINE from your life. Some people are exceptionally sensitive to caffeine, and although most of us are very blase about caffeine and ingest it all day long (coffee, sodas, tea, chocolate) the fact is that caffeine is a VERY POWERFUL DRUG.  If you are unable to completely eliminate it from your diet, then at least cut yourself off at five o'clock. Make it a LAW that you are unable to imbibe one drop of caffeine after five o'clock. Try lemonade, or even better, just plain water.<br>  <br>  Also, you didn't mention this, but some people also get up two or three times a night to urinate. This also interferes with good, quality, uninterrupted sleep. If this is an issue for you, then you'll have to cut yourself off from ALL liquids after 5 or 6 o'clock. This is very hard to do, but the benefits are practically immediate.|`|maeGnrRjaa	the best thing you can do is get in a routine.

Check out www.3treasure.com for further information.|`|mVJdfjrmaa	Try putting a drop or two of pure lavender oil (get a good quality essential oil) on both sides of your pillow when going to sleep. Avoid all caffeine and stimulants after about 4 in the afternoon. There is hidden caffeine in ordinary Ceylon tea, loads of caffeine in chocolate, especially dark chocolate, and also many kinds of headache tablets - read the labels. Drink a cup of camomile tea in bed before you go to sleep. You can also try herbal sedatives - plenty on the market - but don't combine too many of these remedies at once or you may sleep too deeply. I'd suggest the lavender oil and camomile tea combination first, together with avoidance of caffeine. Good luck.|`|AA11173395	Eliminate all caffeine and alcohol.  Get at least thirty minutes vigorous exercise every day.  In the evenings, drink cups of chamomile tea with several drops of valerian tincture.

Health class teachers aren't exaggerating the risks of smoking like they exaggerate the risks of sex and make too much of a big deal about drinking and drugs. Smoking does cause lung cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, stomach cancer, throat and lips cancer, cancer of the oesophagus, emphysema, and heart disease. Your at a much higher risk to have a stroke at a younger age, you get a lesser sense of smell, thyroid disease is easier to get, a reduced sense of taste, vascular disease, bad circulation, stomach ulcers, osteoporosis and a weakened immune system. Plus, there are so many chemicals and gross things in cigarettes that cause fifty million other diseases. <br>  <br>  Take it from someone who's boyfriend died seven months ago when he was seventeen from a smoking-caused heart attack during a soccer game and someone who had leukaemia as a child (non-smoking caused but still)--don't smoke. You'll ruin your own life, and other lives too.|`|6HIuqEUyaa	Yesh,<br>  <br>  <br>  How do cigarettes damage health?<br>  <br>  Cigarettes contain more than 4000 chemical compounds and at least 400 toxic substances. <br>  <br>  When you inhale, a cigarette burns at 700°C at the tip and around 60°C in the core. This heat breaks down the tobacco to produce various toxins. <br>  <br>  As a cigarette burns, the residues are concentrated towards the butt. <br>  <br>  The products that are most damaging are:<br>  <br>  <br>  tar, a carcinogen (substance that causes cancer)<br>  <br>  <br>  nicotine is addictive and increases cholesterol levels in your body<br>  <br>  <br>  carbon monoxide reduces oxygen in the body<br>  <br>  <br>  components of the gas and particulate phases cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).<br>  <br>  Trust me it's bad to smoke at any age, but especially 14|`|4BeKVZsPaa	it will kill you slowly<br>  you will ignore it for the years of your youth as your natural strengths will help you to act as though you don't smoke but as the years go by, your lungs will clog up, your breathing will become difficult and you will start to wheeze. just walking up a flight of stairs will be a breathless effort and you will not have the stamina to do anything worthwhile. <br>  your veins will become clogged with fatty deposits and heart attacks will be a frightening reality.<br>  you will spend ridiculous amounts of money each week which could be spent on a fancy holiday each year instead and you will die coughing and grunting with yellow and withered skin.<br>  every time you try to pack it in you get high blood pressure and become moody and bad tempered and you clothes and body will smell. your teeth will go first yellow and later turn brown with nicotine and you will never be able to clean them properly without the stale taste of a cigarette hanging about on your taste buds.<br>  you will tell everyone that it doesnt affect you and that it makes you happy and your children will cry when you die younger than you should have and all because of cigarettes.<br>  dont be a pr4t, stub it out now.|`|NP98ui6xaa	noway.. smoke it up.. your going to die anyways..|`|l9ab36z4aa	it bad to smoke at any age.<br>  If you smaoke form a young age you weaken you lungs slowly.

He died of lung cancer when he was about 42. The Doctors said that even though he stopped smoking, it still caught up with him. He was lucky he stopped that early!<br>  <br>  Another thing, the marlboro man who poses on the horse on the Marlboro brand of cigarettes? Yeah, he's the third model. Want to know what happened to the other two? They died of lung cancer.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  "Starting at the Top<br>  <br>  As a smoker, you're at risk for cancer of the mouth. Tobacco smoke can also cause gum disease, tooth decay and bad breath. The teeth become unsightly and yellow. Smokers may experience frequent headaches. And lack of oxygen and narrowed blood vessels to the brain can lead to strokes.<br>  <br>  Lungs and Bronchi<br>  <br>  Moving down to your chest, smoke passes through the bronchi, or breathing tubes. Hydrogen cyanide and other chemicals in the smoke attack the lining of the bronchi, inflaming them and causing that chronic smoker's cough. Because the bronchi are weakened, you're more likely to get bronchial infections. Mucus secretion in your lungs is impaired, also leading to chronic coughing. Smokers are 10 times as likely to get lung cancer and emphysema as nonsmokers.<br>  <br>  Smoking and the Heart<br>  <br>  The effects of smoking on your heart are devastating. Nicotine raises blood pressure and makes the blood clot more easily. Carbon monoxide robs the blood of oxygen and leads to the development of cholesterol deposits on the artery walls. All of these effects add up to an increased risk of heart attack. In addition, the poor circulation resulting from cholesterol deposits can cause strokes, loss of circulation in fingers and toes and impotence.<br>  <br>  Smoking and the Body's Organs<br>  <br>  The digestive system is also affected. The tars in smoke can trigger cancer of the esophagus and throat. Smoking causes increased stomach acid secretion, leading to heartburn and ulcers. Smokers have higher rates of deadly pancreatic cancer. Many of the carcinogens from cigarettes are excreted in the urine where their presence can cause bladder cancer, which is often fatal. High blood pressure from smoking can damage the kidneys.<br>  <br>  The Results<br>  <br>  The health effects of smoking have results we can measure. Forty percent of men who are heavy smokers will die before they reach retirement age, as compared to only 18 percent of nonsmokers. Women who smoke face an increased risk of cervical cancer, and pregnant women who smoke take a chance with the health of their unborn babies.<br>  <br>  But the good news is that when you quit smoking your body begins to repair itself. Ten years after you quit, your body has repaired most of the damage smoking caused. Those who wait until cancer or emphysema has set in aren't so lucky—these conditions are usually fatal. It's one more reason to take the big step and quit now."|`|hTbvfUOeaa	any age its bad|`|ABWQgoDtaa	all ages. And yes it is.|`|FTwqWIOxaa	of course...it will be bad at all ages as said by the answer above...<br>  your lungs is still fresh and yet you will get it weak and malfunction. you can have leukemia for smoking. smoking will increase your heart rate and blood pressure, straining your heart and blood vessels, This can cause heart attacks and stroke. It slows your blood flow, cutting off oxygen to your feet and hands. Some smokers end up having their limbs<br>  amputated, Tar coats your lungs like soot in a chimney and causes cancer. A 20-a-day smoker breathes in up to a full cup (210 g) of tar in a year, Carbon monoxide robs your muscles, brain and body tissue of oxygen, making your whole body and especially your heart  work harder. Over time, your airways swell up and let less air into your lungs, Smoking causes disease and is a slow way to die. The strain put on your body by smoking often causes years of suffering. Emphysema  is an illness that slowly rots your lungs. People with emphysema often get bronchitis  again and again, and suffer lung and heart failure, Lung cancer from smoking  is caused by the tar in tobacco smoke. Men who smoke are ten times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers, Heart disease and strokes are also more common among smokers than non-smokers, Smoking causes fat deposits to narrow and block blood vessels which leads to heart attack, In younger people, three out of four deaths from heart disease are due to smoking.<br>  <br>  remember one cigarette, one minute loss in your life.<br>  <br>  you can do any things you wanna do except smoking and drugs. it can kill you for your young age. so don't use or stop using cigarettes and drugs.|`|q5g8zIhwaa	yes<br>  <br>  but its bad to smoke at any age i suppose|`|M3BFlxlraa	yes|`|SaAQZiG4aa	yes shame on u|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Really bad  your heart and body is still developing and its damaging you alot you've got a better chance of getting cancer or a serious disease at a younger age but you shouldn't smoke at all.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Who is asking this question? is it a joke or something....<br>  Of course its not bad to smoke at 14, you will just die at age 20, but thats not a big deal if your stupid enough to do it|`|tkPamsvSaa	it's gross, unhealthy, smelly, and stupid. alot of people who smoke never die of old age, they die or lung cancer.

Vitamin B7 Biotin<br>  - This type of B-complex vitamin does well to encourage hair growth, strengthen hair and prevent hair loss.<br>  <br>  2. Egg treatment<br>  - You may not like the idea of dumping egg on your head but the fact remains that it can remedy your hair loss. It's able to strengthen your hair.<br>  <br>  3. Change your shampoo<br>  -Take a look at your shampoo and see if it contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) or Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate (ALS)? These are corrosive ingredients and are used in household and commercial cleaners such as car wash soap, engine degreaser, and garage floor cleaners. It is said to attack your hair follicles and interfere with hair growth. <br>  <br>  4.

I tried propecia withot being aware of the side effects. I found out later that it causes erectile dysfunction and impotence and even worse the side effects can continue after you stop taking it.<br>  <br>     I would change your diet for a start. High fat diets are known to contribute towards hair loss. If you put junk food in your mouth your going to pass junk to your hair, since your hair is 95% protein it really is what you eat. If you eat a healthy diet full of vegetables and fruit your body and hair will get all the protein you need.<br>  <br>  Take hair supplements.These not only contain vitamins for your hair including biotin, proteins and minerals. They also include DHT blockers or inhibitors. DHT blockers stop your body making DHT, which is the main cause of hair loss and baldness.<br>  <br>  Use a good shampoo on your head. If you use a poor shampoo it will damage your hair and in some cases the worst shampoo's can cause scalp damage too.<br>  <br>  If you smoke stop. In a recent medical study a group of smokers were fround to suffer higher than normal hair loss than their non smoking counterparts. The research suggested this was because smoking was reducing the blood supply to the follicles.|`|SE9FSpZoaa	I have a guy friend who's hair has been thinning out and he uses Provillus to combat it.

be09a22e45d965eb9be079d5c83a498caa	Despite what many might tell you, there are two "secrets" to getting active and more energetic - diet and exercise. Personally, I've cut way back on the junk food I eat and have been snacking more on fruits and vegetables - especially what I call "finger" or "hand" foods (which most fruits are). These are things like apples and grapes and stuff that require NO preparation (not even peeling). Instead of grabbing a handful of cookies or chips, I grab a handful of grapes, raisins, or an apple. I also cut way way back on the soda. Where I used to drink 3-4 sodas a day, I now drink that many in a week. Instead, I drink iced tea or fruit juice.<br>  <br>  The second "secret" is exercise. Anything that gets you up and moving is exercise. My biggest issue was just getting motivated to exercise. What has really worked for me is find something I like to do (in my case, bicycle riding) and work towards the goal of being able to go out for nice long rides this coming summer. In about 7 weeks, my morning exercise routine has gone from a sad 5 minutes to over 30 minutes, and I combine both strength and cardio exercises each day.<br>  <br>  I also do just a little research on the subject every day. Maybe 10-15 minutes. Just enough to add a little bit more to my knowledge and to help me make more informed decisions, but not so much that I have trouble absorbing the knowledge. Over time, it begins to add up.<br>  <br>  And here's the nice thing, in about 7 weeks, my body now looks forward to the morning exercise. I feel so much better afterward.I'm still not quite where I want to be, but I am much closer.<br>  <br>  In the end, just getting up and moving is what is required. As you become more fit, you might want to increase the intensity to keep it challenging. It is about what works for you.|`|1gTy1XqXaa	I do half an hour of muscle workouts on it a day,<br>  & then whatever else i feel like.<br>  People say its not good, but I've really toned up, and lost a little weight.<br>  So if you enjoy it, carry on.<br>  =]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have my email address on my Y!A page if you want to email me.<br>  <br>  =]|`|oJuD20CSaa	Wii Fit only worked for me when I combined it with a dumbell and a weight vest, and a step stool<br>  <br>  25 pounds in 2 months<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Slimming-Down-With-Stevie-Maximum-Wii-Fit" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Slimming-Down-Wi...</a>|`|C0zSp3Nkaa	Some Of the exorcises are relaxing while others make your sweat.

7e02335d8db7a10c3a3a227b20d16521aa	I am guessing that this will be your first menstrual period.  Sometimes when you are first starting your period (I mean for the first time ever) you will feel sort of "crampy" in your lower abdomen and sometimes your low back.  This can happen for a couple months around the time you would have your period.  Then one of those months you will actually start having your period.  The first period may be sort of gooey red at first then the "goo" will lessen and be more just blood which darkens during the 5 or so days of your period.  Since you had some blood then nothing, I suspect that you are going to start having your period on a regular basis soon.  A normal period starts and goes for several days. (you will figure out what is normal for you after a couple times)  Normal menstruation occurs one time each 28 days or about one time a month, and lasts 5 -7 days.  I think you should talk to your Mom about what occurred and together you can talk about what it is like to have your period each month.  In regard to your question about how many times a day....once it actually starts it will continue for 5-7 days, it will not "come out" at particular times.  I hope this helps and really encourage you to talk to your Mom.  Good luck.|`|AA11117029	That's exactly what happened to me but don't worry, it will come. It will start to come again soon, and the next day. The color can range from a brown to a red. I found that when I first got it it was irregular and weird when blood came out, but it will eventually come out. Tell your mom by the way. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|dV6PEdmGaa	IF GOOEY RED BLOOD CAME OUT THEN U ARE ON UR PERIOD <br>  EVERYONES PERIOD DAYS ARE DIFFERENT <br>  EG MINE LASTS FOR 2 DAYS BUT ALL DAY <br>  SO WE ARE ALL DIFF ! <br>  <br>  WAIT TILL IT COMES AGAIN THEN TELL UR MOTHER <br>  BUT IF NOTHING IS COMING OUT NOW THEN U DONT HAVE IT|`|hCfm9mxXaa	that is what happened to me. I thought i got it a school, and i did. Just a spot though. and it didnt come back. so i didnt tell my mom and eventually it came back. its just your body basically starting the process. It will take some time. I  have had mine for 3 years and it is still random and irregular just like my moms was until she had me.<br>  Nothing to worry about. If you are comfortable with it talk to your mom. if anything it may be akward but it gets a sense of worry of your chest.<br>  And yes it can be coming out all day. Depending on alot of things it can change and vary from colors of brown, red just like normal blood, thin, thick, and yes even gooey. Hopes this helps.|`|h1e6TvFpaa	it could still start up again,<br>  you should tell your mom<br>  it can be gooy red, thats fine<br>  it can come whenever it wants to come<br>  it can come out all day|`|7ZsD0Irtaa	just tell ur mom it came it doesnt come constantly and sometimes thru ur life it may not even come

eFW5O92Yaa	For the eating plan, I only know so much. Obviously you need to eat more than you burn to gain muscle (makes sense right?), and just eat healthy and your suppose to have 1/1.5g of protein per pound you weigh. I have heard rice is a good diet food because it fills you up, but doesn't make you gain much weight to do so.<br>  <br>  For the excercise plan the cardio seems fine. The weight lifting looks a little bit wide varietied. A professional routine works 6 days a week and each muscle group twice a week(every 3 days). Your reps are 20, which are suppose to be 8-12 and be pushing yourself at 12, with 3-4sets per excersize, and 3-4 different excercizes per muscle group. Heres my routine:<br>  <br>  Day 1:<br>  Biceps, triceps, forearms, shoulders<br>  Day 2:<br>  Traps, Chest, Lats/back, obliques, abs<br>  Day 3:<br>  Quads, calf, hamstring, side of leg(not sure what it's called)<br>  <br>  Then repeat it for another 3 days and then take a days' break. Hope this helped you.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|7tNv9T3oaa	eat less food|`|dDTjpU3Baa	EAT  3  SMALL MEALS A DAY DO NOT DEPRIVE YOUR BODY OF ANY ESSENTAIL FOOD.

iSNtznE3aa	I have eczema, so I can tell you what it feels like. I also have allergies, so I can tell you the difference.<br>  <br>  First of all, eczema doesn't just appear. You're born with it. You can have it all over, in small patches, or sometimes even just one area. I have one tiny patch on my thigh (about the size of a quarter) and that's the only place I have it, but it drives me up the wall!<br>  <br>  It will always feel dry and rather...different to the touch (very hard to explain), no matter how much lotion you put on it. Some days you won't notice you have it, and other days you have such an impulse to scratch it you can't stop yourself. The skin shouldn't be sore, or look any different (except to doctors, who are trained to see differences).<br>  <br>  Allergies, on the other hand, are either hives or a common rash (I've had both several times). Hives are swelling and constantly itching lumps that can disappear and appear in different places overnight. They are often very sore, because they swell your skin and blood vessels up badly.<br>  <br>  The common rash is a patch of redness that can be anywhere, and is often caused by an allergy to something that touched your skin. They can itch or not itch, they can swell and not swell, but they are never sore and almost always red.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that will help you decide. But if you're still unsure, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist and ask.|`|JDsgCDGUaa	Eczema is normally spots/lumps only Little ones. and a big area of them<br>  Just ask your doctor or dermatologist|`|NFvZDiNSaa	if you have been stressed or something like that then that is most likely to be eczema! if you have tried eating something new lately then you have probaly got an allergic to it so stop eating it! :D xxx|`|08eX98xuaa	Your doctor can probably run a test for an allergy.

There also should be leaflets in each packet to tell you about the drug, the dose etc.<br>  <br>  Dioderm cream is used for eczema, inflammation of the skin (dermatitis), reactions to insect bites and stings<br>  Ranitidine is used to treat certain conditions caused by too much acid being produced in the stomach, such as stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers), ulcers of the upper part of the intestine (duodenal ulcers), reflux oesophagitis (acid reflux or heartburn) and Zollinger-Ellison disease,<br>  Cetirizine belongs to the group of medicines known as antihistamines.

Whether you respond or react to them is entirely your choice. <br>  <br>  When a bad thought emerges, immediately discard it and replace it with a more positive realistic thought.

66a13bf9fc4f5831c5a727b2e71e3db9aa	Herbs "work" if used properly and for the right reason. They can be potent medicine. If you don't believe it, take a capsule of Cascara Sagrada and see if it doesn't make you run to the bathroom in a few hours. Or put some Aloe Vera gel on a burn and see if it doesn't stop hurting. Or chew a piece of candied Ginger root next time you feel nausea and watch it go away before you've swallowed it all.<br>  <br>  But not all herbs work quickly like that. And not all work the same on everyone. And yes, there are a lot of unethical companies out there promoting miracles.<br>  <br>  Some herbs are verified with testing in other countries but not in the U.S. Germany has Ginkgo listed in their pharmacopoeia for asthma. Several European countries have approved Elderberry for fighting flu (Sambucol). Stevia is used as a substitute for sugar all over the world but it's not FDA approved. <br>  <br>  FDA approval requires tons of testing in expensive situations and the only way to make the money back is to charge the public. Sad, but most herbs will never generate that much money. Who is going to pay $100 for something they can grow in their back yard, like Mullein, Nettles, Ginkgo, Rosemary or Aloe?|`|an1b4pXxaa	Anything can work as a placebo, even homeopathic concoctions.<br>  <br>  I don't think herbs would work as reliably as mainstream medicine anyway even if they did have some good effects because the properties the herb has depends on it's health, age, when it the season it was picked etc Whereas mainstream medicine guarantees you are getting so many mg of the active ingredient.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	The fact that the FDA has never approved even one herb, out of the literally millions of diverse plants on this planet, ought to raise some questions right there. Follow the money - in the United States, drug companies give thousands of dollars in "campaign contributions" to every member of congress.<br>  <br>  And government actually does approve of and endorse herbs as medicine - just not every government. In Germany, the Commission E evaluates herbs using the best scientific standards and publishes scientific guidelines on dosage, usage, etc. for doctors to follow.  If herbs are a scam, someone better explain that to the German government.|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	Some of it probably is, but keep in mind that these herbs are the basis for many culture's medicines. Some people in modern society may view these people as backward or uncivilized, but I think we have a lot to learn from them. Not being FDA approved means that they haven't really been studied by the FDA, meaning that there's no "real" way to know whether these things work or not except by trying them.

I have fit several of those and 50 to 60% like them. Those who don't, go back to the Frequency 55.<br>  <br>  Don't get your hopes up about the Acuvue Advance for astigmatism, it has a very low success rate , and there are rumors that it will be removed from the market soon.That's why they came out with Oasys.<br>  <br>  The B&L Purevision also has a pretty good success rate.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your trials, there will almost surely be one that works...eventually....although Torics are rarely perfect.

If not, then you might not be protected.<br>  <br>  In general I don't recommend taking the map while on bc pills but you might need to - just ask your doctor and/or pharmacist first.

You'd have to eat barely anything to lose 4kg and you'd likely be fainting before you got there.<br>  <br>  Either give yourself more time, or a more realistic goal if you don't want to starve.  At a reasonable level, you can probably lose 1kg/week unless you're ridiculously overweight (which you're not).<br>  <br>  When you're close to an ideal weight, losing it it much harder.|`|c5ScseTdaa	You can't realistically burn 4kg in two weeks.  If you have enough water weight, you can shed some of that.  Terribly unhealthy, but I used to do it to fit into dresses for performances.  Smallest cast member gets the smallest dress whether it fits or not, you know!  I fasted and drank diuretics (tea, coffee) all day, then started rehydrating immediately after the scene with the smallest dress.  (And it still took three cast members to zip me in.  It was four sizes too small!)  Obviously there's no lasting benefit here, and you really have to keep on the tea and other flow-through liquids so you don't faint or do anything else dramatic from dehydration.<br>  <br>  Why do people have these interesting deadlines for weight loss?  Wedding or something with a 10k dress that simply must fit?|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|ipL7L5WSaa	carbs dont matter, only calorie count. dont go below 800 calories bcause you body will go into starvation mode and your metabolim will slow, and it could take months to lose that weight. try weight watchers or jenny craig for quickest results.|`|bMiMBc1haa	Well, you already took my answer about how unhealthy this is.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.
d94677ecce02ae2db351b104cd6f9c6caa	Insomnia can be tricky to pin down.  There are so many different types.  Here's some:<br>  <br>  - Caffeine and/or sugar sensitive but doesn't know it. Cure: cut out ALL forms of caffeine ALL day, and no sugar several hours before bed. <br>  <br>  - Anxious, gets tense and worried that can't fall asleep, which farther delays sleep, which creates more anxiety, which farther delays sleep, etc!  Cure:  Recognize this negative self talk.  Replace with positive such as "Ahh, no responsibilities for hours and hours.  I can just lay around and relax.  Boy is this bed cozy."<br>  <br>  - Has trouble calming down after day's (or book's) excitement.  Cure:  There are many mental relaxation exercises that are popular.  One:  Think of pleasant relaxing place to be.  Feel the breeze through your hair.  Another one:  Starting at your toes, think about each one and relax it.  Next ankles, etc, on up.  One more:  Pray for everyone you know, one at a time, every need you can think of.  Keep your eyes closed long enough laying motionless in the dark, and sleep happens.<br>  <br>  - Hyper-sensitive, wakes to every sound or beam of light. Cure:  room-darkening window shades, no night lights, and one of those background noise generators (or a small fan).<br>  <br>  - Overactive, keeps opening eyes to see what time it is, or getting out of bed and walking to bathroom/kitchen numerous times.<br>  <br>  - Physical discomfort.  Room too hot.  Bed too hard.  Covers too heavy or too thin.  Aches and pains.<br>  <br>  - Digestive upset or excitement (ex: taking vitamins with dinner, or chocolate dessert, red food color, etc.)<br>  <br>  One more thought.  If you do intend to resort to reading, do you have a really BORING book?  That will help, although the light being on will tell your body that it's not really night after all.  Maybe an itty bitty book light, or 2-watt night light.|`|bMiMBc1haa	Try melatonin.  It is safe, I started giving it to my 10 y/o at the doctors suggestion.  Follow the package directions.

It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Consider using egg substitutes (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|W6wamWLLaa	Suggesting website people are spammer and are computers, not people!!<br>  <br>  Cut calories to 1200 and work out ALOT!!<br>  Get a workout of the internet that you can do at home, walk everywhere, take up running and go wimmin and swim lanes slowly if you have acess to a pool.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|77PD0zvMaa	This might sound a bit weird but if you drink loads of water it makes you go to the toilet more making you fell less bloated as you will have less water in your body <br>  It does work as it also makes you a couple of pounds lighter xx|`|MORVkjY6aa	I don't believe in like eating medicine.....you should increase your workout/the gym thing....but make sure you run like a kilometer without stopping......if you cant run a kilometer, run like 500 meter ?|`|IjxyGwubaa	Hi there I guess you've been told before. This isn't rocket <br>  science. There's no magic about losing weight. <br>  <br>  You need to eat less and exercise a little more. This clearly <br>  over-simplifies your weight problem but you just need to <br>  burn off more calories than you consume.<br>  <br>  As you are probably aware, excess body weight is one of the <br>  major risk factors for developing heart disease. So is a diet <br>  high in saturated fat from processed foods.<br>  <br>  A balanced diet is essential to provide your body with the <br>  nutrients to allow it to function correctly. Sometimes we make <br>  the wrong decisions and find making healthy choices a <br>  challenge. <br>  <br>  You are what you eat. It is important to eat at least 3 main <br>  meals a day with fruit snacks in between. Your healthy way <br>  of eating becomes your long term healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  A few key points to slimming without suffering.<br>  a) a diet with 1200-1700 cals a day, low in fat, high in fibre, <br>  and balanced for carbohydrate, protein and fat<br>  b) eat fruit and vegetables every day, at least 5 servings.<br>  c) drink 6-8 glasses of water a day.<br>  d) make regular exercise part of your lifestyle to condition <br>  your heart and relieve stress.<br>  e) supplement your diet with vitamins and minerals. Most <br>  important are the B vitamins, vitamin C and the minerals <br>  zinc and chromium.<br>  f) finally you need discipline and perseverance, unless you do <br>  it regularly you won't get the results.<br>  <br>  And now some don'ts<br>  Don't skip meals. <br>  Don't eat too few calories <br>  Don't beat yourself up if you over-indulge<br>  Don't become a diet bore!<br>  <br>  Well here goes then.

CN0cLscZaa	I'm in the same boat. I've had tinnitus for more than 2 months now, and mine is most likely permanent, and I'm only 20. Mine was caused by hearing loss due to over exposer to loud noise. I can't tell you the likelihood of it being permanent since I don't really know anything about your hearing loss. But I would recommend that you see an otolaryngologist that specialized in tinnitus, and an audiologist for a hearing test. They will be able to help you.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, try not to think about it. At night, if it is too bothersome, play some white noise (<a href="http://www.simplynoise.com/)," rel="nofollow">http://www.simplynoise.com/),</a> or turn on a fan. Thinking about it will only make it worse, ignoring can actually physically make it better. Also, you might want to start taking some vitamins and minerals such as vitamin e, zinc and magnesium. You'll have a better prognosis if you start treating it asap.<br>  <br>  You should visit my blog, <a href="http://mylifewithtinnitus.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mylifewithtinnitus.blogspot.com/</a> , I think that it might be a little helpful.

c5ScseTdaa	I think you're getting models and fitness buffs confused!  ^_^<br>  <br>  The girls in the magazines look good for a living, and have a lot of help doing it:  they have the genes, the makeup artist, the personal trainers (for way, WAY more than 80 minutes a day . . . think hours!), and a crazy amount of ambition.  I'm not sure what percent of them are actually healthy, but we know ambition overcomes health concerns for many of them.<br>  <br>  Now as far as actual athletes go, they still work out quite a bit, but they eat massive amounts of food!  I had athletic friends in college, and it was amazing to watch a little tiny fencer girl put away about three trays of food on a regular basis.  When you work out for many, many hours a day, your body needs that fuel!<br>  <br>  To be truly healthy and energetic and fit, you need that fuel.  You're actually shortchanging your workouts by eating too little if you feel hungry.  I actually gain weight if I don't eat enough (go figure), and my workouts are either lame or don't happen because I feel so blah.<br>  <br>  Ditch the magazines and go catch a women's athletic event:  soccer, basketball, whatever you'd enjoy watching.

pa8vbP5taa	I suggest you read this article on penis size...<br>  <a href="http://blog.fucktube.com/penis-size/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.fucktube.com/penis-size/</a>|`|osY0xlhTaa	Penis enlargement is one of those areas that is rife with scam artists, preying on people’s insecurities. There ARE methods that work, but you need to choose carefully.<br>  <br>  There are 2 chambers (the Corpora Cavernosa) inside the penis which fill with blood when you get an erection. Penis size is limited by the amount of blood that these chambers can hold. The only scientific way to get a bigger penis is to increase the amount of blood these chambers can hold – more blood in means a bigger erect penis.<br>  <br>  Enlargement pills are probably the biggest scam. There is no proof, scientific or otherwise, that any of them work. The better ones increase blood flow, so should give you a stronger erection, but none of them will give you any extra size - because they do not increase the amount of blood the penis can hold.<br>  <br>  The only method which can do this is enlargement exercises. These work by driving blood into the chambers (using your hands) and so gradually expanding them. By consistently doing the exercises for a few minutes every day, it is possible to get a longer and thicker penis.<br>  <br>  You do need to know how to do the exercises properly – there’s a good site at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a>|`|W6wamWLLaa	Yeah, Go to you're doctor or look online for some sort of thing to enlarge it.|`|ZkwtldYlaa	You should be happy with what you have.<br>  <br>  However if you really feel the need to increase your penis size,then you should try out these :<br>  <br>  Here are four good natural penis enhancement techniques I recommend for rookies. Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds.

y4SUDnpaaa	I believe your father is absolutely correct. Sounds like he's trying to help you learn some self discipline and stop relying so much on your mother.  As long as you allow your mother to bail you out of financial problems and to run life  you'll never cut the apron strings and become the independent adult you should be at your age.I would also advise you to see a psycharist while you're using your sick time. Clearly you need some help and probably some meds that can only be prescribed by a psychatrist. You also need sone theraphy to get help from an entirely abjective  person, not your parents who are too close to you to make objective suggestions, especially your mother. I am in no way inferring your mother has set out to ruin your life, as a mother she's doing what she thinks is right for you...............the problem is what she's doing is having the opposite effect on your life. There is nothing wrong in wanting to be a writer but you should know there are millions of people who want the same thing, have been trying for years and have yet to have a book published, much less a best seller. Moving in with your mom and having her suppport you while you pursue your dreams will turn into a permanent situation. Your own answers to these problems are good, excellent and you just have to follow them.........that's all. I intentionally made that last remark  as a sarcastic one. If you could change this situation by yourself you would have done it and because it's one of the common phrases   ingnorant   people, who have no conception or emotional or mental problems, use.

But very few people have a suitable donor for transplant.<br>  <br>  As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. If you have sickle cell anemia, you'll need to make regular visits to your doctor to check your red blood cell count and monitor your health. You may also require treatment from specialists at a hospital or sickle cell anemia clinic. Treatments may include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, blood transfusions and supplemental oxygen, as well as bone marrow transplant.

y4SUDnpaaa	The counselor does  have an obligation to tell your parents if you are engaging in dangerous practices. You can tell your parents  yourself without placing blame on them. The three of you should sit down and you should tell them your problem. If they ask the reason, please don't tell them you think they are the problem and that you don't trust them, even if  that's how you feel. It sounds too much like a typical teen  ager blaming their parents   for everything wrong in  their  life and will probably not be taken seriously. You want to focus on what you've been doing and  how you feel. Just tell them you don't know why and you want a medical health professional to help you. That's where you can freely express how your parents are playing a role in these problems to someone objective and non judgmental. You shouldn't have to live the way you've been living.|`|xOqefUvtaa	typically if you're endangering your life or the life of another, a counselor will tell your parents (if you're under 18.)|`|FfMv8pipaa	Maybe not to students or parents, but I highly doubt she will keep her mouth shut in the office. Of course, your counselor might be different from mine, my school counselor likes to tell everyone in the front office what went on while she was talking to a student.

She was telling every teacher in there that two guys had kissed in the hallway.<br>  If you'd like to her to keep her mouth shut, ask her if she would keep it shut from absolutely everyone, even the staff. She has no right spreading your business around, so if you find out that she has been, tell her you'd appreciate it if she didn't, or find a therapist who can help you. They tend to be more quiet about things than a counselor. Even if you don't want your parents to know, you should still feel comfortable with someone that they aren't going to tel anyone what you two talk about.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Better mention the parent point to the councilor too, because to my mind, that would be the first people she would have approached - your parents.<br>  <br>  She is looking out for you, and also for the safety of all the school.....for you may go off the deep end and come to school with a loaded carbine and start shooting.<br>  <br>  So you see her position.

gmgfwXbJaa	Benefits<br>  It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression, stress and lead to a higher sense of self-worth. Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other – in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.<br>  <br>  Mutual masturbation, the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the "map to [their] pleasure centers". By watching a partner masturbate, one finds out the methods they use to please him- or herself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched.<br>  <br>  In 2003, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council Australia concluded that frequent masturbation by males appears to help prevent the development of prostate cancer. The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculation through sexual intercourse because intercourse can transmit diseases that may increase the risk of cancer instead. However, this benefit may be age related. A 2008 study concluded that frequent masturbation, at a rate of about two to seven times a week, between the ages of 20 and 40, is correlated with higher risk of developing prostate cancer. On the other hand, masturbation at a rate of once per week, in one's 50s, was found to be correlated with a lower such risk.<br>  <br>  A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.<br>  <br>  The association between frequency of orgasm and all cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recorded as number of orgasms per year. The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 0.64 (0.44 to 0.95).<br>  <br>  That is, a difference in mortality appeared between any two subjects when one subject ejaculated at around two times per week more than the other. Assuming a broad range average of between 3 to 5 ejaculations per week for healthy males, this would mean 5 to 7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with a 2003 Australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Support for such a view, and for making it part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders during the Clinton administration.<br>  <br>  Sexual climax, from masturbation or otherwise, leaves one in a relaxed and contented state. This is frequently followed closely by drowsiness and sleep – particularly when one masturbates in bed.<br>  <br>  Some professionals consider masturbation to function as a cardiovascular workout. Though research is still as yet scant, those suffering from cardiovascular disorders (particularly those recovering from myocardial infarction, or heart attacks) should resume physical activity (including sexual intercourse and masturbation) gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow. This limitation can serve as encouragement to follow through with physical therapy sessions to help improve endurance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blood pressure<br>  Both sex and masturbation lower blood pressure. A small study has shown that in one test group, recent full intercourse resulted in the lowest average blood pressure in stressful situations. Masturbation then led to lower blood pressure than did no recent sexual activity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pregnancy<br>  Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see mutual masturbation) can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva. Masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids.<br>  <br>  Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for third party reproductive procedures such as artificial insemination and IVF which may involve the use of either partner or donor sperm.<br>  <br>  <br>  Problems for males<br>  A man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma or injury during intercourse may rarely sustain a penile fracture[45] or suffer from Peyronie's disease.[46] Phimosis is "a contracted foreskin (that) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back".[47] In these cases, any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Compulsive masturbation<br>  Sigmund Freud argued that every normal child usually experiments with many types of autoerotic sexual stimulation. Social repressions of sexuality reached their peak in the Victorian era when popular authors wrote books threatening young children with mental deficiency or insanity if they indulged in any form of masturbation. There is no scientific evidence of any causative relationship between autoeroticism and any form of mental diso|`|bEVhDE9Raa	no u idiot.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Usually for men it is a great way NOT to get cancer.

gklfvgTxaa	I used faint at the site of any blood but now I just faint at the site of my own. I don't know why. When I used to see other people bleeding or getting a blood test, I would think of what's happening to their body, for example if their getting a blood test I picture the needle going into their vein and then when I actually see the blood coming out that's when I start to feel faint. I also think it's the colour and the fact that it came out of a person and should still be there.<br>  <br>  It's strange, but I just get really freaked out by anything that's wrong with the human body. When I was in high school we had a lecture on hepatitis B and I stood up to go outside cause I knew I was going to faint and then collapsed on my teacher in front of my entire year. It was so embarrassing.<br>  <br>  Usually what happens to me is I see the blood and then all of a sudden I feel extremely dizzy, my mouth goes really dry (even if someone gives me water it still feels dry) my sight goes blurry and if someones talking to me or there's any noise, it sounds like it's really far away and I can barely understand it, after that I'm out. To me the worst part of passing out is when my hearing goes (it's the strangest sensation, you have to go through it to understand how it feels) and the dizziness because it's so intense that everytime it happens all I want is to just hurry up and black out.|`|5qKjaq1Daa	everything is in their mind.  example. my husband was one of them, until, I got operated, then every time he sees blood, he said to me, wait, Im about to faint. oh. I can't see it, oh, I can't smell it, then he got used to it and everything went away. Now he sees blood and it's like nothing!
ii1AtjJ9aa	you were probably really focused and all of your muscles were tense, including your face and jaw muscles.  that's my educated guess :)|`|sAEYkNSqaa	Probably just a hard tackle has hurt your jaw don't worry it's not broken as you would not be able to move it.
iAPHAAinaa	There most certainly is. When you watch enough porn, your perception of women and sex become warped, and you start to think that those fantasy scenes are what actually happens in real life. However, pornography is not real life sex at all. So, when you do have real-life sex, those fantasies get in the way and so you're "let down," the actual sex does not live up to your expectations. Also, you say you masturbate daily. It takes the average male ages 18-40 about 4 hrs. until they're fully ready to ejaculate again. I know this sounds kinda silly but you may just be physically fatigued. My advice to you would be to get help with your pornography addiction and focus on real-life relationships. Also, when you are physically engaged, don't think about anything. Completely focus on what you are doing and allow yourself to get lost in it. I'm sure you'll be fine :D|`|SsfnitjXaa	No.  You probably are feeling guilty about having sex or just using the girl for gratification.  You will know that you have a porn addiction when you can't go a day without it and when after you watching it you just feel terrible and feel like you have wasted time.  But still can't stop.<br>  <br>  Find someone you truly care about and your little problem will go away.|`|ToILKl6waa	Yes. Pornography is the driving factor. You want to make what you see real during intercourse because you get so aroused at porn. However, you have formed a completely exaggerated picture of what sex really is. Porn is something you should stay away from and realize it's not realistic. Try to not rush an orgasm and let time do its course. Also, stay away from the videos and use mind discipline and rewards to prevent you from keeping to the addiction. The quicker you cut down the pornography, the quicker you'll ejaculate.
66ea7c7927e8bcdb422c8e86d99c018eaa	yes, you shoudl see the dermatologist...in fact if your conditions still persists, there's a possibility that its caused by excess washing/cleansing...or perhaps it has to do with the weather. <br>  <br>  Just to share with you my similar experience (nose peeling), when I went Australia last year, my nose was also peeling alot, and I used moisturizer, it actually got worse, because my skin became "thinner and softer" with the moisturizer..Using the sunblock would have solved my problem then|`|I98iE7ybaa	Absolutely.|`|KeDY8hNvaa	yeah, maybe they can help you with your skin|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	yes... for best treatment., or maybe you can try search more information about skin on here <a href="http://myskincaresite.info" rel="nofollow">http://myskincaresite.info</a>

JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|9alN3sCTaa	no never heard of it.<br>  if you want to lose weight, focus on your mind. discipline yourself. find a passion. something u can do for hours and feel like minutes.<br>  there is NO SHORT CUT to good health and weight loss. its something you have to be disciplined and work at. NOT about taking pills.|`|QZuQe5rVaa	I am trying it and it is working really well for me. i am eating less food at mealtime and snacking less overall. It is really helping me control my sweet cravings too.  I bought it after I saw Dayna Devon raving about it in woman's world magazine. <br>  <br>  Also, I find that its actually less expensive than other programs because I don't have to buy any special prepackaged meals. you can order it at www.trysensa.com using the womans world discount code: WWORLD.<br>  <br>   There's also this blog I just found which gives a ton of feedback on Sensa: <a href="http://www.diydietplan.com/blog/." rel="nofollow">http://www.diydietplan.com/blog/.</a>|`|lZImmwpDaa	Don't waste your time and money. Try phentramin-d by lazarus labs. See how many people lost weight.|`|7KVEWQB5aa	I recommend running in the morning to start your metabolism and running say after school or work. Just run 20-25 each time and you'll look great!
5xnWdlTxaa	I hope alternative medicine is a best choice for you, because acupressure, reflexology can be done by your self without money and home remedies can be followed without or with little money and homeopathy which is cheaper than allopathic drug also without any side effects.|`|a3bq277Gaa	No. Hospitals can't refuse you just because you don't have insurance. They should actually help you more because you're not working.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better!
wlIuELPIaa	I work for a non profit hospital and if you go to the emergency room for treatment they cannot turn you away. They MUST TREAT YOU! DO NOT take No for an answer.My Caps are not ment to be shouting. I just want you to get the care you need like all Americans should Insurance or Not. Socialized medicine is'nt a bad idea if you ask me, but then how would the Whole health care industry get Mega rich? Also, as long as you pay your Dr's bills, Hospital bills ($5.00 a month) they cannot affect your credit history or reports.Hope that sheds some light for you|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I'm sorry my friend but I don't see a problem here.You're under a lot of stress and your B/P diastolic is a little high. Just call your doctor and speak with his nurse. She/he'll relay the message and get back to you. No need to see the doctor. Just monitor your B/P often. If it gets up to that first level again go to the ER.<br>  God bless.
RMmh0aimaa	It sounds like you pulled a muscle or two. If you had injured your back you would most likely have shooting pains down your legs.<br>  <br>  It may take a while to go away. Try getting a professional massage - don't go for a cheap one just in case there is something wrong with your back - you don't want to make it worse.<br>  <br>  If you are getting shooting pains down your legs then you may have a pinched nerve which may not be good. Get it checked out at a physiotherapist.|`|OyZUVaauaa	you pulled a muscle. You played to much but didn't stretch. Just rest for 4-6 days and it should get better, if doesn't see a doctor.|`|I5Qd4yqJaa	Hello, you might have muscle strain injury to the back.Overuse muscle disorder or pressure on a nerve root.Have a physical examination,focused on the back and abdomen,extremities may confirm back pain or muscle spasm. Rest for 2to5 days.Use pain medication nsaid such as ibuprofen.You can use some ice on it too.20 minutes at a time,wait 20 minutes do it again. you could use some heat on it.
Z4QbQt3Xaa	The secret to weight control is to reduce the sugar & starch intake.<br>  The biggest culprits are soft-drinks & fast foods.|`|AA11117029	You can loose about 10 pounds for a healthy weight range, but your weight right now is in a healthy state. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	you loose weight if you eat less calories than your body needs to survive. Unless there is a health problem.

M2XQMPNNaa	Reach out to a counselor and get some guidance. It is entirely possible this is normal teenage mood cycling OR it could be a side effect of a depression or anxiety or something else all together!. Either way, starting in with a counselor will give you a safe, private place to voice your fears and struggles and the counselor can help guide you to more help if you need it. There is no sense or benefit to just struggling through and hoping this situation changes or miraculously gets better, reach out for help, you'll be glad you did.|`|WtMYXIvuaa	This must be a terrible place to be in for you. My suggestion to you would be to make an appointment with a psychologist.  It might seem frightening at first but this problem seems to be causing you distress and proper help could make the world of difference in your life...I guarantee you that!  Life is too short to be feeling this way and I really hope you find this helpful.|`|a3bq277Gaa	Maybe you need to talk to someone about this? <br>  Your boyfriend, a best friend?|`|HBUO10i7aa	I'M SORRY TOO....YOU NEED TO BE UNDER A DOCTORS CARE AND ON SOME MEDICATION THAT WILL HELP YOU COPE BETTER WITH LIFE....BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE MOVE TO HELP YOURSELF!

People may think you are crazy are wierd for just bursting spontaneosly. But its normal. It's worse to hold on to something sad, that causes depresson.|`|oonQOuPsaa	Yes, it is very normal to cry, therefore if it wasn't, why would humans be able to do it? and why is it a part of basically everyday life?<br>  <br>  answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsL9KYXBtPDbiYV_Lme3Snnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307175236AALUBtX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|cku5S9WLaa	Crying is a good way to release stress.|`|J4BxsLSXaa	Awwww I see ur point =S yup its a little kind of not ok but u know u need to let it out try taking to ur parents :)|`|M8uQ3LS7aa	yeah its okay to cry just dont take it to far you know what i mean...it might creep people out. but i no crying is good thats why when people cry they tell you to let it out it will lift stress and whats bothering you off your shoulders.|`|34OtFOE7aa	sometimes i cry too! even its for no reason...maybe im just in a bad mood...but sometimes it feels good. sometimes at night i cry or i just cry becuz i cant keep it all in.
q8cBE6w8aa	The link below seems like very good advice to me.  You might like to look up good sources of information on pregnancy on the internet.<br>  <br>  Hoping you feel better soon, and wishing you and the baby the best of everything.<br>  <br>  Johnny.|`|KfBQOgQLaa	EAT THE PAIN AWAY<br>  <br>  (I suggest a nice Turkey, lettuce, American cheese with ranch dressing sandwich at Subway)|`|JpPnRW84aa	They wont stop until like 5 months
bxxwhP04aa	A good way to fight fungus is to stop eating things that are full of sugar.  Fungus organisms feed on sugars.  Another thing you can do is get a bottle of acidophilus capsules or tablets at a health food store, or Walmart, and take them as directed on the bottle.  The acidophilus organisms tend to kill fungus.  Another thing is to put some anti-fungal cream on that area, you can buy this at drugstores or Walmart.  I would do all three things at once if I were you.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	You may need anti fungal tablets, this kills the fungus so it wont come back(the same one)but you can easily catch it from somewhere else.|`|xktBgoKFaa	They can come back if you expose them to the fungus again. Use a strong anti-fungal cream and use it for the entire prescribed period.
g8pRhElsaa	ortho tricyclen lo definitely helps my skin (i'm on it right now, and it's awesome), but honestly, yaz helped a LOT more. on yaz, i didn't even break out when i was PMSing. ortho helps my skin a lot, and it shouldn't have any harm long term, so i say go ahead and try it!<br>  <br>  however, i wouldn't try it without seeing a doctor. even if you don't have insurance, you can go to planned parenthood, and they probably won't even charge you.
9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	The optic nerve wouldn't allow it to stretch that far!<br>  Interesting thought though!|`|RMmh0aimaa	Do a search on youtube - there are videos that show this.<br>  <br>  However having said that, the eye vibrates which enables it to see. If you hold it perfectly still all we can see is white.|`|NGfxDny2aa	Out of the dislodged eye? Not sure. I don't see why not. (no pun intended) You would definitely be able to see out of the other eye....but why would you want to do this?
9pLdhuBnaa	This sounds like something more than a sprain is going on.  However, I would recommend getting another opinion to see what they think could be going on.
NX9Dj2qraa	Could be a number of reasons:<br>  - For me it was when my boobs were growing<br>  - But it could also be your bra/clothing has aggrivated the skin, maybe just wear some loose clothing till it sorts itself out<br>  <br>  Just dont worry, itll sort itself out either way. Youve just gotta put up with the annoyance of the itching! xx|`|ioPSpuOIaa	its because they r growing it happens to most people|`|7zBUVlccaa	This happened to me too! (: <br>  Its nothing to worry about. Well, for me, that happened and then I got my periods a few months later. So, it could be the start of puberty for you, meaning your boobs will start growing (or, if you already have 'um, they will get bigger)<br>  Or it could be that you are using a washing powder thats making you itch.. im guessing its not this though if its only your nipples that are itchy. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped, because I know how you feel. <br>  Have a great day, and dont worry :D<br>  ~rweo x|`|KmmVhKlbaa	have you started you periods? This is a sign that you might start. Hope you find a solution :)|`|wydxVDpQaa	It could be that your bra is too small ! you should get it profesionally measured ! Good Luck Hun! x

GTECgHx7aa	The only way to loose weight is to exercise and by eating healthy. I'm totally not saying diet. <br>  Go on youtube they have so many workout videos and they are all free.
dgKLiAN1aa	Is it to the side a bit? (Not directly in the middle)<br>  <br>  I have something like that. It's about half a centimeter big, like a round ball thing. I went to the doctors and it turns out its a lympthnode. Theyre apparantly these little fat filtering things or something like that that can get blocked up sometimes. Nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Anyway, in my opion thats proberbly what it is. Most people have them but never notice them. (you'll really only notice it if your quite thin/slender as it sits around fatty tissue, so if you have nearly non it shows up).<br>  <br>  However I'd suggest you goto the doctor just to get it checked out, can't be too careful. But I wouldn't worry about it|`|vLSHbEboaa	yes. it is too high for pregnancy. i am right now taking health and we were learning about the bones. it is probably the xiphoid process. do not press on it. because that could really hurt you. get it checked out just in case.
SQLSOeHcaa	Yes!<br>  Stomach cancer can easily spread and become unoperable, I'm so sorry about your aunt:-(<br>  <br>  Stage I: Stage I is slightly more advanced. There are two possible criteria of this stage:<br>  <br>  Cancer is found in the second or third layers of the stomach and has not spread to the lymph nodes near the location of the cancer, or<br>  <br>  Cancer is in the second layer of the stomach and has spread to lymph nodes very close to the tumor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stage II: Stage II is slightly more advanced than Stage I. In this stage, three conditions may be found:<br>  <br>  Cancer is in the second layer of the stomach wall and has spread to lymph nodes further away from the tumor, or<br>  <br>  Cancer is only in the muscle layer (the third layer) of the stomach and has spread to lymph nodes very close to the tumor, or<br>  <br>  Cancer is in all four layers of the stomach wall but has not spread to lymph nodes or other organs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stage III: Stage III is slightly more advanced than Stage II. In this stage, any of the following may be found:<br>  <br>  Cancer is in the third layer of the stomach wall and has spread to lymph nodes further away from the tumor, or<br>  <br>  Cancer is in all four layers of the stomach wall and has spread to lymph nodes either very close to the tumor or further away from the tumor.<br>  <br>  Cancer is found in all four layers of the stomach wall and has spread to nearby tissues. The cancer may or may not have spread to lymph nodes very close to the tumor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stage IV: In Stage IV stomach cancer, the cancer has spread to nearby tissues and to lymph nodes further away from the tumor, or it has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis).|`|7e02335d8db7a10c3a3a227b20d16521aa	Unfortunately yes it can happen.  Cancer varies in its aggressiveness, rate of cell replication, rate of invasion etc.  Cancer can be spread via the bloodstream, local extension, through the lymph or by mechanical spread.  Many gastric (stomach) malignancies are very aggressive meaning that they spread quickly and if left untreated take a life quickly.  I am sorry about your aunt.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Stomach cancer spreads very quickly and most patients have less than six months to live when they are diagnosed.  That time can be extended with chemotherapy and sometimes surgery, but it's still a very aggressive cancer and very difficult to beat.|`|AA10063059	yes easily,that has just happened to jade goody in the UK ,she was diagnosed last august and now she is in her final week sadly
Qk3BeU1Saa	Treatment of ovarian cysts depends on:<br>   * your age, <br>   * whether you have been through the menopause, <br>   * the appearance and size of the cyst<br>   * whether there are symptoms.<br>  <br>  so it can't be clear with just few words. you can check some pro websites first.

It should grow a few more inches before you turn 18, so don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  As for the way it looks, etc. I don't see any reason about complaining about it, most porn stars don't have foreskin, I'm not quite sure why but it's just less of a hassle I suppose. I don't either so I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.

LKsl00CTaa	Yes. Sleep paralysis is only terrifying the first few times you get it. You start panicking and have trouble breathing, and it takes a monumentous amount of will power just to move your pinky to wake up. Parts of the "dream world" start to mix with your perception of whats really happening although you are fully aware that you are dreaming. You begin to hallucinate, like trying to shout out to someone for help even though you're alone and cannot really shout. After the first few times however, you get used to the feeling and just go with it, relaxing a little. This can even turn into a lucid dream of sorts. Writing this just makes me want to do it again, it always happens when i'm sleep deprived.<br>  <br>  All in all, if you ever experience it (i've heard everyone does at least once) it probably won't be an enjoyable experience. Unknown Identity.|`|rK1nSum8aa	I haven't ever really gotten sleep paralysis except once. Its not too creepy but at the time I was terrified.<br>  Well I was really young (Like seven or so) and my Grandma worked at a place where they made dolls (The real porcelain kind too) well anyway she would always make me dolls so I had a bunch of dolls on this shelf that was on the wall right across my bed. One night I woke up and I see the doll's heads moving (You know in scary movie how "evil" things move? Like kind of twitching in a way?) well there heads were twitching all around like they were looking all over the room, it scared me so bad I tried to get up but I couldn't move at all! After about 30 seconds everything was normal. It was really weird but being seven and seeing dolls moving really freaks you out!
HwujORd2aa	It's winter-if you're living in a cold climate the air is dry and your nasal passages are drying out.  That's why it's showing up when you blow your nose, and it's dripping down your throat (like phlegm does when you have a cold.)  <br>  Try flushing your nasal passages with saline - not pleasant, but it feels better and moistens the nasal passages.  You can get ones for babies at the drugstore that are very easy to use.  <br>  If it doesn't improve and you are in fact coughing it up, see your doctor.  If you're really worried call him or her anyway.|`|yBgRDe9Vaa	Dang!!  If you are spitting up blood, get to the doctor PRONTO!!  Breathe in some steam from a boiling pot of water if you are dealing with dry heat (can cause sort of nose bleed)/or change of weather/virus, but it sounds worse than that!  Got some chicken noodle soup??  Put some Tabasco/hot sauce in it to get rid of that nose/chest flim.  I can't tell if it's a cold or not if you are spitting up blood!  Hemmorage in your esophogus??  Could be that nose draining down into your throat...best try I have at helping you!

AA11318851	Common recommendations are to run for 20-30 minutes 3x a week.  Resistance training (weights) have been shown to reduce body fat also. Your weight might not drop much because muscle weighs more than fat, but you'll look better.<br>  <br>  105 lbs already sounds like fairly low weight unless you're really short.<br>  <br>  Acai hasn't been shown to affect weight loss in any scientific study, BTW (regarding previous poster).

And walking isnt good enough, u need to exert urself to lose fat.<br>  <br>  25-35 mins a day 3-5 days a week|`|R3NtFnfdaa	Ok, if you are new to running, I would suggest that you walk  and jog together so that you won't wear yourself out since you are new to running. So try walking for 5 mins, and then  jog for 3 mins. Keep doing that till you get a total of 21 mins of jogging in, which means you'll have to jog 3 mins 7 times. and you will have walked 35 mins as well.<br>  21 plus 35= 56 mins of walking/jogging, which isn't bad.<br>  I started out doing it like this, and it helped me get into really good shape.<br>  Make sure you stretch real good before you run and after.<br>  Don't run everyday, run every other day because your body and muscles to relax and heal.|`|iTICaQFxaa	sprinting helps you loose wait the fastest sprint for 20 seconds then jog/speed walk to cool down then do it all over again.  o and you just need to burn more calories than u eat so do weights go normal jogging every day and just do cardio im 14  and i wanted to make my own workouts so when i tried the next day my whole body was sore try making your own! most likely youll over do it be sore as hell and if you do iit every day youll get thinner!|`|oARkQFEuaa	About jogging can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=jogging" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=jo...</a>

In moderation yes, it's packed with antioxidants and other nutrients that in moderation are good for you.  But more than a few cups per day and the health benefits get less and less.

1pxKM9Buaa	yeah it definitely sounds like you have extreme anxiety.<br>  there are some medicines you can take tho, i believe.<br>  if you think you have other disorders, i would see the doctor again and see what he/she diagnoses. the symptons might just be similar, and really you only have anxiety.<br>  <br>  best wishes.|`|LajVgGeAaa	It appears to me you are suffering from Somatization Disorder... What you just described, fits this category, however other factors must be present in order to be diagnosed. And I am not the one to do it, of course. I'll just make you aware that I believe this is a possibility of what you are suffering from. This disorder can be co-morbid with other psychological disorders such as anxiety disorders, which the docs say you have. <br>  <br>  Advice, should go see a psychologist and give them reference to the fact that you think you suffer from Somatization Syndrome, and then they will give you a test and things go from there.
LajVgGeAaa	It is not uncommon to develop feelings towards a therapist. But it is in the ethics code of being a psychologist not to have relations with clients outside of the therapy room, due to the common feelings clients tend to develop toward their therapist. These feelings develop in the clients because they see how their therapist "gets them" and are empathetic to their feelings on a higher basis then usual friends, because they are so in tune with their job and figuring out how to help you guys... My advice let your therapist know.. It isn't healthy to continue with sessions if you have these feelings. Unfortunately, your therapist would probably discontinue therapy with you because of the code she has to agree by. <br>  <br>  And about your question, crush can be legit, but remember.. you developed these feelings because of the nature of her psychology regime of understanding of clients feelings. It's what they are good at.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	welcome to my world lol...  i've being seeing my counsellor for a year and a bit.. and i am a lesbian... but she's not my usual type.  but i've noticed recently that i have began to have kinda sexual thoughts about her.. and u start to wonder.. do they think about me outside that hour?  the answer to myself is NO... lol...  we're just another client.

u8CFwtyMaa	Do it in the bath or shower - the hot water helps to soften the skin.<br>  Insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and gently stretch it - don't do it so much that it hurts, as this can cause micro tears, that then heal with scars - not what you want.<br>  It will take several weeks before you see any results, but keep it up daily and you'll get there<br>  Pulling the foreskin back whenever you pee will help, as will masturbating.<br>  Hope this helps|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	Here are some tips.<br>  <br>  Stretching is best done over a long period of time and a little at a time.  To increase results over less time you need to more often.  Always soak in a hot tub and use baby oil.<br>  <br>  Place two fingers.  The smaller diameter ones at first.  Pull the foreskin forward of the glans and insert the fingers.  Then pull the fingers apart form each other   The goal is to widen the opening especially on the tip.<br>  <br>  Later you can use marbles.  Marbles work good because they are inert.  Made of high impact glass.  You can get them in many sizes.  Start with a small one and graduate to bigger ones.   Aside from all this being safe..  Its fun.   You will feel a tingling when the stretching is working.  Go slow.. Stop if you feel too much pain.  You could tear things so be careful.<br>  <br>  Over about several months.  Perhaps three months or so.  You will see that now you can get a third finger in there.  Soon you will out grow your marbles thing too.  Be carefull on other objects.  They need to be smooth.  Safe from chipping or cracking, and be inert.   Inert means they have no interaction to you.  Metal balls can rust or cut.   The object should not be so tight as to cause any great deal of pain.  However over time many can.  If you reach this point stop for a while.  Let the body repair and start up again after a while.<br>  <br>  Soon you will be able to park a car in there bud...<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|e6Sn5bj2aa	the best thing to do is attach your forskin to a horny tortoise using rope or string. and then get another tortoise that really wants it....you know what i mean....then go to sleep...the Horny tortoise will slowly chase the "I want it bad" tortoise all around your house...and as you sleep youll get knocked about slowly like pinball...but slowly.....this will thus stretch the skin. allowing you to pull it back and forth normally like normal everyday normal humans....hopes this works for ya..|`|8yE2sYGeaa	It has to be held in place to facilitate the stretching|`|ZTs8QDUnaa	yes
GgClh7dbaa	Phenylalanine is an ingredient in aspartame, which is an artificial sweetener and is probably dangerous. But phenylalanine by itself is not a sweetener, and unless you were born with the rare disease phenylketonuria (PKU), it not only isn't dangerous, it is an essential amino acid necessary for building proteins. You can't live without it. Even people with PKU must have it, although they must limit their intake. Whatever is causing you to urinate is not phenylalanine. You should read the following:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mental-health.emedtv.com/phenylalanine/dangers-of-phenylalanine.html" rel="nofollow">http://mental-health.emedtv.com/phenylal...</a>
LWmo7lOpaa	The standard drug screen includes tests for morphine, codeine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM).<br>  <br>  Morphine will show up as just morphine, as it does not metabolize into codeine or 6-MAM.<br>  <br>  Codeine will show up as both codeine and morphine, as approximately 10% of a dose of codeine is metabolized into morphine.<br>  <br>  Heroin will show up as morphine, codeine, and 6-MAM. Heroin metabolizes into all three. 6-MAM is a metabolite specific to heroin, so its presence indicates that heroin was indeed used.
ifIRySXpaa	Soda is one of the worse foods out there that you could possibly ingest. Many people are addicted to certain foods and drinks because the companies put chemicals in them specifically to make the person addicted to them, to keep coming back for more, no matter how crappy it makes them feel afterwards. It's sad to say but a lot of food companies out there care more about the money they're making than the health of their customers. The best thing to do is eat REAL Food, not the stuff packaged in colorful boxes in the aisles, but the produce found on the walls of the grocery stores - fruits and vegetables are the most important, and it's important to eat whole grains, not refined and bleached nutrient-less products. I know how easy it is to run into a fast food store, order your favorite item that's cheap and comes already made, hot and ready for you to eat, and hang out with some friends while chowing down on this delicious food you always crave, but it's so damaging to your health. Be in control of your body and your cravings! And be healthy.<br>  <br>  I'm glad to hear you exercise a lot, it's important to stay active. But nutrition is even more important. It's the most important thing in your life, because it IS life. I'm glad that you're trying to eat healthy, but please understand something: Eating healthy doesn't mean eating low-fat products that have little calories. Not at all! For some reason many people believe that calories and fats are enemies to the body - they're very necessary for your body to function properly! Don't switch to diet soda, in certain ways it's worse because it has a whole new list of chemicals and sweeteners added to it! (BTW, eating just two slices of bread with meat is not the best choice. Eating grains with meats isn't a good idea because the foods don't digest properly, and eating white bread is not good). The most important thing to consider when it comes to buying and eating food, is the INGREDIENTS. What is that food made of? Most "foods" founds in grocery stores are loaded with chemicals, sweeteners, sodium, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and most fast food stores have addictive chemicals and sugars and sodium in their food. Did you know there's beef product in McDonald fries? Two good rules of thumb: If you can't pronounce it, don't eat it. And The less ingredients, the better. Fast food is dangerous because the stores make it sound like the food there is normal and healthy to eat, and it IS convenient and cheap, at a price : your health. Not to mention the animals that produce the meat for restaurants are often very poorly treated, as well as the environment. <br>  <br>  There is So Much to consider, but I'm about to run out of typing space. I'd be very glad to help you out! (I hope I didn't sound too negative and crazy there...) I'll be sending more information to you through e-mail after this. If you're interested, take a look at my blog about eating healthy and making smart food choices <a href="http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/," rel="nofollow">http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/,</a> I'm sure you can find some useful information there! Making changes like the ones listed there will help your body So Much, you'll feel much better, you'll lose excess water weight, if you often get headaches you might lose most of those as well as your cravings. After eating healthy wholesome foods for a while you'll get used to the lack of salt and sugars and you might actually prefer it because your tastebuds won't be over-hyped with all the sugars and chemicals it used to get. Let me know if you have any questions, and good luck! =)|`|NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join.

Switching from regular soda to diet would be an easy way to drop the amount calories that you consume each day. I look at like would I rather drink those calories or eat something that could actually satisfy my hunger. I cut all liquid calories out of my diet. There  are a couple of ways to ease the switch. The easiest way is to start mixing the diet version of the soda that you drink with its regular version, gradually increasing the amount of diet.<br>  <br>  Also, try keeping fruits and 100 calorie snack packs in the house. The fruits are good for you and the 100 cal packs taste great and you know that you will be only eating 100 calories of it at a time. Just be sure to stop after 1 bag!! Good luck!
DYbAZo7Xaa	kill him|`|45169f2ce4948ae5a6d9d7c74c21aae2aa	There really isn't a lot that you can do. All that you need to do is watch baby doesn't go off his / her feeds and watch for a temperature. If this happens, just take little one to your GP. I wouldn't worry to much, kids are pretty resilient to these things and if not, they do get over them pretty quick. xxxx
eAhz7Hptaa	Nothing wrong with having a pantyhose fetish at all. You could be doing a lot worse, with all the disgusting and even harmful fetishes out there. Just accept and embrace it as part of your life. You should not let it take over your life though, to the extent that you can’t function normally anymore. What I mean to say is that it should not become a total obsession.<br>  From what you say I guess that you get extremely turned on by wearing pantyhose, which is quite normal. Let’s be honest, pantyhose are very sexy. And it’s better to masturbate in your pantyhose than for example rape someone. But it is good to exercise some self-control, so maybe you should stop wearing them before or when you go to your classes. After all there is a time and place for everything. And when your pantyhose wearing influences you negatively during class, it’s better to go without them there. There will still be enough time and opportunity to enjoy it in your free time, at home and so on. To stop wearing them altogether is of course not a solution and there is no reason for it. You’ll still want to wear them and you’ll only be frustrated. But enjoy it at times and places where it doesn’t affect the other aspects of your life in a negative way.|`|zX80VRbmaa	You should exercise more self-control.  Understand why you are wearing pantyhose.  If you are wearing to get a sexual high, then stop wearing them.  <br>  <br>  However, if you are wearing them to provide warmth, to help circulation in legs, to hide imperfection on legs, then by all means wear pantyhose for those benefits.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...</a>|`|3t3aVj1Laa	I also have the same fetish, and Its better to masturbate in your pantyhose then stalk or force some one to have sex with you.<br>  Don't do it in public, and all will be well :)|`|24228cff46f2ae4a925387c435dea376aa	I see nothing wrong with this fetish. Pantyhose IS something sexy and can be very erotic. I Too feel aroused wearing hosiery. However, IF your are feeling lethargic. then yes perhaps you should stop wearing them. But only if it's a health issue.|`|tSi10jneaa	I hoe you are a girl outthere.<br>  By the way I don't like pantyhose.<br>  Best solution if you think it's gets a control of your life is to dump them all in a garbage bin forever.<br>  All the best.|`|ME7wd3zRaa	i seriously hope  u r a girl|`|YTasscmKaa	You have to have some self control and, maybe think about not wearing pantyhose when you're going to class.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	You are young and inexperienced.  Most guys come quickly at your age.  There are ways to slow it down.  Masturbate before at your age you should be ready in a short time later.  Think of negative things when you are too excited like basebal statistics, your next exam etc.  Don't dwell on the issue.  If you come too fast just wait a few minutes to get another erection and continue on.  The more sex you have the longer you will last.|`|imhCQYy0aa	You should masturbate more . And after you *** while having sex u should lick her nipples or something so that you get hard again|`|FI916ISFaa	Worry less about your sexual performance (it will get better) and more on that atrocious spelling and grammar of yours.

I do a lot of squats and ab exercises.  I also cut out all the carbs, keep fruits to a minimum and eat lots of green vegies.|`|AA11878029	it would strenghten your arms !!!|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	Pullups are exercise and build muscle. <br>  Any time you exercise, you burn calories, which will help you lose weight.<br>  Any muscle you build will help you burn more calories, which will help you lose weight.<br>  So, pullups are fine.<br>  <br>  But, you should do other forms of exercise, too, like walking or running or playing a sport, or using a Wii. You want to get your heart rate up and exercise for more than 30 minutes per day. It does not have to be 30 minutes in a row. 10 minutes here and there will work. More than 30 a day is even better. Ideally, an hour or more of exercise would be good. Park at the other end of the lot. Take the stairs. Put the wastebasket 10 feet from your desk, so that you have to get up to throw something away. Do everything you can do get more exercise.<br>  <br>  Drink more water. It helps your body use up your fat.<br>  <br>  And, as you know, eat less food, but eat more often so that your blood sugar will stay stable. Fill yourself up with fruits and vegetables or soup. Eat a little protein each day and make sure that you have a balanced diet. Maybe even take some vitamins. Cut down on the refined carbohydrates, such as bagels, pasta and white breads. Forget the fries. Read boxes and labels to see how many calories are really in that big burger that you got from Carl's Jr. or the Stauffer's Lasagne. <br>  <br>  I can tell that you are a person who once they set their mind to something, will do it. If you have a friend who also wants to lose weight, buddy up with them and you can help them stick with it while you make it more fun for yourself .|`|tIldpr7vaa	couldnt hurt, but cardio is the best exercise for weight loss|`|3061ed3a2f1d09c904ae44f8dc455d7daa	No.|`|FliqRZIFaa	doing pull ups will improve your arm strength.<br>  if you wana loose wieght. go to the gym and run. to burn fat cells.<br>  and you have to diet correctly. <br>  fish<br>  meat<br>  fruit<br>  vegetables<br>  and food that are high in protein.|`|000b3f9044922cd60d823df37a04f16faa	I've never heard such a question before.<br>  I personally won't do that because 1. it doesnt work, 2. it's kind of embarrising and 3. well YOUR NOT LOOSING ANY WEIGHT. !|`|HtjakUZXaa	Overall excercise would lose weight but when you are doing pull ups, you are gaining muscle.

They're more for upper body strength. Try eating healthier and no snacks. Just 3 times a day. no chips, chocolate or anything. After you eat, go for a walk, NOT JOG. Do that for 2 weeks and I guarantee that you will lose some weight.|`|uoHkecplaa	I don't think so, pull-ups help you gain muscle, which weighs more than fat. You won't lose weight, but you WILL look stronger.

IyOpqpslaa	Once an animal is down the predatory animals attack the abdomen where the large blood vessels are. Once the large blood vessels are opened and the animal bleeds out, it's dead. It's a process of about 5 minutes for a large animal.<br>  <br>  Supposedly, animals that are subject to being eaten by other animals have a sort of mental anesthesia/analgesia that takes over when they're attacked and being consumed before they expire. How true that is, i'm not sure, but hopefully it is true.|`|AA10351712	Not long at all.  Hyenas  have incredibly powerful jaws.   And before too long,  the animal being eaten will  bleed out and be unconscious.|`|GmVR2CxGaa	depends on how long it takes for the hyena to lacerate the head or vital organs. hahahaha|`|oARkQFEuaa	About being eaten alive can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=being%20eaten%20alive" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=be...</a>|`|NtFWoBHsaa	All of the men that I have eaten alive are still walking around.  haha<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, Frank, no need to be crude.
cASB8Sh3aa	You should join a social networking site so you can talk to pumpers and review questions that have been asked already.  There is a list serv which all communications are done via email at www.insulinpumpers.org.  There is a true social networking site called www.tudiabetes.com where there are forums and groups you can join to get feedback from other diabetics.

aiBOMU9kaa	The TV is over 3 feet away, so you are using your distance vision and the lens of your eyes are relaxed, so there is no problem with TV, or videos.<br>  <br>  As for computer, all you can do is take very frequent breaks to look away, like you say you have been doing. That helps to reduce strain.<br>  <br>  I have been on a computer 6 or 8 hours a day for over 10 years, and don't need glasses. <br>  <br>  There is no proof the computer causes any problems with vision, either you have it in your genes to be nearsighted or you don't.<br>  <br>  There does seem to be proof though, that  in young people, lots of close work with glasses on can cause nearsightedness to progress faster. Be it computer or reading. That is for those who already wear glasses. In other words, it is better not to wear them for extended close work.|`|GbBSA3Cgaa	You actually can't. It's an urban legend. Watching too much T.V. can cause eye strain for a short period of time, but that's about it.

TmPiF9hcaa	ive never worn brace's before so i wouldn't know what you are  going through. But the way that you have described it maybe a baby pink or suttle blue would be nice :) and regarding your hair you said that it is thick and curly if you have a hair straighener get it cut short and a  full frindge in the front, i to have very thick and curly hair i had it shirt and it was so easy to manage. good luck.|`|XQiuY4XIaa	i've got braces and nobody notices them .. well ok for the first few days or maybe a week people were say 'oh you you've got braces' or 'when did you get braces'? but after a week or two nobody even notices.

Just go for a pale colour baby blue or pink or got for a brighter one!|`|5GcmU8gNaa	I 11 years old and i am wondering what colour to get for my braces as well.

Very thick, dark, and super curly. I just pull my bangs back around my ears with a split on the side...or even a zigzag split is cute. Then, I put a leave in conditioner in it and let it dry. As it's drying, I kind of mess with it so that it dries big and really curly. A lot of people are often impressed with all the curls, they say it looks "sassy". Try that. Hope i helped! =]|`|WXcbE2H1aa	wow. calm down. you are stressing about this wayyyyy too much. i just had my braces off, the colour and your haircut, doesn't matter. people will see you, and your braces, and accept that that is who you are. its only for a year or so. and you will have amazing teeth at the end of it.|`|YLLOTkcZaa	I don't know if this is an option for you or not, but my hair is similar and I straighten my hair with a CHI straightener on a daily basis.
