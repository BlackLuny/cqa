20090131143822AAz9eLU	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Questions about how to look after my orchid (phalaenopsis)?	I bought an orchid a few days ago, and I asked the shopkeeper some questions about how to care for it, but when she explained, she seemed to assume I already knew some things about keeping plants, I don't know a thing about how to care for them, so she left me with questions!    I've been watering it every three days in the evening, leaving it overnight, and then draining the excess water in the morning, to stop its roots from rotting. I've been keeping it in my bedroom, which is usually quite warm because I spend most of my time in here, and fairly humid because it's small, sealed off and I do a lot of breathing in here! And I'm keeping it about a metre away from the window, where there is ambient sunlight, but the sun isn't directly cast onto it. I was also told to feed it once a month with half-strength house plant fertiliser.    My questions are, though -  1. When it isn't flowering, do I still water and feed it with the same regularity? Does is still need to be at the same temperature and light levels?  2. When it isn't flowering, should I cut the tip off to encourage is to grow more flowers?    Thanks in advance :)

We prolly ate a hundred figs and the birds prolly ate about the same.      So I'm pruning the tree and the largest branch shoots about 15 foot high.  If I leave it, the tree will only grow higher of course.  But perhaps I leave those figs for the birds and eat those at arm's length?  What's your experience of pruning fig trees?      Other than netting the tree, I don't know how else to keep out the birds.

It's like brown, the size of a penny, and has a very hard shell around it making it hard to squish so I have to put it outside if I'm nice or just flush it. I've had 3 appear in my room throughout the year and I think it actually can fly based on how the last one hit my desk. They are easy for me to catch and get rid of since they are slow and don't react. Well anyways, the shell is hard enough to hear the clank when it hits the desk which is why I generally am alerted of it's presence.     Any identification of what this and how to make them stop appearing?

I need to fix my bookcase (so something that could help me with that) Also my room has this one part where the hurricanes ruined my carpet. When the people built our house we noticed there were alot of cracks including when through my window sill. The hurricanes hit florida and because i havent been up there since then we didnt notice but the water that seeped through ruined a little edge of my carpet (anyway to fix that?)

I like the smells of most air fresheners but I am not sure how safe most of the brands that you find in stores really are. Does anyone know of any brands that are trustworthy and smell great?    Polite, constructive, relevant answers only please.

We live in WA, we usually keep our home temperature at about 72 degree (F). Is it enough? It's kinda cold during winter. We did try to crank it up to sometime 75 but the heating bill is too much. Any advice?       Thanks.
