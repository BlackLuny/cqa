20081120053811AAXYufa	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Why do doctors always try to force sedation on a patient for a colonoscopy? ?	Thank God I found two Dr's that give the patient the option to have or not to have sedation and/or pain medication for this procedure. I've had one all ready and it's NOT a painful procedure at all. The worst part was when the Dr went around the sigmoid, I felt a small cramp that went away in less than 2 seconds. They put numbing gel on the scope so you DON'T feel anything.   Is it because most people are squeamish and are scared of the slightest discomfort? On a scale of 1-10 of pain, this procedure w/o the use of sedation or drugs is between a 1-2.

I am asking because I will need a fusion on my spine soon and will stop taking pain killers slowly. I have heard that pain killers produce endorphins for you , so your brain kind of stops producing it. After I stop the pain killers, will my brain ever produce endorphins on it's own again, like before I took the pain killers? I have been taking them for 2 years now. 8 Lortab per day. I know I will need to come off slow to avoid bad with drawls , but I am concerned about being depressed forever after stopping. I just want to know if I can ever feel happy again on my own after stopping. I already take anti depressants. Thanks!

I had been on the pill for a few years now, two different brands, and the newer one calmed down my depression but made my periods wacky. I had heavy spotting twice a month along with my period, so i pretty much had a period 2-3 times a month. I wanted normality. So they said I could get the depo.   The side effects I had been reading made me laugh, cuz it seems worse than getting pregnant, but fearful! Depression, horrible mood swings, loss of sex drive, extreme weight gain, hair falling out, increase of heart attacks and strokes.. what could be worse?   What are my chances of getting these side effects? anyone out there can comfort me?

20090227050717AArkA7Z	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Scratched eye, do I need to see doctor?	Last night, I was getting out of the car carrying a drink and accidentally put the straw in my eye.  It wasn't really hard and the injury isn't really bad.  Other than looking mildly bloodshot in the area, there is nothing you can see with the naked eye.  However, I'm sure I must have scratched the surface.  It is quite sore and very sensitive to light and air, feeling like there is something in my eye constantly.      Since it's not that bad (ie: no blood, no brusing), is this something I should see a doctor for?  Or am I OK to just treat it at home?  If so, what can I do ease the discomfort?
20090227050805AA5kVhr	Health;Mental Health	Help!!! People who have or know about PTSD- I'm having a nightmare, are my memories reliable?	OK, I don't actually have PTSD, but I am severely borderline and have a lot of psychiatric problems. I've had extremely violent dreams for years- in just about every dangerous place in the world (Iraq, the Congo, North Korea) and in these creepy alternate realities. I've consistently dreamt of being sexually abused, of being raped (though it felt more like oral sex than real rape) or of being chased by rapists, shooting my friends in Nazi death camps to stay alive, being stabbed, watching people's hands get cut off... But these *weren't* nightmares. I never felt that feeling of horror, it was sort of detached and every time I wrote them down, it was calm and methodical.      Well now I've had a real nightmare. The actual dream shouldn't seem nearly as terrifying as what I've just described, but the feeling of the dream was so horrific... Probably the most important scene was me desperately trying to communicate something to my brother, but my voice suddenly took on this hideous manly rasping quality, it scared the **** out of him and I couldn't tell him something that was vitally important... Something horrific had just happened that I was trying to make sense of, and then I lost control over my body- it started jerking around like a seizure, and the room was in shambles around me. There were cats in the dream; seems minor, but I haven't had real nightmares since I was four, and I remember the cats clearly then too. I can't even tell you how scary this was.      But this is my question. The dream was *so* familiar, scene for scene, and when I woke up I had this dead certainty that I had dreamt it many times before. I had other little fragments that came back to me right after I woke up- things that I had not just dreamt, but that I just knew were other parts of the same dream I had had before.  It was like I had just dreamt a tiny fragment of a familiar dream... And most importantly, I was dead certain that I had written it down recently, but somehow I had *completely* forgotten about the dream until last night (which is strange, because I almost never forget dreams, and I certainly wouldn't have forgotten this one). I was positive I had written it down before, about a month earlier, but there is no trace of the paper. Do you think I somehow disocciated and destroyed or hid the paper? Or is my mind just playing tricks on me? I know it's possible to have false memories... but this dream had *such* a feel of a recurring nightmare.      You should know that I have disocciated before, it only just started about two months ago and the couple times I remember it has only been a partial disocciation. I did it once right in front of my psychiatrist- he mentioned sexual abuse, and I blanked out for about one minute and couldn't remember what I had just been talking about. He told me I had disocciated, this is the first time I've been consciously aware of doing it. I have no clear memories of having completely disocciated before, but obviously I may have; this is the first major suspicion I've had, the first impression of a huge memory gap.  I used to sleepwalk as a child and if felt similar, don't know if that's relevant...       I'm sorry this is so much info, but I don't know whether I'm just going crazy... Has anything like this (being certain you did something but having no had recollection of it beforehand) happened to any of you before? Have any of you had recurring nightmares that seem similar?      Please help!!! Thank you

Is it too harsh and do you think it would be effective? Sorry if i offend you, buut hey i warned you..      ps:im not like this anymore, i wrote this last year and i'm just wondering how effective it would have been.            The fact that you’re reading this letter means that I am already dead.       So read my message to you, my message in a bottle… usually known as a long lost person sending a sacred message to someone. But I am that long lost person. Lost for many years. Longing for a way out. Then my bottle came to me, or rather your bottle. And all I had to do was take it out of the trash and set myself free.   This bottle represents so much more than just a message holder. It holds everything I hate the most. Just a few short hours ago it surrounded the very liquid that ruined my life, that now swims through your veins. The liquid that stole my mother from me. The devil in his worst form.       Take a good look at me, my cold body, the pain in my eyes. For it is the last time you will be with me, next to me, touching me. I am gone now. I feel no pain. Finally set free.       I wanted to be something, be someone. I wanted to make a difference in this world. I wanted to cure poverty, not to mention all of the other injustices that need fixing but no one will fix. It seems that everyone is so caught up in their own lives that they neglect to help those around them. Imagine what a great world we could live in.       But maybe I was never meant to be, born to die.        Right now you’re probably wondering why? Why would this girl so full of potential do this to herself? With her whole life ahead of her? Why would she give up so easily? Why? I cannot answer these questions for you, or any others you have on your mind. That is something you must do for yourself. Look deep inside yourself and see why this girl with so much potential would want to end it all. Try to understand things from my point of view. I know this idea is new to you, but just try for a few minutes. If it gets too hard, or the pain is too unbearable then you feel how I have felt for a long time. Imagine that you’re mother, the one person who’s supposed to be there for you has a terrible addiction. An addiction to a liquid so evil, so controlling, that it reduces her to nothing but a stumbling piece of embarrassment. Imagine knowing a secret, deep inside, that is the reason why your family was torn apart. Imagine being the only person who knows this secret and keeping it to yourself, even though it tears you apart, just to keep what little family you have left together. Imagine your father not loving you, leaving you without a reason, then trying to crawl his way back into your life, pretending that nothing has happened. And finally, imagine being a sixteen year old girl with all of this knowledge trapped inside your brain gnawing its way out. Pretending that all is well. Putting on a happy face day after day. Making jokes to cover up the pain, to hide your true self. Living a lie.       It’s too late now, what’s done is done. You can’t save me, but you can save your other children. Learn from your mistakes and move on. Don’t let this happen to another one of your children. They’re all you have left now. Cherish them. Give them what they need. Show them that you care for them and will do anything for them. Tell them that they mean the world to you. Tell them that you will never give up on them, even though you’ve given up on yourself.      Although you don’t know it, you’ve burnt everyone whose ever meant something to you. Your son, quiet and reserved, your daughter, ex suicidal, your ex husband, a heartless abandoner, David, confused and alone, and finally me, deceased. So finish what you started, cremate me and burn every last piece of me. Stab you’re cigarettes into me, throw me in a fire- I don’t care, just stop burning those who still have a chance. Stop hurting people who don’t deserve to be hurt. Stop hurting yourself.      I’d like to share with you my favorite piece of work. It’s a story I wrote for English. Nobody knew that the boy is me. Sitting in your very house was this paper for over a year. If you had just taken the time to read it perhaps it wouldn’t have become a reality. Perhaps the little boy would still be alive.

20090227050250AAbbUgM	Health;Dental	What other options do i have for my teeth?	Im very self concious about my teeth and smiling as on the right hand side beside my front teeth the top and bottom teeth are pushed back.   When i smile, you can see they are pushed back and in photos, sometimes it looks like they are missing :(      i enquired with my dentist and he said Veneers can not work as they are overlapping with my other teeth.      the bottom isnt a major concern but i woudl like the top to look nice.   i recently had my two wisdom teeth removed at each side of my top row and someone said that an orthodontist could move teeth over to fit the other one in.    of course this is expensive and apparently painful but was wondering if there were any other options i could put to my dentist as orthodontist is the only option he has given me :(

Last night my fiancee' was amazed at how young some of the people who she met looked for their age. They all seemed to have one thing in common: They never really overextened themselves, and had incredibly stress free lifestyles. The majority held no job or a marginal one, and still lived at home. The difference between them and "upwardly mobile" people of about the same age was too dramatic to just be co-incidence. Assuming all of your basic needs (i.e. food, shelter, healthcare) are covered, does a lifetime of low stress, menial jobs, no children ensure youth and good health?

20061203175732AAiU8gT	Health;Diet & Fitness	Weight loss?	Hi... I'm only 13, about 5'4", and... I weigh about 175 pounds, so I'm sure you can see why I'm worried. I'd love to lose weight, as it's incredibly embarassing. I'm pretty sure that it's not because I eat too much, but my lack of physical activity. So, if someone could recommend good fat-burning exercises and the amount of time I should do them for? My family owns a treadmil and exercise bike.

I eat and eat...but I'm 15 and weigh 110 or so pounds.....I mean I eat like a damned black hole. But I'm honestly nearly immune to fat it seems like. I'll admit I'm depressed and worry a lot so that does make me have a smaller diet at times...but over all I can eat 3 pizzas (along with a lot of other stuff) in less than a day. I've worked out more than one of my friends yet he still appears a bit larger...      Really it seems like working out doesn't do much either, as though I get stronger but appear the same. I never really work out much because I'm lazy and just don't see much reason to get really buff, I'm just tired of appearing so freakishly skinny. Is there anything that can at least put some fat around the forearm and such?         Also please don't say steroids =P

Mir geht es auf die Nerven, alle Welt findet sich zu dick, nur wegen ein paar Models die sich zu Tode hungern und sich dennoch wie ein Fass fühlen..ich finde das bescheuert, sicher ich habe gewisse Gene - so kann ich nicht zunehmen und deswegen finde ich das sch**** auch da ich selbst gerne zunehmen würde, und wisst ihr warum? Weil ich nicht so sein will wie jene, die so bl?d sind und sich selbst umbringen nur um 'sch?n' zu sein (wer findet lebendige skelette hübsch??), oder noch besser: eher dickere Modesch?pfer die ihre Models dazu zwingen abzunehmen, da sie sonst gefeuert werden.

I’m looking to increase my maximum Bench Press weight as well as my maximum Leg press.   This is to get into the State Highway Patrol.     I’ll need to put up one rep of each.        Will I want to do a few reps of a lot of weight or a lot of reps of a lower weight? (I’m assuming I’ll want few reps of more weight)   Should I stick to doing as many reps as I can of just the bench press and leg press?   Or are there other exercises that I should mix in that would help out in those two ‘events’?      I guess I said it best in my first question:  “what is the fastest/most effective way to increase the amount I can lift in each?”

A lot of the time, I skip lunch because I'm not very smart and I try to get all my work done (and cheat on the comps lol).      I come home at 3:30 PM, drink a protein shake with WATER and eat an apple, go downstairs, work out with weights (upper-body...I lift until I fatigue my muscles, therefore gaining muscle) and jump on the treadmill for a mile or two, depending on how pumped I am.      I come upstairs, take a shower, and eat dinner at 6 PM..maybe have some dessert and hit the sack at aroun 10 PM...       What ya think? Is this a good plan? I would only do that on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Tuesdays and Thursdays I would eat lunch and NOT WORK OUT OR DRINK A PROTEIN SHAKE...

20070111092443AAL2THw	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do talk to BF about weight?	My future husband is two hundred pounds overweight. He doesn't exercise at all. He eats high calorie, high fat, little fiber and etc foods everyday. (IE-double quaterpounder with cheese, four cheese pastas, fried chicken and etc). He never eats fish, veggies or fruits. He drinks water or juice or high caloried drinks. He doesn't eat dessert, though. He feeds his son the same way.  No fruits or veggies or fish. His son eats fast food, a lot of carbs, potato chips, and king size candy every day. I don't care if he's overweight, but I wish he would a little bit healthier to prevent health problems in the future and to be a better role model to his son. I also wish he would put his foot down to his son and feed his son a little healthier so the son won't be obese and have health problems in the future.  How do I talk to my future husband without being too mean and putting him on the defense?

20070117114148AAkWYyq	Health;Diet & Fitness	So I've got this inner thigh buldge near the top...?	Normally I'd think a girl's inner thighs should be just smooth curves, but I have this little buldge near the top of my inner thighs and I do not like it.      I'm pretty fit. I eat well and exercise, and I'm actually very slim everywhere else on my body. It's just that little area that's driving me insane. Can it be fixed naturally, or is it just the way certain people are built? Should I stop fretting? Because I really don't think it's all that attractive, to be so fit everywhere and then have this little buldge pop out of nowhere. When i tense the muscles in my thighs and pinch at it, there really isn't much fat there, just...this weird little curve outward, and then my inner thighs proceed to curve inward. It's like the only fat left on my body decided to congregate there. I'm afraid to continue losing weight just to get rid of it, though.

20090227054417AAL3jxK	Health;Mental Health	I need some SMART people, to help me out?	for some reason my mind races ALL the time even when im typing this out right which is probably gonna make me explain this not as good as i could have. but since my mind races im always thinking about stuff which gets my mind into trouble. like in social situations i would think, what if i made myself nervous and i got really pale, then everyone would stare at me like im a freak. then when i think about this stuff it actually happens!!!!!      almost like if your walking on a balance beam and if you think you will fall then it will happen. it's just bullsh*t thoughts in my head that are causing this, if i dont think about these thoughts (which are hard to do because they cause me alot of pain)   i would be completely fine if didnt think about them. so if i forgot about all this stuff i would be fine. i tryed getting drunk and it worked. but i cant be drunk all the time!!!! could i get a tranquilizer like vicodin and take them long enough for me to forget these thoughts?? because antidepressants would just have this opposite effect and screw me up even more

20090227055618AABgoVy	Health;Other - Health	PLEASE help; urgent health concern?	I'm shaking and I can't go to sleep. I threw up everything in my stomach earlier tonight, and was shaking then, too. My heart is pounding, and I feel nervous. I know I need to rest right now, as I am ill, but I don't know how. I keep clenching my teeth.   Last night, I had a very strange episode in which my breathing was extremely labored, I threw up the contents of my stomach, and I was shaking violently. Seriously, when I say that I had to breathe forcefully, I mean that my throat was tight and I wasn't breathing automatically, I think. (I had taken a prescribed dose of an irregular anti-psychotic, apparently for my "anxiety," aka body dysmorphic disorder. The dose was doubled from my previous dosage.)   My psychiatrist said this morning that I likely had a panic attack, but I've had one, and it was nothing like this. We're gonna have to call her again tomorrow and tell her that this might be a virus, because I really need to get better. This illness is horrid.   The first things my mother and I thought of were toxic shock syndrome (although my period arrived late--literally, last night--and I hadn't used tampons in between periods), ectopic pregnancy (I'm a virgin :/), and allergic reaction (this is not my first experience with the medication, so this seems absurd).   I'm really not up for another night of this. Tonight is better than last night, but it freaks me out that I'm not able to sleep.   My only other medication is Zoloft (I do no take any other drugs besides Tylenol), and I have been on a bit of a winter sickness streak this year.   I'm quite worried as to how this saga might affect my health and well-being; I have an extremely low pain threshold. :c

20090227060412AA9pim9	Health;Other - Health	Can a doctor use what I say, in confidence, against me?	I have always believed that what u tell a doctor is confidential...but now I wonder. I have epilepsy, and sometimes get really depressed. I see a nuerologist. At my appointment yesterday, I was depressed and tried talking to him about it. I told him about the fist fights Ive been getting into lately, and how I have road rage, and how I have cop friends that arent so 'honest and clean'. I wanted insight on how to calm down when i get angry. I didnt think he would say I was probably bi-polar. I dint expect him to write me a referral for a guidance counselor/pychiatrist. I realized he probably thinks Im crazy or a hazard to my family. He upped my meds by 100mg. too. When I told my mom what happened, she got really worried for me and told me I was stupid for telling him all that...(which, some of what I said was exagerated because I was playing with him)...My mom said that he call the cops/child protective services on me due to what I told him. Since I thought everything I said to him was kept confidential, I said alot of stupid things jus fooling with him...never thinking it could be a problem. (I dont beat people up!  lol)  I am scared now that what I told him can be used against me, and that I run a chance of losing my family. I wanted to call him and tell him I was lying to him, but that jus makes me sound even crazier. And, I run the chance of him not believing me anyway, maybe think Im jus back-tracking so I dont get in trouble for being 'honest', as he thinks. My mom said to leave it alone. She said I shouldnt call him and just let things lie. Im confused as to what I should do, and scared to death that what I said is going to ruin my family. If anyone can offer me advice, I would appreciate it whole-heartedly. Especially advice from any doctors online!

20090227055154AAqjVAa	Health;Diet & Fitness	What can I do to fight being put in the high risk category for insurance?	I'm 6'3" 201 lbs. with a body fat of 7.8% but regardless, my BMI calculates to 25, which states that I am over weight. At my physical for insurance they categorized me as a higher risk and I disagree. I don't smoke, rarely drink, no family history of cancer or significant hereditary illness, yet I'm going to be charged $25 more a month for insurance. I work out 5 times a week, yet someone who never works out, has no muscle mass and is made of jello, but falls below a BMI of 25 pays less then I do? It doesn't seem right. Is there anything I can do to fight it? Another insurance company is not an option, it's the only one my employer offers and they pay half my premium.

20090227053503AAUJIDN	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Birth control symptoms?	I just became sexually active a few months ago. About a month ago, I got a uninary tract infection, but was put on medication to help cure it.  During the time of taking medication for it, I started birth control, ortho tri cyclen lo.  I had my period for about 2 1/2 weeks.  Finally the other day, my period stopped.  Although that is over, I have had other symptoms that I am afraid may not be totally normal.  I get these really awful stomach aches, where it goes into my side and then progresses into my back causing great pain.  My legs and other joints are achy and sometimes feel as if they are cracking a lot.  My left boob is tender and hurts frequently.  Last night I developed flu-like symptoms, where my entire back was hurting, I had a head-ache and couldn't get warm for nearly 5 hours.  Finally I fell asleep and I woke up sweating.  My husband said I had a fever.  We went to bed and when I woke up this morning, he said I still had one and I was sweating again.  I'm feeling better now, but my husband and mother are concerned that that urinary tract infection never really went away and it's causing this.  The blood in my urine is no longer there.  I just think I have the flu since I have been working around a lot of little kids and one of my friends who worked with me yesterday got the flu this morning.  Should I be concerned?  I am usually a very healthy person.

20070717001251AAifcXJ	Health;Diet & Fitness	Slimming down is easier said than done.  Isn't there a easier and better way?	Besides expensive cosmetic surgery, I have tried everything under the sun I can think of.  From exercising, to eating healthily, to going to those beauty salons, slimming tea etc.  However I couldnt find a permanent solution.  Once I get busy and stopped exercising, the weight starts getting back.        I don't like exercise.  I have tried all kinds.  From aerobics, running on treadmills, dance classes, weight training etc.  I still don't like them.  I did it cos I thought it could be the solution to my poor social life - being fat is a disadvantage where I live.  If you have seen the movie '200 pound beauty', you'll know what I mean.      I have been thru a lot of physical and emotional pain because of my obesity.  I am not  dangerously obese but everyone is telling me to slim down.  I have given up on these known methods.  I am at the verge of accepting that I am born like this and no way I can get out of it.  Unless of course you can provide me a solution.

I've been working for the parks department this summer so am outside ALL the TIME and am pretty tan as a result.  One day, I noticed some blotchy white spots, shaped like hives, on my arms (which are the most tan part of me) and as I've gotten darker they have not.  It looks like I have some scary disease with these white blotches on my arms, and I don't know what causes it.  My dad claims he used to get  the same thing and it just has to do with pigmentation, but I get tan every summer and have never had any problem with this before.  I don't have the money or think it's serious enough to go to a dermatologist, so does anyone know what could be causing it?

20090227053129AAgcGie	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Distended stomach, GI issue..long but please read?	I am really worried about my mom.  She is only 50 and is having some kind of debilitating health crisis and is getting the run-a-round from her physician because her insurance company (United Health Care) apparently has a strict policy on allowing aggressive diagnostics.      For months, my mom has felt ill, had frequent diarrhea (often times, it comes on suddenly and unexpectedly), been doubled over in pain, and laid in bed suffering silently.  She has had no real quality of life as her symptoms have enveloped her.  In the last month her new symptom.  She wakes up feeling tired as always, but her stomach is bloated.  As the day progresses, the distention becomes more severe.  By the end of the day, it looks like she is about 9 months pregnant and is like a drum, it is very hard and sounds hollow if you tap on it. This makes the diarrhea and belching and pain worse.        She went to her family doctor a few weeks ago.  Just last week they agreed that something wasn't right and sent her for an x-ray to check for a hernia.  Based on her symptoms, the DR thought of nothing more than a hernia.  She did the barium x-ray and  expected to know something within 48 hours.  Just yesterday, the receptionist from her family doctor called her to let her know that her stomach looked fine BUT there was "something remarkable" regarding her spleen and colon.  She was told that if she is still in pain in a month they would allow her to get a CT scan.  A few red flags here....1, the DR should have been the one to give her those findings as the receptionist couldn't speculate on any of the radio report and had trouble reciting what she was reading over the phone.  2, what does "something remarkable" mean?  3, a MONTH to be in pain before they allow a CT of something they know has already been causing severe pain and sudden symptoms?  4, Why wouldn't they call the insurance to at least see if they can get a pre-auth to go ahead and get the CT scan done?  In the long run, it would be cheaper for the ins co to detect something early rather than add insult to injury and have a huge bill to pay if something goes really wrong as a result of waiting.      I do have to add, this is a doctor that no more than 6 months ago wanted to aspirate "fluid" on her knee.  After sending her for an x-ray and MRI (which was actually done pretty quickly compared to the wait they want her to endure, and it was just her knee), they diagnosed osteoarthritis and suggested a knee replacement.  Obviously, I have some concerns about this doctor and their practice.  However, I do understand why my mom doesn't want to move on just yet.  That would mean starting from square one with another.      Some history on my mom.  I don't think it's related but I'm certainly not a doctor.  '87 c-section, '89 c-section, 92' removal of gallbladder, 99' diagnosed with torticolis and receives botox in her neck to help relax the muscles every 6 months or so, '00 found out she has herniated discs in her neck which should be repaired, 01' rectocele repair .        Ever since the gallbladder removal, she has had some moderate GI issues that occur if she eats anything spicy or fried.  Also, this is about the time that her stomach appeared to be bloated and stayed that way.  She looked about 5 months pregnant and that just became the norm'.  In proportion to the rest of her body, her stomach just didn't look right but the surgeon looked around to make sure he didn't nick anything (intestines and other organs) during the cholecystectomy.  She got use to people asking if she looked pregnant but I know that secretly she tried to lose the stomach.  I have seen her purchase various diet pills and witnessed her skip meals and when she does eat she eats slowly and it is a fraction of what the rest of us eat (so I would assume she is watching her calorie intake).  Malnutrition has crossed my mind, but I do believe that she is getting an adequate supply of nourishment.      She is a CMA at a nursing home.  Her main duty is to lift people who are dead weight, some are combative.        I apologize for this being so long but I am truly worried and hate to see her go through this.  In the meantime, there is no medicine the doctor can give her to reduce the pain she is in.  Also, in the meantime, we are left to ponder what could be going on with her spleen and colon.        Anyone to shed some light on this or give us a little hope would be sent from heaven!        Thank you!!

20090227055935AADRuTU	Health;Mental Health	Problems with Anti-Depressants...PLEASE HELP ME!?	i have been taking anti depressants for about 2 weeks now...the first week everything was going fine...the second week my dr told me to move up from 25 mg zoloft to 50 mg.  I only took the whole 50 for 2 days, but ever since that day things have been getting really bad for me.  2 days ago i started having panic attacks--i have never had a problem with panic attacks before and they seem to be really bad and its really scaring me.  Since then i think i have gone through just about every different side effect possible from those meds...i have had nausea, insomnia, diarrhea, dizzyness, dry mouth, fatigue, drowsiness, shakiness, loss of appetite (i usually eat alot and i have hardly eaten anything all week--and everything i have eaten makes me feel even more nauseous), increased sweating, burning and tingling sensation, Abdominal pain, Vision changes, Hot flashes, Nervousness, Suicidal thoughts, Anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, Hallucinations, Fast heart rate, Chest palpitations.  Now majority of these all come on at once and overwhelm me.  I have stopped taking the zoloft, but i am still having sucidal thoughts...i have never even thought about things like this and its really scary.  Its almost like i am watching myself doing something and i imagine hurting myself..for example..yesterday after having a panic attack i took a bath to try to calm down, and i was too afraid to fill the bathtub up with water because i kept seeing myself drowning myself in the tub, Which freaked me out even more and just ended up making my panic attack worse.  The same thing happened when i was trying  to make dinner last night i was about to grab a knife to cut up some chicken and i started seeing myself stabbing myself over and over in the stomach.  Its really freaking me out and i dont know what to do to make these things stop, and what to do to help keep me calm when everything i look at i see a way for me to use it to kill myself.        Basically i feel like i am going completely crazy and its really scary.  i dont want to call the drs or the hospital or anything because i dont want to get checked into a mental institute or something ridiculis like that, i just want to feel like myself again      another thing that is really scary was that i was actually going to take the meds again today, its like im possessed and my mind wont let me stop these things that im going through,  LUCKILY my bf took them and is throwing them away at his work. :)

Nash, dopo trent’anni di schizofrenia, nel discorso che pronunciò ricevendo il premio Nobel in matematica per la teoria dei giochi, disse che gli intervalli di razionalità tra un episodio psicotico e l’altro non erano affatto graditi, perché “Il pensiero razionale impone un limite al concetto che una persona ha del proprio rapporto con il cosmo”.    Molti geni nelle arti e nelle scienze hanno avuto personalità schizotipiche con tratti paranoici (Edelweiss in medicina, Galois in matematica, Newton in fisica e Kant in filosofia sono solo alcuni esempi).    Quale rispetto merita oggi la follia? In che misura una certa quantità di essa è ancora indispensabile alla nostra cultura, non solo artistica, ma anche scientifica? La censura e la derisione di idee e personaggi eterodossi possono essere una follia molto pericolosa e assai poco geniale?

20090304080032AAa2nEg	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	How long does an urinary tract infection usually last?	A little over a week ago, I had classic signs of a tract infection; feeling like having to go all the time, slight blood in first couple of days of peeing, burning feeling while going.       I started drinking a ton of water to keep my system flushed and even started drinking cranberry juice.      However, it has been over a week now and all of those classic signs are gone. But in the morning my urine still smells awful and is a bit cloudy.       This is my first UTI, is this normal to last this long? (the smell)      I did go to WebMD to check out symptoms, but that site doesn't offer much help. But I am pretty confident that the infection hasn't gotten worse, because the site said if I had experienced other symptoms such as vomiting, fever, etc., that then I should see a doctor.

How long does it stay in the hole usually and should I be concern that it is there when I am breastfeeding?  I understand that it gets into the breastmilk which is why I am asking.

My boyfriend has had two partners, and i haven't had anyone before , plus he doesnt have anything on his penis, so I don't think hes got genital herpes.

Should I just give it a week and see if any symptoms occur for him?, I know technically we should go see the doctor but he lives quite far away from me. Oh and does anyone know of any tips to make coldsores go away ?

20090304091228AAc4HeA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Why do people like having hickies on their necks?	okay,  i know its harmless but its sort of a pain to actually sit there while the other person is sucking on your neck.      my older brother put up pictures of him and his girlfriend with the caption "I got a hickey:)"       ROFL!!!!!!! how is that sexy? why is that cute to some people? is it a culture thing or what? does it mean your owned by the person who gave you the hickey or something?      please explain, THANKS!
