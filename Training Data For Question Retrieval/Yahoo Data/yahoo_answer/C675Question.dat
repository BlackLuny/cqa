20070920115750AAklIx0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need to let my boyfriend know that I truly do love him?	Ok, so.... my boyfriend swears up and down that he loves me more than I love him, which I seriously think isn't true. I mean, it's possible for him to love me as much as I love him, but not more =P! But, he thinks this because I don't show affection as much as I should. So, he comes over to my house everyday....is there anything that I can do when he walks through the door that will let him know that I love him like... sooo much? And keep in mind that I DO NOT want to do anything sexual. So I don't want answers like "give him a *******" or "meet him at the door naked," I want something sweet, but I can't think of something good so I need your help. Guys and girls may answer!! =] thanks so much!

K, she broke up with me a little over a week ago, and now she is making like, a lot of time for me, and she is smiling at me, and keeps looking at me like she cares, but I dont want to go for it, because i'm afraid of ruining what progress i've came across.    also i should tell you, that we dated for over 2 years, and during that i was dealing with quick transition bipolar, and all that goes along with that, the day after she broke up with me, i got help, and i've lost almost 15 pounds from working out so good. I think she does want me back, but is still kinda, afraid or something it seems like. like now she asks me to eat lunch with her, and to walk to class with her and her friend, and she even goes to work out with me.... Does she still want me? and what do i do now? go for it, or wait till i KNOW its right?

Wheneva i go 2 meet him & he is out of the house he seems 2 take the p*** & leave me standing on the street waiting for him 2 turn up & meet me!    Within the past week he has done this 2 me twice!!   I got really upset with him & shouted... abit!   He said he was late becoz his little niece wasn't well.  Which is fair enough... but he could have rung me 2 say he was going 2 be another 30 mins l8!        But no.... he & nobody else in the house had money on their phone.      I said you could have pedald up & told me seems i was 3 mins away from ur sisters!      But no..... he didnt want 2 leave her! (but she was with her mam & gran)      He then said "I'm sorry but i care more about her, than i do you, sorry"    That really hurt, i didnt feel he needed to say that 2 me.  But on the other hand i would expect him 2 choose family over me, but it was  nasty thing 2 say.   Im wondering if i should b upset or just forget it?

Usted tiene el hábito de juntar objetos inútiles en este momento,   creyendo   que un día (no sabe cuando)   podrá precisar de ellos. Usted tiene el hábito de juntar dinero sólo   para   no gastarlo, pues piensa en el futuro podrá hacer falta.Usted tiene   hábito   de guardar ropa, zapatos, muebles, utensilios domésticos y otras cosas   del   hogar que   ya no usa hace bastante tiempo. Y dentro suyo?.   Usted tiene el hábito de guardar broncas, resentimientos, tristezas,   miedos, etc.No haga eso. Es anti-prosperidad.Es preciso crear un   espacio,   un vacío, para que las cosas nuevas lleguen a su vida. Es preciso   eliminar   lo que es inútil en usted y en su vida, para que la prosperidad venga.Es   la   fuerza de ese vacío que absorberá y atraerá todo lo que usted   desea.Mientras usted está material o emocionalmente cargando cosas   viejas e   inútiles, no habrá espacio abierto   para nuevas oportunidades.

Limpie los   cajones, los armarios, el cuarto del fondo, el garaje.Dé lo que usted no   usa más.La actitud de guardar un montón de cosas inútiles amarra su   vida.No   son los objetos guardados que estancan su vida, sino el significado de   la   actitud de guardar.

My brother is my best friend so I would love to give him a life that I could never live in this lifetime. My parents are still together after 21 years and have came from nothing to something. I would love to reward them for their hardships.       For me personally, I would love to find the love of my life. I would want to have enjoyed every aspect there is to enjoy with a relationship even the tough times and easy times.       I would love to have a child and be there in the hopsital to see it born. To take those many pictures and spam all my friends with a picture of my offspring. I might even brag how much cuter it is too.       To see the child grow up to become a handsome man or a beautiful woman, then to see the grandchildren that are born there after. Then I could spam my friends with pictures and brag how much cuter my grandchildren are. I would love to travel with all my children and/or grandchildren around the world to different countries to teach them about the various cultures and to have an open mind to life.      To die happy would be to feel complete in my life and have nothing else left to complete.

20071017170658AA3vlBQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like him alot, but does he like me?	Well there was this one time when I was studying he came over and asked what i was doing I was also very stressed for this big test, and I told him and he said don't worry about it he also came back later to ask how it was going but I had my headphones on. He also stood there forever after that.      - Before I went to the star thing I had choir practice, and before we left he came over with his friend, to ask us where it was going to be at. My friend and I didn’t know either so we called my friend who knew about it. The weird thing was was that his brother was already there, who he came with, at the star thing. When I came with my friends I saw him there and so when we came we sat down we were going to sit on the floor but we moved to the chairs he did the same and sat right behind me and there were a lot of other chairs open. During it he would make fun of the pictures and what not. At the end I chucked my scarf at him and he kept pulling on it and wouldn't let me have it back. We went outside to look at telescopes. One of the kids had problems with his so I went over the kid I like went over to look at it he couldn't see so i pulled out my cell phone for the light and I saw him smiling. When we went over to look at the big telescope he and his little brother were running around me I guess playing not sure, but the kid next to me “guys stop being flirts” so yeah…      - On New Years eve I went to a Black tie party, I went out side after dancing and when I tried to get back in it was locked I then called my best friend to chat and to keep my mind off of being out in the dark (I hate the dark) so I called and asked if she could help me to call my friends or something. And well he was at her house. I asked if should could like come over and rescue me and what not and then he got on the phone and said he would come and save me. This was a minor story, but I felt like sharing. ^.^         - Ok so during school I had to do a play, it was really for the older class but they needed more people so I had to even though I didn’t want to. After my part was done I didn’t have to go back up. (Thank god!!) He was talking to much with his friend so he got moved. I thought he was farther from my chair, but he was right in front of it. So during the play he would keep turning around to comment on the play. I had a meeting with my teacher to sing some song for something, after that I when back to get my jacket and he came by to ask me what he said who knows why because he came in not to long into the convo. So that was one of the moments.      - While at my graduation he gave a speech and while he was up there I could feel someone stare at me and when I looked at him he was staring at me even almost during the entire time he spoke to. That was a little on, but hey I told you anyway

20071013003612AAiPezo	Family & Relationships;Family	Why am i always so angry?	I don't understand why i'm angry almost all the time.  I have come to realize i hate my dad and my brother and sometimes i just want to get away from my friends.  I don't have a bad lifestyle. I usually get what I want.  School stresses me out, but not to an extreme so I don't think that's what's causing my problem.  I really have pretty much no reason to hate my dad. He just annoys me way too much and sometimes i just want to tell him to shut up.  i know he's trying to communicate with me because i don't talk to him.  It's the little annoying habits that he has that just pisses me off. Even now I'm getting angry at him and he's not even here.  What also pisses me off about him is when he's angry he yells at me for the littlest things, and sometimes i feel like he tries to pick a fight with me.  I hate my brother because he stands up for my dad and acts like him.  I pretty much give attitude to everyone and i just want my dad and brother to stop saying i'm a *****. what should i do?

Me and this girl were together for almost a year and everything was great and i never saw us breaking up and she said the same, but about 2 months ago we broke up n it was mostly her that wanted it but she never had a reason why other than she quit liking me. And we've been talking and fighting ever since the break up and last week we said that we dont want to see eachother and dont want to talk 2 eachother ever again but i know neither of us really meant it...i think we were really saying we just want some time and space. I could get over her easily because there are many other gurls that are always trying to get with me since i'm single now but i dnt want 2 get over her if there's anything left between us. She says she likes this other guy now but i've seen them together and its nothing special so i think she's just tryin to get to me. Idk what i should do and the only advice i've got is wait a while and quit thinking about her and see what happens, but what i do if nothing happens??

20071217155119AAtVSjF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I fell in love with him, now what do I do?	For about a year now, I've been talking to this guy. A few months after we first met, we hooked up. Ever since then I haven't been able to get over him. I am completely head over heels for him. We can talk for hours on end and not get bored of each other nor is there ever an awkward moment for us. Last summer I would stay up until three in the morning talking with him. Over this past year, I've fallen in love with him. It's silly to say that, because we only hooked up once, but my feelings for him are incredible and I don't have them for any other guy, nor would I want to. I know that he doesn't feel the same way about me that I feel about him...at all. I need some help here. How can I make him return those feelings for me and make him want to be with me, without telling him how I feel....oh and without being slutty. Haha. All of your help is appreciated :)

20071020220944AAsUCkN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	this guy first told me about a whole bunch of restaurants that are good and then said in case i ever wanted to go to one. then he didn't talk to me for a couple of weeks. then he asked if i wanted to work on an assignment for a class together, so we did and he asked where i sat in class and then the next class he sat beside me. then he asked me if i ever wanted to play racquetball with him, but then i saw that on facebook he's in a racquetball club and he wrote "i'll play with anyone, just message me". so i'm not sure if he likes me or is just trying to make friends with anyone and everyone. oh, and we're both in our 3rd year of uni so we're 20 years old. oh, i may be reading too much into this, but when we were in the lounge together, there was no room on the couch i was sitting on so he sat on a diff couch, but then when the pple on my couch left he got up and looked out the window and then sat on my couch way on the other side, but then he leaned over on his elbow towards me.

20071108145517AAKp86U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get someone to notice you in an attractive way?	Ok, here's my situation, I'm really interested in my TA (he's as old as I am of course). I'm not sure if I stand out to him in a positive way or even know if he's interested in me back. I'm the girl who asks questions even though I doing pretty good in the class. I even corrected him once (eek!). Pretty much, I'm one of the two interactive people in the discussion. I've even asked him questions at the side, but all completely sincere. Haven't talked to him personally, so i don't really know him besides him being my TA. i've noticed him sitting closer to where im sitting in lecture and somehow have seen him glance at me at the corner of my eye. Plus, he gets nervous everytime he lectures and he's all smiles. Could he be interested???
20071109163803AAYLD3p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	ok so there is this guy and ive known him for 2 yrs. ive talked to him many times; just not much anymore. he says hi to me sometimes. he asked me to make out with him a few months ago. it didnt really happen, all he did was kiss me and he was playing with my hair. and hes asked me to hang out with him after that but i didnt go.  he said hi to me in the summer alot and always stared at me. [hes my neighbor]. but anyway in school he always looks at me alot and stares and then when i see him looking, he'll look at me a little longer or just look away. he always looks at me on the bus too with like a gazed look in his eyes, but he never says anything to me. does this mean he likes me or not?

20080326083610AAaturP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bi-curious girlfriend?	I've been going out with a girl for around a month now. And I've a strong feeling that she's bisexual. She invited her friend into bed one time about two weeks ago in the morning when her friend came into the room after we'd slept together. And there we all were lying naked, we weren't doing anything, and I didn't mind so much, but she kept suggesting that we do something. Also she's kissed girls before, and has been in a 'threesome, with no sex'. And when a girl was getting touchy feely and grabby with her she didn't do much to give her the message to back off. I'm not sure if she's just too weak to let people know thier bounderies, she's got quite a submissive personality, or does it sound like she's just bi, or maybe even lesbian?      I appreciate any input people can give me. Cheers.

20080202132531AAPeDaw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For the ladies 22-35 who prefer to get to know a guy before having sex to soon.?	So, there's something us guys face when it comes to first, second and third dates.  And that is either making a move on a girl too fast or becoming the "friend' by moving too slow.  I can't say I've become the friend before because my outcomes have been moving too fast or it's been acceptable to the girl.  I don't know how else to say this, but I just have simply not given her the chance to think "he doesn't want to make a move on me" which sometimes has worked against me.  So, I would like to make my moves in the future a bit slower.  I wanted to see what is acceptable to you and I will tell you what is in my head as what is the correct way to do things.        Hand holding and kissing by the second date.      inviting her over for dinner by the 4th date.        We can say each situation is different, but I think hand holding and kissing by the 5th date and inviting her over for dinner on the 10th is a bit slow.  So, I'm looking to know what is not too fast and not too slow to you...

20080330152052AAwTtnj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Met a girl online?	I met her online. Gone out with her twice, and she came over to my house once. We have a great time together and every time we agree to get together again. She is busy though (classes (master's degree)) on weekends and work during the weekdays). We usually talk on IM, since she's busy most of the time and can't always talk on the phone. I am pretty sure I know the answer to this question, which makes me wonder why I am asking it. I really like her, we have a lot in common (more than can be imagined), just wondering if working around her schedule is worth it.
20080329202910AAyENix	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he talk badly about his gf in front of me?	I have a guy friend who has an out of town gf. He doesn't talk about her much but when he does he doesn't say nice things about her. He'll say things like if they lived in the same town she wouldn't be his gf. He has flat out said she's not the one and he wouldn't even think of ever marrying her. He said an out of town gf is the way to go---low maintenance.       My question is does he say these kind of things to give me the impression things aren't serious between them because he might like me (and he doesn't realize it makes him sound like a jerk)? Or is he right---guys feel like they have to have a gf and an out of town gf is the way to go? Or does he hate to even acknowledge he has romantic feelings towards anyone so he talks about her like this?

20080401144848AAjUvMw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the guys?	If you were out with your buddies at the local bar, and heard a rather intoxicated girl talk about her problems, including her extensive sex life, what would be your first impression? Whats your opinion on girls who use allot of profanity? Would you prefer an out-spoken girl who doesnt care what anyone hears, or a quieter girl who doesnt get loud about her life in public?    Now take it to a club..when you see a girl in a very revealing outfit, what do you think of her? Would you go for the girl who reveals everything, or the girl who reveals a little less? This is based on your personal opinion, no explaination needed. This is allot of questions, I know..so thanks for taking the time!!

There's a guy at work who has made it obvious that he is attracted to me but he is very careful not to show anything when certain colleagues are around.  I understand why he might do this but it leaves me rather confused.  When certain people are not around this rather shy guy changes from being cold towards me to being very sweet, cute and considerate while he gets over-enthusiastic talking to me and agrees with anything I say.  What do you think?

20080924140550AAbnjjc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Taboo love with my mother step brother, what can I do to make people understand?	When I was 18 I became romantically involved with my mothers step brother who was 33 at the time. Although we are not blood related the relationship was obviously considered a big taboo and the age gap didn't help so we kept it secret for almost a year before we were found out. My mother was devastated by our affair and as much as I loved my boyfriend I couldn't bare to hurt my mother any further and broke off the relationship. It was hard though and we always ended up back together as we couldn't stay apart for long. Eventually at my request he took a job in the States and was there for over 10 years in which I never saw him at all. During that time we have both had other relationships but nothing that ever matched what we felt for each other and we were always in each others thoughts.   He is now back in the UK and wants us to finally be together. The first time I saw him after all those years all the old feelings came back instantly and I believe I love him more than ever and can't forgive myself for all the years I wasted by not being with him. I am now 31 and he is 46 and still gorgeous.    We are at the point now where we want to marry and start a family we are soul mates and do not wish to waste another minute living a lie but why must our happiness cost others so much pain?   Part of me just wants to up and run away with him so we can be together in peace but I don't see why we should be ashamed of our love?      How can I best deal with this tricky situation?

20081001204920AAcH3iO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you forgive your ex if he did this to you? ?	I want to forgive my ex so bad and just move on with my life. I have forgiven my other exes, and I never think about them. But this one- he was my boyfriend this year. He seemed to be the perfect guy, but then he broke up with me, left me in this really trashy motel where I had no car and no one else to turn to... I ended up staying with a stranger I just met and didn't know before I finally flew back home. Every time I move on with my life, out of the blue, he finds a way to contact me, every time I am dating a new guy, he contacts me and says he is sorry for everything he has done and claims that he wants to understand me and support me (whatever that means, I don't know). He has done this so many times, and has even accused me of giving him an STD he never had and never had any symptoms of (and I don't have symptoms of it, either! And have never given anyone an STD!), every time he seems like he has changed, he has NOT! I have even tried to lose contact with him but it's like he is still there! It is hard to lose complete contact with him since we have known each other since BIRTH (but not closely until recently) and we have MANY mutual friends... is it sane for me to forgive him or not?!

20080928015837AA0je5W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a guy doesn't call often does that mean he doesn't give a friggin crap about you?	I've know this guy for about a year. He was very interested in me, pursued me and eventually we met up and went on some dates. But progressively he started calling less often. This started kinda early on, he would call every few days or weeks and one time about a month long. Then he'd make contact and it'd be all good to him. And one time he guilt tripped me and said he was constantly chasing me and he wanted me to chase him. Well then, I called him more often, but still, no difference in his behavior. We have gone a bit far in terms of experimenting with each other, but no sex. He says he like me a lot, actually, he said he loved me numerous times but I kinda didn't return that I love you statement because I'm still trying to figure out if he's a player or not. Every time he said this, he would wait a moment for me to return the comment, and when I didn't, he'd say, it's okay, you don't have to love me. Anyway, he's also expressed the desire to have babies with me, he says he thinks like this when he gets excited about someone. He said he would marry me, but never asked me to be his girl, he has said he didn't like labels (is this important?). He also sent me a pic of half his bod, he's hot. Then I sent him a pic of my boobies, no the face though. He got all hot and bothered. But anyway, I'm revealing too much. My deal is, why doesn't this guy call often. After that pic exchange, he called a bit more, and some days after, but now, it's been like four days (not a lot for him, but still). I don't know what it is, explain. Does he care or not? Is he a player, and why does he say these things. He doesn't pressure me for sex, even though I know he wants it and talks about it and we've had phone sex a few times and he was really hot. But like, what's the deal here?

While my older brother gets all the pampering, and when i just make a little mistake like yesterday he got a large burrito for us and i took like 3 bits and then he said take another. so i did and i was just joking around and bit it like a T-rex and some tortilla fell off and beef and rice and stuff came falling off. so he got all pissed off. and i got all depresed all day that day. and my birthday was on the 4th of July and he still hasnt given me what i wanted which was just $300 to buy a Wii, which i have heard about ever since they've called it a Nintendo Revolution. and he knows that i really admire it. but i just think that he hates me.

My bestfriend and I had a huge fight on monday and its been going on for like 2 weeks, We are very close friends and have been for awhile.

20080608142956AAGuEzE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question Of The Night?	I once knew a beautiful lady about eight years ago.  She was cheeky, mischevious, fun, loving, caring and knew to be my soulmate. We had a rocky ride being together, apart, together, apart.  Until one day when I decided to suprise her by cleaning up my act.  I ended up having a nervous breakdown and was institutionalised as a result.  I lost contact with everyong I knew as in excommunication to keep myself from going further downhill.  I was not in a fit state to do anything.  With recovery from this I feared I had maddened her and her parents in the way it happened.  I spent every day for the next five or six years hoping I would meet her again or she would contact me. Then the other week she did and we met.  My feelings for her were still there and it was as if we had never been apart, although I was a better person.  She (I found out) is now married and is in turmoil as has just had her 6 year old question of "what the F**K happened" answered.  What should I do next?

20081007012244AAM3jQM	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Elopement or Wedding?	Hi everyone - I'm really struggling to decide between a wedding or just eloping somewhere romantic.      Usually it would be an easy decision, I would elope because a wedding is so expensive and I hate speeches and ceremony etc...(also my fiance is keen on eloping).      I just know I'm going to disappoint my whole family if I don't have a wedding, and everyone says I'll regret it later if I don't have a wedding now.      What is your experience - do you think elopement or wedding, and has anyone eloped and regretted it later?
20080928214303AAzUBg1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What am I feeling and how do I get over it?	I realize it's slightly pathetic, but I don't know why it is happening. I was in a relationship (if you can call it that) six months ago (to the day) that lasted three days. Since then, I've been close to going out with a few different people, and dated one for like, two and a half weeks. I currently have a date to homecoming that wants to become more than just that. But I am not so sure. The one girl from six months ago (my first relationship) is still in my head. It hurts to think about her. I'm perfectly fine and composed when I'm in a class or like, a football game, or something near her. But if I start to think about her, like if I''m falling asleep, it feels like there is a hole tearing at my heart and I can't fall asleep. Literally, I can feel it in my chest. I can't help from crying, even though I know I would be a lot better off than if I was with her. When I told her I had started dating the one girl over the summer, she told me she was scared she had hurt me, and was glad I got over her. But I don't think I ever did. I really don't want to tell her how I feel though. I know she would feel guilty about it. And I really want her to be happy, regardless of how terrible it makes me feel. She is the only person outside of my family I would give my heart, my soul, my life, everything for; and I just want to get past it all. But I don't know how. Please explain or help!

20081004142105AAQcNhC	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help...school drama?	You see...at my school there is always something going on. Well there's these girls that r popular.Every year they adopt someone into their group. This year it is a friend of my friend.(my friend will be known as A and her friend as F). In this group I like one of them and she willbe known as N. Well F found out about my crush and told N. N took it fine and wants to be friends. Next day F and N's friend T told me that N doesnt like me and I should just stop wasting my time. That is one of the problems....F changed and not in a good way. Even though those group of girls r actually nice F is an ****** now. Next problem...to make way for F they kicked out C(one of their friends) for saying N's outfit was ugly. So now everyone hates C and C is hanging out with my friend A who is nice. T and another guy (we'll call him B) are spreading nasty rumors. T and B r guys and they gossip....I find that kinda gay. B went up to C and said "WHY R U HANGING OUT WITH A AND HER FRIENDS! THEY JUST WANT TO BE POPULAR!" That offended A and all of her friends. Should I confront F and say she's gotta stop with these rumors because they r making things uncomfortable for N and me. And should C apologize and join the group again? U tell me...

I'm 16, the farthest iv'e gone with a guy is just kissing, only one guy too. So you can't consider me a ****, even though i feel like one right now. I know im a good girl and all but i want to do something completely out of my character. I dont want to have sex because condoms arent enough protection in my opinion and besides i dont think im ready for that yet anyways. Iv'e been best friends with a guy for about three years now we have only been friends, we never dated or anything. im not ready to get into a relationship again with anyone but i think i love my friend in general. Im not exactly sure if im in love with him if not then close maybe. idk i want to do things with him, i want him to hold me, kiss me touch me and yea. but no sex. idk what to do, what should i say or should i forget this. trust me im not stupid i think you should be emotionally mature enough to handle this and i think i am. idk im confused. i need advice, what do you think? please no insults, i just want advice from people who have more experience like a big sister advice not mom type. thank you.
20081009133035AAtLImx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I present grooming issues to my girlfriend?	I have recently started a new relationship and I really enjoy being with her. We have a lot of chemistry, a good sex life, and communicate with each other very well.      I have one concern and it stems from her personal grooming habits of body and pubic hair. She has some body hair that I would prefer be removed; and as far as pubic hair, she has not had much experience in the bedroom and does not groom in the area; I am not asking for total clean shaved, but trimmed would be a nice improvement. I am also more than willing to trim myself in that region as well.      If it were any other aspect of our relationship, I would feel comfortable bringing it up nicely/directly. However she already has an issue with being self conscience about her body.      Is this something I am going to have to live with, or is there a tactful way I might approach the subject that would not hurt her feelings?

20081011213813AA6F08r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If single, Is it wrong to get(pay) a stripper for private dance at home and Lap dance?	Ok i'm 28. male. dont have a girlfriend, never had one.    I'm a good person. I dont do it often , i called the escort(not the ones that have sx)/stripper service like 7 times  4 years ago  but that's it. I'm semi-impotent too so besides just feeling sexual and wanting it,  I have done it for that reason too, to check if my thing works.       Anyways, i feel that women would think it's stupid, sick and whatever if  a guy gets strippers and has lapdances but i'm not a bad person, i'm just a shy guy and i just wanted to try it out and also do a check for my body.       Is it wrong? It's not like i had sex .       So if i ever had a girlfriend in the future, is it reasonable to hate me just cause i did that?

Ok, since I don't want to mention my friends name over the internet, lets jjust call her: Jeana      Ok so "Jeana" was the 1st friend I ever had. I met her when I was 4 and I adored her. She was my idol. I wanted to be just like her and everything. From the time I was 4 til the time I was about 10, I loved Jeana. I always wanted her to be my big sister because I thought she was cooler than me, Prettier than me...etc. But latley everything has changed. From the time I turned 11, she chnaged. She got moody, rude, and acted like she was too cool for me. So everytime she was rude, I would ask her what is wrong. She would never tell me. Then when I turned 12 (now) I feel like she is jealous of me or something. She thinks I lie to her, about having my period, bra size, all that stupid stuff that she shouldn't worry about. She even lies about her bra size and she is jealous because I am 1 size bigger (big whoop). I just don't understand her! Please help! (There lots I could say but no more room

20061216213904AApXWoO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is the appeal of the gentlemen a thing of the past?	Is chivalry dead? Is being courteous even necessary anymore on the behalf of the man during the relationship?      It seems that having a grasp on the attribute of cunningness outweighs the ability to sweep a woman off her feet with sheer wit and personality, with a touch of please and thank you.      Women ask for a man to fall in love with their personality and the person they truely are, yet women find themselves in relationships with men who take advantage of them . Hence why their complaints aspire that men are lying pigs.      So my point?      Its proven, that if I dress, act, and sound like an asshole who's confident(cocky), and doesn't take any ****, I'll have better chances with decent women.      versus,      Listening to a woman, learning about her wants, needs and being there for her every day/night/minute/second, where as im shut out from most women of quality. Because im friend material.      Why? Good guys have feelings to, we just choose to respect others feelings as well.

I'm the smartest kid in school, yet she keeps telling me to study for the SAT and ACT, because I'm a junior. But these tests are 5 months from now. And I already studied like crazy for the PSAT, the SAT doesnt need 5 months of prepping.      she doesn't let me go hang out with friends at their house, or go to the movies with them sometimes. And she hates when I talk on AIM, saying its a waste of time, and other BS. It's stupid, I do a sport every season, and yet i maintain a 99 average.      All that I guess I can take, but I'm worried what will she do if I get a girlfriend sometime soon...      What should I do?? thanks..
20061208165902AAhJTmU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with a guy?	There is this really funny and cute guy i like. I think he likes me too because whenever we see each other we are constantly flirting and we just have a good time. Well like 2 weeks ago he told me that he liked one of my good friends and said he was thinking about asking her on a date. I don't know if he knows i like him, but since he is trying to see if i'll help him get a date i don't think he knows. So, i told him that i *thought* she really liked him and i'm sure she would go on a date with him. Well, i asked my girlfriend and she said she doesn't really like him like that. I just don't know what to do! Do i make a move on this guy and let him know i like him, or just wait it out and see what happens? Give me your opinions! Thanks in advance.

20090308001811AAhTapl	Family & Relationships;Weddings	We can't afford to be in the wedding party and go to the wedding... What do we do?	My husband is best man and I am a bridesmaid. A year ago when they asked us to be in the wedding, the circumstances were totally different than they are now. Total wedding accommodations and wedding party expenses are around $2200.       The wedding is now a month away and we just got slammed with an extremely large medical bill. We're already in a crap load of debt (students loans just hit repayment). Basically, we have to do what is best for our finances right now. How do I tell her?       She has a very strong personality and I know this will be the end of our friendship. She cut another bridesmaid out of her life months ago when she said she couldn't afford it. We don't want to lose the friendship, but we're already drowning in bills. I've lost 20 lbs in the past month because of this stress. Any idea what to say or how to salvage the friendship??

20081115203418AAXidIk	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Boyfriend who says he's ready for marriage, but won't propose?	I am female graduate student who is 25 years old.  I will receive a doctorate degree in May of 2009, at which point I plan to move to a different city than the one I am currently in and start my career.      I started dating my current boyfriend about three years ago when I first began my graduate program.  Shortly after things became serious, I brought up the subject of marriage, not necessarily with HIM, just in general.  I made it clear that while I was in no hurry to get married right away, I wasn't the type of woman who would wait around forever for a guy to propose.  The man either wants to marry me or not.  If a guy was 100% certain he had met the woman of his dreams, he would have no qualms about marrying her.      But the problem is... he doesn't ever say things like, "I'm just not ready," "I need more time," or "I'm not sure."  To the contrary, he says he wants to marry me and spend the rest of his life with me.  He began saying such about 9 months into our relationship.  Yet, three years into it... no proposal.      Every year, he asks me to move in with him.  Every year I politely decline.  Co-habitation before marriage just isn't my thing, (it's fine for others, I don't judge--- just not for me).       Every time I bring up the subject, he says he wants to marry me.  I ask, "When?"  He says he can't tell me because he wants it to be a surprise.  He's been telling me this for years.      This experience has made me reconsider this whole relationship, mainly because I feel it's pointless to stay with someone when it's so abundantly clear the feelings aren't reciprocated.  I'm starting to see less and less of him.  I'm making myself more and more busy.      I think if he hasn't proposed by graduation time, I'm going to leave him, and, with my re-location to a different city and a new career starting, just start fresh.  Of course, this thought is devastating, as I love him dearly.  But I love myself more.  Why wait around for a commitment that may never come?      Am I being unreasonable?
20090308001458AAAt3lR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Blaming husband and his family for past mistakes-part 2?	This is continued from my previous question. I have tried so many things to make her happy. I hate shopping, but for my wish, I pushed myself for shopping. I have learnt so many things from her. Now she is living separately and even she didn't let me know where she is living. Whenever I bring to work on our marriage, or if I say about our loving days she will try to escape from that or she will disconnect the call. I am tired of talking to her, but still I love her. Whatever I will tell, she will give one or other reason why she doesn't want to work on our marriage. She is saying if my mind will change she will come back otherwise she will not come. Even she took some of my jewellers with her. She took my car also saying that she will sell that car and will give part of money from that. Since I registered car in her name I accepted that. But she didn't give back anything. So last I said if you think you will get happiness without me, you can take any decision. Tell me now what I can do? My parents are angry upon her because when they didn't interfere in our marital life, my wife bought them into the picture and scolded them. now what I have to do?

20090308014558AAa1fNm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would you leave him?? Trust problems. Advice Please!!!?	When I got into this relationship, I gave my boyfriend pretty much all my trust. I started to slowing not trust him, because he said when he got with me he wanted nothing to do with his ex (he cheated on her with me), and they stayed in contact. She was calling my phone to talk to him, saying he gave her my number, and he denied it. I dont know how else she would have gotten my number, and he wouldnt tell her to stop calling, but finally I had to get my number changed. He would stay out a lot or be busy working, but just the things he'd say would make me wonder if something was going on. (He said there was cameras in the house, and that I always act paranoid, and that he sees and hears everything.) One night when I was sleeping my friend from out of state texted me saying "hey babe". My boyfriend wrote back acting like he was me. When I asked him why, he said he didnt like how the guy talked to me. He gave me his passwords and I had a feeling about something so I decided to go on his Myspace one night, and he was talking to his ex's sister, she wrote him first asking him if he would have gotten with her if he was never with her sister, and that she has been sexual dreams about him, and wants him to come visit. When he first wrote back, he said it didnt matter because it was 2 years ago, and that she was married and had a baby now. But then he wrote back saying yes he would have gotten with her if he was never with her sister, and he was afraid to visit because he was scared he would want her all to himself. They were talking a lot, and sending xoxo's and I love you, but he said it was a "I love you" as in a family thing. He wrote to girls telling them how good they look, and wanting to get together to drink. My name is never mentioned in the emails but he says he has my pictures on his Myspace so I'm just being insecure. I am pregnant and want the best for my son and I. I have been hurt a lot in the past, and going through this with him, I have lost a lot of trust in him. Lately I have been accusive, or bitchy, because I'm afraid of being hurt again. He says the reason he said things about the cameras was just to say it joking around, and that he wrote to the girls because they have low self-esteem and that I'm just insecure. The reason I keep going off on him is because for one, I'm pregnant and feel like he has no time to talk or see me because he's always busy or working. And for 2, back around new years, he got kicked out of where he was staying and moved with his ex for a week. I heard about it and asked him, but he denied it saying he don't talk to her no more. But he finally admitted to living there after he was accused of rape and stealing and got kicked out. He said he stayed there for a week because he got kicked out of the other place and didnt tell me because he knew I would worry about something going on over there but he had nowhere else to go. So knowing he lied to me about living there then telling me after he was accused, makes me think was he telling the truth about not doing it or was that just another lie? The girl wouldnt talk to me, but the ex told me that she went to the hospital and got a rape test done and it said she was raped and that they found DNA but had only 48 hours to find him to see if it was his. I dont know if thats true because I thought they would know it was him if they found it. And they could of went to his house because they knew where he was living. I'm thinking maybe he felt guilty about lying about living there, and admitted to it because they were lying about the rape? And I checked and there was no report made on it either. Anyway, would you leave him, knowing that he has lied in the past, and knowing that your pregnant struggling, and hardly get to see or talk to him? If not, how would you work it out with him, and rebuild your trust to have a happy family?

20081118160709AAPoGCq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, is it ok to email her?	So I wanted to email an old girlfriend to see how she is doing.  We had been dating for quite some time (a couple years) but I ended up breaking it off as I was in Europe and she was in the States, I wasn't ready to get married, and I just didn't want to string her along.  We've exchanged emails sporadically (very sporadically) over the past couple years.  I just wanted to send her a note to see what she was up to and what she was doing...just see how life's treating her.      Is this wrong? I definitely broke her heart breaking up with her, so I'm not sure if it's ok to try to say "hello".  Still, I do care about her and would like to know how she's doing.  Advice?

I would be happy that M made a new bff. well, at least somewhat happy. but not only is she ditching us for her, but she completey ignores me and my friends and is acting stuck up. i feel really crappy because M and I were like sisters and had so much fun together. But everything suddenly changed. ugh, how to deal?
20090308001300AAkwN5y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is She Interested in Me?? Please Help!!?	I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question. Obviously, to me, this question is very important, and I would like your opinion. (Note; I'm a college student)      So I met this girl at school in the cafeteria. I have a bad/good habit of walking up to people and starting random conversations. This conversation I started was somewhat relevant because I mentioned event that was happening on campus and was wondering if she would go. And from there, I was able to get her name and just kind of become her acquaintence. I haven't really seen her that much during that semester, but did say hi occasionally.      This semester I joined one of the club's she is president of. I got to get to know her from one of the meetings where I spent about 2 hours making/decorating a building for the club. It was fun. I was with her and her friend, and we had some fun talk. I mentioned something about the music I listen to and how she should check it out. She subsequently sent me a message via facebook asking for some of the music, which i gave her.      Next time I saw her was at the next meeting, she thanked me for the music I gave her. I showed her another song, and she said she really liked it. When I was leaving, she asked where I was headed because she would offer me a ride back to my dorm. I declined though because I was going in the opposite direction. She also said "Thank you so much for coming today!"      I e-mailed her later that day about a charity event idea that she came up with and gave her constructive ideas about it. I recieved an e-mail back saying basically thanks for the ideas and another thanks about the music I gave her and how she really liked it.      I saw her again at the cafeteria the next day and I waved hi to her when I saw her and she was about to pay for her food but she came over to me to talk instead. She asked how I was, what I'm going to do, and how she liked the music, yet again. I said I would give her some more music and she said that sounded great and she suggested we get lunch sometime. I agreed and she asked for my number. She was giving me that nice soft smile.      So I saw her a few days later and there was an event going on that was co-hosted by the club and she suggested I go. I said maybe, but ended up going anyway. I got there and sat down and watched the movie, avoiding contact with her at all, and at the end of the movie, went down to sign the petition which was in front of the room and as I was signing, she came next to me and started talking to me. The usual questions (What's up, Where you going after, etc) and then we talked abit about how our week is almost over and spring break is around the corner. She said she was disappointed that we couldnt hangout before break and that she was going back to her home for break and I found out she lived in the same state as me, so I suggested we get together over break. She thought it was a good idea and agreed. I also mentioned something about my exam I had in two days also.      I txt'd her the next day telling her that if i dont see her before she leaves, i hope she has a safe trip back and ill call her to hangout over break. She replied like 7 hrs later and said Thanks for coming [to the movie] last night! And that she thinks it would be fun if we could get together over break. And to ''stay in touch and goodluck on my midterm tomorrow''.      This week, I've seen her alot (practically everyday) in random times and places. Like today, I was walking to the gym and happened to see her on the way there. I was looking at her to see if it was indeed her and then looked away and looked back again and saw she was looking at me.      This may also seem farfetched, but I also noticed that the club membership list (which she typed up) had my name on it right next to hers (note: there are 60+ names on that list).      Do you think she is just extremely nice or interested? She also is holding hands in her fb pic, but she never mentioned it at all to me. From the signs above, what do you think?   EDIT: I just found out she has a boyfriend...but read this and you'll see why I'm confused...

But then again i am paranoid with these things. We will be going out five months next week. The other day he asked me if I wanted to go with him and his friends to go bowling. I told him no because I would have to leave right when I got there because I had other plans, which he knew about. I also told him I did not think that his friends liked me. Later that day I called him and asked him if he wanted to go to the movies with me and my friends he said no because of the movie choice. Yes I was disappointed but it was not a huge huge deal. Later he confronted me. He has not really called me or texted or anything like that. Until two days later and he is still upset. Is there a chance he is going to break up with me? Or am I just paranoid? Should I give him his space?
20090308000627AAc2jOq	Family & Relationships;Family	Elderly care and relatives?	Elderly care and relatives?   My mother married a year ago and moved 4 hours away. Before she married she was caring for her mother who is now 92. After mom moved away she depended on me to watch out for grandma. I am very close to grandma and didn't have a issue with this until I felt I was being taken for granted and everything I did had some fault to it. Grandma had a live in care provider for many years which required follow up visits and transportation when needed. I was the one who did all these things since my mother moved away with her husband. My mom has given my cousin second power of attorney if somethings happens to my mom who is Primary power of attorney. My cousin has no involvement with my grandma except on holidays. Recently grandma now has been moved into a nursing home that is a hour away from me. My mom expects me to obtain follow up visits weekly or more while keeping my own Personal life together. How I can I tell my mom I am there for all of them but cant continue with the expectations that this is my responsibility. My mother is also retired and has plenty of time on her hands

Personally, I dont even care that much when she beats me at anything, but whenever I beat her she always has an excuse.       Should I talk to her about it, or just leave it and ignore it?

20081030182544AAMIkeP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has your EX ever come back/contacted you after Months?	5 months ago, my Girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me. This hurt alot. She is 20, i am 25..We were head over heels in love with each other and on top of being lovers, we were each others best friends. Everything we did was an amazing experience and she told me how she wanted to marry me and have kids, etc. Never in my life have I met such a beautiful girl who we shared so much in commom and had so much love. Anyways, she broke up with me but starting becoming distant a few months prior. She told me she didnt feel the love for me and didnt want to be together. I know she never ever cheated on me. She said she didnt feel the same spark. Over these last few months I have struggled with trying to keep her in my life or just leeting her be all together. We have had very little contact since the breakup which was tough because we talked all the time. I finally reached to her one last time and dropped of a picture frame with rose petals inside and a picture of me kissing her during happy times. she called me the next day and said how mice it was but wanted me to move on since what we had was in the past. she called me 2 weeks ago to wish me a happy bday. I always throught she woul reach out to me but she hasnt...I guess my question is, after loving me sooo much and relying on me to be her rock and even with ME reaching to her, why hasnt she contacted me at all to at least catch up...what is your experience with an ex you loved? anybody have them contact you after months and months:?

20081115175655AA73oR8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I need help on planning my wedding?	I am planning my wedding. We are going to do it outside. We are only inviting about 40 people and most of them are family only 2 or 3 friends.      I am planning on baby blue for the color accent. The place we are planning it at is called bridle creek its in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It has a great view and has a little cabin type thing to do the reception. We are planning on doing food and I am calling around now to figure out what is the cheapest. We dont have much money so we need to do everything very cheap. I dont want a lot of decorations. I plan to find my dress on sale or clearance. As you can tell I am not that picky. Also I am planning to hand make the invitations and reply cards.      I am needing to know what EXACTLY is required. Obviously we will need rings. From there I am not quite sure what is absolutely necessary. I think I need flowers and the brides maid will need flowers. We will need a cake. So if you can think of any thing else that would be wonderful......      Please let me know if you have any suggestions on doing this cheaply and where to find things and so forth. Also what do u think is necessary to have a wedding?      Keep in mind I have about 6 months before the wedding so I have time to shop around. If you know of a good time to find certain things please let me know!!!!

20090308001637AAJGwAc	Family & Relationships;Friends	Flatmate from hell...?	When I moved in my flatmate had a parade of males leaving our place for months. It all settled down and then we started socialising together and having a few drinks out as friends.    Now each time we'd go out we'd meet people and end up having an after party back at our place. I was unaware that she was only bringing people back to ... you know... Anyways, the last 3 that she brought back were interested in me instead and although they were shut down pretty quickly it was enough to do her ego damage.   Now she's said that I'm the one bringing randoms home, and am providing an unsafe environment- even though it's MY son that lives there with me!   Essentially I've been evicted- over the phone- but she still wants to make it clear that it's her problem not mine...   Should I just leave without a fight and be the bigger person? Try to work it out? Tell her what I really think? or explain to her that the lies that she's spread about me are bulls**t and its not my fault that her last guy had a g/f and would've slept with anyone...?       Argggh! This is driving me mental. Are all people so incredibly petty and self absorbed? Please tell me coz if they are I'm running off to live as a hermit. :-(
20090308001049AAgr0g8	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it possible for parents to dislike their child~?	well.. im a 17 yr old with a 1 year old baby brother =) lately i just feel that my parents don't care about me anymore. I know that i need to be independent nd that im growing up and stuff, but i kinda feel unloved and sometimes i get really sad about it~   my mum who used to care a lot about me, and now hardly have conversations with me. whenever i try to chat to her etc she makes me feel like im wasting her time..   she can be very b**chy sometimes, and i can tell she ignores me on purpose, for example she gets REALLY absorbed in watching tv and just doesnt listen to what i have to say.   (i think that) she thinks buying me lots of things will keep me happy.. but it doesnt.    sometimes i try to talk to her a bit about feeling like this~ but she doesnt want to listen and sometimes gets angry at me for bringing up the topic..      lol i know this is a weird question..but do u guys think my parents don't like me..? or am i overthinking or something o.O~ some advice please =]

20090308001227AAWBsZ1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I approach this?	I'm a first year theatre student hoping to get into theatre production, and for the crew I'm working on for our current show, one of my assistant crew heads I've found I've slightly fallen for her.  I have only known her for a few days so far, but she seems like a really cool person, and she's really really cute.  We've shared a few smiles and laughs together, but I can't really tell if she's interested as well.  I don't have a lot time left with her, but I really cant flirt with her, because I take my work in the theatre seriously, and as I hope it will become a career for me, I want to display as much professionalism as possible.  Would it be too weird for me to pursue a relationship  with her, since she is technically my boss while working on this show(even though she is only a year older than me)?        Also just to note, that there is another first year on the crew who has been flirting with her, even though he has a girlfriend and he seems to be making more progress than me(that's not saying much though, because I'm really bad at flirting).  Though from the little I've known him, it seems like he does this to everyone.  He's completely unprofessional backstage, talking too much and too loudly during the show, goofing off, basically not taking the crew assignment seriously, as he hopes to make it into the acting program second year.      So what should I do?  Under no circumstances whatsoever do I want to sacrifice the professionalism, because this is my career, and I want to do well in the industry. How do I let her know I'm interested in the short time we have together at the moment(although if I get into the production stream second year, I'd be seeing her a lot more), and possibly see her again without breaking the boundaries of our roles within the show?

20090308042444AAg8YJx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think my boy still loves his ex?	i have a boyfriend and i think he still have a thing for his ex. they met about 2 weeks ago (they broke up about 2 years ago). the day before their dinner party his blog entry was something like this: thinking of you. (with a picture of his dinner at the time) and a date Feb 26, 2009. See, this is the birthday of his ex and they went out the next day to celebrate. and his entry after their dinner was a lyric from somebody' me by enrique iglesias (you will always be in my life even if i'm not in your life). i read the whole lyrics and it disturbed me. then he changed his relationship status in facebook from "in a relationship" to "its complicated".      i asked him before if he still wants to get back with his ex and he told me no, but after reading his blogs.. i think he does. i dont want to confront him yet because he's having difficulties with his work and he's preparing for an exam. i dont want to add to his problems. his test will be in two weeks.. and right now im depressed and have to wait until he's finished with his exam. do you think he still loves his ex? and what does "it's complicated" really mean?         The song goes something like this:      You, do you remember me?   Like I remember you?   Do you spend your life   Going back in your mind to that time?   Because I, I walk the streets alone   I hate being on my own   And everyone can see that I really fell   And I'm going through hell   Thinking about you with somebody else      Somebody wants you   Somebody needs you   Somebody dreams about you every single night   Somebody can't breath without you, it's lonely   Somebody hopes someday you will see   That Somebody's Me      is he just reminiscing or does he want to get back with his ex?

20090308045300AAVRqZG	Family & Relationships;Family	Please help!!! my life is completely messed up?	This is the story of my life read it completely to answer.   I'm a person living in India. Though I was born in high class and rich family, my parents never thought of earning a penny. My father inherited vast assets from my grand father. After getting such a huge sum of money, he went on to purchase big home, expensive cars and other valuable households. My father manipulated my mother (as she was from a poorer family), even though she was his second wife (his first marriage ended in 1977 because he never had stable employment and also he had one year daughter from his first wife (I never seen her only in photographs) at the time he was divorced). He had four brothers out which 3(including him) married second time (after divorce). I also have a sister who is 5 year younger than me. He always believed that through the knowledge of astrology he can always win huge sum of money (the thing that never happened!). Throughout my childhood he abused me and insulted me. Even for smallest mistake, he used to beat s**t out of me (and I mean it literally). When I was just 4 years old he beat me with stick and belt, stripped my clothes off and made me sleep naked in mid of December night on dirty jute bags, just because I scared that night to sleep alone and wanted to sleep with my mom and by doing this I was ruining his privacy. In year 1997 he inherited huge sum of money (nearly 5 million rupees) in form of stocks and real estate and in year 1999 he blewed all the money. At that time I was only 15. My studies came to halt and I suffered a major nervous breakdown. I stared to smoke. I suffered depression and usually had violent clashes with my parents. My sister's life was also ruined. As he discovered he is left with NO MONEY! He went on a selling spree. First he sold my mother's jewellary along with her mangalsutra (mangalsutra necklace is a Hindu equivalent of wedding ring), then he sold his cars and lastly he sold his house. This selling spree started in 2000 and ended in 2004 with selling his house. He and my mother were very superstitious. They always believed that the bad thing they are having is due to some evil spirit and spent a substantial amount on black magicians. I was expelled out of school when I was in 11th grade or high school due to non payment of fees (6000 Rs) where as at the same time he spent 11000 Rs on astrologers and black magicians. He sold his house in 2004 when I was 18. I completed my high school with biology with first division. I wanted to go to college. At the same time He said He wanted to move to another city in a nearby state as this city was always been unlucky to him. I resisted I said to mom "Mother... he is not gonna do anything as he never done anything so far. After going to that alien city our life will get completely doomed. For few months he will show that he is seriously trying but afterward he will lay down on the couch and would do nothing. Her*(my sister) education would go in jeopardy and she will dream to become film star. Me and you won't be able to do any thing. I  estimate that in just 5 years we would lose even our last penny. DON’T TRUST HIM!". This dialogue took a violent turn my father called police and somehow my mother begged officers not to make an arrest. Then we moved to new city. Where he treated us all as his slaves. I was not able to continue my study as I was not domiciled in that city. Private collages charged very large sum of money that was out of budget. Now it’s 2009.   (2009-2004 = 5years). We have lost the last penny that we ever had. My father finally disclosed that he was seeing things (“hallucinations”) since 1970, voices in his head were commanding him to do occult stuff. My sister is with my father's old friend who is a convicted murderer and fighting his case in higher court and currently is on bail. She calls him as her uncle. She wants to become air hostess. My mother is very depressed and screams out loud when tried to discuss this issue. For last 5 years we were living in rental home. Now I don't have money to pay rent. Everything I ever owned I have sold. Now I don't know what to do. I'm an undergraduate. Rigid social codes are also a problem (where parents are equal to god and can never do mistake). I think only way to end this nightmare is to wake up. That means I have to put this life to sleep. Please suggest me if you see any other way.      **Please Don't make Fun of my problem.   **Please Show me a correct way.   ** Then too thanks for reading and your response.

20060724091545AAv9mTt	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	So my parents are finally getting a divorce..?	We live in New York right now, and my Dad has finally decided he no longer wants to be with my mom and is moving to possibly Florida. I've not got a decision of whether I should stay with him or my mom.    I'm only asking you all this for your opinion so don't yell at me for asking a bunch of random people.   Im about 3 weeks pregnant (and i'm 16, please don't critize me about that either) and I get along with my mother more, but my dad has the money. Im quite afraid that if he moves he'll no longer want to be apart of my life.    He's not too crazy about me or the baby, but he has still invited me to come along with him.

20060806020252AATEpmM	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Lasciato dopo 3 anni per un'altro.....?	Sono stato 3 anni con una ragazza. Un rapporto stupendo. L'altra settimana torna da una vacanza dicendomi che ha conosciuto un tipo per il quale prova innamoramento. Si è resa conto che durante gli ultimi mesi cio' che provava per me era solo Un Grande Affetto, ma non era Amore. Questo tizio abita a 300 KM di distanza e si vedono una volta la settimana. Lei mi ha detto che adesso non è possibile tornare insieme poiche' nei miei confronti non sente piu' attrazione, cosa che invece prova per lui. Forse negli ultimi mesi la nostra storia si era adagiata parecchio, ma io ho sempre pensato: Ma aspettiamo vedrai che migliorano le cose...invece.... Adesso esce con lui.... Io mi chiedo come sia possiblie che LEI provi cosi' tanto per uno sconosciuto mentre per me dopo 3 anni bellissimi sempre insieme non prova piu' niente.....   Come devo fare? Sto soffrendo tanto, fino a 10 giorni fa era al mio fianco SEMPRE, adesso è al fianco di un'altro.... come posso Uscire da questo incubo?

I met a girl 6 months ago at a party through my friend, but she was his girl friend, during the party we had a moment where I thought maby something could happen between us, now shes broken up with him and Im half way around the world.    Anyway, she's long broken up with the guy which is neither here or there but we have been communicating through msn messenger, but not exactly direct chat or typing but she leaves these quotes on her message box that I know are directly aimed at me. I started this simi-encoded messaging system a while ago and it seemed to have caught on.     The other day she wrote "Lifes a ***** cause if it were a sl*t it would be easy" and I wrote back "Sh*t happens I just don't like being the a**hole", just to be smug and then she put  "Never miss someone from your past because there is a reason why they didn't make it into your future"    Ok! Now does that mean, she is missing me or is she telling me not to miss her and to move on?..or something?

About 3 years ago, I met this European guy in my college who I had a crush on for about 1 yr. I decided to write him a letter anony. & put it in his mailbox. For some reason, as soon as he opened the letter, he could smell the perfume that I sprayed on the letter. He then knew immediately that it was me b/c he always liked the way I smelled. For 2 weeks, we talked & took my breath away.. he is a very experienced, outgoing& liberal guy. I am the complete opposite from him. But the chemistry that we had was amazing.. He respected me a lot and knew that I was a good girl. One night he asked me if he could kiss me, I said no and I realized I was his first rejection..his eyes were watery...but one night, I gave him my first kiss. It was special, his heart was beating fast. That summer we left to our respective countries..I left him at the airport & the night before gave him a Letter with my info. he said he cried.. it has been 3 years & I have not heard nothing from him. I can't forget him

20070109033847AAjX6pi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some one explain this?	OK here's the deal. My girlfriend and I are going to make love for the first time. Finally we end up in her bedroom and she's all ready naked and waiting for me to get undressed. Finally after I remove the last stitch of clothes she burts out in uncontrollable fits if hysterical laughter. I say, "what, whats so funny?" She says," hold on I gotta get a picture" I said "why?" She says," cause you're so adorable". So I agree. A few days later, we end up at her female friends house for a party. Some of her female friends come up and say to me, "HI tiny" or "Hey little man" or "whats up shorty?"   This is weird cause I'm 6' 2" and weigh 180lbs. Anyway one of her female friends asks me, "So Rocky, has your nuts dropped yet"? I said," not yet ,maybe in a  couple of weeks , why do you want some?" She gets all mad and says,"&^$# you, ya perv". My girlfriend turns to me and says, "I can't believe you just said that, What the hell is wrong with you?" Anybody know whats going on?

20070118155736AAqwOgC	Family & Relationships;Friends	New kid symdrome?	Okay, so every 4 years of my life I've moved to a new school and new place, but I've never really had a problem of making friends until this school. I'm usually very outgoing but here I just act really shy around people. Don't get me wrong I have people I talk to, but that's it, I don't really have what you would consider friends. I've gone to the moives with people and talked to them and approached them, and their not totally ignoring me, they talk to me and are nice and stuff, they're just not accepting me. I really don't understand because in the school before this one, after about a week maybe two a new kid would fit right in. Does anyone out there have any advice on this? I mean, I've been to about 10 different school(sometimes I would move schools but in a county over, and I don't consider that a "big" move) but I've NEVER had this problem. Please help me.

I have read many questions on this site concerning "women who try to entrap men into relationships with them by having their child". It reminds me of a relationship that I once had. I once had a boyfriend who did not like to have sex with a condom, so I took the Pill (he probably forgot that I did). After we broke up, he wondered if I was pregnant; he even talked about it with me and smiled about it (by the way, we did not have sex after we broke up). He even BEAMED at the thought of me being pregnant (even though I told him I wasn't), just the way his face lit up. Once he saw again after that time we talked, he saw that I looked thinner (well, I am into Yoga) and he looked really pissed off. I haven't talked to him since, but I really wonder!

20070525070637AA1eDsn	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Que piensas de mi novia que apenas terminamos hace cuatro dias?	Hace cuatro dias que terminamos y ella ya recomenzo a llamar a un pretendiente suyo con quien anteriormente estuvo hablando. Yo me di cuenta que habla con el porque tengo acceso a su cuenta de telefono por internet, aunque ella no lo sabe. Ya habiamos terminado una vez y esa vez hizo lo mismo de llamar a esa persona.Independientemente de las causas por las que terminamos creo que aun no era tiempo de que ella abra su corazon a una posible nueva relacion o que al menos se ponga a hablar con ese tipo.   Algunas veces le pregunte que si ella hablaba con alguien durante el tiempo que duro nuestra relacion y siempre lo nego aunque yo sabia que me estaba mintiendo, pero al final de todo lo acepto y me dijo que si hablaban y que hasta se vieron en una cita, aunqe segun ella le sirvio para darse cuenta de que yo soy a quien queria. Este tipo de cosas causo muchos problemas en nuestra relacion, hasta que hace pocos dias terminamos pues solo discutiamos todo el tiempo.   Tu que piensas de todoesto

20070612090525AAsLckG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Control or wounded pride?	was given a booty instant message from my ex. Haha! I turned him down.       I  had broken up with him 4 months before because of some of the behavior on his part, but had really started to miss him recently. Then something happened with my neighbor (won't get into it). I wanted to get back together with him, told him about what happened. He blew up and didn't want to be with me anymore.      Back to the booty call im, he said it could bring our feelings back. I said his feelings for me could be there without sex. (Plus while we've been apart he's been with several women so I told him he could find someone else to have sex with). He wanted to get back together with me before, but when I asked him about his breakup fun, he got really defensive and told me to forget about him (HAHAHA, damn hypocrite).      Anyway, after the booty call attempt, he's been mad and doesn't want to talk to me. Is it wounded pride? Or just some bullshit control thing?

20090227130715AAZyfQm	Family & Relationships;Friends	How would you feel if your neighbor did this?	A while back my Mom gave a bag of me and my sister's clothing to our neighbors. She gave it too them because they said that the Purple Heart truck was coming by soon. We don't mind giving clothing that doesn't fit us to charity. But, our neighbors went through the bag of clothes and picked out what they wanted for themselves! Now, we do happen to be a little more fortunate financially than they are. So there was some nice clothing in the bags. Recently, one of the neighbor girls wore a pair of my jeans to school. (They used to be my favorite pair.) Everyone was giving her compliments on them. They were a nice pair of jeans! Like $70! At the lunch table, the girls were complimenting "her" jeans. They asked were she got them. And of course, with me sitting right there, she said confidnetly, "I got them at Nordstrom." Yea, I was pissed. I couldn't believe she'd say that. So, I just wanted to see what your reaction/opinon would be if somebody did this to you. Thanks.

20070804152544AAAsLxC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you let your mistakes get to you?	I always have a way of forgiving myself for my mistakes, but I've noticed a lot of people can't let what I've done go even though I can. Or they'll keep reminding me like they expect me to break down and keep saying sorry or just feel bad. I would apologize but I refuse to seccumb to other people's looks. I feel like sometimes people feel smug when you apologize or they want to see you feel terrible about it. I can't do that. I hate giving in. When I apologize I mean it but I don't like to agonize and make my heart bleed over the things I've done wrong just so people can get the upper hand or something. I just say sorry forgive myself in my mind and move on. So why can't others? It's not like they're perfect. Things happen.

20070611184528AAA2Kle	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	There is this guy that i used to like at school. We talk a lot and he complimented me a couple times this year and also once in latin. He said "my name is grazio" which means graceful. Once in the hallways he said Hey (my full name) whats up? And once when we were using the computers he kept on playing with my keyboard. And when soneone took my chair away i could've fall down if he didn't yell out Don't sit down(my name) and he was in the middle of talking with his friends and on my work after he signed his name to approve it, my friend added a happyface beside it. He didn't like it so he said that he will erase it(he said it while laughing) then he drew a sad face beside my name. sortof like this  Does he like me? Got any tips?    and while on the computers he kept looking at my way cause he was right beside me, i asked him why are you looking at me he said that his head can't move the other way but in class he turns his head the other way a lot.

20090227125948AAr5DzN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im afraid to ask this but......?	Here is an excerpt from my book. I'm 13. Be as harsh as you want to. Lille clutched at the wall with her sweaty, clammy hands, trying not to pass out. She didn't know where she was. "I must be hallucinating," she though. But she wasn't. This was real. Her mom was walking toward her, her arms open and tears streaming down her face. Except, except this wasn't the mom she remembered. Her mom had a warm demeanor like a crackling fire on a chilly day. This woman was cold and awful. She was whiter than a snowflake falling on the ground. Lille started shouting, except no words came out. She had gone deaf and mute at the same time. All she could hear was a familiar sound, so distant that it was barely recognizable. It would have been all for the better if this song was indistinguishable. For, at that moment, Lille knew what that tune was as her mom clutched her with her thin hands. "Why are you doing this to me?!" Lille shouted as she realized that her voice had come back to her

I don't even know that I would call this a crush, but I think Carlos Zambrano of the Cubs is extremely HOT. I'm not even a baseball fan. Didn't even know who he was. Saw him on TV one day and asked, "WHO is THAT?!"       He just looked HUGE and aggressive and kinda mean and like a dominant alpha male type. I find out he's 6'5" and 255!! I'm 6' and about 165 myself....so that's just as hot as it gets for me. I want to find his double. lol....Cos he's married with three kids! At 26!       But yeah....so, I told a couple friends I thought that guy was hot and they were both kind of surprised and "Ewww" and not thinking he's very attractive.       So, maybe it's not completely aesthetical... ;)       BUT. My question here is..... I want to know WHO YOU think is majorly attractive...... but you don't think is attractive to most people. I want to hear some weird stuff..... give me the why, too!       I was just thinking and wondering about other unlikely cases of hot pants. ;D

20090227130525AAjFCMc	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is it with women, who revolve their lives around a man/boyfriend?	I don't get it. I'm a 29 year old woman and I'm single. I have a friend that met a guy 2 months ago, and now revolves her whole life around him. She won't go out anymore and when we do make plans, she cancels. My 30th birthday is next week and myself and about 10 of my girl-friends are going to have a girls night out. Well my friend "Kate" who revolves her life around this guy isn't coming. The only reason she gave was that "she doesn't feel the need to go out anymore" now that she has a boyfriend, who she claims is "the one" and they moving in together already, after only 2 months of dating.      She can be with who she wants, but the fact that she isn't coming out for my 30th birthday is very hurtful. I almost feel like ending the friendship. Her 30th birthday was a few months ago and I went out of my way to attend and find a thoughtful gift. Am I wrong to feel this way?

We were together for over 2 years and lived together for one.  Im heart broken and i miss him so much but we just dont understand each other n i feel unappreciated.  Why does he call me if he doesnt want to work it out?

My dad is remarried and lives 45 minutes away in a secluded place so i don't have any friends there and so just the simple answer of moving with him is a difficult one to pick because then i wouldn't see any of my friends.

What can i do to help myself cope with the stress and hardships of living with a parent like her and also what can i do to get rid of this guy she hangs out with....he is bringing her down with her and i have already talked to her but she refuses to listen.

We've made rules to where we can't be alone. And if we want to go out in public, we have to go with friends... which isn't bad, but still.   I'm just so tired of not being trusted!

I have had a history of flirting with others and still do it. I also have a history of cheating on my ex-girlfriends. My girlfriend knows this and we generally quarrel about me going on the internet, going out, having friends because she thinks of my past. She thinks I will flirt with other people, find someone else or more likely cheat on her. I told her that I would not cheat on her I would split up with her first. At least I was honest. Are we always going to quarrel about this matter all the time?

20070508112125AAHae17	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have worms, I am freaking out!!!?	This is kinda gross, but I gotta ask.... Well I just went #2 and it felt weird coming out of me towards the end of the movement. It felt like something foreign was definitely moving and hanging. When I went to wipe, I tried to grap it with some TP thinking is was just some dangling poo, and I kept pulling and pulling it out of me. Then itwrapped itself around my finger. I freaked out and pulled until it couldn't be pulled any more. As I tugged I could feel it pulling internally in my belly. Well I kinda pulled it harder and it came out. I inspected it and realized it was a tapeworm. Furthermore, at it's head it looked like it was still attached to something, which looked like the lining of an organ (my intestine??) that ripped out when I pulled it harder. I began (and still am) bleeding profusely out of my rear end, and I have a very sharp belly ache. And I feel dirty because I'm afraid to finish wiping.  I felt another thing come out of me, and swiftly re-entered me. What should I do?

Tengo 15 meses de novio y al principio cuando la conocí  no me importaba nada de que ella haya tenido 3 hombres en su vida, yo tuve 1 persona antes que ella.   Cuando tuvimos relaciones la primera vez ella me hizo el sexo oral, y me saco de onda porque nunca lo había experiemntado, me gusto mucho y los dos lo practicabamos.   Pero ahora mi mente genera muchas cosas, ahora la quiero como madre de mis hijos.   Ella fue quien a los 16 dias de novios me insinuo tener relaciones, y me platica que tuvo tres hombres antes, que todos fueron amigovios en distinto tiempo, nunca haria el sancho. Ella ha sido buena mujer conmigo, me apoya, me ayuda y siempre esta alli cuando la necesito.   Pero en un futuro ustedes creen que me pueda pesar el pensar que ella tuvo tres hombres antes y mas aún si me hizo el sexo oral la primera vez,  se los hizo a los otros.     yo la quiero, lo mio no es pasion, pero yo no creo que si tu amas a una persona no te importa nada.

20070529080744AAefvVX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Estoy en una encrucijada y no se que hacer,puede alguien ayudarme?	Comenzaré diciendo que tanto el como yo ya hace meses no tenemos pareja y siempre hemos tenido algo especial.Entonces mi problema es el siguiente,el y yo somos muy amigos,pero el es como mas reservado cuando tiene un problema es de los que se lo comen solo,bueno el problema en si es que su esposa lo dejó y ahora después de 5 meses cuando ella se ve mal está llamandolo para contarle su pila de problemas,este es el tema tabu su ex y mi ex,y en verdad yo se por experiencia que cuesta salir de una ruptura,y el la iba superando hasta que ella a comenzado a llamarlo otra vez.Entonces creo que el se encuentra en una encrucijada y dice que el esta muerto y congelado por dentro que quiere estar solo y que no se merece que nadie lo quiera,Que hago? Le dejo espacio para pensar? lo animo? no se que hacer,le cuento como es ella en realidad? Porque yo se de ella pero sería impropio por mi parte contarle de ella

20070626180510AAHULaO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies please help me with this girl problem?	Ok I went to a small get together with a friend. Two 18 year old girls were there. I'm 23 btw. One my friend hooked up with and the other just broke up with her bf. Me and the single girl hit it off. According to her friend she wanted to kiss me all night. After I left she got my number from her friend and texted me saying how great I was. We all agreed to hang out again the next night. The next day the single girl asked where I was and when I was coming. When I came over we talked a bit and I even went and picked up the taken girls brother from somewhere because I'm a nice guy right. The taken girl comes the single girl stays behind claiming to be sick and would wait for us to come back. I sent a text to her saying get better and that I wish she couldve come. When we get back I get kind of bored and start getting distant from everyone from time to time because the single girl is sending too many mixed signals and the taken girl starts flirting with me. I later leave. I have since texted and called once to the single girl who has yet to respond in the past two days. I also texted the taken girl to see if they all wanted to chill at my place this friday but she hasn't responded either. This s**t always happens to me! Did I do something wrong? Should I just forget about them? Any ideas would be appreciated! Thanks.

Mia madre voleva anche conciarmi come un maschio! Anche prima di questo giorno, mia madre mi ha spiegato che mi potrebbero rapire e stuprare. Il risultato? Ora ho paura di uscire da sola!! nonostante mi sia portata uno spray al peperoncino, il cell. e un'allarme! Ogni volta che passava un'uomo lo fissavo terrorizzata e avevo anche paura di ogni macchina con uno o più uomini! Inoltre non vesto MAI in modo provocante, e tengo i capelli legati, cappello e occhiali da sole. Non sapete quanto ho sudato x prendere un pacchetto di patatine! Ora penso che l'unico modo per uscire tranquille sia andare con un rottweier nal guinzaglio!  Aiutatemi, vi prego, non posso vivere così!!

So I started sending him care packages like a PSP and games...etc. He never asked for the things..anyway I told him I was in love with him from 4 years ago. He then put on his IM ID crazy in love but won't talk to me just became a rock. I really just want to be with him and can't be with anyone else I told him this! Language is not the problem or the army..what is wrong with me...why he clam up on me like this? I know he cares! He is 21. I am so stuck on him and failed with other guys because I just want to be with him. He told me once he could never be angry at me. So I asked him do you mind if I l go back to America for vacation..?

LETS KEEP THIS ONE POLITE , LETS NOT BASH EACH OTHER .LETS PLAY NICE       Both men and women should know that even if a woman says she does not want a man to pay child support but the man fathers a child through a sexual activity (as opposed to sperm bank methods ) he will be liable for child support and that they can come after you even if your child is all grown up .       I do not know if the woman had malicious intent or she was just clueless on society looks at men fathering children and what there resposnibilties are .       I would say for now(even though i am highly skeptical) give the woman the benefit of the doubt that she has no malicous intent , that she is clueless .

20090227130726AAokQRp	Family & Relationships;Family	How to forgive and shake this grudge?	Being a Christian, you were taught to forgive. Yet, sometimes you don’t want to forgive; you’ve been hurt in such a way, that you want to hold that grudge tightly. My big grudge is against my brother, who banned me from going downstairs and using our home computer because I wouldn’t exercise. He even erased my file, so I had no way of going on the computer. In the end, I had to use my dad’s computer. Sometimes when I would fight with him, he would always counter by calling me a cripple. It made me so mad! Granted exercising was beneficial to my road to recovery, I just refused to do it. However, that didn’t excuse the name calling or forbidding me to use our home computer. I would be so mad and wonder, “How dare he say that to me? Who does he think he is, banning me from OUR computer? God? Ugh! I can’t WAIT to get my own laptop!”       It wasn’t long before I actually got my laptop, my baby Larry II. Also, my room had the best connection to the internet. And guess who came to ask to go on my computer? That’s right, my brother. Trying to be the bigger person, I allowed him to use it. But sometimes I would get annoyed when I wanted my computer back and he would be all like: “Wait!” Wait? Wait? Whose computer are you on? Mine! If I was on his PS2 or something like that and if he wanted me to get off of it, he would FORCE me off. He’s done it a number of times. So the other day he asked to go on my computer and I said “No”. He asked again. I said the same answer. He stormed off.  Whatever, I thought. I have a right to say no. It’s mine. I’ve shared with him A LOT more than I have to! So today is what got me to think back on what he did to me.       Anyway, today he comes home and talks to my mom about laptops and whatnot. He was telling her some laptops he found and prices. I was there and as soon as he said Gateway, I had to voice my opinion. I was just trying to be helpful. Gateways are bad laptops; they stink! He yells at me and tells me to mind my own business. Okay I get it, I should, but I was just trying to help. If you want a laptop, then at least get one that will last! So anyway my mom tells him to go get the Dell catalog that my dad usually gets. He starts looking for it, saying he can’t find it. So I say, ‘Why don’t you try upstairs?’ I mean come on, I love to look at the different laptop skins, so I usually take the catalog to look. He goes to me again and tells me to shut up and mind my own business. I was taken aback, again. I was just trying to help, but he was being a jerk. So he said something to me, then I told him to drop dead. (Yeah, I actually said it.) Then he tells me to go to hell. My mom tells up to stop and he storms upstairs. I hope to myself that he doesn’t find the catalog. He doesn’t. I smirk to myself, thinking that is what the jerk deserved. Then my mind goes back to all he did to me and I just get so mad. My mom says that he is a good brother, and I know that, but sometimes, Ugh! Jerk should now be spelled ‘Yonel’! So I was mad, saying to myself, ‘Get a crummy laptop, see if I care!’  I begin to wonder what would happen if he actually got his laptop: he would be in my room, that’s what! Unless we get our own internet, which I doubt will happen. So I began thinking to myself, I’m never letting him use my laptop or go in my room again! He’ll feel how I felt when he banned me from going to the basement, the jerk! But I know that thinking this way is eating me alive. I know I should forgive him, but I can’t shake this grudge. Every time he said the word ‘Cripple’ at me, I just wanted to cry. Honestly, I have a few times by myself in my room, in the middle of the night, so no one would hear or ask me what was wrong. How do I forgive someone like that?      I'm sorry that this is long, but please read and give me some advice. Thank you.
20090227131250AAQInBU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is the smart thing to stay or leave him?	We have been together for 4 months and absolutely love and adore each other. But he told me that there is no way he would ever marry from a college relationship. No matter how much we love each other and are happy, it's over after he graduates. I am the type of person who likes to see a relationship possibly go somewhere. But now I know it won't. I love him so much, I don't want to leave him. But at the same time, I don't want to be hurt even more later on.

He said he broke up with her but the damage is done now. Its a little late.       Why would he be that hurtful? How could you do that when your kid is being born?He couldn't even pick a decent one he picked an overweight Fatal Attraction that hacked and erased one of my e-mail accounts. Why couldn't he leave me for someone decent and not that circus freak.      What could he possibly have got out of that unless he gets off on knowing one woman is hurting while he's humping another.       Sick
20090227133416AAHPL5i	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I deal with back-stabbers?	I have a friend that is a kind of on and off. She knows my secrets only because she asks nonstop so I tell. About 2 days ago I told her I liked this guy and she said ok. All today she was flirting with him like touching his hair, joking with him, sitting by him and stuff. And then my friend leaned over to her and told her that he was going to the dance too. So I asked my that told her if she liked him? She replied no but they would make a cute couple.       I cried a tear or 2 really quietly, because I don't like to make a big deal over stuff. But I was down for the rest of the day. And I'm not going to the dance because I don't believe in competing over guys.   Should I remain her friend or just say its over?

20090307232622AAUcpWf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are the chances my gf will take me back based on this info?  Ladies?  Also is this a good idea?	I got dumped a few days ago and my gf said after she dumped she was upset and dissapointed.  So I thought she just overreacted and would take me back right away but the following day she said hopefully when she feels better about us I will still be there waiting for and if not she understands.  So what does this mean?  Yesterday I text her and told her I'm sure she hates me and I'm probably the last thing on her mind but I miss her I got no response until today she told me I'm not the last thing on her mind that I am always there.  So ladies what chance do I have that she will take me back and how long if she does in your opinion would I be waiting.  Also is it a good idea to send sorry flowers to her at home?  Or is that a bad idea?

20090308000311AAryvb0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I didn't want to ask but this is driving me nuts!!!?	Hi! Ok, I don't want to ask this question, but I have to know what you guys think.   So, I have a crush. One of my friends said that he likes me. I was like "OK" at first, and now, I find I really do like him. I have read tons of stuff that help you find if he's flirting or if he likes you and blah blah blah, but I still don't know.   He lights up when he sees me. He loves to talk and chat with me, and always smiling. He loves hanging out around me, and poking me, and stuff. He's really nice and kind, and is always trying to impress me. For example: At lunch today (I went with my quizbowl team, and he is on the team), we went to CiCi's Pizza. Well, this CiCi's had a small arcade, with this game. The game was easy to do at first, but at the very end it got harder, and then you would lose. The prize I wanted to win that it had, was and iPod Nano. I tried it a couple of times, and came really close. He saw how much I had wanted it. I kinda gave up on it, but he didn't. He told me "Brooke, I am going to try to win this for you." as he pointed to the prize. I thought that was really caring.   I don't know what to think. I know that it is driving me nuts, because I need to know. Oh, and at the lunch, he had asked me for my cell number, and we exchanged numbers. I don't know. What do you think?
20090227131813AA1l4qm	Family & Relationships;Family	I have a real problem with my 22 year old daughter?	She is a university educated professional ,good job-never been in trouble.   But she has such an attitude problem-you really cannot say anything to her-you either get a sarcastic comment or she flies off at the deep end.!

Any ideas?

After 25 years together my husband now thinks we should be separated but still live together and look after one another! LOL.   He seems to think that I will feel better about our relationship  if i don't have intense feelings of jealousy about his relationships with his ex wife and other females that he chooses to spend his time with.   I just think that this is an excuse to use me as a housekeeper,because basically that is all he has ever wanted.   His philosophy is-as long as I don't take my clothes off then it is all right.   I have put up with so much for so long-because of our daughter-do you think that this will work?

20080917000445AAbXIi6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Je voudrais votre opinion sincère sur la question suivante?	Imaginez deux cas de figure :      1) un couple (marié ou non) dont l'un des deux trompe l'autre (sexuellement), mais sans jamais s'attacher, se montre un conjoint(e) parfait à tout point de vue.      2) un couple (marié ou non) dont un des deux trompe l'autre sur ses sentiments. aucun des deux n'a de relations extra conjugales, mais les sentiments d'amour ont disparu et lui ou elle ne reste avec l'autre que par facilité, confort matériel...      Que pensez-vous qu'il soit pire ?   que la personne vous trompe (sans que vous le sachiez) mais vous aime et se montre un partenaire en tout point parfait   ou que la personne vous trompe sur les sentiments qu'elle ou qu'il a pour vous, même s'il n'a pas de relations adultères ?      Ceux qui me connaissent un peu connaissent mon opinion sur le sujet et je vous donnerai ma réponse à la fin.   Mercie      Et par pitié éviter les hypocrisies du style : il me trompe non mais quel porc, je le tue ce mec !   la vie est un peu plus complexe que cela !

20080927113037AAR1vd2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Est-il rationnel de croire aux visites d’extraterrestres ?	Lorsque les Conquistadors sont arrivés en Amérique à bord d’ofnis (objets flottants non identifiés), il n’a pas fallu longtemps pour que les habitants se rendent compte, pour leur malheur, qu’il ne s’agissait pas d’une illusion, puisque, peu de temps après, ils mouraient en grand nombre. Les gens qui soutiennent que les ovnis démontrent la présence d’extraterrestres visitant notre planète doivent expliquer pourquoi ces visites n’ont pas de conséquences manifestes pour nous ; pourquoi, par exemple, ces extraterrestres ne s’emparent-ils pas, mettons, de la Maison Blanche ? à cette question ? na?ve ?, on peut évidemment répondre qu’ils ont une autre psychologie que la n?tre, qu’ils aiment nous observer tout en étant discrets, etc. La question que je voudrais brièvement discuter est de savoir dans quelle mesure cette réponse-là est rationnelle. Pour ce faire, je vais comparer la croyance aux visites d’extraterrestres à la croyance aux miracles ou, plus exactement, appliquer la même règle de rationalité aux deux types de croyances ...

So I met a girl the other day and we were gonna hangout sometime since she lives out of town but is coming in for the fair this weekend. I've already been to the fair 2 times and don't want to pay to go again so what type of things could we do before she goes to the fair? We are already gonna go eat somewhere but don't know what else to do in the meantime. Keep in mind I don't know her too well so something to get to know her better would be cool. But also something where we have something to do in case the conversation pauses you know?  Im 16 years old btw.  And I know I'm gonna get the "you wanna ask her out dont you?"  I'm not sure.  I don't know her too well but its a possibility.  Thats not why I am hanging out with her though.

I never cheated on him, started horrible fights with him, was giving to him, etc. He seemed to be be incredibly in love with me and very obsessed with me. After he dumped me, for hardly any reason at all, he has been trying to make my life a living hell. He would call me and start threatening me that he doesn't want to be friends anymore for hardly any reasons to give. He keeps trying to pull me in and then push me out! I don't understand. Or he'll tell me he loves me and wants to be my friend and then will leave me in the cold and give me angry messages. What the hell is going on?

But lately, I have been worrying about him. He has a bad temper, for one- not violent, just annoying and obnoxious. He is very emotional and has a tendency to cry easily. He has accused me of being too clingy when in fact he is the one who is very clingy. Among his friends has a reputation for being "very clingy" yet he HATES it when someone else is clingy around him. He has also has extreme perceptions of his own friends, including me- either he will be mad at him and completely hate them at the moment or he will love and idolize them. When he made me extremely mad and left me in a bad situation a few days ago, he told me that he loved me deeply and that I was still special to him, but now, today, he called me, threatening to not be friends with me anymore. His friends right now can't stand him and some of them understand where I am coming from.

20090307230202AAiT8Kj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a girl do this to herself?	Im a sophomore and a girl in my grade who is kind of a slut (no offence) did something really gross. She was talking with this guy I guess she really liked or something so she did something really gross. She took a crap and then wiped it all over her face for the guy. Like 10 people saw her and i saw pictures of her on my friends phones and stuff. Now everyday people make fun of her and i kind of feel bad but then i realize that she is a total ******. The thing Im wondering is why the hell would she do that to herself. I mean i think she was drunk but still. I dont understand if she thought it was hot or something but what made her believe that putting her crap on her face would do anything. Why do you guys think this girl would put poo on herself?
20090307225448AAFtZUt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hey girls do you think she likes me? Easy?	Does this girl like me?   Ok so I met her around september last year. She is this really awesome girl, not only does she have this awesome personality she is extremely pretty too. I fell in love with her and I want to know if she might like me:      We are still in school      Positives:   -She always laughs at my jokes, even the ones that sound stupid   -She would walk up to me whenever she saw me with a smile   -She sometimes stares at me and points at me with friends   -She called me 'cute'   -She sometimes teases me in an innocent way   -The other day I was copying her in a test and she noticed and in a playful voice she called me a cheater. She then covered her paper and I begged her but she shook her head. I turned around doing my work and then she tapped my shoulder and let me copy   -She stands up for me, like when I am not paying attention she tells me what to say to the teacher, she replies when someone asks my name and when I am reading something I can't she quickly tells me in the ear how to pronounce it.   -This is on the staring thing, one time when she was alone I saw her staring in my direction she was like 7 feet away, then my friend came up to me and stood between me and her, behind him I clearly saw her leaning so that he wasn't blocking her view...      (Negatives)   -She always hugs her male friends, it is almost casual to her, when she says a friend she just walks up to him and hugs him. Friends that she met around the same time as me too. She has never given me a hug, and when I see her give one to another guy my heart breaks with jealousy...   -She talks a lot and even sends notes to other guys while she is sometimes quiet and shyish with me      Today I was with her in class. The guy behind me kept kicking me cus i kept annoying him (haha) and then I told her (she sits next to me) if we could trade seats. She asked why? And I told her, he is trying to kill me (refering to the guy behind me), she turned around and asked, why are you trying to kill him? If you want to kill him just stab him with a knife. Her answer sort of confused me so I said, yeah just make it quick and she laughed.      What does this mean?
20081223174225AADusUD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be worried? Does my boyfriend like my best friend? Are my friends lying? Please Help!?	Ok.   So I know this is not a very serious relationship yet but I have been dating a guy for a few weeks.      And one of my friends said that my other friend(my boyfriends ex girlfriend) said that my boyfriend is saying that maybe he just wants to be friends with me. But I called him, cause I felt that was better than being worried and paranoid and such. He said that he likes me alot, and he is in no way thinking about breaking up with me. Is it naive for me to believe him?      Also...   On myspace... he has soooo many girl's before me on his top friends. I am number 12. But oh well, it doesn't mean much. But now.... He removed me from the top and put my closes friend (whom he doesn't even know well since he doesn't go to our school) as his 2nd friend. Should I be worried?         And no. I am NOT in love with him. That would be silly.   And its AFTER I started dating him I became friends with his ex.   Also he is a sophomore. I am a junior.      Also. lol   I know my best friend isn't doing anything cause she has been dating a for 3 years and I trust her.   The myspace thing doesnt bug me much. But it kinda bugs me when all he does is read a message when I talk to him. But oh well ya know! He might be busy.   I believe what he said. But he has had a background of cheating... And it is always with his ex. So I am a little worried about that. But I know what I got myself into, and I am prepared if he does. Also... I have faith in him.

Im from Utah, I am a christian and I started masturbating when I was sixteen which was about a year ago.      It felt cool at the time and I did it daily and I started to get bad luck.      I especially feel like doing it when I know guys out there are doing it and having a great time and getting rewards.      Once you do it you dont feel like studying or playing sport.      I felt God was trying to tell me something, and I tried to stop. But everytime I try I cant give up. I seem to be tempted on the weekends and I dont know how to stop it. I need some tips on how to stop.      And is it that bad like once every week.

20090308005648AAMYDub	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do to help my best friend?	I was recently put into a psych ward, for a suicide attempt. I tried to overdose. My best friend was the first person I told, I showed her the empty packets because I needed guidance. She told one of my other friends and blah blah, She visited me in hospital. And I had talked to her about a few things before I was in hospital and I have talked to her a few times since. A lot was about Self Harming, and she was a very big self harmer over a year ago. She has been seeing the school psych which I was seeing, and now she will be seeing an outside counselor. Her mum won't let me talk to her because 'I'm causing her too much stress' We both agreed that we did not want to go by her mums rule and we continued being friends. I asked her if her mum was right, and she said a little. And the school counselor said that maybe me talking about self harm is triggering for her.      Now I feel really guilty. I've stopped talking to her about stuff and now we just hang out. But when can I do to mend things? I feel really bad

Some of my friends are married now and just want to do "couples" stuff.  They invite me along sometimes but I know it feels akward for them since I'm single.  (They don't know any single guys either).      With other friends, I feel like we just don't have as much in common as we used to.  They treat me like the backup plan :(      Aggh!!  It's so depressing - I used to have big plans every single weekend, and now this weekend, I don't have ANY PLANS!!!  has anyone else gone through this??

20090308000536AA92oOt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I like this guy...?	I really like this guy.  He's a really good guy (nice, warm, funny, smart) and we have a lot in common and get along really well.  The problem is that for the past few years, he and one of my friends were dating, and they were kind of like the perfect couple.  Everyone expected them to get married one day.  And now they've broken up, but I think they (he especially) still love each other.      So that's the situation.  The question I have is this: while I would never pursue a relationship with this guy (and I would never have tried to sabotage their relationship at all; I think these are pretty clearly bad/wrong choices), what would be the morality of getting together if it just sort of happened eventually?  Even like several years from now?  What are the rules on dating a friend's ex--including if you are no longer in contact with your friend?
20090307230338AAd3ozP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She said she was falling for me, and then just got rid of me? Who would do that?	I've been chasing her since october and I've stuck around for this long even though we are not officially together.       she is incredibly insecure and seems to have me on this pedestal. So a few nights ago we were out and I opened up to her about my past. I wanted to prove to her that I wasn't all that great and that she should stop thinking she's inferior to me. We finally had a serious talk instead of the usual flirting. everything was fine if not better, but...      After that night, she stopped responding to my calls and messages. Then she finally sent me a text message and this is what it said: "I'm sorry I just think youre putting on a sincere act to get me to fall for you til I sleep with you, you did a good job but I really don't want to get involved because I know you're just playing me for a fool, same story, different guy. this is getting ridiculous and I just think it'd be easier if you backed off a bit."       I know she loves me (and I love her too)... so why would she suddenly decide to walk away from it all? What should I do now?

20080324231601AASE0z7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when you realize you're ugly?	This is a very good question...someone asked it before. I think a better question would be, why do I laugh whenever someone calls someone else ugly? My friend was telling me how she was on the bus in a not too nice neighborhood and this crackhead was shaking back and forth. Then he stopped looked up and said " you know you're ugly right?!!!" to this little boy and the little boys mom just rubbed his shoulder. I thought this was hilarious, even though that kid may be scarred now. Then this lady on the bus said " you know you're an ugly bastard" and the guy started giggling. Oh man, this made my day.
20090227133250AAYZUPW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get him to leave me alone NICELY?

But now he wont leave me alone, its been less than a week and hes tried to get me to go to like 5 of his hockey games and go ice skating with him like 3 times. What would be a nice way to tell him I don't like him and don't want to be friends with him. Btw we don't go to the same school and live in different cities.

20090308001156AAJlRCp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested? Does asking her out (I'm gonna say hanging out) increase my chances of going out with her than asking online?

The fact that he's older doesn't matter to me...but he's about 2 leave because he's a senior and I'm just a junior. I really like him and want 2 make it work...and I think he likes me 2...but does the fact that I set the plans is that a bad thing? He asked me if my friends were coming..(we go 2 different high schools) and I was like...no why? It seems like he's shy maybe that it would be just the 2 of us? I text him and he doesn't text me...are these bad signs? He says sweet things 2 me..and he's such a smart, sweet, and caring person! Could this work...? What's ur take? Should I tell him I really like him? :D ANSWERS PLEASE!!! ;)

Okay so just for laughs my friend and I looked up my last name in the facebook friends search with no plans on finding anyone ever. My last name has an unusual spelling and anyway so it's actually my husband's last name not mine. My husband doesn't really know his dad's side of the family because his parents split up and his dad ran off somewhere the only thing he knows is that his dad is from knoxville. It just so happened that when we typed in this last name, up came only one person with that spelling and they are from knoxville as well. Is it possible I have accidentally stumbled upon my husband's long lost cousin? What is the likeliness of this? The last name is the same unusual spelling and they are from exactly the same place my husband's dad is from.       Hmmmmm.....      Thank you!

20090227131847AACP4ZB	Family & Relationships;Friends	ADVICE about friend problems?	Sooooo. Theres this girl. She goes to my school. We used to be the best of friends. I mean, seriously everything in common. We would laugh at anything and everything! Well, now I consider her the meanest and most inconsiderate person I know. She constantly talks about me behind my back, pretty loudly I might add. She brings up subjects she knows I don’t want to talk about in front of everyone. She turns all my friends against me. She constantly puts me down like, “why the heck would you even do that?”.. and crap that just pisses me off. She nice to everyone but me. And people can tell the difference. She’s so two face. She can be “nice” to you one day and then talk trash about you the next. She starts things, she likes attention and drama. Its obvious. She calls me flirtatious, but I am NOT the one climbing over desks for attention and putting their body parts on guys (hands, head, etc.) She has to get the last word in every conversation. I’ve told people about this problem. And they think shes jealous and insecure. Because, as sophomores, why the heck would you act that way. Real mature…. And this isn’t the first time all this has happened. It happened last year too. Come to think of it, she never really was a good friend to me. She’s ALWAYS used me. And ive always always always been there for her as a friend to come to. Hmm. I really feel like punching her right now. But I know violence doesn’t solve anything. And if I confront her, she is just going to turn it around on me.  I hate confrontation.   Gosh. Advice?

I told him I can pay for you if you promise 3 things to do, like look after house doing the garden, clear the rubbish in a house.   Because house is full of stuffs can not walk inside house.   (He lives himself)      And when he finish his university, of course he submit his work many month later behind the due.   I wish I was not live in this world.

20090227132020AA4ykxL	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I bother trying to locate my daughters deadbeat father?	I am a 31 year old grad school graduate who is happily married with 2 of my own children as well as a live in step daughter.  I have a daughter from a previous relationship.  About 2 years ago I decided that carrying the financial burden on my own was to much.  I petitioned the court for a paternity test so I could receive child support.  I never proved paternity because they never could find him.  I went on usa search found an address and found him.  He called me saying that basically I was loose and he wasn't sure if my daughter was his.  He asked the court for a DNA test.  The DNA test proved that he was the father and he asked for counsel.  He never returned to court for any of the subsequent court dates.  He reported to the Bronx circuit court that he moved to staten island and left forwarding information.      Should I try to find the deadbeat.  Or should I let everything slide.  My daughter has a loving father who helps with her and actually is supportive and here.  My only fear is that she has several siblings and I feel as if I have damaged her opportunity to get to know them by even asking for money.  Am I wrong?

20090227133314AAUrMFx	Family & Relationships;Family	Who is right my mom or me?	My mom and I are fighting over something and do u think i should be grounded or not?      When i woke up today today to go to school i told her that we were going to have a substitute driver and a different bus so she said be out at 8:00 instead of 8:05. I said ok and was getting ready. I had my entire book bag packed, coat on, and was just putting on some Axe before i had to go. I looked at the clock it said 7:56 and then i heard my mom scream my name so i ran outside in case my bus was coming. She didnt hear me say i was coming so she started to run to the door, because she was outside taking the dog out. She slips, falls down, and accidently breaks one of my dog's leg. The thing that makes me mad is it  wasn't my bus. Remember this all happened before 8:00 the time my mom told me to go out! My question is should I be grounded or not? I am very confused about what i did, and why it's my fault.

He says its not fair that I stay home with him and he never gets too. I have only been married to my husband for 1yr and we have been together a total of 3yrs. He loves my son as his own, but i get mad at him for saying that its not fair that he doesn't get to stay home with my son when he is sick. Its not often that he is sick but when he is sick he will sometimes need a breathing treatment or two (he has sick related asthma). I don't doubt that he would know what to do or even question him in anyway about taking care of our son. But when my son get sick i don't think about whether or not who gets to stay home i just think I have to stay home and make sure he is ok. Is he jealous or is there something I'm missing?

20071129133624AAVKJIt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Someone please tell me what the deal is.................?	I've been seeing this guy for 2years now. We don't do anything together. We hook up every month or so and spend the weekend layed up in  hotel. Everytime it comes to the planning he's like, "my money is funny" and it makes me feel weird. He's paid as have I, but I've paid more. He has these request or fantasies that he wants to play  out , but at my expense. When I confront him, he weirds out and won't respond to my emails or he'll just change the subject. I hate feeling like I'm being too hard on him becasue I do have trust issues and I am a skeptic. I just feel like a jack *** because I like him, but I don't know how to go about making him see that I've got feelings and I hate to be used.

20080101125913AAm4fNS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ive been seeing a guy for 18mths, he keeps his feelings so guarded. He says he loves me but i need more, im 38	he is 39, we both have financial security, neither have children, or been married, but we both had very serious relationships at the age of 17 which lasted in both cases for 10yrs, neither of our parents approved of our, then partners who we still concider friends. I love him to bits, & he says he loves me, but it took him about 8 months to tell say those words. I am totally excited about spending the rest of my life with him & have his children, but he gives me no 'signs' we have a future. He constantly tells me how wonderful i am & how happy i make him, & how we bring out the best in each other, but i want/need some commitment. i've told him exactly how i feel, & that i cant wait forever, infact ive told him that if he gives me no sign things are moving forward i will walk away 6wks from now (i named this date in sept),  i feel so sad knowing i am trying to force this to a head & i might lose him but i think he will happily continue as things are for yrs, am i doing the right thing??

20090120031647AAsK5Dy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Comment savoir si une femme est vierge en ayant jamais eu de relation sexuelle ? En gardant toujours sa virgin?	De nos jours, des filles ont recours à un médecin, un gynécologue ou un simple généraliste, pour obtenir un certificat de virginité avant leur mariage, pour des raisons culturelles. Après un examen, le praticien délivre un certificat à la fille attestant qu'elle est supposée être vierge. L'examen se fait généralement par observation directe de l'entrée du vagin. Le médecin donne en outre un petite description du type d'hymen observé (élastique, fin ou très fin, souple, etc.)   Ce certificat de virginité entra?ne des questions d'ordre éthique, mais aussi un problème médical. En effet, toutes les études confirment l'extrême difficulté de certifier l'absence ou la présence d'une sexualité prénuptiale, même en cas de rupture évidente de l'hymen. Une importante proportion de cliniciens ne sont pas en mesure de décider si une déchirure partielle de l'hymen est corrélée avec une activité sexuelle ou pas.    Les études montrent que l'altération la plus fréquente de l'hymen après une pénétration vaginale est une rupture partielle du bord libre, alors qu'une rupture totale est exceptionnelle.

20081110170042AA6WHug	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this come off as sarcastic? How could I word it so it doesn't?	ok, so long story short, there was a girl I l had a crush on. I told her. She didn't like me back. I asked if it was fine if I talk to her anyway. She said yes. I talked to her for a while but now she has stopped talking to me and I have discovered that the only reason she talked to me in the first place was out of pity. Here's what I'm going to say to her, does it sound sarcastic?:         I understand now that you would really rather I didn't talk to you anymore. That was probably your desire all along, but you felt pity on me and talked to me anyway. Had I known that was the only reason you were talking to me, I would have put an end to it. I'm sorry I was foolish enough to believe that you actually wanted to talk to me. I'm sorry I put you in a position which forced you to repeatedly lie to me to in order to consulate my emotions. I should have known and just left you alone from the beginning. I'm sorry. I won't bother you again.

All 3 of us were best friends last year. We got in a fight and worked it out though.  For a few months we did not talk but we are on the right track now.  They are not my BEST friends anymore but I hang out with them maybe once a week or once every two weeks.  There is also a boy in my neighborhood that I use to really like and he got involved in the fight between me and my friends and we as well did not talk for a while.  It is very clear that I do NOT like the boy and would just like to be on friendly terms with him.  A few nights ago we all hung out and it went fine.  My parents are being really stricked about my freedom of hanging out with them. Its really getting on my nerves.  Iam a straight a student and do my chores and i am overall a responsible girl.  Why are my parents being so strcit   (they did not act like this a year ago when i was younger and less mature).

20090307221237AAtIU45	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why couldn't I kiss him?	I have been going out with a guy for two weeks today...we've known each other for about 2 years. I really like him, but for odd reasons. (I'm a complex person. :) Anyways, today we were together and about to leave and we're not sure how long it will be before we see each other again. So my guy goes in for a kiss. This is not the first time! I want to kiss him! I think about all kinds of things! (I am a virgin.-Not to kissing amongst other things)      Was I just too nervous? Or could their be other reasons. What should I tell him? He was disappointed, this was the third time I've turned him down. Should I ask him to help me be more comfortable? All I could tell him before I left was that it has been a long time. And he was like, "A long time since what?" I said, "Since I've kissed someone." He said, "Me too! Just kiss me, (my name)."       Background: My last relationship was with a guy who was a waste of time. I don't think I liked him. We grew up together and I guess it was of convenience that was 2 years ago. We were together 4 months and I never kissed him while we were together because I felt forced. He didn't force me, I just didn't want to!       I actually want to kiss my guy now. I just couldn't. Actually, I let him kiss my neck after a while and I was okay with it. It was progressive, but I didn't have to do anything...it was mostly him...      ANY suggestions?

20090308003256AAPu2ws	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i fix this girl situation? 10 points best answer?	might as well just tell the whole story:   a few months ago i stepped on this girls jaket. so i went and apologized to her and offerd to wash it. she said it was ok, the whole time when we talked she was all smiley and happy, she got red in the face, she made me feel so happy. so i thought to myself should i pursue this and see where we could go. so i did, for weeks i saw her stare at me around school and in class, she told all her friends about me, we would talk across the classroom and again she would smile. when we passed by eachother i would wave to her and she would just stand and smile and say hi. then the end of the class was coming like in 2 weeks, but for some reason i could not get myself to talk with her, idk why i just couldnt, but when we talked i wasnt nervous at all. so a week went by and i thought to myself i should ask her if she wanted to eat lunch with me, so i did. she said yes but when the day came she said she couldnt because she was too busy with homework. i dont believe her tho. so then i just took the hint that she just wasnt interested. so the class ended and occasionally i would pass by her around the campus but everytime i did she would kinda retreat. for ex. one time i was walking and i saw her coming out of a classroom, and she just said hi and went back into the classroom. so i told my friend about it and he said he would talk with her sister about it. so he did, then he told me what she said, she said she isnt interested and she thought the jaket ordeal was creepy. i just dont get why she cant even talk with me, i just want to no where i went wrong. because everytime i saw her and she saw me she would smile, get red, and look all giggly.      and i have been thinking if i should just forget it, but i really want to apologize to her, but idk how to do that if she cant even talk with me.   and i dont want to be her bf i just really want to meet her.   what do you think?    i really want to talk to her about it but i dont know if i should.   thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and to answer.

20090308013802AAZwfKm	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why The Sudden Change in engagement? Does it have Anything to do with iraq?	So before my boyfriend left for Iraq he was saying he can't wait till he get's back and how he wants to propose to me when he gets back because then he'll have the money for a nice ring, and while he was in Iraq is emails always said he can't wait to marry me and how i'd make a good mother.   Then like two weeks before he came home all of this stopped and he's stopped talking about getting married.    Today (two months after he's been back) I brought it up. He said he still wants to marry me but we need to slow down and take it more slowly.   I asked him why such the dramatic change from before, like if i did something wrong and he said he wasn't sure why, and that he needed to spend more time with me.          We're in a long distance relationship and I come home to him for good in about two months so i understand his reasoning it makes more logical sense than what he was talking about before.       Any ideas as to why he had this kind of sudden change?

TODAY I FEEL LIKE A FOOL BECAUSE I THINK I AM A WEAK JUDGE OF CHARACTER & NATURE, BECAUSE OF THIS!      1) I had a whole group of rocking friends during graduation.[{(Now we are away from each other but we have phone contact & also meet occasionally)}] There was a particular female friend who was very dear to me. We were very good friends. Then she started to show her real colours. She dumped us for some guy younger than her. Then she ditched him for some other guy. She proposed someone whom she used to call 'brother'. She called her mother insane in front of others. She took to smoking & drinking. She started to spread our phone numbers to bad guys. She started spreading rumours about us, fought with a guy & a woman & also got beated by them! . (THERE are many things that she did but i cannot mention HERE). Our whole group was hurt by her behaviour. Now she is away from us but she always wants to know about us. She says that she was always right & we were always wrong. Huh! We always used to think for her good. The rest of my friends knew her since 3 years. I knew her since 5 years. I couldn't judge her or see her real self. I feel ashamed of myself & terribly hurt.
20090308014604AA6mTB3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	2 Guys want me, but I only want the 3rd guy who doesn't?	Okay,      At work I have two guy friends who I often work with on projects.       Let's call them "Sam" and "Harry"       They are both smart, pretty good - looking and both completely nice! They both flirt with me but when Sam does Harry looks away and doesn't talk. I ask Harry if he's okay and he nods quietly but he's probably more outgoing and talkative and comic than Sam.      Thing is I want the third guy (I'm going to call him "Jon").       He lives an hour and a half away but I see him every fortnight to a month because he's my best guy friend. I've known him since I was 3 months old and he grew up together. He knows I like him following an embarrassing. And really don't know what he feels. I keep bringing up opportunities like drinks and lunch. He meets up with my sister and brother at my house for cards once every month since that was an important part of our childhood together which we enjoyed most. But nothing ever happens. My older sister thinks I should leave it.      And I'm starting to wonder whether I should just ask Sam or Harry and leave Jon as my friend?

20090308015451AAlmcdp	Family & Relationships;Family	My brother is abusive and I can't handle it anymore.?	My brother is abusive to me for stupid little things. For instance when I put my alarm on for school i didn't wake up straight away and he came into my room and through my phone on the wall. Other times he just hits me and calls me a slut. I'm 17, and his 19 (almost 20) and its been happening for almost a year and a half. My mum moved out about a year and a half ago and I don't speak to her (she lives with her bf) and my  dad just doesn't care (his in another state). My brothers not home everyday, he goes out a lot and comes home once every 2-4 days and it just sucks when his here. Other then that I'm home alone. I'm getting depressed about a lot of things! He has given me a lot of bruisers and I just hate him SO much. I really don't know what to do and sorry if i sound like im just talking too much.
20090308014200AAY2ic3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IS IT POSSIBLE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE YOU DON'T TALK TO?	I'm not sure about my feelings. He was my friend, then my boyfriend (but it was like 2 weeks, I can barley even remember it) then when I had my first serious boyfriend, he was my best friend in the world, like i guess i sorta cheated emotionally on my boyfriend with him cause everything feels so right when i'm around him. And while I was with my boyfriend, he started dating this other girl and I told him I still liked him, and on the same day he broke it off with that girl. (he won't tell me why) and now this year, there's sort of a tension between us since he's been making friends with seniors since they're headed off to college and he wants to get to know them better, while I like smaller groups of friends better. And now we aren't talking much (like, it's been a year) , except a few times and in those few times I'm not sure if he still likes me or not. Like it was just me, my friend, him and his brothers playing WoW. And he says things like      "Wow, you're such a skilled player!"   and I say "Shut up! You know I suck!"   and he says "You're pretty too!"   and the other day we were playing and we were teammates, just the two of us and he kept saying:   "Come on! We can take on all of you! Just me and Millie!"   he kept saying things like that for 2 hours, and I said: "hey, I have to leave in 20 mins." and he said   "Millie! You're so boring! You have to leave! BORING!!" and I said   "Fine! I'll leave!" and he said   "No wait! What if I want you to stay? What if I want you Millie? What if I want you?" and I think he said something like that but his voice got lower and lower through the sentence.

More than anything, even though I have a degree I'm not financially dependent. I'm a housewife and I allowed myself to get out of shape on top of that. I used to be a an athlete with a great body, now I'm really self-conscious about my body.       I want out of this marriage asap. It's been 11 years. I can't be married to a 'kid brain' anymore.       I want to know that it's possible that one day I will be free and find an intellectual man that I am craving. I want someone that I can learn from and share ideas with. I feel like I've been mentally and emotionally clouded by an immoral man. It's hard to sort through what's 'real' anymore. Can a husband and wife have an intellectual and respectful relationship? How soon can I free myself from the thug that I married? He steals, lies, cheats, mocks me, embarrasses me in public. I hate going outside of the house with him. I hate when I'm out engaged in my societal obligations and I feel more free because he's not around and am disappointed that I have to come home to him.       I want to make love. I want to know what it feels like to be ONE with a man that I love. I'm tired of being forced to play a role out of my husbands porn collection. Is it possible that a man will make love to me without needing to smack me to get off?

20090308014358AAsW0gO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help!!! my life is completely ruined?Please help Urgent!!?	This is the story of my life read it completely to answer.   I'm a person living in India. Though I was born in high class and rich family, my parents never thought of earning a penny. My father inherited vast assets from my grand father. After getting such a huge sum of money, he went on to purchase big home, expensive cars and other valuable households. My father manipulated my mother (as she was from a poorer family), even though she was his second wife (his first marriage ended in 1977 because he never had stable employment and also he had one year daughter from his first wife(I never seen her only in photographs) at the time he was divorced). He had four brothers out which 3(including him) married second time(after divorce). I also have a sister who is 5 year younger than me. He always believed that through the knowledge of astrology he can always win huge sum of money (the thing that never happened!). Throughout my childhood he abused me and insulted me. Even for smallest mistake, he used to beat s**t out of me (and I mean it literally). When I was just 4 years old he beat me with stick and belt, stripped my clothes off and made me sleep naked in mid of December night on dirty jute bags, just because I scared that night to sleep alone and wanted to sleep with my mom and by doing this I was ruining his privacy. In year 1997 he inherited huge sum of money (nearly 5 million rupees) in form of stocks and real estate and in year 1999 he blewed all the money. At that time I was only 15. My studies came to hault and I suffered a major nervous breakdown. I stared to smoke. I suffered depression and usually had violent clashes with my parents. My sister's life was also ruined. As he discovered he is left with NO MONEY! He went on a selling spree. First he sold my mother's jewellary along with her mangalsutra (mangalsutra necklace is a hindu equivalent of wedding ring), then he sold his cars and lastly he sold his house. This selling spree started in 2000 and ended in 2004 with selling his house. He and my mother were very superstitious. They always believed that the bad thing they are having is due to some evil spirit and spent a substantial amount on black magicians. I was expelled out of school when I was in 11th grade or high school due to non payment of fees (6000 Rs) where as at the same time he spent 11000 Rs on astrologers and black magicians. He sold his in 2004 I was 18. I completed my high school with biology with first division. I wanted to go to college. At the same time He said He wanted to move to another city in a nearby state as this city was always been unlucky to him. I resisted I said to mom "Mother... he is not gonna do anything as he never done anything so far. After going to that alien city our life will get completely doomed. For few months he will show that he is seriously trying but afterward he will lay down on the couch and would do nothing. Her*(my sister) education would go in jeopardy and she will dream to become film star. Me and you won't be able to do any thing. I I estimate in just 5 years we would lose even our last penny.DON'T TRUST HIM!". This dialogue took a violent turn my father called police and somehow my mother begged officers not to make an arrest. Then we moved to new city. Where he treated all as a slave. I was not able to continue my study as I was not domiciled in that city. Private collages charged very large sum of money that was out of budget. Now its 2009.   (2009-2004 = 5years). We have lost till the last penny that we ever had. My father finally disclosed that he was seeing things (hallucinations) since 1970, voices in his mind were commanding him to do occult stuff. My sister is with my father's old friend who is a convicted murderer and fighting his case in higher court and currently is on bail. She calls him as her uncle. She wants to become air hostess. My mother is very depressed and screams out loud when tried to discuss this issue. For last 5 years we were living in rental home. Now I don't have money to pay rent. Everything I ever owned I have sold. Now I don't know what to do. I'm undergraduate. Rigid social codes are also a problem (where parents are equal to god and can never do mistake). I think only way to end this nightmare. is to wake up. That means I have to put this life to sleep. Please suggest me if you see any other way.      **Please Don't make Fun of my problem.   **Please Show me a correct way.   ** Then too thanks for reading and your response.

I am 19 he is 21   He has loved me for 2 years   He cares for me a lot but I don't care as much as he   He takes care of me when I am in need   He has helped me with my school, taking exactly the same classes    He never hangs up first   I see him everyday because I do not have anybody else to befriend   He threatens to kill himself (and me sometimes) when I say I want to leave him   He is not attractive   He does not show emotions of love unless I do first   He does not communicate well with me   He is not successful   I pay most of the time   He says everything will be perfect if we just lived together    I have spoken words that offend him many times yet he still loves me no matter what I say or do   I am his first ever girlfriend and his first ever kiss      Bottom line:   I am scared because I do not love him as much as he loves me and I am scared I will never find another man who will be as caring and loving as he is and is always with me... But I do wish I could not be with him and be happy with somebody else. But I am scared of that somebody else also. In my situation, what would you do? And what would you suggest to me?

20090308013841AA1Dtb2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men is it harder to break up with a girl who is really pretty- if so why? WHy Are men such visual orientated!?	I Mean if you have fallen out with a girl and dont see her for a few month would you tend to forget the fall out more and be more liberal if she is really pretty?
20090308014132AAiN40S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls befriend guys because they are attracted to them?	I recently had this girl try unbelievably hard to become my friend in one of my classes. She would single me out from across the classroom, and basically find excuses to talk to me everyday. She looked me up on facebook and even gave me her phone number without my asking. Keep in mind she was not doing this to other guys... ONLY ME! So I got to know her better and made a move on her. She told me that she sees me as a friend, and that shes  friendly with everyone!?!? Have I been led on here???

20090308015049AAnC6n3	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I propose to my gf after being given an ultimatum?	After a year and a half living together, my girlfriend lost her job, her older brother got engaged, and she pushed the issue of committment and marriage: commit by July or we break up.  I love her, but I am not ready nor do I think that I'll be ready by her ultimatum's deadline.      Factors that I have been considering: my job security, her decreased health, my lowered attraction to her, and her money issues.
20090308015031AATPd0V	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with your friend who always wants male attention?	Well.. she's been my friend for over 10 years now but recently we've grown apart because she always spends her time with guys... and she seems to have a new boyfriend each week :S.    I feel as though she only wants to talk to me when there's no one about.   And whenever I like a guy, she'll instantly try and flirt with him! I don't know if she means to do it or not but... it gets pretty darn annoying.   She's told me once that she only acts this way because she feels lonely and I sympathise for her but sometimes I just feel like I'm being taken for a ride.   Any advice?
20090308015301AAOoBta	Family & Relationships;Family	Assalamualliakum Brother/Sister?	Assalamualliakum Brother/Sister      I am a refugee and my elder sister proposed me to be resettled in Australia.As soon as I arrived with my little children in Australia,she and her husband told me to pay them Aud$7500.00 including interest; because, they borrowed the money from the bank to fund my program.However, as soon as I finished repaying them,i realised that the money was not paid by them but was paid by the Australian Government for me and my children.Also, i entrusted them with my bank card to control my finance as i was new to the system.    I demanded half of the money from them but they boycotted me.Afterwards, they demanded an apology from me because, they brought me in Australia and she is the elder one.    I told them over my  dead body. I will never apologize them because, I did not do any  wrong to them;and it is God Who brought me in Australia. I asked them if  God would have decreed that the rebels killed me and my kids  during the war, would you have proposed me to come to Australia?       This prompted me to request a print out of my bank statement.To my surprise, there was nothing left in my account;she was also taking money from my account without my knowledge.   I was shocked!! I told my sister that you have  cheated me . Since then she is not talking to me.      My question is:    1.DO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND THIS MONEY FROM MY SISTER AND  HER HUSBAND?     2.IS THERE ANY RULING IN ISLAM THAT WHEN AN ELDER SISTER /BROTHER DO WRONG TO HIS/HER YOUNGER  SISTER/BROTHER , THE YOUNGER SISTER/BROTHER SHOULD APOLOZISE THE ELDERSISTER/BROTHER EVEN THOUGH THE ELDER SISTER/BROTHER HAVE  DONE WRONG TO THE YOUGER ONE?

20090308015351AADQ6oB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if a guy likes me more than a friend?	I am friends with this guy and lately we have been getting closer. For example the other night we were hanging out and talking about how hard it is to put yourself out there when asking people out. While we were talking about this and other things i was resting my head on his shoulder and his head was on mine. He was also holding my hand and laced his fingers with mine. He seemed to get more touchy feely with me - we had had a drink but weren't drunk.   Does he like me or i am reading too much into this? Help me i'm confused and not sure if i should make a move or not.
