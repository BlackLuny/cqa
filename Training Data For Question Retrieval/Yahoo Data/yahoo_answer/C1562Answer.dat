G8UG87ZSaa	Not quite sure what the previous posted was refering to...an Argentine peso and just a peso are the same thing - no matter where you travel in Argentina. A peso is a peso.    I was just in BA and here are the prices (in ARS) of a few things...    Subway ticket - $0.90  Bus ticket - $1.10 - $1.25  Taxi - depends where you want to go. A short trip will likely cost $4-6 pesos.  Wine - prices vary depending on quality. Stick within the $15 range in you'll be fine.  Lunch - assuming you don't go to a super fancy restaurant, expect to pay $25-40 per person, including everything  Dinner - assuming you don't go to a super fancy restaurant, expect to pay $40-60 per person, including everything  Travel Expenses - round-trip bus ticket to Crdoba, for example, is about $300 or so|`|tQsxsuNPaa	I think an Argentine peso is worth one peso in B.A.      Hey, are you going for the purpose of becoming fluent in Spanish?  Be aware that the accent in Argentina is considered....un poco raro....and that you want to stay for a full year.  Just plan for it...you will learn SO MUCH MORE!

4pco9j9Faa	I live in Baltimore!    The suburbs of Baltimore are very nice, mostly all are nice and clean. They are also fairly free of crime.     THE CITY, however, is crime-ridden and dirty. There are rats in the alleyways and pidgeons on the streets. The Inner Harbor has some nice places to shop or visit, but again, the harbor is polluted and the water is GREEN SLUDGE. Oh, and the city has some great art museums.    I like the city lights, but the weather kinda sucks. In summer it can get up to 100 degrees and is very, very, VERY humid,. and in the winter it can be close to 10 degrees. I suppose there is a normal amount of rainfall, and definitely not enough snow. (Though i guess its the same. I just want snow more :))    Overall, I like Baltimore County the best because it is quieter and safer. But the city is fun to visit...

It will take you about 15-20 minutes depending on traffic. Alturnatly you can catch the Victoria Line from Kings Cross Tube station to Oxford Circus.    As for the London Eye, you will need the South Bank. You can either catch the tube to Waterloo station and then walk from there or you can catch the 59 bus and get off at Waterloo bridge and from there its a short walk to the London eye.    You can use the journey planner on the TFL website to plan your trips using public transport|`|NhWvvJ4saa	um well you could walk it,turn right out of kings cross, and continue along euston rd to tottenham court rd its about half a mile, then another quarter mile to oxford st.and it would be best to take a bus to westminster bridge for the london eye.|`|YH0Rl5M5aa	don't know how to get from kings cross to the london eye, but im 100% sure it's not within walking distance    i sometimes get the 73 bus from kings cross to oxford st..takes about 15mins so that is within walking distance..|`|AA11349530	yes, Kings Cross to Oxford Street is walkable, but it would take you about 45 minutes ... easier is to jump on the underground, take the Victoria line southbound two stops, it will only take you a matter of 10 minutes or so    it's much further to the London Eye and it would take quite a while to walk ... again use the underground ... the easiest station to go to would be Waterloo ... take the Northern line (not the City Branch, take the one that goes through the West End) ... it's only a 5-10 minute walk from Waterloo station to the London Eye    have a look at the underground map  http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/s...  details of tickets and prices on  http://www.londontoolkit.com/briefing/tr...|`|AA12218857	Seriously, you'd be best off catching the tube!  Take a look here:   http://journeyplanner.tfl.gov.uk/user/XS...  This link allows you to type in where you want to go from and where you want to go to. It tells you how long the journey will take as well.    To get to Oxford Street, take the Victoria line (the light blue one going towards Brixton) from King's Cross and get off at Oxford Circus - it takes 5 minutes. Follow the exit signs and you come out right in the middle of it all! To walk there, it would take 40 minutes, according to the LU website.    To get to the London Eye on the Underground would take you about half an hour, with a little bit of a walk afterwards.  It's quite handy for you actually, because to get to the London Eye from Kings Cross, you have to change at Oxford Circus anyway! So, if you are going to Oxford Street first, you've made half of the journey towards the Eye already!  Anyway, to get to the Eye from Oxford Circus, catch the Bakerloo Line towards Elephant and Castle (always be sure that you are catching the train going the right way - if you're ever confused, take a look at the maps where the platforms split (here's what I mean: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Image-... - see how on the wall of this picture, on the right, there's a white poster thing? That's an illustration of the line - when you're at Oxford Circus, make sure that you get to the platform that has Piccadilly Circus as the next station along the line!) When you're on the Bakerloo line, get off at Waterloo, and from there, there will be signs and/or station guards to tell you where to go - it's about 10 mins to the London eye from there - have fun, and seriously - don't walk the whole journey! Even though my explanation makes the Underground seem awful and complicated, it's really really easy :D

YBbumuyFaa	They need to control their population.|`|q7mActnmaa	I'm sure the people of China would love to have the freedom to choose how many children to have and I have to say I agree with that too. We're so lucky here in the UK it's sometimes hard to imagine what it must be like to have these restrictions placed on you. I did see a report which was broadcast during the Paralympics where it said that China has 8 million disabled people but because disability is seen a shameful thing these people are almost hidden away. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the report was that if a family has a disabled child they are allowed to have another in case the first one doesn't live for very long!! I'm sorry but that is so very wrong. This is a country which needs to realize that all children are precious regardless of how they look or what disability they have. Everyone is born equal, it's only other peoples views that make them unequal.|`|8G42oyydaa	The policy is because of the high population, China has taken sensible, responsible steps to prevent extreme poverty and hunger in their country.  People can have more than one child, however they have to pay all the medical expenses involved in the birth, and pay other costs associated with education etc.  Peasants are allowed to have more children, to help their parents farm.    Re: other posters rant, China has disabled persons just as other countries, there are ads run regularly on TV urging people to accept the disabled and give them a chance to participate as employees and part of society.    China has excellent social programs, free housing and a much higher and fairer disability pensions and Senior Pensions and benefits than any Western country does.    You will get answers from people who have NO clue what they are talking about and couldnt find China on a map of the world. People who have never been to China and are just spouting media garbage they heard.     The one child policy has created an interesting family situation for young people whereby they have no brothers or sisters and no cousins either. The only relatives they have are their parents and their Grandparents.  One result of this has been the fascination andpreoccupationn with "young love" among students.  These young chinese men and women have NO exposure to people of the opposite sex, as in siblings or extended relatives and it has had an impact on their society.  A number of female high school students told me they have no experience in how to pick a good husband because they have had no exposure to males, other than their fathers and classmates.    If western populations treated their children as well as the Chinese do theirs we would live in a much better world.    The Chinese parents these days are just as thrilled to have a daughter as their ancestors were to have sons, believing a son was preferable.  Female Chinese children are treated like princesses.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	With 1.3+ billion people in the country, it's probably a good idea.|`|VP8TiqEmaa	Its necessary, if they did not implement it going by chinese culture their population would explode to a size unmanageable. Plus you technically can have another child you just lose a few rights and get a fine I think.|`|AA10254694	It's one too many.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	Most westerners view the one-child policy as an authoritarian and draconian measure that destroys the traditional family structure, creates a male-female imbalance, results in an older median age of the population and as one of your previous answers stated, "is so very wrong." What many people fail to see is that without the one-child policy it's believed that there now would be between 300,000,000-500,000,000 more people in China and on this planet than if the policy was not implemented. It doesn't take a genius to realize what the effect would be on dwindling fuel supplies and prices, global food shortages, poverty and pollution. You might say that China's sacrifice has resulted in a better place for the rest of the world. Instead of only looking at the negative aspects of the one-child policy of which there are many, maybe it's a policy that other countries should begin looking into, something needs to be done about the world's population.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	Parents are allowed to have more than one child in China, it just costs money. It seems everyone I know here has a sibling. There are many exceptions to the rule also, minority groups are exempt. If a parent has a mentally or physically disabled child, they can have another, if both parents are only children, they can have 2 children. Also rules are pretty lax in rural areas    Look that is women that just had octuplets, she had 6 other kids and is not married. Can she support them all? As Americans we feel it is not the goverment's job to tell you how many kids to have, but the government have to pay for the kids people can't support.    I have never heard anyone complain about the policy in China, although I have been asked how many kids American families are allowed to have. I don't think they realize their country is the only one with the policy!    One negative is abortion rates are through the roof. But that is a combination of the policy and talking about sex and sex education being fairly taboo.|`|V9xCaV1raa	It's rude, but there is no other good choice than this one. What would you do if you are the learder of the government?|`|a6JZjRG1aa	it's better than total famine as it was in ancient times...|`|9IjSqqLBaa	I live in Mexico, and I've never been to China, but I believe children are something people should talk about, think about and make a plan for before they even decide to have them.     They're, as opposed to what many people think, NOT a gift from God. Our sexual apparatus is made to enjoy sex (of course) and to make children, but it doesn't mean a whole life should come, unplanned, from a moment of enjoyment, or lack of control in your ejaculation, should it?     Children born in a loving atmosphere is what this world needs, and what could make a difference for our uncertain future.    I see in my country many young ladies carrying around little babies. Young girls who barely have a life, and little, or no experience at all, taking care and pretending to play a mother's role which they're obviously not yet suited for.     It's most certain that these little babies, with no father's guidance or a guidance from a father whom we could think of as boy himself, are bound to grow up in an (most times, I think), atmosphere of doubt, emptyness, distance, no communication, marital fights lack of money, lack of love, etc., etc, living then their lives in a similar way, and probably bringing other children to be very similar to them, a very poor contribution which is bringing more and more dissatisfiedness to the world and unpleasant events like the ones we see today.     The Chinese are doing the right thing.     I mean, tobacco is regulated towards people under, what is it, 18, 21? and so is alcohol.     Then, why shouldn't something, as important as giving birth to a life, be equally regulated?    It is unfair to think that abortion is a bad thing always, isn't it? I mean, there's a period of time in which the baby doesn't even begin to feel or perceive anything at all.     Why think it is morally bad to end up something which is not even alive yet, and instead allowing this entity to eventually grow a conscience and then be born in a home without love and, most likely, a life full of difficulties?     That's even worse than whatever fines the Chinese government may be imposing on citizens not complying to this one child policy.    I'm sure my country would be much better if people realized than before being a parent ,one should first learn to be happy and responsible, so then this knowledge could be passed on to the children, thus generating human beings with self-esteem and values and then a world with less egotism, corruption and stupid fights could arise.    I often see here rules that are not followed by everybody. People who "know someone" and therefore are either granted permission to, or forgiven for faults most of us would just not have a chance to.    If the same rules applied for everybody here, I would have no reason to complain about the things I can't do, but I often see people who could get a license for this, or a permit to do this or that, doing it right before everybody else.     Favoritism here is much worse than any one child policy in China. It makes me think of big, spoiled, moustachoed babies who want all the cake for themselves, and are not willing to share it with anybody else.     I'm sure the Chinese have accepted this policy and then are able to move on to other things. I think it's clever.     Maybe the Chinese are thinking that countries as conflictive as some we all know, or as corrupt as mine, should be taking on a similar policy, so that less conflictive or corrupt people in the world would be born.     I wonder if there is a question on this on Yahoo Answers China, but I don't know a word of Chinese.     Will you let me know?

Just come prepared for the rain with a good rain coat :)
X8326PVZaa	Isla Verde, Condado and Old San Juan Hotels are pretty close to the airport and to the cruise ship pier. You have to make sure of what pier your ship departs since there are two, Old San Juan and Pan American pier. They are opposite in the same bay. Either one, they are in the same area and a short cab ride away. If your ship departs from Old San Juan and you do stay there, you can walk to the pier in Old San Juan.

1OmSZUvLaa	You may be able to get a lower rate, depending on when you drop off the car in Seattle.  The cheapest way to lower your price on a one-way rental is to cut the amount of time.  For example if you pick up in SFO and drop the car off in Seattle within a day, you'll only be charged a higher rate for the one day.  Then you can rent a separate vehicle for your stay in Seattle.  Or, if you need the car in the SFO area for the majority of the rental, return it back to SFO and rent a separate car for just  a day to get to Seattle. Try and keep the one-way car rental down to just a day.    Hope this helps!

AA12159695	Okay those two guys are correct with the scam warning about Nigeria, but that doesn't mean that you couldn't get a job in Nigeria, just be weary of common sense stuff, I just came from Nigeria (I was born and raised there) and it would make sense that ISP business is booming, because that is an important tool in trying to fight the scammers, butof course the scamers also have ISP business. now to answer your question, it depends on where you live, it can from  200,000 a year to   500,000 and those will probably be places that will meet your standard (well close to it) if you are coming from America|`|BUCvr0R8aa	You had best watch what comes form Lagos Nigeria I had someone try to rip me off by having me send them money.

Unfortunately, the Pirates are operating again in the Caribbean.  There have been a number of pirate attacks against yachts operating around Trinidad and Tobago and about a year ago, an Austrailian was MURDERED in a pirate attack while at anchor off Venezuela.. There have also been attacks off Mexico, Jamaica, and some of the Windwards over the past few years... so PIRACY has never REALLY GONE AWAY... just the romantic ones you think of.. the REAL ONES are still there.    Unlike these people on here who answered this question who have never been out the the State where they were born.. I keep a real watch on piracy in the Caribbean because I live here much of the year and I am still doing CHARTERS during the winter months... so knowing what is going on with piracy is a matter of life and death and not just a mental exercise like it is for some of these people who have never even BEEN in the Caribbean.|`|91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	there in the caribbean right now!

eD7qRBKHaa	They do not let people ride on the floats.  It is an insurance risk, and they cannot do it.  They do select people to be the Grand Marshals of the parade each day.  These people walk in front of the parade and are announced as they go.  Often, they walk way in front of the parade.      They choose people first thing in the morning when the crowds are just coming in.  There's no way to be chosen, they just choose at random.  You cannot pay for this experience.    http://allears.net/tp/mk/gmarsh.htm|`|rSq790ksaa	I've never seen this occur. Sometimes Cast Members who are in the parade will get kids off the sides and dance with them a little bit but it's not like they're going to actually put them on the floats. You can't buy your way into the parade either.|`|54tW840Oaa	no you can't ride in the parade unless they tell you that you are which is rare, the little kids sometimes at the end get taken by the characters and  walk a little of the parade route, im not sure if they still do that though.|`|QP2U8B6faa	I read in a travel book that one of the parks has a little parade people can join in.  It's not like the big parade with the floats and characters and stuff, just an impromptu one with regular people.  I know I read it in the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World, just don't remember which park.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Yes you can.  Every parade (at least at Magic and Animal Kingdom) a couple people are selected about 30 minutes before the parade starts and asked if they want to ride in a float.    However don't expect to be selected and there is no way to ask in advance to be chosen.  They select at random from whoever is closest when they are about to start.  There is no harm in asking a manager about 30 minutes before the parade though.
UmYPXY32aa	Fares are subjected to change anytime. If you want to book for September 2009 then the best thing is to book way earlier than that.    You can check this travel agency online:    http://www.redtag.ca/ - I've used this for my travel more than once and have found some fares to be cheap than the other depending on dates    It would help where in Canada you're from as there are a few places in Ontario that would fly to London.    http://www.flyglobespan.ca/  http://www.canadianaffair.ca/    You could also check airlines direct:    http://www.aircanada.ca/  http://www.airtransat.com/    Hope this helps.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	Sorry, but there is no realistic answer to your question. When you consider all the cities in Canada and all the cities in Europe, there are many possible airlines. There are probably many thousands of possible fares. Even specifying London doesn't help much. The fares from Vancouver will be a lot different from the fares from Montreal.     Even a professional travel agent could not help you with so little information.    You can check out the possibilities for yourself. Go to any good travel website. I suggest Kayak.com because it shops many different websites for you. You can try different combinations of cities and dates and see how it affects the fares.    No one can predict the best time to book. Airlines adjust prices throughout the year based on supply and demand. Prices might be higher in May. They might be lower. Even the airlines don't know right now. They do limit the number of discount seats per flight. Once they're gone, the price goes up. When will that happen? No one knows.    In general, booking earlier is better because of the limited number of discount seats. However nothing is guaranteed.

I don't choose partners by nationality, and if there was personal chemistry it doesn't matter where they're from. But a Northern Irish accent (and a good singing voice) would help their cause, I like eastern European accents too. :)|`|0yTM98Odaa	If I had to choose Irish or Italian   But a mans nationality doesn't bother me.|`|tTiBQ4Isaa	I don't judge by the colour of their skin
z4Yrn96Paa	Check this site for routes and times: http://waytorussia.net|`|xi9amEG2aa	www.google.com has maps and so does www.mapquest.com      There should be something on both of those somewhere that says something to the effect of 'Find the Shortest Route'|`|AA11925366	The fastest way is of course to fly, though I don't know if that is the answer that you want. Harbin has an international airport so theoretically you could go through customs there, charter a plane and fly straight to Moscow. I don't think you will find any regular Services operating between the two and if there is the frequency of which they depart will be so low that you may even find it quicker to take the train.  Apart from chartering you can fly into Beijing and then transfer for a direct flight to Moscow. That would most likely be the fastest conventional way to fly. Other options would be to go via Seoul or Tokyo which take longer but depending on what day of the week it is the connections may be faster. To be sure you'd have to do some research on all the flight departure times.  Overland: no the train isn't the fastest though it is a lot more reliable than going overland by other means.  Of the train journeys you can get a train from Harbin North and cross into Russia picking up the train at Blagoveschensk. This is probably slightly quicker than going via Vladivostok which requires a bit of backtracking, and definitely faster than joining up with the Beijing-Moscow trans-siberian route as you have two border crossings which are always slow going overland.  Still overland it's approaching a journey time of a week when flying is a fraction of a day. So hands down the fastest way is to charter a plane, but honestly who does that nowadays.
L1HVLylMaa	You buy it in cuba, very likely to be legit|`|vl6OtBfWaa	You buy it in the Cuban government store the box is sealed with a government stamp of authenticity.    You buy on the street it ain't authentic.|`|8kIE1Dswaa	What do you mean "legit".    There is a wide range of "Cuban cigars" - from the finest hand-rolled cigars, to cheap peso cigars made by machine and sold to the average Cuban.    There are also various counterfeits sold as good cigars.|`|AA11754165	I manage a cigar shop...  While in Cuba, look for La Casa del Habano  go to the following link to know where it is:  http://www.lacasadelhabano.cu/site/conte...    To buy in La Casa del Habano, the Habanos S.A. franchise is the only way that you can be sure that what you buy is the real deal.    The rest of the stuff even if you buy it from the streets, you know for sure that it did not go under the strict quality control that the ones sold in the official stores go through.|`|RhkKGsipaa	Take them to your local tobacco store, they should be able to tell you.  I've bought cigars in Cuba on the beach and brought them back for friends.  Obviously they are Cuban cigars but they lack the certificate of authenticity.  My friends have said they were pretty darn good even if they were illegal.
W5VRYpaNaa	June 4th...!!
S0uCKptBaa	My friends and I do girlfriend getaways frequently. We normally budget $100 per day for food and drink, but it depends on how much you plan to eat out and drink. One way to cut down costs is to go to the store once you get there and buy your alcohol and a few snacks or breakfast items. It cuts down on the cost you spend dining out and drinking. Also July is low season in the caribbean so you can find hotels for a lot cheaper. What my friends and I do is to get a vacation rental. It's often cheaper than a hotel and provides you with a lot more space and privacy. Puerto Rico has a lot of nice affordable rentals.|`|oTPfxusYaa	I think that $500 per person will be more than enough for food and alcohol for a day. Unless you're gonna go everyday to a restaurant. If you are gonna buy the food and cook it, it will be enough. Same thing for the alcohol, if you're gonna buy the bottles and make your own drinks it will be enough. But drinks are expensive in the nightclubs. I paid 11 dollars for one drink of Baileys and one drink of Vodka/Passo?/Cranberry the other day. And it was in a town out of the metropolitan area of San Juan. Normally nightlife in San Juan is more expensive than in other cities/towns of Puerto Rico.      Hope I was of some help!

Continental, Delta and United Airlines all fly into San Salvadore and I would take any one of them over TACA.|`|HvyE4qpYaa	I agree with Hondu... TACA is the WORST.

5FSw2lHgaa	Kartel is God-less, he openly admits that he knows he is going to hell, what else could one expect from him.|`|ybNa4oubaa	Ok here's my opinion, yes they may be adding fuel to the fire but they are definately not the source. They need to start blaming the Government that ruled, robbed and wrecked this country for years. They make it impossible to find employment and then bash the youths when they use they're talents to try and survive and make it in life. We need the corruption and idiocity to stop! That's what we need!   I think there needs to be a distinction between reggae and dancehall though because i hear them blaming dancehall artistes for destroying our reggae music and i just don't get it, they are 2 totally different genres. Dancehall portrays the culture of the ghetto while reggae is more uplifting. I personally love dancehall and as i usually say when i hear a gun tune i sing along, i'm not influenced by the lyrics, but i'm an educated individual who is not from the ghetto. Solution, eliminate the slums and poverty, give the ghetto youths an option and i'm sure they wouldn't turn to the gun because they all know if they live by the gun, they die by the gun. Deal with the damn source! because i'm sure that if dancehall were to somehow be erased,gun men and criminals will continue to rob and kill because that is all they know how to do, they have no choices, no opportunity to do better...give the ghetto youths some hope! Give them a future!|`|XeYDJOBjaa	no one blames kartel more like movado|`|hOZ8uk3Raa	Kartel .. is not the really the primary source... but he is making a bad situation worst .. what makes it more problematic is that its not illegal and he makes money from it ... so who is to blame now?
ypyqWxlgaa	I am so sick of all the questions about "which is more ghetto", "where's the worst place", "why is Detroit so dangerous" and other crap about Detroit having a bad rep....      Detroit is a big city, it has it's share of crime and poverty, BUT so does every other big city throughout the world.  The world is bad enough already, and people are struggling everywhere.  Why do people choose to focus on the negative?  Having tunnel vision and prejudices blocks your view of what is great about a place - and shows your ignorance.    My suggestion to you:  Go explore Detroit.  Go explore Windsor.  Make your OWN comparisons, instead of relying on the media.|`|PvPPivLJaa	Uh Detroit?

fT6VVji9aa	Turkey is very cheap and very interesting.  If you go, being an architecture student, check out the old homes down by the water in Sultan Ahmet, which is the most interesting part of Istanbul.  The great architect of his time was Sinan and some of the buildings he designed and had built are just amazing.  They are all still standing after almost 600 years.  Topkapi Palace is also very interesting, architecturally speaking, as well as all the treasures in there and the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia [or Aghia Sophia].|`|0yTM98Odaa	Central Europe would be nice for a week.

IVSqQQzlaa	Canada's Wonderland is a great amusement park.  It's a lot of fun.  Marineline has rides too but also has different animal exhibits like dolphins etc. Niagara Falls is a lot of fun.  There are lots of interesting places like Ripley's Believe it or Not and a couple of good haunted houses (Nightmares is the best) etc. and of course the falls itself is amazing.  Go for a ride on the Maid of the Mist (a boat that goes right down near the falls) for fun.    I like Ontario Place but it depends what you're looking for.  It's right on the lake and has interesting exhibits.  If you're going to be here during the CNE (Canadian National Exhibition) it is attached to Ontario Place.  You might also want to check out Toronto Island.  You take the ferry over and it has a small amusement park and other things to do.  The ferry ride is fun too.    When you are traveling from Ottawa to Toronto I would recommend you take a side trip to the Thousand Islands and take the boat cruise through the islands - very cool - not to be missed!

When Scottish Local Government was reformed on 15 May 1975, the Regional Council covering West Central Scotland was called Strathclyde (even though the Regional Council extended far beyond the confines of the valley!)    Strathclyde Region has since been abolished, but both the Police Force and the Fire Brigade were unchanged and so retained "Strathclyde" in their name.    Accordingly, your question is impossible to answer since whichever definition of  "Strathclyde" is used, the area is too expansive to be specific - sorry.|`|57rbgBw2aa	Make sure you take self defence and hard drinking lessons before you visit then go out on the town and join the Meleeeeeee.... enjoy yurself babes.|`|MNja3iwMaa	strathclyde is a region, you need to specify what area , name of place he lives in. not a great area.
puyAEPZyaa	I would recommend you stay at Caesars Palace, but be sure to look for cheap room rates on the internet because they are definitely out there. Caesars is located in the middle of the Strip, has an amazing pool area, and hosts some of the best parties in town at PURE (keep an eye out for celebrities).    Good luck and have a great trip!|`|urHPuzMsaa	The Tropicana would be your best bet. Good location, nice property and great prices. Easy to get around from there. Most of the shuttles use their parking lot for picking up and dropping off.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Treasure Island and The Mirage might has some very good cheap rates. Palms is pretty nice as well.|`|o0qKaUyMaa	Here are some LV downtown hotels with good price:    1, Super 8 Motel Downtown Las Vegas        --  Around $53  http://compare-rate.my-discount-hotels.c...

You may find more hotels, compare the rates, dates, maps, photos and customers reviews.|`|NS9yqfT6aa	If you plan on continuously returning, stay somewhere downtown.  I recommend the Fitzgerald's.  I gamble moderately while I'm there and they are always sending me comped rooms and free slot play, plus the machines seem to payout a lot better downtown and the minimums are quite a bit lower then on the strip.  One thing you should also consider is what nightclubs are you going to?  When I go, I'll stay at the Palms for two-three nights for the clubs. They have Moon, Rain, and ghostbar.  Guests of the hotel usually get at least front of the line passes, if not, comped admission... if you have four people that's $80-120 per night you'll be paying in covers.  The Palms is also four times as nice as the Fitzgerald, so there's even more incentive to pay a little more and get a little more.  Beware though, if you're planning on hitting up clubs like LAX, they are privately owned, so as a guest of the Luxor, you receive no perks.  Contact me if you need more information.  I try to get out there about 5-6 times a year and I've stayed at pretty much every "main" casino (strip/downtown/outskirts/etc)    Check out the Palm's nightly rates on i4vegas.com, they often do the buy one night get the next free.. or if you are going relatively soon, try to name your price on priceline.com.|`|JLA2Wncfaa	Some of the people here are recommending downtown hotels such as Fitzgeralds,  4 Queens etc this is not a good place to go if the action that you want is on the Strip nor for people who have not been to Vegas before. I love downtown but I would never either stay there for the entirety of my trip nor with people who had not been to Vegas.    Prices at the minute are very low and you may surprise yourself  with what you can afford. For budget I recommend Excalibur (start at $30per night) , big clean hotel great location and despite what you may hear it is not full of kids. Luxor (from $40ish) is a little nicer with great clubs and bars though the location is not quite as good as Excalibur but there is a walkway and monorail connecting it to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. MGM is slightly more expensive ($50ish) though there are some good deals great hotels and very large standard rooms not to mention great pool and spa and good loaction connecetd to NYNY and Tropicana by footbridge and it has a monorail station. If you want a bit of luxury try Mirage this is constantly priced under its level (from $56ish) its a luxury hotel and all the rooms have been refurbed fantastic location and great pool this is both my wife and my favourite hotel on the Strip.    I would also recommend avoiding Imperial Palace, Tropicana and any property North of Wynn none of these are anywhere close to as nice as Excalibur and the price difference is neglible     http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2009...

6d920711f9f980a9e93a140db57c7709aa	What's your budget?   I've lived in Long Beach 3 years and its amazing what I thought was once expensive is something that I now consider affordable. My 70-year old 1 bedroom apartment 2 long blocks from the beach is $1100 per month and that's pretty cheap considering it's a pretty nice place with a good view. My neighbors are also great.   Like Mad Dog and Peedlepup said, the affordable places are in neighborhoods you don't want to live in. LBC has some shady 'hoods.   You can look on craigslist.com for apartments, but you really need to come to the area and look around. Most of the apartments here are not corporate owned complexes, but small 8-20 unit buildings built between the 30's-60's. They tend to just put For Rent signs in front of the building.     The 2 companies below are apartment management firms that have several properties in Long Beach. Their web sites have all their rental properties on them.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Yes. California in general is expensive!    As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City (soon to be), it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.    You will also need about $10,000 to start off.    Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.    Bottom Line: Look elsewhere, in 3 months you will probably be back in your hometown with no improvement whatsoever.    mnhregfkdvbskdsavbiewg - While North Long Beach might be, all of Long Beach is not a ghetto.|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	yes, it is. it is also ghetto|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Yes.

q6CWdCQGaa	This is what we did and it was the best vacation ever!    Madame Tussuad's wax museum~ We took each others pictures with like 100 different wax celebrities, you can go right up and touch them! The pictures are so funny! Located at the Venetian    Bodies the exhibit~ Real human bodies! It shows how your different systems work! It was really neat and I sometimes forgot that I was looking at a dead person. They preserve them so well! This is located at Luxor    Blue man group~ Funny show with a lot of action. I would elaborate but I don't want to ruin the surprises! Venetian    KA~ Wow! Best show I've ever seen! Action packed and amazing! The stage moves and is very dramatic! MGM    Rides on top of Stratosphere~ Very thrilling, I'll never do it again, but I'm afraid od heights!    Gambled~ I'm not a big gambler, but Vegas brings it out in me. I always think I'm gonna win something! It's fun entertainment and free drinks, but set a limit.    M&M's world~ This is neat. Four levels of M&M tshirts, mugs, candy and anything else you can think of. There is a neat walk through on the third level. It's a tunnel with a spinning thing around you and it makes you think you are dgoing to fall! It's free and fun! And there is a free 3d show that's funny! Next to MGM    Bellagio Fountains~ This makes me want to cry. You just can't explain it, you have to see it! Very beautiful! Bellagio    Freemont street light show~ Four block canopy of high def tv screen with a action packed show every hour. This too you just have to see to believe! Downtown    Driving down the strip~ There';s nothing else like it, do it more than once because you will always see something new! It takes your breath away! You'll never forget it!    Dancing heads~ They put your face on a small body that dances crazy to upbeat music. They record it on dvd and it is halirious! Downstairs and MGM    Rollercoaster at New York, New York~ Okay, eveyone's been on a rollercoaster, but it's different when it is attached to a hotel. It's fun and exciting!    People watch~ anywhere! People come from everywhere to visit vegas! And they do weird things and wear crazy stuff!    Eat at the carinal world buffet at the Rio! Oh my gosh, I can't think of any item that they don't offer! It's awesome! And when you are done watch the free ariel show. They have floats that circle the entire casino and they throw beads at you, You can ride on one for $12. They have a really neat bowling alley!    Beer pong at O Shea's~ There is a ping pong table and you throw balls in the beer, it's fun. It's next to flamingo.    Welcome sign!~ Go as soon as you arrive! It is such a "high"! Get your pic taken with it. It's a great way to start the trip!    Have fun!|`|rUvaitfLaa	I'm 29 and lived in Vegas over 20 years, I could offer suggestions but there is little info to go on...how many people?  Ages?  Do you like clubs or bars? Entertainment?

Feel free to email me I will gladly give you some info :)|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Depending on what you want to do, you can do those things and take advantage on the free attractions. There is Circus Circus with the free midway acts. There are many other attractions as well, but too many to say. You can also visit downtown if you want, they have the Fremont street experience which starts at dusk, it looks real nice.|`|UMdaHXv7aa	Depends on how your age?.. are you over 21?|`|5ta5yyWSaa	We stayed at the Venetian for a convention but won more money at the old district on Fremont.

Room rates vary but don't buy online unless it is from a trusted source. My niece lost her entire vacation payment as the web site was fraudulent.     Most of the action for younger people is not in the casinos, but in the endless hotel pool parties for out of town visitors.|`|xif22nwoaa	We've done some fun things in Vegas - we've gone twice and these were some of the highlights.  We stayed in Caesars the first time and the Venetian the second.    *Elton John's show was fantastic, although his run was ending this year I believe  *Penn and Teller was hilarious   *Wayne Brady was very funny  *We ate lunch at the top of the Stratosphere, and then hung out on top enjoying the view.    *We took a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, which included a landing in the canyon - amazing!  *Folies Bergere was good to see, and it is ending its long run soon.  Jubilee is another good traditional show  *Bar at Times Square in NYNY is fun  *Secret Garden & Dolphin Habitat at Mirage is neat - and you can be Dolphin Trainer for a Day, which is cool  *Madamme Toussaud's wax museum was surprisingly good  *Loved the shopping at Venetian and Caesears  *Fountains at Bellagio are not to be missed|`|AA10240904	The ambiance of Vegas is wonderful 24/7.  You never have to gamble to have fun.  You can see lots of shows like one of the six Cirques or a celebrity or two.  You can eat and eat at buffets and very pricey, fancy restaurants.  You can go to the clubs and party hardy.  You can lay by the pool and enjoy the eye candy, male or female.  You can walk the Strip and enjoy the neon at night.  Where else can you see a pyramid or NYNY or a castle or a volcano or a pirate show or a water show for free.  And there is always shopping and more shopping.  Oh, and will you gamble you can enjoy "free" beverages including alcohol.      Vegas is the entertainment capital of the world for a reason.  There is something for every adult!|`|0a77fc4ea3cd11663c40afe098d312f9aa	Vegas is one of my favourite places to travel because you can find everything there. The whole day can be filled to the brim with shopping, sightseeing, eating, walking, show-seeing, relaxing, dancing, pubbing, and of course gambling at the highest quality there is. What other city can boast that? I was in awe the very first time I went and was able to experience all of that.|`|puyAEPZyaa	Depending on what you are feeling up to, here are my recommendations:    Eating - Wynn's Buffet, Bellagio's Buffet, Nine Steakhouse at Palms, or MIX at Mandalay Bay    Dessert - The Pastry Shop or the Crepe Shop at Paris, the Chocolate Shop at Wynn, the Chocolate Shop at Bellagio, or the Chocolate Shop at Caesars Palace    Shopping - Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, Grand Canal Shoppes at Venetian, and Fashion Show Mall    Shows - Cirque du Soleil "O" at Bellagio, Cirque du Soleil "Believe" at Luxor, or Blue Man Group at Venetian    Clubs: PURE at Caesars Palace, Rain or the Ghostbar at Palms, and Tao at Venetian    Other things - Madame Tussauds Wax Museum at Venetian, the Coke and M&M Stores, and the n

There prices are for 2 people.  We've stayed at the Alden down in St. Pete Beach. Very nice. They don't charge for an extra person. It was a family type resort. It's on the beach. It has 2 pools, volleyball court, bar on the beach, hot tub.  They didn't have a restaurant in the hotel, but there are several restaurants in the area. Including Crabby Bills!

NWopkX4baa	The National Gallery cafeteria has a wonderful view and decent priced food. It's a great place to eat.|`|sgclB6v9aa	the Milestones by Parliament Hill has a great location.      Also, you can try some restaurants on Spark St.  An Irish restaurant there is very close to the cenotaph if you're in the mood for heavy winter food.      Restaurants in the Market are nice too, they may not have a view of parliament, but the Blue Cactus has great big windows so you can watch passersby and see the downtown lights.      for something more quaint, try Memories, a small diner with interesting soups, salads, quasadillas, quiches etc.  awesome desserts and beautiful location and atmosphere!  on Sussex aaaand York (*i think).  by the american embassy.     Pizzaza in Hull just across the bridge is great too (yes, Hull can be nice!)  it's all pizza, but very classy and little up-scale.  still very cheap (i could afford it on a student's budget,..$10-$12 a pizza maybe).    Enjoy!|`|Ayn7tpXKaa	You could try the revolving restaurant.  I think it's @ the Marriott hotel.    The Chateau Laurier is great, too.

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Realize that many Las Vegas hotels require a two night minimum on weekends. That is their busiest time of the week (and the most expensive).     If it is a business trip fly and deduct the cost from your 2009 income tax. If it's more for pleasure drive. It's about 5 hours each way, and you'll have your car there to enjoy some of the local areas that tourists don't usually see.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Drive. It is only 4-5 hours. And then you don't need to rent a car once you get to LA.    And with all the airport hassles and security, driving only takes about an hour more than flying and you are not a slave to an airline schedule if you drive.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	Really depends where you are starting in LA...  Both driving & flying (once you factor in the hurry up and wait part of flying) will take the same amount of time.  Sometimes there are traffic jams that make it take longer & sometimes there are flight delays.    There is road construction between Baker & the Stateline and some days/times the road is closed right now.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	I would fly.

If there is a winter storm coming in, you might get blocked at Cajon Summit. On the other hand, you can sometimes see some beautiful wildflowers on the way, so driving is worth it.    If the company is paying for it, just fly.|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	flying is always fun|`|ce3d72b6ed7c1ac4edb6ba4e87690490aa	It depends on the price of gasoline and the price of a airline ticket.  But driving is fun because you get to see the desert landscape and you also will have a car once to you are there. But flying is fun too because you get there in 45 minutes and you won't have to deal with traffic coming or going.
7HKTDcvYaa	Everywhere you go the public is clamoring to have walking trails, bike paths etc instead of only auto roads. Well we often get what we ask for. Then someone else clamours for reopening  as a road. If local government gives in to this request, local citizens will soon be barricading it.     If you can demonstrate that the trail is not being used by hikers and bikers, then you have a chance to get it returned to vehicle use. But don't count on it staying that way for long.|`|j3y7Liamaa	and it's not like it being an unfinished road really matters, the point that it's such a short way to Lonsdale and such instead of going all the way down to the highway and taking that route, I think it's ridiculous.

One best place in Costa Rica is the Corcovado National Park on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. It offers in the region the largest tropical rain forest. On the other hand, Arenal Volcano and Lake Arenal is the largest lake of Costa Rica and a water sports is abound here. If youre looking for a romantic getaway then you can take a horseback ride with your partner. Arenal Volcano is a famous attraction and there is available fine lodging which accommodates you well.|`|GTZFpbfPaa	if you are looking to get away see the beaches and surf i would recommend tamarindo.it is in the province of guanacaste and if you are not strong in spanish there are ALOT of english speaking tourists and locals so you wont need to worry about that. it is a big tourist town with shops and food and really cheap surf lessons. the water is nice and clean and warm!
ada347c9f8c191ef5503d5f59e329442aa	That's sweet.    You can usually find a selection of framed plaques and other giftware at Islamic bookstores. There's a place called "Islamic Books" on Gerrard St (between Coxwell and Greenwood) which probably has what you're looking for. If you're in the West end though, try "Amira Islamic Fashion & Book Store". Here's their website: http://www.islamcan.com/amirafashion    If you haven't already, check out your local mosque as well. Some of the larger ones have stores either inside the mosque or somewhere in the vicinity.     I also came across this list: http://www.torontomuslims.com/directory/...  It's not the best organized, but it may be worthwhile to have a look at.     Hope this helps.

HwujORd2aa	That's great that you're concerned.  It's a really tough economy right now as you know, so jobs can be tough.  Both careers are universal-they're everywhere, so yes there are both there.  You can help them by looking up jobs in construction on Monster.com and google nursing schools in Columbia, SC.   I'm sure they wouldn't make the move without being financially ready to do it, and prepared for a long time finding work.  If you are concerned about their finances, just ask if they're ready for it financially if work can't be found for up to a year.  My guess is, they will tell you yes.  It's also a very mature question for you to ask.    Columbia has grown a lot in the last 10 years.  Hopefully its not hit as hard by this recession as other places.  The Chamber of Commerce can tell you unemployment numbers in that area too.   Good luck.

AA11523701	Winter is actually a great time to be at the park and the cabins are a very cool place to stay.    It is true that the South Rim is up at 7,000 feet elevation and so they have a real winter with sub-freezing temperatures and snow storms.  That being said, northern Arizona weather is unpredictable and while a snow storm is possible, three out of four days are mostly clear - so there is definitely no guarantee that it will be snowing.  However, there will likely be snow and ice on the ground from previous storms and it will definitely be cold - especially at night, so be prepared.    Unless a storm actually does hit, than I would say go for a hike... the first mile or so of the trails may be icy, but it is often OK (if a bit muddy) after that.  I would highly recommend getting a pair of yak-traks (metal and rubber treds that you can stretch over your boots) and trekking poles are not a bad idea.  Any of the three major South Rim day hike trails (South Kaibab, Bright Angel or Hermit) would be good.  I would avoid any winter hiking on Grandview as it has some places near the top that are scary enough without ice.  As with any canyon hiking, don't try to go to the bottom and back in a day and remember it takes more time and effort going up than down.    Other things to do... check out the geology exhibit at Yavapai Point, the free art exhibits at the old Kolb Studio (near your cabins) and see if there are any ranger talks at the Shrine of Ages.  Even though you are staying at the cabins, be sure to go check out the lobby of the grand 1905 El Tovar hotel - they will likely have a nice fire going in the big fireplace.      Have fun... this is a nice time to visit.  There are very few crowds and the canyon looks extra pretty with a little snow.  Just dress warm and make sure your care is ready (tires and anti-freeze).

NNTfENpjaa	OK, I am really disappointed in 2 of the comments especially knowing that one of them came from a Colombian girl.  Bogota is a capital city.  All capital cities everywhere follow the same lines, lots to do, over crowded, traffic, bars and clubs, culture, and work.  Bogota is no different.  If you are going to Colombia for the women firstly the hottest ones are in Medellin, ask any Colombian or any one who has been here and knows about my country.    Secondly most of girls are really nice, however some are very shallow and believe that going to America and leaving the "dream life" is a realistic possibility if they can find an American guy and convince him to marry her for long enough to get a visa (this is however a very small percent here in Colombia, bar the girl who commented above most of us love our country).    Thirdly you need to speak Spanish to really enjoy it and especially if you want to go out and meet people.    Lastly ignore the people that said you will get kidnapped for being a tourist, anyone who has an ounce of intelligence knows to stay clear of the problem areas (basic the jungles and tiny towns).  In the cities you are just as safe as you would be in any other city in any other country.    If you still need advice or have more questions just go to my profile and send me a message.    suerte!|`|p1n1ViwIaa	travel guide of Colombia:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHpDpGAG2...|`|YRSvhWfVaa	Bogota is a sweet place, don't go for the clubs go for the envrioment.|`|AA11334468	Don't go to Colombia  Unless you want to be kidnapped by F.A.R.C.|`|gRW5X4vZaa	1) Are you an idiot?  2) This is really weird because half my family is from Bogota and the other half from Medellin.  3) So.... back to the original point.

If you want a companion to not be alone, learn spanish and go to any "disco" and ask any of the beautiful ladies who are dancing with three other women to dance.    I have lived in Colombia almost 8 years. The last 3 I have lived in Bogota.

Here's a quick hint, though:  The value of homes as you describe will vary greatly depending on where in the Denver area you put them..............|`|0d811LEXaa	Personally I think housing is expensive in Denver.     Well it all depends on the area but when you think about it, all your home is, is a place to store your stuff and sleep.  You spend just as much time at your job to pay for that place.    I have a 4 bedroom house (Mobil) which I rent out for 600 a month and live in a 3 bedroom house and pay 800 a month to own buy. The 4 bed is owned clear so technically I pay 200 a month for my new home, cant beat that.  But still pay the 800 plus the 6 for my other home so I'll have mine paid off in 6 more years.      Those apartments sound beautiful though, especially the 5 bed room with the 400 foot balcony. I think the rent on some apartments are way to high, I would rather buy  because I know your 5 bed is going to be what about 1200 to 1500 a month?  Sorry I have never really rented, but for that price I'll buy instead.  May not be as big as that but it would be mine.    Good luck in renting your places.
kbYjkh45aa	I will always remember one time that I was heading home from my shift- I saw a red corvette sidelined on the road so  I pulled over to help.  Turns out that it was "Bubble Nicolas" and the "Living Statue" girl- french street performers that had a show at the Epcot's France pavilion.  They were heading to the airport to catch a plane back home and ran out of gas. After taking a couple trips to get the gas for them, they asked for a short-cut to get to the airport.  I went ahead and escorted them all the way to the airport.    Three weeks later, I got a post-card and a gift package from overseas, thanking me for helping them get to the airport on time.  I still have the postcard and the memory- one of many...|`|rSq790ksaa	That sounds like a great idea for a book, I would definitley read that.

We get all the Canadians in shorts calling us Floridians in winter jackets crazy.  The feeling is mutual!  When the ride is quiet, we let the guests just stay on the ride.  Our record is 47 times in a row without getting off.  I wasn't there for it.. but I had a family of 11 who went around 11 times.  Now, the rafts at Kali have 12 seats and every time they went back around, the insisted that I ride with them.  I could have, but it was cold and the sun was going down!  Even they were shivering.  Finally, after that 11th time, they got off, but before they left, every single one of them gave me a big wet hug!  I went home freezing that night, but with the biggest grin ever.    Working there was great because we could really play with the guests.  When someone asked "Do you get wet on this ride?" my answer is always "Only on Mondays" (or whatever day it had happened to be).  Or if they were putting on ponchos in the line, it would be "Sorry, Ma'am, no ponchos are allowed between 1 and 3 in the afternoons".  I was always kidding of course, and they knew it, but some played along.  My favorite was, when we weren't busy and people wearing ponchos asked if they could go around again, I'd say yes, but only if they took off the ponchos.  9 times out of 10 they would!!    I also worked at Kilimanjaro Safari.  The breakroom there has a wall of Disney movies that we would watch constantly on breaks and such.  The Lion King, A Goofy Movie, Aladdin, George of the Jungle, etc etc... and Cast Away?  Yes, we had Cast Away, that boring, depressing Tom Hanks movie.  Why on earth did we watch Cast Away, you ask??  Because Wilson is in it!!!!  If you've ridden Safari, you know about Wilson Mutua, our "airborn warden" on the radio...      My husband still works at Old Key West and Saratoga Springs resort and has some great stories there, too.  He saw Ben Rothlesburger (spelling?) there today - he's staying at Saratoga Springs.

rljol7sjaa	Without knowing what you want the GPS for (driving, trail biking or hiking etc) I understand from a friend in CR who does a lot of tail biking, that the Garmin CR map is one that a few of his biking buddies use. However, keep in mind, they may be "somewhat" accurate in position (GPS) but not in direction if you know what I mean.     Driving in CR is a experience by itself. My friend informs me that it is not uncommon for the GPS to tell you to turn right, and the next thing you know you are heading the wrong way down a one-way street. Or it tells you, you are on a road/trail, where in fact you are standing in the middle of a stream. Road and trail conditions change what seems like daily, moreso when it rains. The recent earthquake made many detours that are and will not be programmed in the GPS. And there are many roads trails that are a must to take to get to point A to B that are also not programmed in the GPS.    If you are planning to use it for driving, you should be Okay, however if you are planning it for trail bike or hike, common sense tells you it is always best to get a local map and/or hire a guide.|`|OZWJi4Jgaa	Buenas dias Kapn,    Like many Costa Rica visitors and people that have made the move to Costa Rica, finding my way around the twisting, turning and unmarked Costa Rica roads was a daunting task.  Although I do enjoy many of the discoveries that come with making a wrong turn  getting from point A to point B in a timely manner can become a priority when the destination is a business appointment, a child needing to be picked up from school, etc.    In order to put away my marginally effective Costa Rica paper road map and car compass, I decided to purchase a GPS unit loaded with a comprehensive digital road map of Costa Rica.  I thought this would be easy to find given todays technology, but once again  everything Costa Rica takes research and time.  But I am happy to report success!  Here is what I ended up with:        *      GPS Unit:  Garmin Nuvi 360 (www.Garmin.com)      *      GPS Map: NavSat EzFind Costa Rica Map         Note: Garmin does not have or support any Costa Rica map at the time of this writing.  NavSat is a Costa Rica company that makes a great map compatible with many GPS devices.    I was pleased with the map installation service and knowledge provided by SATEC here in Costa Rica.  SATEC is an authorized Garmin and NavSat retailer with offices in Guadalupe, Curridabat, Tres Ros and Escaz.    Once loaded, the Garmin Nuvi 360 and NavSat EzFind Map worked extremely well together.  The EzFind Costa Rica map comes pre-loaded with extensive points of interest, stores, banks, ATM's, restaurants, hotels, bars, pharmacies, etc., etc., etc.  Perfect for any Costa Rica traveler or in-country driver.    The Garmin Nuvi 360 touch screen mapping feature is intuitive and easy to use.  Other than the occasional street that does not go through or the infrequent left turn that cannot be made because of right turn only restrictions, the Gamin GPS unit and EzFind map get you where you are going.  If you do stray off course, the GPS quickly recalculates on how to best get you back on track.    Important Note:  People come to Costa Rica to enjoy the rich culture and scenery.  Sticking to the main roads and staring at an electronic device while exploring Costa Rica is a "contradiccin en los objetivos" -or- 'contradiction in objectives'.     Turn-off the GPS and get lost - frequently!   You'll be glad you did ... while having the comfort of knowing when it's time to make that flight or dinner appointment you can touch the screen and be on your way.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	I've lived in SoCal all my life and never heard of any place called "The Music Business" in downtown LA. What kind of shows are you talking about? I'm really trying hard to think why you would even need to take an RV downtown.     I agree with the group consensus here. I think it's an extraordinarily bad idea. Like an alarm is going to help if you are doing a show in a club somewhere downtown. You won't hear a thing. Probably won't even hear the sirens of the fire engines that come when some punk sets your rig on fire. Yeah, I'd say that's a really bad idea.     I don't know where you live now, but I'm guessing you haven't been to downtown LA. This isn't downtown Bismarck. In fact, there are more people in five squre miles here than the entire state of North Dakota. I don't know where you are going to put on shows so late at night, but downtown LA isn't going to be the place for legit shows.

When I have family come into town, I always recommend this place and people really like it.

7toznquyaa	If you're asking about Drinking in a bar, then  NO, married or not, the drinking and gambling age is 18.     Of course if you are 17 you can go into a bar.. like Senor Frogs (which is really a restaurant) at any age, but you can't drink legally.    Being married has nothing to do with this law.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	Shelley is right. The minimum age to legally drink is 18|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Last time I was there, they had no age limit on drinking.

7toznquyaa	Bring lots of sunscreen and TONS of money.    At night, stay in the tourist areas, and stay with a group of friends.    For cheaper food and drink.. leave the premises and visit downtown Nassau and the Fish Fry or Potters Cay under the bridge.    Snorkeling at Atlantis is lame.  Take a one of the tours available.    Stuart cove has a shark snorkeling tour.(www.stuartcove.com)  well worth the time and money.    Forget about renting a scooter.. Roads in Nassau are dangerous and in disrepair.  Tourist end up in the emergency room on a regular basis.     Ferries and the Jitney are the best way to get around Nassau.  The  10 jitney from downtown will cost you $1.25 and take you along bay Street to Cable Beach.|`|oRRsRCPGaa	http://europesworld.info/|`|3On59BLLaa	if this is the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island/Nassau in the Bahamas, here's a link that should get you all the information you need  http://www.indianchieftravel.com/en/baha...    for more on the bahamas check this out  http://www.indianchieftravel.com/en/baha...|`|4dc6452c55b5dc84c7b577efad985516aa	The pools and water slides close at 7.

3buQDaRDaa	I'm not sure. Even if you get in, you are going to be paying about $44k plus your frosh and soph years, and when you are a junior and a senior $47k plus. Actually, after scholarships and grants it would be in the mid $20's to lower 30's, but that is still a lot of money a year    Because frosh admission is competitive, it would be best to go to another school and transfer into Michigan. Competition and standards for transfer students is reduced. I'd go to UIC (or another school) for two years (you'd be accepted and probably get a free ride to most school you apply to), and transfer to UM-Ann Arbor after my sophomore year. Regardless of what you do, you should contact admission people and people in the anthro department.     http://www.admissions.umich.edu/about/   http://www.admissions.umich.edu/transfer...    P.S. If you are currently a senior, unless you have already applied, you won't make it in because you missed the deadline for making into the the LSA school.|`|ZGUkizjYaa	To respond to the earlier answer, U of M does not take many transfer students:  they simply replace who leaves in the class, and if few people leave, they only take a few.    If your GPA is unweighted, you should be in.  Though I recommend taking the ACT, U of M likes it better, and a 28 or higher and you'll be in for sure.    Depending on where you are from, U of M may be more competitive.  Chances are that if you are from New York, U of M will require higher standards than Wyoming, as a result of the university's promotion of diversity.
AA11562326	Well, your mom considers you responsible enough to take care of yourself, and I'm guessing you are.    But if you're the only one in the house and lonely, see if you can stay over with a friend's family, or relative's for a few days at a time.  You should cook and clean or whatever normal chores you do while there, to be a good guest.    Or maybe invite your neighbor family over for dinner.    Homework should keep you busy for the rest of the time.|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	Dance around in your underwear and drink straight out of the milk carton!!

Each day, look up the port on the internet so when she gets home you will know more of what she is talking about and has pictures of.  It will also be a little like sharing the day with her.  Some of the cruise lines such as royal caribbean have a camera on the front of the ship and if you go to their site and pick the ship she is on, you will see a live picture from her ship.

If I was you I would wait until you are 18 though.|`|AA11984132	You will need more than a cheap ticket to Ireland. You will need accommodation, and a job or a place in college.

Good luck to you.|`|AA12022384	As an American you need an employment permit (green card) to take up employment in Ireland  Also the school leaving age here is 18 so even if you can get a permit, which costs 1,000  without any qualifications you would find it very difficult to get a job as Ireland like the rest of the world is in a recession.|`|afeoTehEaa	Sher you can always get a job as a potato picker.|`|I7D95moVaa	Ryan air    although the plane would fall apart mid flight    You do know it rains here dont you?    well good luck to you

RLCnQ6Ihaa	GPS is no doubt popular, and worthwhile to a point. Also, it can be distracting, and if you are advised of eg. an accident. you can sometimes be past the point of another exit, so it has pros and cons.   Personally I don't like the chatter of it.      We have Mapquest, and there are also CAA and AAA associations that are excellent advisers and provide road maps, if you are a member, but in North America if you have a membership for one, eg United States, it is honored in Canada also.|`|Vmt7ylcuaa	Good to bring both.

Relatively yes, but we must have an alternative|`|vcWuPlOyaa	A GPS|`|VSqk5zpnaa	Maps can't get you out of traffic jams or warn you of one. Maps can't redirect in under 10 seconds while a GPS does it instantly. Maps are huge. Gps's configure the shortest and quickest route to your destination. Maps take pre-planning. A gps has places of interests and hospitals and will show you the nearest gas station with the click of a button. Billions of reasons.

tQsxsuNPaa	What has any of that got to do with your eye color?     The blue eyed gene is dominant.  And it can skip a generation.  And if your Scottish-Irish-English ancestors had blue eyes, then you could have blue eyes.  Are you looking for some excuse to accuse your parents of adopting you and then keeping it from you?  I don't think that's enough to go on.    And, as there is no indication that your relatives from predominantly darker complexions are NOT blue-eyed, you have no reason to assume that the blue eyes didn't come from them, too.  Just because you think of a country as having all dark - eyed people, doesn't mean there is no such thing as a blue-eyed person from there.  Many blue-eyed people in Spain, and I'm sure, the other mentioned countries.|`|ef522zDaaa	well i could be genes  does ur mom or dad have blue eyes?  u could have gotten it from them.  i get my green eyes from my dad   my mom has blue eyes but shes irish and German so  it just is from ur parents has really nothing to do with nationality.|`|33b29bdd98f8d8d34167893336d47bfeaa	Blue eyes are found in all of those countries.

R5lJXhRhaa	When applying for a passport for the first time, you will need:  A completed passport application form (available at any U.S. Post Office)   Click here to see passport application fees   An official birth certificate with a raised seal (if you do not have an official birth certificate contact your state government to learn how to order one.)   A photo ID (driver's license would do)   Two official passport photos (these photos must meet federal specification and can be taken at the Post Office)   Instructions for submitting the application are on the form       link:http://www.eku.edu/academics/studyabroad...|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Go to Walgreen's or another pharmacy that takes appropriate size photos for a passport. These photos run around 8 or 9 dollars. Next go to the post office and fill out an application for a passport. You will need your original birth certificate and social security number and a money order or cash for the application to be processed. I believe it was a bit over $100.00 when we went 2 years ago. Depending on how many applications are in process at the time you apply, it will take between 6 and 12 weeks to get your papers and passport back in the mail.|`|bzbH2C1Aaa	by aplying for 1|`|dXs0A2xlaa	you go to a place where you know they take one, like a one hour photo store, and you ask for passport pictures. the people ask for your information then take your picture and you get your passport within 8 weeks, i believe.|`|n0w7gISyaa	You can get an application form for a passport for an adult or child from a post office.

3hZwuEdpaa	There are several nice places to visit in Asia. It would also be cheaper to fly out to one of those like Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Bali Indonesia, India, etc. You should be clear about the specific requirements or interest in a holiday i.e. beaches, monuments, culture, history, wildlife, etc. I would say India is the most appropriate for any kind of holiday.

hWsNrDNUaa	High schools in San Francisco usually start around 730 (for first period classes) and 830 (for second period classes).  Classes end around 330 in most cases.  It's different from school to school the exact start and end times.  It is most useful to call the specific school you are trying to find out the schedule for.  Colleges/universities don't go on a specific schedule and each start/end time depends on the students schedule.  The earliest class for colleges/universities in the area starts at 8 am and the latest end time is usually around 930-10 pm.  If you check out the sfusd website I'm pretty sure you could navigate through different schools and check out their schedules.  You could also find information on all the schools in the system (including elementary schools, middle schools, and charter schools)

IVSqQQzlaa	I've heard lots of French Canadians also say, "eh".  What's the big deal eh??|`|azypqsphaa	no it's stricly a British thing we got from our ancestors|`|UIhbK2xOaa	The English Canadian "eh" probably derives from the French word "hein", which is commonly used among French Canadians in roughly the same way, meaning "huh?" or "is that not so?".  In other words we could say that eh? comes from the French Canadians.    To people who say that not all Canadians say eh, of course it is not common in all regions, but it is very common in many areas. Some of us do sound like Bob and Doug but we are NOT dumb, thanks a lot and take off you hosers.|`|8G42oyydaa	For starters there is no English Canadian "eh". This is a cultural idiom restructed to certain areas of Canada.  We do not ALL speak the same "language" in Canada. As I am from British Columbia I do not use the same idioms as people from the maritime provinces do.     This is one more example of a Canadian myth, this I believe was created by a comedic spoof The Mackenzie Brothers. I have never seen the show by a lot of the misconceptions about Canada can be blamed on the morons who created this show.    "The Great White North" (originally known as "Kanadian Korner") was a panel show that played upon Canadian stereotypes. Bob and Doug, two dumb beer-swilling brothers wearing heavy winter clothing and toques, would comment on various elements of Canadian life and culture, frequently employing the interjection "Eh?" and derisively calling each other a "hoser."  Whatever a hoser is, I don't know.    I can also say I do not know a single person in Canada who resembles these two idiots.    In fact the only time I saw anyone even remotely close to this character stereotype was in Coeur d'Alene Idaho at a gas station.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	They the French would say "quoi" which means what|`|5IyfWajGaa	just to verify all of my cousins...4 then 7 second cousins live near prince rubert...and always always use "eh" in every sentence/phrase they say...ehh!!!|`|ulz4UX6eaa	It isn't used in french at all.  I am canadian, but i don't think I have ever said "eh" in my life.  It is used in Ontario a lot, but not in many other parts of Canada. I speak french as well and haven't come across anything used as a substitute either...i guess other than n'est pas - meaning isn't that right?|`|AA12212523	It isn't and there isn't a French word - the nearest French equivalent is "n'est-ce pas".|`|AA10982716	If a French Canadian was writing about an English Canadian saying "eh" (which does happen, not everyone uses it all the time but a lot say it sometimes), they would probably write either "eh" or "heh".    The closest French Canadian equivalent is "non?"|`|N0VlabPBaa	its "Hen"or "Hein" (nasal sound)|`|c06dc4d1e227f35f0b67179987536394aa	It's "hein".  Kind of a nasally "uhn".

Number is: 0207 98 98 98     There are also cheap fares from British Midlands (bmi) at the moment.. around 1600 SR (do the currency conversion online as the rate changes drastically every week) - The Saudi Riyal is pretty strong these days    My family is actually coming to visit  me here in London in abt a week or so thats y I know a lot about this. Unfortunately I know nothing about air fares to Yemen :(    But hope my answer helped and have a good flight :)|`|KJ41khlwaa	I don't know, but good question.  I would like to know myself.

When you go south from the Las Vegas strip, there are many houses over there. Usually they are model houses and the area code is 702. So it should be safe. Dont live in the downtown area because its more dark alleys at the night and that's where the old casinos reside, I have seen some old looking houses there, and its not worth living in downtown since its the older part of Las Vegas.

Mostly everyone drives so there is no fear about pick-pocketing unless you are a tourist. Since you will be attending UNLV, I would strongly advise you not to live near that area. UNLV is located on the not-so-nice part of town and there is a lot of reported crime in the neighborhoods near it. I would suggest you live on the other sides of town, like Henderson, Summerlin, or the southwest areas if you are worried about crime. However, if you do not have a car to get to and from school everyday, then your last resort would be living on school campus.|`|cxDf9Q9haa	Without a doubt  away from UNLV area. As a 9 year resident here with 4 daughters in there 20's I would not want my daughters living there but instead Summerlin. Summerlin you pay a little more but you will feel much safer (because you will be). Also if you live on a main street in Summerlin such as Flamingo or Tropicana you can get a city bus easily to UNLV.    Also do not believe in every sob story you hear while living here the scam artists are very good and convincing. Check out Indigo Bay and Adagio both complexes are nice also check out Camden properties that are on the west end of town.

Next point: Thai merchants /restauranteurs./ hotel keepers  speak English and do so very well.  Like their counterparts on Silk Street in Hanoi and the Pearl Market in Beijing,  they see a  direct link between speaking English and making money.      Sure you will have problems communicating with people far from the major cities and perhaps even the "man in the street" anywhere but that is what gestures are for .

Not knowing how to speak, read and write Japanese at a native level will be a problem. You need a four year degree to work in Japan. And these jobs will always go to a native Japanese first. Staying in Japan the rest of your life won't be easy. You have to find a company there that would hire you. There are already many Japanese that can fill these jobs.This question has been asked many times before.|`|VvsnHi5Uaa	i think as long as they are covered you'll be fine|`|zHjq5Rg9aa	Having a tattoo will not prevent you from having a career in video games in Japan. What you describe is a small tattoo that would be covered at all times. I say this not because the tattoo would need to be covered at all times, but because of the cultural dress code, you wouldn't wear anything that showed your shoulders at work because it isn't culturally acceptable.     If you have numerous tattoos, you may not be able to enter an onsen, which is a public hot spring. Since everyone must bathe and then enter the same hot spring, it is an issue of keeping things hygienic for every-ones use.     I live in Japan and have a tattoo of a butterfly on the inside of my left leg right above the ankle. I often enter onsens with no problem because of the smallness of the tattoo and location.  If I had a eagle swooping down across my back there would be some problems!   Also because of the butterfly's placement, I don't have to worry about it being in the public eye.|`|8fb9d98c6d80fafbf9c4639d675c3af9aa	As many others have said, I don't think it will affect your career if you can even get your foot into that industry in the first place.     Many Japanese do have tattoos nowadays. So they're not that uncommon anymore. But there is still a social stigma with them.      The main problem you will have is getting into onsen, public baths, and waterparks. Many places changed their policy last year, and said people with tattoos are not allowed at all. No matter the size or placement.    Examples are Tokyo Summerland and Toshimaen. I live near them and went every year I've lived in Japan. But last year after the policy change we were no longer welcome. Even native Japanese with tattoos. That's the main problem with having tattoos here.

The almost inevitable answer is "yes, a little bit" and then they continue to speak very good english.    The fact is they can't abide people simply walking up and prattling on in english without paying them the complement of at least having a bit of a go in french. And that attitude is understandable, especially in Paris in June/July when the city is groaning under the weight of tourists, to the extent that the locals start to get a bit tetchy about being rudely approached by unthinking travellers. They see them as being rude and, worse, arrogant!

cfv2utFQaa	It is 1872 officially, but a little bit complicated story.   Check here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...    Okinawa was not an empire, please check the exact meaning of "empire" and "Kingdom" in east Asia.  Okinawa is a kingdom that contains greater Chinese imperialism system, from 15th century, but actually it was invaded by Satsuma, a load of south Kyusyu in Japan at early 17th century with Secret agreement of Tokugawa shogunate.     Although Okinawa, or Ryukyu at that time, was invented and have been dominated by Satsuma, a part of Japanese feudal system, Okinawan kingdom itself was leaved because Tokugawa shogunate don't want a clash of interest with great China.    (The mighty power of China have been enormous for thousands of years in east Asia. The stand point of Japan itself was very vague. It is very difficult to tell Japan is a part of Chinese Empire System or not, for very long time from 9 or 10 century to 19th century.)    We can say Meiji restoration in Japan in 1968 is an Declaration of Independence from China. At that time, Ryukyu (Okinawa) kingdom is publicly abolished by Japan in 1872 with other feudal load all over Japan (Haihan-Chiken 1871), and "the last king" in Okinawa became a n aristocrat of New Japanese Empire of Meiji.  It is called "Ryukyu-Shobun" (Okinawa issue) in Japanese history.    As a result of preservation of the national body in Okinawa, some Okinawan believed that they were still a part of China, not Japan at that days of absorption. They tried to make political maneuvering to be absorbed by China at that time after 30 years later of first opium war, and they failed.    Okinawan culture is very different from other part of Japan, but we can say its still "Japanese". Okinawan language in old days is hard to understand by other people in Japan, but it has completely Japanese grammar and they use Hiragana to write their language, although Okinawa was under stronger influence of China than Japan mainland in middle age.  Anyway, Okinawan people always have been "trained" as Japanese by Japanese government over a hundred years.    After the occupation by US troops, some Okinawan have awaken of their great days in the history of 15-16 century, and they started to educate their children as "Okinawan".  These days, many Okinawan people believe that they are Okinawan, and some of them even insist they are not "Japanese", originally. Many foreigners who studied about Okinawa a little believe it,  but it is a difference from point of view that whether Okinawa is a part of Japan originally or not. Or, I can say it is a difference of political belief.    I lived in Okinawa 2 years and I love Okinawa, but sometimes it makes me sad that many propaganda on Okinawa are even now from both left and right.|`|23vKOyBraa	"Overtook" is the keyword here I think. Incursions don't end at midnight on Dec 31st. And once overtaken, it can still take years to assimilate.    The long answer above doesn't really address the question. It is complicated as that answer says. I think you'll find the best answer will be "1872-1879" - the latter being the year it became Okinawa Prefecture - although obviously there was an overtake of the area many years prior to that..

Lake Tahoe, California and Yosemite National Park are two spots on the northeast part of California (directly east from San Francisco for about two hours) would be good honeymoon spots.  Mount Shasta in the extreme northern part of California (about two hours south from the California/Oregon border) as well as Lake Shasta would be good honeymoon spots.  Casa de Fruita in the foothills of California (about a two hour drive southwest of Modesto, California) just outside the bay area would be a good honeymoon spot.

VxfyQZ2jaa	Actually, bicentennial means 200 years, so the bicentennial of the American Revolution (1776) was in 1976.  Centennial means 100, so you might want to verify which one is required.    Your question is posted in the New Orleans section, and Jude is correct that Mardi Gras pre-dates the founding of the city by hundreds of years.    If you are asking about Mardi Gras in NOLA, there is not a single answer.    The first Mardi Gras celebrated close to the site that became New Orleans was in 1699. However, the celebration was whatever the small group of French explorers did and certainly did not involve parades through the city streets (there was no city yet).        The modern Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans started n 1857, with the first parade by the Krewe of Comus.     http://blog.nola.com/mardi_gras_faq/2008...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistick_Kre...    So, if it's bicentennial then that will happen in 2057.  The centennial was in 1957.    Good luck!|`|AA10399476	its 100th anniversary was about 200+ years ago ..        lol.. no joke    the 1st 100 years was  celebrated off and on  around the early 1700s    it became an official celebration in the early 1800s and floats came into the picture by the mid 1800s    and *bi* means 2  ..  not 1|`|zgDQrI2uaa	Oh dear, hon, bicentennial means 200.  Technically Mardi Gras has been around for as long as the Catholic church established Lent, which was over 500 years ago.  Mardi means Tuesday and Gras means fat in French.      Mardi Gras traditionally is the last day a practicing Catholic can eat meat until Easter.  Things have lightened up a bit and Catholics just give up meat on Fridays during Lent.  That's why there is so much celebration on Mardi Gras; people have to give up or sacrifice something they enjoy during Lent, so it is sort of a way of getting the last bit of fun in before Ash Wednesday.    The day after Mardi Gras is Ash Wednesday.  Catholics go to church and have a cross of ashes placed on their foreheads to remind them that they are human and will one day have to meet their maker.  It is also supposed to remind Catholics of the sacrifice Christ made on the cross.      In New Orleans, as well as most of southern Louisiana, the Lent season is taken seriously.  Most restaurants will offer Lenten dishes on Fridays with seafood instead of meat, and most people will talk of what they gave up for Lent.  Children usually will give up candy or coke while the adults will often choose a favorite food or make an effort to give up something they enjoy doing.      Good luck on your report!
