20090219225513AAoxO91	Computers & Internet;Software	Help putting videos into Powerpoint (2007) presentation?	Hello. I've been to so many blogs about this thing and am still confused. I'm trying to put Youtube and Dailymotion videos into a Powerpoint presentation. I will not have a live internet connection during the presentation. I'd like to be able to pause, rewind, and fastforward the videos but I'm not sure if that's an option if you've put the video in from your hard drive (as oppposed to embedding it directly from Youtube etc., which is what you do when you have a live internet connection during the presentation)   I've gotten as far as accessing Media Converter, but I have no idea:   *What format to convert a given video to.   *What to set bit rate/resolution and other video quality settings to when I'm converting the video.   *Where the heck the video gets saved to once it's converted.   *Whether or not I'll be able to pause and rewind the video when it's in the presentation.      Basically, I'm looking for someone who really knows their way around Powerpoint 2007 and understands the complicated and tedious steps involved in embedding videos from offline and finding a program that'll let me pause (etc.) the video during the presentation.

I don't like power outages and generally when they happen I'm doing something real important and I lose irreplaceable data.       If I need a UPS supply, what should i look for in terms of minutes, VA (volt amps) and wattage? if a 700 watt computer is on a 900 watt UPS, long long do I have before the UPS dies?      When I look for UPS systems locally it seems that's just one brand. Not just in one store, but 3-5 other local major computer electronics stores too.       and what's the difference of a UPS that's like $500 and a bank of deep cycle batteries, large inverter and a surge cord for the same $500 (I figure the battery bank I would get something like 60 amp-hours of power)?      -thanks

He is away and his room is locked. The router and main computer is in his room. I am using utorrent and recently i see that on the status on utorrent is not connectible (red) or no incoming connections (yellow) I do not have the firewall on and i do not know what kind of router he has. I tried randomizing the ports but it still doesn't work. I can still get a connection but the download speed has dropped from 500's kbps to about 23 and jumping to about 130 it just jumps up and down. I close utorrent and open it back up and the staus will be yellow (no incoming connections). I have looked into port forwarding but since i am not able to see the model of router i cant check port options. I have been downloading torrents for about 7 months now and have never had ANY type of problem like this. The only time i noticed that there was some type of problem was when we would use alot of bandwidth. Hmmm So im stuck. I took my Laptop to another friends house and noticed the same problem. Same not connectible status. So it cant be the router. The only thing i have not tried is deleting the torrents and reinstalling the app. Most of the torrents i have downloaded are at least 50% or more. Any help would be much appreciated!!

20090220004033AANqWRK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Is there a way to permanently assign an external hard drive a letter so it won't randomly change on startup?	It seems like my external hard drive will just randomly change letters on me even though I do not add any more drives or anything. This causes huge problems when I run programs off it and have to go through and manually reassign everything to the new letter of the drive every time it changes. For example, I will put my entire music file into itunes under the I: drive, then shut down and when i turn back up, the hard drive now says it is J: drive and my music has to be completely rerouted the "J:" drive. I run windows Vista ultimate (32 bit) if it makes any difference.
20090220004336AAesZGx	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How to selectively delete custom dictionary in word 2003 without deleting the CUSTOM.DOT (default).?	Hi,    I am a medical transcriptionist and I need US dictionary as well as medical dictionaries of different specialties.  To make my work easy I thought it would be apt to add the medical dictionaries i.e medical, surgical, eye, ENT and many other specialty custom dictionaries and I ended up adding 15 of them.  Right now, I have 16 of them including US English dictionary, which is CUSTOM.DIC (default).  Now since in word one can only use maximum 10 dictionaries, I want to keep only the most important 10 dictionaries including  CUSTOM.DIC (default).  My problem is that I am not able to select only the medical dictionaries to delete as when I do this the CUSTOM.DIC (default) also gets selected.  I do not wish to give it a try and hit the delete button fearing that the CUSTOM.DIC (default) also might get deleted which i do not wish to do. Please guide me stepwise!!!

In the past month or so, I have not been able to burn cd's.  I burned them just fine up until now, and I can't for the life of me figure out what the problem is.  I've checked every site imaginable for a solution, but I have yet to find one.  I use Windows Media Player 10 and Roxio Creator LE to burn my cd's/dvds.  When I close Roxio, I get an application error that says "The instruction at 0x003621b1 referenced memory at 0x12963a14.  The memory could not be 'written'".  Does this make sense to anyone?  Does anyone have a solution, or know where I find one?

20060908221601AA2HGxm	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	For those of you experienced in backing-up on Win XP Pro laptops....?	I have always through the years just kept my program discs, and backed up the critical files to a second hard drive, or CD's/DVD's, knowing that I'd decrease the chance of any corruption of my files if they were always kept in their orgional format.      I once tried Nero's backup utility, and on unpacking one day, it decided to 'miss out' some files, and hence that data was then lost forever. So I've not tried any backup utilities since. I'm aware win xp pro has such a thing, though I've never tried it. Has anyone else?      I guess the holy grail of backups is one that takes care of a corrupted computer automatically, say from a second hard disk, but as I'm on a laptop, with only one internal HD (and internal CD RW/DVD ROM), and also with an external dual layer DVD RW, what can you guys (and gals, oops) reccommend as a fool-proof and safe way of backing up my laptop?      Surely I can't be the only one here to fear using these utilities?

I have 3 ram slots, I have one 1gb stick of ddr ram and two sticks of 512mb ddr ram, my computer works when i put the 1gb stick and one 512mb stick in, it says i have 1.50gb. but when i try to add the last stick of 512mb my computer does not boot up.      I installed a program called sisoft to check out my motherboard to see the max amount of ram that can be installed and it says 2gb, I also have tried adding one 256mb of ddr along with the 1gb stick and one 512..but still will not boot up.   does anyone know whats wrong? =(      I am sure every stick i have works tried each one individualy.      The 1gb stick is dobule sided DIMM.   One of the 512 sticks is also double sided DIMM.   The last 512 stick is single sided DIMM.      But the computer boots with either of the 512mb sticks along with the 1gb stick.

20090203113701AA6Yj8t	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++ Programming Question?	For school I'm trying to write a program that sells comic books. After prompting the user for his/her name, I am supposed to ask whether or not the user is liked by the owner. If the answer is yes a comic is recommended from a list featuring 6 other comics. If no, its a different stack. The user is then asked if he wants another. If no, the program terminates. But if yes, it goes and chooses a different one from the list, and can keep going until the list is exhausted. At the end the program shows what the user bought. My question is how do I make the program choose a different comic from the list, and also, how does it know to choose from the good stack or the bad stack? And how do I show the user what he bought at the end?

I will be randomly disconnected from my internet, and when i unplug and plug back in the adapter to solve it, it wont reconnect.  I will usually wait a couple hours until finally it randomly connects again without me doing anything.  Does anyone have a similar problem?  What can possibly be wrong and how do i fix it?        btw. if i try to click repair when i cant connect, it says ip address cannot be resolved.

20081109033230AAni5oZ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My laptop isn't working. Any help?	My laptop is approx 1 year old. It uses windows vista.      Recently it started running slowly and poorly despite nothing being found using a virus scan with AVG free. My friend told me that AVG wasn't a great anti-virus and i should get another. I tried to get another but then all hell broke loose. I downloaded 'Antivirus 2009' which i had heard was good but it didn't like it at all and i found out after downloading it wasn't free. I tried to remove it but couldn't. I saw that there is a free 'Spyware Doctor' or something similar that can remove things like Antivirus 2009 so i got that but it didn't seem to be doing much. I kept getting warning signals from Antivirus 2009 but it wouldnt do anything to solve it without payment/activation. I tried to solve the problem by disabling Antivirus 2009 and illegally (shh) downloading Norton 360 but before i got the chance my laptop just stopped working. It now wont work at all. I turn it on and it logs on but it crashes anywhere between instantly and 3/4minutes later. Ctrl + Alt + Delete doesn't work once it's frozen. Is there anything i can do? Should i take it to a PC repair shop?

20081111033004AArjUvN	Computers & Internet;Software	What can be done to solve this ever growing computer problem i created?	Basically had a PC running XP home. Restored back to factory settings (stupid girl). Couldn't get hold of a disc but got XP Pro. Installed it. It asked about D and C partion and Recovery, (Im assuming thats the C and D Drive). I selected D and it installed it saying all my files would be deleted. I wasn't too fused about that, but now when i go on the PC it keeps telling me i don't have enough memory or something. The fact that the PC still works is pretty good and i think i would like to continue learning from it. (As i have a laptop to use). Can someone explain to me (in basic terms) what exactly has gone on here and are my old files gone forever, is the PC about to die, or is there a way i can turn this all around, make the PC better and learn something new.      P.S When i installed it said it needed 1278MB (approx.) and I had 3869MB (approx.) So why does it say there is not enough memory on D. I have installed Security and FF3 nothing else is on the PC as far as i am aware unless my files are still there and i can get to them some how.       Hope this all makes sense   And thanks in advance.
