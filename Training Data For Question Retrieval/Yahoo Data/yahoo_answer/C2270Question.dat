20090128191635AAnVGe3	Games & Recreation;Board Games	How do I end a turn in The Game of Life: Twist & Turns?	I was trying to play this game, when I inserted the first VISA card it was okay, I pressed spin, got a number, moved that number of spaces and got the salary, but then I took it out of the LIFEpod. I inserted the second VISA card on the LIFEpod, and I had the same money as the first card, and it all was exactly the same. I tried with the third too, and it all seemed like the game didn't recognize me switching turns.   I'm not sure of how to insert the VISA card, either. I insert it directly, but I'm not so sure if it is like that.   Is there a way to end a turn?   How do I insert the card correctly?   Is there a way I can solve my problem? If so, what is it?   Is there a button that is for ending turns?

I have a gamercard, but lets just say i only have the PC version of the game my brother has for 360 and i still want to play him. how does that gamercard come into play for the PC user, if it does at all? FINALLY, my last question is how would i get started? i went to www.gamesforwindows.com/live and hit the join now, and then typed in email and password, but i dont know where to go from there.

20090128183312AAGT1jA	Games & Recreation;Gambling	Why do people value play money chips on Poker Sites?	I understand the concept that, if you want to learn poker, or just want to enjoy it without the risk of losing money, play money poker is the way to go.      What I don't understand is why people often ask for chips from other players, why people would consider buying them, or why people play "all-in every hand" style poker just to accumulate a huge stack.      I can't see any reason why playing 10,000/20,000 no-limit would be any more rewarding than 1/2 no-limit, when the chips aren't redeemable for money.  And, since you can always get free chips from the site, why does it hurt to lose your precious stack of 15 million chips and start again with 1,000?      The worst consequence of this strange obsession, as I can see it, is that this kills any learning value in playing poker for fake money.  It seems people will do anything to get more chips... anything except play sensible poker, that is!        Can anything be learned about the game by begging chips off of strangers, or plunging your whole stack into the pot with a 48 offsuit after a flop of KKQ double suited, especially with the full knowledge that half the table intends to call you?      Can someone please enlighten me to this strange phenomenon?

I stole alot of stuff but made sure no one saw me doing it... so i dont get it. What is the point of stealing if i always have to go to jail and wither away my skills? Can someone help me out?

20090128194452AA51eQt	Games & Recreation;Card Games	Is this deck antiteledad and any tips will help.?	i think i finally gotten the right cards together, this deck should not only be able to take down teledad decks, but other decks, zombies,glads etc.i'll post the list first and then the stratagy, feel free to comment and help.      Thunder king Rai X2   D.D Crow X2   Breaker the magicial warrior   Kycoo the ghost destroyer X3   sangan   spirit reaper   Mystic tomato    Krebons X3 (yes, krebons)      Tribute Monsters   Caius the shadow monarch   Dark General Freed X2   D-Hero Plasma   Dark Red EnchanterX2      Spells   Allure of Darkness   Book of moon X2   Emergency Teleport X2   Brain controller   Monster reborn   heavy storm   fires of doomsday X2   scapegoat   dark core X3      Traps   Threathening roar X2   Torrential tribute   Sakuretsu armor X2   Dimentional prison X3         Thunder king Rai-  trick here is to get him out quickly and negate malicious, dad or other monsters that can be special summoned, the down side is its effect being used on you, so be careful and plan when to play.      d.d crow and sangan are hand in hand, get d.d crow from sangans effect to remove malicious and even screw up your opponents graveyard so they can't summon dad      Breaker the magicial warrior- its pretty self explanatory, best used on those set solemn judgments, a teledad deck only utalizes 2 or 3 basic traps, either solemn judgment, crush card virus (ouch) or threathening roar.      Kycoo- a must, just like d.d crow it screws your opponents chance with dad and prevent's malicious from being removed, really great card.      spirit reaper- just in there to incase you run out of cards and your field is empty, also used as a dummy card for allure of darkness.      Krebons- just because your opponent can synchro summon dosen't mean you can't, use krebons when you need them though, you may want to keep those kycoos etc on the field for a while, most of the time you will end up synchro summoning goyo guardian and sometimes a lv 8.      Caius is used to remove your opponents monster, spell or traps, that leaves them open sometimes, take down powerful monsters and deal 1000 damage to them and sometimes leave them for a direct attack and end the game.      Freed, one of the best for this deck, you can negate any spells that target a dark monster, brain controll, smashing ground, book of moon, mind controll or lightning vortex, brain controll is the most popular.his second effect is what makes him shine, rather than conducting a draw phase, you can add 1 lv 4 or lower dark monster from your deck to your hand, depending on the situation you have numerous options, d.d crow, breaker, sangan, kycoo etc.      dark red enchanter- why, because of his effect, he gains 1 counter for each spell card activated, even yours. in a teledad deck the average player plays 15-18 spells, and because they use destiny draw and allure and reinforcment, you end up with alot of counters, which eventually allows DRE to gain 300 atk,so say you keep gettin counters you can boost its atk to way over 3000 and use his second effect to completely send all cards in your opponents hand to the graveyard,no way they can summon dad or malicious if you have kycoo etc on the field and hit them hard for those couple of turns.      plasma is also good, negates their effect monsters, so long synchros and dad, and you can take out one of their monsters and add its 1/2 its atk to ur monster so synchros can be taked down.      most of the spells are pretty self explanatory   fires of doomsday is used to shield you from attacks and even if u manage to pull those tokens at your main phase 2, you can use them to your advantage.   i put dark core in there because all you have to do is send i card form your hand to the graveyard to remove any face up monster ur opponent controlls, stardust dragon, goyo etc.    and the traps are scarce, dimentional prison helps alot, remove the attacking monster, they will sometimes heavystorm, or solemn it, so use that knowledge to ur advantage.      You can see where this deck is goint, there are cards that are ment to take down each of those cards in the teledad deck, they have to work together, thats the impossible part, this deck is ment to stop destiny draws, allure and malicious and special summoning, know ur cards don't screw your self up also, that can easily happen, tell me how i did.
