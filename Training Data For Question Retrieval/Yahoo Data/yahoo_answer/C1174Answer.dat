IQMbsrrHaa	i love this hairstyle!<br>  there are two ways to do this so try both because one might work better than the other depending on how your hair is:<br>  <br>  -after you get out of the shower straight iron your hair. then french braid it for best results (a regular braid is a good substitute). NOTE: Only do one braid because that's the best way to get these types of curls. Then light lightly dust the braid with hairspray and sleep in it. The next day, do your hair last - way after you get dressed and brush your teeth - after absolutley everything! then just take out the braid, flip your hair over and shake it out. If theres frizz just spray some hair spray in.<br>  <br>  Another good way to accomplish this look is this:<br>  - As soon as you step out of the shower, apply a scrunching or curling mouse into you hair. NOTE: Don't scrunch it - just run your fingers through your hair. Then take some flexible gel and spread it in your hands and runs your hands throught your hair. Again, french braid it (or, like i said before, a regular braid is a good substitute). And sleep in it. The next day, take it out last and shake it out.<br>  <br>  that was long but if you take the time to read it, it will be really helpful!|`|ZqeFBRqOaa	How old are you? You look really young, like really really young. Like 11.<br>  <br>  Anyways, you have two 'surfer girl' options.<br>  <br>  1.) Use a spiral 1 inch curler. Curl all of your hair. (don't forget to put on heat protectant before) Then take a brush and gently brush through it a bit. You'll get really cool waves. Then spray Tresemme curl enhancement spray on it. It's a hairspray specifically designed to make curls stay. AND TRUST ME IT WORKS. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  2.) When you get out of the shower towel dry your hair until it's damp dry (don't rub it will cause frizzies). If your hair gets ratty without combing it comb it first while it's wet then towel dry it to damp dry. Now put a decent amount of gel in your hands, rub them together and squeeze sections of your hair up with one hand on each side. This is scrunching. Scrunch your hair all over. After you're done spray a little bit of hair spray.And that's it. It should stay wet looking and wavy all day. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|GrCn2PIUaa	before you go to bed wet your hair and put a little gel in it. then braid it and sleep. when you wake up, the curl should hold. <br>  i'm not saying cut your hair, but less length does make it curlier. maybe layer it a little?|`|cgzKZvVZaa	wear it in braids the night before<br>  it looks pretty wavy in your pic|`|0CFwVlVDaa	Garnier Fructis Surf Styling Gel<br>  or <br>  get long layers|`|ab078aa37afed5ac6f78a6ac451905e0aa	Buy this product- Aquage Sea Salt, or SunSilk Beachy Waves with Sea Salt. =)<br>  <br>  Apply it after you take a shower, and play around with your hair, shake it around, etc.<br>  <br>  Your hair is pin straight, so you may want to use a bit of hairspray.

G1xnTzwBaa	I've never heard of a website doing that, and I think it'd be pretty impossible. They'd have to take in each picture individually and information about you and your habits (that may affect your skin or face) and it'd be a very difficult site to keep up. Because everyone ages differently so they can't just do the same thing to every single picture.<br>  <br>  However, I DO know that these things exist. I had it done once at the Museum of Science. They digitally edited your picture so you could see what you'd look like in 5, 10, 20, 30 etc. years. It was very cool; I don't blame you for looking for a site like this.

When this happens, it shows. Do you smile often, do you hold your head high? and do you act confident? Most important  of all do you act like a lady? If you answered no to any of these that is probably your biggest problem. Listen, everybody has something wrong with them, do some research, find out what style of cloths and colors look best on you. You can always dress to take away from your worst features. Most of all smile, hold your head high, and don't worry about If you are popular with the guys, if you can change these few things I promise everything will fall into place. <br>  BE CONFIDENT.

67de5f42c6efc7599689e5a85a25e971aa	well if you have a long sleeved shirt, and a short sleeved shirt you can combine them (short over long)<br>  it depends what clothes you have. you could layer, or add something to one of your regular outfits to make it look like a  totally new outfit. be creative. but dont do something like layer it too much or have too much colors or anything<br>  good luck!!!|`|1b182595ed7fed68b7cb95fb90af390eaa	Just wear the jeans with a plain shirt.|`|35460e97c4a98185be2a6b1139554bc6aa	Jeans wit a White Tee & some Nike's|`|541dc6b40d37fe1187cabcac3a75c98aaa	layers are always a good look<br>  can you cut or alter any of your existing clothes?|`|863560fc17c7fcbbaab51747c979346eaa	Just put something together.  If you really have a passion for "punk" or whatever, then you should be creative.

UL6QbL1taa	Well, ankle straps tend to shorten the leg line but if you're only going to be wearing them with jeans, than that is no problem. Both of them are fabulous but the first one had a thicker heel which means it's a little easier to balance on them. So really, its up to you.|`|8ac2467fb20f72d90ec2b114546eaf0daa	well, i wouldn't consider either of those stripper shoes really. they are just heels with a little bit of a platform. but, ya, i too have started wearing the true stripper heels all the time now. they really are totall, totally comfortable. i mean strippers wear them for 9 hours a night for a reason. i have 3 or 4 pairs of the pleaser brand you can get at zappos.com. they are a good price and seem to be good quality.
AA11682169	To some men, they could be. My hubby has a stiletto heel fetish, I have 6 pairs of 5" stilettos and one pair is a high heeled sandal that I wear in the summer when we go out.<br>  He enjoys them and I enjoy wearing them for him.|`|328d490344efe054bfeaef95e75fd74daa	I dont consider them to be. But then I dont use my clothes in any sexual context.<br>  There are people who preach that if you like high heel shoes or evening gowns or lingerie that you have a sexual fetish with them, but that is not true at all.|`|8ac2467fb20f72d90ec2b114546eaf0daa	depends on the person. i think just about every guy is into heels. i mean, i'm a woman and i get a little tingle when i see a girl wearing really high heels and i wear them a lot myself. so, i can easily see how guys can have a fetish over them. and what better fetish to have!? you get a guy that loves heels and you'll have new shoes every week!
KYRQNJtiaa	A dark, wine-colored red (or perhaps, just red highlights) would look really cool. See the link to the picture below.<br>  <br>  Also, according to an article I found (see the second link below), you should not color at home, but go to a professional because Asian hair is very difficult when it comes to taking color (at least, according to this article).|`|7CJQt1kEaa	You must surely dye your hair in black.Even if it is young or old you must use black because it makes you look awesome .Did you know-even a 80 year old looks like a teenage girl because she put dye to her hair.|`|8820d8a45e4d2db63e1e885ac0ae1d90aa	To safely color your hair at home, go no more than 2 shades lighter (or darker).

eEuRVtdOaa	I guess you have your answer with the answers already posted-- some people use more shampoo than conditioner and some use more conditioner than shampoo.  Personally, I use more conditioner.  I agree with the other answers that most people don't wash, rinse, and repeat.  That repeat thing is a marketing tactic to get you to use twice as much shampoo.|`|0d53d26719b2381996151418e3d1a1f3aa	why do you wash your hair twice? you really should only wash your hair 2-3 times a week-washing too much strips your hair of its natural oils...& I don't know about you, but I generally use more conditioner than shampoo...|`|9ac8fbd2d3b683945bf89386c666b32daa	I always wondered the same thing!! I will have to keep checking back and see if anyone can answer this question.|`|AA10211615	not really|`|z6oHzadMaa	Ok well for people with curly hair like me i use more condition becuase shampoo dries my hair out even more so i use tons of conditioner. In my opinion conditioner is way more important than shampoo!|`|c31f19719f11916f9286bff92369e1f2aa	Most people only wash once, no need to do it twice. I also find that I use my conditioner faster than shampoo.|`|jfRxnb60aa	well alot of people dont do that, so  then that way they will run out at the same time so its just convenunt|`|kRLG7Sc3aa	Maybe because even though you shampoo your hair twice, you use more conditioner than shampo.
b4f64caf471137b01ceadae6d62b2bb0aa	Yeah, I've been with Japanese girls (whose natural colour is also ALWAYS dark) who dyed their hair blonde, and it's so weird yet so attractive AND cute.<br>  <br>  It worked for them (and me seeing them), so I reckon (if it's for yourself) you should pluck up the courage and give it a try.  You'll love yourself for it, though may attract criticism from some narrow-minded people, but that should be expected:)))<br>  <br>  If it turns out that YOU don't like it, you can always dye it again using something else.<br>  <br>  PS  Wish you could send me a pic of 'before & after', that would be cool:)))|`|298befdd1b597d89fbe28ebacc2f3a47aa	I think highlights might be ok. Not a whole head of blond though, it would look wrong as it's so different to the natural colour.|`|4a8039c4fbbe9a239c52f61e88ca56c7aa	It works for me , go for it.|`|f39992682a1c66b6c793c1c948ec9b6faa	i think it'll look ok, as long as you dun go totally blond. but what's wrong with your current hair colour? bored? cut it!|`|e9cbfdcb55f14c4bf82fe3ab0103b129aa	No, no and no.|`|AA11155909	I don't think it would look too bad, depending on the girl. But would Islam allow them to do that?
90Pyc2weaa	try putting sprays on then it won't get greasy also you can get curling cream which makes it less frizzy and more curly..good luck!!!|`|9e1f0a8ee4636b15fe8987c6c6b60216aa	BioSilk, my hair is also really frizzy and I use biosilk oil everyday it really calms my hair and makes it easier to straighten|`|a1530e116573abb99a554346b59e8a9eaa	Silk Drops from FX Special Effects.<br>  <br>  You can get it at any Walgreens, CVS, etc. You'll love it!|`|KYRQNJtiaa	Aveda's Brilliant Pomade.<br>  <br>  If you have straight hair or straighten your hair, you'll want to use the anti-humectant pomade.<br>  <br>  If you have curly hair and want to keep the curls without the frizz, use the humectant pomade or Aveda's "be Curly Curl Control."<br>  <br>  See the links below (i swear by everything Aveda--works great, smells yummy, good for your hair and the environment).|`|ac6554469392e100f85a8b65bf175dceaa	john frida friz ease sirum

(And its NOT THAT BAD, a quick poke and then they thread the jewelry and your done!) ((((PS: Go to a piercing shop - not Claire's or anything like that- get pierced by someone who does it Everyday--not just once in a while))))<br>  My navel took a little over 6 months to fully heal and i took care of it EVERY DAY. I have several cartilage piercings and they took an average of 2-3 months to fully heal.<br>  As for your mom....thats tougher....show her your responsible enough to take care of your piercing by doing chores, asking her if she needs help around the house....etc...Try to make a "bet" or "deal" with her. For example: If I can clean the house for you once a week and take out the garbage or raise my grades (whatever you think she'll go for) can I get my piercing next month...?<br>  Something like that!<br>  Good Luck and Happy Piercing!|`|0314b7a167d34cf5ec12cf0dfe2d668eaa	Belly hurts more. Cartilage doesn't hurt any more than a regular ear piercing (but a louder crunch). Ew, and don't peirce yourself. You'll just get an infection which is gross. Beleive me, you don't want one. Cartilage peircings aren't such a big deal. Try asking your mom nicely and support your argument with facts. Try this website- I randomly looked it up and it looked informational.  Good luck!|`|62b3b0f9a44efc053c501fedf3e4370faa	Anything you do to your body in an unnatural way is not worthy.  Remember it is a generational fashion; but it will stay as a mark forever.

There are people who like hurting sessions.|`|AA11481997	if you HAVE to do it yourself, do the cartilage.  its really easy to mess up the belly ring.<br>  <br>  as far as how much they hurt, the cartilage hurts more when they put it in, but the pain goes away really quick.  the belly ring doesnt hurt as much right off the bat, but it keeps hurting longer.|`|AA12054929	OOH please do NOT whatever you do pierce yourself. My friend and i pierced our own belly buttons when we were younger and hers got VERY infected and the skin turned green. Please leave piercing to a professional.<br>  <br>  Cartilage piercings are more painful and take longer to heal. Also they carry more risk of infection. You do not mention your exact age, but needing parental consent is for a reason. You should do google and yahoo searches on piercings. Things to look for at the parlor and such. Print it and review it with your parents. Be responsible and they may allow you to get it done now. If not, you'll have the information and knowledge for when you're old enough to go get it done without a parent.<br>  <br>  Please make the right choice.|`|a8fad8df5c4692c5bf506415c29b04f8aa	i have 3 cartilage piercings. and a navel piercings.  In my opinion the cartiage piercings have always hurt more. you only need to be 16 to get them done byt the professionals (without your moms consent) in most states i beleive (its liek that here in california)<br>  <br>  <br>  since you are underage but i dont know what your age is you should alwyas frespect you mom even though its hard. ive been there trust me. but i bargained with my mom . I told her if i got good grades then she would take me to get my first cartilage piercings as a reward. she was skeptical she didnt wan tot go and see a whole bunch of peopel wiht tattoos and piercings allover but she actually struck up on nice conversation with the guy who would be piercings me (they are all reallynice no matter how intimidating they look lol)<br>  <br>  but you should never attempt to pierce yoruself. like i have been saying when you get an infection from piercig yoursefl(and there is a very high chnace you will. this is why there are professionals that do piercings) you wil even be in more trouble by your mom when she needs to take you to the doctors to get on anti biotics. <br>  <br>  if you pierce your navel you could hit a vein of the muscle and cause damage. it will most likely reject (your body literally pushing the jewelry out) since i assume you are still growming and you are shoving unsterilized needles and jewelry through the area. causing scaring (your navel being distorted) or keloids (over growth of scar tissue that can only be surgically removed)<br>  <br>  <br>  if you pierce your cartilage you will also most liekliy get an infection. the infection could travel in between the layers of the cartilage causing cartilage collapse (premanently distorting you ear) and as well as keloid, (youyou are at higher chance for gettign keliods with the piercing gun at the mall sune they only push the skin away, they dont make a clean cut through liek the needles so that the professionals use) <br>  <br>  do not ever pierce yourself. you dont know the proper sterliziation techniques. you mom would be very dissappointed and upset at you for doign it behind her back, you dont know the prope aftercare, you dont know you anatomy! if you navel or cartilage is suitable for the piercings.. the professionals will. if she doesnt let you then suck it up and wait a few years like everyone else does without risking harm to yourself by being to eager and piercing on your own....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Ear_Collapse" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Ear_Co...</a>|`|4d99334f60856f1567cf86a73219976aaa	If you aren't old enough, wait until you are.  You could very well change your mind by then and too late, you are already scarred because of something you did when you were young and stupid.  Yes they do scar, I have scars from when I had my belly button done.  Twice (first one ripped out).  Even more stupid would be to pierce yourself.  Good way to screw that one up.

Make sure the spa doesn't already include the gratuity in the service fee.  They do that a lot of the time!

That way they can get you the right bra for your body, and the right band and cup size for the brand of bra you like to wear.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and as far as I have ever been to them, the fittings are free and preformed by professional women that do not make you feel uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Remember though, if you get yourself measured at one store for one bra type, your size could be different for a different brand and style bra. Sucks that just like shoes, no one can get the bra sizes universal...|`|38a52321b2736bfedffcf55448d70c67aa	Try a bra specialty store.

Just give it time ~ my gawd, what is the rush?  <br>  If you have the money ~ get extensions.  But they are hard on your hair too.

Eating some of those foods you listed won't help your hair grow faster.|`|9tpGKMD4aa	Just die :) <br>  would fix the hair problem fast enough hun.|`|FABBaSHDaa	Your hair grows on average 1/2 inch per month! There is no way to speed up the process! I know I know....you probably still think there is a miracle product out there what will speed it up....but it wont! There are hair vitamins that will strengthen your hair but only the new hair that comes out of your head while taking them!!!Basically if you start taking them today any new hair that grows out from now until you  stop taking them will get the vitamins. <br>  <br>  Yes heat in general can damage your hair but will not slow down the growth of it at all!!!!<br>  <br>  Use professional shampoo and conditioner, only wash you hair when it totally needs it no more than every other day. Get it cut only every three months and only get about 1/4 to 1/2 cut off! Good Luck!

0d42525af90f48c625c5b5331cf88e92aa	penser a mettre des gants<br>  <br>  <br>  Le Henné, quand la peau devient théatre...  <br>  Le henné est une teinture employée depuis fort longtemps dans le monde arabe. Elle est recommandée par l'Islam. Le Prophète lui même se teignait la barbe. Le henné est obtenue à partir de petites feuilles séchées et pilées, provenant d'un arbrisseau, cultivé en Inde, Perse, Arabie, et en égypte.<br>  Il revête enfin une importance particulière au moment du mariage. La nuit qui précède le jour du mariage est dite "nuit du henné", au cours de laquelle une femme procède en chantant à l'application de la pate sur les mains et les pieds de la future mariée, comme symbole de fertilité et souhait de bonheur conjugal, car le henné amène la "baraka".<br>  <br>  Si un produit de beauté dépasse et de loin tous les artifices ce serait bien le Hénné. Peinture symbolique et fantasmatique, le hénné est l'alphabet par lequel les femmes expriment les non-dits , le desir et la terreur. Cette peinture flamboyante portée à même la peau meriterait un discours bien plus qualifié que le mien. Alors je m'effacerai devant des considérations plus terrestres..<br>  <br>  Comment appliquer le Hénné et pour quels type de cheveux? <br>  Application en 6 étapesdu henné.<br>  Le henné donne des reflets acajou aux cheveux blonds ou chatainstout en stimulant et fortifiant les cheveux ternes. <br>  Etape 1 <br>  Munissez vous de gants en plastique, un pinceau, un filmplastique, des pinces pour maintenir vos cheveux, et du papieraluminium.<br>  Etape 2 Mettez la poudre de henné avec un peu d'eau dans un bol,faites chauffer au bain marie et mélangez au fouet jusqu'à ce quevous obteniez une pate lisse et onctueuse.<br>  Etape 3 Mettez vos gants et à l'aide du pinceau appliquez la patede la racine vers la pointe des cheveux et cela raie par raie.<br>  Etape 4 Regroupez les pointes au sommet de la tête et fixez avecles pinces. Enveloppez votre tête avec le film plastique puis avecle papier aluminium.<br>  Etape 5 Laissez reposer pendant 20 mn ou 1 h selon la colorationque vous souhaitez avoir .<br>  Etape 6 Enlevez le papier et le plastique et lavez vos cheveuxavec un shampoing.Pour des reflets clairs mélangez le henné avec 1 jaune d'oeuf.<br>  <br>  Coloration naturelle Faire le choix d'une coloration naturelle c'est avant tout privilégier la nature et la santé de ses cheveux.A la différence des colorations chimiques, la coloration naturelle respecte le cheveu tout en lui donnant souplesse, brillance et vigueur. Toutefois ce type de coloration présente l'inconvénient majeur d'être éphémère. Quelques lavages suffiront à la faire dispara?tre.<br>  <br>  Les nouvelles tendances<br>  Les colorations naturelles les plus utilisées actuellement : la camomille, le noyer, l'indigo et le henné. Pour celles qui souhaitent s'éclaircir les cheveux: la camomille avivera les cheveux blonds ou bruns. A déconseiller pour les cheveux foncés.Pour celles qui souhaitent accentuer les reflets de cheveux foncés: le noyer est la couleur naturelle appropriée. Pour des reflets bruns, pensez à mélanger le noyer avec de l'indigo. Pour celles qui souhaitent obtenir une couleur légèrement orangée voir rouge pour les plus courageuses, une seule coloration: le henné. Connu pour sa couleur flamboyante, le henné assainit les cheveux gras, épaissit et resserre les écailles des cheveux fins. Pour obtenir des nuances marrons ou noires mélanger le henné et l'indigo.<br>  <br>  Pour conserver votre nouvelle couleur, appliquez un soin final, un masque capillaire ou un après-shampoing après la coloration. Le soin élimine les traces de colorants et fixe la couleur en refermant les écailles du cheveu. Un masque colorant est conseillé pour les cheveux fragiles. Pour les soins quotidiens, privilégiez les shampoings pour cheveux colorés. Pour celles qui partent au bord de la mer prendre unshampoing contenant des filtres solaires et ne pas oublier le bonnet (piscine). De fa?on générale la coloration est déconseillée pour les cheveux secs, fourchus, cassants ou gras.<br>  <br>  Coloration à la camomille:<br>  Ingrédients : 250 g de camomille sechée- Faites bouillir dans une casserole deux litres d'eau e tincorporer la camomille. Laissez macérer pendant dix minutes.- Laissez reposer hors du feu le mélange pendant dix minutes.- égouttez la camomille et conservez le liquide ainsi obtenu.<br>  Répandez-le sur des cheveux propres.- Répètez deux ou trois fois cette manipulation et ne rincez pas.- Laissez sècher naturellement ou à l'aide d'un sèche-cheveux. Lescheveux deviendront plus clairs petit à petit. La coloration à la camomille est conseillé pour les personnes ayant des cheveux chatains clairs ou blonds et qui souhaiteraient raviver les couleurs<br>  <br>  Article signé par Ouahiba d'Amiens <br>  Lire la suite: le Ghassoul ou Rassoul|`|e558380e2f19fc4c11afe26751259ea2aa	As-tu essayé l'eau de javel?...je ne sais pas si ?a enlève les taches de henné,mais ?a fait dispara?tre pas mal de taches de toutes sortes de produits colorants...|`|4461ed21df7e31de54fdd0308bb4b270aa	avec le temps !! tout va tout s'en va !|`|682672352e50e15997e1c951e4e851bfaa	le henné est un tatouage semi permanent cad qu'il colorie la peau superficiel et part avec elle . sur le dos de la main ?a part dans une semaine . la paume est plus resistante 15jr de plus . rien a faire et surtt n'agresse pas ta peau avec des produits comme l'eau de javel ?a ne resoud rien . met des gants   et la prochaine fois pense y avant d'en mettre ;)|`|b8811e04e03d16b52980fb92a8a62948aa	Si tu fais un bon gommage ?a  l'atténueras .Comme le gommage élimine les peaux mort !

Your not going to want to wear a skirt or anything because you will most likely be jumping up and down in a crowd. Wear one of your favorite shirts and a pair of jeans or capris. Don't do anything special with your hair. Just throw it up in a ponytail. Trust me you are not going to want to keep your hair down cuz your neck will get sweaty. Just make sure you wear something that you are comfortable in, aside from the tennis shoes, and have fun at the show.|`|KYRQNJtiaa	A snug-fitting tee shirt, jeans or a jean skirt, and sneakers.|`|spY1aSMYaa	Just wear what you would normally wear to school.

You can hurt your toe or loose them. I know that you don't like them but you should wear tennis shoes. A skirt would be a little uncomfortable at a concert I would say shorts would be good; they can be blue jean or something else. Just a regular T-shirt would be good, maybe one that says Fall Out Boy???? Best way to do your hair is to straighten it or put it up in a pony tail. For your makeup wear just a little more than you would wear to school. But make sure not to over load it. But you can never have enough eyeliner, but you might want to go easy on it so people there won't think you are a poser.|`|be8ff2b693aae0625c3f229400f71467aa	Oh Fun! ok ok Where 3/4 quarter length light pants or capris which ever and a a thick tank top with crystyals on it or just a cute small tee.

That is how my hair is, minus the colors, its black with lots of stripe, zig & leopard extensions.<br>  When you get it cut, tell them you want lots of choppy layers and you want it shorter on top.

Def add the layers and shorter on top, I bet that would looked wicked cute on u..but this also depends on ur age ? If ur in high school then ok with the colors, if ur a working professional I wouldn't suggest it!  OR even do a more low key color line up and do bleach blonde, a much darker blonde and a very dark brown (but not black)...I own a nail salon and have worked with hairdressers for a long time...just talk before they cut and color!|`|QwNnZvDRaa	i like the red color but not the blonde tails....<br>  i think that they make the hear seam weak...<br>  <br>  anyway its your own hair!<br>  do whatever you want!!!!!!!<br>  ;)|`|JQsil5R9aa	go to the hair dresser and show them this pic|`|sf4KVjhsaa	print out the picture and give i to yoour hair stylestand thne tell them thats how you want your hair and they will do it|`|mZSkcgHUaa	Looks good.

6ElojG00aa	In Mumbai, some of the best places to get a variety of sarees would be:<br>  1. Queens Road at Marine Lines- but these can be expensive as they are high-end showrooms<br>  <br>  2.

Nalli's  at Mahalaxmi, is a famous shop for South silk sarees.<br>  <br>  Besides, ofcourse, there are numeerous shops ALL over Mumbai...<br>  Everyday sarees are either cotton, or synthetic wash-n-wear sarees. They are most commonly worn in the 'Nivi style'- wrapped and pleated in front, with the loose end thrown back, over the left shoulder.<br>  <br>   Silks are for festive wear but are tougher to maintain... cannot be washed, need to be wrapped in thin muslin for preservation... but my feminine hoarding instincts makes me buy them anyways... they'r too beautiful :) Happy shopping!|`|AA10579527	The Indian sari is worn in many styles, each reflecting a distinctive characteristic of the region of India where it was made. Today, many saris are manufactured by larger textile companies, and no longer bear the regional signatures of a handmade Indian sari For everyday wear, choose cotton saris for their durability and easy maintenance. A luxurious silk sari may be most appropriate for special occasions, as they are much more difficult to care for. They are also more vulnerable to sustaining damage due to wear, such as stains and tears. Im not sure where to purchase saris in mumabai although i will recomend the internet there are thousands of styles all over the web and most manufactures ship anywhere.  oh and i also added here a step by step on wearing sari's if you need it ..... <a href="http://www.kaneesha.com/how_to_wearsari.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaneesha.com/how_to_wearsari....</a>

Ne esistone 2 tipi una per i capelli scuri e una per i capelli biondi/rossi. i capelli diventano bianchi a causa della perdita di melanociti, cioè quelli che producono melanina.

yi3YqjD8aa	Si te ibas a alterar tanto para que rayos te lo cortaste??? no se te hace completamente incongruente???<br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<...<br>  <br>  Según los expertos nada realmente ayuda a que el pelo crezca mas rápido.  Ni la luna llena, ni ningún producto mágico pueden ayudar a que el pelo crezca rápido.  Algunos productos ayudan un poco pero es casi imperceptible.    <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  El pelo crece mas rápido durante el embarazo y algunas veces mas despacio por causa de algunas enfermedades.  El pelo crece mas rápido en los climas calientes o en verano que en climas fríos o invierno.   En tiempos normales el pelo el pelo crece a la misma velocidad. <br>  <br>  Existen varias circunstancias que hacen que el pelo crezca mas despacio o que se caiga. Si las evitas tu pelo crecerá al nivel mas alto posible, entre ellas:  <br>  <br>  1. Enfermedades y Medicamentos.  <br>  2. Estrés y Problemas Emocionales<br>  3. Una Dieta Inadecuada<br>  4. No cuidarse el cabello.|`|GO4WG8Bxaa	por mas remedios y tratamientos que se te ocurran, nunca podrás ir contra natura!!!!<br>  tal vez estabas muy acostumbrado a tu anterior estilo, pero animate y mostrá una actitud de seguridad de vos mismo, mirate varias veces en el espejo y volvé a reconocerte..... nada!!! animate y demostrá que es lo mejor que te pudo haber pasado y, cuando alguna mujer te vea, aunque sientas que quedaste muy feo, tu actitud ganadora la va a conquistar y te va a levantar la autoestima!!!<br>  suerte galanazo!!!!|`|B1gT56WYaa	Ummmm, yo estoy en las mismas, ya estaba bien matudote, y me lo tuve que cortar por que ya se me habia hecho feo por no despuntarmelo, ahora a esperar no hay de otra amigo.|`|a3f8f491222ee6826457037647382eb0aa	Compra aceite de culebra te lo untas en el craneo con un algodon y vas dandote masajes suaves con las yemas de los dedos, te pones un gorro y duermes con eso la noche entera, en la manana te lavas tu cabello normal, puedes repetirlo tres veces a la semana o todos los dias si gustas, tambien puedes comprar el shampoo y condicionador de aji que tambien hace crecer el cabello..........|`|eSik1FX8aa	shampoo crece aunque lo reseca|`|stBcqUt5aa	jaja tan feo te quedo?? jejej, no conosco nada casero.<br>  Habra que esperar.

Btsctjydaa	She told me her name was Susie the last time I went to the basement.|`|AA10285288	LOL. Doc, you crack me up. Hope the Yamster isn't in with the FBI. They will be storming your house. <br>  <br>  Sorry, Dreamweaver. To answer your question, I think I remember hearing about this, but don't remember a lot of details about it.
qQqC2cHIaa	Art and Libras, why do we go together so well?  Like hopeless romantics and Pisces, or fussy and Virgo.  <br>  <br>  The sewing machine isn't scary, trust me, I have nine of them in my workshop.  Like any other art and skill worth learning it takes time and practise to become good and it takes a willingness to experiment and try new things.  it also takes a willingness to make a few mistakes along the way and learn from them.  I could tell you stories about my mistakes!  <br>  <br>  Instead of tackling a big project like a prom dress or a shirt for an important occasion, try something easy and simple to build you skills, like a pillow case.  it's all straight lines and by the end you will have learned how to sew a straight line, how to turn, fold, press and top stitch a hem and how to sew something inside out and turn it right-side out.  I always use a pillow or a shoe bag for a first project when i teach beginners.  <br>  <br>  I also teach beginners to stick with simple garments with simple pattern shapes and make them in good, interesting fashion fabrics.  I also teach that adding personal touches, such as coloured top stitch thread, bead embroidery, sequins, or appliqués can make a simple t-shirt into something special.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to make things from scratch you can also take store clothes and customize them with fabric paints, crystals, sequins, or by altering their shape to fit you perfectly or to change the length width, etc.  <br>  <br>  Back to the sewing machine.  To get over your fear of the beast: sit down at the machine.  Take out the needle.  Put a piece of plain paper under the presser foot, lower the foot and press down on the foot pedal.  Try to make the sewing machine go fast, then slow, then somewhere in the middle.  Practise controlling the speed without the needle until you feel confident.  After that, place a needle in the machine, no thread.  Take a piece of paper and draw some straight and curved lines on the paper.  place the paper in the machine and practise following the lines and curves..  Practise until most of the needle holes are on the pencil line.<br>  <br>  Back when i took dressmaking in college long ago we spent the first few sessions doing that until we were accurate and we felt comfortable with the machines.  We then moved onto scrap fabric, and then we moved to an actual sewing project.  By that time no one was afraid of the machines.<br>  <br>  Finally, look for a few good sewing books,  The Reader's digest Book of Sewing is the one Tim Gunn of project Runway recommends for anyone who wants to learn how to sew.  You can find it in the public library and it's often in used book stores for cheap.  you don't need the newest edition, the older one is far better. Also the older edition of the Vogue Sewing book is a good choice.  It covers everything from the simple basics to advanced tailoring.<br>  <br>  There are sewing pattern made for beginners.  I use Kwik Sew's learn to sew patterns for many of my beginner classes.  Each one is like a sewing teacher in an envelope. Here's the website: <a href="http://www.kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_thumbs.cfm?Cat=Learn_to_Sew&Level=KWIK_Start&QL=KwikStart" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_thumb...</a>  We start with pattern number 3525: <a href="http://www.kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_detail.cfm?pid=3525&QL=KwikStart" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_detai...</a>  and then move to pajama pants and then a t-shirt.  If we have time in the six weeks we will do either a skirt or dress for girls and the guys do a polar fleece jacket.  ( i give a special sewing for guys course once a year) <br>  <br>  And give yourself time to make mistakes and get better.  I think you are probably a young teen, so you won't be perfect at first. It took me years to get good, and there are still new things for me to learn. At the very least sewing is a good skill to have for the future, even if you don't choose fashion as a career.  Good luck.|`|e27C5qAjaa	Its not hard at all. There's so many different stitches to learn, but start off with basic patterns, an you'll love it! Good luck.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	sewing machines are totally simple to use. and you should be scared, because you have control of what you are sewing and most of the time will not hurt urself (unless you are ttly klutzy =]) anyways fashion is an awesome way of expressing yourself. i love making my own clothing, because its always original and i allways get compliments and nobody ever has it! i myself used to be a shopoholic as well but then realized that i could get fab clothing for much lower prices than regular stores, plus my clothing is even better! you should learn how to sew by hand as well- always comes in handy, and not hard to learn<br>  <br>  best of luck,<br>  <br>  me|`|y075ayrKaa	sewing isnt hard but takes time if u want to be skilled<br>  use a sewing machine makes it easier!<br>  <br>  edit: dont worry about the sewing machine! i used it and if you go slow, its not scary. when your more skilled later, you can make the machine go faster and do it faster.|`|fvre0o9laa	Why not try a basic sewing class or two and see if you like it?  The really nice thing about learning to sew is that there's always something new to try if you're up for a challenge, and something easy if you're not.  And, because you sew, you can have pretty much whatever you want, often for much cheaper than you can purchase it.<br>  <br>  I'm currently working on an interview suit for someone, a synthesis of several things she saw and liked, but nothing was quite right, and all of them were $600 and up... way up.  $10 worth of interfacing, $10 worth of buttons, a buck for a zipper, $20 for lining and some $2/yard silk suiting from the local Pendleton outlet (ok, we had to buy extra because it came in shorter pieces)... and a couple of spools of thread.  Total cost is going to be under $100, and it will fit her superbly.  She gets to sew the next one...  <g>
6fPF6xp4aa	I think you should get depending on your taste. If you want more neutrals get the Lucky Tom palette if you like more color get the Too Dolly. I personally prefer the Lucky Tom because I think it is more wearable. Hope I helped!|`|RIpyjQ4waa	Too Dolly!|`|C1dRwOWAaa	I can't choose either there both adorable! I think I'll probably end up going for lucky tom thou :P<br>  You should probably take skin and eye colour<br>  into account and choose whichever works better for you :)<br>  <br>  Personally I think it's my fave mac collection yet! :D
mJbwemH8aa	Its not relevant.<br>  <br>  Massage is a technique based on what u know and how to make other fee good, not about strength.<br>  <br>  .|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Not at all. My massage therapist is a smaller girl and she is way better then the guys I had!|`|tumTO5otaa	Sweety, physical strength comes with learning massage ( I have been a massage therapist and teacher for over 20 years.....I'm so old it is scary)  A good massage therapist is one who can 'read' the body under hands and feel tension, you'll learn and develop that skill over time.  By all means hit the gym, to tone and strenghten your whole self, not just your hands. Good luck and go well
wFfeayBMaa	Those are lyrics from a Jack Johnson song.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I just bought it. It's not a shampoo. It's a cleansing conditioner. It cleans your hair like a shampoo would so you'll never have to use shampoo again. It's also a rinse out conditioner, deep conditioner, and leave-in all in one. Wen doesn't sell shampoo, and Chaz Dean, the creator of Wen, hasn't used shampoo on himself or his clients in years.<br>  <br>  I have a review about it here: <br>  <a href="http://forum.blackhairmedia.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=175571&PN=2" rel="nofollow">http://forum.blackhairmedia.com/forum_po...</a>

fRMFPBwTaa	use less of the frizz ease or tresemme<br>  your probably putting way too much in
ojceQQ1Paa	If you are darker, it would be harder than h#ll to tattoo you lighter, not to mention your skin would take ink differently depending on how thick/thin the skin is etc.  In other words, it would be mottled and uneven and look much worse than it does naturally.  Stop trying to look like someone else.  Chances are it is never going to happen.  Be yourself.  The grass is NOT greener on the other side of the fence.|`|H3PcFertaa	1st, you cannot successfully tattoo yourself to a lighter color.<br>  2nd, If you could it would cost you an incredible amount of money.<br>  3rd, you need to be comfortable inside of your skin. You cannot wear anybody else's, and you need to find out why you are so insecure about your unique individuality. There is no one on the whole planet like you! <br>  You will never be happy, until you realize this, and love yourself and be proud of everything about you.<br>  4th, You should seek some serious counseling. <br>  5th, live your life, <br>  6th, if this is a joke, you need to find a hobby or a good book or something.

Youve asked it a thousand times already! And why would you want to do that i dont think thats even possible! love you for you!|`|6zblh7Tiaa	This is just ridiculous, sorry but wow.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	lol. Why dont you ask Michael Jackson?|`|2Qwin8Yraa	Of course it is possible, just  look at Michael Jackson as an example. However, I really discourage you from changing your skin color, it is the one thing that can make you truly unique from everyone else. First of all, the procedure would most likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then, you may not even get the skin tone you really wanted. Right now, you may hate your skin color, but you will most likely hate it more if you get it changed.|`|SjY27tgsaa	They do sell skin lighting creams.<br>  I saw some in the hair/skin product aisles at Walmart (super Walmart)<br>  I found it in the 'african american' skin section.|`|tumTO5otaa	I don't know about changing the skin colour but I'd love a tattoo all over my body of exactly me but Taller and thinner....sort of like having my real self airbrushed!!|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	just to let you know that photo is photoshoped.<br>  and with tattoos comes scars... so your whole body would be a scar.|`|NekUbyUdaa	I'll do it for a million dollars!

hLdIO43Xaa	Pick a floral abercrombie shirt---should be flowy, pair it with flared jeans. Wear a boho-inspired belt. You probably don't want sandals, so go for moccasins.

Mayve get your eyebrows shaped a little, but don't pluck them so much that they're tiny little arches.

As for them being able to talk to the dead..no worries that is so unrealistic.|`|C1dRwOWAaa	Cherries symbolize feminine chastity and purity :)<br>  There is also an erotic link to cherries as they can be said to symbolize the lovers lips.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|M8B2i69gaa	Probably virginity.

Rf2r23sYaa	I'm not into skorts myself but I can tell you why girls where them. It's for modesty/emotional comfort. Physically they aren't more comfortable but emotionally they are because you feel assured that no one can see up your skirt. So, you can move around more freely and do athletic things too. You find a lot of ladies doing athletics in skorts (golf, tennis, running etc.).|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	Because, your underwear will not show, then you don't have to wear spandex. As if someone would look up your skirt or when your sitting or walking or running, one lift and theres your underwear.|`|T4ayWv93aa	well some do and some dont, some women feel more comfrotable knowing that men can perve under her skirt like most tend to do, or there just generally more confident with the shorts underneath,<br>  also alot of women wear them for sport, there well known in tennis and such sports.|`|FySNzOjzaa	those are called skorts  :]<br>  they wear them if they don't want people looking up their skirt haha<br>  or in the wind if your skirt would fly up, with a skort theres shorts underneath so there isn't a problem<br>  i haven't worn one of those since...i was in like 1st grade haha|`|uzfdgFSxaa	When you have to deal with an active 5 year old who has no problem lifting up your skirt in public, skorts are the way to go.|`|f7x1mHE3aa	we mostly wear them so you don't have to worry about pulling a marilyn monroe. lol.|`|3MM4JDlWaa	Well many girls wear shorts under their skirts anyway...idk.<br>  I'm more comfortable when I know that people cant accidently see up my skirts.|`|BSuO6CQvaa	it stops you showing your underwear, and its a more feminine thing to wear if your doing something active!!

jzSx5kAxaa	Girls LOVE guys who ooze confidence.  Being mysterious and aloof with a sense of a carefree attitude (including not giving her much attention) at times is more a turn-on to a girl than some shy/serious guy smiling.  And i strongly doubt the sound of a cold would ever be nice to anyone|`|dXdgS7e2aa	i love it when they act shy, but being shy might not be great if the girl you like is outing going, it get's annoying and awkward , annnd not they way they sound when their sick, it's just cute that guys are tough all the time and somthing as simple as a cold like takes over their life, it's cute .|`|G8QZFYqIaa	aw, guys are so cute when they blush. it shows that they can be human too. lol.<br>  <br>  and when some guys have a cold their voices get all husky and sound adorable.<br>  i know my boyfriend's does, i love it.<br>  but not that he's sick. :D|`|TWAmyQ6paa	I don't like shy guys, it makes me think they aren't interested in me.

No!|`|7KTH0B06aa	Yes|`|Q8UrDhPYaa	yeah<br>  and... the 2cnd one... ew no.|`|DPsUvdPjaa	YES! when you see a guy blush, it shows that they're not always a big-shot, though confidence is sexy. but when a shy guy drops smiles instead of running away from you, it attracts you to them, definitely.<br>  <br>  and wtf?|`|WVSpTxuCaa	i think its cute when a guy has that cute scratchyness lol and i love it when someone blushes tome cuzi know they like me btw im a girl lol i hope i helped|`|XyOsRQvgaa	smiles or blushes - yes, i think it's adorable :D<br>  voice when he has a cold - ahahah, my class went on this school trip for a week, and we had to do rafting and stuff in ice cold freezing water, and people purposely made themselves get colds so they could have raspy voices cause they thought they were hot. i remember everyone walking around sounding like they've been smoking for 50 years<br>  i'm indifferent to it.|`|tP2NScAiaa	smiles/blushing is cute.<br>  and no, not when they have a cold.<br>  everyone sounds weird when they have a cold.|`|yje6VNCpaa	if hes cute ii like it.<br>  <br>  but about the second one, ii dont mind if its my boyfriend or something, but it gets annoying after a while.|`|7nrhPCf0aa	for the 1st one, yeah it's cute<br>  the 2nd, wtf that's stupid|`|aDG8EteIaa	Yes ^_^<br>  Not the second though|`|rrRInNj2aa	yes :)<br>  and uhh haha no?

It drives me nuts!  I have even been on prescription medicine for it and it still hasn't completely gone away.  AND I WASH MY FACE MORNING AND NIGHT to the dummy who suggested you wash your face.|`|DvrpBX4saa	It's called "not washing your face, you dirty preggo lady" hormone. I'll buy you some Cetaphil.|`|FHi0v36eaa	The excess hormone is testosterone. Just ignore the women who said you need to clean your face, that was rude.|`|eIwj9a3yaa	testosterone|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Proactiv *****
ESAMvi4taa	It won't do anything.  Mayonaisse is made from eggs.  Many people think eggs are a good treatment because they are loaded with protein.  While it is true that eggs have protein, the protein molecules in eggs are actually too large to penetrate the hair shaft.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your hair is just crying out for moisture.  You should consider the curly girl method of hair care.  Check out <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/i...</a> for general help and check out this blog for an introduction to the Curly Girl method<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dormroomcurly.blogspot.com/2008/12/style-definitions-table.html" rel="nofollow">http://dormroomcurly.blogspot.com/2008/1...</a><br>  <br>  Also, as a good deep treatment, I recommend getting some Aubrey Organics conditioner from Whole Foods.  Very great conditioners and all natural.  For protein, get Aubrey Organics GPB Conditioner.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Whatever damage you have done is permanent, and "stepping away from the straightener" does nothing to help the hair.  Certainly you won't cause much more further damage, but the hair cannot repair itself.<br>  <br>  Mayonnaise is made of oil with a raw egg beaten in it.  That is all.  It contains nothing at all that is of any value to the hair.  It is best taken internally and be part of making the hair, but putting it on the outside just makes it greasy and dirty.  You wash it off (may take couple shampoos) and there is no lasting effects.<br>  <br>  It is a myth, and you have fallen for it again!   You have removed water from your hair, and you need to put water back in.  Oil does nothing for the hair other than coat the outside making it oily and greasy.  You need a good moisturizer to put water in the hair.  Look for products containing NaPCA -- Nexxus and Focus21 are good ones.<br>  <br>  But now that you have done the damage, it is very very hard to repair it.  You need to protect the hair until you can cut all this hair off and start over.  Don't damage it again as you did with this last bit.|`|vi2bzq0Caa	First of all....step AWAY from the straightener :)!<br>  Secondly, stay on the right track. Whomever informed you about the natural conditioner (mayo) knows what it takes to restore damaged hair back to its luscious self again.<br>  <br>  I have used mayonnaise in the past (Hellman's baby!) but I am unable to fully rinse all of it out of my hair. So for that matter alone, I do not use it anymore. Instead, I try protein treatments with eggs and olive oil. My kinky coarse hair absorbs this mixture best.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your hair journey!|`|bSiKrblGaa	No matter what you do, your hair will be damaged by straightening it every day. How is your hair supposed to regain its natural oils if you keep damaging it like that?<br>  <br>  Give it a break before you grow bald!|`|W5oUJgcuaa	You need to give it a break. It will condition it, but it needs a hot oil treatment.|`|FT9Krq8xaa	I have the same problem only I used heated rollers every day. After 4 months of this my hair is fried. Same thing; the problem is the heat. Mayonnaise does work for some people; it contains mostly oil and eggs (plus seasonings). I tried it once years ago and found it too greasy and hard to wash out. <br>  I've had pretty good luck with Joico K Pak Hydrating Cream as a conditioner. It comes in a tube. I just use like any conditioner. As with any conditioner though you have to watch for build-up. I vary between that and a little Pantene Classic Conditioner. Joico isn't cheap though. The tube lasts a long time; like about 3 months but that outlay of $20 hurts.|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	I would say give your hair a break from straightening it or use a product to be able to manage it without having to straighten it. Otherwise you will damage it even more if you keep using hot tools on your hair. Once you've trashed your hair you can't ' fix ' anything by applying product to it.. all you can do is put it in better condition and make it able to manage a lot better.<br>  All you can do is cut off whats fried, and keep using products. Eventually you'll grow out the fried stuff and then you'll have healthy hair. <br>  I don't believe you'll go bald if you keep straightening your hair. You'll just have fried.. really dry and gross looking hair if you do it constantly.<br>  Maybe you should just go with the curls more often, or do something to keep your hair looking nice without straightening. I'm sure theres better styles with what you have naturally.

4lTsTliJaa	For women, the practice of shaving the legs derives from a current cultural standard in the West that deems leg hair on women unattractive. This standard emerged during the early twentieth century, as women's legs became more visible owing to shorter hemlines, and when the safety razor made the practice of leg shaving practical. The reasons for this cultural standard are debated, but it is sometimes seen as an example of a cultural mechanism for increasing sexual dimorphism. Others have suggested that it was promoted as a means of selling razors to a broader segment of the populace.|`|UlQmiP51aa	I think the real question is when did MEN start shaving themselves and acting womanly??|`|9vjxfIkYaa	when men started complaining|`|vi2bzq0Caa	I cannot believe that someone actually took this question seriously...<br>  I only shave my legs in the warmer months
vVka4ZA0aa	Stretch marks are very normal for women because our bodies are almost constantly changing and our weight fluctuates more.<br>  <br>  To get rid of stretch marks, you can try regular lotion, but it won't be as effective.<br>  As having stretch marks, I used a coco/shea butter lotion specifically designed for stretch marks. (I found it at WalMart in the lotion isle with the coco butter. It's a smaller bottle, and it's usually in a little box. There's a sketch of what looks like a pregnant woman on it as well).<br>  Also, you can buy vitamin e capsules, break them open and rub the vitamin e directly on the stretch marks. <br>  You can try using olive oil on the area, maybe just before you go to bed since it is an oil and can feel a little greasy.<br>  Also, Jergen's has a skin firming lotion that may help with the stretch marks to improve the skin's elastin.|`|DoJkIFqbaa	Are you considering undergoing laser treatment to get rid of stretch marks? Interestingly enough, you may not need to undergo such a painful procedure. Today, there are creams available that will help reduce scar tissue, as well as rebuild some of the most vital layers of your skin. With just a few applications of these creams, you can get rid of unsightly scars without spending a fortune.<br>  <br>  Consider a situation where you thought you were not going to get stretch marks. Don't you wish you had tried using Revitol Stretch Mark Prevention Cream to stop them from developing further? Fortunately, it isn't too late to use this, or a similar formula to reduce scar tissue. At the same time, you are likely to be pleased with other improvements to the area where the stretch marks built up. This will include a firmer skin tone, as well as normalization of skin color.<br>  <br>  Do you need to know how to get rid of stretch marks in a hurry? Without a question, laser surgery is not going to meet your needs. Aside from taking several weeks to heal, you may also develop infections that will take even longer to heal. On the other hand, when you use an ointment dedicated to stretch marks, the results will not be undermined by post-treatment recovery.<br>  <br>  As you learn more about how to get rid of stretch marks, you will find that there are two basic methods. If you have not tried stretch marks creams, it may be of some help to try them before making use of laser surgery. Even if these creams do not completely eradicate stretch marks, they may reduce them to a bearable level. As may be expected, you will appreciate being able to avoid going for a surgical procedure that is likely to be painful and expensive.<br>  <br>  Lindsay Boyd is an expert on skin care.

I also had tried all sorts of things including vitamin E, which does help. I also tried Retin-A which I DO NOT recommend. But this stuff at the website above really worked for me.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	You can't get rid of them once you have them. But, since you're only 16 you're likely to get even more since you're still growing. Use really good lotion or body oil on that area every day until you're at least 20. That way you should be able to prevent them from getting worse. And, yes, it's normal.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	Vitamin E cream seems to really help.

Its not a diet you go on and then come off. Its more like changing the way you eat and what you eat and your portions. You can research it online or buy the book. You also need to exercise about 3 times a week to tone and burn fat. This is the only way to get rid of it.|`|2U27BgmKaa	Well, there are a few options. I used to have those types of problems and there are little tricks that you can follow in order to relieve these problems. Here are a few tips that you can try out:<br>  <br>  - Eat more fruits and veggies. The vitamins and minerals in these will help your skin retain more elasticity, therefore reducing cellulite. It will also keep the inside of your body clean and healthy. You should be eating 5 helpings of veggies and 4 helpings of fruit each day. You'll feel way more energized too.<br>  <br>   - Try using a textured cloth to wash yourself. These cloths will help to stimulate your skin and increase blood circulation. The exfoliation brings your skin back to life and helps it to stay tight. Here's the one that I use (I have three of each color!). Make sure that if you order off the internet, the seller is truerenu.com.

C1dRwOWAaa	Firstly I think a foundation primer is the met importaint thing in ones makeup kit! I would suggest smashbox photo finish or macs prep and prime!<br>  Then a foundation that matches your skin! That is the most common problem among girls that wear makeup! <br>  Then a concealer one tone lighter than your foundation.<br>  Set your foundation with a powder! Otherwise it will slide off your face!<br>  Always groom your eyebrows! There are lots of makeup brands that do eyebrow waxes and stuff but a bit of eyeshadow on an angled brush also works wonders, and a bit of hairgel for maximum control.<br>  Always match your blush to your lipstick.<br>  Put bronzer under not on the cheekbones to give defenition and on the forhead if you feel you have a long one and under the chin to give a sculpted look.<br>  Use highligter over your cheekbones for emphasis, eyeshadows or mac pigments are awesome for this. <br>  And lastly never match your eyeshadow to your outfit, it looks silly :P<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ;)|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Check out "Making Faces" by Kevyn Aucoin. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Faces-Kevyn-Aucoin/dp/0316286850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235677928&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Making-Faces-Kevyn...</a>|`|BnistnrIaa	less is more|`|6SqxGQsqaa	that girl is right... less IS more, but, if you just gotta have makeup like i do, then when wearing eyeshadow, i suggest ALWAYS wearing an eyeshadow base.  you can purchase great bases at sephora (like urban decay or bare ecsentuals) but i really love the ones they sell at mac.  i dont know if brushes are more "sanitary" than sponges when applying make up, but i always use them, because i find that you can controll the amount of make up that goes on your face, and they are great for blending colors together.  when it comes to lips i find that applying a base lets you wear whatever brand of lip gloss or lip stick you want, with the long lasting effects of a more pricey brand.|`|4imU3Y2Naa	don't overdo it. remember, makeup is only supposed to brighten up your face, not make it SUPER noticeable. like that other girl said, less is more.|`|T4ayWv93aa	its all about the eyes, emphasise them girl :)<br>  but never wear to much foundation you dont want look like a lolly pop lol.|`|KH4z50Yaaa	Here is a makeup tip for your eyes, always put a light base all over eye that helps brighten the eye and makes you look awake and re freshened, for a more dramatic look you can add the light base to the inner corner of your eyes and a dark color from the lash line to the crease of the eye and use eyeliner and curl eyelashes and put mascara and viola your eyes are set. You can get really good tips on youtube just type in makeup tutorials and there will be a lot to choose from.|`|fJxVMgSfaa	Always use a shadow primer like Urban Decay Primer Potion and that makes your eye shadow last all day without creasing. Make sure your foundation matches your skin tone. If you do heavy eye make up then go with nude or more understated lips. Vice a versa if you go with a bold lip then do a simple eye!

AA10849332	no piercer would do it because of cross contamination risks.<br>  <br>  <br>  the closest you're going to get to tow people being attached by piercing is people participating in pulling or certain forms of suspension art. and that is still different than having the same piece of metal stuck through two people's flesh.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	No you cannot but there is a thing called suspension. Suspension is where you stick hooks in your back or your chest I guess you could do that.|`|QvhPJAKyaa	what do you mean? a piercing that attatches you to someone else? if so, then probably not, that would just be weird.<br>  or do you mean, you and someone else having a piercing at the same time? in that case, only if there is more than one piercer.|`|AA11940634	Not if you want it to heal. A temporary piercing, yeah. That's kind of what a tandem suspension is. But if you pierced two people together and wanted it to last, I think the pulling would cause the body to reject the piercing.|`|eEznnpnVaa	At the same time? Not unless the shop has more than 1 piercer. But probably on the same appointment.|`|m2Q2099Vaa	haha that would be so amazing.<br>  aargh imagine if it got infected!|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Lol...<br>  They should pierce peoples tongues together :)<br>  That would be rather entertaining :)|`|QGz0ChuRaa	Its a joke guys... like... funny haha? Very random question... I liked it :P
q5S0q1CQaa	Once every 6-8 weeks<br>  |`|yFG0NhD4aa	like said above, if highlight, you probably can more often than full head coloring.  But, if you are trying to change your color, too, highlighting might be a good idea for you to gradually change your color in a more natural appearance.  if your hair grows faster (ie. vitamins, or whatever to increase growth speed).  I would say color no more than once a month, if you do it yourself, I hear the box stuff you buy in the store is more harsh than salons...that's just what I heard, so if you go somewhere, I would for sure ask your beautician, they know our hair better than we do, probably!|`|ewjWSm45aa	Depending on the rate of growth about every 6 weeks. But we are talking root touch up here! Only apply color to the rest of your hair for the last five minutes of the processing time. This will help to keep your hair healthy!
6rmLrZoEaa	My hair is exactly like that and the same color, mines just a tad shorter and thicker, but I've been letting it grow out. Anyway, for the color it's the a dark brown with auburn highlights I think. I don't know for sure, I've been blessed with natural dark brown hair and the weird red highlights in the sun! <br>  <br>  The cut is so simple. Get it about two inches down your shoulder and when you go for the layers, ask for LONG layers, that's what I did with my hair and it practically looks exactly like hers, also if you have thick hair, make sure that it will thin out with the layers, that's really imporant. I never realized that until the movie Twilight came out. Anyway, I wash my hair with herbal essence dangerously straight shampoo and conditioner. Trust me, from going from Biolage to herbal essence it works and smells so much better! I let my hair air dry because it naturally has waves to it, but when their is low humidity out, I will curl the ends of it just to give it more of a messy wave look. Also for advise, when you let it dry don't part it in an exact way, just let part naturally and run your hands through it for the messy look. <br>  <br>  You can use different serums or gels to keep away the frizz but I'm lucky enough not to get much, but I do have Biolage anti-frizz and I will use it if its humid out and it works greatly. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|BO28Mn8haa	lighter brown on the top, darker on the bottom half. then straighten your hair and curl only from the mid to ends of the hair. layered cut|`|UddHuspZaa	use a really bug curling iron or curlers.<br>  and just do random peices. for the peices that you don't do. do the bottoms only. <br>  hope i helped!<br>  do mine pleae<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsQxKH14W.7zvhdn3IljHsPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226094851AAMb1wJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|p8WIpBosaa	Section your hair into an upper and lower portions.<br>  Dye the underneath of your hair black, then dye the upper portion of it an auburn orangey color.<br>  Side sweeping bangs, facial layers.|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Get layers and apply hair spray to get the messy look

C1dRwOWAaa	As long as you put them on right. Hold them with a tweezers and apply glue then WAIT for about 30 seconds, or you can blow them. This makes sure the glue becomes tacky. Then put them on making sure you get the corners stuck down!<br>  There is loads of tutorials on YouTube too! :)|`|j2C4riJlaa	Yeah if you get them done at the mac shop!|`|WjGX7URaaa	Yeah they do stay on, you just need to put the glue on them first (OBVIOUSLY!) .<br>  But they do stay on well.. But SOMETIMES they tend too start coming off at the corners.. But that's ONLY if you didn't put enough glue on them! But don't go over board with the glue! Just make sure you put enough so that you think they'll stick .<br>  And don't put them TO close to your eyes.. Cause then your eyes can start to get really itchy and irratated from the glue.<br>  I put them RIGHT above the lash line, it blends in just fine ! <br>  (:|`|6SqxGQsqaa	YES! i wear fake eye lashes all the time and i do my make up by myself... i buy mine at target.. they are called "Ardell" i just buy normal ones, but you can get whatever kind you like.  i find that most eyelash glues are the same.  you can get either a black glue or a white glue that dries to clear (i get the white glue that dries to clear) take a small pin apply it to the fake lashes and blow on it a little so it gets sticky then apply it to your lash line with tweezers...hope this helps|`|e5MQTEMcaa	R CRAZY OR STUPID
I1oAAKwMaa	they do if you use the right glue and technique. heres a video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRi8dvC7mmY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRi8dvC7m...</a>|`|e5MQTEMcaa	R YOU STUPID YES|`|kKKlMnduaa	If you use the glue included in the package, they should stay on.<br>  Perma-lash is a longer-lasting glue sold seperately from the eyelashes.<br>  It also holds the eyelashes a couple of days longer.|`|RGG30rbkaa	The trick is to close your eyes and then stick them on with super glue... Works for me ... BUT OH THE WAY ... im blind<br>  <br>  Joking... it should stay on with stuff you can buy from the chemist|`|tfm1EiNyaa	ILL YOU DONT HAVE REAL EYELASHES
C1dRwOWAaa	Yes. They are not glued to the eyelashes but to the skin above them :)<br>  I would suggest putting a line of liquid eyeliner down where your going to apply the lashes first to make sure they look like there in a straight line, and there's no gaps :) <br>  <br>  There's loads of application videos on YouTube<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! ;)|`|e5MQTEMcaa	YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS|`|tfm1EiNyaa	it depends on which brand you buy and if your friends and family who know you have no eyelashes are b***h's <br>  <br>  <br>  the best brand to buy is cosmo girl and if your friends and family are mean and will say out in public " HEY YOUR EYELASHES ARE FAKE!!" then i advise you not to get fake eyelashes

Just think of the permanence  of it.<br>  <br>  If you have a certain design that has a lot of meaning to you and has for a long time, by all means you should go for it, but anything you are asking for advice on probably is not that important to you. Save the tattoo for something worth the permanence.

Just say 'heart' to the tattoo artist - I am fairly sure he'll know what you mean. If you want to see what it would look like, draw one on your foot. That way you can see what it would look like on YOUR foot as opposed to someone elses. If drawing a heart is beyond you... then I don't know what to say.<br>  <br>  Can I ask how old you are, by the way?|`|kCdISEGqaa	Didn't you just ask about a small black heart?|`|p6oDbJxOaa	I think that a star would be good.

qeNrGoMsaa	Cover girl is a good one to start with, or the drug marts sometimes have there own brands and they will run sales on it. Always check the Shoppers Drug Mart, JCP Drug Mart, and Walmart. Remember ask for samples at any place you go. My girls learned that and have come home with bags of stuff from different places. Also the Dollar Store has a foundation that is remarkably light and the girls buy it, and I have the endless wallet so they could have what the want..... They also buy their lip gloss...... so for 2 bucks you can have 2 items off your list. What I do like about the dollar foundation it lasts all day and doesn't make their father notice. :-) I however order my stuff from the UK at Boots.....|`|hIqi0VCgaa	Im fourteen too!

kvmWDuOJaa	Get them to cut it off to whatever length you would like it to be. As long as you lose at least a couple of inches it will be fine.<br>  Once you've had it cut, I recommend<br>  <br>  If you're still short on money, shop around before you choose what hairdressers you go to. I have one that comes to my house and it costs about a quarter of what it would in a salon!<br>  I also recommend finding out if there are any hair dressing courses near you. Often there are trainee hairdressers that need practice cutting real hair on real people, and you can get your hair cut absolutely free of charge by them. They don't let the complete amateurs do your hair, and if somehow they mess it up, you should get it fixed by a professional free of charge. It's such a good option for people who are short of money, it's really underrated.<br>  <br>  Once you've had your hair cut, invest in a hydrating hair mask- one that you can leave on for a while. It will make your hair a lot healthier and softer in one use. I personally love the ones on this website:<br>  <a href="http://lush.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lush.com/</a><br>  Because they smell gorgeous, work really well, are very reasonably priced and are natural with no nasty chemicals to damage your hair.<br>  But take a look in your local drug store and see if you can find anything different that you'd rather use.<br>  Also, every other time you wash your hair, use a conditioner to keep it soft, healthy and strong.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!

It sounds like you need to get some good conditioner but if you can't afford that then use olive oil or coconut oil. One thing you could do would be to hold a strand of your hair between your fingers; slide your fingers down your hair from top to bottom. Where you feel your hair become thinner or more course that is probably where you need to cut it.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	You should ask your hairdresser. They'll be able to tell how much you need to take off. In future if haircuts are so far apart you should use some v05 hot oil. You get a little bottle that costs about ￡1 and it helps to keep your hair healthy by keeping the moisture in. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA11625446	go to the salon and get at least an inch cut off at the least,  and weekly give your self a hot oil treatment, it helps a lot.  <br>  <br>  With taking at least an inch off your hair will look fuller, thicker and you will be removing the brittle ends.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Ask your hairdresser... depends on the damage to your hair.

If you haven''t had a hair cut in about 2 years now I would say they need to cut 3-6 inches.

But don't freak out, this will promote faster growth and healthier hair. Whatever they need to cut, let them, it will do it a world of good.

kvmWDuOJaa	The spots that you're talking about are ingrown hairs. It's perfectly normal to get them, especially down there and on your underarms when you shave.<br>  There are some things you can do, though, to stop it from happening and to make it comfortable =)<br>  <br>  *  Shave after the hair has been wet for at least 5 minutes. Hair that is wet and full of moisture can be cut easily. Hair that is not well saturated can be very strong and tough. As the razor passes over, the hair is pulled up from the follicle. After it is cut it retracts below the skin surface with the resultant risk of it growing into surrounding tissue.<br>  <br>  * Shave in the direction of the hair growth. Cutting with the grain not against it will prevent hair being cut too short.<br>  <br>  * Prevent ingrown hairs by avoiding repeat strokes over the same area. Repeated strokes can also result in hair being cut too short.<br>  <br>  * Shave with the skin in a relaxed condition. Do not stretch the skin too taught. A little pressure may be necessary but excessive stretching can again result in hair being cut too short.<br>  <br>  * Use Tea Tree Oil twice a day in conjunction with a loofah bath or shower. Tea Tree Oil has a bacterial ability to kill infection and prevent pustules forming. (Avoid the eye area)<br>  <br>  I found that information here:<br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Prevent-Ingrown-Hairs-When-Shaving-Or-Waxing&id=75" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Prevent-Ingrow...</a><br>  Also check out this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.skinbiology.com/ingrownhairs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinbiology.com/ingrownhairs....</a><br>  <br>  It may also be easier to use a hair removal cream like Nair.

It hurts a bit the first couple of times, but you don't even notice it after a while.|`|NPhepcBkaa	Use Nair hair removal cream, I use that and it's great, and no rashes!|`|7TEwrKJjaa	I use a lady shaver and have no problem...Razors make me Itch more,<br>  Shave when your soaked in a bath <br>  <br>  x|`|hOTrfGHEaa	use immac just don't to close or it will hurt then trim the bottom|`|VlTGV9DUaa	? when u first get in the shower/bath, exfoliate the area ur going to shave using a bodyscrub!<br>  <br>  ? leave shaving to the last thing u do when ur in the bath/shower, as the heat & steam from the hot water opens your pores & makes shaving easier.<br>  <br>  ? put on alot of hair conditioner (yes hair conditioner for ur head!) on the area ur going to shave, and leave it for 3 minutes, then add the shaving foam massage it in well.<br>  <br>  ? use a new clean razor everytime u shave, also Mens razors are alot better an more gentle so i recommend one of those, or u can clean an already used razor by leaving it in a cup of BOILING water for a minute.<br>  <br>  ? shave really slowly and gently being very careful until its nice and smoooth.<br>  <br>  ? this parts really important in my opinion (if shaving your privates)-if u suffer with shaving rash or ingrown hairs, u need a cream thats used for babys nappy rash such as Bepanthen or Sudocrem and apply this thickly onto the area, when that layer has soaked in, if u have time before ur going out or seeing your boyfriend etc. apply another coat.<br>  <br>  ?Obviously before u get dressed or see your boyfriend etc, make sure you use a cold flannel or babywipe to gently wipe off any remaining cream from the area (obviously coz of the white colour and the babynappy smell haha) in downward strokes, going with the direction your hair would grow, never rub it upwards as it hurts as u probly know!<br>  <br>  ? i also moisturise down there with palmers cocoa butter/baby oil (dont get any on ur actual 'ladybits') just the part at the top and down the sides to make it smooth|`|SKiWDB8gaa	yeahh, i get that. <br>  i find waxing helps, burt hurtss badd!<br>  so i wax and shave, if you get me?<br>  and ingrown hairss are fun to get at with tweesers!<br>  haha|`|201f5471ae32e2ee201002f28996bacaaa	I use hair removal, like nair or something like that. The red spots are razor burn .. and they go away. But try a hair removal. It works for me!|`|DoJkIFqbaa	Shave after a hot Bath ur skin gets softer and its easies to shave .<br>  <br>  And Extra Tip: cool after shaving, creme ,creme. but if its get worse, buy a more expensive shaver or use cremethat removess hair|`|LuDu27z2aa	Stop shaving then, when I guy goes down on you and sees those spots he is g oing to think your have an STD...no spots more pleasure! email me for more tips|`|Kfn2XlZAaa	try waxing instead of shaving|`|9tqlD4vcaa	its just cuz your skin gets irritated.<br>  ive had that happen. <br>  i use this cream and its called 'anit bumps'.<br>  works for me
pcdEb8kMaa	It sounds like a cyst only a doctor/dermatologist can remove them.They will numb the area and open it and take it out you may not even need a stitch.I have one on my wrist been there for a while doc said if it don't bother you or get any bigger leave it alone for now.|`|D4NOrqM7aa	put a dab of honey on it... then cover with a bandaid.<br>  this will get rid of it in one or two nights!|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Can I have a picture to see what it looks like? there are many different reasons for spots to appear. If I see what it looks like I'll be able to tell you better. Maybe.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I don't know what your spot looks like, but I got a spot on my shoulder after getting badly sunburned, and it started as a small red dot that looked like a pimple, but slowly got bigger and bigger, and by the time it was the size of a pencil eraser I went to the dermatologist.  They cut it off and I have this ugly scar because of it, and now the spot is growing back underneath my skin again. Go to your dermotologist now! Don't wait, it could be cancerous or you could end up with a nasty scar|`|nDHzrfvSaa	It could be a cyst as the people above have said.however,by my experience,i had a blood clot once that was this way.get it checked by a doctor.that is the best option.<br>  <br>  take care.<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS U.
9tqlD4vcaa	ya. i hate my nose to. and i read on the internet that if you pinch it closed for ten mintues a day it would slowly get smaller. <br>  but, then i read that it doesnt really work. only surgery does. :(|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think that requires surgery sorry :(|`|p6oDbJxOaa	Sorry, but I don't think that would work. All that would do is make your nose look really red in the morning. My advise is to just let it go, but if you really want to change your appearance, you could always get surgery.
RN7NzeCsaa	just make sure your hair is all equal in length, you don't want pieces of your hair sticking out because its not long enough|`|vi2bzq0Caa	So what exactly are you? Black or White? or a sexy mixture of both?<br>  <br>  Sure, you can definitely cornrow your hair. Just make sure to use an oil, perhaps tea tree or jojoba, both of these oils are fragrance free so you do not have to worry about your hair smelly all girly. In addition, please avoid ridiculous beads on the ends of your hair. If you must, try cowry shells. Not only are they more masculine but they speak volumes about your heritage.
0UOHex1Maa	You're both pretty.<br>  Your hair is SUPER SUPER SUPER gorgeous!:D|`|blwDnJy4aa	That puffy lip thing is seriously ugly on you, and on every other girl out there. You guys look disgusting.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	No. I concur with hairbender because he is on spot regarding hair growth. Hair grows from underneath the scalp and it's pre-determined by your genes and nothing can change this. On average, hair grows 1/2 inch per month, or 6 inches per year. Some people's hair will grow faster, and others will grow slower, but most will probably fall into the average - I know I do. <br>  <br>  My hair is about an inch or two past my ear and I cut my hair last summer to less than an inch so I could go natural. I've retained ALL of my growth since then because I've kept my hair from breaking off, and because of this I expect to have at least shoulder-length hair by the time the one year anniversary of my cutting my hair comes around. Focus on length retention and this will help your hair get longer. <br>  <br>  If your hair is damaged then start doing hot oil treatments with a *natural* oil. Go to your local grocery store and buy some extra virgin (or pure) olive oil; warm it in the microwave; massage it on your scalp and hair for about 5 mniutes; rinse; shampoo/condition like usual. Do this regularly and you'll notice your hair will start improving and getting stronger, and you'll notice the other benefits it has. I do this every time I cleanse my hair, which is about 1-3 times per week. Out of all the hair products I own this is the ONLY thing that has actually improved the my hair's health.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.motowngirl.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.motowngirl.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nappturality.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nappturality.com</a><br>  <a href="http://forum.blackhairmedia.com" rel="nofollow">http://forum.blackhairmedia.com</a>|`|154dzJ1Faa	If you mean protecting your hair from further damage, and in that way helping the hair grow, it may.  But is it going to change the way the hair is programmed to be, no.  Nothing you put on the outside of your hair is going to change, or improve the way the hair grows.  You can only change what is on the outside -- but what comes out of the skin is always going to grow as it always has, as long as you are in good health.  You got the genes from your parents, and you can't change that.  The hair root does what it is supposed to do.|`|vi2bzq0Caa	Finally!<br>  <br>  Someone asks about KeraCare. I thought that one of the best hair care brands out there on the market was going to soon be forgotten :) Psyche! I am totally exaggerating on that one! Anyway, yes, KeraCare does help your hair to grow...but it does just the opposite for your wallet :). I would use KeraCare if I had a job, but I just cannot stray away from Bioinfusion. This stuff is addictive. You have got to try it. Sulfate-free shampoos at an affordable cost. Only $7.99! Can you believe it. That serves only as a fourth of the cost that I would be charged for a salon sized shampoo that offers the same results.<br>  <br>  But as usual, I probably will never learn and will continue to buy hair products to no ends. Oh, well! I will face it! I have a passion for flashing...my hair that is!|`|okX7dyl0aa	To tell you the truth it doesn't.It just help keep your hair healthy and moisturized (it's one of the good brands though).If you really want your hair to grow you must take care of it.Think of it like a flower if you don't water it, fertilize it and generally take care of it.It will never grow to it's full potential.So learn how to take care of your hair ;a good place for that is this forum:<a href="http://blackwomentalk.forumotion.net/forum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://blackwomentalk.forumotion.net/for...</a> ,have a healthy diet /proper nutrition and your hair will grow healthy and long.Good luck
KXxlYVjqaa	i weigh about the same as you and i wear a twelve<br>  they're long on me but im about 5 inches shorter than you lol<br>  so maybe a 12 or a 14 slim|`|pdl55IbRaa	Hi I think you should go to abercrombiekids and try them on but I am also a 00S in american eagle but I had to get them hemmed. They might not be to long because since they are for the kids they probably wont be but if you were going to get them at abercrombie they would be. If you didnt have to hem the american eagle ones you wont have to hem the abercrombie ones!|`|QzfHwGOQaa	14 Regular. <br>  <br>  I wear a 00S at Pac Sun<br>  Don't fit in AE <br>  Hollister is to long. <br>  And I am 12 Regular.|`|6wZ6tZtBaa	Probably a 12 or 14.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	i would suggest going to a store and trying them on..that is the only way to officially decide unless you bought all three sizes online and then returned the ones that didn't fit...|`|B0nTbAkwaa	you have to honestly try it on like at Hollister I wear a 5long but i don't even fit at abercrombie & fitch because my legs are too long (i'm 5'10") and my hips are very wide.
gmhlYqtgaa	Yes, you should. I have mine pierced, and its TOTALLY worth it! I would go with Sterling Silver, not gold. I got mine pierced twice, once when I was like 5, and then one when I was like 6. I would do it! Hope this helped! There are not really any risks, just getting them infected.|`|8X4Lxteeaa	you should! :)|`|vIw3cplFaa	yes|`|GQCDySQLaa	theres no risks <br>  just get them pierced|`|GXVanwgPaa	it doesn't hurt much but they r sore after for about 2 hrs|`|oobdNWdBaa	yes|`|taOckxHxaa	No.  If you don't feel comfortable doing it and like the unpierced ears, don't do it.|`|BJ4Q6QoQaa	Im 13 and i just recently got mine pierced.

Trust me, You wont regret it :D|`|Mwxuzq1Baa	Yes, I'm getting one more on my ear.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If you're scared of the risks involved with having pierced years, I suggest you go to a reputable piercing parlor that uses needles.<br>  Yes, needles.<br>  <br>  The piercing guns can't be properly sanitized and can ruin the ear lobe possible because it's blunt force against your ear.<br>  <br>  It might be a bit more expensive, but it's better than some inexperienced 20 year old at Claires piercing you.<br>  Less chance of infection, you'll get PROPER treatment information, and what-not.|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	You may hear all those stories about ears that get infected, but you have nothing to worry about if you remember to keep cleaning your ears, you can normally buy this sort of meths stuff from the place you get your ears pierced and dab it on your ears, it does help and you shouldn't get infected ears if you do this.|`|R0jKoq6Kaa	i'm 13, and i don't have my ears pierced either.<br>  i think if you are scared or don't want to pierce them, you don't have to. About the being the only girl who doesn't have pierced ears, it shows you're unique! i'm not so anxious to get my ears pierced, i thought it's gonna be a lot of trouble. Well, if you really want to pierce them, just take good care of them and you'll be fine.<br>  Hope this help:)|`|ZY2GT7edaa	if your scared, dont.<br>  really, i went through the phase where i wanted to get my ears pierced because EVERYONE had theirs pierced. however, i'm older now, and i rarely wear earrings.<br>  when you feel ready or feel you must get them pierced go right ahead<br>  btw, they feel like a sharp pinch and hurt for less than a second|`|Fj4ESamzaa	yes you should get them. Actually you should have gotten them a long time ago. Its okay get them now. The first week or so you'll feel pain then it will be okay. It heals fast. And get them from some professional or something otherwise some store people use infected needles. Be careful and Enjoy wearing new earrings!|`|1sfYOZNbaa	definatly! as long as you take care of them you will be fine. its great having earring especially when you like to accessorize.|`|LTtXyWeeaa	you should. the only way they would get infected is if you don't take care of them.|`|yz3pDCvnaa	sure it dosn't hurt that bad its sounds like a stapler lol ya go for it|`|KX6DYDHOaa	sure i dont see why not...i got mine done when i was ur age....now im almost 18!!!!<br>  if ur worrried it'll hurt..it doesnt!!! Trust Me!!|`|vk6sczbLaa	If you care to wear earrings often, then go ahead and get them pierced. The risks aren't too many as long as you get them professionally done. Just follow the instructions given to you and keep your ears clean.<br>  <br>  If you don't and would rather just wear earrings for special occasions or just very rarely, there are clip on earrings or magnetic earrings that work just as well. I don't know if there's a great selection of them though.|`|iVSv9zxLaa	Dont be scared to get ur ears pierced!!!!!!!!!! LOOL if you do it professionally theres VERY LITTLE CHANCE of anything going wrong, or any infection happening, i have 3 piercings on each ear and a bellybutton ring :) its so beautiful and ull love it! u can have fun with so many accessory's, go for it! and dont worry it doesnt hurt, feels like a teeny tiny pinch for half a second ;)|`|MV88n6Exaa	i got mine perced when i was about seven<br>  dont worry!<br>  i never heard of people getting their ears peirced worng.<br>  if u squeeze something like a teddy bear or someones hand it helps.<br>  its a quick pinch and then its over with.!<br>  it will hurt a little after, but they give you special stuff to stop and infections that may accure.<br>  also remember, if you relalize you have sensitive ears, you should only wear only sterling silver and gold, to avoid infections.|`|jtI1jCX5aa	It is completely up to you and your parents. If you want to wear ear rings and it is okay with your parents, then go for it. If not, don't. I think it is a decision that you have to make for yourself.  There aren't all that many risks involved if you get them done at a professional place. Good luck.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	it's really hard to Not be able to pull off ear piercings. especially just the lobe which that's what it sounds like your wanting to do, you didn't really say. uhm..it's actually pretty much painless and there are no risks, i don't understand why you seem so scared and nervous like there going to kill you or something but..alright..there's  no need to worry..0_O|`|c7ee727afb26df28f827deb57db1035eaa	I've had mine pierced since I was a few months old, so I don't remember how much it hurts.  The only dangers with it is if you don't take good care of them, they'll get infected.  If you do, then there will be no problems with it. I think its hard to find earings that I like to wear on an everyday basis.  But they are a great thing if you want to look fancy!<br>  O_o  cheEto|`|8929fa2803b58abe640d9bd8cb8c209eaa	I would do it. The risk of cauliflower ear is very low if your not piercing your cartilage and it's not a huge, noticeable hole if you decide to not wear earrings. It only pinches for a second and just make sure to keep them clean so that they don't become infected.|`|S5zsyCcqaa	yes<br>  pierced ears are safe. just dont go to claires! they screw up. go to your doctor or a jewler or something.<br>  <br>  yes you should get them pierced! just be sure to clean them with the cleaner they give you, and if they dont give you any just use some rubbing alchohal!<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|K4OIzRIxaa	I sort of wish that I hadn't pierced my ears just because I don't wear earrings and I also developed an allergy to nickel. <br>  <br>  <br>  But, it is your choice, and it is nice for you to have the choice to wear earrings or not from one day the next.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There ARE risks such as developing an allergy to nickel (like me), or an infection.<br>  I've had friends that have gotten an infection even if they clean them properly.|`|idmz2tvraa	well if you like not having them pierced, then don't.<br>  but if you want to then go for it. <br>  it doesn't hurt that bad and if you clean them with rubbing alcohol for the first few months they probably won't get infected.|`|5P3spnOWaa	Haha there really aren't that many risks...I love my ears pierced; picking out earrings is so much fun!!

vYAgIMLdaa	I wear nylon slips (made like panties, not Y fronts).  Much like those you wear, only with a high waist. They support well and feel great (comfortable too).

1xr6T6h0aa	smashbox is my FAV foundation.  it is $38 dollars and well worth every penny.  it is an "hd" formula that reflects light and makes your flaws disappear.  i have horrible skin and yet when i wear it people actually comment on how good my face looks and then say - you don't wear make up, do you???  <br>  <br>  having said that, i do like the neutrogena soy based foundation.  i used that for quite awhile before moving up to smashbox.  <br>  <br>  in addition, go to sephora and they will recommend something for you in your price range and you can test out many kinds and find the perfect one for you.  if you are not ready to buy, ask for a sample to take home with you, and they will make a little jar up for you.  that way you can test it and see if it works for your skin.<br>  <br>  one last thing - light reflecting foundations are popping up at the drug store.  try checking one of those out.|`|t9KytOdgaa	Not sure about foundation, but DEFINITELY try Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara....its in a fat orange tube and it has a rubber brush! Everyone thinks I wear false lashes because of how amazingly long my lashes look with this mascara on. All of my friends use it now!|`|AQwoCjj3aa	Maybelline pure make-up <br>  Cover girl True blend|`|5gFjfCGgaa	As far as drug store products, try looking into the newer types of makeup like Mineral Makeup...i think covergirl and maybelline all came out with thier own versions.  You have to use a specific brush for these types of make up, but honestly they are the very best at natural coverage, no cakey feel, and they actually improve your skin and make it glow, and it stays all day no touch ups.|`|BvjPU3wkaa	I recently picked up a bottle of Almay's Nearly Naked foundation and I really liked it. I'm actually surprised that I like it so much.  It's not a ton of coverage but it's lightweight and leaves your skin with a beautiful dewy finish.  It's fantastic!|`|aEpPt9koaa	In my opinion maybelline is the best drug store make up but if you can dish out an extra 5 dollars why not buy clinque or another department store brand. They are better quality and last longer because you only need a little bit to do the job.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i love boots NO7 foundation. its a UK brand  but they sell it at target and some drug stores. its like 12 bucks and its the best foundation!|`|AA12227599	If you have large pores you shouldn't use a liquid foundation unless it has a matte finish. You are so young, can't you just use powder ?  If not I would try a powdered foundation. I prefer L'oreal myself. I did see one on TV the other day that they poured over a golf ball and it didn't settle in to the holes, so maybe you could find out what that is and try it if you do prefer liquid.|`|wtWpXEp8aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

wJWOTGP8aa	that hairbender dude is a fag lol<br>  ur not a man, ur prolly a beautiful woman<br>  i know what ur talking about...i would go with the bleaching thing that one person said<br>  <br>  everyone on here is a complete idiot<br>  it IS true that after shaving, ur hair will turn black<br>  like when u first started shaving ur legs, didnt the hair soon come in black and not white anymore? yeah u idiots.|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	Well first of all shaving is a no no it'll just keep coming in thicker and thicker. <br>  <br>  Try a different brand of wax for now.<br>  <br>  Laser hair removal is the best but it's EXPENSIVE.|`|07uJlQrvaa	bleach them and trim them.<br>  <a href="http://www.sallyhansen.com/product.cfm?product=119" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallyhansen.com/product.cfm?p...</a>|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Shaving does not make your hairs turn black.  Hormones do.  They weren't black before because you were just a kid.<br>  <br>  Well, waxing irritates everyone's skin.  A breakout is pretty normal.  However, if your skin is getting raw or bleeding, you need to have it done by a pro.  You are probably using too much wax.  <br>  <br>  Is it just a few hairs?  Could you pluck them?  If it's your full face, you might want to see a doctor.  That's a very common symptom of ovarian polycystic syndrome, which can lead to infertility later in life.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise dark hair on light skin is PERFECT for laser hair removal.  It's pricey, but I think you'd be glad you did it|`|154dzJ1Faa	It's an absolute myth that shaving will make the hairs grow in black.  You should be ashamed of telling lies like that.  It is completely and utterly false.<br>  <br>  You have a male avatar, so hairs do grow dark on your chin. That is just the way it is supposed to be.  Whether or not you like it, you are "like a man" and that's the way it's going to be.  You need to accept who you are.  You have a very big problem, and a few hairs on your chin are hardly anything to worry about.  That is the way nature works.  Accept it.  You ARE a man!|`|0OcuBkFDaa	um<br>  how old r u? u could get that lazer surgery stuff to get rid of the hair<br>  or you could like get that thing on tv, its like this little pad thing and it zaps away all the hair or somthin<br>  or the "tweezy" thing, also on tv, its this little object thing when it likes plucks the hair out, it will be better than waxing probably<br>  but ya if that doesnt work than i suggest to just keep to waxing and get somthin to treat the acne or redness =(<br>  hope this helps!
e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	You can plan on paying anywhere from $50/hr for the low end artists(not recommended) all the way up to 250/hr for the big name artists.  Just make sure its really what you want, go visit a couple of tattoo shops, tell them what you want, ask to see their work, and remember..the lowest price is not always the best, and neither is the highest.  Do some research first on the different artist and shops...|`|gB2HfKk5aa	You have to go to the tattoo shop to get it priced..|`|7af4f45c6d9bbb38a7947804052fa112aa	mine is in the same spot and it cost me around 180 or something like that....but u have to get it priced out wherever ur getting it cuz some ppl charge more or less than others =)|`|CgItY1U5aa	Expensive.....I guess it depends where you get it done too.  Are you sure you want one there?  Some of my friends got one there during the past few years and they all regret it now.  Mine are easy to expose but easy to conceal.  I dont regret any of mine but to each's own right?  I just hope you really think about it before you actually do.  Good luck!|`|NuHMx9jUaa	It depends on what place you go to, to get it done, go in and ask different places...<br>  I got a big one on my arm and at one place they were going to charge like, $300 to $400 and the place that I went to only charged me $200.|`|Qa9HPKBSaa	It will be expensive, Please reconsider the "tramp stamp" -those lower back tattoos are disgusting.|`|uwFwgq1Yaa	well it all depends, if you come up with design yourself then it will be cheaper, if you ask for the tattooist to draw you out a design it will cost you more. The more ink you have the more expensive it will be. I have a large tribal black ink butterfly across my lower back, you can see it on BMEink.com and it cost me ￡45. This is due to me having it done in someones dinning room, however the standard rate is going to be different where ever you go as it's a bigger competition than football. You'd be lucky to get it done for ￡40, but wherever you go tell them exactly what you want, don't be afraid to tell them if they get the wrong idea after all it's permanent on you. And don't be afraid to barter, there is never a set price on an original design so if you think it's worth less then barter. Hope this helps. Oh i never actually said a price, oops, right for 10 snowflakes across lower back 2 sets of ink, take about 1hr and half i reckon you would be asked to pay at least ￡70 in a decent parlor but again barter.

AA11678263	The 34 is your back size, and the B is your cup size.  If the bra fits around your back, you are a 34, and should try a bigger cup size (34C).  If it is too small around the back but fits in the cup, try a 36B.<br>  <br>  There is a guide here: <a href="http://www.lingeriebrands.co.uk/info-advice/lingerie-advice/how-to-measure-your-true-bra-size/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lingeriebrands.co.uk/info-adv...</a> for how to calculate it yourself.

They will assist you in getting  the perfect fit.|`|yudWHXx4aa	get measured or do it yourself:<br>  <br>  measure the fullest part of your bust (from your back around your nipples)<br>  then, measure just underneath your breasts, where the band would sit. This is your band measurement.<br>  <br>  if the difference between the two measurements is 1" you are an A, 2" is a B, 3" is a C.<br>  <br>  you may need to just find a store that carries a bra size that fits you well becuase they can vary from store to store.|`|nDHzrfvSaa	it is better that U measure Urself up.Maybe U have put on weight or Ur bra has shrunk.Check Ur size again.I hope U know how to determine the exact bra size.It is as follows...<br>  Wrap the tape measure around the top part of the chest, going underneath the armpits but staying above the breast tissue. The resulting number is the BAND SIZE. If the measurement is an odd number, round down to the next even number.Wrap the tape measure around the fullest part of the bust, circling it completely around the body and across the nipples. Keep the tape measure mildly loose, as a too-tight measurement will result in a too-small bra cup.3<br>  Subtract the band measurement from the bust measurement. The resulting number is the CUP SIZE, with each inch of difference representing the next size up. For example, if the band measurement is 34 and the bust measurement is 36, the resulting cup size is a B. If the band measurement is 34 and the bust measurement is 37, the resulting cup size is a C.Also,If the difference between the bust measurement and the band measurement is less than 1 inch, the cup size needed will be either a AA or AAA. Try on both sizes to see which is more comfortable.<br>  <br>  Get Urself a proper bra.all your worries will go.else,U will end up losing the beauty and shape of Ur bust.<br>  <br>  hope it helped<br>  <br>  take care.<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS U.|`|fQLeIAh1aa	Different styles and brands run slightly different in sizes. My opinion is to go to a store like JC penny, Sears Victoria's secret and have them size you. Dont wear the smaller ones they can cause health problems.

She also said you want the bra on the first hook since over time it stretches and then you use the other hooks. She also said that your straps are not to be tightened to the same spot, since one breast is always bigger than the other. Hence you adjust the one that is sagging a bit more. I have a half century not realizing some of these hints.<br>  I agree go into a lingeree shop that sells bras, or a highend undergarment store and get measured...... If I can learn at 5? so can anyone and it really helps the girls to be in the proper position....|`|7af140afa7ad5f1b7e3e83e5df67840caa	where is it too big or too small.  Is it the cup itself or the band?  Playtex has nearly sizes for women who do not fill out the cup itself.  The bands usually have 3 different settings, so you should be able to adjust.  Try a 34 Nearly C.  You can go to a department store and try Thank Goodness It Fits, or a discount store and try Half Sizes Too.  The both have the 'in between cups'.|`|TFj6Z9Usaa	i would just leave it.<br>  i was like that. i slowly grew into it.<br>  if you feel comfertable leave it. if you want it closer than get smaller|`|6pZAs2Q4aa	I say stick with 36B because wearing a bra thats to small can prevent growth xxxxxx|`|T5hXbGSuaa	Show pictures for me to determine|`|RIpyjQ4waa	36A should work for you.

AA10849332	what gauge are you currently at?<br>  <br>  I get the impression from your question that you have never stretched before and are probably going to be skipping a lot of gauges to get to a 6. If this is not the case, sorry. but I know from doing it three times that the stretch from 8 to 6 is not easy so I can only imagine how bad it would be when skipping sizes.<br>  <br>  using a water based lubricant isn't going to hurt anything, but make sure you steer clear of oil based ones and that you wash your ears after stretching.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Don't use a lubricant just use saline solution or bactine or just do it in the shower|`|vCSQnIlRaa	a&d ointment, jojoba oil, emu oil those are my favorites. If your not already at an 8 and haven't waited at least 2 months I would advice you not to do it. As you get into the larger gauges the jumps get larger. If you create to much scar tissue now you'll just have problems stretching them in the future.|`|eEznnpnVaa	Um, you shouldn't use a lubricant when stretching, especially not something petroleum based.

9ddOWVqwaa	Hi<br>   ok the First thing is that what you need to do is get a hair stripping kit. What that does it strips your color off because it bleaches it. Now when you do that.it'll look orange or yellow..but don't be alarmed because that's what its suppose to do.<br>  Depending on how long your hair is and how thick you may need to boxes.<br>  Then right after your hair dries..get a box of the hair color you desire..that may also take 2 boxes..but it will help and depending on what color you choose..it shouldn't become yellow or orange.<br>  after all of this id suggest getting a hot oil treatment.<br>  because doing this can really damage your hair..those cost like 2 dollars..so it shouldn't be too expensive..the stripping kits cost around 10-15.and depending on your box of color your use could be 5-15..so it is a little expensive but it's WAY cheaper than a salon.<br>  i hope this helps alot!<br>  and i hope your hair turns out the way you want<br>  :)|`|0UOHex1Maa	I know it's alot easier to do it yourself at home, but seriously, I wouldn't do it.<br>  The boxes even say that if you're going to dye your hair a different color, make sure it's about a 2-color difference, which in your case is NOT.<br>  I tried to do the same to my hair and it honestly turned the UGLIEST color orange you'd ever seen!<br>  <br>  I suggest finding a GOOD hairstylist who is cheaper.<br>  Good luck! :)|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	Well I hated dying my hair and personally I just grew out my hair, and kept getting a hair cut so I could get rid of the color that was in my hair. Anyway you have some options. To just stick it out and just wait for your hair to grow and just cut off the stuff every month or so.<br>  Which is a lot longer and may not be as expensive. Or, you could get it done correctly by a trusted hair stylist that knows how to color. And if she makes it orange or brassy don't tell her you like it and leave.. Make sure you tell her that you want it re-done (because you paid a good amount of money and you don't need to walk around like that).<br>  Your hair stylist should re-book you for another time to come in and fix what you dislike. Its up to you. If you do it yourself you'll end up either trashing your hair or end up with discolored hair.<br>  I think you should take your chances with the hair dresser. At least she'll redo it if she messes up. It'll be a whole hell of a mess if you did it yourself and went in to have them fix it.

NLO8gv5caa	aw man, i have the EXACT SAME hair! it's very thick, curly, poofy, frizzy, and just plain unmanageable.  and having it look nice while its curly is very difficult to manage. i straightened my hair a lot to, but it mostly ended up on the top of my head. i eventually got sick of it so now i have a fab pixie cut, but i would not suggest doing that unless you are very sure that that is EXACTLY what you want. i would suggest olive oil treatments. once a week, massage your scalp with extra virgin olive oil, then comb it through your hair. leave it be for around an hour or two, then shampoo out without using conditioner. it helps to heal damaged hair, makes your hair look shiny and healthy, and it feels great. also, try getting your hair thinned to get rid of some of that thick hair, and trimmed because they could just be split ends. if they're not split ends, then again, break out the extra virgin, and soak your ends. using olive oil is fabulous and cheap, and its natural as well, which is always good. if you don't want to use olive oil, then redken shampoo and conditioner are excellent. they are a bit expensive but its totally worth it. <br>  <br>  lol, sorry, i know this is kind of long, but i hope it helped!<br>  :)|`|ESAMvi4taa	You should learn how to make your curls glossy and shiny and healthy.

Prenatal vitamins are something that you can take that are good for your hair and nails.|`|1OMpG5cPaa	What for ?<br>  They are dead anyhow :)<br>  Good hairstylist is your help who could cut your hair that you could gain selfestime and start liking your self the way how nature wants  you to be :)|`|WQV4cfSuaa	A great conditioner is the herbal essences "drama clean" conditoner, it immediatly makes you hair silky smooth. Also, bead head "moisture maniac" shampoo will get rid of the dry hay look. You can find both of those things at target. They aren't too pricey though. good luck :)|`|JO11r0Pcaa	I have the same problem...<br>   and I want to know too :)
MJI8murVaa	not so bad but the height seems a bit too high....<br>  why don't you sell some series that ladies could wear everyday ~ more casual type. that's my comments|`|zzxmSfBDaa	I think some of the shoes are cute... Im not sure what shoes retail for over in IL, but for the NY area that would be pricey for "all man made material" <br>  <br>  Good luck, I also know a few wholesale spots you can order from (online) with very good prices... I will send you a msg on myspace (wink)|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	they look good they look similar to victoria secret shoe but they alittle bit pricey but I think you need to put what people like and not what you like,because not everyone can walk in high heels|`|vFL1H4s1aa	They are good and i couldn't make anything like that. <br>  <br>  But they arn't really to my taste to be honest. They look a bit cheap and tacky. Im not being snobbish coz i only buy cheap shoes but I wouldn't buy them personally. <br>  <br>  Soryy, but im being honest.
kUhcypC9aa	You should wear a bit of mascara and a bit of eyeliner on the bottom, inner eye and some nude/rose lip colour with a bit of gloss. Everything I just said will keep it natural and that's obviously the way he likes it. I wouldn't bother with face make up unless you feel like you desperately need it to feel more confident.<br>  <br>  Keep your hair how you normally wear it because you don't want to look as though you are trying too hard, so again, as with the make up, I would keep your hair natural and how you feel happy with it.<br>  <br>  Wear what you feel confident wearing because there is nothing worse than not being happy with clothes etc. A safe bet would be some nice jeans with a plain black (fitted) top.<br>  <br>  When you see him be friendly and confident and chatty but not too in his face, act like you normally would etc because so far it seems like it has worked for you by doing it this way. <br>  <br>  Lastly dont be dis-heartened if he rejects you, he might just be taken aback a bit and shocked.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun :) x|`|aDG8EteIaa	I say skip on the makeup if he's said that, maybe do your hair niceley (perhaps like Helena's ^_^) and wear whatever outfit you feel most confident in.<br>  <br>  Good luck ^_^|`|dXdgS7e2aa	just mascara to be safe, maybe cover up & just be cool, don't ask him on a date just ask if he wants to kick it some time and give him your number .
RcBkUBsfaa	they do have a concealer....<br>  i use it and its great!!!!|`|6p5IK0kcaa	i dont use bare minerals because im a guy, but i know many ppl that do and it works out great for them. you should try it for yourself and see what you think
eeNWU321aa	I know nothing about that but I do know that panel-style judging is where you have a few different judges who make decisions together. :)
5j0qSHXjaa	No!!! not at all that is even more sexy, I am a huge fan of high heels ana I am already tall I am 5'6 and when I wear heels I am the tallest tree out here... but I love it so much... You are going to look fabulous if you wear a pair of heels my mother is 5'10 and she wears heels and when she puts them on she reminds me of a barbie doll strut your height woman...|`|vHUkEqbuaa	I'm 5'7 and never wear heels because it makes me way taller then all my friends (granted all my friends are short). I think it really depends on how you feel being that tall. It also depends on the height of the heel...|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	You can never be too tall to wear heels :)  Unless you are with a shorter guy and he asks you to wear smaller heels|`|4Pguvjyraa	IF YOU FEEL GOOD WEARING HEELS YOU SHOULD WEAR THEM. I DONT THINK YOU ARE TOO TALL! ALL MODELS WEAR HEELS AND THEY LOOK GREAT.|`|UoqJtQ8Oaa	I am this tall and if I wear high heels it looks horrible. Men hate it when women are taller than them.. so I don't wear them.|`|VGhmc0dOaa	nah, you're really tall, but you're not a giant. It's ok for you to wear them.|`|Y9I3Bxkbaa	Cmon wear them, U WILL LOOK LIKE A SEXY model!!!!|`|1ZfFSH6maa	everyone can wear heels :)|`|xxSGhywoaa	no.  I think anybody can wear heels.  It's a good way to keep posture.|`|mDt03eXIaa	I don't think you;re too tall for them, but it depends on what you feel comfortable with. I'm 5'8, and I only wear heels if I'm with tall people lol, just because I don't like feeling like I'm head and shoulders above everyone else. But, I have a friend who in flats is 6 feet tall, and she regularly wears heels and loves it. It's totally your call. To answer your question, though, no you aren't too tall for heels.|`|twWQwax9aa	I wish I was taller but I'm only 5'2! <br>  <br>  You should be confident and embrace your height! At least you'll stand out in a crowd!<br>  <br>  All I get is aww you're so sweet, you're so cute or you're just like a little doll! <br>  Patronising!! <br>  <br>  So YES wear heels your heels with pride!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|wOGUL6v6aa	Not at all. I am 5 - 7 and wear a 4" heel and I love it.|`|Um8G2ZS3aa	no
0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	I would wear a bra. But if you have thicker clothing, then you can probably pull it off. Wear one if you have thin clothing.|`|AsQkzj3daa	its bad to be bra less, or not wear a bra at all when you get boobs. so, i think you should just wear a bra in the day, take it off at night, and don't wear shirts that are way to tight to keep the nipples from sticking out:) i hope this helped....|`|4sW8MFxCaa	don't get cold|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Well if you don't have a bra you boobs will start to sag, even though they are an A cup. If you go out occasionally without a bra use Petals. They look like little cut out flowers. You can get them at target. They just stick on to the nipple and prevent it from them popping out of the shirt.|`|u6HndVxaaa	doesnt matter wear a bra. braless makes you look slutty and careless about your body<br>  WEAR A BRA|`|yje6VNCpaa	i wouldn't.<br>  i think it looks weird.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	get tanks with built in bras|`|PMuAITczaa	Dont get too cold :P<br>  But i think you should wear a bra, just because they may be quite small doesnt mean you shouldnt wear one, and you dont want saggy boobs now do you? ;]<br>  But i suppose wearing NON-see through tops would help :P|`|4af7b1e055fcc07f742201869b6bf138aa	If people are telling you you can get away with going bra-less, you'd probably look great that way. Poking nipples are very cute on small breasts. Looking natural is what the bra-less look is all about. Have fun!|`|PTshTOSUaa	get those flower petals to cover ur nipples, theyre beige and in the shape of flowers and just stick on. sell them prob at walmart and target, deffinitly at harmon.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	You could at that size.<br>  <br>  However, unless you wear heavy fabrics, you can't fight the nipples without a bra.|`|NQI1YnNGaa	if you wear two cammis or a thinker shirt your perfectly fine.<br>  (:<br>  good luck|`|mS2ZFHpYaa	wear a bra it makes your boobs bigger ...|`|SS87lbOCaa	i think it looks nasty!|`|5EPwDjt8aa	My wife is the same size and doesn't need a bra.<br>  I don't think you would have any problems, but you can wear pull over blouses if you are really afraid of someone seeing your nipples.|`|0O0lnEgWaa	I am very small too. Probably the same size. I wear camis(from aeropostal) they work. Make sure u wear a shirt over it too(not white). Your situation is the same as mone but as i said u can use a cami.|`|2fYyw4LBaa	The bra less look whether you have small boobs or not is trashy! Especially if your nipples poke though... extremely trashy... not to mention wouldn't you be embarrassed?? Hmm|`|JzdslIkDaa	yes you can go braless in tank tops|`|GJKhzZZiaa	i'm smaller than that and I wouldn't think about going braless keep it on honey, trust
mJbwemH8aa	When it comes to bars, always put it back from the same area that u took it off, clean it well after removing the old one and then put the new one.<br>  <br>  .|`|bAYVSfdJaa	It doesn't matter, but if you're worried about it closing, follow the old jewelry with the new one.  Like, take one of the balls off, and push the old jewelry out with the new one.|`|e9gsf1GJaa	balls, HAHHA.<br>  rook piercings are scary,<br>  its like close to your brain.<br>  BUT going from the top is easier,<br>  and it depends on how old the piercing is,<br>  BE SURE NOT TO SCRAPE YOUR INSIDES!<br>  it can cause rash infections.
YhnY09JQaa	Honestly.Yes. <br>  BUT, <br>  Because it doesn't really look like you put any on the top lid. If you want to keep with what you have on the bottom lid, put some on your top lid to even things out. But if you don't feel comfortable then just put some on your bottom lid, but cut back a bit.<br>  <br>  Here is a video on how to apply a little bit of liner, but makes a great difference. It also shows how to put different kinds of liner on: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1hc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1...</a><br>  I honestly swear by this girl who does these tutorial makeup videos, always has something new. Check out the rest of her videos for some more makeup looks!:)<br>  <br>  Have fun, and experiment with a little bit less eyeliner:)<br>  Jenna|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	ya, way too much.  you look beat up and worn out.|`|rbv59Hwaaa	yes!! you've got a lot of eyeliner on the bottom lid and it doesn't look like you've got any on the top|`|DFwvcUnhaa	Way too much eye liner on your lower eyelids. The rest is ok.|`|QRn984YPaa	Yeahh . Its unequal with the top =/|`|aDG8EteIaa	Yeah, a bit too much eyeliner|`|AA10451868	What the... some kinda joke?|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	Lining the bottom of your eyes heavily actually has the effect of making your eyes appear smaller. You should use liquid eyeliner (or pencil) on the top. You will notice a massive improvment. :)|`|NtAuguxEaa	Yeah, too much eyeliner, it looks like it's been really badly edited on paint or something. Try using a browner eyeliner or just try using less :)|`|MkgXSlljaa	ehh not really . i know people that wear a lot more . i think it looks fine|`|BREi7qw7aa	uh yahh.. you have none on the top, way to much on bottom.. go easy on the eyeliner..|`|BUApA0R7aa	yes|`|KDXisAOlaa	yep|`|wyNVJXUiaa	yes|`|eqCfPDpRaa	yeah .. too much eyeliner .. try a thinnner line of it and itll be perfect ;]|`|SccU9zdNaa	Lol, just a tad. You could probably get away with a little less and if you stop a little before your eyelashes actually stop, then it doesn't look like a football player *sorry, its what everyone reminds me of when they have to dark of eyeliner* also, black is the worst color of eye liner on anybody. But thats just my opinion. Do what you want. After all, your make up should reflect you, not a whole bunch of people online you have never met|`|6SqxGQsqaa	too much makeup? your only wearing eyeliner on the bottom, and the line is way  too thick. even it out, or apply some shadow at least|`|KQmUzi5paa	Yes. Tone down the eyeliner.|`|9Wn9cE8Paa	You must know the answer---seeing as you are asking the question.|`|p2HIPtsSaa	Yes|`|VbeDUoIsaa	a little|`|NLO8gv5caa	yeah. there's a bit to much on the bottom.

It isn't like you ate TEN of them. Come on...seriously? Everyone can treat themselves once in a while. It's not like that ONE cream cake is going to make you fat, because it WON'T. So please...don't worry about it. Don't make yourself throw up...don't.

Anyways, I hope I helped...:) xxx|`|u6HndVxaaa	its fine to have a little treat once and awhile, one little fatty thing wont turn you into a fat whale. itll make you feel fat tho, but work out and for a while and it all goes away and you feel all buff.<br>  <br>  DONT PURGE as you could a serious eating disorder. my friend was just like you and she stared becoming anorexic so we got her help from a guidance counsellar and shes STILL in the hospital recovering, we miss her so much|`|yje6VNCpaa	NO!<br>  you'll be fine, geez.<br>  just don't do it again..<br>  <br>  and maybe go to a psychiatrist<br>  <br>  if this is even real.|`|kUhcypC9aa	You will be fine :) x|`|Isi8ElyWaa	dont even worry about that, its good, youve boosted your energy so tommorow when you wake up you will be really energetic and, diets generally make you lose energy so exercise really hard tommorow, i hope you are exercising and not just expecting to lose weight by just eating less or having a healthy diet, to lose the weight you have to exercise, and i hope you are not starving yourself, you should be eating 6 meals a day with loads of protien and everything else well balanced, and do good exercise and you will drop the weight off just like that, if you really think you are fat, maybe you should search how to lose pure fat, its takes alot of commitment, all of the good diets tell you to eat things to boost your energy levels up and by the way stick skinny girls are not the prettiest, being slim but having nice curves and shape to your body is liked a lot more, stick skinny can look quite little girlish to me.|`|SHanivxvaa	You let it digest it won,t make you fat you would only be putting on weight if you was eating at least 2200 cals or more and even then if you ate 2200 a day that would only be half a stone in a year if and still that's only if your lazy and you sit down a lot don,t worry about silly things|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Find out how many calories then find out how much exercise to do to burn the calories. i do that now it's saving my teeth from purging myself plus I have like one bathroom and I can't use it everytime cuz people just walk in. go exercise.|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Go work out.

eqCfPDpRaa	whell .... i  really liked that orange shirt from hollister .. it was striped .. and it was under 'tees' .. put that with some darker colored jeans and your short brown boots .. that would look nice .. and if u have to add a cami .. put a white lacy one .. oh add a necklase ... anddd maybe a matching bracelet (silver of course) .. if u dont have the accesories then fine .. but that would look good :]|`|Tx96cpvvaa	when you go shopping you have a bit of a color scheme so that everything can be interchangeable. Too many colors were in your wardrobe that didn't go with anything else. I see you like color but be able so wear that one shirt with 5 different pants and same with the hoodies.

eqxUxVnxaa	Ok Ive had a friend who did this before it took forever but it looked so cool and so hott when she got it finished. She did tips of her hair though. Ok first you need to die your hair one solid color. Like black. Ok once you have done that and it has been washed and completely dried you need to take the strips of hair that you want a diff color and bleach them. They will turn Blonde or white. But anyways if you want to do it right you have to bleach the spots you want a diff color otherwise the colors just won't look right when you just add them to black or anyother color it looks stupid. It doesnt show up that well. Ok once your hair is bleached in the spots you want, let it set for a while then take the 2nd color you said you wanted blue or something. Dye the bleached hair that color. And enjoy.<br>  <br>  ( its hard to do bc when you bleach your hair you have to make sure you don't get it in any other spot besides the spot or spots your dying a 2nd color. and also you have to be carefull when you dye your hair a 2nd color too. Making sure that dye does not get in your non bleached hair) <br>  <br>  Anyways good luck im sure you will look Awesome when it is done.|`|HB3fDXeMaa	leave the abnormal hair color to the pros or else you'll severely regret it.....as well I once tried to highlight my own hair and it turned out like crap - so leave that to the pros too.
V3FQRtqFaa	I'm 31- <br>  But honestly, there isnt enough information.  Is this 40-year old fit and wearing brand name jeans with his hair styled fashionably- basically pulled together in every other way?  The shirt is distressed to look old but not ratty? Then I would say this guy was very much a metrosexual trying to be ironic.  Good for a fling but nothing serious.<br>  <br>  Now if we are talking about a flabby guy wearing dirty jeans and sneakers with the laces coming undone and a 3-day beard growth then I would wonder what made him come away from his PS3.<br>  <br>  <br>  And yes, I am using extreme stereotypes to get the point across.|`|s30Duwdraa	It depends.  <br>  <br>  If he has kids, going to the park or is doing work around the house or something, that's fine.<br>  <br>  But if he goes on a date or some kind of an event wearing it, i would think LOOOOOOOOOSER who still lives with his mom, sucks his bong and plays video games. <br>  <br>  I am in my early 30s (thanks for the reminder!)|`|WiSlOcBraa	hell no that is really stupid ewwwwwwww|`|s3YuchHoaa	It depends on his vibe more than his clothes. I think your clothing is a form of representation but it doesn't define you.I would be reluctant to date a man who is 40 because of the stipulations envolved with dating an older man . I would be weary of his motives being I am 20.If I got along with him on a multitude of levels however age is unimportant.|`|QMbxBynZaa	well im fifteen, but i think if a guy MY age dressed that way i'd be iffy about dating him, so i think that gives you an answer right there.|`|Ujxrpoonaa	I wouldnt date a man that wore a spiderman or batman shirt if he were 40 or 20...|`|XCtKpwkwaa	he has to be gay<br>  <br>  im 21|`|eybiUyz3aa	i'm half that age, so i wouldn't date someone forty anyway...but frankly, i wouldn't really care as long as he doesn't look like a slob.  you see, a good looking man who is fairly fit can wear a spider/batman tshirt and not look stupid...but if a hairy, smelly, fat guy with a bushy, runaway beard wears it, it's kinda disgusting.|`|wdONLcNeaa	oh christ he's prob one of those middle-aged lost boys who never grew up, don't date him. he must have comic book collections older than you lol.<br>  <br>  btw im 24|`|C1imDsmbaa	probably some mid-aged dad with 3 little boys whom he influenced Marvel on.

Then take off the glove and put some tan on the back of your hand & rub the backs of your hands together! <br>  (I use a baby wipe/cleansing wipe then to clean the palms of my hands afterwards-just incase) <br>   No orange palms anymore!

Marketing - Nike is one classic example, they get some sexy celeb sports star to inject the brand with cool/classy image, pay him or her a fortune - consumer in turn wants to be cool/classy and so buys the garment at a huge cost - BUT the garment was made for pennies by some lowly poorly paid worker in the third world.  The idea it is a designer brand is all pie in the sky.<br>  <br>  2.  However, so clever is marketing we all then in turn judge people by the choices they make - Nike top = cool/classy or whatever.<br>  <br>  3.  As well as giving each other a thumbs up (due to all the mags, marketing, ads etc) we can also give each other a thumbs down, meaning there is also a negative brought into the whole what you wear category... so to what extent is something a choice when there are negative consequences (ie ridicule at not having the expensive trainers - even though they are made from same materials and sometimes even in same factory!!) for not doing it?  Brands rely on us to police each other..you even see mags with big ticks or crosses against a celeb outfit... WHO CARES!? - except the gullible, vaccuous or shallow minded>?<br>  <br>  I however say sod all that!  Really, it never bothers me what someone is wearing - clothes are there for a purpose not so I can be brainwashed by brands or fashion designers.. equally I do not give a hoot what anyone thinks of my own dress sense - I own 3 pairs of shoes which must be a record for a female - it makes no sense to me to try and get societal cudos points from being a waling mannequin.. <br>  <br>  Instead I would rather be judged on who I am.. this philosophy has stood me in great stead, had many marriage proposals, have lovely pals, great family etc etc - so the bottom line is if a person does not keep pace with his or her companions perhaps it is because they hear a different drummer..<br>  <br>  So work on who you are not what you - or anyone else for that matter is wearing..|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Jean Seberg inspires me :]<br>  <a href="http://stylehighclub.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/jean_seberg_8212.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://stylehighclub.files.wordpress.com...</a><br>  And Audrey Hepburn too.<br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TAQLl2xaO_0/R9tP5oEd8LI/AAAAAAAAAK8/mRLKPWLkd4A/s400/Audrey%2BHepburn1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TAQLl2xaO_0/R9...</a><br>  They are such classy ladies :]|`|qYPCkscTaa	Mostly I just go by what my mood is, otherwise, I like Demi Lovato and (sometimes) Miley's clothes, whent their not slutty.|`|qv3W0MDJaa	These aren't my personal styles,but i do think they have good taste:-<br>  LC<br>  Aly and AJ<br>  Selena Gomez|`|2pwIT6TXaa	Kate Moss & Nicole Richie.|`|AA12129792	Charity shops and special offers.

The trauma that your hair is going through just for one process is bad enough but to rush and fix it up will just cause unwanted damage.  Ash is a very tricky color to work with.

dq2FWlebaa	I have the same problem!<br>  First of all, a few helpful products are:<br>  - a shampoo for oily hair<br>  -a balancing conditioner<br>  -a boar bristle brush (when brushing hair, this distributes the oils evenly, taking it away from the scalp.)<br>  - Household flour! <br>  <br>  1. Shampoo hair with warm water and rinse completely. Excess product will add to your hairs greasiness. <br>  2. Condition only from the middle of your hair down. Leave on for 2 minutes, then rinse with cool water. Cool water closes your hair's cuticle leaving it shiny and harder for grease to be produced. <br>  3. When your hair starts to get greasy, sprinkle a little amount of flour on your roots, and lightly rub in. The flour absorbs grease.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! <br>  :)|`|AV0eejfLaa	Try Ojon dry shampoo u can get it at sephora it works really good.

See I am a dance instructor and I work for an advertising company. So I wash my hair in the morning, go to work for the ad company, then go to work at the dance studio. Often, I like to go out to eat after work, but after working all day then dancing in the evening, my hair looks like a grease ball. So here is my trick, you take either baby powder, after shower powder, or even medicated body powder, and apply it to your scalp, pretty thick, and brush it in. Let it sit for a few then take a towel and rub it in your hair, like you were towel drying it. The problem is, powder will make your hair stand up like a frizzy mess, so after you do the powder, take a dryer sheet and run it through your hair. It will make it shiny and smell good, and it won't be all frizzed out and greasy! It only takes like 5 minutes. Good Luck!|`|SccU9zdNaa	Most people at that age have very oily hair. Just have to live with it. I have oily hair as well. <br>  avoid serums and hair putty, and try not to put anything on your scalp. <br>  Get your hair off your face and neck!!! not only does it trap in oils and transfer oil from skin to hair and hair to skin, it is very likely to cause acne.<br>  try tea-tree oil. I don't like the smell, but it works REALLY well.<br>  if you use conditioner, use it only on the ends, never on your scalp.<br>  <br>  you may just have to wait it out. thats what most have to do. good luck|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	batiste dry shampoo<br>  it's really good|`|h7ydm1graa	get some dry shampoo.|`|9q83AhnMaa	I had to wash my hair every day aswell. this was because i was using the wrong shmapoo. Use head&shoulders shampoo because it really works. I useed it because i had greasy hair and i had to wash it every day and now i can wash it every 2 or even 3 days! Trust me. head&shoulders is the best shampoo for greasy hair. And 1 more tIP. iF the shampoo fell greasy then it will make your hair greasy and if it dont feel that greasy (like head&shoulders shampoo) then it will be good for greasy hair. good luck|`|U5V2QPSmaa	1.  Shampoo with lukewarm or cool water and avoid hot temperatures.<br>  2.  Use products that are advertised as clarifying or oil controlling.<br>  3.  Shampoo every day, if necessary, to minimize oil buildups.<br>  4.  Layer shampoo appropriately.  Use oil removal products only on the scalp but layer moisture enhancing or body building products on the middle and ends.<br>  5.  Focus oil removal shampoo products only on the scalp area.  Avoid applying to the middle or ends of the hair where natural oil is needed.<br>  6.  Never pile wet strands on top of the head.  This can transfer oil and grease from the scalp to the rest or the hair.<br>  7.  Always finish each shampoo with a cool/cold water rinse which will help cut down on the natural oil production.<br>  8.  In between shampoo sessions, use cornstarch, cornmeal, dry shampoo or blotting skin papers to remove excessive oil that builds up.  <br>  <br>  Do not use talc, baby powder or related types of powders that can contain chemicals that can be toxic to the lungs.<br>  <br>  9.  Wear hair up and off from the face whenever possible.  Skin oils can easily be transferred via the tresses to the scalp and vice versa.  This only makes the situation worse.<br>  10.  Never brush hair other than to lightly style.  Brushing hair can stimulate the sebaceous glands and carry excessive oils throughout the rest of the strands.

7d2e1c957453fc8d4829969618e83382aa	General consensus of guys says ... absolutely!<br>  <br>  If you want hardcore proof on it, take this for example: There's something called Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR), which pretty much is a number standing for how curvy a girl is in the hips. To get this number, you take your waist size in inches or centimeters, and divide it by your hip size in inches or centimeters. For example, here's my WHR calculation:<br>  <br>  23.5in / 34 in = .69<br>  <br>  What that means is that my hips are .69 times bigger than my waist. The lower the number, the bigger the curves! Now, I don't know what the average WHR is, unfortunately, but it's been proven that girls with lower WHRs are perceived as more attractive to men. The "ideal" WHR is .7, although I personally think the most gorgeous figures around .65 or .6!<br>  <br>  The great thing about WHR is that it doesn't take your weight into consideration. Regardless how big or small you may be, it ONLY measures your curves! Like with my numbers, I'm a thin girl, but I have an "ideal" curve in my hips, which guys love.  :)<br>  <br>  There's also bust-waist ratio, and of course guys love higher BWRs because that means bigger boobs! Put them together and you see that guys prefer bigger boobs, smaller waists, and bigger hips. Which equals ... curves!!<br>  <br>  So all that to say that YES, it is scientifically proven that guys prefer curvy girls! Which is fabulous, because little skinny girls look more and more sickly as time goes on, and it's getting old! So rock them curves, girl!  ;)|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	Depends on how you are defining curvy. Fat is not curvy and you are not fat so I'm assuming you have a decent pair of breasts a defined waist and hips? I don't think men care so much about size but more about the quality of what you actually have. I would rather be a size 10-12 with a nice body than a size 6 with no **** waist or ***. You sound good to me :) I like slim and curvy, not skinny and not fat.|`|Isi8ElyWaa	everytime anyone mentions curvy everyone assumes that persons fat, curvy is like, beyonce, shakira, mariah carey, jennifer lopez, kim kardashian and they all are beautiful! everyone loves there bodies, young guys in there teens like stick thin girls that because they are stick thin boys that look like a shaven bird, and they dont like curvy girls because they look older and 'bigger' than them. ive always been curvy, i have always had big breasts and hips and a bum that sticks out, and my waist has been nice and slim ( i kept it in shape by working on it) and when i was younger i found that the really skinny short guys liked the skinny short girls but the slim tall guys like tall curvy girls tallish girls, young boys feel really threatened when a girl is taller than them,i was 5'9 or 5'10 in school and all the boys hated it that i was taller than them, because they felt really minature and child like next to me and they admitted that too, anyway ive kind of drifted off subject now, but yeah i prefer curves!! (not because i have them but they look a lot more elegant to me)|`|EnYKNyPxaa	personal preference really. im uk 10 top and 8 bottom, but i look smaller, im more wide sideways but thinner, and small built. iv had people say im skinny and thin, but never had a problem with it, i am thin but i have curves, no bones poking out anywhere, so i dont know wether im curvy or skinner or what ever but anyyywaaayyy, personal preference, if the man didnt like it they wouldnt be there. :)|`|NPhepcBkaa	I'm a size 8-10 uk and I'm on a diet because teenage boys prefer skinny girls. adult men prefer curves as they are more mature and attracted to womanly women but teenage boys tend to go for the thin girls, i see. its not right but its true. not for all boys though!<br>  xXx<br>  oh and its a us 6-8|`|8Pf65Bxjaa	well f.e. my boyfriend says that if i became, let say - curvier i'd have to go jogging every morning till i was back fit<br>  but i believe there are guys that like big girls, so it depends (look at his mum and that's mostly what type of women he will be in)|`|9CMGO5fhaa	I'm the same size almost cuz I'm still losing a lot of wieght and probably I might be smaller anyways I have great Italian looks guys that I am with love my body. be confident and it will not even matter though! I would say curvy.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Not this guy|`|XkWTsyJdaa	depends on the guy. its fine if ur curvy, just not gross fat. like whitney from americas next top model. she was so pretty and she was very curvy, plus sized, but she had rly pretty skin and her body wasnt gross at all. she still looked fit.|`|ftmmWpqbaa	A size 10 - 12 in the UK, is a size 6-8 in the US!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  That's absolutely fine. My friend is like that. She's 5"8, it suits her perfectly. SHe's curvy , but nowhere near fat!!!!<br>  She's pretty and confident and popular, and it has never stopped her from getting a boyfriend etc-.<br>  <br>  You are fine if that is a natural weight for you, sweetie. Don't fret!! xxxxxx|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Here's a way to answer your question. Take a look around a local area where young couples have married and started a family. Then draw your own conclusions. <br>  <br>  I have six young married couples on my street just starting off. Five of the women are curvy and one is skinny.|`|OvXqFJzMaa	hmm i'm every one is diffrent<br>  but its way better 2 be curvy than anorexic skinny<br>  toodlees|`|yje6VNCpaa	everyone guy is different. it<br>  just depends on the guy's <br>  mind. haha.

OHfZFR31aa	Barbizon is a school that accepts anyone willing to pay $1500-3000+. If you want to learn how to do your makeup, speak in public, and have a little fashion show for your family, then a school could be fun and a way to meet new people if your parents have money to spend. They are not an agency as they do not represent models and are not actively looking for jobs for you.<br>  <br>  But if you want to be a model, no school in the world can make you a model. You are better off sending in your pictures directly to top agencies like these <a href="http://models.com/agencies/top/" rel="nofollow">http://models.com/agencies/top/</a> and they will call you to come in to their office if you have the right look. Your only out of pocket expense will be your transportation to their office. They will not charge you to join, to take classes, etc. <br>  <br>  And you should know that the big agencies really look down on modeling schools and it's rare for them to sign anyone who says they went to school, mainly because most schools teach too many bad habits when it comes to posing and walking that you can't undo. The walks and poses they teach are more suited to beauty pageants than fashion.<br>  <br>  Also check to see who the teachers are at your school - what experience do they have in the modeling industry?|`|HeOwMaxaaa	no its not a scam...you take really useful classes about the modelling world... and every one thinks its a scam because it's not a modeling agency, its a MODELLING SCHOOL. not agency, get it right. thats why people keep saying omg its a scam bla bla! its not. you wanna go to a modelling school go to barbizon, if you want to go to a modelling agency go somewhere else. dont expect barbizon to give you modelling jobs ect.  although they have done so, they do represent some famous people.. like sean faris <3 they were the doors to make him famous you can go search for him they also say that barbizon did... but anyway its not a scam, if it was they would have sued the place and shut it down many, many years ago, considering that it opened like in the late 1940's<br>  Bye now! xoxo|`|bB5d5YVeaa	Barbizon has been around forever.  And, you might think that's a good thing...but I don't.  I recall hearing their advertisements on the local radio stations as far back as 30 years ago (yeah, I am THAT old).  Let's face it, any "modeling agency" that has to advertise on the radio is pretty pathetic.  Most models are "found".  You know, they win a beauty contest and someone at the event works for an agency and recommends the beauty queen to the management of the agency.<br>  <br>  I agree with what some others have said on here.  Barbizon will tell you that YES you too can be a model.  But, only after you pay them big money so they can teach you how to pose.  They'll let you pay and pay and pay for all sorts of photo shoots.  And even give you some nice glossy photos to keep.  (Not saying how vain that is.)<br>  <br>  Barbizon?  Don't bother.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I found this but I think its just someone who was mad because they weren't modeling quality. <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/076/RipOff0076036.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/07...</a> <br>  First off barbizon is not an agency, its a school to learn how to do what the agencies are looking for. Agencies are the people who hire models not train them. You will have to pay since it is a school. Its kinda like college for people who want to model or learn makeup artistry. Its a rough school and many people are not happy with it thats why they say its a scam. They will train you no matter what but they will tell you if you are runway quality or not.|`|UKGJxaoaaa	Yes it is a scam my friend went there and it cost her thousands|`|7d2e1c957453fc8d4829969618e83382aa	YES! Please don't enroll with Barbizon!<br>  <br>  They're not technically a modeling AGENCY, they're a modeling school that books their own students for photo shoots. Which means you'll pay a LOT of money to learn how to pose, do one or two photo shoots, and that'll be it. No more agency connections. No more photo shoots. No money paid for modeling.<br>  <br>  Please please please don't go to Barbizon! If you want to model for a legitimate agency, send your pictures to real agencies and NOT schools. You'll know you're with a real agency because they will NOT charge you up-front fees for learning how to pose, etc. There might be a small fee for your first photo shoot to get your portfolio/comp card together, but that's rare and small. You should not not not have to pay thousands of dollars to an agency!<br>  <br>  Try looking up local modeling agencies, or going to your nearest big fashion city (New York, Miami, Los Angeles, etc) to see if you can do some part-time modeling through them. But whatever you do, girl, do NOT go to a modeling school! A true agency will teach you whatever you need to know at no cost if they think you're able to make their company money.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|egOOi6Imaa	Oh yeah! If they are asking for more than 300 bucks for training don't do it cuz they just like to suck you in for the money and ur not even promised to get booked for a job=/<br>  <br>  If they REALLY want you. You don't have to pay more than what I said before for training.<br>  <br>  Try Caren. If they want you.  There is no such things as paying for it.|`|FPUgQnIFaa	Most are scams.<br>  I went for an interview to one and they wanted me to enroll in their $1000 modeling program...<br>  <br>  If an agency wants you...they won't ask you to put money towards a career--unless its a portfolio|`|e976dc07f72f05dae0fb41c58bbfd6b7aa	All reputable modelling agencies will never charge money for you to join them.<br>  <br>  Search of google for "List of Reputable Modelling Agencies"<br>  <br>  If it ain't on there...yup. It's a scam.|`|kUhcypC9aa	Scam :) x|`|FJswVeqbaa	it costs alot of money...wow|`|Sd0V2Sd9aa	I had a friend go there and it didn't last very long idk what really happened, but I suggest no.<br>  But I know If an agency ever asks you for money its a scam!

One in particular I saw on TV was that Angelina, and Nicole Kidman. Both different hair colours yet pale skin. Notice they both are beautiful women? They believe less is more. I do too. I sent my girls up the street for a make over at our local Shoppers Drug Mart..... I expected them to come home all different. The changes were subtle yet breath-taking. The lady did my blue eyed girl in pinks. She did my olive pale skin brown eyed girl in blue? I thought blue would not suit her. Wow they were gorgeous. For a fact too most men like their women without makeup.|`|C1dRwOWAaa	YouTube has lots of ideas :) I have really pale skin too, I would usually do a brown or black smokey eye and a nude lip, or a neuteral eye with a really dark lip!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|WtM9JnqYaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8OoJXNwRz8&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8OoJXNwR...</a><br>  <br>  AMAZING HELP!!<br>  <br>  WOW.|`|U5V2QPSmaa	For pale skin, i really love a peachy-cute blush right on the apples of your cheeks.

u4FGBKi4aa	It is a real skill....
EUNw2ufSaa	Add mouse, gel and hairspray then simply scrunch with your hand or a diffuser. If you want it without using products try braiding it after a shower and leaving it till it dries. Braid depending on how big the waves you want. Obviously one big braid equals bigger waves. 2 braids equal wavier.|`|V7iDTULQaa	Yea if you want wavy hair thats what my mom used to do when I was little. Shed braid it before I went to sleep while it was still wet. You might wanna use a couple of braids and not just a french so you get even amounts.|`|6pUbLMhpaa	if u french braid it and use the salt water it will just make it look more shiny and not as staticky|`|i7nEgSW1aa	Put your hair in the ocean and the waves should go into your hair|`|53uOSbZLaa	Not so sure I'd put salt in my hair. Salt has drying properties to it, so if you do that a lot, it could damage your hair by drying it out too much. <br>  <br>  If you braid your hair when it's wet and allow it to dry well, that should be plenty enough without using salt water. <br>  <br>  You can also use a gel when blow drying, and just scrunch handfuls of  your hair as you dry it to get a nice loose, wavy look. The gel should help the style last all day.|`|1PsQjMUcaa	Try it one night when u either know you don't have to go anywhere that day or u don't need your hair looking that good|`|4uKbpwVtaa	scrunch it and put hair spray and gell in it. i've never tried that but it might work. it sounds like it could. if you braid it when it's wet and sleep in it and take it out in the morning it will be wavy but i'm not sure about the salt water part.|`|B9fwuaSlaa	Braid it into about 1/4 inch thick braids and blow dry it on the cold setting. If you have a lot of time, braid it, blow dry it and let it settle for about 3 hours then blow dry on the cold setting again then slowly take the braids out. Make sure your hair is wet first. Salt will dry your hair.
20b4pc5Raa	as i recall, the lip hurts more than the eyebrow. but who cares about pain if you like something?|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	the lip doesn′t hurt a lot but the eyebrow yeah because the skin is more thick I really cry.|`|j8yZjWqDaa	well i don't have those pierced but had friends that did. everyone tells me that the lip isn't bad at all. eyebrow is probably going to hurt more but you really can't go by anyone's opinion because everyone's tolerance for pain is different so just go and find out! and when you're both done, you can ask your friend, on the scale of one to ten how much it hurts and your friend can ask you the same thing. then you'll know who is in more pain. good luck!

mJbwemH8aa	You go to any beauty care shop and ask for something clearing natural cream based on  the type of yr skin: ex- dry, mixed or oily. with a soap and that would help u, plus DO NOT TOUCH the pimple.<br>  <br>  .|`|dB3bmk3Faa	I didn't have acne scars, but I fell and gashed my face pretty deep above my top lip and it left a ugly dark purple scar. I went to the store and bought Mederma scar ointment and it is literally almost completely gone. No one notices it and it was a deep scar. So maybe you should try that instead of bleaching. There are alot of over the counter scar ointments and lotions.|`|jzSx5kAxaa	That's intriguing...i remember a soap that did the same thing and it certainly ligtens the area but i would perfer you use makeup to hide it like most girls do...who know what the chemicals in the agents are doing to your face...could lead to premature aging wrinkles in the process of ligenting the area.

The gun can send little shocks into the cartilage and damage your ear.<br>  <br>  For the best answer, speak with a trained a licences piercer. They will usually have kits and pamphlettes for you to read.<br>  <br>  These piercings usually hurt, quite a bit, so you might want to put "fake piercings" in that place for a day or two to see if you like it and are willing to endure the pain, cleaning, etc.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	A piercing studio!

adyNCp6eaa	You are probably becoming a teenager early. When you are a teenager, your hair gets greasy faster, so you have to shower every day instead of every other day. That will probably make things better. Hope I helped!<br>  * rEdhEAd&prOUd*|`|xxSGhywoaa	It seems that you will have to get new stuff as the shampoo you are using is what is keeping your hair greasy.|`|zzbyelzkaa	Make sure that when you are putting conditioner in your hair, that you don't massagee it into your scalp. only condition the tips of your hair. This helped me alot. Also I would get a different shampoo and conditioner like herbal essences or loreal vive. Those are both good.|`|sS65j9Wraa	i don't really have greasy hair but after i have been using the same shampoo for a while it becomes less effective..!! So change your shampoo and if it is still greasy in between washes try dry shampoo<br>  like 'Batiste Tropical', its the best one on the market and only costs 2 pounds!! (from boots) and has a really nice coconuty smell and lifts roots and rids them of grease!! magic ;-)<br>  xxx|`|5UEugyzvaa	I had that same problem, I just simply quit using conditioner. It helped my hair alot, but every week I put conditioner at the ends of my hair.

Try using L'oreal Elvive. It is in a pink bottle and says for greasy hair or something - i use it every other day and it lasts! It is really good!
xU8ovpD8aa	Taller girls are normally chosen as models,  but honestly height for girls does not really matter as long as they are shorter then you.  I am 6'4 and I have dated girls that were 5'11, and others that were 5'1.  I actually like shorter girls because they look so delicate.|`|4sW8MFxCaa	no|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	i'm almost 5'9'' and i've always thought that shorter girls are way cuter.|`|of049X1waa	tall girls look more like models, because all models have to be tall, but I think that guys prefer short girls... as long as you're proportionate it doesn't matter how tall you are!|`|yje6VNCpaa	i think short people are pretty too.lol.<br>  i'm turning 13 in two weeks and i'm 5'6.|`|Hie2Dx5baa	no... i think shorter girls are prettier a lot of the time.|`|SS87lbOCaa	HELL NO...HEIGHT DONT MATTER!

Heck, Short girls are just as cute as tall girls!
jez0O0bXaa	Only wash when really needed and leave in the conditioner.  There is no natural oils so you need to replenish it.

3PiIh7Qiaa	there is good chance at haming your hair<br>  what you need to do is get Paul Mitchell Hair Repair Treatment  <br>  this stuff will repair your hair from you last dye protect it when you strip it and it cost about $10 for 3.4 oz tube<br>  you should wait around a month after you strip it to dye it again|`|paV2LdR9aa	Hmmm I've done it, your friend's done it, and it was fine (apart from the scalp!), but I'd hate for you to have no hair left!<br>  Can't you just use a really strong shampoo like Vosene and help the black fade a lot? Then use a brown shade on top?<br>  Good luck :)|`|ESAMvi4taa	You should never ever try to handle stripping black color from your hair at home.  At best, you'll fry your hair and burn your scalp and skin.  At worst, you'll end up with no hair at all.  Please please please let a professional colorist handle this!|`|i0uDt7H9aa	sounds painful.<br>  and why on earth would you die your hair black? sigh..|`|8HoSUgMXaa	yes|`|154dzJ1Faa	Removing artificial colour does not "fry" your hair.  It only removes the artificial colour molecules from the hair.  The hair is already damaged from the colour (and black is the very worst colour you could have chosen) and the remover won't damage it further.<br>  <br>  Remember that all tints (you didn't use a dye) contain bleach, so your own colour is not there anymore.  When you remove the black, you are going to be left with a yellow, or orange, or red colours.  You will have to apply another colour over that to make it presentable to the public.  That is if you can get the black off.  Because black contains some extremely dangerous and strange ingredients, they may not come off, or may react badly with any chemical you use.  Do a strand test first.<br>  <br>  There should not be any burning of scalp with this product.  Don't shampoo your hair a day or two before using.  If necessary to have the hair clean, do not rub the scalp at all.  When used correctly, all products do the job.  You may find it easier, and cheaper, to have this done professionally.
9F0iuuMYaa	It really doesn't matter what kind of mascara you use. Don't pay attention to other people. You should you any type of brush that is curved. Use the bent end first and put it on the ends of your lashes then use the other side of the brush and work your way up the lash. It will make them look fuller and longer.|`|OhwCzGWYaa	Lash blast mascara or i use MAYBALINE XXL EXTENSIONS it comes with two brushes and they are awesome both of them but i think MAYBALINE XXL EXTENSIONS will work better for you
mJbwemH8aa	Dont be sorry thats why we r here, to help each other.<br>  <br>  You can use any of both, just pick one for sensitive skin, but when u get it try it first on a small area where u want to use it, if it was ok and didnt scratch u then u can use it, if it did scratch u then dont use it there, usually u put it for 10 to 15 min, and then remove it with a cloth and then clan it with water, its so easy and u can read how to use it on the box itself.<br>  And yeah u can use it everywhere, but try and test it first, some skin is sensitive to some products.<br>  <br>  .|`|egOOi6Imaa	If u have sensitive skin I would not use either one!<br>  These creams are for just putting them on ur legs and the hairs like dissolve. I have used both and the made my legs sting and itched like crazy and ur not suppose to itch them. You can use them on ur stomach also if you wanted to. Your better of waxing or shaving in my opinion

q1R8BDrnaa	I am a self taught tattoo artist. Yes it is possible... My advice would be to spend as much time as possible drawing. Then do blaock work... outlines etc. Shading can be tricky when doing a large piece, but you will learn, I offered people I knew free tattoos and explained I was learning. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and don't let anyone ever tell you it isn't possible :)|`|hgNXQbJsaa	i met a guy who taught himself while he was in jail<br>  hes damn good now<br>  he can also make a tatt gun with a bic pen and a tape deck<br>  crazy|`|hCI0KnOraa	There is a tattoo shop down the road from me that I absolutely love...and 2 of the tattoo artists there are self-taught. They are absolutely amazing at what they do. <br>  <br>  So I would have to say that yes, it is possible to be successful as a self-taught tattoo artist. <br>  <br>  It may take you longer to learn and become successful in the long run, but if this is something that you love and want to learn, it's definitely worth trying! <br>  <br>  I would say to practice drawing up tattoos first. Maybe have some friends toss some ideas at you and see how close you can get your drawings to what they were thinking about. After you are comfortable with that, then I would say that you should invest in the equipment. Get a feel for it and learn how to use it. After you are comfortable, try a small tattoo on yourself to get a feel for putting ink to skin. A lot of apprentices around here do their first tattoo on themselves. Then, as you become more comfortable, ask if any of your friends want to be guinea pigs. :) <br>  <br>  After a while, if you stick with it, it will be possible for you to gain employment within a shop or start your own. <br>  <br>  I live in the US but I'm sure that Canada has some regulations that you have to follow. Make sure that you obtain all of the necessary blood born pathogen, safety, sanitation, etc. certification and classes. <br>  <br>  Good luck and happy tattooing!|`|kCdISEGqaa	Only in North Dakota and New Mexico.  All other states have licensing requirements that include some type of apprenticeship.  Learning to tattoo is not something you can do by reading books or watching DVD's from eBay, it is a hands-on learning process.  The first time you turn your machine on and feel the vibration, it will shock you.  You will realize, it's not like working with a pen, pencil, or paintbrush.  Best not to try.  A lot of people have dream jobs they cannot fulfill, I hate to be so negative, but just being a good artist isn't good enough.  You have to be a great artist who can work in all types of media.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If you weren't open to any suggestion, then why did you ask.  People like you irk me.  First, you didn't say you were in Canada, and yes, children have dreams, and we do tell them to reach for the stars, but, would you expect a child who has an IQ of 72 to be able to become a Heart Surgeon?  You asked a question and wanted answers, were you hoping some inexperienced teenager or someone who is just looking for points would say , "Yes, anyone can do it!!!"  Get real man, and accept my answer for what it is.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I know of people that practiced on themselves and that is how they learned. Maybe you should try that because if you know how to draw and all of that they only skill you need is how deep to go into the skin etc.|`|3llK5y7Baa	i sure as hell wouldnt trust you=) and thats the truth

You can't actually make your skin stop producing as much oils as it regularly does, but you can reduce the amount of excess oil you apply to your face.<br>  <br>  Use an oil-free cleanser (I use Biore's Pore Unclogging Scrub), an oil-free toner (I use Biore's Triple Action Astringent), and an oil-free moisturizer (I use one from Biotherm).  Follow all 3 steps twice a day, morning and night.  Personally, I only use the toner at night because I find it a bit too strong.<br>  <br>  Also, get some oil blotting sheets.  They absorb the oil that's on your face in an instant.  During school, I go to the washroom every once in a while to use the oil sheets.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. :)|`|YhnY09JQaa	try using foundation for oily skin.<br>  <br>  or buy a face cleanser and moisturizer. use this every morning and night. <br>  <br>  Good luck!:)|`|Vge3KBaMaa	ergh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YiDhb60Paa	Use Clean and Clear or Neutrogena to wash your face if it is oily. If it is dry, you can use Dove. Certain face washes don't suit certain people, and I have recd. letters from some readers who tried Neutrogena and it did not suit them. I presume the same could be the case with Clean and Clear. So, first you could try Clean and Clear if you live in India, since it is locally made and far more economical. Also, remember that due to dust, pollution and oily skin, your face will get oily during the day, no matter what face wash you use. So if you want your face to stay oil-free during the day, you can: <br>  Carry compact powder. You can dab it on your face when it starts looking oily, <br>  Wash your face again during the day, or <br>  Dab your face with tissue to absorb the oil - yes, it works! <br>  Apply a light oil-free, matte foundation to your skin during the day, and when it gets oily, wipe your skin with tissue and reapply the foundation. Remember that certain compact powders may not suit you, so if you start getting a few pimples after using compact, try another brand. Also, remove the compact powder as soon as you reach home, and leave it on for as less time as possible. This will help reduce the chances of it irritating the skin. Applying compact powder is perhaps the best way of ensuring that your face looks oil free|`|lX1zpaoAaa	OK so I have the same problem, not as severe but still the same. I have tried pro-active and it REALLY helps!! Or you can carry around Clearasil daily pore cleansing pads. My dermatoligist told me to do that and in the middle of the day just go to the bathroom and wipe your face down.

adyNCp6eaa	Make sure you wash your hair thoroughly. Take a shower every other day. Also cut about 1/2 inch to 1 inch off your hair to get rid of the split ends. Cutting off the split ends makes your hair grow faster. Just keeping your hair healthy is the best way to make your hair grow faster. Some other tips are to: DONT-use a straightener or curler on  your hair, use hairspray/mousse or any other product on your hair. Just keep it clean and healthy and it will grow like crazy!

I have this stuff I think it's called Certain - Dri, you put it on before bed and it minimizes pores. I also use Dove cucumber melon and that works really well. Good luck.<br>  edit: I also have some advice for when younotice you are sweating. DON'T keep your arms tight to your body, it creates more heat and you sweat more. Also, don't think about it because it makes your stress hormones work harder which results in more sweat. And, I have this problem with Certain-Dri, not sure if anybody else does, I have really dry skin, so I apply oil free lotion about 15 minutes before otherwise it burns. If you also have dry skin, I strongly suggest doing that. Good luck.|`|qCQ5z8ISaa	I agree with Jessica (lol) use Certain-dri and then some dove deodorant.|`|H9DY3ElFaa	Im a chic and I use axe deoderant.

I can't buy certain shirts because I might sweat too much in them and it will show.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I also have Certain-Dry and it works well. You have to put it on before bed though, because if you put it on like normal it doesn't really work. <br>  <br>  You can feel the difference after a little while, it's nice!<br>  <br>  Some deodorants are just to cover the smell, and might make you sweat more!|`|S93sH3fFaa	Yes, I agree with Exasperated's answer.<br>  The deodorant that works for me so far is the degree clinical protection.<br>  <br>  I think that one thing you should do too, is to keep extra shirts, deodorant and perfume in your handbag.

I do that, mostly during summer time at work...<br>  It happens to me all the time...that's why I love winter...hehehe<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!   : ) : ) : )<br>  P.D.

But now and then it makes you feel better to change your image slightly occasionally. It will give you heaps more confidence in yourself :D<br>  <br>  I would recommend finding a style you are comfortable with and that you feel like you could wear. Go to your local town and try some new outfits. Also websites such as:<br>  <br>  -<a href="http://www.styleinsider.riverisland.com/insiders" rel="nofollow">http://www.styleinsider.riverisland.com/...</a> will keep you up to date with new and upcoming fashions. Try shops like topshop, Urban outfitters, mango, warehouse, h&m where a variety of styles can be found. If you want to stand out go for bold accessories and prints, if not try classic neutral styles like preppy. <br>  <br>  Also hair is a vital part of your appearance. Well groomed hair can make you feel and look great. So maybe have a change in colour or cut.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps . :) x|`|2MoU921aaa	their idiots ^ . I think longer hair would suit you alot more and maybe even black or a darker brown. Get a side fringe because i think it will suit your face.

Maybe try a fringe also. I think you liike cool anyway - not geeky at all!|`|3s1QAp4kaa	Hello there (:<br>  You already have a really nice face structure and lovely clear skin. I'd suggest not going overboard with the makeup but using a bit of dark mascara and some dark blue eyeliner - that will make your eyes look absolutely stunning and bring out their lovely colour. Try soft pastel shades for the lips; I think a peachy pink would blend wonderfully with your creamy skin tone. And for the hair; get a small sideswept fringe to break up your forehead a bit, and maybe curl it once it a while; it will do miracles for your self -esteem.<br>  Keep smiling!<br>  -Lauren<br>  xxx|`|OhwCzGWYaa	do the posh hair cut and how bout little eyeliner and mascara that should do it|`|ad4372432ad2264989a9b750c0bb4a40aa	Dont worry about trying to change your looks all you need to do is put some eyeliner on and lip gloss|`|6VI13LG2aa	apply extreme make up e.g lots of mascara and red lipstick to make you look less bland and die your hair bleach blonde :D|`|AA10929474	Turn emo?

A steady hand and a light hand. hold the corner of your eye, don't pull on it, gently with take some of the eyeliner off the pointy applicator back into the bottle, so that way there is less on the wand. do the bottom first and let dry and then the top. My daughter's who I taught, actually do it better than I do?<br>  Hope this helps. Remember one thing though if it looks good on someone else it may not on you, depending on your eye shape. We often want the look and sometimes we succeed and other times nope.

154dzJ1Faa	Without knowing how those short ends appeared, it's hard to know what to do.<br>  <br>  You may have broken them when you had the bleach.  That happens if you over-lap the bleach application on hair previously bleached.  It's very delicate work, and with care, breakage is minimal.  If you did it yourself, that may be the cause.<br>  <br>  It may be that you broke off the hairs with the straightener.  That is very common on the top because you can't see well from your angle, and the hairs are more delicate when bleached.  If the irons were hot, you may simply have burnt then off -- really easy to do.<br>  <br>  There is a technique in styling your hair to make them all lie along with the rest of the hair.  You may try some styling aids to control those ends.<br>  <br>  For now, you may just have to wait until they get longer.  When hairs are short, they stand up easily, but not when they get longer.  If you have them all the same length, they are broken off, probably because of the bleach and/or straightener.  Be careful how you handle your hair with either of these procedures.|`|tP2NScAiaa	try using a good moisturizing conditioner on your hair when you wash it, dont wash it so much, dont dye it again for a while, try to use a damage spray on it when you straighten it, and when they stick up, just use hair spray to get them to stay back down.

mJbwemH8aa	That depend on the type of both tattoo's. Normally it work well and good when the old one is small and not so dark, and the new is bigger and darker.<br>  <br>  .|`|RShi5KUmaa	you can cover the tattoo up.  Just get a good tattoo artist so he/she will do a good job at covering up|`|dpNjZ0YGaa	I think you can't unless the first 1 is small and the new one is bigger but still i think u won't ba able to see what either of them are.|`|228c0b96ec6b75619e5f3cd6da080b5faa	my teacher did this and you cant tell what either of them are. good luck!
58MWGfgJaa	If you already have highlights, and they're the size that you want your red highlights to be: <br>  <br>  1. Just isolate those highlights with foil (Rectangular pieces you can make) and dye the rest of your hair with black.<br>  2. Then, with the highlighted bunch, dye it red and re-wrap it in the foil.<br>  <br>  This way, it saves up on time, is more precise, and won't damage your hair by dying it twice! :D<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  (P.S. remember that with the highlights, just because the bunch doesn't look big, it will look thicker once it's finished because your hair doesn't just stay in place. :{ Don't highlight it all black because there's no guarantee that the red will go over it, and it will damage your hair by dying it so many times)|`|tP2NScAiaa	dye it all black, bleach the thin pieces that you want red, then go over it with the red dye.|`|pxwW8bKbaa	love that look:) very cool.<br>  <br>  first<br>  <br>  dye all you hair black <br>  <br>  second <br>  <br>  well your gonna need like.. a shower cap? lol.. or some kinda hat like that to cut holes through.. then just pull the pieces out that you want to dye..

ESAMvi4taa	7 times.  Oh jeez.  You're going to need a lot of work to get it out.  One time is hard enough to get out.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you go to another salon and get a second opinion.  Tell them that you understand it will not all come out in one processing, and that you're willing to make the commitment to several, spaced out stripping procedures.  <br>  <br>  But other than that, I'm afraid you're going to have to wait for it to grow out before the dye and damage from stripping are gone.  You've really done your hair in.  It's going to be at least a year or two before you even really begin to see recovery from the damage|`|Nzdc5C8Raa	I've dyed my hair black  5 or 6 times and am tired of it so I went and bought a hair dye remover from Sally Beauty Supply.  When I found out how harsh the bleaching is to your hair, I decided to get professional help. I called about it and they said it'd be over 100$ just  for hair color & she recommended going with some caramel highlights for now (it was still 80+ bucks) so I'm just waiting for my brown hair to grow back out now & save the money & possibly my hair too.  lol|`|ELdWkb7eaa	diet coke my friends.<br>  it helps fade hair dye. but makes sure its diet! the normal sugary stuff does not give the same result.<br>  <br>  try it. it might fade your color a bit|`|6Tx8Opmraa	I suggest going to a Salon, But if not, Get 40 volume and Bleach.. If you really need this out, your hair is going to be overprocessed, Since you have a build up of hair. I just tried this SAME thing. I had a build up of color, My mom(who is a professional.) Bleached my hair. The ends wouldn't turn, and it took Several hours, and twice bleaching with 40 volume to even get them to lift a Dark golden blonde. My hair ended up 3 different colors of blonde.  I ended up recoloring my hair back to Black.|`|d7d802ca533a4267115826972a47888caa	it takes a while but use a clarifying shampoo fades out eventually i did it when i had black hair like 10 yrs ago and it worked   but like i said it takes some time

KNpUc7wKaa	yes fully possible.<br>  Hair can change colors and texture with age. It is usually due to hormone changes (menopause, pregnancy, age, diets, etc etc). My aunt had brown hair that turned white when she got older and is impossible to color. Also I know people, including myself, who used to have loads of curls as a child and then grew out of it. <br>  Be glad its a gradual change, you have time to learn how to maintain and take care of curls:) A hair dresser might give you some hints on how to do this. Probably change in shampoo, some conditioner and hair drying techniques.<br>  Good luck and enjoy:)|`|3o6qACycaa	Yes this can happen.<br>  Your hair does grow out from the roots differently every ten years or so, it can grow out a slightly different colour or thickness.<br>  <br>  If the curls are just at the ends of your hair and it is not growing out from the roots differently then I would guess that it is damaged by heat. This can cause hair to frizz/curl.<br>  <br>  Are you straightening and blow drying your hair a lot?<br>  <br>  It's a vicious cycle with heat styling, you use the straighteners more to get rid of the kinks but in reality you are damaging and kinking your hair more and more which makes you straighten more and more and the cycle continues.<br>  <br>  Try a good conditioning treatment and leave your hair to dry naturally.|`|Fnajjc8Maa	yes, it is possible as it happened to me and my daughter.  I had straight hair until I was about 11 years old, it started to get wavy all over and curly underneath at my neck.  By the time I was 21 my hair was very curly (ringlet curls).  I am now 42 years old and my hair looks like I have a spiral perm.  My daughter who is now 18 years old is experiencing the same thing I did only her hair is not quite as curly at mine was at her age.  <br>  My sister's hair was dead straight her entire life until she had a baby at age 23 - during the last couple months of her pregnancy her hair started to get wavy and stayed that way.|`|azcwMiO8aa	Mine did.  It took me forever to learn to live with it.  I got garnier nutrisse shampoo & conditioner for long straight hair, and I got the smoothing milk.  This works really well when I want straight hair.  Then I got all the curly hair products too.  I've found I like the variety.<br>  Mine started curling from the top, and I thought I was going to have to cut if off really short.  But I have a friend who is a hair dresser, and she told me how much difference better products can make.  So have fun with it!|`|bAY9j21Paa	at MOST you will have some very slight curl to the bottom ends of your hair as you age..but no it will NOT go dramticly curly by anymeans.. Also how has the weather been, humid? that can also cause hair to curl more ironically when you are very young like a baby and older.|`|RkIgHyRCaa	Yes, absolutely.

Your hair texture changes about every seven years, so it is possible that this is what is happening.|`|L94XXSO5aa	It is definitely possible.  My hair was just slightly wavy, and went *way* curly after I had my daughter (who is 14 now) and never went back to being straight.|`|AgDDajdVaa	it's very possible..<br>  it has something to do with <br>  genetics and with you developing <br>  your traits..<br>  your hair could be as straight as ever <br>  and over time it could end up curly.<br>  i had super straight hair when i was little<br>  and now its pretty wavy..<br>  dont worry, if you dont like it wavy or <br>  curly, you can always straighten it...<br>  good luck :D|`|hTP75xwTaa	your hair can change different textures up to 7times i really don't know how likey it is but my went to rough to curly...hey i didn't complain i love it!! cons- its getting thinner but yea its possibly. <br>  <br>  things you eat,put in your hair etc. can change its texture|`|0096c3418e13efef6fa5ffa773b0c10aaa	Yes is possible because that is my experiances before my hair is straight but now a day my hair turn to curly hair.|`|AA10148408	it sounds like a blessing, everybody wants the bottom ends curled.  millions of women go for this look every morning with a curling iron.|`|WDCX9Cnkaa	yes its possible while growing up my hair was so striaght but now as im getting older (15) my hair is starting to get all curly but it depends if your hair was natural curly|`|f6LIPZ1Naa	Haha happened to me I used to have pretty straight/kinda wavy hair and now it looks like annalynn mccords!|`|NET9UMSGaa	yeah that happened to me, I used to have stick straight and now I have pretty nice curls and I am happy with it|`|q1R8BDrnaa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  Mine has gone from curly to straight so why not the other way around? :P|`|vUp7BMtMaa	if you like your curls,then mousse it and the curls wil have more body,<br>  talk to your hairdresser :)|`|HB3fDXeMaa	yes it is....my boyfriend had the exact same thing happen to him when he was 19.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I used to have crappy curly hair.

lypVGSI0aa	I get my extensions at Sally's beauty supply, best place to get them and they are human hair and great quality ^^ the price depends on what length you want. 18 inch cost me about 45 dollars but they are worth it<br>  <br>  <br>  As for putting them in it also depends what method you use<br>  <br>  Glue-ins- i have these, they hold and you dont have to worry about them coming out unless you put conditioner into the part where you glued it in. But the bad side is getting them out is slightly painful @_@<br>  Clip Ins- Easiest and non painful, just get the clips and the extensions  and you can take them out whenever. Bad side for those is they can get really annoying. they feel like they are going to fall out and if you accidently hit your hair you might have to redo it all<br>  <br>  Fusions- You go to a salon for that.. its pretty pricey... they end up glueing little plastic bonds to your hair and the extensions.. those can damage your hair and eventually break<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps o.o|`|SpcYCBndaa	ask britney spears|`|90TZw6NFaa	Sally's beauty supply has it all. You can buy extentions for cheap & just buy the clips, sew them on yourself & it saves you alot of money. I have clip in extentions & I love them.

53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	the composition is so different from ashes which can be ground to a powder.<br>  how about melting down your ring and having an original piercing instead if what your intention is,is to have it in your body.|`|tOItOSZHaa	i dont know if that is possible , but if its a band with no stones id say a tattoo/pericing/implant shop can place it under you skin lets just say upper breast for example and it would be harmless and in its whole form and may be removed at burial for any heirs as keepsake , a web site called bmezine.com  i think its spelled or ur google will fix/and find it  , you can see the many things people have had implanted , some more extreme than others , but u can get an ideal how they look healed , matter o fact im going to check it now for ring implants gl|`|LYxCuCWhaa	This is a beautiful idea. I can't answer your question but I just wanted to say that I love this. I don't know about you but putting someone's ashes into a tattoo sounds seriously morbid to me... though it's the thought that counts I guess.<br>  Anyway, good luck|`|ZkrGttKaaa	Yes, the skin would reject it. Big time.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	possibly. you might ahve a problem mixing it with the ink too|`|kCdISEGqaa	Hi, I think the thought behind the idea is wonderful, but, the body would reject the gold, it would consider it a foreign material and push it out.  I like the idea of melting it down and getting a piercing from the new piece of jewelry.  A lot of miners (gold, coal, silver) scrape themselves at work and the material they are mining can become lodged under the skin.  Eventually, the body pushes it out.  My grandfather used to tell us it was the body's way of keeping itself clean.  I do know of people who are in accidents and the glass can stay under the skin if it's not picked out, and some children who fall off of their bikes get rocks lodged beneath the skin.  But, the gold, I think the body wold reject it.  Now, here's a totally absurd option, and I don't pretend to know anything about it, but, some people are now doing a body modification where they are having implants put under the skin to make the skin protrude.  Do I think it sounds like a good idea?  No, but I know people are doing it.  Would a gold ring be something you should put under the skin?  I don't know, I am not a medical professional, but, people are doing it with other materials.  Best wishes!!!
lU8e0VQFaa	Use warm sea salt soaks 2-3 times a day for 10-15 minutes each, you don't have to use soap (I never do and I don't get infections) and a lot of times it can dry out the piercings, DO NOT turn the earring, there's no reason too. Keep hands, hair and any products away from it. If it gets infected DO NOT remove the piercing this will only trap the infection inside the body. Just keep cleaning it with the sea salt soaks, maybe 4 times a day, if it gets very painful, red, hot to the touch, pussing, these are signs of infection. Your body will most likely be able to take care of it itself, but you may need to see a Dr.|`|9vLJbiHeaa	DONT USE SAVLON !!<br>  sorry for caps<br>  but the best thing to do is clean it with hot salty water ( use sea salt not normal salt), if you cant stand the stinging of the hot water try warm water, the salt acts like a sterilizer to it doesn't get infected.<br>  if ti gets infected just clean it with salty water and within a week it should be back to normal<br>  signs of infection - swelling, very sore, headache, ear ache, possing, redness and a little bleeding.<br>  good luck|`|H9DY3ElFaa	Follow the instructions you piercer gave you, That's probably the best. But basically make sure you clean it with antibacterial soap twice a day, DONT TOUCH IT unless your cleaning it. Make sure to also turn it while your cleaning it. Signs of infection, pain, throbbing, area feels hot redness( which could also just be from healing/ irritation from cleaning) IF it does get infected. Don't take it out because then it could close with the infection inside. Go to the piercer you got it done at and see what they say.
yZOtLDtbaa	do u want to order it on ebay.com or eshopintuition.com? there are many cute sunglasses on sale. maybe you could find your favor from both sites.|`|Qi39t3tgaa	I found this website hopefully it helps you and from what I read it is pretty cheap.
On57DVlAaa	Wear it with Leather Leggings or tight leather pants and some ankle boots. (not so high so you can jump)<br>  <br>  Not the jeans ^ it's a concert. Be bold!|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Skinny jeans, leather leggings, or just leggings.|`|OTH0zqPEaa	Leggins and black patent high heels :D|`|QYMTnD0Iaa	ripped jeans with flip flops|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Always wear black leggings and a long cardi or short shrug with tubes. For shoes opt for a slide of black or cheetah print, a neat trick with slides is to take a black 1-2 inches wide ribbon and make it long enough to wrap around under the heel of the shoe, cross behind your heel and wrap around your leg while ending with a big bow. You can add a long scarf with the long cardi if you like, black or cheetah print. Try to locate a wide belt of black patton or swede with a big buckle. Pile you hair up and use black clasp to hold it in place. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|L7wo7mPQaa	black leggings and it doesnt matter what length the leggings are and then black flats, and hair in a ponytail and your bangs back if you can like in your avatar i think|`|S22SYneBaa	Gray skinny jeans, blak stilettos, and gold accesories.|`|cRUfNnKiaa	gold brown or black skinnies with boots and a very iinteresting necklace to attract attention to your face|`|LuDu27z2aa	From a guys perspective, NO bra would be great!!|`|TrdmZAMdaa	ripped jeans with heels or leggings with flats|`|fy4ivQp2aa	jeans|`|YKydXFJ5aa	A sweater.. :p|`|SS87lbOCaa	its cute wear leggings with it
SgPg9Y8iaa	There is a little known company (in the US at least) called Lily Lolo that is AWESOME.  <br>  <br>  I am Asian with darker skin and red undertones.  I can't wear over the counter makeup because it's always too peachy or red for me.  <br>  <br>  Lily Lolo has great neutral tones and they use a yellow base for some of them.  I've noticed that they have foundation and concealer not only for my skin but also for African American skin.  <br>  <br>  I think the product is great, the minerals are high quality and you can order samples before buying the real thing.  <br>  <br>  This is what their About Us blurb says:<br>  <br>  Lily Lolo has been around since 2005 when founder Vikki Khan discovered mineral makeup and couldn’t believe that there was no gorgeous affordable range available in the UK. Since then mineral cosmetics have become much more popular with most cosmetics companies offering some mineral products but we’re committed to keeping all our minerals healthy and strictly au naturel. All of our products contain the minimum of ingredients (natural ones at that) but still promise truly great products that really perform. We’ve built up a cult following as a mineral specialist and thanks to our loyal customer base we’re now expanding and developing new products. Our promise to you is no nasties, no parabens, no synthetic dyes and definitely no nano-particles and of course – fabulous healthy products!<br>  <br>  I've found that their foundation is better than Bare Minerals or any other mineral foundation that I've tried.<br>  <br>  This is their website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lilylolo.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lilylolo.co.uk/</a>|`|eZYqo9YCaa	clinque|`|qCd4T4o5aa	Aveda has liquid and powders...|`|rrpTvQVkaa	Bare Minerals. It has beautiful colors and also is better for your skin! :)
QMbxBynZaa	your pants are too small for you. the waist is like that because you need a belt and all their pants are hip huggers so they seem to be ubber loose at the wste and not the hips. not to be mean, but tighter pants look really bad on almost everyone, they emphasize you're lumps and curvs (in a bad way & even if you dont have any, they make it seem you do.) try getting pants a little bigger. just a tiny bit'll do it ;)|`|QBbcbYziaa	i have that same problem. it happens with all their jeans. i have come to a conclusion that maybe my butt just isnt big enough to hold them up. lol but no i have no idea why either. have you tried a belt cuz that seems to help a little for me but they still slide down.|`|8iR6XOD7aa	well i hope you know that your supose to go up a size when buying skinny jeans. and i have hollister jeans too and i always have to pull them up. they fit everywhere but my waist.|`|cRUfNnKiaa	hollisters brand is different you could possibly try something else the same happened to me so i just tried different brands you are probably not fat at all its just the shape of the jeans|`|C1imDsmbaa	uggs? yuck. Wear a belt? That would be a good idea. Wear something more comfortable is better.|`|SS87lbOCaa	idk dont buy jeans there no more, maybe you need to gain weight so they dont slide down :)|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Well, your thighs are bigger than your waist.  So they're loose around your waist and sliding down.  They're tight on your legs because your legs are wider.  Plus, even with spandex, jeans stretch throughout the day (sitting in class, for instance), so the wide waist just gets wider.<br>  <br>  New jeans won't fix the problem, it's your body type.  You can easily solve it by wearing a belt, though.  That'll keep the jeans from being able to move anywhere at your waist.|`|C4bB27wwaa	Maybe its becuase one you slide them on the stretch out a lil annd arent as tight at the waiste you should just wear a belt so they wont fall anymore to be that could be the only solution|`|PefglUNaaa	ur hips may be too small for the jeans. no matter how tight they are, if you hips are too samll theyll fall of. try wearing a belt. i find that helps alot.|`|2pwIT6TXaa	Just wear a damn belt. It's new, that happens to me sometimes.|`|dTwMXT89aa	that happens to me all the time. its because they ARE so tight that when you sit they just slide down. if you wear a belt it helps but there is nothing you can do about the belt. if this is not what your talking about then it might be because some jeans stretch out through the day like abercrombie jeans.<br>  <br>  EDIT: kiwi if you wear something comftrable its most likley they are ugly. sorry. oh and sorry i didnt notice you said hollister. well they are the same company so i guess there jeans are like that too. i dont buy my jeans there because they are too baggy on me but yeah.
cKmSh7lcaa	It is unhealthy to wash hair daily as this removes all the protective, natural oils.  If you can wash it every two or three days it would be much better for your hair.<br>  I find it better to use a separate (cleansing) shampoo - Neutrogena produce one that leaves hair feeling squeaky clean - and conditioner.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|5PWEBOj0aa	i only use shampoo and condition every other day... and my hairdresser said I could even use conditioner everyday but only use the shampoo every other day... everyone always loves my hair... and its strong and healthy... so i guess it works...<br>  <br>  oh ya I tried the 3 day thing... my hair gets oily at the scalp...<br>  and i tried the everyday thing and it gets dry and breaks easy...|`|hlwjOwGWaa	do whatever feels  feels best, if you have dry hair, do it every other day, or how many days feels confortable, if you have oily hair, you may need to wash it every day<br>  <br>  but it really depends on YOU and what type of hair you have. <br>  good luck|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	I think washing my hair every other day is why my hair is finally beginning to grow and look more beautiful.  It is still clean on the second day because I use very little (if any) styling product.  My hair still smells fresh as well and washing every other day also preserves my color.|`|8Pf65Bxjaa	my hairdresser told me that i shouldn't wash them more than three times a week, thou it's hard to stick to that as i have really oily hair
mJbwemH8aa	What do u mean by skin above yr eyelids??<br>  <br>  Please explain.<br>  <br>  .
ibtLgY5Xaa	Yes, I want it!|`|JqDkLWeTaa	nooo way i used it and it wasnt worth it|`|BvjPU3wkaa	Using a toothbrush to gently scrub and exfoliate your lips and following it up with a lip balm will do the exact same thing. Save your cash.|`|yEaf6d0Jaa	no way<br>  just use a toothbrush then put some vaseline on|`|p5qfFzEKaa	No, I tried it, it's not worth it.
d91cfa75118bff4f9a92c36721da90feaa	I bought the kymaro body shaper, it fits like a regular girdle.  All the hype and promises of slimming down two dress sizes and fitting into the clothing better is a big joke.  The promise of invisible lines are also not true.  I bought the Kymaro body shaper not expecting to appear slimming but hoping to eliminate the lines girdle lines under certain outfits.  When I wore the Kymaro body shaper the line at the bottom of the kymaro (just over my knees where visible through my pants.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - it is just another costly product that does not do was promised.
WVVdf4ILaa	Hey M!<br>  <br>  well what i would do (and what i'm wearing maybe) is to wear a cute sweater. not one that is big and bulky but a thin one that can be paired with a long scarf (like a winter one to keep warm) or certain silver necklace (u no what i'm talking about lol)|`|tAQOcfA8aa	black leggings would be so cute with a long sweater, tall boots (like uggs) and a scarf.<br>  or tight sweats with a cute sweatshirt (hoodie) of like a sport you play.<br>  for things like these just wear hoops or studs. and barely any make up! Hope it helped!|`|GJKhzZZiaa	well you could try out some leggings or tights in a playful color with a long tunic so you can freely move around, nuthing too tight on your legs because you want to enjoy yourself, hope you have fun!|`|rEh0mhezaa	Why would she wear leggings ice skating? Won't she be cold? Sheesh!<br>  <br>  Jeans sound fine, with converse (to wear there before you put on the skates) and a cute hoodie. Have fun!|`|xc6a5Gmnaa	NO SKINNY JEANS!! make ur feet look huge. where flare jeans with a pink or blue t shirt, nothing fancy and bring a sweat shirt it is sure to be cold!|`|znHTUp6Uaa	just go casual.. a cool tracksuit would look best :)|`|S22SYneBaa	Hey, Girl! Well- if you aren't planning on falling, then jeans are a cute choice; on/off the ice they would be great. I would go for a dark wash- it is always more flattering and doesn't show wetness as easily. Tops- definitely bring a sweatshirt or fleece, but the actual top can be whatever you like and feel comfortable in! I would go for a pink top, but it really doesn't matter. Have a great time!|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	The first thing is a hoodie..then wear leggins with leg warmers and a short denium skirt, long scarf and gloves, stocking hat. Underneath wear a turtle neck sweater. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T

QMYNU9uNaa	I hate when that happens! It's definitely really annoying...I've had the same problem and then I discovered Urban Decay's Primer Potion.

However different shades look different depending on your original color.  I would suggest going to Sephora, or a make-up store where you can test the make-up first... then see which shade gets you the closest!

QfN2LUFkaa	try a straightening shampoo, blowdrying downwards, and brushing as you do to get it straighter.<br>  as for length... keep getting it TRIMMED every six weeks or so. this strengthens the hair and it will want to grow instead of just leaving it to grow. don't have too much off otherwise it will grow back to that length it was before and then you will get it cut again. just the ends need to come off. <br>  you will need a bit of patience.|`|qvSZqbDCaa	welll<br>  the only help i could give u...<br>  is to tell u to get a ''chi''<br>  hair straightener...<br>  it doesnt hurt your hair at all...<br>  it just makes it straight!<br>  and i have the same problem u do...lol<br>  but the chi help...<br>  plus my mom is a pro. hair dresser...<br>  and she knoes what i need to use...<br>  so she tells me...<br>  and this is what she said to do...<br>  and about the hair growing faster...<br>  get some hair moisturizer...|`|A5FMFVVaaa	i would use heat protective spray 4 ur hair and no ur not werid my hair does that sometimes 2

I also hear that cardio/physical exercise helps as well.  It is also suggested that you massage you scalp once a day (to stimulate it which I guess can make your hair grow faster).  Tight pony tails and pulling your hair [which can happen when you tighten your pony tail when it is too loose, so be careful] can cause damage to the hair follicles as well as over using blow dryers and such.  Also be sure to trim the end regularly.  It gets rid of the split ends which can lead to breakage, which you don't want if you want your hair to grow longer.  Healthy hair is happy hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  My hair grows really slow too so I know how you feel.  I got a really bad/short haircut back in August and had to grow my hair out again.

s5XNGbOMaa	No. If you look at the anatomy of your tooth, you have a "pulp" filled with nerves. I would assume that it would be extremely painful to get a piercing and subject yourself to cavities.

If you use the ones that last a day and just glue onto the eyelid, then it shouldn't hurt your natural lashes.<br>  If you use the eyelash filler-types or lash extensions that go in with your eyelashes and are meant to stay on for a couple of weeks and are usually applied by a professional, it can definitely be very very bad for your natural eyelashes.|`|p5qfFzEKaa	No, it won't, because the eyelashes aren't tied up onto your natural eyelashes like extensions are.|`|rzf4tMXGaa	well permanent fake eyelashes which last about 10 days will make real ones comes off.  but if you use the disposable ones then your real ones wont fall.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	No. They stick to the eye lid, they aren't attached to the lashes.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Not if you don't put them on the top of your real lashes,<br>  then how can they possible fall out?!<br>  Make sure you put them just a bit above your lash line,<br>  not right on top or else they will come off when you try to take them off!

ANQ2O2Ehaa	You just have to get some that have smooth seams on the outsides.  A lot of them have fabric that double over, and then they sew it, these will give you bad lines.

UYaWH7a0aa	I love my ceramic chi. It's all I use. There is also the ceramic hot tools version which I used before my chi. Honestly if you do your hair almost daily and really would use your straightner I think a Chi is a good investment - it also has heat settings so you don't fry your hair if you have more delicate/thin hair.  (I'm blonde so I use a much lower heat setting than my brunette sister) . To avoid poof & shiney-ness go with a Chi & get some straightner serum or spray for before you straighten.<br>  <br>  Chi's usually cost about $100 but if you go to Bed Bath & Beyond you should be able to use a 20% off coupon saving you a few bucks :) Again - look for investment & long term!!|`|MGOmVeMfaa	i've heard ceramic is the best but idk what the difference actually is lol<br>  i know chi's work really well but theyre usually like $100 at least if i remember correctly<br>  i don't use straightners much though... i love my curly hair =]
4TzTNEITaa	Messy buns are always fun. There is a couple of different ways to do them. I always start by putting my hair in pony, but when I wrap the hair tie around the second time I don't pull my hair all the way through, I then proceed to wrap it around the third time and then leave it in somewhat of a bun form. The other way you can do a messy bun is: put it up in a normal bun with bobby pins and all and then pull out pieces of your hair from the bobby pins. Hope this helps.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	Try scrunching your hair after you wash it, and then put it in a low messy bun and let a few of your frontal hair out of the bun.|`|IlhQvPYMaa	Try a side ponytail and when you finish take a small peice of your hair and wrap it around the pony and secure with a bobby pin. It looks really cute and is super easy. Also try braiding some of the hair at the front and pulling them back into the pony. It takes a little practice but is simple once you get the hang of it!  Messy buns are really cute too. Also if you add a cute headband or something that can always add a little something to a pony. Another way which I do a lot is to make a small poof with your bangs, then tease the back of your hair (really easy) and then kinda push it up to make it look full in the back. I hope I helped some!|`|XE4rmaPsaa	Try putting your hair in a ponytail and then clipping the end to your head using a clasp to give a nice. chic updo effect.You could also try a messy bun - pull your hair into a bun and secure at the base, then pull out strands of hair from the bun until they're sticking out, all over the place and pull out little wisps at the front to look casual, but very pretty! You culd also try accessories like grips and hairbands for a new look.|`|QfN2LUFkaa	get a clasp, twist your hair and fasten. looks nice, trust.
doHNEvf8aa	Remington Wet 2 Straight. <br>  <br>  it works really well.<br>  I let my hair dry before I straighten it but you can straighten it while it is stil damp.<br>  It should be at target, thats where i got mine.|`|u0eTvggDaa	Wet to straight if your not wanting to spend a good amount of money.<br>  <br>  Or a CHI, i have a chi and i have had it for about 4 years now, it takes about 10 seconds to heat up and it flat irons amazingly! i love mine!<br>  <br>  so with a CHI i believe it will last longer, <br>  yeah it's a little more expensive,but totally worth the price.<br>   you can find these in hair salons, or a sally's|`|zWoTe6c1aa	wet to straight<br>  <br>  you can get a small or big one<br>  20-30$|`|NY6HkQEvaa	conair|`|OF7ZHq19aa	No way not a conair thoes are cheap , cheap ones damage your hair quick I have an I.s.o its good I paid 100$ but the chi kind is better that's what I herd|`|XE4rmaPsaa	I've found that BabyBliss do really good ones for around ￡20, if you're on a budget.

I think i paid $35 for mine, but I have had it for 5 years... I was just looking at picking up a smaller once since I just got my haircut short and they do still sell them! I know its $5 more, but its sooo worth it!!|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	i love my wet to straight, i normally use it when my hair is dry but if i'm in a rush i can dry it and style it at the same time which is awesome. this is also my first straightener that doesn't catch my hair. my old conair one would break strands of my hair because they would catch on the plastic.

d2mWHSqlaa	Haha your necklace is totally not 18kt gold over sterling silver. Good job being screwed over by whoever sold you that.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	It means it's tarnishing and when it does this it turns black. You can try putting it in jewelry cleaner and see if that helps but chances are you will need a new one that's gold. The one you have the gold plating is wearing off.|`|rEh0mhezaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  My favourite necklace (a choker that fell off at camp and I haven't seen since... grr) did that to my neck all the time! It was my grandma's, and it was really old. After doing a bit of research for you, I have learned that while gold doesn't rust, it does oxidize, meaning that the black stuff on your neck comes from a patina, or film that has developed on the surface of your necklace. You can go out and buy gold cleaning stuff (i'm not quite sure what it's called, sorry). good luck!|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	When they coat silver with gold they use a thin layer that wears off very soon. What to do? I have been told this: use clear nail polish to coat the necklace before wearing, you might try it now if it hasn't changed colors too much. Otherwise buy another one in gold or ask for one for Christmas. Hope this helps..Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|dIBe1qL6aa	there are two possibilities here...maybe your allergic to the metal or the oxide....which is whats causing skin darkening...apart from that...the gold might wear off in 6months or so. depends how quickly the oxidization occurs :)|`|NY6HkQEvaa	take it off it will go away ina few days<br>  and just so u noe that necklace is fake cuz real gold dosent make the marks|`|xbczYMktaa	oh,my god.i met the same condition with you last year. but several months ago, my sister told me a website with a lot of necklace of high quality and reasonale price. i believe you will find your favorate one.|`|u5MMhrfOaa	It's most likely not real gold or silver. both of these metals are not supposed to turn your skin colors.
