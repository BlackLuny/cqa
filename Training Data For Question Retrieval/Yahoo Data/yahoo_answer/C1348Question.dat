20090203091132AAplEfI	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you think of post-feminism?	“Feminism came to mean denigrated motherhood, pursuing selfish goals and wearing a suit.” (Rye, 2003)       so according to Rye and other people the era of feminism is over and we're in an age of post-feminism where women delight in being girlish but at the same time sophisticated, happy women who know what they want but are not man-haters or manly.       What do you think about this?

Why do you make your mother and I feel like we did a bad job raising you?"       I really felt bad about that and it made me call the guy I met at the party and tell him we might need to end our dates. I tried to tell my Dad that i do what I do because I like it. Not because they failed at raising me. They did a great job raising me, but I'm gonna do what I like no matter what. But why am I feeling somewhat guilty?

20090220201330AAolPgn	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I dreamed a guy I don't know was in love with me. Please interpret?	I have my coat on but before I leave I remember I have to wait for my friend. she's in the play.So I go down to the auditorium.I walk into the rows where my classmates are. I stand in the audience as my friend  talks to me when a few of my guy friends along with M(the guy in my classes) come up and talk to me. they walk away but I'm confused as M and his friend continue talking to me. M seems not like his usual sarcastic self. he seems mellow. he's acting really nice to me but I think he's trying to be funny.      M staring at me while I am watching the rehearsal and pulls me onto his lap.I try to get up but he has me in a tight grip. I sit there as his friend looks at him.I feel akward as he's hugging me from behind lovingly and normally we don't even speak to eachother.we're both watching the practice and I feel these vibes running up my spine. He rubs his cheek on my shoulder and kisses my cheek sweetly.I look confused. his cheeks have flushed and he's smiling and looks so innocent and vulnerable. He looked happy.he normally has a bored look on his face or he's scowling.I get up and turn to a few people and we talk when his friends come and start talking quietly as he frequently turns around to look at me all weird. an english teacher rushes past me through the side door causing me to fall along with my papers and I'm frantic when he comes and helps me up. So when finished he pulls me on his lap again. I'm calm but I'm still thinking "wtf?"      as the actors are finishing I get off his lap and he holds my hand as we walk out but doesn't realize I'm trying to get away from him.he lets go of my hand as we near the door but I don't hug him. So I mutter bye as I run over to my teacher and I ask her what the play is and she says something that I can't spell but it's like "faw-vro!" or "Favre!" or something like that and walks away.

20090220181941AAnTS9c	Social Science;Psychology	Why is Confidence such a huge deal?	It seems like these days, everyone is focused on confidence, but would the general public define "confidence" is it the way one dresses, speaks, or could it be their body language or a combination of all three?      Personally, I think confidence is a state of being comfortable with oneself, while a great attribute, I think it's WAY overrated---I've met plenty of people who portrayed confidence and they turned out to be the most terrible, conceited, inconsiderate people---I've ever met.       Now, there are people who are confident and well mannered at the same time but what I mean is there are confident people that are arrogant, so if that's the case why not focus on a different quality like kindness or intelligence? I notice people are attracted to others in general (romantic or non-romantic) that display these traits and it just made me wonder why it wasn't the same case for another quality.      People in the past, said I lacked "confidence" because I was quiet and did not make enough conversation? How is that lacking in confidence? Do I have to be some chatter box in order to be confident? Or, I lack enthusiasm in my voice so i don't appear confident.        I'm confused.      Why is confidence soo important??

20090220184646AAalfe2	Social Science;Psychology	I truly need help... what should i do?	I babysit for 3 people, and just these past few days I called everyone to let them know that I will not be babysitting anymore because Someone is saying that I kicked a child. WHICH IT VERY VERY UNTRUE... how this came about is there was a friend of my husband and I that would stay the night every once in a while. I didn't like him staying over often so I'm not going to lie I was kinda a Bi*ch to him. but he went and told one of the mothers that I kicked her child in the tummy and that I was abusive. I, myself have 2 lil boys and one on the way, I could not nor would not ever in my life kick a child or even spank the child the wrong way. (wrong way being other then his or hers bottom)   I have had CPS Child care come to my house today to see how my kids are. Also CPS license/ investigations... I am more then willing to do what ever it takes. My thoughts are right now is since this is someone i thought was a friend of my family telling the mother this what kind of action should i take now?   2 hours ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   So far thank you for the advice. I did stop babysitting asap. I dont want to put my kids in any kind of danger. I am just scared because I have never been through any thing like this at all..   I just need some HELP   my husband is behind me 100% he knows me and know I would never do this to a child..   but so far thank you all..

I have been investing max in my 401k, mutual fund investments, etc as before in this downturn. My rational is that I am buying low and I currently do not need the money as I am still employed and have a good savings acct. I however am not sure I should keep doing this. I have also been adding money to a couple of mutual funds I own and my sons 529 plan on a recurring basis every month. (Note: Still losing money in them as well).       My balances are 50% less than my initial investments in totality of all my investments (401K, roth, etc). Not sure what to do. Should I continue investing as its low and it can get better? Or any other alternatives? Do you think it is wise to move everything into a stable fund yielding just 1%? What would you advice on selling funds that are sellable (non-IRA funds) in this market?

The only thing is that i was his first girlfriend, and yet, after a year, he came back to me, without trying any other girls. we are juniors in highschool. BUT, i know i have to talk to him about what he feels, but first can you tell me how i can tell if he is actually into me, or just doing it as a game of some sort? He is the hardest person to read.. even his friends tell me that he is so complicated to know exactly what he is thinking. He barely talks to me, and most the time i have to say something first. I feel like he doesnt think i am here for him. maybe its because ive been his only girlfriend and he doesnt know how to act.    What do you think he is doing asking me out a year after we broke up(and in that year we never spoke, only saw eachother in classes or in between classes). are there any signs to know if he really is into me or not?

Let's call her Sara. Sara was 25 years old, she died last week of pneumonia, she had developmental problems from a young age, (Rett Syndrome) so she looked like she was 12, and she had the mind set of a toddler, also didn't have the ability to walk talk or eat. (fed through tubes) She was a beautiful little girl, bright blue eyes, adorable smile, and I felt like I had a special bond with her I could always maker her laugh, I was helping to take care of her for the last two years along with other staff members. I seriously loved her like a daughter, i know that sounds a little strange. When she passed away I was devastated, couldn't stop crying.   But it seems like everyone else at work doesn't care...they carry on as if nothing has changed, they just gathered up all of her things and set them in her room for her mom and family to pick up this weekend. (She lived in a house with three other medically fragile adults)...

20090220200235AAufQMo	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What dose my dream mean?(Nightmare)?	I keep waking up around 3:00ck in the morning, shiver with fear. I would like to know what this consistent dream means:   It was dark, and silent. I was in a room with a black and white checkerboard floor. Red wallpaper was also plastered on the walls. I heard creeking noises from the floor. Soon, a demon crept from the ground and devours me.
20090220201312AA24JQB	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I think I can see the future in dreams...? Help please?	I think I can see the future in my dreams occasionally... I think its because of my mom.   About two years ago, my mom died of liver cancer. Now every once in a while, I briefly see her in dreams. Then, I've noticed that these dreams usually foreshadow things that usually happen in the following day. Like in this dream...   I got out of school, very excited. I was going to go to New York City today to meet my mother, and then we were going to go shopping and such. I walked to a train station and got on a train. It was a very beautiful, scenic train ride. When I got off the train, I realized something: My mother is dead. Why am I in New York City to meet her? I also remembered the many other reasons NYC was famous... for the crime. I quickly made my way to a nearby bistro, failing to escape the not-so-friendly stares of people walking by. They were eyeing my purse. My Dooney And Bourke purse. It was my only one, and I didn't think I'd be wondering about alone, so I brought it. They were staring at it, sizing me up I guess... I'm small, and definitely weak looking. When I was within the walls of the bistro, I called my father, hoping that somehow he could come and pick me up quickly. I had no relatives in NYC to stay with. I called him, and he said he could be there in a few hours. I hung up, and burst into tears. Someone as frail and weak as me had no chance of surviving by themselves, and soon the sun would set, and that's when the worst of the crime comes out. I kept crying. Then I was having, I guess a "flashback", or memory. It was my father, my little sister, and I playing video games together, just enjoying life. Then I noticed my mother in the doorway, just standing there, watching us, smiling. Watching over us maybe...      That day I went to BJ's with my father. I'm not four years old anymore, so I don't stay glued to his side all the time. We were standing in one isle that was almost empty, execpt for us and what looked like a husband and wife. I saw the wife staring at me purse, whispering to the man. My father needed an item in the next isle over, so I went over to get it, just so I could escape her frightening stare. I walked to the next isle over, and they followed me, walking a bit faster than usual. I recalled the woman staring at my purse, my Dooney And Bourke purse, and forgot why I was supposed to be in the isle. I ran like hell out of the isle, and looped back around to the isle where my father was. As I ran from the other isle though, I heard the woman say "She's wise." As I left the store with my father, I couldn't help but recall the cold, threatening stares from the people in my dream...            Since this incident, I've had a few other dreams, where my mother took part in the dream, where I found that they foreshadowed something happening the following day. Nothing this serevere though. Anyone have any ideas or input?

I've been hearing recently comments about Jade Goody (UK TV celebrity for those who are not in the UK) looking horrible without hair.Not dwelling on the fact she has terminal cancel and making money out of it (another ethical issue), does the fact a woman has no hair mean she's unattractive. I have alopecia, meaning no hair, and I'm open about it. It does help that I'm gay so most of the people around me don't mind, they actually find it interesting and exciting. But is it such a big problem? Is it for you?

20090203094651AA8MoXP	Social Science;Psychology	Cause or Effect - Mental or Physical?	Most people would say that a physical cause results in an emotional or mental effect. For example, a Doctor may say that a depressed person is this way because of a lack of a certain chemical in their brain, which is the cause, and the resulting effect is depression.    Do you think it is possible, in some cases, that the mental state - the condition of the human spirit - could be the cause, and the effect manifests physically? For example, could a person truly have depression within their own human spirit, and the effect results in the brain producing less of a particular chemical?    I only use one example (of depression) above, but please do not only focus on that in your response, as I am referring to all human conditions that have both a physical and mental action related to them.

20090203093031AAiMnZT	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is she trying to torture me, how the hell does she know when I'm going for a w"￡$?	Hi. I have been married for a while now and have a three year old son. My wife is a wonderful mother to our son.   Shortly after our son was born our sex life dissapeared, she basically told me that "we were at a point in our relationship where sex isn't that important anymore". Needless to say I've been pretty patient and respected her but as time's gone on it's just gotten worse and we're at a point now where I get sex ONLY when it's my birthday or christmas. She claims it hurts afterwards and I can understand if it does, but I'm not that big (6" floppy/8.5"- 9" erect)compared to some of the guys I've seen in the changing rooms. Besides there was never any problem before we had kids.    Anyway, I'm going off track here...... I'm not happy to, but can respect her right to not want sex, what's bugging me is that when I try to get some alone time to take care of it myself she always seems to rear her head; for christs sake - I was in the bath yesterday just thinking about making myself 'happy' when she decided it would be a good time to sit and chat about our son's schooling, for the whole hour I was in there. My wife doesn't allow pornography in the house, can tottally understand with impressionable minds and she's always hated it even when we first got together, but when I go on the computer she finds a reason to poke her head round the door every five minutes - it's getting serious now (I know some of you are probably laughing your asses off, but it's not funny to me).    It's got to the point now where I even called into a 'massage parlour'; I paid, got undressed and got to the point where things were about to happen before realising I couldn't do this to my wife and got dressed leaving more frustrated than I went in. I'm just at a point now where I have NEEDS and it seems like she is somehow enjoying watching the pain/suffering it's causing me.    Surely it's better to just allow me a bit of alone time than risk getting to the point where I do kop off with another woman - I'm just so confused about all this, surely she knows.

20090220212238AATBRo0	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Interesting Dream- can I get an interpretation?	This is kind of lengthy...      There's a dark room. I'm staring down at the floor with a strange symbol on it. There is a horse-drawn carriage facing 3 men with muskets. The symbol on the ground glows like a fire and I zoom right into it, traveling into an underground cavern.      In this cavern, there are strange devices. The devices are shaped like wishbones, but metal, with colored electricity pulsing through the frame. The devices protrude from the wall, and are big enough to fit a person inside the wide-part of the wishbone (this is hard to describe without drawing it.      Each device has a person in it. Each person has an Egyptian-style robe on, and they're in stasis. There are 7 devices total. The colored electricity has a pattern- purple, green, red, purple, green red, gold. At the bottom of the cavern is a big yellow light. In the red device just before the gold device, there's a red headed woman. She opens her eyes. I could see the fear in her eyes, like she was looking up at death. She screamed.      The woman is now in a lightly wooded grassland. There is a set of traintracks next to her. A bullet train speeds past her, but she keeps up with it. Everything is a blur as she and the train travel at the same speed. She's looking at the train and then blacks out.      There's a hovercar now, similar to an ambulance. The train has crashed, and the woman is unconscious. The entire grassy area is black. A man tries to wake the woman up. She claims she doesn't know what happened, like amnesia.      The woman and the man who woke her are now in an office. He asks her if she has ever sent an e-mail.      (Goes back to the dark room mentioned at the beginning) There's lightning firing everywhere. A tall dark skinned man in a strange robe is shooting purple lightning from his hands. I get out of the way and duck under the stairs. I vaguely remember seeing the woman and the man with me. There's chaos everywhere.      And I wake up.      If you're wondering how I got this dream, it is because I used a theta-wave frequency to influence lucid dreams. As soon as I woke up from the dream I found a notebook and started to write my amazing dream experience. It was the most unique dream that I have ever had.      Please let me know if you have any questions.      Thank you!

20090203094446AAkyuJI	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dreams about my past boyfriends, some sexual...and i'm married?	okay, in the last week (about every other night) i have been having weird dreams about some of the guys i dated before i was married. one dream in particular was really weird. i had dated a guy off and on for about 2 years (not sure if this matters, but we later admitted that our feelings about each other was intense. he told me more than once that he loved me, and even though i felt the same way i wouldn't say it back). although nothing sexual really happened between us, i had a dream about him that was very sexual. i had never dreamed about him this way before (the dream was very explicit). the rest of the other dreams about past ex's were very casual and not so serious? i've never done this before and i have no idea what to make of it? could someone possibly tell me what this means? thanks!

20090220215425AAeXXiA	Social Science;Psychology	Should i make a move and how?	today we got messed up (she's an upper and i'm a downer) and we went into the city and walked around for about 5-6 hours. we talk everyday on the the phone, 2 weeks ago we tripped together (it was legal don't fret) and we lay on my bed for 6 hours chatting up our subconsciouses, postering them for all too see.      though nothing intimate happened, it was alot of fun and things have been odd since. today in the city we were both tired (i took too much and for some reason she was just exausted it was great for the hour when we both had energy).      next week we may be going to newyork together to strut the walk of clothing shops on and around times square (bape, kidrobot, etc.) i'm hoping to take her to a nice restaraunt, something with atmosphere. we are 17 and it will just be us (we may go by plane which i'm psyched about).      do you think this will turn into something more than just an unconventional friendship? i asked her that a few nights ago and she said "idk, let's wait and see!!!"

20090220214856AAOc3ke	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream Interpretation- Friend Dreams?	OK, so this is going to end up being quite the lengthy question i think, but bear with me please.      So a while back, me and a friend (I'm male, she is female) started to become a lot better friends than we once were. She was having some slight relationship problems, and i was the only person she could talk to about it. Well, she and i started to talk everyday, for pretty much the entire day. During this time, she and i got extremely close, and became best friends, possibly a little more.      Sometimes, she and i would talk about dreams, and would attempt to interpret what they could possibly mean, but this is one that neither of us, well its kinda a series of dreams, but w/e.       When it started off, she and I were in our old high school's parking lot, it was VERY bright and sunny, and everything had a slightly blurred quality to it,  and we were joking around, and I ended up carrying her to her car, strange I know, but then i realized it wasn't her parent in the car and she and I both started to run as fast as we could. After a certain distance I unfortunately woke up.      The next day, she and i got onto the topic of dreams, and i explained my dream to the best of my ability, and then she stated that she had the same dream, but hers continued on from the point when i woke up.      Ok, so after all of that background information, I guess my first question is, Did the dream mean anything? And is it even Possible for 2 people to dream nearly the exact same dream?       Moving on, sorry for such a long Q, but this has been on my mind for a while.      After the first dream, she and I both had multiple dreams involving each other, like us hanging out, or dating, nothing serious but they were dreams nonetheless... SO, after all of that, can anybody come to the conclusion of whether or not My/Her dreams had any deep meaning?

20090220215852AAtpG1c	Social Science;Psychology	Can you help me figure out why I keep thinking this?	I always picture this old fashioned Sepia photograph...And in it is a father and a daughter. I think the father is wearing overalls... and his face cannot be seen, but he's tall. The daughter is about 10, and up to his chest. She is wearing a white dress. On her right hand, she has 6 fingers. The father has his arm around the daughter, and on that hand is a strange ring. The daughter is looking at the camera with a look of misery. They're in an old fashioned home. This always bugs me when I think about it...
20090220215601AAO7Y9B	Social Science;Psychology	How am I supposed to seek help when my therapist threatens to commit me?	I'm in a frustrating situation.  I mentioned to my therapist today that I had felt suicidal last week.  As the conversation progressed I realized that I needed to be careful with what I said otherwise I was going to get sent to a psych ward.  At this point I had to start lying to her when she asked certain questions.      I'm not going to be helped by being sent to a ward, I've been a few times, and I know what it is about.  I don't need the threat of possibly being committed, but I would like a therapist whom I can discuss my issues with both openly and frankly.      Any thoughts?

(:   - Why do you feel the way you do about your body?   - Have you developed any personality traits to cover up your dislike about yourself, or to accentuate how you enjoy the way you look?   - What do you think about the expressions "beauty is only skin deep" and "beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?

20090220214958AAy9YJR	Social Science;Psychology	Moving Rorschach Patterns?	A friend of mine posted a Rorschach Pattern on his profile, when i look at it it fades in and out into two different patterns, parts of it actually vanish while others stand out. I asked him if it was animated, and he said i need to have my eyes checked because it does not move, however, when i right clicked the image and checked the properties, it did indeed say "GIF image(animated 500 frames)" i have looked at other Rorschach Patterns online and only found one other that changed, but im certain it was animated because it changed too easily and always in a pattern at the same time. Can anyone suggest a place to look at more Rorschach Patterns and find out if there are moving ones out there? Or..am i really just seeing things?
