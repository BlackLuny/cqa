CBVlu3Gvaa	You may or may not have tried  shortening up on your 7 wd.  Grip down on the club maybe almost to the shaft.  That may give you the distance you need.  Another Idea may be to hit a hard punch 9 wd  Lower trajectory ...more roll.   I have found over the years that you can control distances better with trajectory.  Higher for softer landings.....Lower for more roll out.  Add in changing where I actually grip the club.  I can alter distance on a club by as much as 40 yds.    Hey its worth a shot.  Maybe you'll find the cure to hitting the clubhouse  in my little blurb here......Good luck and enjoy the game|`|sBrummATaa	i would try a 4 or 5 hybrid|`|KW6tdMgKaa	I would suggest a 3 iron, you will get more spin on the ball and keep shots on the greens. Hope this helps. Or go with a hybrid.|`|aX8nee8gaa	Since this is obviously a favorite of yours, let's not mess with replacing it. There are 2 shots that may help you. The 1st is if you have room to run it up. For this shot choke down a little, make your normal swing and hold the finish off with your hands about waist high. Don't just stab with your hands, really make a good turn through the ball and just hold the finish off. This will take about 10-15 yards off your normal carry distance and then run up. Great shot in the wind. Experiment with length of backswing to vary how far you fly this shot.  The other option is to make it land softer. For this you need to hit a high fade. Aim your feet and shoulders left, or open to the target with the clubface aligned normally. Now swing along your body lines and don't let your hands turn over in the follow through. You should get a much higher shot that will fly shorter than normal and land much softer.  Notice that you are not easing up or swinging easier on either of these shots, but you are taking distance off while still making aggressive swings.   If you can put these 2 shots in your arsenal, you can turn your pet club into a real weapon!  Good luck!|`|Wa7wktLkaa	i would suggest getting rid of the 3 iron, and getting a 5 iron. what are you doing with 2 clubs of the same loft. (3 iron and 7 wood.)

ljen1oasaa	I think it depends. But having looked at these bikes and talked to some of the local bike shops guys I think that you should ignore the ones that are capable of moving the rider around without the rider having to pedal because these bikes seem to be very heavy (50-60lb!!) and might only have a range of 20-30km, so if you run out of charge in the battery they are very heavy to pedal home unassisted.     I think I like the ones that just give you boost so uphill or in a big headwind you can switch it on and give you those extra few watts to get home. Not a bad deal for commuters I think. I would check out the Giant Freedom DX ($2500) or also the Schwinn Tailwind ($3000) as they seem to be light bikes that you can pedal normally and have a little extra boost when you need it.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	Quality- don't go for a cheap price because you only get what you pay for. I got mine relatively cheaply but after a few weeks I started having problems with the wiring due to leaking seals allowing in water. A lead acid battery is very reliable but also very heavy so if you want a light weight bike look for one that doesn't have a lead acid battery.    Edit- I should point out that they all come with an on/off switch so it is a real bike and most of the time I use mine without the motor.|`|1jPiAkP4aa	getting fat from being to lazy to ride a real bicycle

PLus the fans love both guys how they are now|`|W1BGqz9Faa	I don't think Orton would work well as a face. He should just be a self-serving tweener.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	No, because Orton plays a heel so well. He is so established as a bad guy that seeing him on the mic trying to get the fans to rally beside him just would be awkward. Cena on the other hand plays a babyface very well..he is O.K as a heel. A heel turn may be interesting to see him do in the future. But not anytime soon.|`|H5EYUh69aa	No ... It's mostly the older fans that cheer for Orton because they appreciate his talent and work in the ring.    But kids boo Orton because they fall in for the characters and all that.    Cena is a big money draw, amongst kids but the older generation boo Cena.  overall Cena is the biggest draw because kids cheer for him because of his former superhuman kind of character and now his whole   'good guy' routine.    Orton is a natural heel so making him a face woulden't bring out his best work, So WWE should definitly keep them as are.|`|zFB8PKjuaa	**** the little kids!!!!!

Not sure why these arguments happen, I like football (soccer) and football (american) and think we should all put aside our differences and get together to hate cricket!|`|BEu6LLrxaa	who cares|`|2payLxhxaa	Not offensive at all dude. Just be careful, American football fans tend to be a little over-sensitive. Too bad though, the players are cool. The fans should take a lesson from them.    American football is a better sport, but football/soccer fans are way cooler.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Steelers

pHpyUimHaa	Ed W is the only one close here... but not quite right.    Deore is the bottom-of-the-line component groupo from Shimano for 9 speed mountain bikes. (Alivio is only 8-speed for whomever mentioned that).     In years past, Deore LX and SLX were actually just LX. This year, Shimano has split it into two groups with LX being aimed more toward "trekking" mountain bikers. Light off-road duty but good for long hauls and such. SLX is now the true "off-road" version of LX. It isnt just a weight savings, SLX is much tougher and crisper shifting than LX now. SLX is a great alternative to XT but I wouldnt recommend getting anything lower than LX on any bike that will actually be ridden in the dirt... and, for the guy who said that the differences are only cosmetic, he must not have ever ridden anything other than a crap groupo cause you can immediately notice the difference between LX, SLX, XT, XTR, Hone, & Saint stuff, particularly in how crisp the shifting is at the rear-d.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	the slx  is lighter than lx. deore is slightly lower than lx.   the way you listed them is from lower to higher quality.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	the only real difference between LX and SLX is about 32 grams and a few dollars between the two. SLX is the group that is one up on LX and new for 09' in Shimano's lineup. Don't beat yourself up over the two the difference is negligible at best and unless you have Saint or XTR to compare too, you will never know the difference anyway. The Deore LX and SLX are basically only two and three groups higher than the lowest, Alivio.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	The difference is in two areas, the first is in quality the of the line XTR is built to higher standards and secondly is lighter. As you go down in level the parts tend to get heavier and the shifting not as crisp. The good thing is every year last years high end upgrades trickle down to the next lower level.|`|1jPiAkP4aa	It's mostly cosmetic. All the parts in the Deore family are basically the same, you won't see a real difference until you start looking at XTR which is Shimanos top of the line and Alivio, which is their bargain group. There may be slight differences in things like the pivot bushing material, the amount of metal carved out of the parallelogram, cage material....These things don't really affect the operation of derailleur. Unless you have a sponsorship that pays for your parts, go for the least expensive part that does the job you need. If you race alot, pick up the deore XT. It may be a bit lighter and shift slightly more accurately than the straight deore. If you like to poke around in the woods for an hour or so every other weekend, the Alivio might even work just fine.     Remember, the rear derailleur is a highly exposed part. All it takes is one little twig to get caught up in the rear wheel to rip the thing in half. Unless your prepared to go drop about $150 on a deore XT, spend 1/2 that on a deore LX. You probably won't notice the difference.

AA10272321	Lamar Hunt, architect of the AFL and owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, came across his daughter's Super Ball and was given the inspiration for the name of the championship game between the upstart American Football League and the old-guard National Football League.    "Why not," he wondered, "call our championship game the Super Bowl?|`|g2R7e2eVaa	It was called the NFL title game when just the NFL was in existence. When the AFL came to be and the two leagues merged, they needed a new name for the two leagues battling for supremicy. It was then dubbed SUPERBOWL.|`|0fQk2spXaa	The story goes that when they were trying to come up with a name for the Championship Game, the daughter of the late Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, was playing with "silly putty".  If you ever played with it, you know that one feature of it is that you can roll it into a ball and it will bounce very high.  The Hunt daughter told her daddy to watch her bounce her "super ball".  When Hunt heard this, he connected the phrase "super ball" with college bowl games to come up with the name "Super Bowl".|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Silsa1 has it right!|`|61Du6GNmaa	This is a pointless question!|`|ejrVotg8aa	The two above me are correct.

lrhOwySRaa	It has been reported that AC Milan is offering almost $20 Million for Beckham...Beckham's base salary is $6,500,000 with the LA Galaxy (Beckham also receives a share of ticket sales, jersey sales & Endorsements).      AC Milan is willing to match Beckham's guaranteed pay of $6.5 Million, however the issue is that Beckham will lose the rest of the additional money.  That is why it is rumored that Beckham has sent he lawyers to met with LA Galaxy to try to figure out a way to keep the endorsements (worth approximately $140 Million).

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	The difference between Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker, and those in the other Icon vs Icon Matches (except for Austin), is Michaels and The Undertaker are very talented well-rounded in-ring performers, the other icons were more gimmick and attitude than wrestling talent.    It's rare that The Undertaker has a bad match, and Shawn Michaels could have a great match with a mop.  These are two of the best in the business.    This match-up has grown to nearly legendary proportions; most of us want to see it.  I have no doubt it would be an awesome match.  If the anticipation for this match just stays with the fans then it should live up to our expectations.    But, if Vince turns the WWE hype-machine loose on it, then all bets are off.  Most wrestlers can't live up to the hype the WWE creates.  Even Chris Jericho couldn't, when he returned in late '07.  And Kizarny flopped.  Really, the only match in recent memory that did live up to the hype was Flair's retirement match at last year's Wrestlemania (mostly because Flair and Michaels are that talented).  Michaels vs Undertaker should be a great match, but they aren't kids anymore, they aren't physically able to do what they could 15 years ago.  A great match, to be sure, but I really doubt it would go down as one of the best in Wrestlemania history.|`|l0GWmWl4aa	It has the potential of being one of the greatest matches of all time, but it just depends on how HBK and Taker work in the ring. You have a great point about the Taker Vs. Batista match from WM 23 and how it was a great match for quality where some other Icon vs. Icon matches have not lived up to the Hype. Taker and HBK are arguably to 2 greatest performers in wrestling history so they have an opportunity to have one of the best matches in history. If this match does happen, it has a great chance of out doing the Main Event, whatever it may be...|`|fV9SawuPaa	Undertaker and Shawn Michaels are two of the most hard working wrestlers in the WWE. If they ever have a bad match, it usually is because of the lack of talent/initiative of their opponent. They've had FANTASTIC matches in the past, and although they are both older now, I still strongly believe they can put on a "match of the year".     As Dragon put it, this isn't a gimmick match, or charisma match, this is pure wrestling talent. Although Undertaker isn't known as "technical" he is definitely well rounded in all aspects of being a prowrestler. Shawn Michaels is a very skilled mat wrestler. So instead of seeing a few leg drops, and poses to the crowds *Hulk Hogan*, you're going to see hardcore, pure, intense wrestling. Which is what makes a great match in the first place.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Damn , I know I'm not gonna get BA seein' as how Dragon Answered , but -       Could it live up to the Hype? - That depends on How Much Hype gets Dumped on us by Vince , Michael Cole , & WWE Promos.    Best WM Match Ever? - Not Even Close.  Because for a WM match to be the Best , it needs that Certain , "Unpredictability" about it.  That is Why HBK/Hart at WM12 will Always be Viewed as the Greatest WM Match by Most People.    There is No Unpredictability in HBK/'Taker or any other 'Taker WM match for that Matter.  'Taker ALWAYS Wins , Period.  The Streak is NOT gonna End , No Matter Much People want to Believe it will.  It's Just Not.    One of the Top 5 WM Matches - Possibly.  Best Ever - No.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	No I don't think so. I just don't see it as a memorable match. HBK has outlived his wrestling usefulness. The undertaker can still bring it, but even he is a shell of his former self. It's more of a diversion while we wait to see Orton, the new "golden boy"|`|nQHkkR8Raa	I feel this match if on could be the best match at wm this year.   Yes it will be anticipated, so it will have to live up to it's expectations, which makes it more exciting, but also it will need to be a fantastic match. Both stars could be nearing the end of their careers soon, and this may be their last few wms. And since this match has been wanted for ages, it will need to show that both taker and HBK can handle it and put on a historic match.      Yes, i do think we will see quality icon vs icon this time, even if a match like this never happens again.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I think every single fan knows that Undertaker and Shawn Michaels bring the best at WM in every match they've been in. I know, without any shadow of a doubt, that Taker and HBK will give 100% and make this a classic beyond belief. This will rival any classic match WM has given to us    In regards to the Icon vs. Icon, 16-0 vs. Mr. WrestleMania, it will be better than any Icon vs. Icon at WM. Taker and Michaels are going to blow the roof off at WM and I think we're all gonna love this match|`|4tvI9WYjaa	to be honest i can see this one stealing the show   you have the first ever grand slam winner and mr wrestle mania shawn michael's vs undertaker wrestle mania streak and probably one Absolutely best today   and i think it go down as greatest match and hype off all time at wrestle mania   and off cause we see a great Quality match  vince would be stupid to not make it Quality match off the decade|`|NRs72Afxaa	You may never know Clown Prince of Crime. We might see JBL beat Shawn Michaels and/or Undertaker winning the EC. Personally I see this match happening where something will happen if Undertaker goes to Raw.  I think this match would go down as match of the night,or match of the year candidate. Not the greatest match in the history of wrestling.      Hulk Hogan vs Ultimate would but be consider a icon vs icon match. I would rather add Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair.      Do I think the match will live up to its heigh? Yes, if you remember back at the 2007 Roral Rumble when Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker were the two final persons in the ring people were in a riot as they know one of these two deserving wrestlers will win. So yes I think it would do well.    Would we see a quality match? Well Undertaker and Shawn are in good shapes and can still go so who knows but lets look at Ric Flair vs Shawn it wasn't the best match, but it was the best hyped and good emotions. So who knows.    @Dragon: I have the upmost respect for you even if you are a M.E.M member jk.  I agree on some points of your answer, but if we saw Undertaker vs Kozlov and JBL vs Shawn at WM25 then the match would un hyped and not watchable. Its WM Wwe's version of the Superbowl and if its the superbowl then you need to make matches that people want to see, matches that will make you lots of money, and matches that will have the right wrestling style. Lets look at WM24 last year. It was so hyped because people knew it would be Ric Flairs last match where he would pass his torch to Shawn Michaels. WM25 will be held in Texas and Texas is The Undertakers and Shawn Michaels Homestate and people know they live in Houston. They want to see this kind of match. If you were booking WM25 Gary you would listen what is best for business.  Plus WM25 is nowhere near sold out so this match would fill up some seats, but under these times its really hard. Just an opinion|`|6LQNK51uaa	So u have doubts on skills of Legends.....but I dont think so    I know their match will be the show stealer of the event....Taker and HBK r in good wrestling shape and I know they can carry anyone(even Hulk Hogan)with their skills.

vyHwhACjaa	For me it's never been an issue of his move-set, there are a lot worse performers in the WWE. What drives me to being a "hater" is how he has been pushed on us against our will from day one. I'll give WWE their dues, in the long-term the plan has obviously paid off as Cena attracts millions of kids to the show and adds a lot of extra revenue. But where does this leave us? Will all future superstars be hand picked super-faces driven down our throats by the McMahon family? Anyway I digress. The fact is if WWE ever want Cena to earn respect from the mature viewers, they have to take away his power over the rest of the roster. Give him some legitimate loss's, take him out of the title picture, perhaps put him in an IC feud and let him work his way back up the ladder like Jericho did in his re-debut. Take away his superpowers and make him a human being with strengths but more importantly... weaknesss.|`|5QQdpmnuaa	MMMMM HONESTLY ..THEY CAN TURN HIM INTO A FUNNY WHITE BOY WANNA BE RAPPER....AGAIN....THAT WAS FUNNY NOW HE IS BORING.....HE CAN COME OUT RAP....SOME STUPID RAP..AND EVERYONE WOULD LAFF AT HIM,,,,NOT WITH HIM,,,|`|xnhBucrjaa	i think they should do something else with him he always has the title unless he gets injured. he is one of my favorite superstars but the story lines of him being champion are getting boring i think he should lose the title and turn into a bad guy to spice it up some.|`|fdbERqCUaa	They should bring him back as the Word-life, chain gang soldier, doctor of thuganomics, choke on deez nuts, ruck fules, rap battlin cena back!    That was his success.    The cena now isn't as popular as he was back then because he has no "lines" like stone cold and the rock had (that's the bottom line/what?! & If you smell what the rock is cookin). He had "you can't see me" which he doesn't use anymore. His props, theatrics & gimmicks are gone(No more pumping of the shoes, no more chain & padlock, no more controversial hats).  He doesn't have any mike skills anymore. He doesn't break the boundaries with his moves anymore (like when he FU'd bigshow for the first time, tried the 10-knuckle shuffle on edge & christian, and would go into street fights and parking lot brawls to suit his thug persona). That is what has been lost with cena. Kinda like when kane lost his mask and chokeslam glove.    ....shame!|`|RskPXtibaa	he must turn heel that the only thing they can do|`|6LQNK51uaa	Underwear over tights.....that would make him more watchable than now(for haters only..he is watchable in reality)|`|KCDJgYrcaa	I Think He Needs A New Gimmick And Maybe A Heel Turn, New Clothes, New Music And In General His Character Needs Changing Because Its Really Boring  I Think The WWE Are Scared To Turn Him Heel Or Change His Current Gimmick Because Its Become So Successful With Fans And There Scared That They Could Lose Them|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	First Off , It's NOT just Cena.

Would That satisfy the Haters?    I doubt it.  It's the Same thing as with Jeff Hardy.  If people don't already like them or Respect them , They Never Will.  No Matter What they do to Change.    It's a Predisposition of Hate for No Reason Whatsoever.  Just Hating to be Hating.|`|xHMjlqrYaa	Theres nothing to be done hes beeing watched enought everyone knows him so it dont matter hes everywhere|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I don't think they can do anything really. It's one of those deals where you like him or you don't. Not much middle ground if you ask me.|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Teach him some new moves? Btw, what are those 5 moves he has?     Anyway, i think WWE will have to find a Way to make Cena appeal to teenage and older fans. 10 year olds love him, but Not many older people do. So, make his matches more exciting. Maybe add more entertainment factors into his matches and promos, such as him come in during other matches, attack heels backstage and stuff. Just little things that would make people like him, then if you like him you want to watch him, so he will be watchable.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	keep him off for several months and then get him a new gimmick for him|`|1z7M3Tntaa	change his moveset completely let him surprisse fans with something different i'm sure if he trained he could do it|`|NRs72Afxaa	I know John Cena has wrestling in his blood and is currently the heart and soul of Wwe. I respect him, but even I'm admitting I'm not a Cena fan.      If Wwe stops with the limit moves then maybe some of the fans would stop hating the product and the wrestlers. Wwe is doing this to keep them from injuring themselves. Keeping them limited does not keep them safe. If people are working out too much, or taking steroids then the wrestler will wind getting injured. It weakens the muscles, and bones.    Everyone has the opinions about Cena. I think John Cena needs something refreshing like having no more limited moves(that goes for all the wrestlers), just make him a gang member again face/heel, and let him use his real words on the mic. Just an opinion.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I fully agree with Undisputed Jerichos statement. Cena needs to be out of the World title picture for a while. Let him be in a IC hunt. Send him to ECW for a few weeks to build ECW.

So, we would have a kind of 3-1-1-1, leaving four players to employ in attacking situations, yet still leaving five defenders when needed.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	he is always better than hyypia and skrtel|`|XU1KaWXwaa	agger is very good CB only thing he has on skrtel is going forward and his left foot. but i think rafa just generaly trusts skrtel more. and anyway y are all our defenders rubbish at scoring from corners.|`|peFtORvUaa	I think lucas is good,,remember gerrard when he was 22?,,i think skyrtel is more reliable than agger.|`|Pfq2zRejaa	I do like agger but skrtel has been immense hasnt he|`|j3xwgrLBaa	Agger is a great player, especially on the ball, but in terms of an out and out defender Skrtel is head and shoulders above him, do you remember how he dealt with Drogba in the four games last year? Agger doesnt get near him.|`|deG4RMJhaa	i believe he can|`|1iSXOnZ5aa	yeah,i agree with you.    And i think players like Ryan Babel and Emiliano Insua should be given more matches to play.|`|tbgaqgQyaa	agger is injured again man. thats why he is not playing... he will play more regular when he is fit, coz he is a class defender!    edit - wtf are thumbs down for? you saying agger is not injured and im wrong?   http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_p...    think and research before you thumbs down answers, morons.

mG2BCZe7aa	Obviously Bryant was thinking about everything, the history, and of course Michael Jordan when he stepped on the court last monday. He summarized it clearly with these words: This is the last one left, this is the last one that holds all the memories. He wanted to outdo everything the legends before him did.    And in part he did record an awesome 61 point game on Madison Square Garden (although Jordan's double nickel stands out for me since he has done it vs. a more defensive minded Knicks team with Ewing in charge), and with this in mind James don't want to be outdone shone his star brighter by recording another feat that tied two more feats (Joined Jordan as the only ones with multiple 50 points in the garden and Join Kareem Abdul Jabbar as the only ones to do at least 50-10-10). So both games are conscious efforts.    As you know as well, Mike D'Antoni is no fan of defense, even his Suns teams never displayed great defense enough to topple the great defensive Spurs from their odd year domination. Knicks improved their offensive game greatly, but had to let go of their defensive tooth, obviously through Mike's prodding.    So the answer to your question is all of the above.        Hope this helps.|`|IBDPGahnaa	because they can|`|2b4c74857bc845e8711fbc100addc4cbaa	Because they are both dominant players. Both are incredible at  what they do. Kobe scored 61 points on a night where he knew he had to play well with the loss of Andrew Bynum.  Lebron James just plays the game with passion. He may have been a little more motivated knowing that Kobe just scored such a high number of points but I think he was just doing his thing and playing his game.|`|Pa3LKeBtaa	Kobe because its MSG and because I think he's trying to motivate the lakers to work hard so that they can beat the celtics this friday!    Lebron cause he's good.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	3 they both liike the historic arena and they know they are defensless|`|AA11691454	Just because they can, an wanted all the other teams to know what they are capable off. Great games both off them they are two gold medal winners, an that was a preview of the championship game those two are going to be in, and one is going to come out winning a ring at the end of this season.|`|I7ih9Mguaa	They love the New York atmosphere.  Kobe and Lebron historically get great numbers playing at MSG.  Before the game, they already had their minds set to give basketball's main headquarters in the world, in New York City, a great show.    It also helped that D'Antoni's team doesn't play any defense.  I mean, who's going to guard Kobe/Bron?  Nate Robinson?|`|GswnLKtQaa	1. because the of terrible knicks defence    2. because kobe & lebron are the best players in the league.    3. they want to make a statement to the league.    4. bignames usually put great performances at MSG.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Kobe has had some great games in the Gahden and he loves the big stage. When LeBron saw what Kobe did, he knew that for MVP votes he had to go out and do the same thing or he might have lost some points in the voters minds. And he did just that, lol.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	i don't know why kobe did it, but lebron did it to try to match kobe|`|wXxJUnLJaa	The Knicks just have terrible defense.|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the answer above.
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	well, if Matt Ryan doesnt win a playoff game next year, I think the Falcons should cut him because he isnt good enough to play in the NFL.  I mean he will have the same playoff record and number of games played as Romo, so come on, lets be fair here.  Thats how other people think.  Now to answer the question in my opinion.........Matt Ryan.  After watching him this season, I saw things that most rookies cant do.  Flacco is a good QB but chances are he will be the Roethlisberger type.  Flacco wont have to win you football games he will just have to manage them (because Baltimore always has a good defense).   That doesnt mean mean Flacco is bad, I just think if Ryan is doing these types of things already and making those types of throws already, then Ryan is the answer|`|KQvtAn76aa	i think it is  ryan  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://freeinternetcabletv.blogspot.com/|`|786QN5Aeaa	joe is not big ben, ben has played behind aworse O-line and has been successful because he can move well and makes smart decisions. Flacco right now isn't as good at making his reads and trys too hard to throw into coverage. Ryan right now is the smarter quarterback but both are first year so you cant really say right now|`|kcZZaNi2aa	I think Joe Flacco will make a better QB cause he gots a vetern team around him and the  defense  is one of the best in the league.  I agree he will cause hes like Ben.|`|ULw1777caa	Ryan, he has a much better arm.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Without the Ravens defense, Flacco is Joey Harrington. Ryan will be the much better QB. He didn't need his defense to win games.|`|7V79OMMHaa	Matt Ryan will probably be better, and he will develop into a Tom Brady type QB. He will have something like 15INTs/15TDs a season or something like that.    I agree that Joe will be like Big ben later on in his career.      Stay Cool|`|wxXguyK3aa	I think Joe Flacco will be better.  He will probably be like Peyton Manning.  They are both good, though.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Flacco will because he doesnt have a very good supporting cast so when he does he will ex;lode like Brady did when he got moss.
KNTofuxMaa	I love John Madden. I wish he could call every game. The man has forgotten more than some of us will ever know about football. I think his BOOM! is awesome. I think I have a man crush on Madden! J/K  LOL|`|ULw1777caa	He is great commentator, but he can go off sometimes and it is amusing really.|`|7V79OMMHaa	Because he does. But his "stating the obvious" usually is meant for those who don't watch the game often or are just getting into it and it actually helped me learn a lot about the game. Sometimes though he says something like "If Polamalu had gotten there just half a second earlier, that's an interception". Woah, really? I never figured that if a player stood directly in front of a football coming in his direction he would be able to catch it.      Stay Cool|`|6msce8FZaa	It depends on your take... He's been around a long time and can be extremely annoying. If a favorite player of his is in the game, he will talk about how great that player is all night. Case in point, every time Farve was playing, it was non stop how great he was.|`|TuVtWVFxaa	I really don't know why they do|`|Oes7TRNVaa	I don't know why people always say that. The reason why he does this is because he is reaching out to the new and the young football fans out there. Im 24 now and i remember learning so much of the basics from John Madden. He has a skill that none of the others has. That is why he calls the big games.    People fail to realize that young people are watching and need to learn the game.    I hope he never changes|`|4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	It's only obvious to these guys because Madden's told them what to look for so long.|`|e4WhipTHaa	He is a great commentator indeed but does go on tangents where you can tell it is going nowhere quickly.    My favorite Madden quote ever:  "The team who scores the more points is sure to win"    Class John Madden right there (From the Madden 2006 video game)|`|wApoUG2baa	Now here's a guy right here who hates that people say that John Madden states the obvious.  and BOOM there he goes.  he makes a great point about his insightful chalk talk.  see that right there? He thinks about what he wants to say and BOOM goes ahead and types it.      Now, he moves onto his second point.  Look at what he's doing.  he is going through his thoughts and making a great point that he tries to excite the new fans.  he's almost like Brett Favre with his quick decision making.  Its like he thinks it and BOOM his point is already typed on the page.    Now, in order to close his argument, he must give him big credit and BOOM there he goes, saying that John Madden promotes the NFL well.  Just look at that.  He...just...types...it and he makes his point.  To win this argument, you need to make the most points and here he clearly does.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	He is the bomb. I dont see hows hes not dead. Hes been over 300 pounds since the 70s and you know he lives on the road i dont see how he is not dead.

6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Wow... you have to be a kid.    225 and you only bench 305? I was benching 300lbs when I was a freshman in high school.    Sounds like you have some good size, but you sound soft. Seriously there are 180lbs guys throwing around 350 pretty routinely, so I wouldn't brag about a 300lbs bench when you are over 200lbs. Though weird to find a soft wrestler (as all the weight cutting that goes on).    Anyway, I would have a friendly sparring session with you, MMA style.  You could call it a fight if you wanted, I just would have rules in place to protect both of us.    I'm a decent sized guy, I bench more than 305lbs. Though I haven't done heavy lifting in a bit, I would probably put my max at low 400's, or conservatively say 385, I am pretty weak right now. But my Somatype allows me to keep muscle.. but easily gain fat :-(    Anway, lots of guys out here spar with people larger than you. I have fought guys in Judo and NAGA tournaments bigger than you routinely.    I would happily roll with you (grappling only), kickbox with you, box with you, or do MMA style sparring with you.    Seriously though if you are interested in that kind of thing check out this link: http://www.bullshido.net/forums/forumdis...    There are a lot of meet ups of Martial Artist to spar in a variety of methods in a friendly ego free, fun way. You can learn alot.    But yes, there are a ton of people out there who would willingly fight you in a friendly way, for money, or for sheer malice.    (Edit) WTF are you talking about Reaper? Emailing you. Unless you wanted me to travel some distance, or fight in a sanctioned match, I am down for friendly hard sparring anytime. Unless you wanted some sort of "No Rules" challenge, in which yes, I would not waste my time and risk injury without compensation, that is stupid.    I find most people talking about challenge fights end up coming with never ending excuses for doing so... Uhh, well there has to be no rules... or I can't travel... or "Only kicks allowed" or generally make up a litany of things even if you provide them with a location, a plane ticket, and give them the option of choosing when. I have no recollection of any kind of discussion with you, but then again I do get a few "E-Challenges", most of them patently ridiculous.. "Come to Arizona and fight me with no rules..."  some of them have been cool, actually have set up MMA fights, (smaller promotions love it when you can come to them with a pre made match up), and learned some cool stuff from guys and made some cool friends. So I am guessing whatever discussion that took place between us was of the patently ridiculous kind.    Again Reaper... what were you looking for?  Not saying it didn't happen, but if it was some sort of thing where you wanted a real all out fight, then I could see how I would want money involved, or if you wanted a MMA match (I can't do those for free, or unsanctioned as it risks my license). But if you wanted hard sparring, I would have been down.    Additionally I am sure I would also offer you alternatives.. i.e. Bullshido throwdowns, or mixing it up with an amateur fighter.    Or you just approached me out of the blue, asked about fighting me and I gave the standard approach I would to most "E-Challengers" which is I prefer to get paid between 3k to 5k for a fight, and I am around the N. Florida area, and you left it at that, as many internet tough guys leave it.|`|bB5d5YVeaa	I enjoy challenges.  What kind of fighting are we talking about?

The majority of them ended up not wanting to fight. Don't forget to email me as well. There's tons of people in the world that are just talk. Only few is bored enough to actually fight with you.    Another additional detail: I definitely remember talking to judomofo and I remember his profile picture. He didn't send me the email, I sent him the email. He'll definitely be reminded later on when he emails me again since I have the proof.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	If you're talking about grappling, my son would. He's 5'3", 145 lbs, and has taken on guys as big as you. He's won some, lost some, but most of the guys he goes against are about 5'10", 180 lbs. That includes some guys who've been high school state wrestling champs, and some who've wrestled in college.    There's another guy--call him "Mike"--my son practices with--about 5'6", 155 lbs--who just competed in a tournament in the absolute division (intermediate, no gi). First guy he went up against was probably 6'3", 250 lbs. "Mike" beat him, and a succession of other guys. And when "Mike" and my son roll, it's usually 50/50 on who wins.    Part of it, I think, is that size doesn't intimidate smaller guys like it might some others. Small guys almost always seem to end up practicing against bigger folks. And, as a result, they can easily adapt their style to go against competitors weighing 50-80 lbs more than them.|`|9z5NASypaa	I would like to watch you get your *** kicked by my husband jet li!!|`|f6OOxJQsaa	I will.  I'm female, 18 yrs old, I'm 5'8" and I weigh 135 lbs.  I have a (Sandan) 3rd degree black belt in Aikido.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	I would not fight a big guy for anything.  That said I would defend myself against you and this would be problamatic for you.  You may think my size and weight is nothing compared toyou.  However, can your balls bench press 305.  can your throat bench press 305. can you knees bench press 305  can your ears bench press 305.  I would attack you by kicking to the groin. Striking the knees and punching the throat.  I would also rip of your ears and poke out your eyes.  I would bite you and break your wrists.  You are big and that is a massive advantage and I respect you for that.  that said a true fighting style always see's the weakness in an attacker and strikes there first.  I would beg you not to hurt me and then when you start to laugh at me and make fun of me I would destroy you.  Simple.|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the answer above.|`|gBO908P6aa	Sure.  I specialize in Filipino arts though.  I can lay you over my knee and spank you with my rattan stick for your insolence.
U7BkuEU9aa	Sharapova and Ivanovic among the women and probably Marat Safin among the men. I'd mention Rafa too, but he's not *more* liked for his looks than he is for his tennis because not only his tennis IS amazing, he's incredibly well-liked because of that too...|`|3jBUJxOdaa	i think it is the case that their looks just add to the many reasons why audiences are simply compelled to watch and like (sometimes hate) them..but obviously it is their tennis why they are even watched and liked. andy roddick, even the fabulously beautiful and excessively gorgeous maria sharapova (yeah, even she!), and all the other good-looking tennis players of both sexes, for all likeliness, won't be even heard of despite of their supposed beauties without their talents and elegance on the tennis courts.|`|APvRSsGbaa	if you consider former players, then even Anna Kournikova figures in the list|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Sharapova, Ivanovic, Hantuchova, Nadal (in some cases like the teenage girl fan base who know shyt all about tennis), Roddick (same with the girls), Tsonga cause his big and cute|`|gWLhIoIiaa	ivanovic|`|RC3WoqFkaa	kournikova. sharapova. ivanovic.|`|6msce8FZaa	I like all the Russian blond players... I don't really watch the game when they play.|`|lEH7Xkb9aa	considering both Andy Roddick and Maria Sharapova have won grand slams i dont know if its all for their looks, it used to be verdasco but he's  been playing on a whole different level.
2s244jGgaa	Go down to a training session, thats the best chance you have of seeing him. Bring something for him to sign, and get him to record a happy birthday message for your cousin.     hes a nice bloke and would do that for you :)|`|mXFOru11aa	cool your his coiusin too bad your not his brother   and did you no he was taking drugs before the whole nation new?|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	I saw Andrew Embley record a phone message for some one at training, it was a bit awkward though because your put on the spot to record a message for someone you've never met.  The best bet would just be to head down to a session, highly doubtful but I guess it would be the only opportunity.|`|YcvKwRqiaa	I'd say your best bet would be to head down to a Richmond training session.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	good luck with achieving that.|`|8JXJTz2Maa	Go to an open training session, but even still good luck with that. The Richmond training supporters go to their training sessions like it's the resurrection of Steve Irwin!|`|bj6KFMyaaa	it might take you a while its gunna be hard for you mate but good luck to ya|`|tdG6NkEJaa	Head down to a Richmond training session. He will do it there.   His manager is Ricky Nixon btw.|`|yk8xpnK2aa	... good luck

I think he can make a dull game more entertaining.
jOM4bBMPaa	It's perfectly legal, and the person that gets hit loses the point.  The Williams sisters hit one of their opponents in one of their matches at the Australian Open & the commentators started talking about how some doubles teams try to hit their opponents to get points.  It's harder to hit a ball coming straight at you too, so it makes it easier to win the point for the hitter.|`|8e56e99cdf3904f078aeee841934a654aa	to the person who hit the ball. not the person who got hit.  It's legal, but it's a low percentage shot.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well it would not be cool either way to do...|`|k6M48eUMaa	No, its not illegal. If it hits the player, and just bounces onto the groud behind them, etc, the player that hit them with it wins the point, but if it hits their opponent and bounces back over the net, and they miss it, they will the point, so it counts the same as if you were to hit it with a racquet.  It happens to alot of doubles players.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Not illegal so far as I know unless it's done to cause damage. In fact the game is probably too slow for this to be effective. However in badminton it is an accepted ploy to try to hit the opponent as they can't move fast enough to return the shuttlecock. The court is much smaller and it works.
zDiK4ttPaa	As much it might hurt, try splits.   You can try pull ups  A good way to build up ab strength is to get into sit-up position and then keep your head about 3-5 inches off the ground and just hold it there for as long as you can. Do that every night and you should have more abdominal (ab) strength. You can also do sit-ups.  If you want arm strenght I suggest push-ups. Lifting would be okay, but thats more if you want to show off your muscles.    Hope this helps!|`|ARXaNb5Daa	Speed is something that you will need so get some endurance by running and upper body strength so you should start lifting weights and do push ups to get that chest and arm muscle
xE8orz6Daa	Steroids = Bad.    Take at your own risk.
tbgaqgQyaa	because ronaldo was shouting at the ref. and he was teasing ronney. rooney got annoyed of the teasing and pushed ronaldo which further cemented the referees case to send him off....    ronaldo then winked to the portugal bench to signal a job well done and that it was all premeditated. he suceeded in getting englands best player sent off. portugal went on to win the match on penalties if i remember correctly..    ronaldo got a horrible reception from the england fans when he returned to play for manchester united.   thats one of the reasons why he is one of the most hated players in the world. he is a cheat, and this was probably the highlight of it.|`|BGL2qhv8aa	Rooney kicked Carvalho which is already a red card offense. Ronaldo then went to the referee and pressurized him into giving a red card. He then went and teased Rooney. Rooney pushed him which made the Referee have to give a red card. Rooney deserved a red card, but after what Ronaldo did, Ronaldo deserved a red card too, at least a yellow.|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	Ronaldo told Rooney he wasnt gonna get anything later on that night, so rooney stamped Carvalho in rage    here:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjCneugi5...|`|j3xwgrLBaa	He put pressure on the ref by waving a pretend card at him.  Tbf he'd of probs be sent of anyway but as a team mate of Rooney he sould of stayed away|`|At9zfB1Jaa	he ran to the refferee complaining... so he felt pressured and he finally gave rooney the red... which he deserved

Come to school with some bandage around your ankle or something.|`|mTXHW3lzaa	Just run it, whats the big deal? Its only 100m, its not like your busting out a 10ker or something. Its only embarrassing if you think it is, just laugh it off, your not a runner, so you shouldn't care.|`|nrePUyciaa	Run it...but if you are that worried about your friends making fun of you than I have 2 suggestions. 1) talk to your friends about this. Bring it up while your talking to them and say stuff like this 100m is so stupid im not even going to try to run hard. I'm just going to go out there and jog it. Its so stupid we have to do this. play it off like you are really not even going to try. than if you don't run well they will think you did it on purpose that is good because than you won't get in trouble for not running it. 2) if you friends make fun of you for how you run are they really good friends? a good friend will help you out with this situation they won't make it worse by making fun of you or embarassing you.   good luck.
fHxpycJSaa	None. They've had two teams and didn't support either one. Besides, it's not like the NFL is suffering because it doesn't have a team in L.A.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Jets.  No one really likes them as much as the Giants in the NY/NJ area.  I don't care for them.  Anyway, why have two teams playing in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ?|`|6msce8FZaa	Any team but the Chargers...please take the Raiders.|`|ZlaxbI33aa	I think the Raiders should return for good. The fan base of the Raiders is still huge in L.A. I dont see to many Rams fans around anymore but I know there out there just not to open about it like the Raiders fans. I think the Raiders would excel with a new stadium and a still stable fan base|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Bills. THey have too many problems out there for the bills to really focus on Football. now that i think about it that would be a great idea.|`|gSgYDAEAaa	I agree with El Ar. L.A. doesn't deserve a team. If they do get one they will just leave in about 3-5 years because the city will not support them once again.|`|Wz2lTWJ3aa	Wow, your question is more thourough than most answers will be. I would say that there is a very good chance that the rams will go back eventually. SD or SF - probably not. I think their threatenings are just a play for a better stadium. I dont think the raiders would do well back in LA. They seem to be somewhat hated there. But, I guess if the Browns can move to Baltimore anything is possible.     The team you didnt mention that I would give an outside shot to also would be the vikings.     My guess is that it will be the rams going back, but probably not for another 5 years or so. Until then it will just be a threat used by 7 or 8 teams a season, "give us a new stadium or we will go to LA."|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	wont be the Chargers, dont worry.     Obvious answer is Rams or Raiders. Al Davis is an *sshole and too stuck in his ways so you'd go for the Rams whose owner is looking to sell.|`|6J5mQWj0aa	none u have one team thats all yall need in the bay area|`|Vj0chz3Eaa	If the LA market could not beat out HOUSTON for the expantion team, why should they get an existing one.    There is a reason Al Davis left the LA market. I don't see him bringing the Raiders backl.    The Vikings and Jaguars are two possibilities. But right now, my money would be on the Chargers heading north.... if anyone.|`|XTiMhga5aa	Im a Chargers fan, and I hate to say it but I think it might be them

4wPbaVzzaa	At the 35th over they would be replacing the ball and thats where the batting powerplay gonna be taken. If two batsmen playing in their 90s they would aim for a three digit score and won't utilize the powerplay properly. So he went for the Kill. Thus he sets up an example so that any batsmen should not play for their century but for the team.    This is another interesting bizzare amazing idea yet very powerful and genius thought of MSD|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Yeah, even i was disappointed to see him go 6 runs short of a ton! He looked tired but in his post match speech (during presentation party) he said he didn't want both the batsmen to go into powerplays in their nineties and play slow in order to achieve the ton. One had to take charge, so he went for the shot and unfortunately got out!!!|`|AA0L7X2Oaa	why dhoni not make 100 runs|`|NHADK454aa	maybe due to pressure or the destiny i was disappointed too|`|DVHfPdWIaa	he tries to be Sehwag, but he is not sehwag. but he plays well today  and one mor3e reason could be he is very tired in hot and humid conditions and wants to finish quickly.|`|rnY99OrGaa	Did you remember when Dhoni hit a six straight? He got out by the same batting attack. I think he was a little tired after getting 2 runs and three runs. I think he really thought he could have made another six, but the ball got the turning after it touched the bat it was unfortunate that Dhoni couldn't made ton.|`|MwjDCSLpaa	He did look tired. The commentators mentioned this too.  For a patient man  that he is, he shows a lot of impatience in batting.|`|vuRxFYMWaa	thats y it is a game buddy!!!!|`|ICm7FG9Haa	why do you feel like mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm   he is star|`|AA11088802	hes not a selfish player .. who worry about his century, he was in flow so he try to charge|`|gfxXikenaa	he thought about the team's importance ahead of personal milestone and tried to play fast.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	He hurried to make scoring rate more. He played a fantastic role but got out for a poor shot selection. He never gets tired|`|ocPlxCIeaa	He did not want to have a situation where two batsmen would be batting in their 90's during the coming up power play.  he wanted to score fast but failed.    Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I8Zq39igaa	That's really quite disgusting - although I once new a vixen who was paid to appear in a speciliast film doing that kind of thing. Now she's living on benefits with 8 cubs, all of them with different fathers    I'm happy to occassioanly pull myself off but that's as far as it goes matey. I suggest you do the same.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	African hunting dog?  Or common houndawg?  Depends on how intense they are.  Some when on a scent will run right past a female in season, others are less dedicated.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Oh, yes!  A dog is just one baby step away from a wild animal: the wolf.  In fact, DNA testing now suggests that there really is no reason to list the two animals as separate species!  Any cainide in season will distract the sh*t out of a dog, even a really good dog.|`|elxZLQLQaa	oh yes i had two dogs tat this happened to with coyotes and then she joined their pack and it was a chocolate lab so i recomend getting her fixed|`|DHIudHy2aa	Panama Joe is actually full of it. No domestic dog has ever been rated the same species of animal as a wolf. In fact, up here in Canada the Ministry of Natural Resources is debating on whether or not to classify a new wolf species as seperate from the Gray Wolf. It is also spelled "canids", no "E".

Edit:  I understand your hesitation, but, honestly, here's the thing...  My college had a yoga club and you couldn't pay a guy to go.  You could have called it Rambo's Power Yoga and guys would have still rather slit their wrists.  What you need to do is educate your audience to why they need to join your club (and part of that includes why you chose your name), so tell them why Yoga and Tai Chi needs to be part of their college expereince.|`|bB5d5YVeaa	It looks like it is unanimous - Cherry Blossom Yoga.  Since you are starting it in the spring, it will have a nice ring to it.|`|dB85SoMyaa	Cherry Blossom Yoga... is perfect. Ditto from the old guy ;-)    or     If you are just not interested then     "Your Schools Name" Yoga and Tai Chi.    or how about     "Meet Girls Yoga and Tai Chi".   The guys won't run from that name.    or     "Sadie Hawkins Yoga and Tai Chi".   Guys will run from that!   ;-))

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Benoit's, no question.    Not to downplay Owen and Eddie, but Owen's was a freak accident and Eddie's lifestyle led him to an early death.    Benoit's, however, brought to pro wrestling (and the WWE in particular) very negative attention from every form of media known to man.  Even the U.S. Government became involved.  And it cemented the opinion of the general public that all pro wrestlers are half-witted "roid monsters".  The public didn't care to learn anything more; they just nodded smugly, sure now that all pro wrestlers are menaces to society.    It was Benoit's death, more than any other, that caused the WWE to re-tool what they allow the guys to do in the ring.  The move-sets are much more limited, and there are no longer the rampant chair shots to the head.  A lot of people complain about that, but it was necessary to prevent more wrestlers from having their brains damaged.    BQ:  Benoit would have been ECW Champion for a long time, and ECW would have been on a more equal footing with RAW and Smackdown, instead of becoming the "developmental territory" for the new guys it has become.    Owen would have become one of the big stars after Austin, The Rock, and Mick Foley retired.  His talents and charisma are undeniable.  Multiple-time World Champ, no doubt.    Eddie, same thing.    There would have still been a "lull" after Austin, The Rock, and Foley left, but Owen and Eddie would have stepped into their spots and brought the WWE out of it's "low".  Benoit would have kept ECW a "major league".|`|Nmjjqoybaa	Hart  Benoit  Eddie    all 3 who died had affected the wwe the most and it made the people sad  .. there is no one that affected the wwe more than the other in my view .. they all affected it same thing    BQ - if they were still alive wwe would be so different    EDIT : when i say affected the wwe .. i mean that the fans got sad .. the storylines got ruined and etc and i dont mean it in a bad way|`|k2fFfNtRaa	I would say Chris Benoit, It was the most shocking and bisturbing. And the wwe didn't know what made chris do it, but the doctors said it was to many chair shots to the head.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	benoit's because if you remember, right before that wwe had that stupid thing when they said vince had died, but quickly dropped that when benoit did|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Chris Benoit's for sure. I mean the guy murdered his wife and kid then killed himself.    As tragic as Owen's and Eddie's death, they are not at the same shock level as what Benoit did.    Owen would have been better than Brett, there is no doubt in my mind. He would have had more than a few runs at the title.    Chris was a master technical wrestler with no equal at the time except maybe for Angle., He didn't need a gimmick, his pure talent and ability put him over with fans. He might have become one of the greatest Champions of all time.    Eddie brought out that nobody was perfect and sometimes you had to take shortcuts. His charisma was second to none. I think he would have his share of great storylines and title runs.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	With out a doubt the Chris Benoit murder suicide. It had the wwe on the news for about a month straight. With the whole why did he do it. In fact it caused a bunch of Nancy Grace Trolls in here.    BQ. Hard to say. All three were outstanding wrestlers. But I don`t know if the wwe itself would be any more or less violent if all three were still alive.|`|JYrvt5s8aa	Chris benoit shot himself Haha|`|ZLGr6pX3aa	I think Benoit because of all the controversial circumstances surrounding His and his family's death    I think Owen Hart would have went on to maybe be WWE champion i can't believe it's been nearly 10 yrs i was a big fan of his when i was a kid|`|l0GWmWl4aa	I gotta agree with the dragon. Benoit's death caused the business to be looked down upon more as not only was wrestling fake, but now it can kill people. I loved Owen Hart, Eddie Guerrero, and Benoit. They brought to ring something that no one else could. In my Opinion this is how the WWE would look if they were all still alive...    World Champion: Owen Hart  WWE Champion: Eddie Guerrero  ECW Champion: Chris Benoit.    R.I.P.|`|RskPXtibaa	owen and benoit     but eddies death really made the fans to cry and miss someone great|`|lxvWnjP8aa	I think Benoit's effected wrestling the most. Eddie's death was devastating but not like Benoit's. Eddie was not doing drugs when he died, he died of past uses of drugs and heart failure. Benoit went nuts off of roid rage because of steroids.       I think WWE would be awesome if all 3 of these guys didn't pass away. I would have liked to seen Benoit as the ECW Champion and Eddie as the WHC on RAW and Hart a good IC Champion.|`|kjCz5PYeaa	I'll have to say Benoit and Not Owen..Owen's death was really shocking..But these kind of stuff actually happen during risky sports.. It's part of their contract or agreement with the industry..But Benoit.. He shocked the HELL outta people.. i mean he had a championship match coming up before he murdered his own family and killed himself.. Now wouldn't that be a good reason for people to think about such an intentional death?|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Chris Benoit in my opinion because he had just been drafted to ECW and would have won the ECW championship that night had he not went crazy and murder his family and ended his life. The guy could brought prestige to the ECW championship and rating to the brand|`|mDuiiVN7aa	1.Benoit  2.Owen  3.Eddie|`|Z31fwTMcaa	Probably Owen Hart's, because they got alot of criticizm over the fact that it was due to a stunt gone bad.|`|PS5wELIpaa	It was Owen's it was just so sad. R.I.P. Owen|`|7OLg13B8aa	I think Eddie just because I liked him.|`|xnhBucrjaa	i think that eddies death was the one that impacted the wwe the most.and if they were still alive their would have been some amazing matches.|`|XVYRUzkEaa	Chris Benoit    BQ: The WWE would be different from what it is now|`|27pPeTDbaa	Benoit and Eddie for me. I could not believe the moment i found out these we're dead. I was in disbelief for about a month after. What really made it worse was a the week after Eddie's death i was going to a live house show to see him.     PS: Please, people who hate Benoit for what he did. Honour him as the phenomenal wrestler, than the killer. Thank you|`|qOWL5FK8aa	owen|`|3m9DQuDRaa	Let's go down the list...    Owen Hart - Died due to faulty rigging for an aerial stunt.  Fell 80 feet into the turnpost, breaking his neck.  The aftermath was a lot of fans giving respect to the company and family, and a bunch of lawsuits from the arena and Hart family.  Other than that, Owen wasn't a main eventer at the time, and though we missed him, we moved on.    Eddie Guerrero - Died due to an enlarged heart as a result of years of steroid and drug abuse, despite being sober for four years.  His death shocked many viewers, and because he was in the main event, also burned up a few shows trying to figure what to do with replacing him.  Two benefit shows were shown, and later Vicki Guerrero was given a place in the company to show their appreciation to her husband.  To this day, people in the crow are wearing EG bands on their arms, showing respect to one of the greatest minority wrestlers of all time.  We missed him, but we moved on.    Chris Benoit - Committed suicide after murdering his own family.  This cause a backlash on wrestling as a whole.  Vince originally made a benefit show COMPLETELY dedicated to him...  cancelling a whole show and losing millions in profits.  He took it back and later erased all mentions of Chris Benoit, showing they did NOT approve of his actions.  Steroid charges and drug charges appeared EVERYWHERE in the WWE and outside...  and to this day, people are STILL mentioning the heinous act he committed.  And the entire wrestling world has changed because of it.  In the end, this impacted the WWE way more than any other.    BQ-    If Hart hadn't died, there would be a chance that he'd be in the main event...  and even the possibility of Bret Hart's return to the WWE BEFORE his accident with Goldberg...  Owen could have truly been a turning point in the federation, but it was cut short.    If Eddie hadn't died, there'd be no real difference, other than Eddie being on the Raw roster by now...  and different storylines on Smackdown due to Vicki not being a part of the show.  Edge's opportunistic ways would have been used with Stephanie possibly, which would have definitely been a better combination in my opinion...  and Eddie may have become champ again by now.    If Benoit hadn't died, the wellness policy would definitely not have been upheld as heavily.  We'd still have RVD, Booker T, Chris Masters and possibly a few others in the federation...  and the company would probably have different problems on their hands because of it.  Not to mention the jailing of Benoit, because we never said he didn't kill his family...  just that he didn't die himself.  Things would have totally been different.|`|DUJnkYDzaa	I think they all affected the WWE differently but both Owen Hart's and Chris Benoit's caused controversy, Owen Hart's was how the didn't take the correct safety measures and Chris Benoit's was that the WWE wasn't correctly handling the issue of steroids like the should have. Eddie Guerrero's death caused controversy about steroids but really his really affected the WWE the most in my opinion because he was loved and respected by everybody, he was funny and talented and entertained us all. The same for Chris Benoit he was the best technical wrestler that ive ever seen since i watched wrestling, the WWE really lost the best wrestler they ever had when his incident happened.  I really can't say much about Owen Hart's death because i was only 5 or 6 when it happened and don't really remember how it affected everybody.  BQ: If they were here well for Eddie and Chris, because i didn't know much about Owen Hart, I think that the WWE would be perfect, I mean with all Eddie's funny stunts and him lying, cheating , and stealing to win (the funniest thing ive ever seen was when he did that in the ring) and the Benoit's talent I mean what more could you want. And then ECW wouldn't be so dull and boring.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	All had a major effect on the WWE, If I had to say which one had them going crazy it would have to be Beniot.After the WWE  cancelled Raw and did the tribute show,they found out he was the one who did the killing of his wife,child and then himself.Under pressure from Congress they ended up putting in a wellness policy.I do not believe they have ever mentioned him since (as Vince promised the next day at a ECW broadcast)                                                                                      Harts death did put egg on their face and Eddies death was unfortunate.Yet Beniots had every talk,and news show buzzing.All 3 were very good performers and would have entertained us for a few more years.Yet I do not know if the WWE would have been much different.The writers would have been the same.The stories for Eddie realley sucked all he did was wrestle Rey when they wore out one story they came up with another.They were bad stories as well.(Eddie trying to say that he Reys sons father and was suing for custody then ended up wrestling for him)                                           Chris Beniot was the ultimate preformer but was never great with the mic.He gave us so many great matches.He was on the downside of his career and was going to ECW to become champion.Then to train up and comers.If you listen to Brett Hart Owen wanted to leave the then WWF.Vince would not leave him out of his contract.So who knows what kind of stories would have been written for him.Vince could have had a grudge with him and gave him bad stories.Mainly to job for awhile just to show him who was boss.                                         So others took thier place and continue to enteratin us and lets face it.Santino can make one laugh.Jericho,and Cena have good mic skills.HHH,Shawn,Edge always give a decent match.Jeff Hardy    consistantly has people saying WTF.Yes I missed a few but I just wanted to say the show goes on.
c17x6L4baa	To actually answer the question, which I didn't state clearly.  I would prefer a perfectly called game with no excuses possible for either side.  But, calls going your way are a lot more OK than when they go the  other way.  I do not complain about that.    You don't complain when you are given the goodies your brother/sister deserved.   Pretty basic lesson learned in infancy. You might ADMIT it among friends.  You might even ADMIT it here.  Very few would go out of their way to mention it in a question that didn't ask about it.    "where was the talk of bad officiating when Hood got away with holding Kevin Curtis in the NFC championship game?"  It was being done by the other teams fans and, apparently, is still not forgotten.  You get noisy when you feel cheated not when you got the cherry.|`|ULw1777caa	You are right on bro.  I am amazed at how people are so blinded by their own team and how they can do nothing wrong.  The Cards did luck out in the NFC Championship game.  Curtis was interfered with and nothing was called.  People need to quit crying.|`|fHxpycJSaa	It's always a one way street. There's never a football game played, college or pro, that the losing fans don't blame the referee's. It's pathetic.....If you give me a thumbs down, you're probably guilty of it.|`|TuVtWVFxaa	No bad officiating is not OK|`|a6EndAPiaa	Did you actually understand what Mike Pereira said?  He said that the booth official had a long enough time to take a look at the play and determine that an official review was not needed because the call on the field was right.    Stop reading whatever you want into things.  The play was a fumble, it would have always been a fumble, and it always will be a fumble.  An official review would have changed nothing.  Yes in a perfect world Pereira said there would have been a review but let us face facts the only reason he said that was to placate the critics.    When are people going to get over this?  Folks are never satisfied.  There is concrete proof that the call was correct and people still want to say that the officials made mistakes.  The right call was made and the right call being made is all that matters.|`|KNTofuxMaa	OMG!!! People, please quit the bitching about the officiating! Even if, by some miracle, the NFL admitted that the game was horribly officiated, it wouldn't change anything. The Steelers are still going to be the champs and that's the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Kaine I've watched and reviewed that play over a dozen times now. Something is wrong with Mike he must be cowering under pressure or something because that play is obviously a stripped ball.    I'm getting tired of that crybaby Warner and all that Jesus stuff. He was given the ball back earlier in the game, when he stated he was throwing a forward pass - and he was. So he deserved it back. It was his ball. But that play at the end he had the ball stripped before he was over 50% of the way in motion to throw the pass. It is so obvious to me that the play is a fumble all this complaining is starting to make me sick.    But you know I'll put up with it because that is football. But Warner is starting to particularly irritate me with all this "Jesus" stuff. It's beginning to look like this: "I'm a Christian and believe in Jesus Christ therefore if I say I was going to throw the ball then I deserve it back."    That's a disgrace.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	personally I didnt even question that fumble. I thought it was a fumble.  There were other calls in that game that were ridiculous to me.  I just wish ONE Steelers fan would admit this instead of calling people names.  Im in noway saying you are one of those people, just stating my opinion.  Periera DID say it was a fumble, I saw it.  He also said Holmes should have been flagged.  Bring that up to a Steeler fan though an you hear "quit crying".  So the VP of officiating in the NFL is crying too then?    I do agree with your question though, it is hypocritical.  I can freely admit when my team doesnt deserve to win though.  A few years ago on MNF the Cowboys should NOT have beaten Buffalo and they did.   It was plain luck|`|wUooHVU3aa	Calling a pass play on first and goal from the 1 - that pass being intercepted by Harrison returned for a T.D. - that bone-head coaching move cost this team a championship. Even if Arizona hadn't scored on three attempts and kicked a field goal, they still go into the locker room at half-time with a chance in catching Pitt in second half.    All officiating calls aside, bad coaching puts good teams in bad positions. One bad call like the missed booth review on Warner's pass attempt is a very slim and risky thing to count on, at the tail end of a very tight game.    Coaching cost the team, not the officiating...|`|taEGA9PNaa	of course its ok as long as your team wins. two people of differnt teams in same room see all pentalties different. i get bad rating on yahoo if i disagree with someone here - it's same thing. football fans are all a bunch of gloaters when they win and crybabies when they lose. at least the players, who actually played and participated int he activity have a right to speak. The rest of us are all just a bunch of loser wanna-bes.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	just so you know it WAS reviewed every play that is close is reiewed by the ref upstairs and if he thinks it was a bad call he calls down to the field judge and tells him he want the refs to take a better look at it to make the right call and they say that he didnbt call down so he agreed with the call made...even though i dont think the call was right this is just what the  FACT is, it was reviewed|`|lPDHMOVZaa	I was pulling for the Cardinals in the Superbowl... and I admit I was getting frustrated with the refs in the 3rd quarter... but after watching all the replays, the refs made the right calls.     When the 4th quarter rolled around, the refs made the right calls against the Steelers as well. The guy taunting/starting fights on the Cardinals side lines after the play (can't remember who it was... Clark I think) and Harrison's mugging...     All-in-all I think the refs did a fantastic job during the game. The one thing I was a little surprised by, as you stated, was the no review on the Warner fumble... I think if anything the call would've stood do to inconclusive footage, but the play was awfully close to Mr. Brady's against the Raiders a few years back, and I feel they needed to watch the replay... a simple 2-3 minute review would've prevented weeks of skepticism and most likely would've resulted in the same call... so why not do it?    ***As for the "roughing the holder" call... I don't see why so many people are complaining about that one... I mean Reed hit the field goal for 3 points... then there was the penalty which gave them the first down... then the Cardinals defense did what they should've did on the final Steelers drive and shut down the Steelers offense... then Reed hit the field goal again... for 3 points... that penalty had no effect on the out-come of that drive... unless Cardinals fans want to complain that the extra 30 seconds completely winded the defensive linemen...***|`|2payLxhxaa	I love it when my team gets a bad call in their favor. Even if I see it's bad I just pretend I saw something else just so I can be annoying to fans of the other team.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	No|`|Wz2lTWJ3aa	As someone who was really pulling for the Cardinals I must say that I do find a lot of the recent whinning really annoying. There is a human element to refereeing a game. And if the game is so close that you need a call to go for you instead of against you to win, then you didnt play well enough to win.     That said there are a few things to point out. In the Eagles game there was pass interference on Curtis. There was also a kick that didnt go out of bounds that was called against the Cards, and in my mind that was bigger.     While watching the superbowl there definately was a feel of a whole lot of close calls going to Pittsburg, at least to a room full of Cardinals fans. And yes, there were calls that went against Pittsburg too, but at less pivotal moments. Everyone complains about the end of game Kurt warner fumble. So what. I think bigger were the roughing the holder penalty and the noncall for holding on the long Holmes pass.     Do I think those calls should have gone differently - yes. Do I think "Pittsburg brought their own refs." - no. Do I think that the refs lost us the game - no. That fault would go to the Cardinals defense not stopping the Steelers last drive - with a side helping of blame on Warner throwing his 100 yd interception. So, I do say to the other cards fans out there - there is a human element to officiating. It wasnt deliberately biased. And the Steelers won because the Cards didnt play well enough to keep teh game from coming down to needing marginal calls to fall our way,
NXwzuv3Paa	i definitely think it would draw a crowd. but of course i would root for sting a Little more than foley. ive like sting for a long time. but foley can really put on a show. it would be a very good match.|`|zb40cLwOaa	I think since they've already had Sting vs. Kurt Angle...Sting vs. Foley wouldn't make much of a difference...TNAs problem is that they don't advertise their ppvs or anything on other stations..if they did advertise more I garantee they'd have better ratings and more viewers.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	It would draw, two legends. I would think out of loyalty that Sting would go over but you never know anymore.
l3AZzVfMaa	I absolutely hated the ABA gimmick but according to Taker that gimmick was mainly his idea and that is how he acts outside of wrestling. A lot of fans hated it, but that was his gimmick that he created. Its funny that I actually stopped watching wrestling because of the ABA gimmick, Taker was mainly the reason I bothered watching for that time. Once he returned back to the dead man, I came back to wrestling.    I loved the Ministry of Darkness gimmick but Taker actually hated that gimmick and said that it was the worse gimmick of his career, even though it was very popular with the fans. Ministry of Darkness was great and upheld that "mystery" of Taker that he is known for.    BQ: If Lesnar came back (by some random act of God) he would get toyed around with (like Orton) from Taker during his Dead man run.|`|kYgblA7Faa	aba|`|NXwzuv3Paa	Deadman|`|Z10Oed2faa	American bad *** was a joke,and was terrible idea     plus does a ginger.biker dude who was all about giving respect really suit the undertaker name    1998 Ministry taker was he best Gimmick     though i havent saw him do a tombstone in a long time|`|zb40cLwOaa	Deadman is much more dominant. Everyone should know that. Once ABA tried to turn heel it got weird and didn't really work out.    As for Lesnar he would not dominate Taker if taker was deadman. He'd get tombstoned and that would be all.|`|B85pe4Izaa	No doubt his Bad *** gimmick was d best. He used to have best mic skilld in those days and was involved more with the Mcmahons. Dead man gimmick is also very good but ABA was d best one.    BQ- No use of pridict cause lesnar plays REAL game in UFC|`|JQGaok6haa	Deadman|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Deadman because while ABA was an interesting gimmick it was not Undertaker. but Ministry was the best.    BQ: No now that he is back to the Deadman gimmick he could take Lesnar out.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	His win-loss record is better as the deadman. However, I prefer the ABA.    The Deadman would go over now because Brock would have no intention of staying with the WWE. It would make no sense to have Taker lose to a guy who's just passing through.|`|lr68XuMFaa	ABA = American Badass  Definitely Not, Taker would make Lesnar tap just as Frank Mir made him|`|sqfjfR3iaa	The Ministry of Darkness may have been his strongest gimmick. The Legendary Deadman Gimmick may be his second strongest gimmick.    Brock Lesnar has learned striking skills and submission holds to go along with his grappling skills. It would not be a much closer and better match. Lesnar would probably win this time, because he is younger, stronger and has much more time to train and prepare for the match. All of this is hypothetical, because Brock Lesnar is not going to leave the Ultimate Fighting Championship to return to Professional Wrestling. He is the reigning and defending UFC World Heavyweight Champion.|`|3I6YUfg0aa	I believe the 'Ministry of Darkness' was the best gimmick, so dark, mysterious, and had a whole group that would help him to win matches. Gangrel,Mideon,etc...    BQ: Lesnar would beat Undertaker in his American Bada-s-s days, but not in his Deadman days.

GkFlzMHMaa	Eh? Why would you ask such a Question, how do you lot feel about me. Are you a woman, cause that's the type of emotions a woman would show, they are more fussed on how people think about them..Do you really care what people think about you on a forum, that would suggest you are really insecure, and looking for some-thing in your life. Well you are not going to find it here..    Any-way you made a comment about me, in a Q yesterday. Some-thing about me being argumentative, i don't ever recall having a go at you on a personal level, i only react to when people make these sly comments about me and what i say on here, and you could say, that i should give you a dose of my mind games. But i will give you a free pass on this one, because i know I'm argumentative as you put it. I like to call it debating. After all what is a forum for? Yes indeed it is for debating. Its not a place i need to find friends, or get opinions of others about my personality that may or may not be me in reality..I do not know what your deal is here yet, you seem to suck up the woman a lot, so what does that tell me? are you really a insecure woman looking for friends, or are you looking for a woman to shag?

jwm0kQvNaa	What's wrong with tackling like yourself?  Or with good fundamentals?    You need to gather yourself, keep your eyes on the ball carriers' belt- they can fake you with the feet and the head, but not the waist.  Keep that head up!!  You can't tackle what you can't see.  Lead in with your shoulder, and hit him near the gut.  Make sure you wrap up the runner with your arms.  Your forward momentum will help take the runner down.  I can't stress enough that you should keep your head up- you can be paralyzed by leading with your head.  Lead with the shoulder.  I'd write it 1,000 times because it's so important.    The worst thing is to see the professionals try to take a runner down by just ramming into him.  That's just plain stupid.  For every "cool" tackle you see like that, there are at least three where the runner gets away and makes positive yardage.  Don't be the person that gets on TV by making a poor tackle and allows a game-winning TD.    Again- tackle like yourself.

Kh0d5Uweaa	Cowboys    *Somehow get rid of T.O (trade, release anything)    * Have Jerry Jones stop signing thugs    * Have Jerry Jones lay down his pride and stop trying to do everything.    * Get a coach with some gonads or have wade phillips step up.    * Have someone step up as a team leader.    * learn how to play as a team instead of being selfish.    * stop flirting with the media and just stay out of trouble and work on their on field playing.      The Cowboys have more than enough talent. But they need to get rid of pride, selfish attitudes and stop being prima donnas and just play football....|`|CdlSbr0aaa	Ravens fan.    They need to get a big play wideout and add depth to the secondary and the def. line because they are getting pretty old in those two areas. Joe Flacco needs to have better chemistry with more of the wideouts so that he's always not looking at derrick mason to throw to. they should draft darius heyward-bey in the first and go for victor harris in the second because he can play both corner and safety if needed which would give them amazing depth. they also need to get back t-suggs and ray lewis. and if possible bart scott but that will be kinda hard cuz all will want big money. overall they should be a better tema then this year if they do the right moves in the offseason.|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	steelers need to work on the offensive line.  it started to come together towards the end of the year, but if they want ben to stick around long enough to see the end of that contract they gave him, they need to work.  ben has 192 career sacks, compared to eli's 120, with the same number of games played.  anyone else see a problem there?    they should also work 1 on 1 with limas sweed.  young lad blew a perfect bomb ben threw in the ravens game this post season.  if he's the next great WR for the steelers then he's gotta learn how to catch the ball first.      and lastly, they need a new punter.  sorry mitch, but your 25 yard punts aren't cutting it anymore.|`|tVEm2eJXaa	From a Texans fan. I think we should definitely try to build up on our secondary. Hopefully we are able to re-sign Dunta Robinson and just pray that the Raiders don't give Nnamdi Asomugha a big contract so we could try to sign him, but it's most likely that we won't be able to sign Asomugha.|`|lbdpHcc9aa	Eagles fan...    Even though they made it to the NFC championship game, there's a lot of pieces they need to contend in the East next season.    The main thing is another reciever...not even a top rated wideout like Anquan Boldin.  I'm actually happy with Desean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, but it would be nice to have a tall, physical reciever to go over the middle.  I wouldn't mind if they ended up taking someone like Michael Crabtree in the draft, but I doubt he'll be on the board that long.    Another big need is another running back.  Don't get me wrong, Brian Westbrook is the man, but he's been suffering a lot injuries, and a big bck to split time with him would be a great addition.    An offensive tackle or two would help.  Jon Runyan is getting close to retiring, and Shawn Andrews needs to take his Xanax and get his head together.    Same goes at safety...Brian Dawkins is by far my all time favorite Eagle, but he has lost a step, and for whatever reason the Eagles despise having too many veterans on the team (Jeremiah Trotter, Deuce Staley, Takeo Spikes, ect).    Give me all those things, and I'll definately be happy.    And NO, not a new quarterback!!  The Eagles wouldn't be where they are with Donovan.  If any Eagles' fans say otherwise, there's obviously something wrong with them.|`|fHxpycJSaa	The Bears need a QB, as usual, and some wide receivers. Their receivers are the worst in the NFL.|`|a6EndAPiaa	Another top WR and a re-vamped offensive line (Redskins)|`|KNTofuxMaa	The Cowboys need to hog tie Jerry Jones in his skybox and stuff a sock in his mouth so he can't say anything else stupid.

Charles Grant and Will Smith need to show why they got those big contracts because the past two seasons they sucked.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Packers 6-10 (terrible), but an advantage they have over other teams is they have enough to work with to change things around. They need to start throwing short passes again in order to keep Rodgers from getting sacked and convert third downs. I'll admit the long ball is exciting, but Rodgers ends up rushed and on the ground too often.  Hopefully with new defensive coaches we'll see a change. They need to move the players around. The defense was weak in '08, they need to work at strengthening it. Not impossible, a keen eye will do it. Especially filling the middle, plug the holes. Some of this had to do with injuries, but seriously, all teams have injured players.  Special teams, they pretty much stunk. They need to fix this as well. Get the guys to move, it's unbelievable that we went from 7th to 25th in rankings in one year. They need to look at why that is.|`|6tGYe5roaa	The main thing the Giants need to focus on is the WR situation. They need to decide what they will do with Burress.

Move Hester back to returning punts and kicks.  2)  Improve the pass rush and stop the heavy blitzing packages; that's what put the Bears pass defense in the dumper.  3)  Get Adrian Peterson or Garrett Wolfe more involved in the rush game, giving Forte a chance to recoup more easily during the game.  4)  Focus on minimizing injuries (if possible) with the secondary; it seems like they get hurt more often than most other teams in that area.|`|5RXq5mn3aa	ya i think so  and my team is   giants  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://freetvshowsontheinternet.blogspot...|`|lPDHMOVZaa	San Francisco 49ers.    Most importantly, they need to take the best available offensive lineman (preferably tackle) with the no.10 pick in the draft... and maybe even bring in a young free agent or two to help shore up that O-Line. Joe Staley and Eric Heitman are the only guys on the line that should be starting every down. Chilo Rachal is coming into his own and can hold down the fort, but the other tackle and guard positions need to be addressed.     Another solid pass rusher would be huge for the defense... whether they find a gem with the 11th pick in the second round or they find a young prospect in free agency. If they can get another guy opposite of Parys Haralson, that would keep opposing offensive lines honest.     A big, powerful wide receiver. Anquan Boldin would be the answer to my prayers... however the chances of that happening are minimal. If the 49ers could land a receiver that fits the mold of Anquan Boldin on the first day of the draft, opposing defenses wouldn't be able to stack the box against Frank Gore and Mike Singletary's smash mouth approach... not being able to stack the box against the 49ers could be devastating if they can shore up that O-Line.     Other needs... a Nose Tackle that will absorb blockers and free up Willis, Spikes and the rest of the linebacking corps which is the strong point of the 49ers defense. A quarterback for the future... Hill, in my opinion, is the man for the next 1-2 years... I think it would be a waste if the 49ers took a QB in this years draft and threw him into the fire right away. I have no problem with the 49ers taking a QB in the later rounds (4th-7th) and giving him time to adjust to the speed of the NFL. Hill is 7-3 as a starter... no, I don't think he is the future of the team... but he is good enough to get them into the playoffs at least, and to compete in the NFC West (how hard is that? Especially if Warner calls it quits).|`|Cppi6kRFaa	A reliable QB and a big name receiver. (Vikings)

iPWKzzQtaa	I haven't read they were a contender...not sure about the local Atlanta newspapers.    Remember the days when they would go into Shea in a key series, with the Mets just a game or 2 back...and Atlanta would get 3 of 4 games or at worst a split. Now I can't see that happening in NY or in Philly this year, can you?    Franceour, the guy you mention, comes with no guarantees, he was in the minors for a while last year and was lucky to come back up quickly...even then he had an off year.    It is fairly clear that the Mets have improved. Philly probably about the same...there is simply no way for the Braves to contend unless they were beating those teams head to head.     I think wait 2 years. But Chipper will not be as good then and who really knows about Lowe.....having said that, the pitching should be better this year.|`|vweoheAvaa	The pitching staff should be good this year(assuming there are no major injuries), but you're right in that it will be hard for us to contend in the NL East.

If you don't support your team through the hard times, then you never fully appreciate the good times.    Young Man Utd and Chelsea fans have missed out on so much of the joy of supporting a team.  If you expect to win, you're never truly happy with the result.  If you support a worse team, you'll sometimes come out of a 4-0 defeat and be delighted with the performance.

Now they all sit back and talk about how great they are - even though none of them ever played the game.

LnJjS8BRaa	Go speak with a doctor.    There are a number of causes or reasons for why you may have blacked out. Every answer here should suggest you see a doctor, anything else is dangerously negligent. You don't want to ignore a symptom like blacking out. If you're worried about looking like a wimp, professional fighters will see a doctor for the smallest of reasons because their health determines whether they can be cleared to fight.    See your GP as soon as you can get in. When booking your visit mention that you blacked out and they might push your visit up.    As a general rule, drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Dehydration is one of the biggest causes of malaise that I've seen.    Good luck and train safe.    EDIT:: Looking at your other questions I'd have to wonder if you'd be drinking before rolling.

Gasol is not as good at Center and Mbenga and Mihm suck, but if you really watch the Lakers you would realize that they are just as good when Gasol and Odom play with no one being a true center. It is just a different style on defense when this is the case in that they are not as aggressive in overplay near the paint as they are when Bynum is waiting in the middle. I hope that he is back for most of the games in April, but if not they will still be OK.|`|AA11488609	yes|`|GswnLKtQaa	yes, they still have a roster good to be title contenders. ok bynum is out but the lakers got to the finals last year without him and they are still the top team in the western conference.|`|rEafx4QTaa	not without andrew bynum, he brings a seven foot toughness and athleticism that the lakers will need when they face the cavs or the celtics in the finals|`|AukGqk17aa	Yes    every team has a chance to win     OKC has a chance    LAL have and they will win    LAL=2009 champions|`|vzH7f7V5aa	No.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Not against the Cavs they don't.

By that i mean the winners of the matches are scripted beforehand. Also spots (big moments in the match) are also worked out between the wrestlers before hand. For example if you saw the Jeff Hardy vs Edge match at Royal Rumble, there was a spot in that where Chavo was put through the table by Jeff, this was actually worked out beforehand so they knew what to do.  Also story lines such as The HBK / JBL that is happening right now is not real and it has been thought out months before it happened by the WWE creative staff.     However the bumps they take in the ring are real. Not necessarily the punches and kicks but the moves off the top rope and suplexes actually hurt. However the years of training the wrestlers have means that they can do these things safely.    Hopefully this has cleared things up for you.|`|KQYY12OVaa	Fake

KNTofuxMaa	Perhaps the most injury proned but, not overrated. I think the term overrated is overused.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	I agree with Zoso.  The DB Williams is terribly overrated.  He's 6 feet tall, but plays slow, can't cover anybody.  He's a decent tackler, if you count the horsecollars (I don't).  He should definitely be a LB- take advantage of his (few) positives, hide his (many) weaknesses.    Now look at Sanders.  Tiny (5'8"), but everywhere.  On the line for run support.  Back deep in a Cover Two.  Out in the flat.  You can even see a statistical decline in the Colts' D when he's not there.  What about Williams?|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	THe most overrated are Roy williams, Mcnabb, Eli Manning(arguably), the other Roy Williams, Larry johnson, the whole Titans offense, the steelers D at times, etc.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	whats your reasons that makes you think hes overrated?|`|eDCyle05aa	In 2006 when the colts won the Super Bowl, they didn't have Sanders for pretty much the whole season and they had the worst rush defense in the NFL. When he came back in the playoffs the colts D shut down all opposing running backs they faced including Larry Johnson who I believe had less than 30 yards that game. Yeah, it sounds like he is definitely overrated, NOT!|`|7V79OMMHaa	Dude, I been saying that forever now. Not only is he injury prone, but the safeties in their defense basically just do run support 75% of the time and need to pass coverage ability what so ever to actually succeed. When he is in the defense is better, but in the opener against the Bears I seem to remember Forte rushing for 100 yards and he was in the game. Not to mention he is injury prone......    He is a good run stopping safety, but there are safeties in the league that actually do a better job. The fans will justify him not being able to get 100 tackles in one season because people run away from him, but what about the other hard hitting safeties that manage to get 100+ tackle seasons as well? Oh well, good luck convincing anyone that he is overrated........      Stay Cool|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	Really?  Bob Sanders is a solid defensive back that makes the opposing team's offense work harder to go against Indianapolis.  he is far from overrated.    For overrated, looking at output and stats in comparison to time in the spotlight, Chad Johnson has moved himself up the list of overrated players quite quickly.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No... not even top 25 most overrated... sorry.     Most injured? You might have a case there.|`|qZLSMccqaa	Even the casual fan can tell a difference in the Colts' D when Bob is playing.  He is one of those players who makes everyone around him play better.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Not more so than Reggie Bush. I still don't see his worth. I admit though, I am jealous of the girl he snagged. She is fine as hell. You all know who I'm talking about. (KK)|`|vQeKxmZyaa	I think quite the opposite my friend.  Sanders is highly underrated.  One the hardest hitting safeties in the game and has excellent football instincts.  By far the biggest playmaker in the Colts defense.  He's no interception machine like Reed but that's not his game and the Colts don't run the Raven's D.    The me the definition of overrated is never living up to the hype.  Sanders gets nowhere near the hype of Reed or Polumalu (each very deserving of the their hype) but is every bit on par as a safety imo.|`|op4fEbEVaa	Nope he's the best safety in the NFL|`|XTiMhga5aa	I think he is a little overated. Only because 2 years ago in the playoffs the Pros were saying the colts would beat the Chargers because of Bob Sanders and he did absolutely nothing. Then this year playofffs he did nothing.

OfNTLq3Qaa	If the rosters were combined again then we would see less of the mid-card talent.

Every year there are new people you can see at house shows.  2. Every year there is a little shake up and the race for the titles is more exciting with the chance of people changing brands.  3. Its a LOT easier going on the Wrestlers as they no longer need to be at every show and so it means that action in the ring is better.    However I really dont like the way people keep switching brands just for one week only. But apart from that, i quite like the seperate rosters|`|bagXMU7oaa	No because WWE wouldn't be able to hold all the promos and superstar, they would have to make it like 5 hours and Wrestlemania is like 4-5 hours long, and by the way did you forget ECW on purpose?|`|JjRhlOg5aa	nah, i like them seperate.|`|B8hOqrENaa	I like separate rosters.

GswnLKtQaa	yes, first he makes the lakers frontcourt deeper because odom can come off the bench. second he's lakers best shot blocker and lakers defence in the paint is much more stronger with him around. third he's a low post force down the paint.before the injury 23 ppg, 13 rpg, 2 bpg last 6 games. bynum makes the lakers much better.    but it's really not a problem for the lakers because with their current roster they are still title contenders. lakers are also a deep team.|`|rEafx4QTaa	lakers are deep, but the loss of andrew bynum is significant not just because of his scoring, rebounding and blocked shots, but because he brings toughness as a 7'0 footer to the power forward posistion. The finessse lakers were really bullied on the inside in the finals last year by the likes of Garnett, PJ brown, posey, leon powe, and kendrick perkins. Now the lakers even without bynum are still the favorite to win the west but if the lakers should happen to go against that frontcourt of the celtics again, or against the cavs 7'0 trio (ben wallace, illguskas, and varajeo, heck throw lebron in there too) then they may struggle.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Of course it will.

If he comes back at the start of or in the middle of the playoffs, then there is more a chance that it will be a distraction and could cause rotation issues for the team. If he does not come back this season at all, it will take away some of the ability for them to allow others to play more aggressive defense away from the basket and also lets other teams double a bit more quickly when the Lakers have the ball.  For the playoffs, the biggest issue could be fouls. Without Bynum, that is 6 less fouls that other post players have that they can take and as much as I like Ariza and believe that Odom can fill in, I have to admit that Mihm and Mbenga do not belong on the court.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	idk if you can count but 8-12 weeks in only two to three months.  but yeah they will miss his presence in the middle. hopefully he can have an early comeback like farmar had. but for his size its different. we can still get them wins though|`|9yzkcA4Taa	Lakers is a team not a one man team    25 free credits for the first tree who signup now on http://offto.net/GirlNakedCam/|`|nZwT15Xraa	Yes it will affect te Lakers because instead of them have both inside and outide game they are having to go with there outside game with kobe. That will affect them in the long run because kobe isnt going to be able to do that every game.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	Not as much as others think. Despite his play of late, The Lakers went to finals withotu him. His strong presence will be missed, but they have enough to recover, sadly enough. I still say Lakers are team to beat in West, over my Spurs.|`|AA11488609	Yes, but the Lakers are still deep without him.
obPSaYf3aa	People don't know anything about Barry Bonds and his personality.  For someone that actually has met him numerous times at work (EA Sports) at SF Giants/MLB functions (ASG afterparty and inside the AT&T Park Locker Room) and in my own neighborhood (San Mateo/Foster City, CA), he's as normal as they come.      I'm only sick of the name calling and constant chatter from people too young to know about George Herman Ruth, Roger Maris or Henry Aaron, the numerous drugs and vices they had and the fans acting like they actually lived with them and witnessing their "pristine" lives.       100's of professional athletes (not in MLB alone) have used PED's in different forms, Barry included, but why do the fans think they're above God and all of a sudden "steroid cops" when it's not their business?  Did the fans pay for Barry's, Mark's, Sammy's steroids and not receive any compensation for each HR hit?  Did the fans have a contract with the players that for each HR record broken, they would get a cut?  Is that what is enraging so-called "fans" when true fans would not care about it.     Barry is MLB's steroid scapegoat and that's just the way it is.  You can place him in court, go through a perjury trial, but he'll just keep the records until someone else breaks it.  The issue is not whether he took substances, when he took them, or how much he paid for them, but rather what he told the Grand Jury.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It's not about taking steroids.  It's just evidence and not the main topic in court.  Give him a break!|`|TaAAHxFOaa	I agree dude. I'm tired of hearing it as well.|`|NcqPn0Kgaa	It will take Bonds admitting that he used steroids and to recuse himself from owning the all-time home run record. All the guys who have used and it was proven should have their records expunged. I know that it is probalbly impossible to do that, but all the old-timers who arrived at their career totals legitimately are being cheated as well as us fans.|`|2payLxhxaa	I'm just tired of complainers - both ways. All you guys do is complain he's being harrassed or he should be thrown away. He's done - who cares.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	1. A confession.  2. An apology to all of us true baseball fans.  That's it.   Well maybe a little humility would help.|`|zMvGnlMraa	When he admits it.  Bonds and McGwire still get a lot of press and flack because they have not admitted it.  Giambi admitted it, there was dissappointment for a little while and now everyone forgave him.  Everyone just hate Canseco anyway but I dont think anyone is really angry at him that he took performance enhancing drugs either.  And Ken Caminiti is dead so I think most forgave him since he paid the ultimate price.  When guys keep lieing and not admitting it when everyone knows they did it, it will continue to stay in the news.  Bonds should have just said in the beginning, I tried it, it wasnt banned, Im sorry, it helped me recover from injuries faster and I just wanted to help my team.  But no, Bonds is a complete jerk, he never wanted to help his team, he simply does everything for himself.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Because he lied to congress about it.  McGwire used a supplement, Bonds is as guilty as Clemens!!!|`|fHxpycJSaa	He'll have plenty of time alone in his prison cell. Perjury can not be tolerated.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I actually am a Bonds fan.  Untill its proven in court, im DEFINETLY not going by what ESPN is telling me.  That station has become a joke and makes up stories now!  I dont understand why people dont hate Clemens as bad?  Ive never been able to grasp that.  Another thing, people like to say "everyone was doing it".  Ok, well if thats the case, it was an even playing field and Bonds records should stay then right?  This "new evidence" they have in my opinion is  NOT going to work.  A "retest" showed he used steroids but years ago it didnt show that ha?  Come on.  THey are just taking this too far now.  If he used and lied, Ill lose all respect I have for him as a player, but untill that time, I do think he is the best of all time.  Who am I to judge a man without seeing or hearing the facts?|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Jail time........ once he is locked away we won't have to hear about him for days|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Because Bonds is actually going to court.    As a topic, yes, it's pretty well run its course, but as a matter of jurisprudence, everyone should have an interest in seeing the wheels of justice turn fairly.    -----  Giambi has admitted to NOTHING in public -- I challenge anyone who thinks otherwise to cite published statements given by him -- and fans really, really need to stop filling in the blanks for this fraction of a man.    To the grand jury, yes.  To baseball fans, no. He has not.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Bonds (allegedly) lied to a Grand Jury.  If that is true, he must go to jail - just like everyone else who lies to the Grand Jury.|`|80OPj9gGaa	Going to jail for perjury. That's what it'll take.    The guy's a cheat and I won't be happy until my kids don't know his name except for being a guy who went to jail for lying in front of a grand jury and who might have played baseball for a while.    You can't cheat at baseball. It's the greatest game in the world. You certainly can't cheat at baseball and keep a record like career home runs.    Giambi, Canseco, those guys don't hold any sacred records like Bonds does. McGwire will never get into the Hall. Bonds needs to be stripped of the record and banned from baseball. Then we'll stop talking about him.     Because that's what he deserves, to be banished to obscurity and forgotten.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	He would need to fake his death & disapear to Mexico! That is the only way I see him being left alone!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Because he is the "Homerun King"....................He would be left alone if he would just MAN UP and admit the truth..................Everyone knows that he is a liar.|`|POriIGJtaa	he never said he didn't use steroids  he said he never knowingly use them before the rule change  and yes I'm tired of it too|`|bXGwTQy6aa	i think they just want him to officially retire so they dont have to worry about  him being a distraction...they left Big Mac alone and the rest of them because they retired
f32y9K5raa	If Baltimore could get their hands on Jeff Niemann than they would go after him. They could also get a whole lot more young pitching off of the Rays (many of their young prospects our running out of options this year).  Orioles will almost definately not sign any high profile free agents (such as Dunn and Sheets). Their best bet is to take players who are out of option or trade Sherril and Roberts for a lot prospects.|`|KnY8HXtPaa	They have been looking at Braden Looper. And they also just signed Ty Wigginton.|`|botH6rIQaa	I think the O's are pretty much done,  they have addressed most of their needs,  within their budget,  and they are now prepared to sit back and see what develops.  As in years past,  hoping one of their prospects has a break out season and one or two of their new free agents duplicates success of the past,  will keep the O's at the bottom of the AL east.  They have been doing this for 10 years now and I think Angelos is perfectly content with it.|`|VhNmMWbXaa	I think they should go after someone like Adam Dunn.  I know they have been burned in the past trying to sign some big bats, but they need one.  Think of how good Markakis can be with Dunn protecting him in the lineup.  Developing Markakis is crucial for them|`|8f5b3518bbb478f324587b828536a78eaa	I really doubt the Orioles will make another signing, but if they do make a move it will probably be to trade Brian Roberts.
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	leave it. I dont know why this year all the sudden people are complaining about it. I can provide some stats below from a few years ago and I dont know why people are complaining.  I would HATE it if they changed it.  They pay a defense for a reason.  They are making MILLIONS of dollars to do a job.   Keep college garbage rules out of the NFL.  Next thing you know people will be calling for the NFL to change the receiver rules to have just one foot in bounds, not two.    Total no. of overtime games (19742003)    365  Both teams had at least one possession   261 (72 %)  Team won toss and won game   189 (52 %)  Team lost toss and won game   160 (44 %)  Team won toss and drove for winning score   102 (28 %)  Games ending in a tie   15 (5 %)|`|Bgpk4npBaa	yes i think the rule should be changed and what i would have them do is:   Kick field goals back and fourth untill someone wins like a hockey shootout but with 45 yard FG's or they can change it to how college OT is give them each the ball and the 30  and go back and fourth till someone score and the other team doesnt ]] either one is better then what they do now (my opinion)|`|ZlaxbI33aa	I would leave it as is. If you lose the toss and can't win with defense then you don't deserve to win. Theres 3 parts to OT. Offense, Defense, and special teams and you have the opportunity to win with all 3 in OT|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Keep it as is... the coin toss is a fair way to determine who gets the ball first... if you lose the toss... play defense. It's not rocket science. Please explain to me how it's the coins fault if your defense allows the team to march down the field and kick a field goal...     If you want to change the coin toss in overtime because of the odds of the team that wins the toss also winning the game, than you'll have to change the coin toss at the beginning of the game too. Why? Because the team that starts with the ball scores first more often than the team that doesn't start with the ball... and teams that score first, win more often than teams that don't score first...    So, if you're going to change overtime because of the odds after a coin toss... you have to change the whole game...     It's called defense... play it!|`|786QN5Aeaa	keep it the way it is, if your team lost in overtime, maybe they should have tried harder during regulation|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I'm a season ticket holder for the USF Bulls, and the NCAA overtime rule is the way to go!  Not sudden death, but a series of possesions where the one team has to match the other team.      After the first team scores in overtime, the other team has to match that score, or better it!  If they better it, then the game is won;  if they match it, then a second overtime begins.  If the teams match again, then a third overtime begins.  I've seen our Bulls beat the Louisville Cardinals and TCU Horned Toads in triple overtime (3 OT periods).   No ties are ever posted, unlike the Eagles-Bengals this year.    edit: GO BULLS!|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Change but wont happen|`|qThmcR1Aaa	College overtime is a joke. It's not real football. It artificially inflates the final score. Plus, no game clock, ball at the 20, then the other team has to match what you did? That's as gimmicky as the shootout in the NHL. Just play the game the same way you played it for the previous 60 minutes: You have a kickoff, and then you have to drive down the field and score. What's so wrong about that?    I have no problem with the NFL's overtime system. The defense has to play, too, after all. The defense can even score. I just don't see the big deal. You can't have a situation where team B has to match what team A does. That just prolongs the game too much, and the risk of injury skyrockets, the more tired the players get and the longer the game grinds on.    Frankly, I don't even have a problem with ties. Neither did the NFL until about 35 years ago. Before that, overtime didn't even exist. If you were tied at the end of regulation, that was it. Game over. As long as the league kept its current rule that a tie counts in the standings as half a game won, I'd have absolutely no problem with getting rid of OT altogether.    The idea of having the two opposing sides charge at the ball was actually tried in the XFL, in place of a coin toss. The idea didn't last too long, because it was just so dangerous.|`|6tGYe5roaa	The OT rules do not bother me that much. If your team cannot win in the allotted 60 minutes, then you shouldn't be complaining all that much. However, if I had the choice to change one thing about the NFL, it would be the OT rules. I think that each time should be allowed one possession. You each get one chance to score. Sorry I couldn't think of a "goofy" response to that question but this is how I would like overtime to be played.|`|J3kfQtViaa	ch-ch-ch-ch-ch leave it as it is|`|UgnMjtYDaa	Simple. if a team scores in OT. the opposing team would get one drive to score equal points or more.|`|u8pVLV53aa	The rule needs to stay the same because the defense needs to play hard if they want to win because if your team will get the ball back they won't try as hard as they would usually.|`|9ZYtLjV7aa	I used to like the nfl overtime rule, but then they changed the college rule. I've loved the college rule ever since because it give every team a chance to win! i think its the only fair way to decide which team is better. bot teams have to play offense as well as defense. I hope this answers your question!|`|XTiMhga5aa	THey have to change. OT is a joke compared to college level OT|`|KNTofuxMaa	I like the sudden death. The only thing I would do is eliminate field goals in OT. You have to score a TD to win.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	No changes.  The NFL OT rule is the way to go.  It works, it's exciting, and it gets all phases of football involved.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I hate NFL overtime.  They should change it to the NCAA system.  Each team gets it on the 20 yard line and then one team tries to score.  The other team must then try to match them or score more than them.  This keeps going until someone breaks the tie, and after the second round, everyone MUST go for the 2 point conversion.  It's much more exciting and it's fair.
1mKJFfieaa	Lol...I dont think so...But Sania Mirza isnt that great at all...Venus and Serena Play doubles and many other player in the top 10 play too...But I think tha its something that is coincidence you know they get into it and find that its grea tto play so maybe thats it!!    Edit: Lol at potlyfe...I dont like Mirza either!!|`|1w5blbobaa	Well ur right 4 most of the players,like the players who can't survive in singles try in double.  Im really not counting the Hopman cup & Davis Cups & those events where the top players do play doubles bt they play more 4 their countries.  Bt real exceptions are there like the WILLIAMS SISTERS where they are equally successfull in both singles & doubles.U can take the Wimbledon 08 where both of them went in the singles final & as well as in the doubles,they won doubles & obviously in singles 2,recently u can take AO 09 as an example.They hv 17 singles titles betwwen them & 8 doubles titles as well.  Again there are Brayan Brothers pair who don't tried in singles ever,they play only doubles.    Bt most play doubles when they are down in singles.That's true.|`|rKbJ51XIaa	No,well look at it from this side.Rafel Nadal is world no.1 and he used to play doubles with his Spanish friend Verdasco in matches...|`|pmzkNT3naa	No. Doubles is a great gamet. Many great singles players have distinguished themselves in doubles as well. Watch a doubles match some time. It could be very entertaining|`|EpaBmmxlaa	You know the Williams sisters are a couple of the best doubles players and also Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka...and it may just be me but the aforementioned seem like some pretty good players....    Btw Justine why do you have such a problem with Mirza....thats 2 times now you've called her out.
ppoD3p2Saa	Yes im goin to have to agree, he has a great serve but his groundstrokes are horible. His forehand has way too much topspin and it sit for his opponents, he hardly ever flattens it out, and don't even get me started on that sry backhand that he has.    @(|`|2M11CfPHaa	I think he started that way, but he has been sufficiently humbled since 2002 to put a lot of work into other aspects of his game.  His backhand is bad, but it used to be terrible, and his movement has improved a lot.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	You don't maintain yourself in the top 10 for so many years if you have no game...sure, there are better guys out there, but he's good too!|`|uuHrf7cGaa	No - not at all. He may not be a well rounded player to play his shots. Over years he has played and add new to his game - but it still not good enough to take the top 2-3 players. If it was only his serve game(BTW - those ain't cheap points either - it is technique) he would not have been in the top 10. We have big servers like Isner, Korlovic - these 2 are a lot of serves - but have little overall game.   Andy is far better than the 2 I mentioned, but lacks mental toughness and overall game. In AO he looked very fit and played some good tennis specially against Djokovic in the 2nd and 3rd sets. But he cannot win against Federer - he needs more overall skills and more top spin when needed and hit flat and hard when situation demands to knock top players.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I used to think the same thing. All he was/ is known for is his huge serving. I think he had a game, just these days people are outplaying him so he relys more on his serve|`|FYd1ndVxaa	No. He just has a huge serve that is too huge that seemingly other aspect of his play is nothing. But he improves his play somehow, he just lacks good game plan variety and is obstinate to believe that he can win with his huge serve and powerfully-hit shot. He just needs to be smarter to get himself out of losing against top players. Seriously, Roddick really plays great besides his stubborn game.. But I can see he's improving his game in Australian Open this year|`|5nzgNWalaa	There's no question he relies heavily on his serve.    In the past, if his opponent returned his serve low and in the middle of the court, he had trouble putting it away. But his game has improved since then. His volleying is much better and he's mixing it up with slices too. His forehand has always been good. His fitness is now much better.     I think Jimmy Connors was good for him as a coach. But his backhand is still rather weak. All in all I think he has a very good serve with a good game but I wouldn't consider him to be like a great tactician on the court like say Martina Hingis.
BNHeJm8Maa	She has made a lot of money for her family thats for sure. But it has come at a price. She didn't have a 'normal' childhood and her parents just turned her into a cash cow really! So maybe it ends now....she could get used to life away from the court for the first time.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I don't know. She might. She's not the best player to ever enter the game, but she's nowhere near as bad and disinterested as Kuornikova was, and besides the top 10 has been constantly changing for a while. Nobody can hold on to the  1 position for long and it shows that there's nobody who's completely dominant.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Yes, women's tour has become quite unpredictable, and there are plenty of challenging players, Zvonzreva, Wozniaki, Jankovic, Dementieva,Azarenka, Safina, the Williams sisters, Dokic....When Maria returns from her a rather long injury absence, she will have a much tougher time to stay in rhythm with top guns. She may climb back to within 10 if she manages to win more Slams. Yes, she likes the fringe benefit comes along with her looks that the media seeks,which I don't blame her for. Pro tennis life is relatively short and she wants to collect as much $ as possibly can...don't blame her.  Again tennis seems Sharapova's   1 priority, if it weren't for her 3 Slam titles even with her photographer's dream look, she woud have not been noticed as a sports model. There are plenty of striking, gorgeous models in the world. And she knows it. Her path somewhat resembles  Kournikova's, but Maria and her father seem to have taken tennis very seriously unlike her compatriot Anna.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	I disagree in some point. She and her father may be very driven by the world outside of tennis. But she loves tennis and desires big for tennis. I believe she's capable of moving back to the Top 10 should she be more single-minded and stay free from injury. When she's into it, when she's determined, when she's focused, she can beat anyone. That's what she has done in winning three grand slams. I hope she will return soon. Most of the world would definitely not like her to retire that early and want to see her fight.|`|1MNPS8xEaa	She is too talented, she will come back and dominate|`|2M11CfPHaa	I have no doubt that she will be in the top 10 again.  I don't believe for a second that she fell out for any other reason than injury.  I'm not sure she will ever be  1 again, or win a slam again, but she will definitely be in the top 10.

4gZYucHMaa	The key is to get a good pair of shoes, find out what type of foot you are and get the shoe that works best for it..if you're flat footed or high arched etc..Go to a good sports store where they know what they are doing and have them size you properly and invest in a good pair (not something cheap but halfway priced for starting out)  http://www.asicsamerica.com/sports/runni...    WHen I first started it was just a plain old cotton shirt and shorts, I still keep that mentality for my winter runnning--cotton. You can pick up these clothes at any Walmart type store--once you get really into it, then invest in a few runnning clothese that sweep moisture of your body (dri-fit, cool-max) but for now save your money.    Start off with a goal, I went out and tried to run around the block, if I had to walk, I stopped until I was ready to start running again--I listened to my body, I found that was the best. Once I could run around the block without stopping, I extended it one block and so forth  check out this link for a starting plan (go to the bottom of the page)  http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/...    Key is to have fun with it, don't stress about it and just keep yourself motivated anyway you can--I use an Ipod but other people use a pal to run with.|`|AA10241450	Running you really only need some good socks and shoes.  Later look into coolmax shirts, shorts or sweats that will wick away your sweat.  If you get bored - try running with an MP3 player or use a Nano with Nike+.  The best tech gadget for runners is a Garmin GPS device with heart rate monitor to track your heart, distance and speed performance however not necessary unless you like stats and are training for running events.      The best way to start is a combination of walking and jogging.  Really in the beginning you can just walk or hike and try to get up to 60 minutes.  The more time you can put into it the better!      Later look for a lake around 3 miles or river path or favorite running trail and walk & jog and later building up to a run the whole way.  Try to remember it's best to be about 60 to 70% of maximum for jogging.  Good luck!|`|AsOno1Wdaa	Keep it Simple!!      1. Don't turn your running into a chore. keep it light & happy!  2. Give yourself a break every now and then and cross train with aerobic exercise, cycling, skating, swimming, etc.  3. Stretch before and after every run.  4. Invest in a good pair of shoes and don't be afraid to spend some money. If you have the correct pair of shoes, it will prevent a lot of injuries and allow you to keep running. Replace the shoes about every 400-500 miles.  5. Keep yourself hydrated at all times and and don't run right after you have eaten.  6. As you advance in your running, push yourself by adding short sprints along your run. Choose a car or telephone pole and run harder until you reach that goal. As you build up make the distances you choose further away. When running up hills don't look at the top of the hill as it can depress you. Keep your sight about 10 ft in front of you and lean into the hill.    7. Refer back to  1 at all times and Good Luck!

I also called it ping pong way back when I played the game at school, YMCA, and friends garages.  I learned that there is a higher skill level which opened my eyes and appreciation for the sport and these more skilled players.  In fact, you can see it on TV occasionally.  Table Tennis is one of the sports contested at the Olympic Games.  I hope this gives you a better understanding.

EDIT  Yeah Matt Le Tissier was my first thought but i'm afraid there is no "possibly" about it, Gerrard may well be a quality player but Gazza was in a different league!|`|j3xwgrLBaa	Gerrard and Liverpool will win it one day.....    Any English player before 1992 didnt win the Premiership so throw them into the hat|`|Pfq2zRejaa	he is the best english player yes|`|rHzjLXMaaa	Hey dude!!     Its not like that, Gerrard has the chance to win the premiership specially this season if they keep their win.    Gerrard is the best english player at the moment.

iPWKzzQtaa	They are not free agents. Where do you think they might go? Spring training, I would guess.    Cards don't have the pitching...but they have money tied up in  Carpenter..having cleared out Mulder. My opinion they need 2 established starters...Chris Carpenter and one more...or 2 if Carpenter can't start the season.    Glaus is out. They have 3 power hitting outfielders...2 of them are very slow footed.     Whatever the Cards need, I don't think they can get enough to contend.    Houston is ahead of the Cards and Cubs are ahead of Houston...and Brewers might again be better..they are younger and faster to begin with.|`|c6q3EERdaa	They'll likely go to arbitration with the two of them - and the Cardinals haven't gone to arbitration since 1999, when they won a case against Darren Oliver . Ludwick is asking for $4.25 mil (while the Cards offered $2.8 mil) and Ank is asking for $3.3 mil (and the Cards are offering $2.35 mil). Neither are free agents, but it could have a slight impact on who the team could sign in the future.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	Mozeliak said that he really wasn't serious about shopping Ludwig. With Rasmus possibly in the mix there should be much competition for the outfield spots. Where this will leave Chris Duncan I don't know.    I would agree that we need pitching. However I am glad that we re-signed Lohse. I think that would give us two established starters assuming Carpenter is healthy (which I doubt). If Carpenter is not healthy then ownership needs to get someone...FAST!!!    Glaus should only miss one month but that whole situation was mishandled.    Unless another miracle ala 2006 resurfaces this team will be in the middle of the pack I am afraid.|`|S0A9lz17aa	well currently they are going to arbitration, but they need to resign ludwig and try to move ankiel for a starter.  That is the need that they need to fill currently.  They should go get a free agent and let Dave Duncan make him great like he always does.  Also a reliever wouldn't hurt.
LEQowzHCaa	I think they can. If Sundin plays a strong aggressive game and Henrik and Daniel Sedin are at the top of their game...    Then they will win    Luongo has to play a sharp game too|`|9GzkVwfGaa	blackhawks are winning it.|`|786QN5Aeaa	doubtful, canucks gotta figure out their lines, they don't have a lot of chemistry right now|`|AA10068004	I agree with sarge. Only thing that has me worried is the Hawks very well could be drained by Saturday. They are in the middle of the NHL's longest road trip for any team this season. Saturday will be their 6th game in their West coast swing. They are 3-1 so far on the trip but they played some very good teams too and play Calgary tonight. As much as I love the Hawks I hate to say it but its not unlikely that the Cancucks could be facing a very tired Hawks team by Saturday. Vancouver is decent and this can only help them further. As long as Vancouver plays on the same level as the Hawks they have a great chance. But like sarge said... if they can't get their act together then Hawks should win it.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	Well, the Canucks did knock off the Hurricanes last night (by ONLY one pt), but they still are having a real problem with defense and we don't know where the hell Sundin went (?) but he sure ain't showin' up mentally. Of course, everyone's talking about Vigneault getting turfed, which is making the Canucks scattered a bit. I think that the Hawks will be tired from their roadtrip (they are doing well), but since I am a true blue Flames fan (go Flames go!) and know that they will kick the Hawks' **** tonight, the Hawks will be tired on Saturday. That being said, we're taking the Hawks over the Canucks on the game Sat. That Canucks win last night was teensy and we just don't have enough faith in the Canucks play, ever since 'BobbyLou' came back from his injury. They need a LOT more work to shape up.
92jr44kFaa	In my opinion, they are both great firearms.  I've owned and carried both of them, and I think they are the 2 most reliable weapons I've ever owned, next to revolvers.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	It mostly comes down to personal preference. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm just not comfortable with the Glock in safety terms--with no manual safety and a much lighter trigger pull than a conventional double-action. I've fired them and they seem like high-quality pieces at a decent price. I just couldn't carry one. There have been several instances of accidental discharges among police officers who switched to glocks; keep in mind that police officers have far more weapons training than most civilians. I'm a Marine veteran and I have a couple hundred hours of weapons training, and I'm still not comfortable with it.    The main "selling points" of the Glock are simplicity of use and reliability. My .357 revolver exceeds any semi-auto on both counts, and the DA trigger pull is heavy enough to keep me from being nervous. Yes, you lose some capacity--but that is primarily a concern for military and police users. Civilians rarely need to fire more than one or two shots in defense; especially if they took the time to get some training so that those shots count!    H&K makes some fine pistols (albeit expensive), and the offer several trigger configurations (DA only with safety, traditional DA/SA, etc.) I really like the USP, don't have any experience with the P2000 but the primary difference seems to be ergonomics. I'm not sure if that justifies the extra price.|`|Sru8JnBBaa	Heckler and Koch make a fine gun, no doubt. However, I have to lean toward the wizard engineer of Glock. Somehow, they made a gun, mainly composed of a composite polymer, that is lighter in weight than most of its peers, and yet fires with less recoil.    That's a real feat! They are low-maintenance and very easy to group a tight bead on a target.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Glocks are typically significantly less expensive than the H&K equivalent models. Generally, the fit and finish on the H&K and H&K are better than a Glock. Arguably the inherent accuracy of the H&K is better and there are definately many more factory options for the H&K. There are more aftermarket options for the Glock.    Otherwise it is mostly a fit issue in the hands of the shooter. I have both a Glock and an H&K. I like the H&K trigger better, I like the lower profile of barrel to hand of Glock better.    Both are definate top end firearms.    Thinkingblade|`|8MUj24s6aa	Both are well made and reliable weapons....I do not how either of them feel in my hand.    If they feel good to you I would go with the one that feels the best in my hand and wallet.    I like Springfield Armory XD. Quality, reliable, inexpensive, better feel and fit.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	To me, it's a coin-flip as far as the quality, but most H&K handguns do not fit my small hand.      It's a problem with people like me;  when I take a proper grip on the pistol, my finger cannot properly engage the trigger!  Especially for a carry gun, both engagements have to be correct.  You need a proper grip of the weapon, and your finger should be able to naturally reach the trigger to the second joint of the trigger finger.      With the H/K, Baretta, and many other DA pistols, I just can't reach the trigger, but on the Glock (I've had two, the 23 and now the 19) I have no problem.  Of course, with SA Autos like the 1911 and Browning Hi-Power and clones, that's not a problem, either.    See which gun fits your hand the best before you shell out $$$ for one that just won't fit.  Good luck!

OfNTLq3Qaa	Storyline is that HBK went broke, lost it all in the Market. He needed a job and JBL hired HBK to ensure that JBL gets the title belt.

If Michaels wins he gets to be free of JBL and is given the money he was going to be given from JBL in one huge wad of cash. But if JBL wins HBK is his..... FOREVER!!      Kinda strange but i have loved this storyine since it started...|`|EVBA0GFOaa	HBK invested all his money in the stock market. As the market went down he did as well.    He is now broke. HBK tells the wwe fans when  JBL comes out and offers hima job.    Shawn has been cheating to help JBL for a while, but he hates it.  At No Way Out JBL has challenged HBK to a match, if Shawn wins he get s set free and gets loads of money, if he loses he works for JBL for life      For More Info Go To:wwe.com|`|p2BJSCIWaa	It all started at No Mercy 08 HBK vs Chris Jericho(c) for tha World HeavyWeightChampionship... Jericho won!!! so in No Mercy JBL vs Batista No.1 Contender Match Batista won!!! so the 2 losers JBL & HBK whore fighting so who can go for tha championship next..     Then At Cyber Sunday Batista vs Jericho for tha championship Batista won!!! With Special Referee HBK was on tha Pool but lost to Stone Cold, Randy Orton was there too he just returned from a injury.. JBL was jealous of HBK 4 being in tha pool... then not to long on tha next RAW Batista lost tha title against Jericho...    so then in Survivor Series.. was team HBK vs Team JBL... HBK won!! that made JBL more jealous so.. later in Armageddon HBK did and announcement that he went broke so then JBL went and told him that he can help him.. but with a condition get tha Title so HBK had no choise and Agreed so leading to Royal Rumble 09 HBK helped JBL get to tha N.1 Contenders Spot.. First helping beating Rey Mysterio so he can qualify to tha next round a Fatal 4 Way Match with Jericho Randy Orton and HBK himself... by the way Jericho Lost tha title to John Cena that returned at Survivor Series and then lost tha rematch at Armageddon, And Randy Orton win to Batista at Survivor Series in a Traditional Survivor Match.. then that lead to Armageddon Batista won over Randy Orton then that lead to a feud and Randy injured Batista.. So he could be out of hes way for tha championship... Orton won to Batista so he could be at tha Fatal 4 Way Jericho won to CM Punk and HBK to Kane.. so in tha Fatal 4 Way HBK helped JBL by eliminating Orton and Jericho and later himself.. so JBL when to face off John Cena at The Rumble.. if JBL won HBK would had a spot at the Rumble Match but HBK stunned JBL with a Sweet Chin Music.. so Cena could win that lead JBL vs HBK at No Way Out so if HBK wins he would be released from JBL if not he would work 4 him forever..

ETarSy9Maa	The final will be between the Blues and the Sharks, if the final is played in SA, which I'm picking it will be, the Sharks will win.

For the tournament, I'd rate the Crusaders and Waratahs, with Hurricanes and Stormers bubbling under.

Z8UV6S3baa	So, as others have posted, the new Sigma is a perfectly servicable weapon. I even know people who like shooting theirs. I've shot both and own neither. The M&P had some issues as well when it first came out which have now been well resolved.    For all practical purposes the real question is simply does the M&P fit and shoot $200 better for you than the Sigma. In the shops I've seen that's about the price difference. If you are just looking for a cheap carry piece I'd be inclined to go with the Sigma. If you are looking for something where aftermarket features (different recoil springs, tactical lights, different sights, etc.) make a difference then go with the M&P.    Thinkingblade|`|K5AeQuSNaa	The M&P is the far better gun.  It is a better design, and fits most people better.  Especially with the interchangable grips.  I have one of the compact models, and I like it a lot.  They are reliable and effective.    The sigma has a bad reputation because the early models were junk.  The newer ones are just fine for your basic handgun.  People that have them usually like them.  The ergonomics aren't the greatest.  But if you can find one on sale for under $350, they are not a bad deal.  Not my first choice, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at one if the price was right.|`|AA12274507	M&P|`|AA11295048	M&P; the Sigma has a poor reputation.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The MP. The older Sigmas were crap but S&W fixed that issue. I had oner and it never jammed. I ended up selling it anyway. I would say the MP is better than a Glock 22. Like I have said before I am the only regular answerer here that does not care for Glock.

c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	Hello,    When I am running on the treadmill in the gym, most other runners tend to run around the 6.5mph speed. When you consider that it is easier to run on a treadmill than on the road your speed is a bit better than the average. Oh, this is for all ages as well.    When you are younger you tend to excel better at sprinting and as you get older you get better at stamina and longer distances so again, being 19 and a bit faster than average is good.    So from that I would say that your speed is OK.      Now there is another question to answer - your turn now - how do you feel when you run at that speed for 4 miles? If you were to rate your running from 1 to 10 where 10 is flat out and you can't do any more, 1 is dead easy, where would you be on a 1 to 10 scale? You should be running at about 7 or 8 for long distances. So if as you go you are thinking you are running at a 5, then your speed isn't so good - you can go faster! If it is a 10 all the way then perhaps you are going too hard and fast.        One last thing, you will improve your speed over the distance - as a beginner you will be a bit slow and not quite the same stamina as someone who has run a couple of years so keep working at it and I'm sure your speed will improve|`|eDCyle05aa	That is a good pace for a beginner, but once you get in really good shape you should be able to run at an average speed of 9- 10 mph, which is about 6:00 - 6:30 minutes per mile.|`|IITnJjAjaa	Tis good for a beginner, but you should be able to go faster. With more practice you will get faster quite rapidly, but don't suddenly start running a lot as you may get injuries. Gradually build up the amount you do.|`|OUXKbe1yaa	Your average speed is 6.65 mph.  You run 4 miles, at that pace, it will take you 36 mins to make the run (does it take you around 40 minutes for your daily jog?).   That's 9 mins per mile.  Were you to keep up that pace for 26 miles, 385 yards you'd probably place somewhere in the top half of a few Marathons.  The current world record in the mile is 3:43.13, set by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco on July 7, 1999. The mile is not run anymore, as far as I know.  Record time in marathon's 2:05:38 by Khalid Khannouchi of USA in Flora London GBR on 04/14/02.          Four miles is 6437.376 meters, or about 6.5 K.  Record times in the 6 km run are not recorded, but some runs that are close to 6 km for comparison would be the 5 km run in world record time of 13:00 by Sammy Kipketer of Kenya at the Carlsbad 5000 in CA in 04/01/01; and the 8 km of 22:03 by Peter Githuka, Kenya, Crazy Eights TN in 07/20/96.  Finally a USA college woman, Rebeccha Ricksecker, placed 69th in a local collegiate competitive 6 km run with a final time of 21:50. Or for comparison, the world record in the 12 km run is 33:31 by Joseph Kimani, Kenya, at the Arts Fest River Run, IN in 05/10/97. Divide that by 2, and you'll own the ersatz world record 6 km run, in a time of 16 mins 45.5 seconds, however, shorter runs yield faster times than longer runs if they're averaged out.  I certainly hope that those numbers and stats I just blurted out don't overwhelm or confuse you, they really shouldn't, actually.         Another thing you shouldn't be overwhelmed with is the above times and trying to meet those.  As a self-proclaimed beginning runner, maybe, at your age, comparisons to high school track times would be fairer.           Now, you asked about your age and should you be faster at your age.  Hard to say, but what I have heard is that younger distance runners don't mature and excel at it until they're much older than age 19.  I could google that for you too, but I think I've saved you enough time on the track with the above information, and you can google ages and world record performances yourself; it too, will be good exercise for you, especially if you were to research high school record times as a basis for comparison, which will be a high reaching goal for any beginner to set.  One thing is running's fun, however bear in mind that it can cause a lot of problems with leg joints.  So, finding a lower impact cardio-vascular exercise would be advisable, unless you're wanting to compete in track.  Many world record holders have had knee and hip surgeries after their careers end.         Finally, a good rule of thumb to follow if you're just trying to stay fit, is to run maintaining 80% of your peak heart rate for a period of 45 minutes a day.  That will keep you in shape, but you won't set any world records with that training regimen.  Competitive training is a whole different cinder track.  Lotsa luck, and keep poundin' them spikes, or not as it pleases you, just either way, stay fit, stay healthy.|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	thats a good pace for a beginner and for a jog/run considering runners world class anything larger than 8mph is a sprint

iQvkT8Doaa	Rafa the fat waiter Benitez, is a clown. I feel sorry for Robbie, after all his talk about the dreams he had playing for Liverpool when he was a kid etc it brings tears to my eyes....really|`|p4H61jQDaa	it was not his buy, there is a power struggle at liverpool and the director of football bought him in spite of what benitez though about him. benitez will be in madrid next year anyway.|`|SIKuOevVaa	Cheer up, Robbie Keane.  Oh, what can it mean  to a... Tottenham loser  with a... $hit football team!    Rafa realized too late: You can take the loser out of Tottenham, but you can't take the Tottenham out of the loser!|`|Pfq2zRejaa	robbie had about two good games in like 6 months for us so he simply didn't fit in coz hes used to a small club.carragher is just a no nonsense quality defender so what he scored an own goal who hasn't lol|`|mK06dus9aa	Managers have big egos. If Keane was not Rafa's choice it would cloud how he viewed the player. It is not right, but Keane was a pawn in the Liverpool power struggle which Benitez seems to have won. A parallel situation was Shevchenko to whom the special one never gave a really fair crack of the whip to at Chelsea.|`|UUT4rj3zaa	the ting i h8 bowt Rafa Benitez iz dat he sellz any1 dat makes a mistake for example Riise!!!  its just sad.  they just bought Keane n he's selling them coz he didnt score a goal that he wanted!!!!!!!!|`|pD9sj0qAaa	Yeah i do, just think hahahha they could've probably beat us last night if Robbie was there, but i'm sure all the liverpool fans have thought that already.    Get Rafa out he is no good and just a complete idiot, i'd like to say stronger but not allowed on here haha.    Carragher is crap anyway the onlt thing he is good at is gobbing off to refs and moaning.  He moans more than my mother in law haha. ( and thats alot)|`|RSJbqioUaa	I think Rafa made a BIGGG mistake. Torres was limping last night, what the hell are they gonna do if he's injured?
4cJuKxJbaa	It really is going to be who will do better in spring traning. I belive Melky is the all around better player, however Gardner is exciting to watch. I see Gardners skills as more of a come off the bench guy, great speed, goood bunting, good defense but not great average or power to me screams bench player....a very fast one who could steal you some bases late. I think Melky will win out the job & Gardner will be the off the bench guy...    Ankiel seriuosly? They wouldnt trade him, he is to good for them to trade. I cant see any trades that really make a whole lot of sense for them. Remember the Yankees are planing on having Austin Jackson playing CF bye next year, so whomever they get to play center will only be a 1 year guy. Also the Yankees are going to loose Matsui, Nady, Damon next year...so they are going to need a LF which will most likely be Matt Holiday...& a RF which would only stand to arguee that it could be Melky if he can step it up! Jackson, Holiday, Melky would be a great outfield defense & offense wise in 2010 but that is getting a little ahead of things! :)    To the guy whom said the Yankees wont have enough money to sign Holiday next year. With loosing Nady, Matsui, Damon that is shredding $30m+ off the payroll. If they signed Holiday for $16-19m per year they would still be cutting payroll. The only other major free agents next year will be Lackey(If he dosent re-sign with the Angels, which he will) Bay (If he doesnt re-sign with the Sox, which he will) & Mauer ( If he dosent re-sign with the Twins, which is always a maybe) The A's wont be able to afford Holiday so he will go to the market next year. Holiday will be the big ticket guy in 2010 assuming he has a good year in Oakland!|`|nSSKixvCaa	Andrew Jones. Give him another 20 mils and gamble on to hit another 30 home runs. That will teach the Yanks how to use their money.|`|dvboT2RGaa	Wait a second did i blink and Johnny Damon left, if not then definitely him. Johnny can go triple decker on you or just get a base hit. I like melky to but i still think he needs more experience, so Damon is my pick for now but we will see.|`|S0A9lz17aa	I would say Melky to start just because you don't want to rush anyone and ruin their development. Not sure if they will get Holliday next year because they spent so much this year.|`|XxG9SqYoaa	I think they should pull a Melky/Johnny switch. Play them both for like two weeks a month. But in my opinion Johnny can play any outfield position fairly well so if you have to go full time give it to Melky.

He was never more than a good deliverer of a dead ball which was blown out of all proportion. After all it is the person who gets onto the end of the cross who has to do the hard bit, ie.score.  As for girls fancying him, well I suppose there will be those who will fancy anybody in the public eye, which by the way, are only those that the media choose to publicise for their own ends.

And yes .. these miscreants do not understand what they have cost their team. At the same, you can not get 100% well behaved crowd. Such incidences occur in Pakistan, India and West Indies as well.

mMFJrPbvaa	Lint in your pockets.  In emergencies you can cut the top of your sock off and use that to catch a spark...if its wool or **cringes**...cotton, or cut out the inside of one of your pockets.  Natural Stuff that can catch a spark include Cedar Bark, Grape Vine bark, Cattails (punks), abandoned bird nests, dried out dung from cattle or any other animals.      However, you shouldn't go out into the wild without the 10 essentials, which includes matches/lighter and a fire starter such as cottonballs covered with vasoline, char cloth, or some commercial product that you can buy.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	birch bark, shaven beech bark, feather sticks, petroleum jelly soaked cottonballs, and many more I can't think of.  but there are plenty of good videos on youtube that explain this subject quite well, just put survival fire starting:  http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...|`|BpChBQBQaa	There are lots of ways.    However, here are a couple of "natural" methods which work a treat!    First is the Cramp Ball Fungus, more often found on felled Ash trees.  See the video below for quite a good demonstration of it and how to use.  I've not had any problems dropping a spark on them just broken in half but I like this guys method.    The second involves Horse's Hoof Fungus found on dead Birch trees.  This method is more primitive but still very effective.  Below, again, is a video link on how to use it.  It also has a quick look at the cramp ball fungus too.      Try these out as you will be pleasantly surprised at the results.    Good luck and hope it helps|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Look for areas where there may have been a fire or burn, old camp fire pit where there may be some chunk of half burnt wood that was smothered with dirt...if the ground is dry, lots of times this chared wood might work to catch a spark. If it's summer time try cattail fuzz or crumpled up dryed deer ferns will sometime catch a spark!

You don't fly off of 15 foot ladders, tops of steel cages, fly off of towers, crash to the mat, crash to the floor 4 days a week for years and not feel it.    Matt's career will last longer than Jeff's because he is more of a mat-based wrestler and less of an aerial one.

Ad8m1dYXaa	Mickie James could easily pull off a steel cage match, the girl is one of the greatest female wrestlers in the world today, and of all time... This young woman even rivals some of the legendary females in Japan, and overall, she is thought of as a female legend in the Independent Circuits, due to her hardcore wrestling styles as Alexis Laree. Don't believe me? Search for some hardcore Alexis Laree matches on the Internet.    To the person who said Beth Phoenix "The Glamazon" is the only real female wrestler in the WWE, youre seriously an idiot, Mickie James and Natalya Neidhart are arguably better than Beth infact, and Melina isnt far off either...    Mickie James, Natalya Neidhart and Beth Phoenix have the abilities to put on matches that would go down as all-time female professional wrestling CLASSICS, these three women infact could actually all be successful in Japan (NATALYA has actually been successful in Japan already) or Mexico, if they were the way they were in their individual INDY days They would make their marks IN HISTORY, and while you wouldn't see Mickie James beating someone like Bull Nakano or Aja Kong, she would at least show the world her TRUE talent, instead of letting the WWE water her down as an athlete, and make her look weaker than she is...    Vince McMahon ruined female wrestling But don't be fooled, these girls are more capable than what you see in the WWE...|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The Divas do work hard in the ring, but the gimmick matches where blood typically flows is not a good thing...on many levels.|`|QMveJrziaa	WWE has none because how can a talentless "Diva" (Not saying all diva's are talentless) that can not wrestle a normal singles match possibly pull off a cage match? Lita and Victoria could have pulled off a good cage match, as they were wrestlers. But if Kelly Kelly and Maria stepped into a cage....it would be awful! Woman are still doing cage matches, as well as many other more violent matches if you look at the indy circuit. Even TNA has streetfights in there woman's division.    If you like woman's wrestling check out a wrestler named LuFisto. She is a great technical wrestler, and has done plenty of matches a Diva would not go near. She even actually won a King of the Deathmatch tournament. Which is a annual deathmatch (Glass, Barbed Wire, Flaming tables, thumbtacks, even the odd staplegun) wrestling tournament done by IWA:MS. She is the only woman to ever do so.|`|HvnFTNmCaa	I was there when that match happened, it was very short and it was based on the Matt Hardy,Lita, and Christian angle as both Hardy & Christian got involved. With the current WWE women's roster, there is only of couple of "Divas" who would be able to make a cage match look good.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	Because they might break a nail   i think couple off reason  for example this pg era stop all the violence like blood  swearing even make john cena changed his wrestling move  name and cause they are not suitable for steel cage that is the wrestlers job  and woman only match really they can do is submission match and lumberjack match and normal match rest like falls count everywhere is for the guys|`|mJvZhdAuaa	The thing is, the women today don't have the guts that the women had before.  Even for something like a hair vs hair match, Molly Holly did it, but do you think someone like Candice Michelle would be willing to shave her head?

Suck though|`|85aWKsptaa	they are afraid of them getting hurt|`|e4LtX216aa	You most likely won't see one again...well, at least in the WWE because of their new policy of making programs more PG friendly.

Don't know why they haven't had one since.|`|67d9963e687ff64ac5d02a2e50fa2b47aa	There are plenty of them in Japanese wrestling companies. The WWE Divas are afraid or breaking nails and messing up makeup to do a steel cage match. If that's not the case then I guess there would be more cage matches.|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Look at these women. Most of them are a bunch of strippers turned wrestlers. They have no wrestling talent at all. The only decent female wrestler is Beth Phoenix. Since she's not a beauty queen they made her a heel.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Look at their singles and tag team matches.    You really want to see those women in cage matches? Most of them can barely handle a cage match, and even Lita vs. Victoria wasn't that serious in comparison to women in cage matches in Japan.

qO7nbSQVaa	Your right it was boring and i am an Everton fan and i know it takes two to tango but it makes me laugh when you read in the papers Fat Raf going on about Evertons negative and defensive tactics when the facts are after the three games Everton have won more of the games and scored more goals ,so who really is the more boring and negative of the two teams ? and that is why Liverpool were never really serious title contenders and never will be while they have Coco the clown in the managers seat.|`|p8lB73rdaa	Did Liverpool play the match on their own ?   If it was a boring game why only blame Liverpool ?  Everton's first shot on goal came in the 68th minute and they were the home team !  You haven't got a bloody clue !  I suppose Wigan play like Brazil !!    You've just said in your edit " by both teams " pity you didn't say it in your original question .  Good Luck !!|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Yeah boring, really.    OQ: Lots but that Chelsea vs ManU FA Cup final of couple of years ago sticks in my head a lot as having that extra snoozing effect.|`|iQvkT8Doaa	Same excuses as every time, that K.I.N.G guy was a really  good example of the way Liverpool fans come up with their excuses, "OMG GERRARD WAS INJURED, WE DESERVED TO WIN.

OQ Generally  its been always boring to see Everton VS Liverpool.

Nor to those of us who like to see Liverpool fans squirm and cringe.    There was a game earlier this season in Sunderland where the Dirty Monkey Mackems played not to lose against Arsenal and got a lucky goal late, and the only thing that saved the Gunners from an ignominious defeat to a suck side was a Fabregas goal in the 89th minute.  Awful game by both teams, one that wasn't man enough to try, one that didn't take them seriously enough.|`|bNykcEVXaa	Oh dear.. and you chastise me for being BAD...lmfao    You've managed to upset Delboy... one of the more decent users...       dR bad  Kitty... this Ain't FUNNY!!.. ?lol

Change teams, you will only learn bad habits with a coach like that.|`|yWoBYJVEaa	It is excellent advice if you want to spend your entire playing career on the sidelines.  (No one will play with you in a pickup game, no other coach would ever let you on the field more than once, and all referees will eject you.

OfNTLq3Qaa	I'd like to see it. Austin hates Hogan in real life.    The match would be short as neither can go for very long because of health.

15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	Personally I wouldn't do it unless there was another decent D thrown in for you. Maybe send one of your lesser RW's the other way. Boumeester is finally starting to hit his stride. Where as Zherdev is still a good producer but has cooled down as of late.    Like I said you don't have a lot of defensive depth. So unless you are getting a d-man in return or there is someone you can pick up I wouldn't make the trade.|`|GUulmGm7aa	I would prefer Jay Bouwmeester over Nikolai Zherdev although they're both talented. I prefer to have my team practice a defensive style of game. Bouwmeester would be a huge piece for me.|`|Icze35Nqaa	Don't do it!!    I would keep Jo Bouw.

9hC7bbf7aa	Her shoulder injury at the Wimbledon 2008 kept her from competing at major events since, missing the UP Open and  the AO, and multiple tournaments, and she is still not well enough to play...So her ranking slided to   17.

poEJEuwNaa	I'm a one-hander. I learned to play when I was 12, which was quite a few years ago, and there really was only the one-handed backhand then. I've tried the two-hander, but can't seem to get the hang of it.    Clearly the two-handed backhand does give more power, but in some ways the one-hander is more versatile. Some of the two-handers have realized that and have added a one-handed slice backhand to their arsenals. Roddick for example. Even Nadal throws in a slice now and then. There are a lot of pros that have great one-handed backhands. Fed's is ok, but Blake has a good one, although he overhits it sometimes. I saw him absolutely smoke a return down the line in a match in the Australian Open. I swear it was as hard as a two-hander could have hit it. On the women's side Mauresmo's is absolutely the best.    You also see the two-handers try a one-handed backhand sometimes on a wide serve because they can't reach the serve with two hands.    One more good reason to use the one-handed backhand is if you like to come to net. It is easier to make the transition to volleying, which most likely you are going to do with one hand.    Ultimately though, it is a matter of preference more than anything else. More pros have two-handed backhands, probably for the power, but there are plenty of one-handers.|`|rKbJ51XIaa	Yeah,he`s a diffrent story,he plays tennis like he`s doing the most easiest thing in the world.But I hit my backhand with 2 hands.It s kind of a hard shot|`|jByScRfraa	I have a one handed slice and a two handed backhand when it's in the zone. (I actually know a player the hits a two handed slice).    I hit the two handed backhand cause you get a lot more power and control so you can guide the ball better crosscourt. Advantages to one handed backhands are that you can extend further and strike the ball faster. The one handed backhand is very rare and only a few top pros (Federer, Blake, and Sampras also used to do it) will go that route|`|BRTa5h7iaa	2 because it offers more power but I slice a lot because my 2 hander is great when the ball is in my strike zone but otherwise, a slice is my best bet.|`|utKtg5Tsaa	2|`|0dJU51fcaa	2 for the same reason as you|`|2m1hbw2iaa	I like to hit one-handed, it gives me more reach, like if I'm running across and can just barely make it to the ball.  Also I feel like it gives me a better reaction time.    I'd like to know if anybody out there switches between the two, because from my experiences talking to people it's either one or the other, but most players are unable to master both.|`|8e56e99cdf3904f078aeee841934a654aa	I like both hands because I feel like I play better when I use both. However, if I am caught off guard and use one hand to do a backhand, I don't mind. So I use both, but two hands is better.|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	I hit my backhand with only one hand.  I was actually taught to hit two-handed backhands instead of one, but I change instead because I have gripping problem with the two-handed backhand and I also found the two hand stroke to be quite awkward.|`|qykk5MvIaa	i hit my backhand with two-hands. why? because this the modern stroke today that people use in the tour. two hand takes less stress of your wrist and give more power and spin. that is why people keep on beating federer because he use one hand backhand.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	ONE HANDED HELL YEA!!!!!!
9ujT56Maaa	I agree with what's been said above that today's players generally have spent the most time in an education environment, while the early players probably spent the least.  However, it's difficult to gauge who has more education, since American schools have been in a gradual dumbing-down process since at least the 1970s and Canadian schools since at least the 1980s.  So just because modern players have spent more years in school, they haven't necessarily recieved a higher amount of education    As for the IQ test to use YA... I'd hate to exclude the people who legitimately wanted to learn more about things.   I think we should have a social adjustment test instead ("You must be at least this capable of communicating in a rational, calm manner to post").|`|UzhfaJH2aa	Today we have more and more kids coming up though NCAA and similar college systems. Kids going through the junior circuits are more likely to pursue educational activities when outside the rink as opposed to having to work because their parents have more disposable income to help them. If you follow it back in time, say 40 or 50 years, there were (almost) no players drafted from US colleges and most junior players had to work to support themselves when not on the ice. Keep in mind that intelligence and education does not necessarily go hand in hand.    Bonus: Are you suggesting I give up my favorite pass-time? OK, you should at least be able to tie your own shoes. Maybe understand the difference between their, there and they're, too.|`|76nTvO4iaa	The highest level - The group we have currently playing in the NHL.    The lowest level - The players who were on the original teams. Most of them quit early in high school to play professional hockey for not much money and few benefits.  They're why the Emergency Assistance Fund exists.    Anyone should be welcome on Yahoo Answers.  If their questions are too dumb, don's answer them.|`|brd6l4MAaa	I think every proceeding year we will see the average education level of NHLers on the rise. It seems like more and more draftees are choosing to finish their educations before joining the teams they've signed with.    Bonus: I don't know that I could give you a YA IQ requirement number but I think they should at least be able to operate the Spell Checker.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	^^Why the hell is Don answering the dumb questions??    It seems to me more and more kids are going to college at the present time.I know Mr Bobby Clarke never even went to High School.    If YA required everyone to Pass an IQ test(Can people fail it?LOL) this place would be very quiet..I do think they should give a hockey IQ test to people with "Badges",although I probably wouldn't have one after but I can take a bullet for the team..LOL|`|lYnkvRASaa	I think it varies, as US college hockey became an option more guys went to school than in the past.    Some guys like Joe Juneau is an aeronautical engineer.  Impressive as he went to MIT I think and didn't speak a word of english when he started.    If players today are more educated it is only because they have more opportunity to be, our population as a whole is more educated today.    I have more education than my father, that doesn't mean I am as smart as he is.  As to bobby Clarke, he was smart enough to make a career in Hockey after he was done playing.    Education is overrated    Edit: Cme I looked down at that their floor to check my shoelaces and guess what there untied again......  Oh I guess I ignored that part of the question for a reason.|`|UoUaO52taa	Probally this. More players play college hockey and almost all finish high school    For the bonus. No b/c it would be quiet like Joe said. As for the people w/badges being exempt w/all do respect badge's don't mean nothing. I've never had a badge. Lots of other good contributors never had a badge.|`|AA12172407	Hockey has long produced educated people. The system for many requires going to college, and many finish their degree work. I would bet NHLers have more diplomas than any other sport.    Remember Joe Juneau-RPI degree in engineering, Don Sweeney, Donato- Harvard guys, the list goes on and on.    YA! having an IQ test required would be  like all standardized tests, there will be flaws in the questions and often bias in the answers.|`|gkb0n6dQaa	HA! Bobby Clarke never went to high school.  doesn't shock me, i was watching him on TSN last night.   Players from Sweden have the highest education levels. Swedish schools are among the best in the world. They require you to learn numerous languages and they make math a prime subject.
lYnkvRASaa	I would not chose the Leafs, to much media attention, pressure and a dysfunctional ownership group.    The Lightning and the Islanders also seem to have dysfunctional or meddling ownership.    Melynyck in Ottawa meddles a bit also.  Are we seeing a trend here owners who get involved in Hockey operations end up with a poor on ice product.    Atlanta is a no because you would never be able to attract high end talent.    I chose Ottawa as the ownership is the best of the remainder after Atlanta.      I also think you choose Ottawa so that you can have the privilege of sending Chris neil to your new minor affiliate in Outer Mongolia.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	NYI- Wang is a GM-killer...smells of "I'm brilliant, just ask me".  Tampa- Len & Oren know just enough to be dangerous.  To everyone.  Toronto- MLSE...'nuff said.  Pass.  Lots of rings to kiss, and at the end of the day, you're working for retired teachers who just want the equivalent of the envelope every month.  Like working for the Mafia, but without the shiny suits and the really good Italian food.  Ottawa- A possibility.  Owner only occasionally places head into his own nether regions.  Lots of trade bait since I'm cleaning house.  Atlanta- We have a winner.  They've got a minor league lifer as a head coach.  They're pretty much bottomed out.  Decent prospects (I think Angelo Esposito has talent, but I'm probably off my rocker).  I'll use the Washington/Chicago model.  Ownership doesn't completely reek of dysfunction, self-delusion, or old people with flop sweat who smell like feet.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	As a GM, i'd obviously go for my Leafs because I get to tell those stupid Ontario teachers (another strike for nothing?!) and that tool, Richard Peddie, to piss off and stop meddling in hockey affairs. The Islanders need the most help though, but that starts right at the owner level...|`|VjAoRpIhaa	the lightning    i am surprised how bad they would be. i knew they wouldn't be the best, but i thought they would get into or close to the play offs.  they could also do what washington and pittsburgh did, which is do bad and draft good people.|`|GUulmGm7aa	I would probably be of most help to Toronto because my heart for playing hockey lies with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Regardless of their downfall recently, Leafs fans know the rebuilding process will take quite a few years. I would want to be a part of it. I would really love to play along side Luke Schenn. Although I am smaller at 5'11'' 195 lbs, we play a very similar style of defensemanship. I'm a defenseman at heart.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Ottawa (I'm a homer I know)...but with the top line signed for the future, I can see adding young talent to once again turn them into a contender. Heater, Spazza and Alfie need to have the push from younger guys and also need to have that secondary scoring so that other teams can't just concentrate on them. The defence is a year or two from molding into something better. With the likes of Brian Lee ,Kuba, Philips to bring along younger D-men that I will find. Elliot will turn out to be a  1 goalie that any team would be happy to have.       ***Homes...You'd pick Ottawa just so you could have the pleasure of sending your boyfriend Neil packing.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	Before I'm accused of being a homer for picking the Leafs I'll explain why as GM/President I'd reject each of the others.  Ottawa - the owner Eugene "I'm not going to blow it up" Melnyk says that he doesn' t interfere but his finger prints are all over the franchise. A solitary owner is good for a franchise that is winning (see Detroit) but death fior one that is losing. It's hard enough dealing with players without brain dead owners interfering.  New York Islanders - Chuckie Wang is almost as bad as Melnyk. But at least he doesn't pretend to know about hockey. He is a business man and counts profit and loss as a measure of success. The Islanders are a bad team in a bad location with a bad arena. You can't work wonders with that kind of tools.  Tampa Bay Lightning - Koules and Barrie what more can one say. Talk about meddling owners. Just because someone played hockey doesn't mean they know how to run a hockey team. Better stick to twisted pictures.  Atlanta Thrashers - Probably the best ownership group in the mix but - It's still Atlanta. Better spot for golf and stock car races.   Toronro - The media has blasted the ownership enough to know (now) to keep out of the way. However the in fighting within the ownership group could mean that Tie Domi isn't too far away. Keeping the owners away could mean that the only problem is staying under the cap. There is room to build and spend. There are no long range high end contracts to interfere with the plan. With only three players on the contract after 2011 and a license to print money there is no limit to what can be done within the next three years. A lottery pick this year, a top ten pick next year and careful shopping of the assets could build a good basis for 2010 when the first wave of young UFA's hit the market. Careful shopping and wise drafting will reap benefits. Two rounds of playoffs will keep the owners happy and the success will be worth it.|`|qAlrpec0aa	Well, one of the hockey blogger guys on the Killer Jerseys site was talking about the fact that the GM's in the NHL are getting rid of coaches too early in the season, and that some of the GM's should be canned. They did say though that the Leafs were better off with Cliff Fletcher at the helm instead of Burkie. I dunno...    As for Mr. Bowman, he'd be best suited to take on the Sens, he'd really turn that around... but the Sens need a GM change too... Murray needs to go!|`|yHvh7tFlaa	I'll be a homer and choose the Isles, but I wouldn't last long because unlike Garth Snow, I have the nads to tell Uncle Charlie to butt out, open the checkbook, and stick to computers. Then I would hire hockey people, not bean counters.    You would have to go with TB, where else could you work on your tan? ;)    Bowman wouldn't go to any of those teams. He is a coach that takes teams that already have the pieces in place to the Finals. Would have been a great fit in San Jose.|`|m6lDXAmoaa	I would go with the Thrashers. They have a lot of young talent on that team with Enstrom and Lehtonen. Plus they have some veteran leadership in Kozlov, Schneider, and Kovalchuck.   I would try to see if I could hire Hakan Andersson from the Wings. Having him as a scouting director would vastly improve potential for draft picks that actually pay out. If not him, then a few of the scouts he has in Sweden or Finland. I would also try to get Sergei Federov in a trade with Washington for Schneider. Both are on the downslope of their careers but Federov and Kozlov together could add a boost to team chemistry. After some of the veterans retire, then hopefully, the younger players will have matured enough to make a positive impact on the rest of the team.   Yea, they are probably the worst team out of those five but that's who I would take.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	I'm not taking the Isles because it seems the owners don't want to win.  I'm not taking the Thrashers because even if we did well nobody would come to the games.  I'm not taking the Senators because it seems that franchise is snake bitten.  I'm not taking the Ning because of the same reasons I'm not taking the Thrashers.    So that leaves the Leafs(pun?)-I understand the scrutiny that comes with the Toronto media but the fans are as passionate as any city in the NHL and if we did win a Cup with me as the GM I would be considered a Hockey God in Canada.    I say you chose the Sens.Cause I know how much you love the city of Ottawa:)
AA11913857	gymnastics is a great sport to help you reach the goals you clearly want to reach. but if you would like to lose a little weight before you start, you can do simple things. eat better (more healthier), go walking or jogging every day, even go to a gym and work out a little. As far as the flexibility goes, that comes from stretching, so do some stretching exercises daily. good luck!|`|mEyrKLAOaa	thats what gymnastics is for.... lol|`|eytlIKITaa	That doesn't matter!

1ieKW07Naa	Federer ruined it with his crying. I know Federer didn't mean to, but it happened.    Nadal was happy inside. But he has now won 3 of the last 5 opens. Maybe Nadal thinks of it as "expected" now, and the mental high, jumping up and down stuff has worn off. "Just another day at the office" is a good way to put it.|`|pddwVjALaa	It was because of Roger's sadness.  You could see how bad he felt.  Even though he shouldn't have.     I LOVE NADAL|`|2M11CfPHaa	I think he was excited, but he saw how devestating the loss was to Federer.  Also, before winning Wimbledon, he talked about how it was his dream, so he was understandably more excited about that than the Aussie open.  And, yes it's true, the Aussie open is still the least prestigious of the opens.|`|AA12034105	He looked really happy at first but Fed being sooo emotional made him feel bad about celebrating :-|  All the attention was on Roger when it should have been on Rafa, the true Champion :)  Grand Slam winner on all surfaces !!! :D|`|1w5blbobaa	I think FEDERER'S EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION JUST OVERSHADOWED NADAL'S 1st AO.  & being a modest and sympathetic sportsman Nadal was more feeling 4 Federer that's why He said "SORRY" & "I can understand how are u feeling right now" & things like that.& so Federer's hurtfull loss overshadowed Nadal's gr8 achievement.  Bt I thing Nadal was equally excited & happy with his 1st AO title,may be Wimbledon winning expression was more exciting becoz it was unexpected 4 him.|`|0UUwv8Suaa	i think he didnt want to show 2 much joy, due to Fed's reaction..i believe this championship matters as much as the others.|`|ntycaIeVaa	I agree with everyone above me. Also, if you visit Nadal's blog he explains that his Australian Open victory was quite a peaceful one compared to his Roland Garros and Wimbledon victories because he put a lot of hard work into improving his game on other court surfaces outside clay and it paid off.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Rafa was ecstatic inside, but seeing his friend cry like that in the trophy ceremony prevented him from celebrating...|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Probably was slightly over shadowed by Federer, but with Nadal being the guy he is i don't think he was to concerned. I agree ^^ i think now being No1 its expected of him, so he goes out and does his job and just takes it as it comes. Than has a kick *** after party aftewards|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I think he found it hard to feel that celebratory considering Federer's reaction.  I'm sure he was delighted and I'm sure that we will see interviews in the future where he speaks about it.|`|gCGbbIMcaa	I agree with what everyone else has said.   Roger Federer`s crying definitely ruined the mood :(   Nadal was delighted with his first hard court grandslam but seeing the man he respects crying like that killed the mood. Its ashame really because even though fed didnt mean to still the attention away from Nadal it really really did. !! Vamos Rafa !! Best tennis player in the world ;)

Isn't it funny that the Stealers, yes they stole that championship, can't win a superbowl without the help of Steroids or the refs????????|`|6KZgeq3Maa	I think he may be taking this approach to try and deflect some of the pressure that Pittsburgh will have as being the defending champs next year.... hopefully it works.    Thankfully, most of their o-line are either RFA's or UFA's, maybe they can clean house and keep a couple and rebuild the rest of the oline with draft picks or affordable vets.  In my opinion, hold onto Starks, if the price is right (which is nothing close to the franchise amount he got this year).  Let Colon, Kemeatu, and Marvel Smith walk and rebuild from there....|`|QGBSOpt7aa	I like the approach.  I think they are pretty set on Defense.  WIth Mendenhall returning, that should give them another weapon on offense.  should be a great season.  I'm looking forward to it.  I like Tomlin.  At first, I'll admit, I was salty that they passed on Wis and Grimm, thinking there may have been pressure from the Rooney rule, but it appears that it is all working out for them.|`|2payLxhxaa	And the question is?    I like Tomlin too, but isn't every team a new team every year?|`|85ab2af63fb56f9dc602cf0b2db9849eaa	Where is the question anyway?

If Joe Girardi wrote that book, then that would be a different story.  I think the Yankees should just drop the issue.  By continuing to talk about it, it causes too much of a stir around the club house.     ------------------------------------  King Felix: "the Yankees have done enough to ruin baseball. next on the to do list? get knocked out in the playoffs."    What have the Yankees done that "ruined" baseball?  I'm assuming you mean the money they spend on free agency?  They money that probably your team doesn't spend on players so you're jealous?  The money they earn and have every right to spend?  Did they ruin baseball by paying a luxury tax every year?  Did they ruin baseball by spending millions and not winning a world series since the year 2000?|`|v7TXEzYhaa	It doesn't matter now he already wrote the book.

I don't care if he hates players, but he should be grown up enough to keep it to himself.|`|nSSKixvCaa	Yankees does not need to do anything. They just need to concentrate on the season and try to win games. Especially after all those offseason signing.

OfNTLq3Qaa	It's a good idea, it would have to combine the Divas of all three rosters but it could work.    Your second idea is just too dang funny.

The way the Diva division is stacked (no pun intended) in the WWE  is that you have a champ, then you alternate challengers on a monthly basis. It's basically the same on the men's side too, but the men's roster is many times larger than the woman's roster so it's not that noticeable. If they a had a larger woman's roster then it might be a good idea to have it over a two or three week span on Raw. But as it stands right now it doesn't make any sense.|`|xkWLcv62aa	No, only Phoenix would win (logically) or someone else they want to put over making it stupid...    But an idea is an idea :)|`|A8oU68uBaa	I think it's great.|`|mysuLVovaa	queen of the ring sounds good but that bread casket match doesn't sound good|`|SEFc9mRXaa	Love the idea of more match possibilities for the Divas. The same ol singles and mixed tag/Tag matches just get old after a while. How about a Hardcore type of match? (I know that it probably won't happen, but it would make for a dandy feud settler!)
nQHkkR8Raa	Both in ring. Rock and Orton exchanged punches, and rock knocks over randy. He kicks him, then randy gets up and dropkicks him. When rock is on his Way back up, randy punts him to the head, then drags rock to his feet and RKOs him. Get's the pin.    Your winner, randy Orton.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	the rock he and randy orton trade Punch's orton trys for the rko counted by the rock in to a rock bottom but orton counter that in to a ddt then orton goes for a drop kick and puts on sleeper hold and  orton try punt kick rock reverse it to a rock bottom hits the people elbow one two 3 winner the rock|`|zzIj5bN5aa	the rock would layeth the smacketh down on randy orton's candy A S S  by reversing the rko into a spine buster and then the rock bottom|`|MTQ2dmWJaa	of course the rock will win in a 3 pin fall match as he is more stronger, powerful and he is having much more strength than randy.    the rock rocks.............|`|kjCz5PYeaa	Randy will win...He's just good @ illegal teamwork !    End Of The Match:    Orton goes for an RKO and The Rock reverses it and hits a spine Buster!!!!!!!

Your Winner....Randy Orton!|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Writing the match would take much more energy than I'm willing to spend on a single question, but like most of the other answerers, I will write the finish.    The Rock attempts a DDT on Randy Orton, but Orton counters into his neck/backbreaker.  As The Rock struggles to get to his feet, Orton delivers a vicious punt to The Rock's head.  Orton then lifts The Rock to his feet and attempts an RKO, but it's reversed into a spinebuster.  The Rock executes The People's Elbow, then goes for the cover.  As the referee's hand is coming down for the 3, Orton lifts a shoulder.  The Rock then attempts a Rock Bottom, but Orton counters into a modified RKO.  This time, it's The Rock who kicks out after a near-fall.  As both men entertain the thought that neither will beat the other by pinfall, the match becomes a true technical clinic, with submission holds being swapped back and forth.  The Rock locks in his version of the Sharpshooter, but Orton gets to the ropes.  After Orton connects with another RKO, he locks in his vicious armbar.  Every time The Rock thinks about tapping out, he hears the chants from the crowd, and he fights that much harder to escape.  Every time The Rock increases his intensity in trying to fight out of the hold, Orton applies more pressure to it.  Eventually, The Rock escapes the hold and tries to finish Orton with another Rock Bottom, but much like the last attempt, Orton tries to counter with an RKO... only to have that countered into another spinebuster.  The Rock (im)patiently waits for Orton to get back to his feet, and when Orton does, a Rock Bottom awaits him.  Your winner by pinfall after an epic match, The Rock.    Long finish, I know, but that's why I didn't have the energy for the entire match.|`|mysuLVovaa	Randy Orton becouse his faster stronger and maybe smarter.|`|LfWghJYeaa	That would be a awsome match! Rock goes for the Rock Bottom Randy reverses it into the RKO winner Randy Orton|`|7AV9pFCDaa	The Rock     Randy Orton goes for the RKO but then The Rock pushes him to the rope.After that he closelines him and does The People's Elbow.Then picks Orton up and does The Rock Bottom and does the 3-count.    It's a singal match|`|iMGSaC0qaa	Lol. You must own an e-fed and you are trying to get out of writing results...    That's actually not a bad strategy to do it on here. lol|`|vVVfhHT0aa	Both are 3rd Generation Superstars....and both have great skills. The Rock responds to the crowd, while Randy recives Booo's. I perdict that Randy would RKO The Rock early in the match to get it over with...1..2..The Rock kicks out....Randy starts the get more angry and punches Rock, but The Rock starts to fight back and he puts The Peoples Punch on Orton...he gets back up and Rock DDT's Randy, and the Rock Springs up and looks at the People....by the time he's done...Randy bulldogs Rock. And he singals his Legacy to come out...they come into the ring and start to pile up on The Peoples Champ. After about 2 min of a beating....Randy is in position to Punt The Rock....When he's about to...We hear our favorite car crash...."It's Mick Floey!" He comes out the help The Rock. He knocks out the Legacy and they meet Mr. Socko....While Rock gets back up and Rock Bottoms Randy....1...2...he kicks out...then Rock gets Randy up throws him to the ropes....he comes back and Randy gets the spine buster! He moves into postiton....he takes off his elbow pad....throws it to the people...crosses his arms...runs rope to rope...and then..."The Most Eletricfying move in sports entertaimnet...The Peoples Elbow!" 1...2.....3! The Rock wins!!! Mick joins Rock and poses for the people.    Kinda long but Electrifying!

ndxXPie9aa	The largest you can shoot. Probably 22 cal. They're pretty tough birds.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	My old .22 air rifle was great against crows, although it was a pretty beefy old pump model and I had to use those cone tipped pellets, otherwise they might just hurt them, the cone tipped pellets would go right through them.  I had one of those smaller .177 pellet guns that wasn't as powerful and the decreased mass of the pellet made it pretty useless against anything bigger than a sparrow or grackle.|`|QC2NozBkaa	I agree with the above that the heavier .22 cal would be best, but I've kill a few with a .177 as well.  Velocity is the more important aspect.|`|AA12274507	.22 delivers more shock and destruction which greatly improves the chances of killing it.|`|2TB8p5fvaa	.22|`|12eIbLh0aa	I took out many crows with my AirForce Condor Air Rifle .22". The power and accuracy is by far one of the best for the value.  It's not too noisy either so it makes it great to shoot in the yard.|`|iYfm7U5uaa	22.
AA12274507	Superdomes will be more likely to cause the most damage. The superpoints will more than likely just drill a hole in him.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Actually depends mostly on your chosen air rifle and type of shot. The ballistic coefficient of the Superdome pellet is better than the Super H point by a reasonable margin, so if you are going to mainly be taking longer distance shots you will want to maximize delivered energy which will put you into the range of the Superdome.    For a crow, a hollowpoint pellet like the Super H Point is going to require that you have a magnum class air rifle as well as being carrying high single digits to low double digit energy to the target. From what I have read (I haven't personally done expansion testing of pellets in ballistic gel - but I should! It sounds like fun!) you need a least a couple of foot pounds of energy to get the pellet to expand. On a crow, because of the thick feathering, you need to be running at least 5 foot pounds on a good hit on target to get penetration past the feathers. That puts you to 7 as your minimum. Plus, to actually create a real wound channel with the expanded pellet you need to run another foot pound or so to drive the expanded pellet into the bird, puts you to 8. So, if you are running a 15+ foot pound gun at 30 yards and in, that approximately defines a reasonable hunting envelope for crows with a hollowpoint. Now if you are running a super magnum (22+ foot pounds, like a Webley Patriot, Tomahawk, Theoben Eliminator/Crow Magnum, Air Arms TX200 is probably at the low end, or any of the higher powered PCP guns) then your range can increase considerably.    Now, these are for body shots. Head shot it doesn't matter. 5 foot pounds with a BB will put them down, domed, hollowpoint, this is just about making the shot.    Thinkingblade|`|4mb6xaxBaa	feathers can deflect pellets and i would go with the domes|`|QC2NozBkaa	I tested both these pellets on dry phonebooks and the superdome out penetrated the superpoint.  The pointed pellets tended to tip and stop after penetration while the domed pellets carried on and out penatrated the others.  Can't tell you if this has anything to do with crows or not.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	i have found pointed pellets to be more effective as they tend to penetrate feathers rather than piling them up in front thus allowing a better chance to reach vitals  i have used domed pellets on pigeons and many times they didnt give clean kills  crows are pretty tough and seemed to go down fast with pointed pellets better.  just from my own experience|`|J7EgWHB5aa	superdome is i think the best pellet rws makes they are very accurate|`|4Nx9ZVDyaa	Superdomes will have more shock, they will work great for squirrel and rabbit and things of that size.  The super h point will work fine also just as long as you hit the vitals of the animal... Such as a headshot or a heart shot... but id say use the Superdomes.
eDCyle05aa	I have to go with Reggie Wayne because he puts up better numbers and you don't know how good he would be if Peyton Manning wasn't there.    EDIT: How do i not make any sense, someone said he wouldn't be any good if Peyton wasn't there. Kaine, your a dumb@$$.    Edit: Career Stats:  Reggie Wayne:  576 rec.  8,129 yards  53 TDs  Steve Smith:   509 rec. 7,348 yards   43 TDs    Note: Reggie Wayne has been the  2 receiver for the colts up until 2 years ago and still has better numbers. And they started playing the same year.    So obviously Reggie Wayne is a better receiver when it comes to career stats.|`|7V79OMMHaa	runner15 doesn't make sense.     Anyway, I say Steve Smith is better. Wayne is what every team wants their first round pick receiver to be, but Smith is one of the top three receivers in the league while Wayne is Top Ten.      Stay Cool|`|Roes9U61aa	Smith, he is a play maker not only at receiver but also at kick returner and punt returner.|`|xO2fDqklaa	Steve Smith. He is more of a playmaker with the ball. He has the speed and skills to break free of anyone. He has Delhomme passing to him, which isnt a hall of fame QB at all. He is good, but not great.   Wayne is great with Peyton Manning, if Manning wasnt there he would not be as good as he is right now. I'd take Smith in a heartbeat.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Steve Smith... not even close... Smith puts up better stats than Wayne and he doesn't have Peyton Manning throwing him the ball. Delhomme is more comparable to Sorgi...     I think even Colts fans would take Smith over Wayne were that an option.|`|7LUeUkLxaa	although i'm a colts fan, i'll have to go with steve smith|`|603wBW5zaa	SMITTY!!!!!!!!!!!!    He is amazing!    He can jump, catch, break tackles, run, and he's only 5'9''. There is not a single time you hear an announcer say, "that was not a catchable ball for smith." He can be covered by 3 people and still get open, and will 100% burn any single coverage. Wayne is a good WR, but needs single coverage, which happens too much for him, to break free. Smith frequently, if not always, draws double-triple teams, which allow other WRs to get open. Now if only Jake would be more consistent...|`|WChr31Otaa	Steve Smith without a doubt.|`|d76cd84a9e6b8f094c2eda6057fa9431aa	Gotta be Steve Smith|`|tVEm2eJXaa	Reggie Wayne 2008 stats: 82 receptions, 1,145 receiving yards, 6 receiving touchdowns, in 16 games    Steve Smith 2008 stats: 78 receptions, 1,421 receiving yards, 6 receiving touchdowns, in 14 games    So obviously Steve Smith is a better wide receiver than Reggie Wayne based on their 2008 stats.

GswnLKtQaa	Yes 45 wins but 50+ its going to be tough. the problem for the heat is consistency...heat will win 2 then lose then win again. Haslem, Chalmers and Beasley are doing great...    D-wade in my opinion should be mvp, he lift the heat from worse to 6th seed. could be defensive player of the year no disrespect to dwight howard.    1st scoring, 1st in Fg% among guards, 3rd in steals, 9th rebounds, 1st in block amongs gaurds.    too bad, d-wade miss the game trying 3...againts detriot but we will bounce back!    EDIT: hey Jermaine Oneal had 22 points 9 rebs and 9 blocks! againts the lakers    I say trade Marion for JO!|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Probably.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	NO    i guess they will win just 44 games,but that's close man!|`|JKIWCgbUaa	hell no. the heat are gettin worse every day|`|WLXFAeSnaa	It's possible. At the moment, it doesn't look like it though|`|i0QzvbSnaa	It will be really close, but I see them winning between 43 and 46 games. I will say that they just make it.
Y4mz8BShaa	There isn't. The JG BAR 10 is the cheapest worth buying.    http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...|`|AA10056762	As said before...the JG Bar is probably your best choice. As not said before was the fact that your rifle is not done here. IF you are playing with AEG's a stock sniper rifle will not shoot much farther than them. And nearly as accurate as an AEG. This is not at all sufficient for an airsoft sniper. If you are playing with AEG's you will absolutely HAVE to upgrade. There is no other way to compete with AEG's with a sniper rifle.  Of course if you are merely plinking in the backyard then go ahead shoot away.    PARTS: http://airsoftatlanta.com/parts_vsr10.ht...|`|AA12377112	You're going to have a hard time finding any quality sniper for that amount of money. I would personally suggest saving up another $150 or so and go to a local store and talk to the people that work there. The other thing you want to consider is do you want AEG, gas or spring?|`|cL7btvi9aa	Theres no high  quality sniper with a scope for $100 that i found|`|0XmwXtm5aa	For under $100 here is your best option.     http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...    Great gun, Marui compatible parts, so you can buy replacement parts.   And you can do some custom mods to make it shoot 450 fps. Just type it in on Youtube. Buy this one for sure, good luck!
2wrenQfuaa	Unfortunately yes..the NBA has been creaming it's pants for 6 years now, just waiting for this day.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	if they were to choose right now, it should be lebron.  no one man impacts the team as much as lebron.  well actually cp3 probably impacts more, but his team doesnt have the record to show that even with him on the court, theyre one of the top teams in the league.|`|FUoKu13Daa	Historically the MVP goes with how well the team does,    I think LBJ with his stats could have won it last year but his team record was not one of the best in the NBA.  I think they were 4th in the east.    Anyway if you take the MVP candidates out of their team, let say with injuries, who team would suffer more,  we can argue who would suffer more but I think the team that would suffer the least is the lakers if they had bynum,    I do not think CP3 is in the running so far, I think as of today the running is Wade, Howard, Kobe and LBJ, and if you put stats and team record I think LBJ is MVP so far but it might change as the second half approaches,|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Between Him And Kobe|`|WLXFAeSnaa	This is definitely LeBron's year!|`|Fh0shlVLaa	I say it's Wade's year. But yeah, the NBA's been waiting to yank their thing for LeBron for a long time already... and since his team's doing so well right now.|`|3QuZeCB4aa	Most definitely!|`|lWNc9NRfaa	Yes, he will win the MVP and I would be happy for him. The dude is a great player who has the best combination of size and strength that I have ever seen in the NBA.  I would love to see CP3 get his quad double, I went to their game here against the Mavs and thought that it might happen. Hope that him and Nelson can get back healthy quickly. (I think that Jameer is really under-rated for some reason)|`|4DcvpQXfaa	YES!    lebron for MVP!|`|VLiNYBTcaa	i hope so|`|JKIWCgbUaa	Lebron = greatest basketball player in the world|`|nZwT15Xraa	Yes lebron will win the MVP award. Why?, because  lebons PPG is 28.5, His RPG is 7.5, His APG is 7.0, His  SPG is 1.9, and his F.G% is .491 when kobe bryants PPG is 27.5, His RPG is 5.1, His APG is 5.5, His SPG is 1.3, and his F.G.%  is .361, so lebrons numbers are claerly are better than kobe's|`|rvl2f6ERaa	yep|`|NiZeMndlaa	i love the way LeBron plays but i think kobe might get it. they play difrent positions that is why some stats are difrent like rebounds small fowards are always closer to the ball when it comes of the glass. also kobe has a nack for doing the impossible but LeBron is not far of he dos'nt shot as well but he gets the ball in the hoop. this year will be a lot closer than last year|`|PWOW9nEmaa	heck yea!! i luv him hes my hero!! its the only reason that i play bball! but i think he should
uzNm9KtYaa	I'm sorry, but if you ask a vague question, you usually get vague answers, or none at all.  I have three metal detectors.  My son and I have more than a fair amount of experience prospecting and have found enough gold (and silver) to prove it.  We have prospected in Utah, Colorado, California, Oregon, British Columbia, Yukon Territories, and now in Alaska.  However, I have NO idea what your "cs2m" is.  Also, you are in the "north west".  Is that northwest USA?  Northwest Canada?  Northwest Alaska?  Where?  If you will be more specific, we will be able to offer you more specifics as well.  Thank you.

Do i think he is worthy of the number one overall draft choice? No way but Detroit needs a QB badly and he is the best one entering this year and they are basically forced to take him. Although the Lions could pull a Texans a few years ago when they by passed Bush and took DE Mario Willaims and that worked out. But in this case the could take OL Andre Smith over Stafford.|`|DyORD0Zkaa	its goin to be me|`|hSwdJeb9aa	Stafford or an offensive lineman|`|tVEm2eJXaa	The Detroit Lions will either draft QB Matthew Stafford or OT Andre Smith.|`|XOAsk1c4aa	Tackle - either Smith or Monroe     stafford is not the answer he will be another joey harrington!!!   build a team from the inside out...ask the steelers or giants

eDCyle05aa	To do well in high school you'll need to get your 100m time down to around 11.00, and your 400 time to around 49-50 seconds.|`|qGA7vXh2aa	Those are great times for 8th grade. Continue to train hard and you should be under 11 and 50 in no time. I would also recommend running the 200. You might be pretty better at that distance than the 100 or 400 because you have decent range.    And to the other poster, Samuels lost the national record to Jeff Demps during the Olympic Trials last July. 10.01.|`|OUXKbe1yaa	According to TrackandField.com, the American high school record in the 100 meters is held by J-Mee Samuels of Mt. Tabor High School in Winston Salem, NC at a time of 10.08 seconds run on 7/24/2005.     www.fasterrunning.com/oldsite/trackrec... says the high school boys' record is 44.69, set by Darrell Robinson of Washington, on July 24, 1982, in Indianapolis. This page has adult, junior and high school records on it. However, I didn't see a single record entry dated later than May 2001.    www.trackandfieldnew.com/records confirms a time of 44.69 for the 400 meter by Darrell Robinson of Wilson HS, Tacoma, Washington at Indianapolis pon 7/24/82.     That help you any?  Probably not.  You have some good times there for your age group.  Let's take a look at records for your age group, which would be 13 at the time you set your personal marks.     From http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/MS... we see national records for middle school track athletes as submitted by coaches in the USA as follows:  100m 8th Davonte Neal 11.24c, AZ Centennial  8th Jeremy Nicholson, 11.24c, IL Lincoln; 400m Fr Rahmel Dockery, 51.79a, WA Curtis.      If I were you I'd do a lot of mountain biking, stair running, and practice starts a LOT.  Learn to anticipate the gun, and develop explosive bursts out of the blocks.  That means a LOT of leg work, and a LOT of leg muscle development.  I used to ride a big old heavy schwinn, 3-speed bicycle everywhere, all the time.  Got me pretty speedy.  And I could anticipate and explode out of the starting blocks so low, I had to keep my feet moving in front of me to keep from falling on my face.  At one big relay meet I beat the world 200 record holder, along with everybody else in that event out of the blocks, but then my short stride caught up with me and I didn't even place.  But I could flat tear a 50 up!  I would not breathe for almost the entire 50, because breathing would throw me off my stride.  Man it was fun.    Stick with it and don't go getting all distracted with a lot of other baloney, it'll pay off for you in just a couple short years when you're getting the state champion's medal draped around your neck by the time you're a senior or junior in high school.|`|QXmM4BTJaa	if you're really running those times in 8th grade... you'll be alright.  Great 400 time!

bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	Look its your first round of the season, take out the driver and cut off the dog leg and shoot straight for the green.  What have you got to loose.  If you make it, your season is set, if you mess it up you have the built in excuse that it was your first shot off the tee all year.|`|GNNh52OMaa	i'd smack the sh*t out of it with my driver, instead of trying to lay it up where it breaks at 150.  since there are no trees, you can hit the driver near the green, which will give you about a 50, give or take, approach shot that would be easier than it would to lay it up at around -/+140 which would require a short iron.|`|GtR8WaI5aa	If you can hit your driver well, then use it with a slower pace instead of just ripping it.  If your not so good with the driver, than use a 3 wood and rip it.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	I'd advise a very conservative approach since you are out for the first time today.  Whatever you can put in the center of the turn. Factor in the Rust that has built up over the winter and just have fun....don't be concerned with Scoring.....Just try to reacquire your swing.   LOL  I am going also today|`|asX2hxFXaa	You need to base it on how far from the Tee to the dogleg itself.  Simply, you haven't provided enough information to make that decision.|`|84lw8pLoaa	I would use your 3 wood..a little more control than the Driver and you may be a little rusty being out for the 1st time.|`|IplmS6ACaa	The snow has been a diaster this year for us golfers.

(depending on how far left you have to hit it to get a good 2nd shot around the corner. then ease the ball on or around the green on your 2nd shot with the same 8 iron. you should get par if you hit those first two decent.|`|fFrdimDBaa	Go with the driver, "no guts no glory."|`|t3rmVomeaa	Well,  my lay up would be to about 125 yards, so I had a nice gap wedge into the green.  That would require a tee shot of 165 yards, which would be a knock down 7 or a smooth 8 iron for me.  I would play a high fade to take a little distance off and work the ball around the bunker.      Or, if I was feeling it, I would hit a huge high cut with the driver and try to land it on the green.      Im knocking the dust off on Saturday, its gonna be 70!|`|5KUHrJtjaa	if this is your first game, i assume you have had iether a lesson or you have some  experience,,,, on the first tee of a 290 yds dog leg you can use a 5/6 iron which should take you 150/160 yds to the fairway dogleg turn , that should leave you with 120/130 to the green , you can then use a 8/9 iron  the green , hope yu putting is good ..hope this helps...

BD7yd8D4aa	The players are in a shooting slump. That happens and I don't blame Brey for it. Better to happen now than at the end of the season. However they need to get their act together quickly if they want to make the big dance.    However, I have never been a big fan of Brey's offensive approach. It is too dependant on the three point shot. Fine if you get open looks but sometimes you will see three point attempts with two guys defending the shooter.    I don't understand why they don't try to work the ball to Harangody more and play a more disciplined approach. Trying to run with teams like Connecticut and Pitt doesn't make a lot of sense to me.    Defensively the zone has worked out OK. I don't think Brey would be fired this year but another dispointing season next year might close the book on him.|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	Yes, the players do need take responbility for the teams collapse. As for Brey, I doubt ND would even consider firing him because other than Digger Phelps when did ND ever have this many winning seasons. I know that a lot of people hate ND for their strong recruiting in football despite their constant failures. But the basketball team hardly ever gets big time recruits and actually exceeds expectations like TTU in football and Miami(fl) in basketball with recruits who were nobodies. But yeah you are right about the media overrating them this yr. But no need to hate their b-ball team just because of their football team, I mean nobody gives a damn about USC or Clemson b-ball other than Trojans and Tigers fans.
U7BkuEU9aa	I think he should hire a good psychologist to shu up the voice in his head that keeps saying "You can't beat Rafa! You can't beat Rafa!".|`|z28L84Cjaa	I agree with the person that said Federer knows more about the game than any coach he could possibly hire, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be a good idea to have someone in his box other than Mirka.  I would venture and analyst/advisor would be a better option for him. Federer has shown he can beat most players.  He has had a career that anyone else in tennis (except maybe Nadal) would give their right arm for.  He has also managed to do this without any injuries.  I would say his fitness and practice regimen is pretty sound.   However, I don't think he studies his opponents as well as he should.  His game plan typically does not change, which is why Rafa can beat him.  Rafa can run every ball down and rattle Federer just enough to make him more cautious vs more aggressive.  I would love to see Federer working with an analyst that picked apart every opponents game and then together come up with the best game plan.  As much as I love Rafa, I really think Federer could have beat him had he played more aggressively.  A few failed attempts at net does not mean it won't win the match.  A few shanked forehands on a second serve does not mean you won't have opportunities for a blistering forehand return.  He played it safe, played defensive, and tried to beat Nadal at his own game.  I think a good analyst could have told him how best to prepare for and play for Nadal.    Federer has often indicated in interviews that he doesn't watch the matches of his upcoming opponent.  I think this is a huge mistake because you don't have the most current information on that players strengths and weaknesses coming into the season.  For example, Nadal was having a very hard time with Verdasco's forehand returns becasue he was hitting hard up the line and taking the ball early.  This is one of Federer's specialties, and should have been his bread and butter for the match... instead he played it safe.|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	I have always wondered, does this man who has won 13 Grandslams and 58 singles titles ever need a coach? However, Roger can hire a coach who can teach him strategies in dealing with Rafa and Andy Murray. He has the play but he needs to change his style when playing these people and that is where a coach can come in handy for him. The confidence will come once he starts winning these smaller events and he will have to keep on believing that he can do it again and again. I am not sure if he can go back to winning three slams a year but I will be happy if he gets two more slams. Go Rogi!|`|gP7IB2XCaa	YES-if he had a coach, he could improve so much. also a sports phycologist.|`|KRf30XAHaa	well he keeps losing so he should i think because he needs a little hope now and then|`|PWOW9nEmaa	yea i think so cause no offense to him but he really sucks now!!! and he's lost almost evry game that hes played|`|1w5blbobaa	Well DEFINITELY.    I thought abt these long b4,I think he should hv hired a coach long b4,becoz it doesn't matter how big player ur or how much u can succeed yourself bt A TEACHER(or coach) is always needed 2 teach u more,& there is no end of learning.    I think players really don't get all the faults he did in a match as like his/her coach even if he watch the video replay.....That's the reason why all the coaches of every players represent 2 see the match & point out his/her faults & make sure he/she should not repeat that fault again.     So I don't know is it tooo late 4 Federer or not bt still if he thinks he can do more in tennis(becoz he still young enough 2 play tennis) he MUST hire a coach.IT'S HIGH TIME 4 FEDERER.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	Legends of the sport need a bit of time or thinking to be at the top of their sport,rather than a guider for him.I don't think he need a coach.But,i heard he already has a coach named as jos higyuras before 2 years.I am not sure about it.|`|0UUwv8Suaa	i believe he should hire a coach..lately he hasnt been as consisted as he once was.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Well...yes and no. After he parted with his prev. full time coach Tony Roche nearly 2 years ago,he only hired a short time coach or an adviser as he'd done at the French Open of 2008 with Higueros and at the AO this year. Mary Jo Fernandez was more or less an adviser at the AO.  It's difficult to hire a full time coach when Roger knows  more than Ex top players about the game...and he may have maxed out on his technical capability ? I'm not sure. He could see a sports psychologist from time to time along with some advisers, IMO. Tough situation he is in...although his game can be better. Who can he hire when everybody knows he's one of the best players in tennis history with 13 Slam trophies ?|`|8e56e99cdf3904f078aeee841934a654aa	hell no. Federer is still the King of tennis.

xOReEw6Waa	Yes it does sound crazy, so at least you recognize your insanity. Yes, it is in the wrong area.

It is an unanswerable question since neither side can be proven without a dinasaur to shoot.  Perhaps one day, someone will isolate some viable dinosaur DNA and make a dinosaur.  If that happens, you can save up your money and buy a dinosaur to shoot with the "sniper" rifle of your choice.  You can, thereby, prove which side is true.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	yes  but it doesn't depend on the rifle used, but rather the caliber and the bullet's penetration. Since dinosaurs are really big, something with 20+ inches penetration would be preferred. like a .3006 AP or .50 BMG AP round.   There must be sufficient penetration to destroy the brain, the animal will stop moving and die   Alternatively with exotic core bullets (like tungsten-carbine) a round would need to hit he heat or lungs to kill such a large animal. Steel core or harder bullets are needed since lead core bullets will fall apart before it hits and destroys the vitals.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Tell them to stop.    A 50 BMG round fired by an expert sniper into the brain of a dino would kill it, if the sniper could put it into the brain.  Don't forget that many dinos had heavy, thick bone plates guarding the brain, as an elephant has today.    Of course, some dinos were the size of small dogs, and a 22 rimfire would take them out, just as it would any small animal.  It depends on the animal and the gun.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Probably, if you could punch a slug into the brain, but I would choose to use my light saber. One clean cut would take off its head.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	I don't see why not. British soldiers used to take elephants with their .303 rifles, which were not even remotely powerful in big-game terms. It required some serious cojones on their part, but it could be done. Shot placement is far more important than the ballistics of the round. Of course, a minimum of penetrative power is needed for a given animal. Once you have that, if you can put a bullet in the brain or heart of that animal, it's game over.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, because you did not mention any specific caliber.* It would be possible.*|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Yes.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	That's because they're kids, and to them, the term "sniper rifle" has some magic meaning.  The US military issue rifles in several different chamberings to their snipers. The most common is 7.62x51, for all intents and purposes the same as 308 Winchester. 300 Winchester Magnum is also used, and the "big boy" of the group is the 50 BMG. Because of restrictions imposed by the Geneva conventions, the military use bullets that aren't very effective for killing game animals. A sniper with his standard 7.62 shooting at deer, for instance, would be undergunned compared to a civilian with his 308 because the latter uses a better bullet.  You also have to consider that some dinosaurs were truly massive creatures, and others were downright tiny.  There's no way to know, of course, but it's likely a 50 BMG would kill any animal that ever lived. The problem with it would be that the rifles in which it's chambered are unwieldy and would be a poor choice for hunting. Given a time machine and my choice of weapons, I'd take a classic English double rifle in one of the dangerous game calibers if I were planning to hunt T. rex.|`|LWzrCu5caa	I doubt it.   More likely it would piss him off and he would eat you.|`|JclKBf8aaa	Only if the caliber and the shot were sufficient to get the bullet into the brain -- remembering that the brain on many of these dinos was pretty small and often the skull was pretty thick in places.    If you're thinking of something the size of a T-Rex, the caliber had better be something like the Barrett .50 cal|`|UJmfDAI9aa	This sounds like a debate people get into while high. You can take one out with a head shot but you need something with penetrating power. A larger round would do more damage and take it down faster but a smaller round, properly placed, could take it down as well. Just need to penetrate the thick skull and leathery, scaly skin.|`|VSmQWuhEaa	The round would have to be fairly heavy and it would have to hit the minuscule dinosaur brain. I strongly believe the .50BMG sniper rifle has the umph to make that happen. The .338 Lapua might be able to do it but it would be a stretch.|`|cmvPENvoaa	It sure is possible, considering you didn't say what type of dinosaur would be shot.  Some were the size of chickens, while others weighed more than a herd of african elephants.  A .50 BMG is probably on the light side of caliber selection.  Dinosaurs have small brains and thick skulls. Worse is the fact that reptiles have primitive nervous systems, even a decapitated snake can still bite hours later.  So yes, a sniper rifle probably would kill it, but maybe not immediatly.  You should probably up your armament, a battery of 105mm howitzers sounds fine.|`|DHIudHy2aa	Define "Sniper Rifle" in a way that will actually tell me something and I will give you my honest guess.

7fe8aff17848d38692a4e9c1c436518aaa	Because Nature is Left-handed   "We run counterclockwise because everything in nature tends towards counterclockwise motion"    The Greeks ran counterclockwise, therefore we just followed their tradition".     because the heart is pointed slightly more towards the left than the right. Its for better blood circulation that they run ccw. So if someone was running cw, the heart would have to exert itself more to pump blood to the extremities since the persons tilted more towards the right than the left . That wouldn't be the case if the guy was running ccw. In a ccw direction, the efficiency of the heart pump rate is higher than in a cw direction-thats why atheletes run ccw.       The reason for the counter clockwise direction for race cars is on the left side of the car (in North America at leastt) driving counterclockwise provides a lot of physical advantages: drivers are shielded from the wall on banked turns, they have better visibility on the left side of the car where most people pass and the position of the driver is conducive to the effect of centrifical force.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	I believe it based on the seating, as a viewer it was more "normal" to watch people/cars run to the RIGHT from the starting point.    You can't always have seating in the middle of the track as to view this, and you would only see a small section of the track.|`|kT4I3C6caa	Coz majority of the human race are right side dominant and thus controling the turn comes more naturally with our dominant side out  side.  The dominant side always step up!
cCmKu25Laa	Hi! I have done heaps of gymnastics after school programs- hope this will help!  Definitely start with a warm up- do a good jog/skip/gallop to music. Pause the music and during the pause ask them to do a quick exercise- 10 tuck/star/stretch jumps, etc.  Stretch- Teach them to sit in a straddle position and stretch forward and do both sides, stretch in a pike position for hamstrings, shoulders, bridges, etc.  Start to work on basic tumbling- forward and backward rolls, straddle rolls, cartwheels, handstands.  Play a game- 1. Divide them into teams and allow them to make up 'performances' to music using skills they've learned. Perform for each other.  2. Create an obstacle course using any available equipment and skills learned- have them go through it several times, forward/backwards/crawling/etc.  Make it a team relay race. 3. Have a skill-oriented contest- time who can hang from a bar in a tuck shape, see who can stay in a handstand the longest, etc.  End with some conditioning or flexibility- Doing sit-ups with a partner, Trying to do the splits, etc.  Good luck!!|`|TZi4ChYYaa	hi    it really depends on their skill level.Most will have only done gymnastics in their P.E classes so i wouldn't try anything to adventurous. For warm up play stuck in the mud. If they get caught they have to do different jumps. A warm up if  essential too. Then on floor I would do forward rolls, backward rolls, then handstands with you supporting them. Possibly cartwheels. On vault i would do squat on. Practise jumping on a springboard and if the school has a trampette then practise jumps off there. You could do straight, tuck, star, straddle half turn. If they have bars then you could do chins and leg lifts, jump to front support ( tummy on the bar) circle down. Swings  and as the progress maybe circle up! I doubt they'd have beam but if they do you could do. Bunny hopping over a bench, forward and backward walking on the high/floor beams. Half turn on low beam progressing to high beam. Good luck|`|lTO5lZKQaa	well first warm up obviously by stretching and things, splits, bridges that sort of thing just get them to have a go and then try some forward and backwards rolls, cartwheels, handstands. maybe when they get better at their bridge/crab (whatever u want to call it, bride is the best word i think) try some bridge walking. if they get their handstand easily maybe try walking on hands?

8bTder08aa	There are colleges that have horse show teams.  The Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) is the governing body for the college team competitions.  This is their website:  http://www.ihsainc.com/    They have a page regarding scholarships:  http://www.ihsainc.com/default.aspx?mid=...    Additionally, individual colleges sometimes have scholarship opportunities for people applying for admission who wish to compete on the college's team.    Clemson University has one:  http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/horse...    Hollins University has one:  http://www.hollins.edu/athletics/riding/...    Southern Nazarene University has one:  http://www.snu.edu/SNUs-Horse-Show-Team-...    Maryville College has one:  http://www.maryvillecollege.edu/news/new...    Northwestern University has one:  http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/m...    Moravian College has one:  http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/20...    And there are many others.    To get a scholarship, it's just like any other sport-related scholarship:  you have to offer potential to advance the success of the team.  IOW, you have to be a show-ring winner.  Additionally, you have to meet the academic requirements for admission to the college.    I hope that helps.  I suggest you contact schools you are interested in directly to find out about the availability of scholarships.  Good luck!|`|0WASp0bHaa	There are Equine colleges.

Drink gatorade to avoid dehydration.   4. After your workouts, this may sound odd but have one beer (if you are of age). It is scientifically proven that the sugars, salts and bubbles in beer rehydrates the body faster than plain water. The quicker you rehydrate, the quicker your muscles retain memory, which helps with reflexes. Which is always good for athletes.

If your desire is to become a really great individual tennis player, then you need to travel down that path.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	theres no age limit so you can definitely compete in tournaments even as a senior citizen. most likely you will not be able to turn pro. think of the chances someone who starts learning basketball at 18 has at playing in the nba. but just because you will never be pro doesnt mean you cant enjoy it as a recreational sport. i think most states have lots of leagues and amateur sports tournaments--including tennis--with different level and age divisions should you feel the desire to compete. not sure of any national amateur tennis tournaments though|`|RC3WoqFkaa	yeah, u can complete in tournaments. national level isn't likely, but u can play regionals|`|0dJU51fcaa	Of course! more likely regional but why not??
YKAyWCkgaa	There are a lot of great sites out there, but the one I've been using is     www.thepittsburghfan.com    The are much cheaper than NFL.com and they are very reliable.  I've never had a problem with them.    Hope this helps.|`|AA11042842	If you live in Pittsburgh, there are lots of places.    You can go two blocks down from Highmark, through market square and see a variety of shops featuring Steeler Merchandise.    If you want to go to Station Square there are five steeler merchandise stores in the the mall and the prices are pretty reasonable too!    Go Steelers!|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Anywhere, they are cheap everywhere, cause who wants Steelers merchandise? haha just kidding|`|iW2jdfkJaa	Here you go. This site has some    http://sportsfan.gift-givr.com/?q=Steele...|`|wxXguyK3aa	Get a black and white striped shirt.|`|dWovTD6Saa	I would try online, steeldeal, ebay, or just sports websites like nfl.com or espn.com should have steelers stuff. If you live in Pittsburgh, you could try a vendor at the victory parade(If it's still going).    Being a Vikings fan, I don't know much about how much prices are after a super bowl victory though.|`|2payLxhxaa	ebay dude|`|QGBSOpt7aa	you can find good buys on Ebay.  During the SB XL run, I was able to score lots of good steelers items at reasonable prices.  Just make sure you check the seller's ratings so you dont get ripped off.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Unfortunately, to pay for legit SB gear...it wont be cheap for a couple of months..... You can try ebay, but most of that is knockoff type stuff. I feel that it is better to pay the few extra bucks to know it is real than to take the risk of buying counterfeit stuff for cheap.  On the Steelers site, you can buy things like Super Bowl shot glasses, mugs, and stuff for very affordable prices and it is guaranteed to be legit.|`|f29Uxocraa	Look in the garbage

zUJUwSXMaa	yes i think a lot of people would want him to stay at old trafford but unfortunately i think he will definitely make a move someday, i mean almost all soccer players do. but hopefully he'll play for man u in 10 years to come atleast, he's a great player !|`|KYf9yhvLaa	Yes. I  for one wants him to stay here at the theatre of dreams.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	As a Man Utd fan i would love him to stay with us, and i think he oews a lot to the club for making him the player he is.  But speaking objectively i think he wants to go 'home' to Real Madrid, yes i know he's portugese! but I'm sure he grew up dreaming of playing for Real and if the money is along the lines of kaka's move, then why not!|`|MjPd9vyYaa	No, he should go to Serie A. I'd like to see him there :)|`|0EmjQjf7aa	YES!!!!!!!!! he ant nothing with out man u|`|Raw0otInaa	No I think he should go to spain with more of the talented players in the world.|`|JMjtth41aa	Well i think when somebody try just for prosperity & haven't any beautiful aim in his/her heat after a while he/she won't be successful!  Maybe Chris needs a change in his way! He needs time & we give him that!   man utd without Chris??????|`|A8mKCXuUaa	Yes,he should...|`|5E5haKaaaa	YES....i think he should spend the rest of his career at MAN U..coz man u has given him the exposure and it has put him were he is today.And cristiano ronaldo without man u i guess his skill would be finished by small stupid clubs...

And if the injuries to Gerrard and Torres are long term, then who are going to be the goalscorers for Liverpool??|`|7Xridrxaaa	"That means Man Utd will win matches but they will concede more when loosing!" haha i lost count of how many cleansheets they have had in a row. Man United will win the title again! I agree with the possibility of Arsenal and Villa equaling in points though|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	No, theres no way Liverpool will win it.  if Chelsea don't then it will be Man U  secondly, arsenal won't be 4th, they'll be lucky to be 5th|`|CowJLy9Jaa	I hope so!!! Liverpool deserve to win something, its been far too long for them!    Oh and Celtic will win in Scotland :-)|`|0jviPilhaa	Erm........ No. Are you another ranting/deluded scouser !!|`|lWNc9NRfaa	I would go for that, but believe that the top 3 will have Chelsea 3rd. Liverpool has a great chance, but Man U seems to have a better schedule at this poirnt. Aston Villa will still be crying so hard that they could slip to 6th.|`|NctYwdvhaa	not those exact points, and probably not those positions either|`|PD3qATQtaa	Nope, for me United will by champions and Villa will finish at least 4th.|`|nwwhfuADaa	wait a minute........you've got everything wrong well half of it!!    1.Man.utd  2.Chelsea  3.Liverpool  4.Arsenal    thats more like it!|`|bxV80Clnaa	No Man Utd will win lol|`|ndqYQGYXaa	no.|`|iLCc3bplaa	U wish     This is how it will finish:    1.Man Utd-83 pts Gd- +58  2.Liverpool-78pts Gd- +38  3.Chelsea-77pts Gd- +42  4. Aston Villa 75pts Gd- +37  5.Arsenal 74pts Gd- +38  6.Everton 68 Pts Gd- +28    I'm not sure who 2 put in 4th It could go 2 Villa or 2 Arsenal|`|Y8n3hbN4aa	No    Man U  Chelsea  Liverpool  Arsenal  Aston Villa    and yh man u will definetlly score only 3 goals, genious.
RrEESD6Paa	I can definitely help. I would recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable sports ticket sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck! Check out the link below.|`|AA10715150	Dude, they're Islanders tickets.  They only cost over face when they're playing the Rangers.  Usually they cost less.  This is a good deal:    http://islanders.nhl.com/team/app?articl...    $175 for 2 tickets to three games after you subtract the gift card value.  And a hot dog and soda is included.  That Devil's game is one of the choices.  Also:    http://islanders.nhl.com/team/app/?servi...    4 tickets for $100 bucks.  Includes 4 free hats, and the same free hot dog and soda.    Or wait until game day, one of my co-workers used to get free tickets on game nights, because they're that desperate for warm bodies in seats.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	Ticket Master man|`|p4H61jQDaa	every ticket is cheap for the islanders so just go to the arena at game day and buy them there|`|BqVcz1R1aa	Just go there early enough to buy them.     Online would be much more expensive. (With fees, and shipping)    Go Islanders!!!   Can't stand the Devils|`|03f2de52db47002d47005b445fa0f85baa	The way our team is going this year, I have no doubt you can go to the stadium itself, buy the cheapest nose bleed seats and sneak your way down to the expensive ones.
ozVqauMXaa	They are good enough, provided the injury bug doesn't hit again.  On paper, as usual, they look fantastic.  The only quibbles I have with their team is that they are somewhat lacking in power on the right side, and I'd like to see an upgrade at 2nd and in the outfield.  Castillo is the biggest weak link though.  I have a feeling he'll be keeping the bench warm all year, and the Mets won't make a move, because his salary makes him virtually untradeable.  Other than that though...YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!!|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	If everyone plays to the best of their abilities for an entire year, then yes. But if Carlos has another lackluster first half, if Oliver alternates great and lousy starts, if Reyes disappears down the stretch, then it will be a struggle.|`|4SKmjYrsaa	not even close, they won't even get out of the east! atl and philly are gonna win division and wild card, sorry. I will say omar shoulda signed Manny, then ya'll would have a chance|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Fans were ready to throw Delgado under the bus in the first half.    Beltran is no longer a top 2 CF.      It's pointless to argue with a fan who predicts great things for his favourite team.    A ton of Yankee fans are predicting ring  27 this year as well.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	its a talented swuad good enough to make it to the playoffs if the y can shake it up and keep their composure...but they're not a championship team...|`|nSSKixvCaa	I think their rotation is about at no. 4.    I actually rate their pen at top3.    Reyes is not at top 2. The guy is inconsistent and big attitude. At least Rollins and Remirez are better than him. He has the best speed though. I would say he is the top 3 lead-off man in the league.    Yeah, Wright and A-rod are the best third baseman at moment.    Beltran is the best CF.    No need to mention someone out of top 5.    Mets corner field is not very good.    Rests of the team are pretty good.    I think if they go head to head with Phillies. Santana will neutralise Hamels and the rest of the rotation can beat Phillies.    I still cannot believe Rays and their rotation collapsed against the Phillies last year. I guess anything can happen in the post season.|`|6ad9d51cf0eb3915d774ed293ef5d282aa	i cant answer this    i thought they had enough in 2006...i was wrong  i thought they had it in 2007....i was wrong  i thought they had it in 2008....i was yet again.    2006 they were 1 hit away from the WS, 2007 they had a 7 games lead with 17 to go, and they had a 3 games lead with a week left in 2008 and they didnt win anything.    they also keeping the same offence that choked in the clutch and lacks the big RH bat, the same rotation with a hole in the 5th spot, fielding has holes at C,2nd, LF, RF, bench is a shell of what it was last year, i see the only improvement being K-Rod and Putz. but with all that aside, as a met fan, i want them to win it this year and every year that follows. we just have wait until the last day of the season again to see if we will be in the playoffs or not.|`|PUrP4Axqaa	Besides Santana the rest of the rotation has had problems such as Maine injured in 2008, Perez is way too inconsistent to judge how many wins he will win probably above 13 though, Pelfrey has shown signs of improvement but he is still not reliable guy. Redding and Garcia or Niese are going to be the 5th starter and they are going to need to prove they can be successful because Garcia is coming off an injury and Redding was with the Nats and Niese is still young.    I'd say the Phillies are better suited to win the division because they won it last year, the Braves have also made improvements and they always give the Mets problems so its not so easy to say the Mets will win the division or WS you just have to wait and see how it all goes.|`|V7dGe2kqaa	mets suck.|`|PTgJKcexaa	I think they will be a semi solid team this year and they will at least get the NL East but they have no chance to win it all.|`|VPDcy4Qwaa	No, their bench is weak and they are an NL team so thats important. Their bullpen after putz and k-rod is meh. They have holes in the corner OF spots and at 2B. They could use an upgrade at catcher. Omar will make some trades though so don't worry.
dCbIHBpGaa	Get them bulletproof vests for their own legs and make sure they are packing blanks in their shooters when they go to the club..|`|f7qVtYfaaa	there are some interesting free agents but i think they would look to the draft and maybe count on plax .|`|S5RBFnwjaa	draught in some players with REALLY BIG HANDS to catch the ball with|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	The Giants need a big reciever in order for their offense to work. A few big name to look for in Free Agency is obviously TJ Housh. However, there are a few guys that can help. Devery Henderson and Lance Moore are both unrestricted FA and both showed their potential with Brees especially Moore this year with Colston going down. Antonio Bryant is actually a FA and he definitely showed is a gamer near the end of the season. Bryant johnson and Reggie Williams are also out there but may not be what the Giants need or are looking for. They will groom hixon some more but unfortunately, Eli is a system qb that needs the big reciever to open up stuff to his other WR. We all saw what happened when he doesn't have that guy.|`|tNerdFYsaa	I think they'll try to go after Boldin...If not maybe try to go after the receiver out of North Carollina..forget his name, but they need a tall speedy receiver to replace Plax|`|8vCzgOlpaa	Get Plaxico back into camp and play without being a pain to the NFL|`|AA11042842	Hopefull they will do the best they can do and get new ones|`|jLOCqhckaa	Get better draft picks, build up Dominique Hixon over the off-season.|`|hSwdJeb9aa	Hopefully, draft somebody (percy harvin)-perhaps or hope they get burress back or trade or go into free agency and get a wide reciever (think they have a lot of cap space)|`|XlAW94gNaa	I dunno if its possible, but trade one of their running backs and there draft pick for a lower pick and get Michael Crabtree? lol
OfNTLq3Qaa	I can't speak for all fans but since I'm a big heel mark, Edge for sure.  I think a lot more would as well just because of the respect that fans have for Edge. Plus Ortiz is good but he's not at the same level as Edge.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	They would most likely cheer for the face.In this situation,it would be Ricki Ortiz.But it would also depend on location as well.If they were to have a match in Canada or the northern states around New York,Edge would most likely be cheered.Ricki Ortiz has only just started he isn't that well known right now so Edge might be the favourite.But with the wwe's current children viewers Edge would probably be booed.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well its hard to tell if they where in Toronto then most likely Edge would be cheer for being that Toronto is is hometown but other then that Ricky would be cheered the same thing happened this monday when RAW was in ST. Louis Randy Orton cheered being that they where in his hometown|`|DJd0DruQaa	ya|`|irw0AyUPaa	Well seeing that like 70% of the crowd are children who have only watched for 2 weeks, i would say ricky ortiz.    a true fan like my self would cheer edge, as he has more charisma, skill and technicality.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	People who like edge will cheer edge no matter who his opponent is. A lot of people will cheer Edge, because they know him and do not know Ricky Ortiz, because they do not watch ECW. WWE will dampen the cheers for Edge and the boos for Ricky Ortiz, but the leve crowd will know differently. The audience in the arena wil cheer Edge 70% to 30% for Ricky Ortiz, but television viewers won't be able to tell that.|`|AA11354286	The children would cheer the faces because that is what they have been taught. The women cheer who they think looks better. The men will cheer who they think is a better wrestler.|`|T2oViVtnaa	I always go for the better wrestler and here i would go for edge|`|zMps0L5daa	People Would Cheer For Ricky Ortiz.

bf6083ffadca74a66ca0bd4555eba2feaa	Remember that a soccer player is close to being an athlete. He is running for most of ninety minutes and moving in some way for the rest; carrying an extra kilo or two can take its toll and is likely to reduce his stamina and effect his sprint speed over the period of a game. At pro levels, the differences in skill levels between teams and individual players can be small, so every little thing has to be taken into account. Unlike the heavierweight American football player, who will run a short distance and pause for several minutes, the soccer player needs to be lean and agile; the very best are almost elegant, and you don't get that looking like you're first in the queue for free doughnuts.|`|gPsFFQbRaa	maybe 2 run faster|`|lhASsVwcaa	Winger for pace, Usually you have a striker thats heavier and one thats lighter, thats good for combination. If your too heavy you cant run. Its good if your a defender though.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	smalll hhhhhmmmmmm not all players..    http://www.torcidagranata.it/photogaller...|`|UUT4rj3zaa	this iz bcoz they'll get tired easily, they wnt b able 2 run very fast...etc...|`|L1QTSErIaa	Oh come on. Any manager would be concerned about a players weight. It's not about the extra kilogrammes. A player just needs to be fit and run an average of about 12 kilometers a game.   Even a beauty queen signs a contract stipulating not to gain extra weight during a 1 year period.|`|Maja0Gzdaa	Because they'll get tired more easliy than fit players...|`|AA11995384	Big guys have plenty of power but little stamina.  In football it's a case of a bit of both.|`|Y8n3hbN4aa	One- Depends on their position, if theyre a Defender then its better to be heavier but if youre a winger of forward then its good to be light.     Two- They need to be in fit shape, and able to run for long periods of time.    three- It depends where the extra Kg is, if its cause theyre tall then managers let them play, but if its cause they're 'fat' then they have some reason not to let them play.

LReOvHEdaa	I think footballers want to become popular in some way or the other..I guess this is one way...because the right way is quite hard to follow|`|cjNtjOZtaa	- I think people with low IQ 's should not be allowed near such huge amounts of money , I mean you never Hear the likes  of Alan Smith doing anything like that , or Micheal Owen , it's just the excuse my language here , the  really thick ones or the  thugs who cause problems , put him in jail , he doesn't deserve  his talent - he's been navie nough to let the money get to his head .|`|N7fNwIQSaa	Throw the book at him....im fed up of seeing fed up of seeing footballers thinking they can get away with stuff|`|El7C2JsMaa	Nothing has been proven yet and he hasn't even been charged so lets not jump the gun, but if he was involved then he should get dealt with appropriately!|`|aB4n96vhaa	these people are paid huge amounts of money and lets face it the majority are thicker than pig  s hit , they think they are above the law i dont know if he hes done this and i dont mean richards in particular just footballrs in general|`|gPsFFQbRaa	i duno|`|2JBy5Imcaa	Footballers are overrated, overpraised and over-payed!!

Q3hOqlOTaa	It wasnt a Liverpool player, noone cares. The Everton fans cheered injury but it was at Liverpool so who cares.    Y!A is anti-Liverpool, noone cares about Micah Richards poking a local. If it was Gerrard making a face at SAF then MURDER jailtime bla bla bla.    Even if people do care, it will never come close to the 90% of people who were absolutely vicious and unforgiving towards Gerrard.    rant over.    You do give a lot of banter to Liverpool, but you also do Arsenal and others at appropriate times so I'm not actually attacking you :P You are decent, others need a new hobby. If it was Rooney we would all go mental because we sat and took all the Gerrard abuse with the excuse  of "if it was a United player..." so why would we dissapoint. We paid the consequences without doing the crime so partay. As you can see the continuous digs effect people, cant wait for the opportunity to humble some of these people up a bit although that might be impossible.    lol yeah. I am surprised I have no thumbs down (yet)|`|pW9oJQm0aa	I don't know about it.It's better u  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with  http://freeinternettvstations.blogspot.c...|`|m2zXOREJaa	He's innocent untill proven guilty,whilst Stevie is guilty untill proven innocent,it was the same when Wayne went fossil fishing and what did you lot say about that.there's no cobwebs on him.lmao|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Why do these things happen MAINLY to Premiership players???

nJ5kceMBaa	Ghana hopefully. He'll probably have a hard time getting caps for England...and who the hell in their right mind would choose to play for Scotland? Ghana are like my second favourite international team so to speak, and they could do with a top class striker (if Welbeck makes it that far). Asamoah Gyan has been really poor the last couple of years, Amoah isn't good enough and Junior Agogo isn't exactly Eto'o or Drogba type standard either.|`|SiOjEH00aa	if he's (very) good, then England, if he's decent then Scotland and if he's crap then Ghana.    :)|`|7Xridrxaaa	One question... why can he play for Scotland??|`|JCRdicqXaa	A very promising youngster.  I hope he is good enough for England................and by God do we need it.|`|xLyNsywiaa	Not to nit- pick foody thing, but I noticed no one noticed you said who instead of which, lol :P    Anyway, he should pick England, so United continue their fair contribution to the England squad...|`|Y8n3hbN4aa	Ghana for first team football|`|64M2xWyAaa	born hear, lived here, lives here plays for english team,  he should very much think he is english    and i think he would be selling him self short if he chose anyone but england,|`|fLpnC8qtaa	I think England. He plays in England and is comfortable with the players, style and pace of the team. Though if not, someone above made a valid point re Scotland and first team football.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	I think Scotland because it means first team football but also they're a better bet than Ghana although Ghana have the likes of Michael Essien or Quincy Awusu-Obeye but realistically he's always going to choose England because we're the best! : )
dDhTMacAaa	Lost identity/    Terry Porter and GM Steve Kerr want the team to slow it down and use the "Big Fella" down low but Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire, and others really want to run the floor.    They need to find what they really want to do, because with that talent their current play is unacceptable.|`|LdIgg7yTaa	O Meal? wtf?    And yeah, I'm wondering the same thing. They're way better than the way they're playing- but if they continue like this, they're going to loose to GSW! And look- Matt Barnes misses a layup. What the hell is going on?|`|nwOziRYyaa	they r not a good combination....    shaq to the lakers....|`|lBhkWpDoaa	I read that the whole team is not adjusting to Terry Porters system    all bad for the Suns the rest of the year    O Meal: now i get it|`|9Injuk2zaa	O Meal ate himself.|`|jKOB7n35aa	They need to find their game.
DEcunDd5aa	Then maybe we should start to cheer him (while holding holding a bucket close by). LOL :D|`|p8lB73rdaa	He doesn't have a lot of choice really , does he ?  His own mother boos him !|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Ah that explains why he tries so hard then lol|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Ah , that would explain why he gave the Wigan crowd the middle finger , trouble is I don't think I could bring myself to cheer for him.|`|Maja0Gzdaa	He runs to the left, he runs to the right...Cristiano Ronaldo he feels you up tight...|`|NctYwdvhaa	well he wants attention. so i guess if you cheer him, he'll cry|`|2JBy5Imcaa	Yep. Lets start cheering him!    He'll probably start crying!!    I h8 Ronaldo!|`|gPsFFQbRaa	intresting|`|vwTu8fY7aa	No No   Christiano Ronaldo is the best player that is playing the game right   now If he is not scoring then he is making big plays or assisting   Berbatov or Rooney.    Id say we should start cheering him and he will just play that much better.|`|BGL2qhv8aa	Lol. The dude is kinda dumb. If you like him (very hard to do) you should carry on booing him. If you dont like him cheer for him.     He isnt a very good player compared to a lot of others.|`|AyHo8rnKaa	well it's to expect I wouldn't say he loves to be hated, i would say he knows his arrogant attitude will be bring hatred so he's got no choice but to get used to it.

ccEWxExfaa	I'm my own handicap.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I finished October (the last month we can play and report scores) at a 2.9 index (3.2 home course).|`|Wa7wktLkaa	my handicap is 1.8.    i average about 71 - 72 strokes (par 70)|`|ayLYuIvOaa	mine is about 5  my scoring avverage is about 76|`|5KUHrJtjaa	my handicap is 16.3, i won a captains away day september 2008, whitch reduced my handicap by 2.5  strokes. at that time i was probabley playing to 13 or 14,,,but just a little time after i injured my back and have been playing to a handicap of around  18/19...its taken at least three months to get baqck to normal, so my advice to you is excersize regualy keep the big mustles in your back working hard,,,hope this helps.|`|5Z5Crmvjaa	My index finished at exactly 3.0 this year.  My last 20 round scoring average was 79.2|`|uJPPxyewaa	Handicap was +1.1 for 2008. Stroke average was 71.0. Home course was actually a little worse believe it or not. I dunno, when you try to get to precise with shots on a course you are super familiar with, it seems like you press more. Playing new course usually yields a lower score for me.|`|6Xf0wOgPaa	I started last season at 22.0    Having a good season and winning several competitions I froze for winter at 14.5    I am ready for the next season to keep my score coming down. 9 is my target for this season.    I'm also helping the handicap secretary with handicaps and comps etc, so that should be good :D|`|LX0EOsCHaa	mine is 3 haven't played since October cause i live near lake Erie in Pennsylvania. home course par 70 ave score 73- 77|`|ajnGHNr8aa	My handicap is my clubs and my swing.

Strokes...you have to ask her!  btw, my game is better in the cold!    Happy golfing!|`|c6q3EERdaa	I've got the same problem (the Michigan winter sucks!)    My handicap is a 9.6.|`|sBrummATaa	my handicap is around 17. im not for sure but through 18 i usually  shoot mid 90's to low 100's. and i play on a really hard home course. i went to this other course for my high school team and shot 39 through 9 holes cuz thats how many holes we play in high school matches
6KZgeq3Maa	Starks, if his price drops well below the $7 million he was paid this year.  Smith is getting older and is always hurt nowadays...his best is behind him|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Starks yes-- Smith no--|`|DRPhJnXzaa	From both the football and business standpoint it makes better sense to stay with Max Starks|`|jwm0kQvNaa	I'm sure Starks will be resigned.  Smith will command more money, but he is too injury prone for a huge deal.  If he is willing to take a paycut, he could be back.|`|AA11806027	hard to say but I would go with stark as well.|`|LszMroCqaa	i like smith's game better, but he's always hurt.  they should re-sign starks and look at a tackle with their first round pick.|`|UQYurvnYaa	Starks. He younger which means hes got more time to get better and smith has been injured a lot so i say we keep Starks|`|AA10130483	Starks is the better investment... It doesn't matter how good Smith is if he isn't healthy enough to play...
fLpnC8qtaa	Would have liked to see him say it to their faces.lol..People like the foods they are accustomed to. No biggie.       "because I became a true player in Manchester"... that's the only thing of significance here !!|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Funny how a team with possibly fat and unfit players, a coach who cannot be understood and in a city with crap living standards went on to beat "perfect" Barcelona (Im sure you're viewing them that way in respect to ManU) to then go on and win the Champs League on top of Premiership and later Fifa World Club Cup.    Are you still sore from that?|`|bNykcEVXaa	I'm not sure what the point  of that was    We are STILL the DOUBLE HOLDERS...?  We Have the PL Trophy...?  We Have the CL Trophy...?    ..and we are WORLD CHAMPIONS.....?    dR bad  that post did not really change anything for me...  but I hope it cheered you up.. lol|`|El7C2JsMaa	A bit slow on the up take aren't you, this interview and then this question came out ages ago! If your going to take shots at us at least use some ammo that is relevant now!    And our diet didn't seem to do us any harm last season i actually remember us doing quite well and i also remember your supposedly fitter players were unable to break us down in 180 minutes of football, and before you say thats because we defended i would like to remind you that you supposedly have the best attacking team in the world so you shouldn't of had any troubles scoring at least one goal against a team who live off a diet of beer and burgers!|`|jLRpCt03aa	Haha MJ I swear we go to the same website! :P    He didnt HAHAAHAHA you naughty boy (or did he...?) LoL|`|MjPd9vyYaa	LMFAO. Does anyone know what Ferguson says I mean honestly! :P|`|HxET88bDaa	Oh that hurts so much. Not.    Just for the record, i don't really like Spanish food, but then you're not Spanish are you?

HAHAAHAHAHA|`|KOM1Bki8aa	it tells me that if barca meet MANCHESTER UNITED, there should be no excuses this time, barca should be able to beat a beer swilling, hamburger eating bunch of unhappy players.

2LrB58M7aa	It's not wrong! It's right to do so. Not everyone can be the "best" at something. You reward the "best". You can't have 11 "BEST" athletes. It makes no sense. Kids are too sensitive.|`|Ij154jW6aa	i would say it isnt wrong except there in midddle school. which is still pretty young. I def. say the the girl s with perfect attendance deserve something cause a parent cant argue that their kid should have gotten one beucase with things like that they either have it or they dont. But when it comes to stuff like best dancers it might not be fair to say so and so is better than the rest. but maybe like most improved awards. or something.
HJuOSvmdaa	Datsyuk--97 points last year.  Led the league in take-aways, won the Selke and the Lady Byng.  Played every game I believe, maybe missed one.  Zetterberg also did great.    However, Zetterberg misses games every season because of injuries, Datsyuk hardly misses games.  Also, they are both great offensively, but Datsyuk is slightly better defensively, so I say Datsyuk is the better player.    And I'm way happy they're on the same line again!!  Finally.    **edit  Also, Datsyuk leads the league in take-aways this year too!|`|YsAEPYwOaa	This is a really tough one, but imo Datsyuk is the more complete player plus he stays healthy whereas Zetterberg is a liability with recurring back problems.|`|7lQp3nHhaa	This year ?  Zetterberg|`|n6Z0GEhqaa	Zetterberg|`|m6lDXAmoaa	Datsyuk. Much better puckhandling, defensive play, and a more productive offensive player. Zetterberg is great, but usually he's better when he plays with Datsyuk. Zetterberg will probably get the C though once Lidstrom retires mainly because he can speak English and Datsyuk sucks at it|`|YN8Rbjogaa	Ovechkin.|`|YDhvLQsBaa	You can't look at statistics alone to answer this. I say Datsyuk because he is a threat on both sides of the rink|`|0qNbEif3aa	Hossa|`|f032a9377a7253c82261947a5d89dae5aa	Both of them have very different attributes.  I say that Datsyuk is a much better passer... he's a GREAT set-up man... while Zetterberg is a better goal-scorer.   I am NOT saying that Zetterberg is bad at passing and Datsyuk is bad at scoring... i'm saying that the strong points are those.  .  Zetterberg is more of a 'captain' like said previously. I don't think it's because of language barriers though, but I think it's just about leadership style.    Datsyuk got the Selke trophy for the best defensive forward, but Zetterberg got the Playoff MVP AND was in the running for the Selke as well.  And remember that incredible 5-on-3 that Zetterberg helped kill against the Pens in the finals? It was pretty incredible.  I am going to say Zetterberg as the better player.|`|F934e4HQaa	ZETTERBERG
lPDHMOVZaa	Minnesota Vikings... get Peterson and that run stifling defense a QB that knows how to win games and they won't be denied.

z43ao3eTaa	I wasn't really aware that ESPN loved Texas that much because all I usually hear is how great the "stellar defense" of overrated Duke is. But I agree, Texas is also overrated and they shouldn't be ranked as high as they are, if at all.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Probably not. I've got to agree with you, they are way overrated and the fans are too egotistical.
vIcOdePzaa	It depends on the track size as to how many laps there are.    PJ88 Fan I was not aware that you were sick. I know health issue can take a toll on you and get you down so please get better soon. I was sick for almost 7 weeks total but I got my results back from the hospital yesterday and I am ok. Just need to take things slow and I will be back to 100% in no time.      Scooter thank you for always checking in on me and begin there when I needed a friend and NASCAR Nation thank you for your thoughts and prayers especially the ones that have been there since the beginning, you know who you are and I couldn't have gotten through this without you.|`|juJwHsDJaa	I had no idea you were ill Terry-Lynn, I am sorry to hear that but I am glad you are OK. PJ88Fan you have a speedy recovery also.|`|zYuDstYLaa	The typical race has either 400 miles/laps or 500miles/laps. road course races are about 100 laps. I hope y'all get better soon!!! PJ and Terry Lynn, you are in my prayers.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Oh no!  PJ88 Fan and Terry Lynn 2 are sick?!  That's no good.  I hope they get better soon!    And for the answer, it depends on the length of the track.|`|AA10554783	It varies!|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Well it depends on the miles and the size of the track.  For instance the Daytona 500 coming up...Daytona is a 2.5 mile track so they will run 200 laps to have 500 miles.      PJ88 my dear friend...I know is having health troubles and my prayers are always with her....wishing her only "diamonds".      Terry Lynn I am sorry that you are ill. Feel better soon!!!!|`|nxymxSUFaa	Not a Nascar guy but hate to hear about illness striking anyone.  To PJ88 & Terry Lynn 2, get well soon!|`|YQLLxGNWaa	it varies from track to track. maggie mentioned daytona, another example would be a short track. at martinsville or bristol, both half mile tracks, they run 500 laps, so the races are only 250 miles. on a mile and a half track, i believe 338 laps equals 500 miles (i'm too lazy to do the math right now) it also depends on if the race is a '500' or a '400'. on road courses, they run kilometers instead of miles. so you see, it varies greatly.|`|9BtA5Knfaa	Depends on size of track!!!    PJ88, I had NO clue you were sick too, Take ALL your Meds. drink lots of fluids and get LOTS of rest! get well soon!!!    MISS T-L, Girl you gave some of us a big scare, I am SOOO glad your better. Anytime you need a friend KNOW that The KING will always be their!!!    GET WELL SOON, EVERYONE!!! The races are coming and you don't want to miss anything!!!|`|EHtFxGxMaa	It varies on the length of the race, and track.    Best wishes to PJ88 Fan & Terry Lynn 2....
DpfJfK6Baa	I pay you money and you give me attention, you dirty boy.|`|8qs1l3zVaa	it means a   whore except they don't take cash they take attention instead..hence attention whore....many of them use this section...spot them a mile off|`|LkpWUUwmaa	Ive been called many's a thing in my life,  but a whore well that's a first.

Regardless of who it is friend or foe i will never crawl or pander to anyone' regardless of who it may be, it's a footie section for goodness sake not a popularity contest. my humble opinion|`|8KB98h02aa	It's someone who will do, say, or  make up ANYTHING to have everyone feel bad for them. They always want sympathy, or any form of attention.     -I know an attention whore. She pretty much faked being on crutches for 3 years. (whenever she had a soccer game she was magically better) and currently is telling everyone about how she gets "teased" in school. She wants to file a complaint. She's best friends with the teacher also. She 'injured every bone in her body'. She was legitimatly hurt once, and I think she got a high off it and kept needing the attention.|`|2sxiHRvzaa	will the question last long enuff before it is reprted i wonder|`|8IzeMTmLaa	An attention whore is someone who craves and loves attention.|`|bzwSCm6taa	this place is overrun with them......|`|VpiYSQVnaa	it's kinda self explanitory isn't it??|`|BdiQPKn0aa	lol|`|S0LSmJ9haa	the reason it was written:    someone who will answer with what others want to hear, rightly or wrongly  someone who agrees with nastiness just because they have a liking for another user    whoring ones self for attention....|`|kfyDRQFSaa	whore is a prostitute.  So in this respect, it is someone that wants attention from anyone who will give it to them.|`|2payLxhxaa	Yea, careful with those Eugene. People on here are super-sensitive.

obPSaYf3aa	He died from a broken heart in that hotel that he time warped to and from.  Jane Seymour died naturally in the beginning of the film as an older woman, but freaked me out when she met him while he was younger at the theatre before she died, then the story unfolded.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I think he just stopped eating and died from heartache so he could be with Jane Seymour again (don't remember her movie name).|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Since this is the baseball section, I'll guess that he got beat up with a baseball bat.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	Blimp explosion.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	He died of boredom from that movie!!!!

Lots of other players also like Novak, Rafa, Rog, Haas, Stepanek, Mauresmo, etc|`|a660b30bb4b1d2b95aa24e1e5fbc9fbcaa	Yes he does a lot. I think that Andy Roddick himself said that a fan came up to him and asked if he was Stifler.|`|utKtg5Tsaa	i really think so, so much they could be siblings but totally different personalities|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Definitely not just you. People have been saying that for years now and even Andy himself makes fun of it. :-)|`|5nzgNWalaa	it's not just you :)   i've never thought about it but now that you mention it, i can see the resemblance.

OT7obUEHaa	THANK YOU!! Sometimes i think he doesn't get the attention he really deserves! I have been wondering all season if he was going to retire. He tore his ACL last season, but I knew he was going to come back. I want to say yes he will come back for another season! Rod pushes through pain and obstacles all the time. My guess is if he is done then it will be Whitney or Staal, but more than likely Staal.     OH and I LOVE Rod!!|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Don't have to like him to respect him.     "that's all I have to say about that" -Forrest Gump|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	Great player, great Captain. I just fear his nostrils.    I see him playing 1 more year then Staal will be capt., with one of his brothers on his team.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I respect him sure. But only to a point because he's been a key member of the Hurricanes teams that KO'd my Habitants out of the playoffs in both 2002 and 2006    thelau = Canes beat the Oilers in 2006, in 2004 it was the Lightning over Calgary|`|fdtB4XHtaa	he was my favorite player until he got traded and said philadelphia is the worst place on earth to live and he was glad to move. that said i still think he is a modern day great|`|1ApbWVhsaa	ALWAYS liked the guy.In fact got into arguments all the time with a friend who called him Hands of stone Brind'Amour.    Even when the talk of Rod's wife cheating on him with Lindros I never heard anything from him.That led him to be traded though.Might have traded the wrong guy.    Glad to see him raise the Cup in Carolina.|`|m6lDXAmoaa	I love Rod. He's like an ugly version of Stevie Y. I think he has another season left in him, he'll probably produce as much as Yzerman did in his final season as well|`|YsAEPYwOaa	To me Brind'Amour was always a good stable player you could rely on and even though he never set the world on fire when it came to scoring points, he was in the line up all the time putting out 100% every shift.  I'm happy that he won the Cup, but other than that he's not going into the HOF anytime soon or if at ever.    P.S. This is coming from a die-hard Flyers fan|`|1p1Jj7LDaa	Easily, be a Panthers fan.|`|p4H61jQDaa	rod is a class guy, gonna go in the hall of fame for sure. having a horrible season though|`|UoUaO52taa	I hate Brind'Amour because of what he did to the Sabres in the Conference Finals in 06 but I definalty respect him. I think he's done though and Staal will take over|`|lYnkvRASaa	I've liked him since his days with the Blues, great player and great competitor.  I hope he is not done, as long as he is playing there will be someone in the NHL older than me, if only by less than a week.    Realistically the end is near, Staal will be the next captain, hopefully he has learned something from Brindamour.    Edit: thelau, most of the good faceoff artists "cheat"  winning a faceoff is about getting every advantage you can.  Since the forced guys to line up square it has gotton better but it is a part of the game, everyone tries to do it.  Some like brindamour are better at it.|`|14K1Vt3Paa	From a Red Wing fan my compliments echo yours. One classy guy. Have often thought how good he would have looked in a Hockeytown uniform with Stevie Y. and Nik Lidstrom.  Hope he's back soon for you.|`|G33E41IBaa	I think Brind'Amour's done after this season, because he just hasn't been as productive as he has been in past years.  He only has 29 points so far, and he's a -30!  I agree that Staal will be the next captian.  I like Brind'Amour, because he's a classy leader.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I don't like Rod. I disagree with you though. If he was such a "great captain," how come he hasn't lead his team to the playoffs after the Cup win in '04? He didn't even have to lead by example on the ice, he could've done off-ice things to get his team motivated. I don't think he even cares anymore.    Also, he's a cheater. See if you can find any clips of him taking the face-off in '04 against the Oilers. Half of his body is on the Oilers' side a split second before the puck was dropped and nobody called it because he's buddies with the linesmen. I haven't seen too many 'Canes games since then so I don't know if he still does it or not.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	he will still play after this season even though his knee is hurt.    staal will be the next hurricanes captain    i like him considering he's my teams captain    thelau- it was 06 the hurricanes won and you obviously havent seen the hurricanes play considering you made that statement|`|a4b1ec29a0974990f99d1acb4a268821aa	I like Brind'Amour.... I don't know I always have! And I have to agree with you he makes a veryy GOOD Captain! Hopefully he'll be back before the end of the season and I still think he has a year or maybe two left in him! And yes if he retires after this season I think Staal will become Captain.|`|miE0PE3Paa	Rod Brind'Amour was a flyer and the flyers suck.  Therefore I don't like Rod Brind'Amour|`|V7dGe2kqaa	he is an ugly person.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Nothing but class there.|`|AA12172407	Character guy for sure. But he is having the worst season of his career, which may be an example of a guy playing too far past his prime?  I think the next captain should be Whitney (a grinder and producer no matter where he plays)|`|sLTvcDMFaa	Brind'amour is one of my favourite current players, and I really hope  that this is not his last year. No I don't think Staal is ready yet.|`|9wblT5sYaa	the only problem I have with him is that he looks like sloth from the goonies.  other than that I think he is a fantastic player, rough time around this year, but he had a great career.  I'm sure he'll contemplate retirement this year
iO12Vjnvaa	No Andrea, unfortunately you can't. Speed doesn't offer the service...the race will be on Speed...but they don't offer live online.  I hate that you will not be able to see it. I have took the day off....have to work the 15th and will miss over half of the 500 so the bosses are going to let me have the 12th off.

1ApbWVhsaa	He took ALOT less money to play on a Cup contender.Wasn't the Pens in the finals last year?I would say they were a Cup Contender as well..Why would he do that?He was in that locker room and saw Therrien wasn't a great coach and that the Pens lacked leadership.Now he looks like a genius...Plus,an absent Hossa might not be the reason the Pens are not in the playoff picture yet but ask them if they could use Hossas 28 goals 24 assists and +12 on their team?    I would say Clarkie has a point..|`|lYnkvRASaa	I tend to agree with Joe.  His point was there are problems in that room that Hossa wanted no part of.  Possibly.  He may have had issues with the coach or leaders on the team or felt that the Pens were about to regress.  Either way it wasn't money and as to the contender, he was on a contender last year.  Since there are few repeat winners signing with the wings, while a contender, in no way guarantees a cup.    to cut to the chase, he implied there was a problem in the room.  Does he know anything that we don't - maybe and maybe he is guessing.|`|brd6l4MAaa	From what I remember of comments and rumored comments made by a few of the UFA's that have since moved on, the Pens wouldn't offer them enough to stay on with Therrien. I'd say that might be the problem.|`|naZQqrNeaa	As much as I love Bobby Clarke......he is somewhat like George Foreman....his noodle has been knocked a few too many times.  I never take what he says too seriously (yeah, go ahead and thumbs down me).  The Pens are sucking lately, so, yeah, I would say there is a problem.  Does it have anything to do with Hossa?....hell no.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	You actually think that buffoon knows anything?? Little Baby Clarke couldn't figure out his own team and now he thinks he knows whats wrong with another.|`|AA12172407	He is implying that players don't want to stay in Pittsburgh, which is a weak argument.  Hossa is not Pronger (who pulled that lame excuse in Edmonton). Hossa simply wanted to be on a winner, and as Detroit won it last year, well...|`|KyCJOR2paa	Hossa knew that with the salary structure Pittsburgh has, that if he signed long term with them then there would be little left for a team.  When you have Malkin, Crosby, and Fleury eating that much cap space and add Hossa to the mix... well nothing would be left for nine other forwards and six defenseman.  He knows a top heavy team doesn't win Cups.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Gimme until next week and I will ask him.  He's gonna scrimmage with us Monday (possibly Friday) at the rink I play hockey at. His brother in law Jack (they're both from Flin Flon) is a good friend of mine.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I agree with Joe and CdnFan.       Beer Slayer........that "Buffoon" has forgotten more about hockey than you will ever hope to know. Christ man........it isn't Don Cherry you are talking about......say what you will about Charke, he has a hockey IQ that not many can match.      Those saying Hossa wants a chance to win.......as Joe points out CHRIST, Pitt was in the Finals last year....lotsa other guys bolted too.      I have heard that Therrien's act has worn thin, perhaps this dates back to last year Tom? I missed the comments!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	In the context of that discussion (and for the love of god, do they have Fonzie on as some sort of unintentional comedy?), I took from it that  Hossa had a real problem with Therrien (and later on, they all kind of dog-piled on Therrien) and/or the organisation as a whole.

AA10495394	I been to both Hornets and Bobcats games in Charlotte so I guess I can give you some sound advice. First off get to the game about 45 mins early at the latest. I assume you never been to a NBA game before so you will need help finding your seat. Second eat something at a restaurant before you go to the game. The prices for food are crazy and you want to spend the least amount of money that you can because the food isn't that good anyway. Third have fun.|`|KRf30XAHaa	park close enough but don't stuck so when u get to your car your stuck and cant get out, bring some money to but food it sorta expensive|`|Eu2n1w7Aaa	Just buy the $5 tickets. Very few people go to the games, so you can sit wherever you want for the most part.
1b056ae753a93a6725c73d5d98237d88aa	yes because players like him and played hard for him in the last two weeks of the season. We need continuity right now. Also Cable hired some of his own assistants like John Marshall for Defensive Coordinator and probably Al Saunders for offensive coordinator.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Absolutely.  He is the perfect "yes man" to Al, subject to mediocre results.  Any free thinking productive coach in the Raider history has been fired or left town because of the clash will Al.  Currently, Tom is the flavor of the month based on nothing other than being an extension of Al on the field.|`|iGYGJfgsaa	doesnt matter. Davis runs things and calls all the shots.Cable,a trained monkey,it doesnt make any difference. neither has any pull|`|tVEm2eJXaa	Yes because Tom Cable coached the Raiders when they beat the Bucs 31-24 on the road when the Bucs were playing for their lives to make it to the playoffs|`|8vCzgOlpaa	Only god knows because as far as Al is concerned that old bat has ruined the team|`|7Vka1VcOaa	For every good decision Al makes there are three bad ones. The game has passed him by. He should be combing a secluded beach with a metal detector.|`|RS3fjNboaa	It was probably more out of neccessity. Most of the available coaches had already signed with other teams. Plus Al Davis has burned a lot of bridges so most coaches don't want to work for him. He certainly can't get Gruden or Shanahan back, and he just fired Kiffen. I don't see that he had much choice in retaining Cable. We should get a pool going for what point of the season Cable will be fired next year.|`|cJyuXWNiaa	Lane Kiffin 4 life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Vj0chz3Eaa	I think he did.    The Raiders were one out of two west coast teams to win on the east coast. The Raiders humiliated a Tampa Bay team that was a win away from the play-offs.    The Raiders dealt a major blow to the Broncos in Mile High that cost them a play-off berth themselves.    Based on those two victories, does not sound too impressive. But what did the Raiders really have to play for? I think those victories contribute to what Tom Cable brings to the Raiders.     "Git-R-Done"|`|dCbIHBpGaa	When he first came in as interim coach things looked really bad and I thought we were in for even more humiliation than we are used to..and that's a lot. I think he really made a difference though and we looked pretty good towards the end of the season. I'm glad he got a chance to come back as coach. Now he just needs to win baby!|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	NO way he made the wrong move their was fired coach that was out there!|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yeah probably, cable is already  knee deep in it and it can't be an attractive job to other prospective head coaches with credentials so i would think cable can do the best job in the short term|`|o9DZledyaa	No, Cable doesn't have the resume to be a quality head coach. He went 4-8 with the team last year. He needed to bring in a guy to groom jamarcus russel.|`|ZlaxbI33aa	Since no other coach in their right mind would come play for skeletor then I say yes the Cable Guy was the right choice.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Cable is way better than dial-up|`|exOOXAkBaa	Yes, and now his team will suck for at least another decade. The truth hurts, doesn't it??? xDDDD|`|iL6UVfl4aa	Not sure...   but I am thinking the other way around, did Cable make the right decision staying there.  Oakland does not treat coaches the best and as long as if Davis is in control it will be tough for a young coach to get going.  A very controlling owner, and they do not make the best decisions.  I think oakland should have gone out and paid some serious money and get a big name GM
IxQzS9SEaa	Time and again he is proving it. He's not a good Indian Captain. Instead he is the Best Indian Captain|`|bettx8AYaa	mohinder sing dhoni best good in bating, kepers and captining. he win many cups like that.|`|CFSfyXCbaa	Dhoni is lucky as his players are playing very well with their work...  and as a captain Dhoni is not under pressure and simply playing his game without any tension.... so on comparing with other captains.. dhoni is lucky to have a team like this at present and he is contributing work and effort aswell...  (Rock on Dhoni, we dont care what people say on u, keep good friendship with team members and use all your tricks to maintain them fit all the time and simply win.....  we all are with u....)|`|MwjDCSLpaa	Without a doubt. Specially for walking in at  3 and flooring everyone with his batting.  Before  he became a Captain, he made tons at  3. He has given up this aggressive form for his captaincy. He sealed the innings.|`|a4b22dce5e4a9890ed45d849ca946d15aa	still you have doubt, i am not .It would have been better had he hit 100.|`|NHADK454aa	yes n i am proud to be frm his city and school|`|XqHk0jU9aa	yes, there's no doubt...|`|AA0L7X2Oaa	yas dhoni  captaan number 1 now|`|ICm7FG9Haa	yes|`|KeCLtvpGaa	yes he has proved that he is also best captain in this world and also proved that india is also the worlds best team|`|AA11088802	100% and good batsman too|`|KUXjoCiAaa	Yes he is a good caption & i think he is a good humen being too that's what i like about him.|`|rnY99OrGaa	He does prove he is  one of the best batsmen and a captain in his most matches. And i predict India will not need to search for another captain for 15 years.
IxQzS9SEaa	Ofcourse its true|`|ICm7FG9Haa	no, he is champion he know what he do|`|AA11088802	yes|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	i think luck riding captain will meat his doom near future~|`|a4b22dce5e4a9890ed45d849ca946d15aa	yes.|`|QtdO1RlQaa	Well he wanted to go after Jayasuriya and he did and paid for it. Poor shot selection on 94 atleast, but if he had pulled it off, we would have been saying something else so dont blame him.............
0rRu6mwJaa	Bosingwa would have been cursed by the Lord cuz Yossi is an Israeli      THe Lord said, " Abraham, I will bless those, who bless you & curse those, who curse you."|`|lhASsVwcaa	Bosingwa would of been laying on the floor, whilst Gerrard had been sent off for knocking him out.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	would be getting 3-4 red cards........advance for the next season|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	gerrard would hav immediately dived again and got booked|`|7Xridrxaaa	I heard Bosingwa is a suspected HAMAS member... oh wait you meant Gerrard.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	So you're saying Gerrard is a thug? We knew that already.    Bc no provocation on the pitch warrants a rebuttal. You always lose out if you do. Case in point? Zizou.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Same as what would have happened if Gerrard had kicked John Terry.|`|ndqYQGYXaa	They both would have went.|`|4VgPiwRqaa	Gerrard would have won the appeal cos the fans luv him...|`|7dROG925aa	what would have happened if roy keane was the captain?  bosingwa would have his *** wooped!!    bosingwa sucks! no player should show that level of respect to another player..benayoun was cool!|`|UUT4rj3zaa	am a Chelsea fan n i luv them 2 bitz but i say dat gerrard wud of punched him bak or wud of retaliated!!  but they deserved it, n it aint Chelsea's fault if the linesman or the ref didnt do anytin bowt it!!!  Go Chelsea FC!!!|`|64M2xWyAaa	i would have cheered a little louder|`|JHAqEETmaa	Jos (lol) Bosingwa is a product of FC Porto football school: violent, cheater and having no fair-play.  Still, he has a thing all coaches admire: he does what the coach says and gives 100% in every single game.   Nevertheless, he has an handicap: he's Portuguese. If he was english, french, italian, spanish or german no one cared if he was violent or something else. Just watch the "good" examples of Gattuso, Puyol, Makelele, Ferdinand, etc that are always doing violent and rough tackles. Not good examples of choir boys...|`|xLyNsywiaa	Gerrard would probably have gotten right back up, then fallen back down like he'd been stabbed...|`|vpZJ6rZzaa	Lool
fLpnC8qtaa	I'm surprised we haven't already !    @jyoti..if thats the case I'd be a bit worried. Rafa hasnt always brought the best player for money to the club. His track record would have needed to be better for me to give him that control.|`|lhASsVwcaa	I expect to see it the end of the season, im a liverpool fan and i beleive he is cracking up, he's only good for the champions league in slower case games!    UP MOURINHO!|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Give it some time. May 2009 maybe? :P|`|Sl2CZoEHaa	Probably not for a very long time, just like Alex Fergusun|`|iQvkT8Doaa	The clown just entertains us all so keep him there for another 100 years...err this summer when Liverpool sell Torres and finish 5th.|`|7Xridrxaaa	this summer he is gone! He hasnt signed his new contract because he isnt signing it. Another dissapointing year for Liverpool.|`|L1QTSErIaa	Benitez has just signed a new 4 year contract. And more significantly, he now has full control over the running of the team and the purchasing of new players.   Looks like he has no reason to leave.|`|4VgPiwRqaa	I dont think he'll resign 4 along time but I reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally hope he does.  He only wants to help Spain by buying spainiards all the time and not letting good english talent through.|`|7dROG925aa	hmm,not in the coming months..because there will be a new owner? more money..than we'll see if he spends wisely this time..  if he fails to deliver after that, he'll get the boot..    but currently, he's doing quite good..|`|xlyk63xRaa	if we get the funds to buy players he will stay, why woud he stay if the owners aint gonna let him manage the team. we need some good signings, and a team of liverpools caliber should and will attract an owner if who invests into the team will probably win every competition we enter.|`|qO7nbSQVaa	As an Everton fan i hope i never see it. The man is a clown  and him and Liverpool deserve each other, if Fat Raf was to leave then God forbid they might actually get someone decent in charge and nobody this side of Scandinavia would want that  so carry  on Rafa you are doing a wonderful job/|`|AA10510647	to-day,,,|`|UUT4rj3zaa	hopefully very very soon!!!!!!!!

qO7nbSQVaa	My all time top premiership player of all time in his prime but he is knocking on a bit now and he has hardly set the world alight while in Spain so maybe he is one of those players who can only really play for one club and i dont support Arsenal.|`|lhASsVwcaa	Love him.    Henry and Torres    Beware defenders.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I don't support a Premiership team but I would find it weird if he went anywhere but Arsenal :D|`|nBDDO8L3aa	yes      hotman|`|8yMkjeDdaa	back to arsenal plz we need you!|`|UUT4rj3zaa	no tnx!!  Chelsea by da waii!!|`|BGL2qhv8aa	I think Henry is the best player ever. He needs to come back to Arsenal. He ain't doing brilliantly in Spain and Arsenal ain't doing brilliantly in England.     He needs to definitely come back to Arsenal. It would be kinda strange to see him in a Man Utd shirt after all those bitter matches.|`|ndqYQGYXaa	Definetly, He is awesome.|`|RqPB9S5saa	yes  i would love to have him in  MAN UTD|`|gPsFFQbRaa	well he is a good player, maybe yes.|`|i9wtYB1Daa	T.Henry  one of the best player in the world so there is no doubt I want him at my club  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|7dROG925aa	yes!!
7x4VtGtFaa	Lovely piece of skill by Gos!|`|bGuVAltxaa	Unfortunately I had a tener on Cahill to score the 1st goal so I watched the whole game.|`|YqEPE90raa	I watched the first half on ITV the match was boring.|`|h1QqA9XGaa	Everybody missed it as they put the adverts on.Itv have said sorry.|`|AA11447659	i didn'tmiss it, the matchsticks held my eyes open. Nearly missed it though because of ITV's shoddy coverage. was watching ads while the match was on for about 10 seconds. while i'm on the subject of ITV, some one should get rid of the Tyldsley and Beglin double act. completely boring commentary with the odd opinion (I don't want Opions) i want commentary thank you|`|fjidmhxsaa	It was funny I must say.  ITV decided to air a commercial just during the game... not know the implication of such act.  I personally will say "injury time" games be left to run until the referee blows his whistle. No ad, no break, no stunt.    Apologies to the guys who missed out on the goal.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I caught it on-line. I could sniff a Toffee goal was just around the corner so I swear I tuned in 5 mins before it haha :D|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No i saw it, i watched it to the end|`|YuAndWj6aa	I think everyone who was bored missed it..  Horrible match, absolutely boring. Sounds like Arsenal now|`|KOM1Bki8aa	luckily i have UTV tuned in on my sky box so as soon as it went to ads i turned over, i just caught it !
qO7nbSQVaa	I agree with just about everything you have said apart from the "he used to be a good manager " bit, When was he a good manager ?was it 2005 and the fluke win in the Champions league final ?face facts the second half of that game was a massive fluke whereas the first half where they were hammered has to be credited to Fat Raf. Winning that game was the worse thing that coluld have happened to Liverpool because all the fans suddenly thought that the sun shone out of Rafas **** and they have paid the price ever since. At least the fans appear to be finally seeing through him and people such as you are beginning to say sack him but unfortunatly for you i think you are stuck with him for a bit yet.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	LMFAO - did you say this after the Chelsea win, hmmm didn't think so|`|SiOjEH00aa	perhaps.  im a liverpool fan, and he makes me so mad sometimes, with the team decisions he makes. sometimes i just think i could of chosen a better sub than him.  but i don't hold anything against him for last night, FA Cup was Liverpool's 3rd priority, after the Premiership and the CL    if liverpool don't come at least second this campaign i would consider wanting him to go.  but, it could ruin liverpool, because many of the big name players, such as torres, alonso and mascherano have said if rafa is sacked they will demand to leave.    gives us a problem, doesn't it?|`|gPsFFQbRaa	maybe|`|KR3IvxNwaa	i know,, it's tough time for all Liverpool fans (no offense).|`|j3xwgrLBaa	Benitez has taken liverpool from a team as good as the current Everton to a team that are genuinley able to win the title    Under Hollier we only just scraped into the champions league and when we got there were beaten by Bayer Levercusen (which under Benitez we beat 6-2)  and then Benitez's own Valencia ran riot at Anfield    Do you think a valencia side would out class us now?  Has any other Liverpool manager won the champions league with Neil Mellor and Djimi Traore?    Benitez is THE man|`|UUT4rj3zaa	YH!  SACK HIM...SACK HIM...SACK HIM...SACK HIM...SACK HIM!!!  by da way am a CFC fan n am proud of it n our manager!!!!  Go Chelsea FC!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|ndqYQGYXaa	No way.  He is the best Manager they have had for years.|`|iwsQ7jmNaa	Don't be so ridiculous!
f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	Either.    If I have to choose, I'd say 2 piece so it's easier for her to go potty.     Don't forget the sunscreen!!|`|Cv2h6n1Raa	one piece. less sun exposure and they are really cute|`|64385ef35ffd1ced4b7ff5149c5d39abaa	2 piece if you are going with the swim shirt and bottoms type. One piece if you were looking at the bikini style 2 piece. The nice thing about the two piece w/swim shirt is that they are covered more by the shirt so less harm done by the sun (or if in an indoor pool it keeps the warmer), also if they have to use the restroom it is a whole lot easier to get just the bottoms off rather than the whole suit.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	2 piece is easier|`|u4kxB7cmaa	1 Piece =)  x

eQQegpayaa	Chi Gong breathing; standing meditation using postures such as hold the ball See the book 'Stand still and be Fit by Lam Kam Chuan for general postures; single-pointed focus meditation; yoga and spontaneous body stretching to open up the body's energy lines; correct cultivation and circulation of sexual energy to increase Jing-essence is the most important way to increase available chi.  Eating a diet which gives the highest amount of nutritional intake with the lowest amount of digestion time and cutting out bad eating habits i,e refined foods. Making sure the body gets the right amount of sleep, rest, relaxation and physical exercise.  Work out daily morning and night out doors near trees if possible as the sun is rising and setting, the earth's natural chi is at its height at these times and can be absorbed through chi gong breathing methods.  Cathartic work to clear any mental blockages and so enhance the smooth passage of chi through the body.  Massage, body beating and skin brushing to eliminate toxins and make the body pliable.|`|uToFh7Beaa	Control your breathing and put your hips into your techniques.|`|1AgD0dsBaa	If you practice QI Gong! Forms and breathing. Shao Lin or other forms of Chuan orms and breathing. Many hours and focus.   As you develop your motions you will begin to understand the flow of how your Chi works. Once you have done this move on.|`|AA11410928	Tai Chi|`|89556dca283d8c3b071750cfae20ff95aa	To understand Chi is to improve Chi. There are too many people just don't understand what Chi is.  Chi is an energy within your body, only little bit to start with but as you trainned, you will build it up. But MUST UNDERSTAND TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE!|`|73wpIlgnaa	practice your techniques and learn correct body mechanics (assuming you are using it for martial arts) qi gong exercises.      Qi isn't going to give you superhuman abilities, or abilities at all... qi is merely the knowledge of your body, the kinetic force you create in your limbs, and the control of your breath.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	First of all understand it.  The popular thought is that ki or chi is a form of "energy" like electricity, or worse, like "The Force."      It's not.  A lot of studies have been done on chi, and not one of them measures any unusual energy coming from any martial artist.    That doesn't mean it's not real.  Chi, best as I can tell after a lifetime in the martial arts, is really just an intense level of concentration and mental discipline.  When you're "chied up" you won't feel fear, or as much pain.  You'll feel powerful.  You'll also have a level of concentration that is only rivaled outside the martial arts by world class athletes who are "in the zone."      I'd be willing to consider that chi might be some kind of voluntary hormonal response, but I haven't seen any studies to that effect.    You can imrpove chi in the following ways:    1) Proper breathing.  Air is life.  2) Meditation.  Learn to quiet your mind as this will allow for greater concentration.  3) Sparring.  This will help you control panic and stress response.  Allowing for greater concentration.  4) Hard exercise.  There's a reason Shaolin Monks are so fit.  Running stairs and working hard in class will build chi better than a hundred hours of sitting on your butt and breathing.    I also reccomend learning breaking techniques.  Not absolutely necessary, but I find it to be a rewarding example of the power of chi.    I probably sound like a skeptic.  I am.  But I've also seen (and even done) things with chi that defy explanation.  Just because its not magical doesn't mean its not powerful.    Good luck!|`|vi177FW2aa	Meditate|`|v1mbL56caa	Breath
r5AMG8g7aa	Kyusho-Jutsu is not an art. It is a high level of bunkai or application of techniques taken from traditional kata. Some karate dojo teach it most do not simply because they don''t know it. In a traditional dojo it is not talked about. Only a few senior students (read as high level black belts) are taught the applications.  Today many people are claiming to teach Kyusho-Jutsu, when in fact either what they teach is not Kyusho, or it is not the true Kyusho and they don't know any better.  Bottom line is that finding the real Kyusho is not easy. Most of the legitimate instructors that know it will only teach it to students that have been around a long time. This is for two reasons. The knowledge without flawless technique is useless. The second reason is that they simply will not give out that kind of knowledge to just anyone that wants it.
lBhkWpDoaa	id say no, but in Costa interview he down played it|`|fefYXm71aa	no big surprise|`|iPWKzzQtaa	Aaron gets a pass because greenies were a standard issue in the game when he played. If you know baseball you should know that.    Any hint that Babe Ruth took steroids, or the steroids have been around since the 1800's is totally misleading and doesn't belong in this question.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Greenies were very popular. All the ballplayers took them!!!|`|AA11828439	I have not read the book, and am unwilling to take your word for it. I will withhold my opinion until I see it in print.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	I think a lot of players took what is called "greenies".  Mike Schmidt has admitted to taking them.|`|geih5vR8aa	A lot of them took amphetamines. Willie Mays said he and bunch of other guys would take some red pills, and they said all it did was make them feel energized (like amphetamines do). They took them because a grueling schedule in the MLB wears you down.     Steroids have been around since the late 1800's. You never know if Babe Ruth took them. They didn't test for the stuff back then... and hey, that would help explain why he was so fat (if you don't work out, it turns to fat), yet he's so damn strong... and why he's hitting 40+ HR's, and everyone else is hitting 5. We can't go back and test every major league player. We can get pissed off at guys like Clemens and Bonds, guys who are jerks, and we can get SUPER pissed off at them when there's evidence that there is steroids... YET, it was obvious from the get go that they were taking them. We don't need a Grand Jury, or Federal Investigation.    I don't hold it against any of these guys to take steroids or HGH, or Amphetamines. They can do to there bodies, whatever they want. I do think that it's unfair to other players who don't take steroids, because they know it's wrong to cheat.     It's too hard for these guys not to take drugs. It's right there in there face. There trainers give them stuff, because the guys are looking for an edge. That edge is the difference between $5 million, and $20 million. It made more and more ball players take the drugs, because they wanted to get the fame, and money. It boils down to greed.    I don't hold it against them for taking these drugs. What I hold against them is there greed. They need to take substances like steroids or amphetamines to give themselves an unfair edge over guys who refuse to take it.    I hold guys like the owners, managers who obviously knew about all this and did nothing (cuz they wanted to win, so they turned a blind eye), and more importantly, Bud Selig. He practically shot these guys full of steroids... and don't tell me he didn't know about it. He use to own a team, so he knows what's going on in the club house. The guy earned $17.5 million in 2007, which was more than EVERYONE IN BASEBALL, except A-Rod, Jeter, and Giambi. His pay depends on how many people are watching baseball... and his moto was, "Whatever is good for baseball". The guys took drugs to hit the long ball, because that's what was good for baseball.    The owners, managers, and players have EVERYTHING riding on winning. They took steroids, or turned a blind eye to them for personal benefit.    All of baseball should be condemned, not Bonds or Clemens, or McGuire. EVERYONE. They were all greedy in some way, shape or form.  The players just got greedier and greedier.    I'm sure Joe Torre knew some of his players were taking steroids, or abusing other drugs, but he never said anything about it while he was coaching the team, because he wanted to win, and he was afraid of losing his job.    Also, the only reason why people think that steroids in baseball is new, is because over the last 20 years, they have found ways to make steroids better, and how to use them in different ways. They're not just to make yourself stronger or faster, they are used to help in recovery of injuries... etc.  Several retired players have come forth and talked about that.  It's the greed of guys like Clemens and Bonds that made them abuse steroids even more... it's like, "Hey, if everyone is on steroids, then I'm gonna do even MORE of them, so I can be the one with the advantage."    I think steroids have always been around professional sports. It's just now, they are mainstream, and more players are using them for a variety of reasons.|`|obPSaYf3aa	It would have to be the same standard by Barry Bonds and the 1000's of other professional athletes taking suspicious substances.  At the time, amphetamines were not banned or really "out in the open" as a recreational drug of choice in the baseball circles, although they were "common" on any street corner in the 60's and 70's.    Same thing goes for Barry Bonds if he took them in the late 90's to early 00's.  The "cream and clear" were undetectible and therefore were not known of or banned or made illegal by MLB, so Barry Bonds and others that used those substances at that specific time before MLB added them to the banned list are actually innocent!    It's been documented by Henry in TV and in print for his amphetamine usage and the naysayers and skeptics are just too young to know what happened in the 60's & 70's because they were not born yet and did not experience what occurred in baseball, which was more raunchy and free spirited than the "baseball of today".|`|ozVqauMXaa	Amphetamines were not illegal when he played, and they certainly weren't banned by baseball, so no, I wouldn't hold it against him.
dCbIHBpGaa	Yeah I was starting to think that in his old age Al had forgotten that he hadn't got a coach! Good choice though. Cable looked like he was starting to get things going at the end of last season.. a 2 game winning streak is big news for the Raiders!!|`|8vCzgOlpaa	Yes i think they made a very good choice in keeping him what took so long!!!!|`|1b056ae753a93a6725c73d5d98237d88aa	yes because players like him and played hard for him in the last two weeks of the season. We need continuity right now. Also Cable hired some of his own assistants like John Marshall for Defensive Coordinator and probably Al Saunders for offensive coordinator who are two experienced coordinators. The only thing I might be afraid of is that can Jamarcus Russel learn a 800 play playbook that Saunders has for him.|`|7nDpz7vyaa	Yes, I am happy Cable is staying.

WLXFAeSnaa	It's off the guy who gets the ball thrown at him.|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	i say off the player standing out-of-bounds, when the ball crosses the boundary in air it is still in play and can be saved. It is not out of bounds until it hits a player with feet on the ground out of bounds or the ground.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	its off the player who is standing out of bounds.  you see it in games from time to time.  its the same as when someone gets a pass, but part of his feet are out of bounds, results in a turnover.|`|rEafx4QTaa	the player that is not inbounds is therefore out of bounds thus, if u throw it off of them and they are out of bounds then the ball would be last touched by the player that is standing out of bounds thus the ball would go to the player that threw the ball|`|kFcdwVwdaa	idk the rule itself but from what i have seen in games, if the opposing player was already outside before the ball was going out of bounds, the other player cant throw the ball at him since he was off of the floor. in the other hand if both players were going for the ball and one of the players was on the line or out of bounds, then the other player can still throw the ball off of him.|`|FUoKu13Daa	did not quite get your question but if a player if out of bounds for whatever reason then his body is like out of bound,    example when u see this fairly often,  lets say people are grappling for a rebound and someone basically get push out of bounds and the opposing team accidentally throw the balls at the person who is out of bound from the other team, then that person who last had the ball in bound would get a turnover for throwing the ball out of bounds because the person out of bounds is like it saids "out of bounds"|`|AA12036375	I think you are right, but I am not sure if he doesn't catch it or even try to, then I believe it would be against the player that threw it.|`|UGFzZrW5aa	The TO will be given to the one who threw the ball, Im preety sure of that..Because He is already in the Out of Bounds, thus means that he is apart of the Out of Bounds so i think, If the Player threw a ball to aplayer outside, it is similar to throwing it to the cameraman,,haha|`|S5vzpS4qaa	the player standing out of bound is the one who is out.

O4CimCZuaa	Honda doesn't have a buyer yet, but the team did say that they are still developing their cars for '09 and insist they'll be at Melbourne. If this is true, then yes, we can expect Jenson back, but as for Rubens, I want to say yes, but I don't think he will. I think Bruno Senna will replace him should Honda decide to replace Rubens.

LDVEzHsvaa	I truly dont think there is going to much in it this year.    It will mainly come down to rider / crew chief, for the big points.    Now, lets take Colin Edwards. Same rubber as Vale ( as everyone ) this year, great team and the massive brain power of  the great Guy Collen.    He might look like a currly haired nutter, but his mind is on another planet.    Now lets take Valentino Rossi.............. stop laughing at the back of the class.............. this is the real deal !!    Top rider / Top rubber / best handling bike / TOP CREW CHIEF. Jerry Burgess invented water spray cooling. The W.R.C teams of Subaru & Mitsubishi both copied his idea for road / rally cars.    Buress thought, whilst with M . Dooohan , if you could cool the manifold of the header pipes with a spray of water, it would fool the 2 stroker screamer engine into thinking the pipes where longer, hence giving more power.    It worked. The man is god - like.    This is just one of many that J.B has come up with.    You put Rossi & J.B together and look what happens !    It was said that for the first year that Yamaha / Rossi & J.B were together, Burgess got the same 12 month salary as Rossi. True ? Who knows, but he is worth his weight in gold.    The Tech 3 boys will be quick, Colin is riding his last year in MotoGP and J52T needs to podium this year or it might be bust for him.    The UK ( sadley ) brings no money into MotoGP. He is racing for his 2010 deal.|`|ZQCBqYTbaa	I have just answered a question from Wiggysan agreeing with Ciccio that the yamaha bikes are very close in comparison. and think the only difference (last year) was purely down to set up, with Fiat getting the upper hand. this year might be different if yamaha have something new to try , hard to tell through the winter test ban as no testing was done and there was nothing to see. this test in sepang might throw us a clue in the next 2 days.

0HO8sTGeaa	ya... hope so like that... liverpool are nothing without gerrard|`|lhASsVwcaa	Liverpool need him because of the moral, when he went off the team werent the same but yet we still had top quality players on the field.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Somebody came up with a mathematical equation yesterday:    Liverpool minus Gerrard = West Brom.|`|duJgBxUoaa	2-1     :)|`|iQvkT8Doaa	We'll see why they are a one man team. Fabregas our best player is out but we've not lost a game in sometime. Ha|`|XU1KaWXwaa	he is our best player, but i think we faultered 1stly the team was probably set up around him and 2ndly lucas got sent off which didn't help us. Also we done alright in that period near the start of the season without gerrard, because we gt alonso and we can just play 442. with kuyt and benyoun.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	Well we beat united with out him and torres.|`|AA11510511	Well they are now going to have 0-0 draws or lose games.    Liverpool count too much on Gerrard.|`|JCRdicqXaa	Expect them to lose every game until he returns.    If you add Torres to the injury equation and for a longer spell a mid-table position is the best they could hope for.|`|xlyk63xRaa	ok....lets stick gerrard against chelsea or united, on his own...sure yes he is a one man team, thats if you believe in fairy tales. it takes a team to win a game, and he is the fckin captain for gods sake, every team has one so whats so special about liverpool having one  oh yea i forgot that anything we do is abused, if we have a good captain he must be the only player on the pitch of any use.  gerrard is central midfield, obviously its going to be tough not having him around, because he is our CAPTAIN not because he is a one man team, we will adjust just like we did without torres we still topped the league.  in other words plain and simple ... dream on|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	He will surely be missed and with Torres still unfit I think Liverpool will be in trouble.|`|bxV80Clnaa	We aren't going to win it full stop. Man Utd are just too strong at the moment.    but then they will get destroyed by Messi & co's Barcelona in Europe|`|bGuVAltxaa	Liverpool will surely drop a lot of points while he is out, Gerrard is the driving force of the Liverpool team, also they might have got away with it early in the season when they lost him for a few games, but this is a crucial stage in the season and you need your top players, and with Torres not looking fit, Liverpool will struggle in the next few weeks.|`|STLnjU7Raa	whaT tittle bid|`|iLCc3bplaa	They are a one man team|`|7dROG925aa	i wont say they are a 1 man team..but a huge loss,no doubt..    i value leverpool higher than chelsea...i think lvpool will be challenging us all the way|`|VMOUhy85aa	The team should be renamed Gerrard FC!  I don't think they can cope half as well as a team when he isn't on the pitch.|`|HlEU7lNGaa	This will certainly be a test for Liverpool. Gerrard means more than just the center of the field, he is a big part of the heart and soul of the club.

It will come back to haunt Rafa selling Keane why o why did he not wait another three months  to sell him. Or even sell him on the 1st January  giving us time to replace him.  End of the season I think.|`|eBxelfhKaa	Hes a twat|`|nwwhfuADaa	liverpool fans just dont seem to realise that they dont perform half as well without their playmaker Gerrard however much you hint it to them|`|UUT4rj3zaa	its so kl dat he aint playin for agiis coz he's a gud player wich is bad 4 us!!1  am a Chelsea fan n am proud of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|cUJbhspDaa	its up to mascherano and alonso to show their worth and be leaders but rafa dont play lucas sell him|`|rzPMzoxzaa	What title bid was that,have I missed something.|`|KOM1Bki8aa	I think they could play better without his influence, sometimes stevie g hits 10 to 15 long balls in one game with only one being cutting edge, if they set out to try and play, they can stroke the ball about, unfortunately for them their next game is against a team , portsmouth who will get stuck in and Stevie's big balls would have brought them through that game.

(probably you'd pick galaxy, but others would pick Milan) besides, hes doing very well in AC and i don't see a reason of why he should go back..|`|VpiYSQVnaa	your question doesnt make sense. The whole point of him going to milan was so he could earn himself a spot for the national team and he happens to be doing great there. If he wants to stay, it's his decision and as far as the getting old part, many players have played well into their 30's before, in maldini's case 40's. Some even get better with age.

Edit: Ok, didn't realise you were 12 and not old enough to understand.

He can't really play for an English side now, so the best team in Europe playing alongside KAKA, MALDINI, RONALDINHO, INZAGHI...(need I go on...) will just have to do!

ucot94w3aa	If you're 210, you should have probably been riding a much bigger board than a 159 for freeriding.  I would think you might want to go a little bigger for a park board as well.

Anyway 156 is  small for you, its based upon height and weight....sure its got pop, but you're going to "de-pop" it very quickly, the natural camber in the jones deck will surely be affected by the stress you put on it due to your size...I would suggest rocking a 159 in the park and step up to an Arbor Element 163-66 for your all mountain board...|`|HkwUGOmxaa	I think what ever works for you is fine. You said it feels good? Cool then. I am also 6'2" and 210. I ride a 162 Ride Dose (wide) for evrything. The length gives stability, the width for stability and float, and It is good for everything. I am getting a ride DH next year because of some new things they are doing and that board will have all of their new technologies. I personnally think that board is a bit small but to each their own. As long as it feels good ya know. As far as what burton recommends for that board I am sure you are off the charts. As long as you keep the longer board around for powder days I am sure you will be fine. Heck the 162 even seems short to me on powder days...I am in Colorado and been riding for 16 years and have worked in the snow industry for 8. It is up to the individual, where and what you ride. When you ride and for how long.|`|9ba14fd979418107a444a95b817d18fbaa	Yep agree with the other.  You're on the short end of the stick.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	The best tip I can give you for trout fishing anywhere is to get off the beaten path.  The easy spots near roads and public parking spots get hit early and often, try to find places that are harder to get to and you will find more and bigger fish.  Talk to the locals to see what flies work best for that area if you are fly fishing.  I have mostly fished them with nightcrawlers and had great success over the years.  Some  6 Tru Turn hooks, different size split shot sinkers and a couple dozen crawlers are all you need if you go that route.  Use a light enough split shot so that the crawler will drift down stream a little when you bump it.  I carry an old plastic container from when I used to chew as my "tackle box", a pair of needle nose pliers and a stringer making it easy to cover a lot of ground/water. I like to have a couple of Panther Martin spinners on hand also, in a couple of different colors.  Good luck!|`|3VlWqIk2aa	I grew up in  west Pa and mostly fly fish. However if you are using a spinning rod you cant beat meel worms for trout. use a small hook size 10 or 12 or even smaller if you can.  do not use any weight instead use a small float (bobber) adjusted to vthe depth of the stream you are fishing. you want the bait to be just above the bottom.  If you are not getting snagged once in a while you are not low enough. I like to use slip on floats that are used for fly fishing or you can also use the stick on kink. It looks like a number 8 that folds over and sticks to itself. you can get these  at any fly shop and they can show you how to use them.  Hope this helps, feel free to email me  Lee|`|lLRTxFJbaa	I am just a beginner fly fisherman myself, but I did live at State College in Central Pa. for a year, and I know that President Jimmy Carter flyfished in the area.  Ask anyone up there where he fished.
ZzXxRLWcaa	After a players first 1 1/2 season, but before his 6th season he's an "arbitration" player. (I think that's the time frame, something like that).    So baiscally during the offseason when the player is up for a new contract he may say I'm worth "X" number of dollars, but his club will say he's only worth "Y" amount of dollars.    When they cant agree the contract goes to arbitration where a judge determines what the fair market value of the contract is. Both sides present their case and then a binding decision is rendered.    The factors the judge looks at include comparisons to similar players, stats and more nebulous things such as playoff performance. A prives is decided on and both parties must left with it|`|4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	All players have contracts - but it is the length of Major League service time that determines how that contract is done.    - A major leaguer can not become a free agent until he has accumulated 6 full years of major league service time.    - If that major leaguer has a minimum of three years of major league service, but less than six full years and does NOT sign a contract covering any of that time period (years 4,5,6 - i.e. Jason Bay). that player is eligible for binding arbitration in each of those seasons. In addition, the top 17% of major league players with the most ML service time, but totaling less than three full years are also arbitration eligible (known as "Super 2's").    - Players with less than three full years service time and do NOT qualify as Super 2 arb eligible? They are at the mercy of their team as to how much they will be paid. You will most likely read about this in the transaction line; "Team X renewed the contracts of Players Y & Z"    -In the arbitration process, the player submits a figure for his yearly salary, as does his team. After each side presents their case, the arbiter makes his decision and awards the case to either the player of the club. No compromise - either the player wins or the club wins.    Binding arbitration was approved by the owners some years ago to resolve contract disputes. The club chooses whether or not to offer arbitration to any of their free agents. If they do, and the played declines the offer - they are free to sign wherever they wish. However, if the player accepts arbitration, he is considered a signed player .... and like the old joke goes ... now all we have to do is argue about price.    Now, before the hearing comes up, the player and the club can still negotiate a deal. If they can come to terms, the hearing is called off. If not, then the process goes to conclusion.|`|PD7s4j00aa	http://baseball.suite101.com/article.cfm...|`|3mZyMnjfaa	its where a judge decides how much money the players going to make after listening to the player and the ownership make their cases for how much they should make

b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	The two are very different disiplines so trying to state which is harder and more dangerous is difficult.  They are both high risk, high consequence sports, which means when it does go wrong there are usually nasty results.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Since I am a motocross racer I may be biased, but it seems there are more frequent bad injuries in motocross. The thing that makes motocross so dangerous is the insane huge jumps. When you come up short on a big jump it generally sends you on your head/neck which is very dangerous. Yes road guys hit much higher top speeds but generally I see road race crashes in corners when they are not at full throttle. On the other hand MX guys are tapped out wide open when they hit a 70 foot jump and if they don't make it, not only are they crashing at a high rate of speed but also have a drop from a couple stories in the air. As far as hard from a physical standpoint there is no question motocross racing is more physically demanding, it is in fact the second most physically demanding sport in the entire world. Not taking anything away from the road guys, they are true athletes and I would not want to do what they do.|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	well, the are both dangerous... i think the road is more dangerous because you are going much faster on a much heavier bike...  i have been riding and racing motocross for 7 years now... it takes alot of time and dedication to get good on the bike... but if you like the speed and the jumps you race supermoto... i have raced supermoto a few times with my buddies it is good fun you should look into it... but think about it lifes no fun if you dont put any danger into it...|`|QLMW7HRMaa	Depends on the rider.  They are as different and american Football and Basketball.     A completely different sport and different athletes.|`|Agl9ZpnEaa	I don't think anybody can decide which is harder really.  Both take an incredible amount of time and practice to master.  But as far a danger, there is no question in my mind.  Motocross is more dangerous.  The whole idea of speed and jumping combined just really makes motocross dangerous.  Sometime you have 3 wide going off an 80ft triple all tapped out and whipping it and stuff.  Plus, the safety gear that the road racers are able to wear is sooo much better.  In the end, check the injuries....motocross dominates injuries.  Gotta love all forms of motorcycle racing though! Check out my source pics for proof!|`|TwWhKegxaa	For me, they are both harder!  However, road riding?  AKA street racing is the most dangerous period.
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	At the moment I would still say the Leatt brace, as I really have not heard a lot of information in regards to some of the newer types of protection that have only just started getting around.      Perhaps yahoo answerer Rough_Neck may be on here later as I know he said he had just bought the EVS brace and may be able to give some input into what he thinks of it.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	The EVS is like $400 cheaper so I wouldn't think it is on par with the Leatt and Alpinestars Bionic. Of course not everyone can spend $600 - $700 on a neck brace so the EVS at $169 is a great option for everyone else.|`|qK1w972yaa	The EVS looks to be a good one..We noticed with the Leatt when wearing it in a race it would float around a bit while flying off jumps and landing. With the EVS its strapped on and can not move at all..I can't say one is better then the other because there is no real way to test that..I have a A level Friend that broke his neck with a Leatt on..But he could have been dead with out it...who knows. One thing is for sure..Don't race a dirt bike without one...Pretty small investment for what could change your life forever...We bought our EVS neck brace on e-bay NEW for $118|`|JtoXWCaRaa	Definitely the Leatt Brace! I got myself one and it is my new best friend.. =] I don't ride without it anymore.   ...the Alpinestars Bionic Neck Support may also work just as well but I've never even tried it on.|`|8bJMtiukaa	Definatly the Leatt Neckbrace. It was designed my Chris Leatt after he sustained 3 broken vertebrae in a crash in south africa. It has straps and is fully adjustable.......fully. The sternum plate, the back piece, all can be adjusted to fit your needs.......cant put a price on safty. I have the Pro Leatt and I wont ever get anything else.

The last time the Eagles had a receiver reliable enough, they went to the superbowl. That was T.O. T.J. is more suitable for the eagles offense, and would be a good compliment to Brian Westbrook.

I think it was on maxboxing.com where they said Both Mosley and Margarito got the same amount.  Usually when the fight goes to a purse bid is when the challenger receives less than the Champion but since this fight was a guaranteed box office winner there was no need for that so Mosley and Margrito got the fifty fifty split.|`|jHqV6yUxaa	The fight was in the Staples Center in CALIFORNIA.. Even though it is Mosley's town, Margarito got Arum the money. There were just too many Mexican boxing fans that wanted to see Margarito fight. I bet that over 80% of the people attending the event went to see Margarito.     And Mosley has never been a big attraction.|`|6m4ANEZGaa	FANTASTIC QUESTION!!! Man it annoys me when idiots answer questions when they know nothing about it!!!  Yeah Margarito was the belt holder but that is not the soul reason he gets paid more. Mosleys last fight was a big flop on the gate and Margarito puts more butts on seats and heads in front of pay per view!!  In saying this Mosley is now a hot item after the way he destroyed him.    Same thing for Pacman vs Hatton. Hatton demanded 50% even though Pacman is champ and rated pound for pound the best. The fact is Hattons supporters will come in droves and buy TV all day where as Pacmans supporters all huddle around the one TV in the main street! Again BUTTS ON SEATS and TV sells will always dictate purses. Money talks man.    Everyone just jumps the gun and thinks just because a guy is champion he gets a big majority.

kQSSz2X2aa	Let's start off with the difference between a sniper and a regular Mosin Nagant.  Snipers will usually have 3 little filled in holes on them. This was where the scopes were mounted. The Soviets couldn't afford the upkeep on the optics, so they got filled in. A sniper is just the most accurate rifle chosen out of a handful of others. They are a lot more expensive than the regular ones because of their historical value.  A regular Mosin Nagant comes on multiple flavors. The Finnish models are said to be the best, but they're all fine guns. They're dirt cheap too.   Most gun shops will carry a few of them. They are also plentiful at gin shows. You'll have to get one used though. They're lots of fun and will put up with almost any use and abuse you give to them.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	You can get an original here: http://www.rguns.net/rifles/rifles-bolt....    Don't be fooled by fakes, you see dozens of infantry rifles with repro scopes slapped on.     Find an FFL (Federal Firearms Licensee) near you and have them order it, then sell it to you.     Thats the best way to get an actual M91/30 PU.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	JGsales.com has snipers. Thing is they cost about 4-6 times more than a regular mosin.|`|e20ea1a3352e7d0bf5b5005b71182ae4aa	mosin nagants can be purchased for 90 -150 bucks at a lot of gun stores. they are no longer produced you will have to buy a used gun. most of the rifles available are fixer uppers. to make it a "sniper" rifle will require work, time, money, and expertise. good luck|`|vea6mqPZaa	Get you local dealer to contact CAI and get a quote    They are the company that imports them|`|fUDlbOP0aa	you CAN buy a sniper Mosin Nagant for around $500, or just buy a cheap Mosin Nagant 91/30, a scope mount, sniper rifle bolt, and cheap scope. That set up is way less than $500. In fact doable for around $200.    monitor the price of the Mosin Nagant 91/30 at the nearest Big 5 sporting goods. when its under $100, buy it. wait for the next gunshow, which will be at Glendale (near los angels), Costa Mesa, or Del Mar (about 100 miles south north of San Diego). At gun shows you'll find someone selling MN scope mount and bolts. buy one of each for the 91/30 and mount them on. there's a bunch of local gunsmiths if you need help mounting those.    alternatively buy it online at j&g sales or similar store. it'll come with a PU scope correct for the period.|`|3NQR75zraa	palyin call of duty much?  lol lol lol lol lol lol|`|mqalvNWfaa	Any ' sniper ' mosin that you see from any online dealer other than Rguns.com is a fake.

p9RS2Wh6aa	You will have a lot of open options on building your own pond.  First thing I would be checking is the cost of a bulldozer per hr.  Pick a good location that has natural drainage into where you want to build it.  I have 2 ponds on my property.  Depending on what part of the country you live in and how bad the winters get will depend on how deep you make it.  I live in S. Central Ky and both mine are 14' deep at the dams, & 1/2 ac. each.  Get in touch with your state fish and game department and see what they suggest, some states will help you out for free.  But beware of any federal grants to get one built, they will TELL you where you are going to build it and how. I know this from experience.   Also check around and see if someone in your area is experienced at building ponds.  Building a dam correctly takes knowledge and know how.   Adding structure (trees, rocks, etc.) is kinda up to you.  Here are some links you might find helpful.  http://www.bassresource.com/fish_biology...  http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/...  http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/sum...    Good Luck and have fun|`|ICGQ9EBcaa	Check out some books and videos from B.A.S.S. founder Ray Scott who has designed some of the most productive ponds and small lakes in the country. Bill Dance also has some good views on the subject as well. From what I have read crappie and productive bass ponds don't mix. Crappie can spawn multiple times a season and once they reach a certain size bass won't eat them so stick to bluegill and minnows to cut down on feeding competition.|`|MU841Iueaa	One essential feature should be a deep hole for the bass to have as a sanctuary in unstable weather.  Fish naturally seek deeper water when weather changes and it would provide a healthier environment to ensure longevity.  My ideal pond would have some nice big boulder strategically placed as well.  Good luck!|`|KJWxqQHiaa	1.) Got any ideas? I just want to know the basics.    For bass, you need lots of cover & lots of bait fish.  With those bass you're stocking, also stock bluegills, shad, and chub minnows. That will make those bass really happy. And, you need lots of cover, trees, branches, stumps, etc. They love cover. Hey, if you want to, also bring Crappie and Channel Catfish into you're pond, that would bring a lot of life to it. (Don't overpopulate w/ minnows, shad, bluegill, they will terrorize a perfectly good pond.)    Hope i helped ya out.      EDIT : The crappie would be for fishing. Why do most hot bass fishing spots also have great crappie fishing? I don't know but, it seems to work. Throw some crappie in, it won't hurt. Plus, they are the prettiest fish of any species (And taste like heaven ... ummm)|`|fVcYkX2Faa	mebey some fallen wood in the water

3DnX9NmAaa	If I'm not mistaken, Nak Muay (Muay Thai practitioner) kick banana trees, not bamboo. Bamboo trees are relatively soft and will condition the bones instead of hurting them and weakening them.    That's just one way of conditioning. Many Nak Muay tap their shins and elbows lightly with a stick and roll a stick along their shin to condition them.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	try a heavy bag. after a while of kicking it replace the inside with more sand to make it more dense.    edit i missed the part where you said bamboo. its a softer wood then that, bujinkan ninja is right its a banana tree.  and you need to be careful with rolling pins they can cause shin splints.

7dJvSe2Raa	Graeme Smith was always going to be ready for the first test against Aus in SA according to all reports over here.  I saw him on a tv show other night and he said everything was going well and he most likely gonna play the first game unless something else happens from now till then.    I think Smith is a huge player in our test side being our most experienced opener.  His leadership is invaluable especially at test level.  He has an influence on both his change room and opposition changes room with his presence.  So I think him playing will be a huge boost to our test team and keep the momentum from Aus going into this series.    EDIT: he has made himself available for pro 20 semi finals next week if his team cobras make them so he is ready to play ahead of schedule.|`|AA11088802	:) ponting should be worry|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	if he plays australia would get hard time|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	I hope he recovers soon.|`|k2y36hPkaa	Awesome stuff.

Having Smith back in the side, is going to be really handy for the Proteas. He played a huge part in South Africa's test series win against Australia, and he'll be carrying that boost in the home series against them too. One thing is there for sure, Smith will be playing a huge role in this series if he is declared fit. And if he somehow manages to get back in the SA line-up, then thats going to be simply great for South Africa.
OHs8yJiOaa	Any Oakley lens with iridium in the name is mirrored to some degree.    However, some mirrors are stronger than others. Usually the lower the light transmission level, the stronger the mirror. Mirrors seem to be stronger with polarized variants, too, but the polarized versions of a lens tend to drop the light transmission level, too.    The lowest light transmission levels are about 9-10%. Most people remain happy with the mirrors up to about 15% transmission. Above that and though there remains somewhat of a mirror, people can usually start seeing your eyes.    The blue iridium lens has a transmission level of 30%. I've only used it with the Radars, but the effect should be about the same. There's some mirror present but the eyes are pretty apparent. I suppose with enough outdoor glare and no backlighting with the A-Frame, the mirror effect may be stronger.    For the A-Frame lenses, Oakley actually does a pretty good job on their website of simulating the strength of the mirror. If you click on each of the lenses at their website (see below) and look at the enlargement, you can see the frame through the lens to varying degrees, roughly equivalent to what would happen in real life.    The blue iridium may not be as transparent as the non-iridium persimmon or G30, for example, but it's nowhere near the black iridium or fire iridium....    I'd personally tend to expect polarized lenses of great benefit for a snow goggle, and that the VR28 polarized may be quite good functionally. I'm not expert with the Oakley snow goggles and their uses, however, just the regular sunglass lenses (in which case the VR28 polarized is a darn nice functional lens).

That said, you still have a few inches to grow. If you can soften your hands a bit, then you would make a very good small forward. Right now, though, you are definitely an undersized power forward, and I guess you can pop out for an unexpected spot. Work on your handling, though, you have a lot of SF potential.|`|A93KIkWTaa	you can be a bit of a point-forward because of your shooting... but i also need to kno how old you are...|`|VQvB9AAiaa	it depends on your age, if you're 11-13 yrs old, i suggest you play sf or sg and occassionally, pf. if you're 14-above yrs old, i suggest you start practicing your ball handling as you will be too small to play pf at this time. the average height of an sf or pf would already be at 6'0 - 6'5. im not saying that im an expert at basketball but this is based on my experience being a player at a good school. but please keep in mind that i am in the philippines so this may depend on where you are currently playing in. i am 13 yrs old, 5'11 and i currently play pf or c but i plan on improving on my speed and ball handling and penetration skills so that i will be able to become an all-around player. you can also do what i am doing if you want to so that you will also be able to play more positions. hope this helps. :)|`|z6CBWSnFaa	well, if u big and bulky, be a center. u can box out and rebound without ball handling. :p|`|My7kop6Naa	you sound like you suck....|`|iEmQiqOaaa	none. at 5'7 your too small at small forward nor power forward and center. at shooting guard and point guard you has to be good in ball handling and know how to penetrate.

In the past, there was a 15-over period at the start of an innings when only two fielders were allowed outside the 30-yard circle. This meant that attacking batsmen were likely to score runs quickly in the first 15 overs, because they were able to play aggressive shots likely to result in a boundary at a lower risk of being caught out, but would become more watchful after the end of the spell.  In an effort to keep the game more exciting during the middle overs, this rule was amended to apply not only to the first 10 overs of every innings, but also in two blocks of five overs, Powerplays, which will be used at the discretion of the fielding captain.      The first ten overs in an innings are defined as Powerplay One. The fielding restrictions during this period are exactly the same as per the old ODI rules with only two players being allowed to stand outside the 30-yard circle and two fielders required to be placed in close catching position.  The first block of five overs chosen at the discretion of the relevant captain (as described below) is defined as Powerplay Two. The captain has to decide at which point he wishes to implement this rule. He can only implement it at the beginning of an over, provided he informs the umpire. Again, only two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. However there is no mandatory number of close catchers during this power play.  The second block of five overs, with identical parameters to Powerplay Two, is defined as Powerplay Three.  When the relevant side's captain informs the umpire that he wishes to enact a powerplay, the official will signal so by moving his arm in a circular motion.  Since October 1st 2007, the fielding captain now has the choice of making either the second or the third powerplay a "three fieldsmen" powerplay where they are allowed to station one extra man outside the this fielding restriction area. In 2008, the rules were further amended to allow the captain to post three fielders in the outfield during both the second and third powerplays.  Should the fielding captain choose not to exercise his discretion, the remaining powerplays automatically commence at the latest available point in the innings (i.e. at the start of the 41st and 46th overs in an uninterrupted innings). Power play at the final overs would mean that the batting side has greater opportunity to score runs as only three men would be out of the thirty yard circle .  When the Powerplay rule was first introduced, the decision regarding when Powerplays Two and Three was at the discretion of the captain of the fielding team.  Since October 2008 (starting from the one-day series between New Zealand and Bangladesh) rules have been changed. Now the batting team decides when to introduce either the second or the third Powerplay during their innings.|`|LmSzaMIiaa	1st Powerplay 1-10 and ther e should be one man outside the circle.  2nd Powerplay 11-15 there can be 3 men out side the circle.  New rule another 5 overs can be selected by batting team and is known as batting powerplay in which there will be 3 men outside the circle.|`|APvRSsGbaa	Power play is split into 3 halves,   The first power play is for the first 10 overs and only 2 fileders can stand outside the thirty yard circle.     The next 2 power plays are 5 overs each, and can be decided anytime by the fielding captain. The fielding restrictions would again come into consideration during these 2 powerplays|`|KeCLtvpGaa	the power play as before it was but only thing is that power play 3 has given for to the batting fever when, ever they want they can take after the 15 overs
6msce8FZaa	Buy a new tent...they are fairly cheap anymore and will protect you better in the long run. Otherwise, buy a cot so your off the ground. Make sure to dig a small trench around the tent and pitch it on a slight incline with the door facing downhill-the rain will go around and away from the tent.|`|NrSs1lJgaa	get a new tent or maybe just remember that it is camping and if you get wet u get wet|`|AA11404742	There used to be spray-on fabric waterproofers. "Camp Dry" was one of them, but there are others.  I don't know how well it would work on a canvas tent, though.  The ad in the link below says it can be used on tents, but you're asking it to do a lot in this instance.  For the price, though, it's worth a try.  Hang the tent someplace where it can get VERY dry first, and then spray it with several coats, and see what you get.    Another option might be to find a canvas repair shop, awning maker, sailmaker, or someplace that can sew heavy fabric.  Ask them if they can replace the bottom of the tent with something durable, but more waterproof.  This will cost you more, but you'll probably be able to count on getting a dry night's sleep.|`|m1V5ws73aa	No, neither waterproofing the tent floor nor using a ground cloth (tarp) underneath will prevent leaking, but it helps to do these as well as a few other things:  Pitch your tent on high ground so that any water will drain away from it, and use a tarp that just fits the shape of the tent floor, either getting a ground cloth that is made to fit that tent model, trimming the edges by hand, or tucking the edges under the tent.  Any part of the tarp that sticks out on the sides will only gather water and guide it under the tent floor.  Also, get your sleeping bag off the tent floor by using either a cot or an air mattress.

Kobe will have to really focus on defense again or something to get the edge back.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	It has to be a trip dub, thats not taking anything away from the Black Mumba.

That's a no brainer! Every basketball expert would agree that Lebron definitely had a better game. I could concede that Kobe has a better scoring game but, Lebron top Kobe w/ a better all around game! Kobe was just concerned on scoring the whole night on that game. While Lebron's play was still multi-dimensional. If you would factor in the assists Lebron made and multiply that 2 pts then, it sum up to 72 pts againts Kobe's 67! Do you all understand now? I suppose those people who still believe Kobe has a better game are ignorant of true team game of basketball. I would take Lebron's game anytime!    Heck, even Jordan can score 61 pts any given night but, he won't have 0 rebounds and lesser assists in a game unlike Kobe. So, stop hattin you Kobe lovers! Don't be blinded anymore! Time to realize that we are now living in James World of Basketball! Lebron 4 MVP '09!|`|iPlFG1Ojaa	Bron Bron was just flat out beastin kobe had 61 but like 1dime and no rebounds yea he went 20-20 form the stripe but still lebron used more of a team effort|`|3QuZeCB4aa	LeBron what else. Team player that's what it's all about! Hear that Kobe fans? TEAM PLAYER!|`|jsxaH92uaa	Lebrons 52pt Triple-Double was more impressive than Kobe's 61pt performance.    BUT    People dont seem to realize that Kobe scored 61pts in just 36 MINUTES. He pretty much sat down a whole quarter. If kobe played the 44 minutes that Lebron did, he would have probably dropped 70+ pts in MSG in the pace that he was going.    Yah Lebrons triple double was very impressive, but dont count out Kobe's brilliance as well. Overall, both were spectacular in MSG, and both will be remembered for their performances.

To start buy rub on waxes that you can apply the night before you go. Let the guys in the shop do hot waxes. To know when look at your base. Think of it as your skin. If it looks lighter in color and dry near the edges or between the bindings then get a hot wax. I do this every 4-5 days of riding. And I use a rub on inbetween. For now use an all-temp wax that is inexpensive. $10.00 U.S. there are expensive waxes out there and it is not needed yet. You will know when. You can buy an iron and brushes and do it yourself but you will need close instruction as you may damage your board. Get asubscription to a snow magazine or make friends with someone in a board shop to get tips. Your ride solace doesnt need to be waxed that often. The base material is softer and holds wax longer than the high end expensive boards. The 400 dollar plus boards have a harder base and the wax burns off quicker, These need to be waxed almost twice as often. Now all of these factors depend on snow condition, what and where you are riding, and how long each time. Your board doesnt need wax right now but remember...the wax is like skin. It will tell you when.|`|JFUjxdmDaa	1st of all, all brand new snowboards come with a factory wax on them so no u dident have to wax it before you go you should at least wax ur snowboard every 3-4 rides not like up the ski lift down i mean full days like u use it a lot if u dont use it a lot wax it every 6-7 rides.2nd there are different types of waxes some are spray on some are rub on some are melt on i suggest u use the melt on spray only last 1-2 days maybe rub on is every 2 slopes you hit, rub on is used for racing the melt on gets in all the cracks of ur snowboard making it better.3rd u should always loosen ur bindings before using hot wax so it doesent leave those holes, well i hope this helped

lWNc9NRfaa	It really depends on the team, but there are usually only a few hundred at most. Here at Dallas, we have a section at the northeast corner of the stadium that usually has a fairly large group of away fans. When we play Colorado or Houston, there are a lot more.  In non league games, it is a different story. We have a lot of games against teams from Mexico here and I have been to a few where there might have been more away fans than there were for FC Dallas. Those teams have a lot of fans here and they really get involved in the game.|`|FWRcz5VGaa	usually the majority of the fans are for the home team however in big games there are away fans but yes there is a singing and an atmosphere.

LUnscegvaa	Aikido is an excellent choice.    But there is a lot of break falling involved if you can get past the stage of accepting/taking them then you are on your way,same applys to Japanese jiu-jitsu,judo and Bjj.    Good luck and Best wishes :)***|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	Aikido will help, and you already recognize that it's not going to be overnight.  Just don't tell anyone you're taking it, because then they'll want to see what you know, which will be disastrous at first.  Once you've developed some proficiency, you'll have the option of severely hurting one or two of these clowns with a relatively small amount of motion/effort, and leave them wondering how you did that.  This might buy you some respect and some space.|`|73wpIlgnaa	Aikido will help but it really isn't going to help with what you want.  learn something with aggressiveness, but have control.  subduing one with a lock could scare the others.    And by the way, ALL arts are long term arts.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Judo is better, and there are more schools out there. Why do you think they thought this to special forces.|`|gBO908P6aa	Aikido is great to learn and contrary to what someone said here, Aikido does use atemi or strikes as a means to set up techniques as well as techniques to deal with them.  It's a defensive style that seeks to preserve the attacker and neutralize the attack, probably one of the more humane styles around.   It's also geared for more than one attacker as well.  The flipside, as you already know, is it takes time and dedication to practice and perfect it because it's much more complex than simply punching the daylights out of someone.  That, anybody can do.  To restrain, control and subdue with little bloodshed and the utmost compassion, that's the pinnacle of martial arts.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Not so much for self defense.  Aki jujitsu is better, but even that takes a really long time to learn.    Here are some arts I would recommend for self defense purposes:    1) Krav Maga - best street defense art.  2) Jujstu.  Brazilian is good, but if you have multiple opponents maybe not so much.  Japanses jujitsu might work out better for you.  3) Judo.  Nothing like being thrown to the ground at 35mph to correct someone's attitude.    4) Kenpo Karate - Good, detailed karate system.  Very self defense oriented except for the kata.  5) Jeet Kune Do - Hard to find, but Bruce Lee's concepts are geared for fighting.  6) Muay Thai - tough, brutal striking system.  7) Western Boxing - simple and effective.  The conditioning alone will help you.  8) wrestling: if you're old enough for the wrestling team, this is awesome in a brawl.  If a guy is pinned, he can't beat you up.  Seriously.  This is one of the top ten martial arts in the world.  9) Mixed Martial Arts - all the best elements of wrestling, judo, and kickboxing.  Very tough, very effective.  You'd be a better fighter after 6 months of MMA than after six years of aikido.      Arts aren't in any particular order.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|vi177FW2aa	"Shaolin Chaun'Fa" with United Studios of Self Defense.|`|15FlstmHaa	Aikido is a good choice, but it's hard to find a good place to learn because Aikido doesnt have strikes and offense it's more defending yourself so it's hard to find a place with someone who HAS strikes and offense that you can defend yourself agaisnt.    btw, i study Juijitsu, Muay Thai, Okinawan Kenpo, and Wrestling and that's turned out to be a really good combo for me.|`|1AgD0dsBaa	For Self defense to start off, with multiple opponents you should see if you can find a Wing Chun School, Its a very practical style that involves much balance and multiple fighting tiring. Aikido will take a few years just to learn. Or you could  learn Kick Boxing, sometimes when bullies try to bull rush you, you will have no choice but to sustain pain on your self and them. Its always better to talk your way out of a fight.     Cali  Tae Kwon Do  Traditonal Chinese Kung Fu  Karate  Mui Thai  In these schools find an orginal master of that Ethnic Back ground for good support.  Or teachers who still practice with the origianl ethnic group..     35 yrs Aiki-Jutitsu, Instructor and Practitioner  33 yrs Aikido, Instructor and Practitioner  21 years- Chinese Forms-Instructor and Practitioner|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Based on what you are looking for - self defense that leaves you the option of not seriously injuring your opponent - Aikido would be great.  We tend to have a lot of bouncers and cops in our school, who learn it for the very same reason.  Unlike many people, they have actually used the moves regularly at work.  Even my uncle, whose primary arts are Jeet Kune Do and Taekwondo, uses Aikido when bouncing.  He has used it to safely bounce a 70 year old drunk man (without injury) - and effectively bounce people of all ages and sizes.    Aikido sometimes has a bad reputation among other artists who have seen crappy Aikido and assume that it is what it is.  It's sort of like watching Rex Kwon Do (from Napoleon Dynamite) and assuming that all martial arts are crap.  Of course, you probably wouldn't want to train in Rex Kwon Do at all - so take your time and visit as many dojo's that you can and find the one that challenges you and that you can respect.  Only by visiting multiple schools can you really get a sense of what's different at each, and make an educated decision.  I can highly recommend any Wadokai school (if you're on the east coast).  Others may also be quite good.|`|LFLflsWFaa	This martial arts journey is YOUR journey--but I'm willing to put in my opinion since you asked :) .    Aikido is a very compassionate art. You'll learn how to manipulate your Ki/Chi, learn how to use bokken/bo staff, and at your best--try not to hurt anyone, only to disarm them.     When you go to this Aikido school, practice, practice, practice. Not only in the school, but outside. Then make your own sense of style. Watch some clips from Youtube to add to your Aikido, then practice, practice, and practice.    You have a good heart, you can do it. That's pretty much what it takes.|`|30FwE9qGaa	Any martial art is a good start.  It is important to believe in what you are training in.  Visit some schools in your area, watch the teachers and more importantly watch the students.  If their attitude is that in which you wish to be, this school may be a good start.  Watch for others who say "their" style is the "best".  Often that person has limited training and is spiritually lost.  I have trained in several martial arts, all of which were great.  However, as a student and a teacher of Aikido and a police officer who has used Aikido in real world scenarios, would agree that Aikido may be the way to go if you wish to remain "non-violent".  Good luck.|`|pwFRFUdvaa	Yes Aikido is a very good choice, very. Because you don't really want to kick them in the face to tell them to stop, like taekwondo or kickboxing. Lol so yeah, aikido is good enough.|`|fRosDAZEaa	The problems aikido will solve for you aren't the ones you are experiencing at school now.  Don't dismiss aikido, but consider something else for immediate self defense/staying alive.  Track and field for example.  You should be able to out run most of your assailants after a season of that.  Jeet Kune Do or Kajukenbo are some pretty good classes to take for quick applicability, but know the law in your area.  Above all else, stay out of jail.

So as long as the Tae guy keeps the other at distance/bay, he'd eventually kick him hard enough to win an all out brawl.  But if the Muay gets in a few strong kicks, its likely to be over faster for the Tae guy.  If they brawled with just fists for a while, I'd give it straight up to the Muay guy.  Grappling is hard to say, maybe Thai guy again would be tougher to flip.  That is putting your question in a context of an all out brawl with no rules and no one ends up "fouling or cheating" until there is a winner.|`|812xWV0naa	anyones game to be honest - it doesnt depend on the level but on the individual.    i practice Wing Chun kung fu- from my point of view it's the best martial art, still i could be knocked down by muay tai!

Korean Arts are focused on strength and kicking. Its very physical and there are a lot of good instructors from Korea in every area. Their competitive system is based on points, so you will get a good work out every time. Most instructors also teach Hopkido- Ground and gouging techniques to complement the Tae Kwondo.     Mui Thai is a great art as well tis based on open form fighting with knees and shins elbows. This school is deadly and condition the body for intense punishment. This is hard, because there are certian training techniques to harden your shins for the brutal training involved to be a muy thai fighter. Most Americans really don't train properly with in the Muy Thai system so be alarmed as you search. Banana Tree and rolling the blood cloth build up is key to not dieing from a stroke.

(Bob A) You need to spend a couple hundred more and although you can find deals on Craigslist, this is not one of them! Go find a Local bike shop and let them fit you properly to a bike that they recommend for your weight and size....!!!! Yes you will spend more $ but if you want to get fit on a bike then you want one you do not have to push. Stay away from this Bike shaped object please!!! I would not wish this BSO on my worst enemy and looking at the pictures, unless you know how to rebuild this BSO then please avoid it and not to mention the ad just looks shady''.....|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You don't want that bike, it's a cheap one made for Walmart and other department stores.  The shocks on that bike are going to eat up any energy that you put into pedaling.  For your weight you want to look at a good hardtail bike like the Kona Hoss.   You don't want to buy any bike that is sold in department or sports stores.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	No, this is one of the worst bikes for what your needs are. They are selling a junky department store bike at pretty much full retail price, and I can't even figure out what the size of the frame is (26" is a standard size for the wheel, not the frame, I've yet to see a 26" frame for a giant guy)    This bike itself is very heavy, and you won't enjoy the riding as much if you get a decent bike. The cheap dual-suspension makes the bike even slower by sapping the pedaling force. Not mentioning department bikes such as this would break down after about 50 miles riding.    Regarding your weight, all decent bikes are built to support your weight and more. Even the skinny road bikes can support your weight. What I would recommend you to do is go to a bike shop and ask questions, and research on what type of bike that suits you.|`|oPbLcfKoaa	No, it is not a good choice. Let me explain.... this is a bit of a long explanation...    Outside of being a department store bike that are available new for not much more than the seller is asking there are other important reasons:    1) A bicycle with front and/or rear suspension such as the one you are looking at is designed for people 140 to 170 pounds. A 300 pound person would flatten the springs and cause great stresses on the pivots which would seriously shorten the life of the bike;    2) The drivetrain (gears and such) will not handle the extra torque a person of that girth might place on them;    3) The bike is heavy in weight but all the components are light-duty which will cause constant maintenance, in turn discouraging the rider from using the bike. Upgrades and repairs would easily cost more than the bike.    So, what would a clydesdale (an affectionate name for heavy riders) do?    I suggest that the focus be placed on a bike, similar to a Diamondback Response ($350 range) that can be had used for $150 or so, maybe a bit more. Ultimately, you want a bike that has NO rear suspension and a more durable drivetrain. Then, visit a bike shop and have the front suspension fork replaced with a rigid one (keep in mind the weight limits and the fact that suspension isn't for comfort, it is to keep the wheel on the ground for better handling). Have the wheels retensioned too. All this should cost a total of about $250.00 if you can find a suitable used bike. Very well worth it.    As the rider starts to lose weight and reaches the 180-200 pound range then the front shock can be reinstalled but the springs may have to be upgraded to handle the extra weight.    Now, the price may seem steep but in reality it is just a few days pay, and far less than a treadmill or other item, plus you get to enjoy the Great Outdoors.

Go for the biggest they have and duct  tape that mother to your wall or whatever you're planning on doing with it.    If you are planning on playing with it be advised that any sword, wall hanger or not, is not a toy. If you're truly interested look into some of the many sword arts available and get a real teacher.

Safety first.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Any height //while holding the sword at your side pointing down the tip should not extend past your ankle bone.The wakasashi or companion sword should not extend past the center of the shin bone but some leeway is allowed there.    These measurements are for the samurai personal every day sword an actual sword for the battle field could be somewhat longer but on the battle field quick draw skills are not really required as blades are already drawn before battle is joined.

h7GtCCC7aa	Hard to answer this one without it taking a few hours but...    Money IS a problem in this day and age because in Football around the globe, money talks.     Players are mercenaries, a large percentage are in it for what they can get.... gone are the days when a club side is made up of guys who grew up supporting them, live within 10 mins of the ground and show loyalty by sticking with their side for years.    In terms of youth development, it is getting harder and harder these days to get kids to stick in with the football, even the ones that aren't over weight with all the fast foods, drinking/smoking/drugs in their teens... you have the problem of all the other 'activities' to do in your spare time, other sports are easier and more assessable to participate in, then there is the other killer, the internet and games consoles, why do they want to run around in the freezing cold when they can play their pals on the X Box from their own room!    I'm not ancient and when I was at school, loads of us played football at lunchtime, after school, at night, weekends..... these days the places we played are still there, just no one is there....    Technology is killing the game, we are probably no worse than most modern Countries but the fact we have such a small population, it shows more.    I don't even know what I am going on about, I'm on auto pilot...What was the question again? Anyway, no sleep for 2 days, I was going to try and last until tonight but I'm away to bed, good evening|`|nH4TOhGVaa	lol yes but the reason for buying over the hill and over rated players was down to not having enough cash to buy decent players so lets hope we as the s.p.l. start giving youth a chance.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	There's not enough money in Scotland right now for anything let alone football.

Scottish Football isn't that bad really, Its the second strongest league in the UK, I do believe that the Old Firm have gone marginally backwards over the last decade but the quality outwith the big two has certainly increased.

It really is best to try stuff on first as well rather than just buying off the Internet.  You don't want to end up with jackets you can't move about in.

IN FACT, PLAYBOY IS PRETTY TASTEFUL WHEN COMPARED TO MAGAZINES LIKE HUSTLER AND PENTHOUSE. THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE TO POSE IN MAGS LIKE MAXIM AS WELL, BUT MAXIM IS MORE LIKE COSMO FOR MEN.

Ar5VHDiBaa	Barry Bonds breaking the HR record killed my dog|`|UQYurvnYaa	they never would have made such a big deal out of the steroids thing|`|KhBmlaefaa	Records are made to be broken. Only silly people are complaining about it. What Bonds did doesn't take away from what Aaron did, and what Aaron did doesn't take away from what Babe did. All different Era's and all greats of their Era.|`|POriIGJtaa	If he hadn't broke the record nobody would care.  Did he cheat or just get around the rules?  Steroids weren't always against baseballs rules|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Roger Clemons didn't break any records, and neither did Bic Mac, but both have had similar talks about them. So I don't think it would have mattered.|`|obPSaYf3aa	The next player in line with a chance to break Henry Aaron's HR record, if Barry Bonds never was a star, would then receive the abuse and false allegations and be MLB's scapegoat.  Whomever would break Henry's record would have syringes thrown at him, have fans make up names and threats and would not care what went on other than the game of baseball.    Even though Barry has positive test results showing steroids and PED's in his system back then, what scientific proof is there to prove that using them helped hit HR's at an alarming rate when he's been doing it before he took PED's? How about the other 100's of professional athletes in MLB that also "used"?     What about the times every professional athlete (Barry included) with a traumatic injury that receives prescribed steroidal applications and injections to prevent tissue swelling and to repair the injuries much quicker? Are asthmatics and people suffering inflammation from infections considered bad people in society just because they have steroids in their system? Are you going to condemn or call the cops on that person taking a whiff from their steroid laden asthma pump?????    What about Henry Aaron's documented usage of amphetamines (speed) while chasing George Herman Ruth's HR record? People too young to know never knew that fact..... Do you see what cops do to people using, caught with or manufacturing amphetamines?    I believe that Barry Bonds will receive a guilty verdict, but will not have to spend any jail time. He will keep his records and no asterisks will be placed. He will just be used as an example (currently used as a scapegoat) for other professional athletes not to use PED's.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	If Barry Bonds never broke the all time homerun record then Hank Aaron would still be the undisputed homerun champ.    The talk would still be going on.  Roger Clemens didn't break any records and look at all of the talk going on about him.  Same with McGwire, Sosa, Palmeiro, etc.|`|GyJqMWdUaa	If he didn't break the record, I honestly think no one would care.  It's the fact that he has one of the most prolific records in sports history that makes this case bigger than it should be.   Palmeiro didn't break the record and people couldn't care less about his steroid use.|`|3mZyMnjfaa	he didn't he cheated    cant wait till a-rod breaks it though then baseball wont have a cheater on top|`|gCerCaOSaa	As a fan, i would be more pleased, knowing all this info that is coming out, he knew he failed the tests but continued to play just to break the record.  I hope A-rod or pujols breaks the record in their careers, they seem like honest men

Watching cricket on tv is fun too, but one must experience watching a match in the stadium atleast once.|`|k2y36hPkaa	Yes I have. I have been lucky enough to have gone to quite a few international matches and the odd domestic games. The experience is unbelievable especially if you go to a game that has a full capacity staduim!|`|RGxMkT0zaa	I'd love to be in such a stadium like Eden gardens where the crowd roars with every Indian stroke and wickets they take.|`|bettx8AYaa	why you wanting clos view of every balls? and replay aslo?|`|ocPlxCIeaa	Never in a stadium,  But I feel watching on TV is much better because of the replays, stats, h.eye etc...    Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4wPbaVzzaa	Yup. It is a amazing experience. You do hear the commentary. But watching in TV is the best as you can see replays and relax easily|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Yeah, i 've!!! And i would always prefer to watch a match in stadium than seeing it on tv! Everyone just goes crazy there....the cheering....the noise - it's crazy over there, especially when u r in eden garden!!!|`|FNs7MZF4aa	No but passed out of the stadium during live matches and heard the cheers and noise from the crowd.|`|gbFwoOtTaa	yes i have, but i would say that watching it on tv is better, although experiencing the atmosphere is amazing. u should try it out.  i dont think u hear commentary through the speakers on every ball, but u do get it occasionally. u do get to see the run graphs on the big screen and the scorecard is always visible.|`|sgmv6AXnaa	hahaha! hell no u shud be in a match in order to feel da adrenaline pumpin expireince its awsome the crowd nd da view aint dat bad u rlly shud go 2 1 nd c i luv it. TV is nthin comparing to it (u do hear da commenttry)|`|XBC4MC0laa	yes i have seen almost most of the matches played in my city  in stadium the disadvantage is that you cannot hear the players and watch the giant screen monitor for score every time the commentary will not be heard loudly because of the shouting crowd you are right watching on tv is better than watching it on stadium|`|AA0L7X2Oaa	only in park|`|4VoQduaZaa	We do not get to watch so many games in India .. the reason being there are so many places where the matches are held that your place  probably gets one game per season. And getting tickets to that game every year in a city like Mumbai is almost next to impossible.     I have watched plenty of games. But it has been some time now since I am away from my country. The atmosphere is all that makes it an amazing experience. Watching Sachin blast his way against Warne and McGrath in WC'96 or Kumble running through the SA line-up in Titan Cup finals or the 5 amazing catches (3 of them were out of the world) by Jonty in the Hero Cup against WI .. these are the moments you never want to forget. And then you also remember Flintoff taking his shirt off after series-leveling win. But all my experiences are related to only two stadiums .. Wankhede and Brabourne. I wish to be at Eden Gardens or MCG some day. If the crowd gets involved, even a Ranji match is worth watching.|`|eLAiGdxhaa	well i recently went to a match and i at first thought that that it would be better on tv (for reasons such as replays, commentary etc etc.) but when you get there and the first wicket is taken or the first 6 is hit, the crowds roar just seems to get into your veins and you will go back time and time again|`|zJGtChERaa	ya|`|nxjYaHMGaa	yes....  Ind Vs Aus atc ochin..last year..|`|AJJMyGvcaa	i have witnessed two matches at chennai ...1 st was asia XI vs africa XI wre dhoni n jayawardene scored centuries n it ws a close match too..i witnessed almost 600 runs scored in a day           2 nd was the historic india -england encounter wre india chased 387 for victory in the fourth innings tre was a gr8 knowledgable crowd n i enjoyed the whole day...to me watchin sachin's century means more than hearin commentry n those graphs...! so do go n watch a match tat yr favorite team plays with a good crowd u ll enjoy it surely..
1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there    Forms exists in every martial art regardless of the style. People choose to call them technqiues but isnt that what a form is? Its just less moves? Like you have said every long massive form is only made up from individual small moves. If you take them out of the big kata and practice them in a realisitc shiken gata way then they work!     The  major problem is not with the forms themselves but the practitioners eyes in which they choose to view them. I am a big fan of imperfection in the arts because perfection doesnt exist. I also beleive that muscle memory doesnt create natural movement either. I stopped along time ago thinking that repetition creates instinctive movement!     Yet im still a traditional martial artist?    The forms are there for a reason and they need to be trained correctly. Not parrot fashion, perfect stance or with dynamic tenstion but by learning the distance, timing and flow agaisnt a real uke. Thats what the forms are there to show us but it takes experience to see this on face value!    I have nothing against the modern interpritation of forms and how they are taught to beginners because thats how everyone must start out. But making up forms is just silly as is only practicing them in line work. Parrot fashion creates lots of parrots that are incapable of moving and thinking by themselves!       Best wishes    idai|`|73wpIlgnaa	no one has a right to say that, not even bruce lee! bruce lee wasn't perfect.  he didn't even realize how much he got from kata. its that misunderstanding that robs a lot fo jeet kune do studiers of good technique because they are misquoting and misunderstanding him.  it is rare to see one (JKD students) with nice kicks.      Kata is NOT outdated.  People just don't understand its uses! this is aggravating... and I agree with BTW and Shihan J wholeheartedly.      you don't use a kata in a fight, so don't think of it that way.  you use the technqiues from kat, and the kata itself refines the techniques artfully and practically, while sparring allows you to ADAPT them to a situation and refine them further, in another way.  Golly wiz|`|LUnscegvaa	With being a former Karateka in shukokai and shotokan I loved kata training and with reading Iain Abernathy's book, recently  I've become inspired all over again after all these years as in my day the Bunkai was not explained in such detail.    So in my mind Kata is very useful if taught and explained correctly.    Best wishes :)***|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Kata isn't useless.  It teaches basic coordination, perfection of movement, balance and endurance.  This is assuming you have a good teacher.    But I would say that kata is outdated.  There are better ways to learn the martial arts.    I feel very qualified to say this.  I have a fifth degree black belt in kempo karate, and another black belt in TKD.  I've studied traditional karate as well.  I'm a stickler for correct technique, especially in stances and body mechanics.  I've won multiple kata competitions at various levels all the way up to international competition.  My students have won state, national and world championships in traditional forms, creative forms and weapons forms.      For those who shrug off competitive forms as a measure of ability, I'd have to say that in my experience, not competing certainly isn't a guarantee of success.  I know good forms from "empty" forms, and nearly all the best kata schools I know of compete.  Not all, but most.    All that being said, you can more effectively teach self defense though hard drill, pad work, sparring, grappling and technique practice.  Obviously, there was a time I taught kata extensively.  I will never do so again.  I brought MMA style training into my traditional karate / jujitsu school and it worked so much faster and so much better than kata oriented training that I can't even compare the two.  My students were more than twice as good as before, with more discipline, more coordination, better and more effective technique, and better strength and endurance.  Night and day difference.    So useless?  No.  But its like using a handsaw instead of a chainsaw to fell a tree.  There is just a better way now.  I hope you try to learn it.    EDIT: Actually, I don't teach at all right now as I am joining the army and dedicating myself to that.  But I hope to land a job teaching combatives while I'm in, once I learn the whole system, which is a lot like BJJ.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Some people say that Kata won't help you with self defense. If we say this is true (not that it is or isn't, just play along for this moment), then martial arts is all about self defense, which is false. We who are true martial artists know that MA is about the inner person, a MA is a tool not a weapon. You are the weapon.  OR if Kata does help you with self defense then it's about fighting, which is true since martial arts does focus on fighting. in order for the artist himself to recognize his responsibility to himself to train.  Kata teaches movement, Kata is literally basic movements (and since basics are required for everything in martial arts..), Kata teaches balance and timing, angle, power, speed, combinations, it helps with being fluid. Kata is definitely useful.  Also, you say "Those that don't have the patience thats fine".. martial arts is all about patience. Patience with yourself, others. Because an artist can never stop learning, an art can never really be perfected. And since it can never really be perfected, learning (and therefor the art) must go on for ever. One must have patience for forever.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	kata contains everything in your style, all the blocks, strikes, grappling etc. without kata it is no longer karate.  the problem is a lot of people that teach kata dont know the bunkai, and only teach it as a kick and punch exercise or to help stance.    the other problem is people misunderstand the bunkai and say it is one thing, and it doesn't work, when the move is something else, kata bunkai works when applied correctly.     it is still very applicable. every move that you spar with comes from kata|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	I would say kata will not help you in self defense.    Actual unnarmed techniques are such a miniscule part of self defense that it isn't even funny. Awareness of your surroundings, Common Sense, Avoiding dangerous areas or situations, and avoiding confrontation are so much more of self defense than any single unnarmed technique that it isn't even funny.    People seeking Martial Arts completely as a means of self defense are fooling themselves outright, as the vast majority of it won't help you in 99.9% of your ever day self protection, and it won't help you in 95% of what is considered "Self Defense Scenarios" now a days.    You going to throw a punch or kick at a gun wielding person seeking to rob you?    If attacked by a crazed homicidal maniac, and you are truly in fear of your life are you going to just use your hands?     Myself, despite whatever unnarmed skill I have,  if I am fear for my life I am using my gun, my knife, or whatever else I can pick up, and my "techniques" consist of hit as hard as I can with a blunt object, and stick the pointy end in as many times as I can with a pointed object.    Most unnarmed fighting techniques are good for about 1% of self defense, hell maybe even less, as I don't count fighting with drunks, or ego fueled confrontations as self defense.    Understandably I know your stances on kata. However I think that it is circular argument. For example one guy is going to say that by focussing on kata your instructor doesn't know what he is doing, you are going to say he does, etc.    Vice Versa, someone who says they used to do kata and now don't like it, you are going to say that they truly aren't doing the art, or that they didn't learn kata from an instructor who knew what they are doing, they are going to say that their instructor kicks *** etc.    Personally I have some experience with Kata. I feel that it is useful as a conditioning tool, and as a means of defining the mechanics of a technique. All techniques have to be altered from kata, or from how they are taught by each individual period. The entire Bunkai aspect of long drawn out forms is interesting to me, only because of the various interpretations each person has in them.    I see nothing wrong with kata, but I disagree with the "kata will get you there only slower" argument.    Without sparring and contact, no amount of kata will help you. You will lack timing, rythm, and the ability to see openings in defenses, and the application of the technique at full speed against a moving resisting target. However the mechanics of the block, of the strike or technique can be further and further refined in kata to make them stronger, more functional, more natural and not awkward. So that using them in sparring becomes easier, and the techniques themselves are stronger. Adapting them becomes easier because you more wholly understand the technique.    Competetive Judo players will tell you how much more they learned about throws and the art when they started doing kata, (most start at an older age, after they can no longer keep up the rigors of Shiai)  Few actually focus on it outside and find out how much it can help their shiai.  However, without the randori or shiai, sparring, or fighting, you won't have the ability to use the tools kata presents you.    You need to develop timing, and autonomous muscle memory that kicks in during fight or flight. You have seen the guys on the verge of losing win it all back with one punch that they threw automatically in reaction to a certain technique.    Not to mention the ability to actually have defense, which you will never get without someone trying to hit you and you stopping them repeatedly.    Kata helps you refine the mechanics and understanding of the technique, but it's application and muscle memory as a reflex has to be built in sparring. Otherwise you won't know which blows an upwards block truly blocks, or when you need to start it in reaction to a punch to actually block a blow, too soon or too late you are getting hit. That kind of stuff doesn't get developed in kata.    But I don't think an entire 100 step kata is necessary for that, but it is a useful way of passing on the curriculum and techniques of the art. The rest (the application of the techniques) varies from person to person as they modify them to work for them.    That is my two cents..    My words and logic are a testament of my experience.|`|v1mbL56caa	If Bruce Le meant that Kata was worthless, than why did he spend Hours practicing on the stick man? I believe he is quoted out of context frequently by those to lazy and lacking in discipline to follow Kata.  Of course Kata by itself is no good. That is why you have training partners.  Sorry I had to put my two cents in.  Thanks for all of the Bruce Lee quotes SHOOTERS. Bruce was a classically trained Martial Artiest. You can see the Wing Chun Kung Fu in his fighting style. Certainly he is correct when he implies it is foolish to be dogmatic about any particular style. What works for the short stout fighter like me may be fool hardy for a long lanky guy to try. You must learn to adapt. With that said I would compare trying to learn a formless art with trying to write without an alphabet.  Bluto is right to be  riping Mcdojos about spending hours and hours on a fancy lengthly Kata without breaking down the aplications. I think that is the focus of his answer. It is very prevalent in Taekwando. As a Taekwando instructor it  makes me sad.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	SIFU FRANK is correct .Lee was quoted out of context and misquoted by article writers who never met or knew him..He said do not deny or condemn the classical approach as you will only trap yourself in another form.    Those who don't do form kid themselves into thinking not doing form is reality based or that they are free.As LEE said that's their delusion their trap.    Further LEE sayings  "To tell the truth....I could beat anyone in the world."[citation needed]   "If I tell you I'm good, you would probably think I'm boasting. If I tell you I'm no good, you know I'm lying."[citation needed]   "Fighting is not something sought after, yet it is something that seeks you."[citation needed]   "Be formless... shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle; it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot; it becomes the teapot. Water can flow, and it can crash. Be like water, my friend..."[58]   "Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it."[59]   "The more relaxed the muscles are, the more energy can flow through the body. Using muscular tensions to try to 'do' the punch or attempting to use brute force to knock someone over will only work to opposite effect."[citation needed]   "Mere technical knowledge is only the beginning of Gung Fu. To master it, one must enter into the spirit of it."[citation needed]   "There are lots of guys around the world that are lazy. They have big fat guts. They talk about chi power and things they can do, but don't believe it."[citation needed]   "I'm not a master. I'm a student-master, meaning that I have the knowledge of a master and the expertise of a master, but I'm still learning. So I'm a student-master. I don't believe in the word 'master.' I consider the master as such when they close the casket."[citation needed]   "Do not deny the classical approach form, simply as a reaction, or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there."[60]   "Jeet Kune Do: it's just a name; don't fuss over it. There's no such thing as a style if you understand the roots of combat."[citation needed]   "Unfortunately, now in boxing people are only allowed to punch. In Judo, people are only allowed to throw. I do not despise these kinds of martial arts. What I mean is, we now find rigid forms which create differences among clans, and the world of martial art is shattered as a result."[citation needed]   "I think the high state of martial art, in application, must have no absolute form. And, to tackle pattern A with pattern B may not be absolutely correct."[citation needed]   "True observation begins when one is devoid of set patterns."[citation needed]   "The other weakness is, when clans are formed, the people of a clan will hold their kind of martial art as the only truth and do not dare to reform or improve it. Thus they are confined in their own tiny little world. Their students become machines which imitate martial art forms."[citation needed]   "Some people are tall; some are short. Some are stout; some are slim. There are various different kinds of people. If all of them learn the same martial art form, then who does it fit?"[citation needed]   "Ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. It is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky so I can show you some really fancy movement. But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself, and to express myself honestly enough; that, my friend, is very hard to do."[citation needed]     Those that do static training that is training without sparring and developing their own adaptations to make what they are being taught fit them are the people he was talking about .As he said some are short some are tall etc etc whether you do forms or not has nothing to do with it .Can you make it fit you and is your sensei wise enough to let you do it?  And LEE's comments about being formless like water have been said by both ancient and modern masters long before he said them .To go learn something and try to be formless from the beggining is useless .That's not formless that's confusion.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	This is a good question.    Kata do help in self defense. I agree that they are not outdated. The kata my sons learned was beneficial to him when he was attacked unexpectedly. He was able to block and strike without thinking about it. It was a natural reflex for him.    I am puzzled. A 5th degree black belt that i trying to join the service. That appears to odd to me. You don't join the military after a certain age. You don't get a 5 dan before a certain age. Maybe it is just me.|`|4LYasBGXaa	i'm probably the most vocal one saying that here and my experiences are that yes- iv'e seen it, trained in it (weapons actually and as a child unarmed) and trained in more effective methods-    however, when i do say that i'll admit to generalizing-    ok- there is some benefit that can be gained from it if trained properly- problem is that there is too much emphasis on the form itself, and not what it is supposed to teach AND i think that if there is another more efficient way to teach the theory and purpose and technique (whatever) behind it then that should be taught.    IMO- the only reason to teach the "longer" version when a shorter more efficient method exists is to keep the student around longer to collect more money from them.  in essence to teach them something in 5 years or 6 years that they could learn in 4.    and the vast majority of people that i come across who have trained in kata tend to come from those kinds of schools where they dont teach application and the proper mechanics behind each technique that makes it up.    I know it is not a simple issue- i know even what i have typed here has many exceptions- other details, examples, etc. but to write a thesis on the internet every time kata comes up is ridiculous.  so to go with the basic generalization and steer people away from what is most of the time going to be bad is IMO a better tactic on a message board and this is even more limited than a message board.    so in the limited paramaters of the y/a system and over the internet in general- it is better advice IMO to steer a person away- who does not have the background and knowledge to know for themselves (or they would not be asking on y/a) the difference between a good teacher who uses kata as a method to train, and a bad one.    same reason why i seem to come down hard here on the arts that are the most fraught with crappy gyms and poor training methods- simply the attention span of the reader and the limitations of this forum and the internet in general-     sure i can say how you can learn kicking techs from tkd and apply them to what you know or the merits of aikido schools that teach proper breakfalls and include how some joint locks can be incorporated into an overall art or how some of the solo forms of cma can be used as a body-weight excercise to build muscle and add to grip sensativity.    however if i do that i'm all over the place and the odds of a person who isn't "in the know" taking that information and bieng utterly confused by it is high while if they keep training they will eventually come across someone who does do some of that well for them to add to thier repotiore.    as for kata- i thik the same thing, in the overall picture on greater than avereage frequency it is not used efficiently or effectively for training methodology so when you have no specific information about a gym to go on or an instructor- what the hell are we supposed to do?     even writing an answer as long as i have here is too much but people here are looking for discussion in this question- not simple answers for confused and uninformed people.    as it is i feel i write too much in those answers when people actually looking for help zone out after one or two sentances.    IMO- in actuallity i don't think there are any legit crappy martial arts ("chi" masters and jedi force practitioner types excluded), only crappy training- even a less applicable art has something of use- it might only be a small part of the style or techniques but there is something to learn from any art- but to say that is to possibly send a person who doesn't know better to the clutches of a crappy teacher just looking to rip them off or a low quality mcdojo.    granted- i send people along the route that worked for me- i started really training with boxing, and was able to discern whats legit and not becasue i knew what it was like to have someone coming after me throwing blows.    i used to get into "ray leonard vs bruce lee" type discussions with friends all the time when i was younger and my bias was obvious then. now- it is not. but if i started with shotokahn forms and nothing else then i feel i would be talking out of my *** based upon lack of real knowledge and contact training and not out of bias that can later be dropped.|`|6QrnOBZVaa	The more i do advanced techniques, the more i rely on the body movement that I develop from Katas.

But be assured that I will not start doing my kata during a self defense situation.    Being a martial artist qualifies me to make this statement.  I have trained under numerous knowledgeable instructors some heavy handed on kata others not so heavy handed.      Bruce Lee's principles do have a degree of validity in self defense application.  Just as kata is not completely worthless.|`|AA10499716	Hi,    Well in my opinion the "Kata" isn't going to more or less help you with self defense. It enables you to develop your skill as a fighter, and to increase the repertoire of movements at your disposal. However the real life application of these movements are going to morph to fit the situation.     So in a way yes the "Kata" will help you defend yourself. But only the movements embedded in them. Not the actual "Kata" since it is a simulated fight.    One last thing, people are ignorant and what they don't understand they will criticize. The only thing that matters is that when push comes to shove your are capable of handling yourself. The opinions of the populace should be frivolous in the eyes of a true martial artist.|`|8PBA3kc2aa	Just to add my two cents worth. To me, Kata is to Karate, what Shadow boxing is to Boxing. Both help aid with one's training in coordination, proper body mechanics, reflex and rythm. The only difference is, in boxing they don't have Shadow boxing competions unlike in Karate where they have Kata competitions(sometimes independent of Kumite matches). So it's a lot easier for people to lose focus on the goals of training in Karate, which is the actual sparring against an opponent, since winning Kata competitions sometimes becomes a goal in itself. While most boxers know that the goal of shadow boxing is to improve his actual performance in the ring. I agree with most opinions posted above regarding the need for a good teacher who understand and teaches the proper applications of Kata for it to be useful in self defense. Regarding the slow pace issue, I'd suppose it's all about personal preference and what your goals for training are. Most people train for self defense, so it is understandable why they would be more result oriented and would prefer the faster and, in their opinion, more effective methods. But there are some who train just for the joy of experiencing the training. For them, as the saying goes, "it's about the journey and not the destination". So I would not be inclined hold it against them either.|`|u9C7HYomaa	Bruce Lee wasn't against kata itself, but the fix positions that they have in them. He didn't like the dead space involved or the non realistic reactions of opponents. I am not a Bruce Lee expert but from what I read this is what he meant.
13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	i have to disagree with 'dave of the hill people' when he said sweed isn't the blocking receiver hines is.  do you remember the baltimore game this post season and the perfect spiral limas totally whiffed on (who doesn't?)...remember the next play after that, when limas totally decked corey ivy?  here, watch:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1fbkEOQw...    tell me that kid doesn't have what it takes to replace hines as a badass blocking WR?      i think he'll be fine.  he didn't play hardly at all this year.  he had just 6 catches for 64 yards, and mostly those came in mop up game situations when starters were pulled.  it was his first HUGE game, i mean HUGE.  afc championship game against a hated rival meeting for the 3rd time, and they throw him in there to completely throw off the ravens, AT HOME, in front of 65,000 people?!  can you imagine how hard his little heart was pounding??!  the kid cracked, and ya know what, it's ok.  just as long as he got it out of his system.  i'm sure hines gave him a bunch of sh*t for that dropped pass, and i know tomlin did as well.  hopefully he learned his lesson.    i think he needs more touches this next year to build some confidence.  it's way too early to tell if he can replace ward (well, no one can replace ward)...but as mentioned earlier, he'll have to work his way up the ladder.|`|fHxpycJSaa	If he doesn't stop faking injuries and costing his team timeouts, he'll have a real short career. However, I got a feeling Coach Tomlin will get him to see the light. Or else.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think limas sweed is going to be a very slow to develop player and might never really reach all the potential that was seen in him at the combines last year,there is a reason why he was not a first rounder.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	I find it more likely that Holmes would replace Ward's role with Sweed possibly being a poor man's Plaxico- type WR that the offense had a few years ago.  He certainly needs more time to develop before we even think about that though...maybe he can fill in as a number 3 guy next year with Washington likely gone and go from there....|`|dfo8gSaraa	I agree but not as a starter.  If Ward is done, Sweed should be  3 WR behind Holmes and Washington.|`|tNerdFYsaa	No he can't replace Ward, and i don't think he fits in Pittsburgh. When he dropped that ball in the Championship game, the fans were booing as it is. Then he faked the injury and they booed more. He has to understand its bad enough to drop that ball, and you are gonna get criticized. Then you fake an injury!? that doesn't roll with the Steelers and their fans. A real steeler would of got up and sprinted back to the huddle. I say he ends up in a few years on a sissy team like the Seahawks|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Give him some time and Steeler fans will be happy with him.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|V7dGe2kqaa	limas sweed sucks and is an idiot. he almost cost the steelers points in the game vs baltimore.|`|cCbKZGKzaa	not a steelers fan, but from what I've seen from sweed, the talent is there.  You are right, though, about him needing another year or so before he starts, he often looks lost on the field. When the mental side of him develops, he will be a great wr.|`|f73191db65c7bbf85c16893fa3daf443aa	Let's see how he progresses with another offseason...being a go-to receiver is not something that can be coached, that's why there aren't that many in the league...if he can be fearless across the middle, be consistent with his hands, run good routes, and beat single coverage when needed then YES, he can be that guy for the Steelers.|`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	Wide receivers typically click in their third year in the league.  I look forward to what Sweed can do at that time.  I am a patient Steelers fan.  :)    But Sweed is not Ward & he should not be shoved into that role.  Ward is the best run-blocking WR in the league & that is where Sweed just isn't well-suited.  The team should try to utilize Sweed the way the used to utilize Burress: big downfield threat that can catch jump balls and score TDs.  When Ward retires, a different WR (or position-switching QB) will need to take his possession/blocking WR role.    Could Sweed be a big player on 3rd downs?  Sure.  But he has a ways to go before he can be the "dependable" 3rd down WR.  Until he's ready, the team has TE Heath Miller to perform that role (and Santonio Holmes going deep to keep defenses honest.)|`|19pANvMBaa	I'm a Steeler fan.  If he does not improve greatly next year, I see him possibly getting cut.  They drafted Fred Gibson out of Georgia in the 2nd round.  He didn't pan out and they cut him.  I hope Sweed picks up the play, but if he doesn't, he may not be in Pittsburgh for long.|`|LszMroCqaa	let's not judge him until he's higher than 4th on the depth chart.  him and washington should have a nice training camp battle.

lBhkWpDoaa	I see Manny putting up monsters  's this year|`|hR87A418aa	Manny will have a better season... age just a number look at last season numbers where better then tex's.. especilly if manny stays with the dodgers he could easily win mvp over there.. no pitching in NL :)|`|keXaF4Puaa	Tex. I don't think Manny's numbers in the "I'm not signed to play with anybody league" will  mean anything|`|iLQojxY1aa	i'm gonna have to go with Teixeira.....    Manny is starting to get older, what is he 37? 38? plus Teixeira is gonna be in a Yankees line up full of offense, with Jeter and and the top of the order getting on base it will give him plenty of chances to put up big numbers....Manny hasn't even signed yet, who knows where he'll end up...and if he goes with the dodgers he won't nearly have the line up Teixeira will have infront of him....|`|4SKmjYrsaa	Manny! He's gonna hit more homers and have a much better average and OBP in the National League    Tex will score more runs because of the team around him    RBI's is a toss up|`|nSSKixvCaa	I think Tex as well. Manny is about to move to his decline and Tex is about to reach his prime.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	I agree 100% with the navyguy4!|`|bXGwTQy6aa	Mark its surrouded by a better quad  but he's not even close to manny when it comes to crunch time...he might put better numbers during the regular season but whats gonna happen come playoff times...i mean given the Hankees will make it out of the first round|`|VPDcy4Qwaa	Depends on what Manny gets and if he's happy. A happy manny would beat Tex an upset manny would not.|`|3mZyMnjfaa	are u serious with this question when texiera puts up the same numbers as many over a 10 year period then we shall talk obviously manny|`|n6Z0GEhqaa	Texiera|`|ozVqauMXaa	This depends on one thing...Manny's contract.  If all he gets is a 1 year contract, then he will still be playing for one the next year, and he'll have a monster year.  If he gets signed to 3 or more years, then expect him to pull his usual "Manny being Manny" stuff.  Teixeira is a very good player, but he is not in Manny's league, at least where Manny ought to be.

I disagree with you in saying other teams are improving, take the blinkers off and you will see it's the 'big' two that are getting worse, not them getting better....|`|Q4aGkwGLaa	I SURE AM LOVE... NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A ONE HORSE RACE, STILL THINK WE'LL EDGE IT THO BUT YA NEVER KNOW... LOOKING FWRD TO THE NXT OLD FIRM GAME!!!! AND I HOPE THE ABERDEEN'S AND DUNDEE UTD IMPROVE EVEN MORE... IT'S GOOD TO SEE US GETIN A KICK UP THE **** MORE FREQUENTLY|`|I0eXOtStaa	Yes I have to agree that points will be dropped by both teams in the run in, whether others are getting stronger or the the old firm are going backwards is a matter of opinion, mine is Rangers and Celtic are not as strong as in previous seasons.  Still it makes for an exciting climax, I think Rangers will just edge it but would not like my life to depend on it|`|AA12241539	Rangers or Celtic? Very boring! It would be great for some other team to give them a run;but I do not think it will ever happen,|`|UKf5yZ1eaa	I'll agree teams like Aberdeen and United have improved but it's hardly exciting for us knowing Celtic or Rangers will win the league is it. As long as United finish above Aberdeen I'll be happy, couldna care less wha wins the league.|`|2sxiHRvzaa	it will come down to injuries i believe.can see 2 crappy old firm teams drop points aw season|`|8IzeMTmLaa	Yeah, it is exciting.|`|VgwXLHl5aa	Don't know boot you but I wouldn't bet dundee or aberdeen in a month of Sundays for winning the spl any time soon. I mean even though it may seem as though they've improved have they really?? Nah I only ever see it being celtic and rangers
J6xmZqj1aa	To get into optimal shape you need years of base training, and then speed work, but you could probably do what you need to do in a matter of months (2-6).|`|WrDGhduxaa	How long have you been running, and did you take off several years?  It depends on how much and how long you have been running.  You are trying to get to an 8 minute pace, which looking at your times now should not take more than 2 months if you are serious about training.  You will need to run 5 times each week to progress rapidly.  I never pay much attention to a heart rate monitor while running. The figures on your max is like a height weight chart, not too accurate.  Run comfortably 3 days, and run harder 2 days.  Every other week you can do a time trial to see your progress.|`|OsjT9jszaa	As long as you have a consistent running program I thing you can do that in about a month.  You probably need to make sure you are running that at least 3-4 times a week.|`|RbWmygLTaa	If you are in great shape already, I say 2 months time should do it..
rseD4OG2aa	I'm a big Cena fan and I won't insult you or anything.   I have no problem with people who dislike John Cena, to each his own, but I just don't like many of the reason people give. The usual things you'll here people say about him are that he has a "Superman" gimmick, he only has five moves and that he has the championship too much.  I don't understand how people can hate John Cena but still like Triple H. Triple H has had the belt 12 times and has been in the spotlight for over a decade now. He never shifts to the mid card and his moveset hasn't changed since 1995. He hasn't lost cleanly to anyone except Randy Orton in the last three years. Isn't that too much?  As for Cena, it is true that he has been in the spotlight quite a bit. But it's not like he buries guys. Take a look at just before he injured his neck against Batista. At Night of Champions 08 he put over Triple H cleanly for the WWE title. At the Great American Bash JBL went over cleanly to him in that Parking Lot Brawl or whatever it was. And then at Summerslam Batista pinned him cleanly. How many other main event faces can you list that have put over guys cleanly in three consecutive PPV's?   While Cena's move-set isn't the greatest, I don't have a problem with it. I think that the number of moves he uses on a regular basis are comparable to to most other guys.   The main reason why I like John Cena though is because I really, really respect him as a person. I really like his whole "Hustle, Loyalty, Respect" slogan and I think that, at the risk of getting a whole lot of thumbs down here, that he's a great role model for kids to look up to. I like DX, but you can't deny that it's better for kids to hear "Hustle, Loyalty, Respect" over "Suck It!".  Also, the work that Cena does outside the ring is undeniable. All of the things he puts into charities like the Make-A-Wish foundation are amazing. Not to many guys do things like that.   Overall though I find him to be a really entertaining wrestler. He's great on the mic and I just find his matches fun to watch.|`|gCG1uUafaa	I have to agree with Clark...    I am not John Cenas greatest fan but i do like to watch his matches and as previously stated he does alot outside the ring as well.    Stop being so hard on him!!|`|AA10162950	Better Than Hulk Hogan? are u kidding me. What in the blue hell has Cena done that Hogan hasn't dude get your facts straight Cena is not a better wrestler than Hogan.    Hulk Hogan  WWE Hall of Fame in 2005  12x World Champion  6x WWF/E Champion  6x WCW World Heavyweight Champion  1x Tag Team Champion with Edge  2x Royal Rumble Winner in 1990 and 1991      John Cena  4x World Champion  1x World Heavyweight Championship  2x World Tag Team Championship  with Shawn Michaels (1) and Batista (1)  3x WWE Championship  3x WWE United States Championship  1x Royal Rumble Winner (2008)|`|k2fFfNtRaa	I would like to see Chris Jericho Win but i would think that Cena will come out being the champ again.|`|3icTrKLLaa	I'm not a Cena fan, but i don't dislike him either. I'm neutral.    He is a better wrestler than Hulk Hogan, Sid Vicious, Great Khali, and Vince Mcmahon. All 4 of those guys have been world champs, so i figure it could be worse right now.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I'll just be a smart-***...  WHY NOT?|`|hL3eS2zKaa	HA! Hilarious. He's a good wrestler, I'm not a fan of his, but he like sooo overrated.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Because he is NOT a jerk like you|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Because I'm not fixated on him like some people are.|`|9fjTXvrQaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...|`|4Nx9ZVDyaa	he is ok... but i dont really like that fake WWE stuff. UFC is way better... if u ask me thay are all a bunch of fakes.|`|fV9SawuPaa	lol, I'm personally not. But for all you Cena fans out there, the first answerer, Ruby, is the reason why we strongly dislike Cena fans. 99% of them don't know the difference between a german suplex and a STF. They see muscles so they watch the dude. Not to say ALL Cena fans are like that, but a lot are.|`|AA11045021	All his move are overrated, but I think he's a solid wrestler.|`|KwjmH3EVaa	hes a marine so i look up to him but i dont watch it anymore ufc all the way!!!!!! it be cool if he joined ufc though then you would find out if he was faking all his moves|`|Hda1ic24aa	Im not a cena fan ha ha

qaazUSHOaa	My first thought was actually Metallica, my favorite band, but of course that wouldn't appeal to very many black people. But when I seriously think of who had/has the most fans or would be liked by the most people, I come up with The Beatles(dead), Elvis(dead), The Rolling Stones(already done it), U2(already done half time show), and so on. I think the reason you can't please black people is because there could be a few problems with having a rapper perform... well, Usher would be good. I don't even like most rap/hip-hop and I still think that Usher is very talented.    Then it's settled Usher and Kanye West(a jerk but a great performer).|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Boy George and the Culture Club, Chumbawumba, or Right Said Fred would be the best options.......|`|jhNUuz0maa	The Aerosmith half time show is one that needs repeating. It had Aerosmith for the old flavor. Then, Britney Spears and N'SYNC for the younger kids. Then, it had I believe Nelly and Mary J Blige(sp) for the R&B. Plus, they did the Run DMC version of Walk This Way. Everyone was included, well, except the Country folk.    The next Super Bowl should feature a variety of people.     I think Metallica would be awesome too, but only if they had a rapper performing over one of the songs.|`|HiuNSScLaa	i think they should do multiple artists i think mettallica 3dg [3 days grace] linkin park 3dd [3 doors down] disturbed nickleback or you can mix in rap like T.I fat joe or mix in sports anylists arguing   1st round skip bayless vs steve a smith      lol|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Definitely Metallica or Bon Jovi|`|6J5mQWj0aa	the cave men|`|qZLSMccqaa	i wouldn't mind if they had metallica.....it would allow me to have time for a restroom break!  you know, i don't want to miss any of the game and i am afraid of missing any good commercials.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	You've got to be kidding.

Manny only plays hard when he's playing for a contract so if he gets a 3 year contract then he can take it easy in 2009 and 2010 before playing hard in 2011.|`|nSSKixvCaa	Yeah, longer contract with 25 mils each year. So 100 mils.    What a greedy little man.|`|AOZvz2dpaa	at least three years at 25 mill a year|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he wants a muitiyear contrac..3 years minimun.the price ranges from 20 mil and up...but i think he wants to go to a contender...and lets face it,he might be undisciplined but his production is worth it|`|n6Z0GEhqaa	Too much!
L1QTSErIaa	Robbie Savage was never going to be a premier league player. A mediocre player at best. But his commitment to his clubs has never been questioned before. He is the type of player who has more heart then footballing skills.   Fans love to hate him. But would want him at their side.|`|lhASsVwcaa	Eh he's alright, prefer Steven Davies.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	I think Savage is a very good player.But he's right he won't be a premire leaague player ever.But a would pay a thousand euro for him to get a hair cut!!!!|`|Y7CH521faa	Actually i really like him. I like characters who have a bit of personality and no one could say he isn`t committed. He has given me a few giggles over the past few years.    http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBK4ix...
lrhOwySRaa	Looks like Barca-Miami will begin play in 2010...Portland may get a club for 2011.  I have also read that MLS might even announce in March that Vancouver will get a club for 2013.    Atlanta and Montreal pulled their bids...St. Louis seem not to have enough money...Ottawa have a great ownership grow, just no stadium (they have a plan, but no funding for it).        Join MLS fans in the French Soccer Section.
cjmtIOwlaa	I think Messi will get it next year for sure, but i believe Ronaldo did deserve it for last season.|`|lhASsVwcaa	Messi is alot better then Ronaldo full stop.    Ronaldo is over-judged by MU fans.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	He has scored 25 in 28 !!!! Wow. I will double check that.      He is a great player, Ronaldo has been quite this season.|`|0HO8sTGeaa	he will...|`|aB4n96vhaa	ronaldo was definitely deserving winner last year messi may welll win it this year he is brilliant , why cant you just enjoy both|`|8HALBjQVaa	Well..if Messi continues to play like he is now and Barca win a couple of titles then Messi should be awarded the FIFA world player award this year...but there's still plenty of games to play...he could get injured and that could ruin his chances...(it did last year) although C.R deserved it last year...Now to dominate 4 or 5 years in a row that's something huge that no one has ever accomplished,I find that impossible to do...|`|bxV80Clnaa	Yes for sure Messi will get it, he is unbelievable! Plus no one else is really standing out at the moment.|`|BjTrJG6Gaa	i think im the best soccer player, and that those two homies dont stand a chance against me!!!!!|`|AA10510647	,,,, thats a load of rubish,,,,RONALDO is much better|`|PYiQGwsAaa	These two links show why Ronaldo won the award for last seasons efforts:-    Messi - http://www.soccerbase.com/players_detail...    Ronnie - http://www.soccerbase.com/players_detail...|`|oj7vMfCQaa	Lionel Messi is a striker, and the whole team plays for him, and his job is to score goals. Ronaldo is a midfielder, and his job is to deliver good crosses.|`|gPsFFQbRaa	i duno|`|X7bWwNWcaa	Ronaldo will win it, his the biggest ponse in football and is sooooo bi headed that he knows everone is gonna vote for him and messi just aint good enough to out play ronaldo's cockiness.     question answerdish|`|aaAzufczaa	if you put it that way, then I think Messi's effort will be paid with the FIFA wold player of the year award. Only if keeps been a deligent player. Now for C.R. he did deserved the award, but for next year, I think its just too soon to say...things change, so can these players. Just look at Ronaldo from brazil; he did change(not the same outstanding potential soccer player I knew). You must be a Messi fan, because you don't even mention other players. Anyway, peek me,lol.
AA11570236	You just have to get out there & get you tent put up.Keep one of those  artificial fireplace logs to make a camp fire,if you can there.This will help keep your thoughts in check.|`|m1V5ws73aa	No, I never had a problem with sleeping alone in the woods, only being cold.  Maybe you can examine why it makes you uncomfortable even in your own backyard. There is nothing as wonderful as waking up in the woods at dawn when the only thing you hear is the birds singing, and then making your morning coffee over a campfire.  Best of luck to you.|`|vADPYe1Haa	Its very scary! I would never be able to camp by myself! There is no way... I have to be with a group or I can't do it...|`|2JqajMgeaa	Always!    Especially when its really quiet and dark but with a rustling and crunching noises every so often coming from beside the tent!
m1V5ws73aa	Anything with a Gore-Tex liner will be waterproof.  It doesn't matter what brand.|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	I wear Karrimor boots ,have worn the same pair for several years with no leaks at all. If you can't get them look for any with Gore Tex .Berghaus are a good make .|`|dWjANfQXaa	Have a look at Cotton Traders. I`ve not had walking boots but had ordinary boots and clothes, I`m very impressed with the quality.  http://www.cottontraders.co.uk/ProductDe...|`|534b588aabc2f9470b492f99f7d98b2baa	I have a pair of Karrimor walking shoes(75) with high sides and they are excellent. Very tough(I accidently ran over one in my car ,and it was fine) .They have a Gore Tex lining and have never leaked. My full on boots are Brasher Hillmasters (100) that are all leather with a very well bonded rubber cleated sole. They also have a Gore Tex lining and are water proof.  They feel light and the sole gives very good grip in mud. Brasher make a brown coloured water proofing cream to treat the leather and this keeps them in tip-top condition.|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	Marrels are the best hiking/walking shoes out there...   they have many different types of shoes..  waterproof and non-waterproof...  prices vary from 50-200 $$  you should be able to get a really nice pair for about $125 or 150  good luck =)  alss here look on this website super good deals on all sporting gear  shoe,sunglasses,tents,sleepingbags,cli... gear ect,,,    www.campmor.com|`|Hda1ic24aa	I Would recomend Nike Hikers XI they will cost you around 85 pounds from www.amazon.co.uk|`|sTFR2qVUaa	buy nike branded shoes.  they are very comfortable and usefull with the ipod connection thing in the latest ones.  Also  would like to recommend the nike air section also very solid shoes :D  thanks  hope i helped XD|`|kNSRmH8faa	For leather boots I have used Brasher hillmaster goretex for years and i'm very happy with, they do wear quickly under heavy constant use though. They are usually around 130 but shop around and you can get them for around 90. At the moment I have got a pair of Karrimor KSB with Event lining and they have been very good but not the most comfortable I've ever used. Do not buy online because you need to try the boots on in the shop to get the best fit. Nike make good trainers but I would avoid there offroad footwear as they are to flexible and to expensive for the quality and materials you get. Other good brands would be Lowa, Merrell or Meindl.
8ftxES2Zaa	"You may have heard Wayne's nickname, "Mad Anthony."    Why was he called that? Unfortunately, a misconception arose that it meant he was wild, reckless and careless. This was inaccurate. But it was popularized by the famed novelist Washington Irving years after the Revolutionary War ended. Others have thought that the nickname was given to Wayne because he always seemed to lead his men into the hottest spots during battles.    But the real reason was that Anthony Wayne had a legendary and fiery temperament. He bristled at any hint of incompetence or challenge to his honor. In fact, at the Battle of Paoli, a reason some of his officers complained about Wayne's conduct was due to his angry treatment of an officer. The hapless subordinate had incorrectly reported that some pickets had disappeared from their post. While Wayne was "hot-blooded" about some matters; he was equally "cold-blooded" when in actual battle. He shunned danger and consistently led from the front lines.    The nickname "Mad Anthony" came about several years after the Paoli Massacre"    ...    "In 1781, local constables jailed Jemmy for disorderly conduct. He told his jailers that he was Wayne's good friend and demanded to be set free. When the constables refused, Jemmy asked that a messenger be sent to General Wayne to order his release from jail. But when Wayne heard, his anger flared. He refused to intervene and added that if it happened again, he would order, "29 lashes well laid on".    Jemmy could not believe his ears when he heard Wayne's reply. Jemmy muttered, "Anthony is mad. He must be mad or he would help me. Mad Anthony, that's what he is. Mad Anthony Wayne".    This humorous tale spread around the Continental Army campfires and was repeated by soldiers in the ranks. "Mad Anthony Wayne" had a rhythm and cadence that caught on and stuck. Mad Anthony's nickname became a "nom de guerre". "|`|mggll8dRaa	Somebody said it, and the Nickname 'stuck'....!!|`|gPsFFQbRaa	i duno
