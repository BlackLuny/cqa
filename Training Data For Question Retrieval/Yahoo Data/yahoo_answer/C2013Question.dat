It looks like something is pushing down in the center of the picture, which I know is not likely..  When I strike the tv at the side behind the electronics part of the unit, it straightens out for a short while but goes right back to the dip.  Can anyone help me on this one?  the picture is still great and the sound is still great so I hate to get rid of the set for this reason.

As soon as it is converted and I watch it in the .avi version on Windows Media Player, the output is so much darker than the original. I cannot find a way to lighten the end product or set a setting on the media converter to make it lighter. I am therefore looking for a different converter. Anybody out there who knows of a good media converter that puts .avi files in its original quality? I am using Digital Media Converter 2.7, more info I cannot find on its properties. Thanks a bunch!

My uncle found three boxes of cassette tapes at a garage sale a couple of days ago and when we tried to play them the voices on the tapes were high pitched and fast. I was wondering if there was anyway to change the voices or at least slow them down. The cassettes are all TDK Type 1 D90's and I believe they are normal bias. Also I believe these tapes were used by a lawyer for either dictating purposes or for meetings with his clients. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So i am gonna buy an 8GB Iphone 3G, but i have 3 questions:      If i dont take the 2 year contract from AT&T will it still be $199.99?      If i dont want the contract from AT&T will everything still work (music, video, camera, apps, wi-fi internet)?      I have seen this last question a lot:      I have a wireless router in my house that i use with my PS3 and PSP to go on the internet, and i know on all phones with internet (with a service provider) that you dont need a wireless router, you can go on the internet anywhere. But if i dont take the 2-year contract, will the intrnet with my wireless router not work with my iphone to go on the internet?      So if i dont take the contract will i still be able to use my wireless router with my iphone (to go on the internet) or the whole internet function will just not work at all?      I know i wont be able to use the internet anywhere but my house (without the contract) with my iphone, so can anyone answer this, ILL GIVE BEST ANSWER TO THE PERSON WHO ANSWERS THIS CORRECTLY!!!!!!!!!

So I bought this mp3 player about a year ago and when I bought it it worked great never had a problem with it. Well last July, I moved half way across the country and I have seemed to have lost my charger for the wall. But, I was looking around my house and found 2 chargers that fit the Zen V. One is from my bluetooth, and the other is from my husbands cell phone. It fits perfectly, I don't have to force them in they just go in smooth as butter. The problem I am having is that I will not take a charge from either of the chargers. Know, I know that the chargers work because I use my bluetooth daily and it has to be charged up often and my husbands cell phone charger works because, well his phone isn't dead! lol      Does anyone know if my mp3 player is broken, or will it only take a Zen V charger?
