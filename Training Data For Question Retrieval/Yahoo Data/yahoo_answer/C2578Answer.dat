S01zIagOaa	The M3 is the better handling car and the C63 is a straightline power sledgehammer.

HZGao294aa	The problem with any Phaeton is that they aren't making them any more; in the US (at least) only specially appointed dealerships were able to sell the vehicle and had to have certain parts on hand for it that were limited to that vehicle.  Also those dealerships had specialassigned service techs that had many hours of training to deal with the unusual electrical and mechanical details of the vehicle and finally, those dealerships also had engineering contacts to deal with service issues that sometimes arose with these vehicles.<br>  <br>     Personally, I like the vehicle, however, it does not mean that it is a good buy used.  If you were to keep the car until the wheels fell off that is one thing, but, if you were to sell it in a couple of years you'd take a huge hit in depreciation as there is almost no market for these vehicles.<br>  What is certain is that any part that only works on a Phaeton would have to be ordered, and many of these parts only come from New Jersey, where VW maintains a major parts facing depot.  Also, I can tell you that there is very limited service support for these vehicles in the US and most of the the time the dealership is left to figure out the problems on their own!  <br>  <br>     The Phaeton is fine vehicle in its own right; but because sales were so limited everywhere, there is little interest in any aspect of the support of the vehicle:  sales, service or parts.  Parts are expensive because they don't have much movement (sales rate and sit mostly taking up shelf space).  The car also uses endless amounts of electrical wiring, relays, computer control modules, ground circuits and complex mechanical issues.  I have never had to work on an electrical issue with one of these, but know people who have and they hate working on this vehicle.<br>  <br>  The Audi A8 also suffers from limited parts availability and support, however, at least dealerships have seen it and the aftermarket provides some service and parts support for the vehicle.  It's a safer bet than a Phaeton with the knowledge that someone can repair it somewhere.<br>  <br>  The Lexus is a fine vehicle; if refinement is what you seek, then this is the choice I'd make.  It's less expensive to maintain, its repair record is better, but its not by any means a drivers car.  And resale value is unquestioned.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, a car nut.|`|S01zIagOaa	While it may be less expensive to purchase due to unpopularity and therefore severe depreciation, it will not be any less expensive to maintain than an A8. If you can afford to have a minimum of $5,000 set aside at any given time for maintenance and repairs, then go for it. If not, skip it and the A8.
pGP3gKSOaa	We have a 2001 1.8t Sport Avant (estate) it has approx 55k miles, is a sport model with standard 30mm lowered sport suspension. Is very quiet and economical. The ride is a bit harder than an SE with standard suspension but the drive is better. Would advise you try at least 2 or 3 before you buy then you will know if the one you were in was noisy or not. <br>  You should also consider a 1.9TDI (130) 2001 MODEL onwards, I had one for a company car, excellent. Good luck.|`|QPdD7o8Maa	The 1.8T can idle as noisy as a diesel.  Just have mechanic look at it before you buy.|`|S01zIagOaa	I think that would be particularly noisy but that 2000 is one of the early years of the B5 chassis and that engine is not particularly refined. It's a four banger turbo, there is going to be noise. Tire selection also has a lot do with road noise.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	I test drove a 1.8 before settling on the 2.8, as I remember it wasn't a very noisy car. Engine noise could come from a lot of things, belts, fans, a leak somewhere in the plumbing of the turbo. Road noise could be tire, bearing... if your unsure have a mechanic check it out first.

N4IvZmPiaa	The fuel tank is a lot different! Propane is only at around 200psi maximum, where NG is going to be something over 1500psi! The NG tanks are much heavier construction and add a lot more weight to the vehicle. There would be under-the hood differences too. The basic components are similar, but the two fuels burn at different rates and temperatures, so some of the equipment will be different.<br>  <br>   If you are thinking of converting from LPG to NG, you are probably loking at pretty close to the same cost as converting from gasoline...|`|0z5oESMSaa	It's certainly possible, since most LPG vehicles are bi-fuel vehicles that use LPG and gasoline. You could certainly add CNG to this as well. As for trying to use the same system as LPG, it will be much more complicated because of the inherent differences in LPG and CNG as a fuel and their different characteristics.

I did this in Hawaii.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Absolutely not. You should have canceled the insurance when you sold the car. Just buy the insurance that the rental car company offers because if you have an accident with the rental car you will have to pay for any damages.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	You can call your insurance company and ask them, but it should be. If your planning on getting another car anytime soon don't let your policy lapse, you'll pay more for insurance when you get another car.|`|q8cBE6w8aa	I think it is best to tell your insurance company that you sold your car.  If the new owner gets into an accident, you may be liable.  <br>  <br>  Let them know you are renting a car, and find out if you have coverage on the rental.  The insurance companies sell  a special rental clause added to the policy, which is s a whole lot cheaper than paying for the insurance from the rental agency.  If you have your own rental coverage, you have to sign a waiver to avoid their expensive insurance.<br>  <br>  Check this out, as i am not sure on all this, but this is how it worked for me.<br>  <br>  Johnny.|`|SuZbBnycaa	Wow, good question. Insurance policies are both car specific and person specific.... so you may be covered but the car won't be. I would buy the rental car insurance just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  BTW, I hope you signed a Release of Liability for the car you just sold, and turned it into the DMV or AAA Auto Club. They like you to do that with in 5 days of your selling the vehicle.|`|dyIyJqauaa	probably not.because you no longer own the vehicle that the insurance would extend from.... On the other hand, a decent company may cover based on a "temporary situation".  I would call my agent and ask
Y1LTzXataa	No fires in Eildon. There's a fire near Healesville though, which might give you trouble travelling on the Maroondah Highway, but at this point that fire is contained.

dFj8c1fjaa	I would say that a Honda hatch, in my own opinion would be the way to go. No hatches really have a small back end, and are not round. But the EG hatches (1992-1995) are a good looking and reliable car. And tend to get around 40-46 mpg, in any model thats not the SI. I would recommend looking for a good used one of these, as sometimes you will get lucky and find a nice one for cheap. Even an 1988-1991 hatch will treat you well, as long as its previous owners took good care of it. Just carefully inspect whatever you choose to buy, listening for engine ticks, making sure the axles do not pop when turning, etc etc.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	It sounds like you don't really want a hatchback if you don't want something with a big backend.|`|ACJNMGxkaa	civic hatch<br>  vw gti<br>  these are my favs

wpg6zTMQaa	Also remember the antifreeze you drain from your car is toxic so you need to collect it and dispose of it properly. I have a 2002 focus and you have to remove the bottom hose on it.|`|vF0botDuaa	On the side of the radiator, down by the bottom, there should be a drain screw (pit ****). Unscrew this and it will allow the coolant to drain. You will also want to loosen the radiator cap to release the vaccume. Make sure that you drain it into a container and dispose of it properly. Cat and dogs love the antifreeze, but it will kill them. Once the radiator has drained, tighten the pit **** and refill with antifreeze. If you don't want to mess with it, most quick oil change places will flush it out for you pretty cheap. I think the one by my house charges $15.00 or so? Not too bad considering a gallon of antifreeze costs about $12.00. Also, follow the directions on the antifreeze for dilution. You don't want to put straight antifreeze in your car. It needs to be mixed w/ water. Any problems, just let me know. I'll be happy to help. Good Luck.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Remove the lower radiator hose at the radiator.|`|pQ0qy63haa	There should be a plug at the very bottom of the radiator, but in some radiators they don't have one. Just pull of the bottom radiator hose and let it drain that way, then put it back on. Then refill it.
CyjuTf0raa	Not only is this very unorthodox, it most definitely wouldn't work as well. Here's why:<br>  1) Heating it up to bend it would reduce the overall stability of the metal.<br>  2) The chances of you bending it back to something acceptable are very low.<br>  3) The chances of you further destroying your car are HIGH.<br>  <br>  Just go to a local shop and get it fixed that way. It may seem the expensive way out, but it is much better than destroying the rest of your car; a small repair will always be cheaper than replacing your vehicle.|`|fc89b197ffdf73238dd66eb9a87062d0aa	Nope, not a good idea AT ALL. Have you inspected everything else and looked for other damage? Once you know everything is OK I would just go the local Junk Yard or Pick and Pull type place and get another.

5xxuKzXPaa	two questions that i have, do you like power, and can you find a ride with out that car. if you answered yes to both of these along with the ability to find the money to get the parts, then go ahead and do it. i would, but i love the ability to do 80 in first gear with three more to go. i could not get to your 360 to see the car.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Depends on if you want to pay the expense.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	I would say your best option would be to get an amp that runs around 2000w RMS @ 1 ohm.  To get a 1 ohm load you would have to get the Dual 1 ohm version of the sub.<br>  <br>  Finding a good amp that runs that much power is going to be fairly difficult.  Make sure to get a good quality amp and not one that advertises 2000w RMS but actually puts out much less power.<br>  <br>  If you are running that much power you will need to do the "big 3" upgrade as well as upgrade your alternator to a high output alternator.  The alternator will need to be able to put out a large amount of current in order to fully power your system.<br>  <br>  If you do not upgrade your alternator you can not get 2000w RMS on a stock electrical system.  You would be better off getting a single BL and spending the money you saved on a better amp.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|bzvA7ZP4aa	idk what amp you should get. personally i would just get 2 power acoustik bamfs that match the rms of your subs. and i would say dual 2 ohm. the audio guys i know say 1 ohm is too hot. and daily or spl depends on how loud you like it. spl is going to be really loud and daily will be easiler on your ears.

wpgRMjgraa	Okay.......I will assume that whoever replaced the steering column replaced it with a somewhat same unit and if so then both types of steering columns (with and without tilt wheel) will have the necessary dimmer switch, dimmer switch rods and dimmer switch rod brackets.<br>  <br>  There would be no reason why this should have not been installed so that this feature would work unless the installer just got lazy..<br>  <br>  Remember that many parts from both steering columns (with and without tilt wheel) are the same and will interchange.

The gauge changes from one tank to the next when you flip the switch.<br>  For it to be the sender unit, it would have to be both tanks, which is unlikely but not impossible. I suspect the problem is in the wiring or the guage itself.<br>  Does it go to empty when the power is off?<br>  If it does not return to empty, then the problem is in the gauge.|`|DkjQHmD6aa	hey your problem is in the sending unit calibration. the correct way is not cheap, ford sells the fuel pump with the fuel gauge in one module<br>  a little over $200 not including labor to remove and replace the affected tank you have three options 1)fix it. 2)use only unaffected tank,3)estimate mileage hope this helps.|`|frR8whfJaa	Check your ground wire going to the fuel tanks.ford is known for this problem.

GtBOQPKqaa	You have to crunch your numbers and see whether your budget will allow for this car. To do this, take your monthly take-home pay and deduct your cellphone bill and the "couple necessities."<br>  <br>  What is that number? Will it allow you to cover the payments? Remember, you'll also have to worry about gas, maintenance, insurance, and so forth, and your budget HAS to accommodate them. If it won't, then you may have to dispense with one or both of those "necessities."<br>  <br>  You're assuming that, in this economy, you'll land a second job. Don't put your eggs in one basket here, as you may not get it; therefore, you should base your calculations on just your current income.<br>  <br>  Now, has your father agreed to BE a cosigner on the loan? This is significant, because if YOU cannot make the payments, your dad will be responsible. And he may not like that prospect.<br>  <br>  I was able to finance my first new vehicle at the age of eighteen, WITHOUT a parent's co-signature. While it was totaled in an accident seven weeks later, I was able to buy its replacement, and I even managed to pay it off over five years.|`|SuZbBnycaa	Also add in $2000+ a year for gas and hundreds of dollars each year to renew registration on a new car. <br>  New cars are more expensive to insure and maintain. <br>  <br>  For a first car, ease your way into the world of Financial Albatross around your neck.|`|DTJTe9wxaa	dont get a brand new one, you will regret it. you wont have any extra cash after the full coverage insurance you will have to pay and the monthly payments on your car. plus gas and your cell phone. i bought a 12,000 car and make about the same you do and have NO extra cash to spend/save.|`|kjV9QqwSaa	It's very simple once you figure out what your monthly payment<br>  will be.

GBofRdHYaa	This is like bringing your own food to a restaurant & asking them to prepare it.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Any reputable auto repair shop will not install customer supplied parts. Pay them for the parts and installation.|`|AA11357570	Well, a shop may charge you slightly more but since there doing the work, let them go get the parts. They get discounts and charge you retail, not the price there getting it for or even the sale price to consumers. But its easy enough paying another few dollars then to go buy the parts when chances are, the mechanic is going to run into another problem and have to buy run and go buy other parts anyway.|`|5xueRvGtaa	Some times when you buy the parts from the shop it may cost a couple bucks more. But sometimes by buying parts from them, they will give you a sweet deal on labor costs. And they have warranties on anything you buy and have put in.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	Generally the shop is not going to charge you much more for the parts than you can buy them for yourself, unless your going to a dealer. Also you might end up with the wrong parts.
aa9gieAIaa	it can depend on what car you have. many alternators can fluctuate quite a bit depending on load while some fluctuate very little.. also some ive seen intentionally give short spikes of higher voltage when the battery is charging fast. my dads dodge truck charges at like 15-16 volts for a minute or so then instantly drops to say 14 and never varies after that. ive seen other trucks like his with the same alt. do the same thing exactly too and never have a problem. it may be ok but i don't know for sure, you might want to mention the year and model.|`|oCwi3aU7aa	If your relying on the gauge, I wouldn't trust that to be that accurate.  Check the alternator directly with a voltmeter, and if there are no abnormal problems with your car such as pulsing lights or the engine running strangely during this time you probably have nothing to worry about.  If you want to have it checked some parts stores such as autozone will check your alternator for free.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Izdn45nEaa	yes, 13.2 to 14 volts is normal. if it stays above 15 for periods of time, i'd get it checked.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	11-15 volts is a range, a fully charged battery should be 12.6 with nothing on. a running engine should bring that voltage to 13-5 to 14.5. 15 volts is a sign of over-charging. i would get that checked out.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Not normal. An alternator should never put out more than 14.5 volts.

Since you rarely get a chance to inspect or test-drive such vehicles, you are taking a chance if you buy. Used car dealers, who buy these kinds of vehicles frequently can afford to get get a dud on some vehicles if they get bargains on others.<br>  <br>  I would say don't participate in such auctions unless you know exactly what you're doing, and can at least inspect the car mechanically.

Its prob a good buy. test drive the vehicle and see what it feels like at highway speed. if it handles well- your prob safe!<br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|10t6humiaa	Yes, it can be a good car. Of course, there are factors to consider, including, but not limited, the following. Does it drive okay? Does it track itself well? Does the repair job look professional?<br>  If possible, view photos of the vehicle before repair work was done to determine the extent of the damage, etc.<br>  Personally, I have a rebuilt Jeep and in two years had no problem with it. However, I know the shop that did the work and they specialize in this business and do really good work and stand behind their vehicles.<br>  Of course, it will have lower resale value when you want to trade or sell it.|`|ACJNMGxkaa	yes they can but i really depends on why it was a salvage car in the first place.   like was it flooded or in a huge accident???.<br>  if so then it would be a bad buy.  cars that have been in larger accidents are not as safe a a perfect condition car.  if flooded   future problems with rust and electrical problems are more likly.<br>  <br>  sometimes cars are salvaged becuase of theft.  and the insurnce company has already payed out the original owner or the car was partly stripped  then it wouldnt be as bad..|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	Make sure you can get insurance.

But the chances are slim to none. You never know what that car has been through. Therefore, many things on that car could be damaged but just have not completely went out yet.

One thing you might consider.  If the car was previously totaled you may not be able to get insurance for it.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	It could be, but the car does not still have any warranty left on it because an insurance company has declared it a total loss because the cost of repair exceeds the value of the car. If you buy this car I've got a slightly used bridge you may be interested in.|`|AA11357570	Wrecked cars mean nothing. The only thing you need to look out for is dawged out cars. If you take a ride out of the city to a more rural country like area, you'll find better quality cars at better prices and chances are, won't be as worn out because there isn't as much stop and go traffic in rural areas.
wOSBjO9caa	Unless you can afford to pay the owner of the Lexus a couple of thousand dollars for his repairs, you better report it to your insurance company.<br>  <br>  If he suffered any injury, then it may well cost several thousand more.<br>  <br>  And, as state laws require you to exchange information, I assume you gave him your insurance info. If the other driver contacts your carrier and you did not report it, it will be far worse for you.<br>  <br>  Finally, under the financial responsibility laws of most states, if you did not give him your insurance info, and if he reports the accident to the DMV as is required, they will assume you are uninsured and suspend your driver's license. In some states if you are stopped for any reason with a suspended license driving an uninsured vehicle, they will impound it.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Always police report an accident and always notify your insurance company.....Always !                  spell check|`|T6y2zIO1aa	If you rear ended a 2008 Lexus SUV, your auto insurance is going up no matter what you do.

AA10857222	ok if you have a lead foot like myself the intake will be nullified in saving you gas but if you drive steady and you maintain the speed limit you would see a difference in gas mileage now it adds 5-10 horses depending on what type of intake you buy you buy a short ram which is your best bet by the way you get 5-10 horses.  you get a v2 intake which costs a little more you get somewhere around 15... now the more cool air you add to your car the more gas mileage your car gets remember dat and you will have more power also w/ cooler air|`|AA11585808	It isn't difficult to put an intake onto a car. <br>  I guess a Honda is more cramped than a Chevy though.

ul6P8doWaa	From the way you described it, it may very well be that the valves are out of spec and needs to be adjusted.  With normal and regular use, valve components will wear slightly and therefore, needs to be adjusted back to spec.  The valves are located under the valve cover and can easily be accessed once the cover has been removed.  If you know how to perform the adjustment provided you have the proper tools then adjust it yourself or take it in to have an auto technician do it for you.  It's really not that expensive and well worth it if you never had the valves adjusted before.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	that could also be a bad engine mount. if a mount has separated and you change the load on the engine, it can move the engine past the limitations of that mount making contact with metal some where. i have a single mount that is in this condition, but i plan to replace all 4 of them in the near by future.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Replace the knock sensor or use a higher octane gas.|`|5PqD4k3Raa	Sounds like the one of the lifters bumping or maybe a bent rod. but id put my money on the lifter. it is very common and poses no threat- drive it till it dies
gEw83TRTaa	Leasing can be good for the right people.<br>  <br>  Essentially, in a lease, you never "own" the car. You make payments for 2-3 years, then hand the car back. Think about it almost like a long-term rental.<br>  <br>  There are some advantages to leasing under the right circumstances.<br>  <br>  First, if you trade out of cars every 2-3 years, it might be right for you. In a lease, you have a contract for a fixed amount of time. I discourage leasing past 3yrs - 2 is better. In a 'loan', after 2 yrs, if you try to trade you will probably be upside down, and owe more than the car is worth. So, in order to get out of it, you have to have a lot of cash, or finance that negative on the next car. <br>  <br>  The contract will tell you that your payments are $x per month plus tax. At the end of the term, you will have a residual value for the car. The lease company basically says "In three years, we feel this car will be worth $Y" You have the option to buy the car at the end of the lease for that amount. If you are in love with the car, or it is worth well above the residual, you may want to consider that. However, in most cases, you simply hand over the keys and walk away.<br>  <br>  In a lease, there is a specified amount of mileage. Most leases are constructed around 12K or 15K miles per year. If you go over the mileage, there will be a per-mile penalty at the end of the lease. So, if you drive a lot, it may not be for you.<br>  <br>  Leasing typically allows a person to get a nicer car for the same payment as a lower-end car on a loan. that is because of that residual. You are only "financing" the difference between sales price and residual. In a loan, you are financing the entire purchase price.<br>  <br>  In other words, if a car has a sale price of $25,000. on a three year lease, lets say the residual is $15,000. You are only "financing" $10,000 for 3 yrs. If you were to buy that same car, you would finance $25,000 either for a longer term, or a much higher 36 month payment.<br>  <br>  Lastly, in a lease you pay less sales tax. In a conventional purchase on that $25k car, you pay tax on the whole 25,000. In a lease, you pay sales tax on the monthly payment. In other words, your payment of $300/month is actually $300+sales tax. BUT you are only paying tax on the leased amount - in the earlier example you are only paying sales tax on $10,000.<br>  <br>  To those who say "never lease" -- read this forum for 30 mintues. For every lease 'horror story' you read, you will see 20 people who are upside down on a 6 yr purchase and no way out. The key is to be thoroughly informed about the pros and cons of both, and make an educated decision based on your needs and lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Times leasing is good: You trade cars ever few years, you dont drive more than 12-15k per year, you want to put less down<br>  <br>  Times it is bad: You like to keep cars a long time, you drive a lot, you want to put a lot of cash down.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped some|`|MkCGveKGaa	Why I like leasing:<br>  <br>      * Lower out of pocket “drive-offs”: Leasing generally requires you to put little money down. Just your 1st month’s payment, taxes, license and fees.<br>      * Lower monthly payments: Since you aren’t paying for the whole car (just the depreciation, interest and tax typically), your payments are less than buying.<br>      * Car is almost always under warranty: 24-48 month terms will typically keep your car under warranty during your lease period.<br>      * New car every 24-48 months: You can enjoy the excitement, upgraded technology and safety of a new car every few years.<br>      * Option to purchase your car at lease-end: You can sometimes renegotiate the sale price of the car again, saving you more money.<br>      * Previous Owner: You know who the previous driver was, YOU<br>      * You can make some money at lease-end: If you take good care of your car and keep the miles well below your yearly allowance, you can sometimes get money back on a trade-in.<br>  <br>  Things to consider:<br>  <br>      * You can’t lease any car: Getting a good deal generally depends on three things; depreciation, interest (money factor) and any rebates/incentives the dealer or manufacturer will give you. Some cars depreciate much slower than others. (i.e. BMW 3-series vs Ford Fusion).<br>      * Mods: You can make modifications to your car, but you must restore the vehicle to original factory specs if you return it<br>      * Turn-in fees: Some contracts have them, some don’t. Just make sure you know what you’re getting into.<br>      * No equity: A car is generally a depreciating asset. You can’t avoid it even if you buy it. In some rare cases, you actually can get some equity out of your lease if you use it as a trade-in.<br>      * Insurance higher: Leases have a minimum coverage requirement, which is higher than most people insure their cars for. However, if you own a home, it shouldn’t make much of a difference since you should be covered by more than just the “bare minimum”. Typically, insurance rates drop as your car gets older. Since you drive a new one every few years on a lease, you will pay more over the long run; same goes for car registration.<br>      * Limited miles: This isn’t THAT big of deal unless you don’t know how many miles you typically drive. Please note that if you commute far and put more than 15,000 miles are year, leasing is NOT for you. The main reason dealers limit your miles is because the more miles put on it, the less equity the car has.<br>      * Which is cheaper? Buying or Leasing? In my experience, buying becomes cheaper than leasing AFTER you keep the car for 6+ years. IF you sell it before that, it is about the same<br>  <br>  Obviously, leasing is not for everyone. It is a reoccurring cost, so if you like not having payments in the long run, you either buy from the car from beginning or buy your lease at the end of it’s term. Whether you lease or buy, driving a car is always going to have reoccurring costs. Buying just gives you breaks in between the payments (once your loan is paid off).|`|BgwTxzEFaa	None, unless your a business.<br>  <br>  They do not benefit the consumer.|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	Most companies are giving up leasing.|`|AA11357570	You paying for the car twice and even if you do total it, ur screwed!!!|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Other than lower monthly payments (usually) and the opportunity to get into a new car every two to three years, nothing when it comes to personal leases. Now, leases aren't popular because of the economy; in recent years, automakers, when pushing leases, misjudged the residual values on cars, and so got hosed in the process.<br>  <br>  However, if you're leasing a vehicle for business purposes, then it's worth your while, because it helps your bottom line.<br>  <br>  I'm not totally dead-set against automobile leases per se, because of the benefits they would bring to the table in the case of a business. However, owing to my own personal experiences, I steadfastly try to discourage people from getting a personal lease.|`|zN8ulzE2aa	well the fact that you get a new car, or have the option to buy it out and you can get rid of it at the end of your agreement with no loss or gain is pretty nice.

oCwi3aU7aa	This is a very strange problem, It could be a lot of things.  Stalling out during driving to me sounds like a fuel problem, either a clogging filter or a fuel pump that is on its way out.<br>  <br>  Those would be my first to suspects.  Since it is fuel injected you can check the fuel pressure, but you will have to know what it is suppose to be probably in the area of 30 - 40 psi but should only drop about 5 psi with the engine running.  <br>  <br>  If it is lower than that you have found your problem is somewhere in the fuel system so you will have to go through and check components such as the pressure regulator, the filter, the pump and the lines to make sure they are not pinched.<br>  <br>  hope this helps solve your problem<br>  good luck|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Your best bet would be to take the car to an auto repair shop for a diagnoses.

i1B1TBgFaa	It depends on how much power you want to make out of the engine and how long you want it to last. You can put a turbo on the stock engine but depending on the mileage of the vehicle and how much power you want it to hold will determine if you need to rebuild it. No matter what you do it will shorten the life of the engine and if it is a high mileage engine you will probably burn up you piston rings pretty fast. If you want to make good reliable power than you will want to replace the rods and consider putting in some low compression pistons. But this is just in the bottom end. Dont forget fuel management and your fuel system or it wont run at all. Then you will need to get it tuned. You will also have to upgrade your complete drivetrain to be able to hold the power. If you plan on dropping some serious cash go turbo. But dont think once you buy that turbo kit that your car will be set to go.
EjTikPNcaa	The flashing check engine light is cause for concern as it means there is something seriously wrong.  You should stop driving it immediately and get it to the dealer.  You have 5 years, unlimited miles roadside assistance for the tow (1-800-243-7766).  Unless they can prove it was operator error, any repair like this would be covered by the warranty.<br>  Get it to the dealer as soon as you can.|`|uhBxsmNtaa	You likely have a misfire in the engine, and the noise you are hearing might be your catalytic converter.

x8YFI6O4aa	I agree with most of the answers so far, however what you really need is to find a good honest detail shop/or body shop. They will go over the cars finish and its problems with you. Take the time to look at your car from every angle and in direct light, sun light is best, flouresent light works great!. <br>  <br>  A good detailer/polisher is going to use atleast a three stage process on car with these problems. Regardless of product name brand, it should start out agressive, some sanding and heavy polishing, then move to a lighter polish and then a final swirl remover polish. the art is in knowing where to start and when to stop!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you have had a bad polish/buffing job. Some waxes and polishes will hide the "swirl marks" created by an inexperienced operator. So when you pick the car up it looks great... A week or two later when you go through the car wash the high pressure removes a layer of the wax/polish and you see the marks left by the machine. Polishing a car is an art, it takes time and experience to get it right. Wet sanding, and painting should be the last resort unless the car is completely covered in deep swirls and scratches. Get it done right, then take care of the finish by hand washing and going to touchless car washes only. <br>  <br>  Also to remove road salt, try a product specifcally meant for that job. the easer the stuff comes off, the less pressure you need to apply to the finish. This greatly reduces the chances of scratching. Also some of these products actually stop the road salt from being corrosive.  email me I will send you a link, and some info.|`|2uRhWQ8Yaa	get the car wet sanded at a detail shop but its gonna cost bout 150 bucks it will look like a new paint job after that polish and wax reguarly to keep it looking new|`|I0mP1xssaa	Black cars are the worst for showing paint imperfections (we owned one and swore never again, becuase all the little swirls and fine scratches drove us crazy).  A lot of dealers don't employ the highest quality detailers, and people running amuck with buffers can do more damage than you can imagine.  I always tell the dealers NOT to do any prep like detailing to my cars, I'd rather do it myself.  <br>  <br>  As far as fine, light swirls and scratches, the best you can do is probably hide them.  You can buy a DAP (dual action polisher) and try to work them out yourself (polishers are not like buffers and it's pretty hard to burn paint with one).  Or, you can follow a step by step detailing plan (check out: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/showcardetailing" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/showcardetailing</a> for a good step by step walk through) to do your best to hide the defects.  One thing I'll point out is that places like "touchless" car washes rarely are, and the people drying them at the end aren't using high quality, clean towels.  In the winter in the northern climates though, sometimes it's a better choice than doing it yourself.  We do use them with our daily driver, but don't have them dry the car-we keep a few microfiber towels in it and do it ourselves.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	No matter what product you use, the only way to eliminate the swirl marks and scratches is to have the car re-painted.

Tiph3lQcaa	Remember that the fan blade is moving a lot faster than the aircraft. The fan blade tips are probably supersonic at takeoff. So the bird isn't hitting the blades at 200 mph, it's hitting them at 600 mph.<br>  <br>  All engines are required to pass bird ingestion tests prior to certification. These are done with real birds (dead of course) that are fired at 200 mph into the inlet of an engine running at max throttle. Depending on the size of the bird, different levels of damage can be expected. I was running a small turbofan in a test cell once when a sparrow somehow got into the cell and was ingested before we could shut down. That caused very little damage (except to the sparrow). I have seen blades that were hit by a duck, and they were bent pretty badly. I would think that one or two geese would take out an engine entirely. You cannot design for all incidents, and the FAA has to draw the line somewhere by their testing requirements. If you design an engine that is heavy enough to ingest a goose, then someone will hit an ostrich.|`|AA10352420	Yes. all bird or other  flying objects cause this damage to the engines and there by cause accidents The engine explodes and cause fire|`|zlPAVkUBaa	yes it is, LoL.<br>  <br>  I don't understand it, but engine manufacturers decided to put the blender attachment after the compressor stage. How dumb is that?|`|AA11402617	Aircraft engines are rigorously tested during development and any new type of engine has to pass the "chicken test".  The "chicken test" involves firing a three pound dead chicken from a cannon into the intake of the engine while it's at full power.  The engine must ingest the bird without damage.  Three pounds is considered to be an average weight of birds. <br>  <br>  The recent incident on the Hudson river was caused by a bird entering the engine intake, in this case a goose, that was more than three times that weight.|`|o6uwV66jaa	I went to an Air Show in 2007..<br>  and they were flying the Thunder Birds..last show of the day, and a crow got sucked in threw one of the Thunder Birds turbinds and they had to call the Thunder Birds off.. because it was ''unable to fly''<br>  it really sucked because most people just want to see them..<br>  but ya it's very possible..|`|DvlwN9kdaa	--Depends on the size and number of the birds, and the impact speed.<br>  <br>  Try it.|`|ruenEu8Yaa	haha .... ur funny.   <br>  <br>  yes.  even though you "said because of A "bird"  (why is bird in quotes? lol)"|`|f312398220fe22f8bbeaa1457a68057faa	Yes, bird strike can disable/destroy a jet engine.<br>  Also, a bird could crash through the windscreen, entering the cockpit and possibly knocking out/disabling the pilot.<br>  Most windscreens/windshields are rated for bird strike. However, it's a little like the misnomer of a "bullet proof" vest, which there really is no such thing. They're really "bullet resistant", as there is a bullet big enough to penetrate it somewhere out there.<br>  Though engines and windscreens are bird strike rated, there is a limit.|`|aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa	Some birds, like pelican and cormorant, are known to swallow stones to help them be less buoyant so that can dive to catch fish. Those rocks don;t go to well through a jet engine. If one compressor blade gets cut off, then that blade also goes deeper and hits other blades in the next row, now it is no longer rock or bird VS metal blade, it is metal blade against metal blade.<br>  Jet engines are designed to be contained (i.e. to not explode) when a bird is ingested. But it does not have to keep running. For an engine to be able to survive a large bird and keep running, it would have to be massively over-designed, and as a result, would not work very well as it would be too heavy and inefficient.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Turn on your blender, get a long potato, and slam the potato into your blender as hard as you can.  Then buy a new blender.  The fact is that hitting a four pound bird at 200 miles per hour is not much different than hitting a four pound rock.|`|429770cb7e87248aee142afd2cf077ffaa	It is possible, birds are such a threat that the FAA does testing on all engines.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to see what a goose can do to an engine check out this vid on youtube of FAA testing|`|TzPofCDxaa	Yes. A bird strike can be very destructive to an engine.<br>  It does depend a bit on the size of the bird though.<br>  A sparrow will not have the same impact as a swan or a goose.|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Sure its possible, one airliner just proved it.|`|5dWLIicYaa	OH yes...very much....u call it a bird strike....<br>  The US Airways incident in Hudson river just proved it....!!
fbxqLErlaa	Quick note, Kawasaki KLR 650 do not use a quart of oil every 400 to 800 miles.  I own a KLR and this is my experience.  <br>  A good source of information pertaining to the KLR and the V-Strom in on the Adventure Rider website.<br>  Personally, depending on the type and amount of off road riding I would look for a Honda XR650R.  More powerful engine than the KLR.  <br>  If you do buy a KLR, I would install the 715cc kit.  More displacement and less vibrations due to the use of a forged piston verses the stock cast piston.  <br>  I also had the stock seat re-done for better comfort.  I am also 6'1".<br>  Time for me to head to work.<br>  Good Luck|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	Get a KTM 530EXC-R, it is a street legal enduro. I ride a 2001 KTM 520MXC, which has the same basic engine. My bike would absolutely destroy a KLR650 in any type of drag race, plus it is lighter and much better off road. I can't possibly think of an off road situation where I have thought my bike needed more power. The six speed trans allows my bike to cruise comfortably on the roads as well. I wouldn't take it on the expressway, but I would take it down a 55mph road without any worries.<br>  <br>  KTM makes a large line of street legal enduros. They make a 450, a 530, a 690, and a 950. I would look at the 530 and 690. The 530 is a much better off road bike than the 690 and the 690 is a better on-road bike than the 530.

Sounds like way to muck money for a air intake. If it was the intake manifold and you brought it back while under warranty then the selling dealer should cover it under warranty because the leaking intake manifold is a state inspection item and should have failed the inspection. When did the warranty run out on the vehicle? It is only March if you can prove the repair was needed while the vehicle was under warranty they may do something on a good will basis, try asking both dealerships and maybe one or both will work with you.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Depends on your height and what type of trail riding. I had an '05 230 and now ride/race a CRF250R but have spent some time on my friend's X model also. There really is no comparison between the bikes. The 250 is much taller so if you are under 5'7" it will feel very tall, especially in the woods. The 250 also has tons more power, not because of the extra 20cc but because it is a liquid-cooled race engine while the 230 is just a low output air-cooled trail bike engine. The 250 is about $3000 more like someone else mentioned but there is a reason for that, aluminum frame, liquid-cooled titanium valve race engine, race suspension with adjustable rebound and compression, etc. The 230 on the other hand is a very fun and dependable bike, it just won't be as fast, it is heavier and doesn't have great suspension. For casual trail riding it is a blast, but if you are doing fast and aggressive trail riding it is not the best choice. The X has kick and electric start while the 230 just has electric start, so there is always a chance of running the battery down trying to get the 230 started, especially if you have dropped it and it is flooded or whatever. It only takes a few good cranks to run the little battery down and if you are somewhere there is no hill to roll it off you are screwed.|`|JJsJaQjxaa	The 250X by far|`|pUYfE1Zraa	i'd rather have the 250 but it's like 3 k more so i'd probably go with the 230
a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Its probably the wheels.  I see all kinds of vibration problems with aftermarket wheels which don't fit properly|`|G0O1M5XZaa	Usually it means the wheels need balancing. I would get the wheels rebalanced. See a tyre place but don't let them rip you off.  Get an alignment but when my car vibrated (The torana i had) i got the wheels balanced and it fixed it. When it use to veer to the right or left I then knew it needed an alignment. m Let us know how you went.|`|aJtO7VZHaa	he is absolutely right i had the same problem and it wil also make ur tiers were out alot faser  do it as soon as you can|`|z8u8qFJeaa	When you raise OR lower a vehicle it changes ALL the alignment angles, you MUST get the alignment done.
jlUGIQV2aa	It doesn't make the car any faster by its self. It does improve aerodynamics a bit but the real reason people want their cars lower is for handling. The lower a car is the lower its centre of gravity will be and the more stable it is. Think about it: if you have a weight attached to a poll, the poll is going to tip over easier the higher the weight is on it. The same principal applies to cars.  So, lower cars "hug" the road better and that allows them to "go faster" but only because they can be kept in control at higher speeds. It does make a huge difference, but it's unrelated to the cars horsepower.<br>     Hope that helps!|`|DwMU437uaa	Ok that's not what makes the car fast the engine and tranny are what do that. All the suspension does is keep the car from bouncing a lot and gives it its center of gravity, like a camaro and suburban the camaro has really great handling at high speed while the suburban has a very high chance to flip on turn that are very small. The lower car really doesn't mean that it faster it just means it has less air grag and a lower center of gravity.|`|d20evTAwaa	im pretty shure that it wont make it faster it will just be more stable but im not 100% shure|`|R51YuJjFaa	aerodynamics, its more a question of stability, a car going fast is more stable when its low to the ground because it doesn't have air flying underneath it pushing it upward, that's why the supped up tall muscle cars wheelie when they take off|`|jo0ZHqFjaa	Just lowering the car makes the car slower. The reason you see low slung cars going fast is because the driver is driving fast and most probably they also souped up the engine.|`|0z5oESMSaa	Drag cars have very fast acceleration and top speed and are not setup to be super low. The suspension is setup to squat and go fast in a straight line. So you see, lower does not mean fast.|`|zMMQVb3eaa	it doesnt mean there faster if there low its just a lower center of gravity so they half *** stay on the road and dont flip back when there haulin ***
FA1l64EOaa	It entirely depends on where you go to college.  I know that you can earn a variety of pilot certifications from Daniel Webster College, Emery Riddle University and Liberty University.  If you want to be a Commercial Pilot, you need to go to a school which offers the ground school and license for one (I'm certain that Emery Riddle and Daniel Webster do).  But then, you need to get a number of hours under your belt and get checked out in commercial aircraft.  The life of a commercial pilot is a tough one especially for young pilots in the beginning.<br>  <br>  I earned my private when I was 19 and I did it on my own.  Saved up, paid an instructor and rented a small single engine aircraft.  My dad was a commercial pilot so he was my main source for my answer.  I hope this helps somewhat.|`|26d342c5c97d68129a08f71c5edaae04aa	any pilots licenses require that you take ground school and flight training.. if you want a bachelors in aviation... depending on the school it might give you the Commercial Pilots Licence and Airline Transport Pilots License, but 'Bachelor' indictates to me, and i may be wrong in this regard, that it's a business thing...

s8cZsSX0aa	Well you currently cant melt a car tire. However the university of Ohio is developing a way to break the special bonds of tire by using ultrasound. <br>  <br>  The problem with using heat, is that the tire catches fire before it hits its melting point, due to some kind of bond that is made during manufacture. <br>  <br>  Currently the only way to recycle used tires is to grind it into small peaices and use it as a filler material, like in concrete, or new tires, or as a fuel source for energy.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No you can't melt a tire.

DydFQ0fcaa	Generally speaking, parasitic loss is between 12-15% <br>  <br>  It all depends on your drivetrain set-up, amount of rotational mass you have to overcome etc.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	here is an interesting fact. the transmission does not loose power, it actually helps re-cooperate the  unused power form the previous cycle, by 2.2 times the engines capacity if i remember right.|`|aa9gieAIaa	i don't know the average loss though that specific trany but it will change with engine speed and the ratio of input to output likely. the higher the input speed the greater the loss is the general rule. with manuals the loss is greatest in the lower gears usually but with your 4 speed auto im not sure if the lower or higher ratios are less effecient.i would guess the lower gears would lose more with yours but i don't know. the rear end assembly loss and loss from tire friction will affect it too remember. you will never know what your engine is really putting to the wheels without a dyno though. all you can do is guess without one, even a "G meter" reading from your cab cant tell you very accurately unless you know the exact weight of the vehicle. the dyno is also the only good way to accurately examine the shape of the power curve comming from the engine/trans in every gear and adjust accordingly to smooth the rate of acceleration.

If you put any other speakers to it as well your dividing the power.
8lboONb2aa	The only problem I can think of off hand would be running these speakers on the same amp because for the sub you want to send a filtered signal which contains the lows to the sub but for the 6x9s you would want to send the full range signal. I haven't seen any amps which would allow you to do this. Usually they have low pass, high pass, and full spectrum settings. Also 3500W peak power 6x9s sounds insane, is that number correct?

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	A hybrid car is a car that is propelled by more than one energy source. Typically, when one is thinking of a hybrid car, it is usually a gasoline/electric hybrid, as that is what is currently available commercially. (There are diesel-electric concept cars (not in production), and there are diesel-electric locomotives, submarines, and heavy construction equipment...) Usually a dual-fuel vehicle, like a CNG-gasoline or LPG-gasoline vehicle isn't in the popular hybrid definition, but those are usually aftermarket-fitted anyways.<br>  <br>  How a hybrid car works depends on the technology that a manufacturer decided to use to make it a hybrid. Not all hybrids are created equal. <br>  <br>  As the lowest common denominator, hybrids usually have a larger electric motor (for starting the gasoline engine or for charging the hybrid battery), larger/additional hybrid battery pack to drive the electric motor, auto-stop (gasoline engine turns off at idle), regenerative braking (coasting or light braking will cause the motor to act as a generator, capturing some of that lost kinetic energy of wheel motion and storing it as electricity in the hybrid battery), improved fuel economy, and lower emissions.<br>  <br>  More improved hybrid systems allow for tuning for higher performance (more power or acceleration), or for more fuel efficiency (usually through using a smaller engine, where the electric motors help out). On the more improved hybrid systems, you could see:<br>  - ability to act as a standing generator to power equipment off-site<br>  - additional peak power, by the electric motor assisting the gasoline engine as required (for acceleration or hill climbing, for example), similar to a turbo<br>  - electric-only propulsion (short periods of the electric motors/hybrid battery alone powering the car, for low power requirements (such as coasting, driving on the level, low speeds)<br>  - reduction in weight and ability to move accessories from belt-driven to electrically-driven (smaller wires needed)<br>  <br>  The Ford/Mercury/Mazda hybrid system and the Nissan hybrid system is fairly similar to the older Toyota THS system (seen on the 2001-2003 Prius). Toyota/Lexus hybrids are currently using the THS-II or HSD (Hybrid Synergy Drive) system. Honda is using their IMA (Integrated Motor Assist) hybrid system. GM's newer hybrids are using their BAS (belt-alternator system) or two-mode system, while their older "hybrid" pickups are pretty much the lowest common denominator listed above.<br>  <br>  For general overviews:<br>  <a href="http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-center-how-hybrid-cars-work-under-the-hood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-cente...</a><br>  <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question262.htm" rel="nofollow">http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question26...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/hybrid-car.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.howstuffworks.com/hybrid-car....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/hybridtech.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/hybridtec...</a><br>  <br>  The problem is that not all hybrids are created equal. There are different hybrid technologies, depending on manufacturer. Even among the same manufacturer, you can find one model tuned for performance (power and acceleration) with only a slight fuel efficiency improvement, compared to another for fuel efficiency and emissions. (See the Honda Accord Hybrid vs. Honda Civic Hybrid, or the Lexus models compared to their sister Toyota models...)<br>  <br>  With so many different technologies and implementations all called a "hybrid," no wonder you are confused!|`|0z5oESMSaa	Depends on the type of hybrid setup but there is always an electric motor powered by the battery which drives the wheels in addition to the normal internal combustion engine.

bqLvWpcZaa	Lowering springs are cheaper but if you install only the springs, they will usually shorten the life of the stock shocks/struts.  <br>  <br>  Coilovers are more expensive but they are adjustable.

KuWLNfYbaa	If it was ok before you changed the fuse then you must have disturbed some main ignition starter connection wire while changing the fuse. As it wont start on a push and your starter doesn't operate then check your solenoid and relay connections.The starter and ignition are not normally on a fuse but check other fuses nearby which may be connected to an isolator unit.Check that you have current at the starter solenoid large terminal all the time and that you have current at the solenoid small push on terminal when the ignition key is turned to the starter position.If you havent current at either one of these ,trace back until you find the problem|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Bad starter?|`|aJtO7VZHaa	diff sounds like ur starter. check ur starter. then make shear ur connection is good there should be a wire going to your battery if that is all good then take ur steering calm of and make shear the wire for ur starter is still connected it will say st1 or st2 there is 5 wiers that go to your ignition so look and see if anything looks like it mite have a problem.thats all i can thank of so fartell me what you fined out.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	A car needs 3 things to run 1) fuel 2) air 3) spark if you have power to the starter and it still don't fun you need to check these 3 things.

TdrgZwnoaa	The other driver is clearly at fault and the cop (while being an ***) is essentially correct. You have nothing to worry about with your insurance or if this goes to court. The other drive did deliberately go into a lane they had no right to be in and did cause the collision with your vehicle. <br>   What the cop said has no bearing at all since he chose to charge the other driver and not you.<br>   Any court will plainly see that you had no reason to expect a car to be coming up upon you from the opposing traffic lane.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Since the driver was cited for the accident the driver's insurance should still cover the damages.  As for you, you should "always" check your blind spots.  No matter what the situation, if you are making a move into traffic always check the blind spots.  The officer was correct in this sense, because you should have looked before you moved.  In this case both of you were at fault for this.  The other driver was at fault because they did not check to make sure that the passage way was clear and they hit you in the side.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Well you should always check your blind spot, just for stupid people like the one that hit you.   But you just need to place a claim in on the other persons insurance company. If they don't have insurance, then small claims court. The judge will be able to determine who was at fault.|`|wpgRMjgraa	You wont have any problems because this was the other drivers fault and as stated above you do need to always check and never assume but at the end of the day its their fault....make sure that you make a statement about this with your insurance company ASAP.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Just put in a claim to the other driver's insurance or ask your own insurance to put in the claim for you. If you have collision coverage, which you probably do for a 2008 car, you can put in a claim to your own insurance after paying your deductible and your own insurance will go after the other driver's insurance (or the other driver if she doesn't have insurance) and when they collect, you'll get your deductible back. <br>  <br>  From your description of the accident, it sounds like there wasn't a center turn lane? Or if there was a center turn lane that you were in, then the other driver is just more stupid for trying to go around you. The cop has a valid point of always checking your blind spot. I always check my mirror/blind spot before moving in the center turn lane to make sure someone else isn't there, but I never think of checking in this situation because there shouldn't be someone in an oncoming traffic lane. Did you have on a turn signal?

rY4tjyCOaa	Although I agree with the other answers there is another element to be<br>   Considered... "Top Gear did a comparison of braking distances for all<br>   New cars(a few years ago) which demonstrated vast Differences in the<br>   Efficiency of their braking systems, Up to 60% if I remember rightly!<br>    This obviously means that a driver's understanding of a safe distance<br>    to leave when driving behind another vehicle will be compromised <br>    unless the driver has accurate knowlege of the braking figuers for all<br>    Vehicles Which is virtually impossible. Especially when one factors in<br>    Purposely upgraded brakes,Fair wear and tear reductions in efficiently,<br>    Types of road surface, conditions of road surface etc. Maybe All <br>    Manufacturers should highlight these comparisons as widely as they<br>    have to describe their vehicles wonderful fuel performances, Because<br>       LIVES depend on them getting the braking system efficient As<br>    Opposed to saving a few bob on fuel. What say you folks?.  T.V.Idiot|`|4uf044sFaa	I know it's frustrating, but no matter the circumstances, if you hit someone from behind, you are at fault.  If you had been paying attention and given a proper distance from the car in front of you, the wreck probably wouldn't have happend.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Based on the information given and by your own admission, you were previously aware of the difficulty that this person was in and assumed she would do the correct thing. You should have been prepared for the alternatives and your were not. You should have been asking yourself '''what if ? ''', but you freely chose to ignore the problem and the subsequent consequences.<br>  <br>   The fault is entirely yours. Sorry, but defencive driving experts are continually trying to drive home the point that we should always be aware of our surroundings and be prepared for the unexpected.|`|XLXncQu9aa	The other driver is not responsible because you hit a driver from behind.  It doesn't matter what she did so much, but since you hit another driver from behind you are automatically at fault.  So whoever hits a driver from behind, that person is deemed at fault.  Your insurance should cover the damages.|`|f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	only hearing your side I would say you are at fault. Everyone needs to be a defensive driver and be ready for anything that happens in front of them<|`|HDK10qYZaa	in a car accident if you rear end someone no matter what the cause is your at fault for following to close.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Well, that's odd that the police women said that. Maybe it was just to scare her not to stop like that again if she had a chance to get off of the road. I don't know why she wouldn't be responsible since nobody died, but just because the cop said she would doesn't mean the court would agree and criminal charges are different than determining fault of accident with no injures. But anyway, the bottom line is if you were following with a safe following distance, you should of been able to stop in time. So, that's why it's always the driver that's from behind at fault. The lead car could stop for any reason, such as to avoid hitting an animal, and if the lead car sudden slows down or stops, the cars behind should be prepared to do the same.|`|XixWPZZsaa	It is your fault intirely and this is why:<br>  <br>  There is a good reason that one of the very first basics of good and safe driving is to maintain your safety zone, it is also a traffic law everywhere. When you travel too close you simply forget that if anything should happen, it will be very quick and will require your proper reaction and to properly react you need to have enough room so YOU could manage. It is very common for untrained drivers (who are a vast majority) to drive relying on the fact that nothing will be happening, and when a situation strikes - you have no time to react.<br>  <br>  They say two full seconds is the least space you should have between you and the car in front. That is if you have both hands on the steering wheel and will react in milliseconds. More than 89% of drivers will require more than 1 second to react, so the 2 second rule is not good enough for everyone.....and you just learned your lesson.
0H33hKJmaa	Depends on a few things. A Jetta, whether high miles or not is a little on the expensive side for maintenance. My '97 VW Golf (a less expensive model) requires all synthetic fluids, so an oil change costs me almost $90 bucks every few thousand miles. The transmission, which is recommended to be serviced every 60K miles is no different, only the trans fluid is almost $16/quart and must be purchased from Volkswagen, so it's in the neighborhood of $300-$400 with an hours worth of labor depending on the shop.<br>  Oh yeah, the labor on these guys; most shops in my town won't do a lot of work on my car. Much more than a brake job, or alignment and I'm paying $75 bucks an hour at an import shop. <br>  Now, I don't know what kind of money you're prepared to spend on a vehicle, and I won't tell you that these aren't great cars well capable of driving far beyond 200 or even 300K miles...BUT if you're driving a car that can be a wee on the spendy side to take care of anyway, I would suggest looking for one with a little less miles just in case the engine doesn't last much longer or will need really expensive work in the near future.<br>  Best of luck to you, and I hope that you get the right car (whichever one it is).|`|N4BFdAdJaa	Hello. That sounds like a nice car if you can get it for really cheap. The average person would think that 200,000 miles is way too much, but actually, on a VW it is not. I know someone who has a 2000 jetta with 250,000 miles and going. She has owned it since new and taken very good care of it. Those cars will run forever if the proper maintenance is done to them. If the timing belt has been replaced again, then you have a car that's good for another 100 thousand miles as long as it runs good now. Good luck.|`|NMNfvAj9aa	VW/Audi's last forever if properly maintained and not abused. well almost any car can last 300k+ if properly maintained.

Best I've managed is 194K with an Audi 100 1800cc (same engine design as the Jetta).

That is a lot of miles on a car. You could find something with less miles on it. Remember, not just the engine, but transmission/transaxle, differential, and cooling system are all exposed to wear and tear due to mileage.<br>  <br>  I will say this: If I were to buy a vehicle with 200,000 miles on it, a German vehicle would be on the top of my list because they are generally very reliable. The Jetta has been considered a very reliable vehicle over the years.|`|gsjjiRGFaa	hafta agree with jesse...how much will it cost you to get in the door? it's kind of like a strip club: you hafta keep payin' to keep playin'.|`|nfdlPfdQaa	Look up the blue book value on a 97 Jetta in excellent condition.

paBZp7dwaa	This is really a matter of opinion as each are very different to drive.<br>  it also depends on what your looking for because if your looking for a fast 4x4 its probably the porsche or the merc. however if you are looking for an off roading 4x4 then i would have to say the audi.<br>  comfort would be the merc or the BMW.

5eHSijrWaa	You do not give a weight but over 7.5 tons you need a tacho.  You also seem to be confusing the Driving hours regs with the working hours regs.  If you are purely driving then you can only do so for 4.5 hrs and then you must take a break of 45 mins.  You can split this break but effectively only into one break of 15 mins and one of 30 mins as the regs say that the second break must be at least 30 mins.<br>  <br>  You must also obey the Working Hours Directive.  This says that you must take a break of 30 mins for a working period of 6 hours.  That means that if you drive for 3 hours and then carry out other work such as rounding up horses or cleaning the vehicle etc. for 3 hours then you have to take a break of at least 30 mins.<br>  <br>  By now you are probably like a lot of us - totally confused.

0Kcd8Dkyaa	The clutch fluid is fed from the brake fluid reservoir. So yes it could well be your clutch that's causing the fluid loss.<br>  But the design of the system means the brakes wont fail since the take off for the clutch is halfway up the reservoir. so even if the clutch loses all its fluid the brakes will still work.<br>  <br>  Edit: to all answerer's who say the brake and clutch systems are separate they are incorrect since most cars share the same fluid reservoir, although the high pressure side is obviously separate<br>  Eg all Vauxhalls and Fords !|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Cluch fluid is separate.You have a leak and there is air in the system.Change the slave and master cylinder washers and bleed the clutch|`|HMgRFOhqaa	Are you losing fluid? if not then it's probably master cyl.

7L0zp7O6aa	Just don't pay over sticker.  Some pay a lot less and some don't.  It depends on the demand in your region.  As long as you know no two people pay the same amount for the same car so don't worry so much about over paying as long as you can afford the car.  The car is worth what Subaru charges for them so anything you get under that is a bonus.  Just don't pay more.  Call all the dealers in your state and the surrounding states and see if any of them are willing to make a great deal.  If it costs you $500 in travel expense but you save $2000, it's worth it.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Considering that those cars are very much in demand, it is going to be difficult to get much of a break on the price. Do your homework. Go to kbb.com and look up the dealer invoice price of the car and try to stay at that figure. Keep getting up to walk out if they will not come down on the price. You will know when they have reached their final price. If you head out the door and they don't chase you, they aren't going to budge any more. Good luck!

i1ayj8enaa	There are a lot of reasons that your amp is going into protection. It could be outside of it's safe current or voltage ratings. But, I would imagine that the root cause of the problem is the gain and bass boost settings on the amp. Having the gain set too high can cause a lot of problems with your system. It can also shorten the lifespan of the amp. Your gain settings are only made to be set one time. <br>  <br>  There are a couple different methods that work well. By ear isn't one of them. The most common method is to use a Digital Multimeter to set the gain and boost. <br>  <br>  You'll need a few tools. A Digital Multimeter and a 50hz test tone. <br>  Here's a quick explanation...<br>  <br>  1.) Calculate the target output voltage. It's a pretty simple equation.<br>  Output Voltage = the square root of RMS wattage X the Final ohm load. <br>  Example: 1000 W RMS X 2 Ohms = 2000 <br>  And, the square root of 2000 is 44.72. In this example, 44.72 is the target output voltage. <br>  <br>  2.) Set all of the controls for the bass, on the head unit and the amp, to zero. ( gain, boost, bass control)<br>  3.) Disconnect the subs<br>  4.) Turn off, or disconnect the mid and high range speakers in the car. <br>  5.) With the engine running, pop in the 50hz test tone, on repeat, and crank the volume to about 3/4 of the head unit's capacity. If it goes to 40, turn it to 30. This is usually the point just before the signal will start to degrade.<br>  6.) Set the Multimeter to AC voltage. Then see what you get for an output. <br>  7.) Slowly turn up the gain, boost, and bass,  until you reach your target voltage. On most amps, this is the point just before the amp starts to clip. Clipping causes distortion. Which will cause a ton of problems. Including the one that you have now. <br>  8.) Turn down the volume and eject the test tone CD from the head unit. <br>  9.) Turn everything off. <br>  10.) Reconnect everything.<br>  <br>  Now that you're done, there are a few thing to keep in mind. You know have a clean signal going to the amp. If you go turning the bass or the boost up. the amp will start to clip again. Then, you're in the same boat the you are now. There's no reason to go dirtying up a clean signal. Use these settings as a threshold. <br>  <br>  That's it. 10 easy steps to having your system set up right. I know it sounds like a lot of work. But, it's worth it. I can almost guarantee that, if you haven't already damaged the amp, it's a good start to fixing the problem.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ux0wBOpcaa	hey if you have a face plate that you can take off on your head unit then when it shuts off just take the face plate off then put it back on again...the you don't have to shut your car off... but i think its doing that because your not getting enough power to your amp..what size amp do you have and what gauge wire do you have? that used to happen to me when i had a 6 gauge wire hooked up to a 2000 watt then i switched to a 4 gauge and it never happend again.. it could also be your amp overheating.....|`|bpwehYLaaa	Your amp is probably shuting down cause of it overload protection feature.Make sure the amp and subs your using are compatible. To do this simply see how many watts of RMS power your amp puts out per channel and make sure its not more then what the subs max RMS power handling is. Also make sure your using a strong enough gauge power wire(I recommended atleast 4 gauge power wire). Another couple things to check are to make sure you have a good solid ground connection and that your subs/amp are running the same ohm's.|`|q0GuI6oraa	One thing that many people do wrong that causes their amp to go into protect mode is that they wire the subs up at the wrong impedance.<br>  <br>  if your amp is only stable at 4 ohms and your subs are wired at 2 ohms this could cause the amp to become unstable and kick over into protect mode. <br>  <br>  I would say this is the number 1 problem I see most generally when people have their amps kicking off.

Then, you will notice a significant performance and mileage gain.  <br>  Most people notice WORSE mileage from just the exhaust mods since it sounds SO GOOD, you're on the gas more.... <br>  NOTE: You will get better horsepower and mileage with the 3 mods... 10-15% if you don't lead-foot it too much.|`|3920585b81bbc69ee625f1dd627a1394aa	No. It did not help my '03 Dodge Ram 4x4 Quadcab (4.7 liter 5 speed).

Each time the spark jumps across a gap, an electromagnetic field is created that can interfere with radio signals. By placing a resistor in the spark plug, we can substantially reduce RFI. Furthermore, the use of non-resistor plugs with today's complex computer systems can result in driveability problems, loss of performance and can even cause the computer to store trouble codes."|`|3e92a4f3282988ecf044b1d36b73fc92aa	With no resistors there is extra sparking. Like an arc being struck instead of just one spark jumping. This burns the electrode of the plug faster. It also creates a lot of radio interference from the wires. The other item to control this spark and prevent excess arcing is a capacitor on the ignition coil.|`|12bf74a84450cf01ed6e595d9a263fc4aa	To stop external interference|`|1a4774c258bafb4f4aaaa747343a4d00aa	BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH ELECTRICAL CHARGE RUNNING THRU THEM EFFECTSRADIO/TV TRANSMISSIONS AND OTHER SENSITIVE ELECTRCAL CURRENTS.|`|9761f33cf986f14deabf5af1a9bfaa24aa	The resistors have 2 functions.

4n2YACSCaa	Io ho un'Alfa 147 e mi ci trovo benissimo, anzi se te la devo dire tutta è migliore della Golf....<br>  Un mio amico aveva il primo modello della 147 ora l'ha cambiata e ha preso l'Audi A3 Sportback e ha detto che si trovava meglio prima con la 147....<br>  Ultimamente la Fiat ha fatto grossi passi avanti soprattutto nelle linee, basta guardare la Grande Punto, la nuova Bravo e la futura 500...<br>  I crash test della Fiat risultano ottimi, sia la Grande Punto, la Croma e la Bravo hanno ricevuto 5 stelle...<br>  Penso che la Fiat ha trovato la strada giusta per cercare di essere competitiva con le rivali tedesche e giapponesi...<br>  Poi i giudizi sui modelli sono soggettivi, ora che la Bravo la vedo più spesso di prima, se la guardo bene non mi piace moltissimo soprattutto dietro... <br>  Comunque è soggettivo sennò compreremmo tutti la stessa macchina!!!|`|aizCQVmWaa	FIAT sai cosa compri e sopratutto come ti frega.|`|03bacfb878f804134bee90b70180edcbaa	sicuramente sono auto ben fatte e il successo nelle vendite lo dimostra. Ovviamente i tedeschi  sono ancora un gradino sopra, non per niente costano significativamente di più. Sno sicuramente all'altezza delle francesi e delle americane (essenzialmente la Ford, che comunque fa tutto in Germania).<br>  Personalmente ritengo la nuova Bravo la più bella della sua categoria!!|`|BQvmfMjXaa	Veramente ridicole!|`|Wgm2Y6hTaa	ciao lavorando nei ricambi d auto posso dirti che ce molto mercato nei ricambi fiat..sembra qsi ke se rompono spesso...ma nn è cosi .<br>  kmq le usltime makkine a detta di amici e fornitori sono molto avanti rispetto alle macchine fiat di sempre.<br>  per esempio la sedici e la punto e anche la panda  sono quelle che vanno di piu almeno cosi per ora sembra ;)|`|tGTJTsHkaa	sono curiosa di vedere dal vivo la nuova 500 perché dalle immagini che ho visto è veramente carina..poi per il resto la penso come te mi spiace ma nonostante tutto non è competitiva con le straniere|`|4MFEqeoaaa	la nuova punto e molto carina l`alfa 147 anche se non e` nuovissima mi piace molto complimenti in casa fiat|`|5J74wAPwaa	Io non comprerò MAI una FIAT.|`|VHG8zae3aa	Sono fantastiche!! una migliore dell'altra... i motori sono i migliori... paragonate il 1.4 diesel della VW che è a tre cilindri, e un 1.3 multijet fait... la differenza altro che abissale.. il multijet batte il motore wv senza neanche accorgersene...<br>  Inoltre non credo che le auto del gruppo fiat siano tanto inferiori alle tedesche... prendete alfa 159, 147, brera,  lancia musa, ypsilon, fiat croma, punto, bravo, PANDA, 16, ulisse... Sono tutte tra le auto più vendute.. (forse ad esclusione di della 16 e della brera, la prima perchè ha uno stile particolare ed è un prodotto di nicchia, la seconda perchè è puramente sportiva e con quello che ne comporta) ma ad esempio la ypsilon e la punto, con i motori multijet specialmente sono le auto più vendute tra le utilitarie (ed il mercato automobilistico è basato principalmente sulle utilitarie) Sul mercato dell'usato sono introvabili, 147, che vende sempre di più nonostante sia vicina al "pensionamento" alfa 159 che nonostante non costi proprio pochissimo vende che è una meraviglia, la bravo uscita da pochi mesi ne vedi già a migliaia. Insomma, non diciamo ca***te  ultimamente le auto italiane sono tra le migliori..  le tedesche a mio parere sono a un passo.. basta vedere tutti i problemi che danno ultimamente ad esempio le mercedes e quelli che danno le auto italiane.. e poi, permettetemi un appunto estetico, nonostante ritengo sia personale.. prendete la bravo e prendete la golf... non mi verrete a dire che la seconda è bella?? l'altro giorno ho visto su un giornale che stanno già realizzando la nuova serie di golf perchè quest'ultima non vende e non piace.. secondo me un motivo c'è,... mi fermo perchè altrimenti faccio notte.|`|s7w0ZQBSaa	Qualunque siano i grandi passi resterà sempre una macchina per poveracci|`|w32eJ9Czaa	un parere da uno che lavora su tutte le marche di automobili: <br>  Sicuramente le nuove vetture di casa fiat sono migliorate<br>  vedi nuova punto, croma, alfa 159, brera , lancia musa,Y.<br>  Queste (lancia )escluse sono costruite in collaborazione con la General Motors e utilizzano pianali, e meccaniche Opel.<br>  un buon salto in avanti per Fiat , ma ancora distante per raggiungere le vetture tedesche!Provate i motori V W tdi<br>  e motori jtd i primi sicuramente vi daranno più soddisfazione!

If reliability is a big thing for you, you are never - ever - going to beat Honda, and their build quality is better than anyone else's.<br>  <br>  As a learner, you have to do a day's CBT training (around ￡100) before you can ride legally on the roads.
