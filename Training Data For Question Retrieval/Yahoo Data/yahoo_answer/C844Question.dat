My friend and I are starting a limited liability partnership (LLP) and are looking at our options for a business account.  I know he has bad credit,  and he says he was reported to the Chex System (I think that's what its called) for owing some money on one of his accounts two years ago.  He currently has a good standing account at WaMu however. What are we to expect when we try to open a business checking account (or other accounts) under our business name? I just don't know what to expect and I would also greatly appreciate any good suggestions.  Thank you all.

I was offered a new job and agreed to start work six months later. Since then, I have been trying to get the HR to prepare my contract and was constantly told by them that the contract is not ready. Two days before my actual start day, I emailed the HR again and once again, they told me that the contract is not ready. After then, I tried to email them several times but they did not reply me at all. Since I do not have a contract, I did not report work on the planned first day. If the company do not want to offer me a job, they should tell me instead of making me wait. However, instead of apologizing, both the HR and my new boss blamed me for not turning up for work without informing them. And because of this, they actually think that I am a very irresponsible person not sincere in the job. At the moment, I am still waiting for the HR to reply to my email regarding the status of the contract. What should I do?

20090202231155AA1zkwf	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Filed tax return then got another w2 in the mail. what do I do? ?	I filed my tax return a couple days ago with turbotax. at the time i filed I thought I only had 1 w2. however I forgot that there was a place i worked at the beginning of 08 that I had forgot about. so I was expecting only one w2 and that's why I filed with only one. but now I have another one and I would like to add it to my return but turbotax gives me a way smaller return when I enter it in. I only made 32k and my return should be way more than 1000. including the tuition reimbursement. before I entered my additional w2 in turbotax my refund estimator said it was 1375. now why would it go down to 1000 if I added an additional 8k to my salary? i'm single no dependants.

I know I owe them and have been making payments on most of the bills.  I qualify for an exemption from garnishment, due to the fact that we are now a low income family with 2 kids.  Thanks Economy!  I have this one lawyer that is trying to collect on the largest bill which is $7000 and won't accept small monthly payments, which is already hard to afford, cause I am already paying other bills for the same surgery.  The lawyer is threatening to take me to court to get a judgment against me if I don't agree to make higher payments.  There were several bills for the surgery and I can't afford to pay them all large payments, just small ones.  The other collectors/lawyers are working with me and I have been making them small monthly payments for a while now.  I was wondering if they have to accept smaller monthly payments or can they still take me to court? Can they take my state (Minnesota) or federal taxes?  And how long they can try to garnish for a judgment?

20070714164704AAB94sp	Business & Finance;Investing	What is interest when it says "Compounded and applied monthly?	I am looking into opening a money market account.  I haven't spoken with the bank yet directly because I am deployed and in Iraq.  It states in the description of the account that "Interest is compounded weekly and applied monthly".      Does this mean, say I invest 10,000, at 3% interest my first month would generate 300, and my second month would generate 303, thus at the end of two months I would have 10,603?      I keep searching for calculators online, and every calculator I can find only applies interest yearly, so at the end of 12 months the calculator is showing an total savings of 10,300 for a 3% interest.      My confusion comes in when I notice that all over the web all I am able t find is interest applied yearly, but the wording on my banks money market account hints that it is in fact, applied monthly.      Can anyone explain this process to me, and if there is a calculator on the web that would be useful, please point me to it?      Thanks!

I want to buy a house on my street as a primary residence and rent out my own house but bank/underwriter requested a written statement WHY I want to move into that house as opposed to the one I already live in since both are same in size.     My major motivation is that price is lower for the house I am buying, I can take advance of lower price and it has better interior design.   Otherwise bank wants to see it as an investment property rather than primary home which increases my mortgage rate, down payment, and everything.      How to convince a bank that it's going to be my primary home? Is such letter request common?  Thanks.
20070717233550AAHs3EA	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Building a house while in college?	I am rooming with 3 other people for my sophmore year in college.  I am kind of disappointed that my rent money isn't being spent on a house.  Is it possible to partner up with 2 of my roommates and all take out a loan to finance a new house?  Granted, we are already in debt from school and have some loans out already for it.  But, we do work and could pay some of it off.  I figured this would take place over next summer or maybe taking a year off(would use this year for planning).  I understand the task at hand and the risks/rewards.  How much would it cost to build in the Orlando, FL area for about ~2000sq. ft.? We would do all the work besides laying the concrete etc... we would do the interior mostly.        Possible or out of the question?

20070729212509AAfRTBP	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I am having trouble understanding the flex100 program for no money down.?	Is this considered an interest only loan? My concern is that the broker states there is 6.5 interest rate on 30 year fixed with LPMI. I do not understand the difference between LPMI and PMI. Would it be better to just have the PMI and have it removed once the loan is paid off 20% or more. Is the LPMI for the life of the loan? Also with the flex 100 can you pay the loan amount just as fast if we were to have a 95% conventional loan. Are there prepayment penalties usually associated with this loan if we decide to pay every 2 weeks. Please help...really confused about the whole process. It is very hard to trust the loan officers here in atlanta. Thanks.

I live in Illinois and I'm trying to get a Home equity line of credit to do some needed work on my house.  After dealing with my mortgage company on the phone, everything looked good, and then today they informed me that the state of Illinois no longer allows "lines of credit secured by real estate."  When I asked him, he confirmed that it is the state, not the company's rule.  He then attempted to sell me a 40 year mortgage at 9.5% interest, which would put me at around 95% of my equity.  Right now, I'm at 6.5% and about 65% equity.  (needless to say, the answer will be a NO).  My credit is decent and I have a good debt to income ratio.  I don't beleive what he said about Illinois not allowing them and I can't find any information to confirm it.  Is this true?  Thanks

20070809132653AAGKBT5	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can you sell a house before the financing goes through? Is this legal?	There is a house for sale. It has an accepted offer on it but subject to financing by the 15th. I have a backup offer on it if the financing doesn't go through, which is accepted as well. Now the people who have the first accepted offer on it have the house listed privately now in the paper. There financing still isn't through and they wouldn't get possession until the 1st of sept.It seems s though they are trying to sell it even before the financing goes through. How can you sell the house if you don't even have the financing in place yet. She said something about selling the contract? Does this make sense. I've read about it but I didn't think it was legal in canada.  I faked that I hadn't seen the house before and went to see it again through the first offer people and they had jacked the price up 20K to 87,500! Are they legally allowed to show a house thy don't have possesion to? Can you legally sell or trasfer over the conract or whatever before you even own it? I dont get it.

Lines of credit is Auto, Installment and 2 revolving credit cards. Middle score was 634 but dropped because of to many inquiries searching for a mortgage loan. DTI around 30%. But they was quoted on the GFE of 90% LTV at 10% and on 95% LTV at 11%. With the way the market is today and lenders tightening standards and squeezing borrowers out with these scores. What do you suggest    1. Take the deal before you can't get a loan and refinance later after your score continue to rise.      2. Take a chance on finding another lender (which may be impossible in todays market.      3. Wait it out. But his lease on a townhome he has been renting for 2 years is up Sept. 15th.

I'm 14 and I dropped a resume off at a local fruit and fresh store  and the next day I went in to get fruit and asked if he got it, he said yes but he lost it, so I told him some achievements and stuff and he told me can train me that day      I did the training with someone who was 16 and had been working there 2 years.

20090203002819AAkUstZ	Business & Finance;Corporations	Can Abercrombie & Fitch get in a lot of trouble for spaying their fragrance so much?	If you have been in this store lately, then you must have noticed that the scent of their signature fragrance is stronger than ever before.      They recently installed these black fragrance boxes on the ceiling that mists Fierce continuously for 40 minutes (or something like that). There have already been many complaints to the company, but apparently nothing is being done. Employees experience worse allergies and doctors have even recommended that they quit their job because they can't breathe! But that's beside the point...      Despite receiving many complaints, Abercrombie & Fitch are too cheap to remove the fragrance boxes because they just installed them. When complaints are filed, nobody listens or seems to care. Employees are told to just "suck it up and deal with it" by their district managers. What can be done?

I am very upset because we have been working for months and months with an insurance agent regarding our liability, compensation, and employee benefits insurance. everytime we thought we were going to be given a quote the agent would need more information. We finally did find another agent who is currently working on getting us a quote too (the other still hasn't come through) we were looking for some very specific things so it made it a little difficult to find the perfect agent hence why we chose the one we did and why it took so long to find another one. my question is about how much should the liability and compensation run us? we have about 15 employees at the moment one RN the other 10 are CNA or personal care aides. 4 are office staff (one being myself and my partner who is my mother, our office administrator, HR coordinator, and our program coordinator) any info would be very helpful thanks

20090203013012AAn1gf6	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I took a 401k loan, and my payroll deductions never started.  Now my loan has defaulted. What can I do?	I took a loan against my 401k, and used the money to buy stock in an offering my company was giving.  I got a 60% match on my stock purchase, so I wanted to maximize that match.  I set up the loan to take the money out of my paycheck for 52 weeks.  The problem is, they never deducted the money.  After a few weeks I called my 401k provider and they said to wait longer and then contact my company HR.  I contacted my company HR and they said to talk to the 401k company.  Shortly thereafter I got a notice to pay the amount owed in full or it would default.  I couldn't pay off the amount and it defaulted, now I owe 40% on my taxes.  Is there anyway I can make payments on a defaulted loan to reduce the tax impact?

Dear Friend,      As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I    believe everyone will die someday. My name is Bhai Patek a merchant in    India.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all    forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months    to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my    life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but    my business.       Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to    people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared    for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life    than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe    when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my    life a different way from how I have lived it.       Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property    and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few    close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul, so i    have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to    be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed    money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia.    Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself    anymore.      I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and    distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria    and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I    do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I    have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the    huge cash deposit of twenty million dollars ($20,000, 000.00) that I    have with a Finance and Security Company abroad. I will want you to help    me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I    have set aside 50% for your time and service.      Please reply me with honesty as soon as you receive this mail.       God be with you.   Bhai Patek.      NB: For confidential reasons you can contact me through my personal    email address.

I got a job in my field at a pharmaceutical company and it only paid me $12/hr. it took 6 months for my rate to go to $14/hr. i hated my job and the whole field related to it so i quit. i felt like it was pointless going to cellege and getting myself in debt with student loans for shitty payin jobs.  i had friends who didnt have college degrees and they were makin $16/hr workin in a bank. anyways.. in about 10 months i will be moving out of this country but mean while i need to get a job that would pay some decent money so i could save up a little... WHAT SHOULD I DOOO!! im sick of job agents sending me to $13 and $14/hr jobs. I need guidance.. and it doesnt have to be related to science. help plz :(

20060926143504AA2ASq9	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Does it matter what degree you have after some experience?	I am a junior in college. I recently declared my major as marketing. All of the bachelors degrees offered in our business school are for "Bachelors of Science in Business Administration and _______".    I have heard that after your first entry-level job, the actual major you had is irrelevant. That is the important part of the degree is the business administration, not necessarily the marketing. Is that correct?    The reason I ask is because I am somewhat leery of my major. I have heard from a few people that marketing is a hard field to make it in. It seems a lot of people are suggesting finance as my major. I am considering minoring in finance.
