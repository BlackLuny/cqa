I love BMW's and have wanted one for a number of years.  Just last week I happend to have totaled my car.  While researching for something else I found a diamond in the rough i think.  A 2006 BMW 325i with 52,000 miles for $16999 but I have talked her down to $16,000 The color is silver blue matallic if it matters.  It seems like a great deal and the CARFAX is clean on it, with only one owner.  Now I'm pretty sure the warranty is no longer valid since its over 50K miles.  I have thought about purchasing another one from my dealership.  Any comments on this would be helpful.  Please let me know!

20090223163956AAfc4ZA	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What would be an accurate private party estimate for this car?	So I'm looking into purchasing a car from my sister's fiancee. I would like to know about what I should be paying for this car. It will be my first car, so it's not like it's a super nice car, but it works and that's all I'm concerned with      The car is as follows: 1998 Plymouth Neon Expresso. 2 Door. 4 cyl, 2.0 Liter Engine. Automatic Transmission. about 115,000 miles (way off in other guesstimates). Power steering, locks, windows. AC. Single CD player, with iPod Hookup. Cloth interior. Pretty well up to date on oil changes. Mechanically sound. Exterior has a few dings, no rust that I know of.       Basically I'm looking for about how much I could expect to be paying for this vehicle. Like I said it's going to be my first car. I plan on driving it as long as it works. He's a big car guy. His grandfather has a shop so he really knows what he's doing. Most of the miles are highway miles.       So if someone could give me a general estimate as to what I could expect to pay for this car, that would be great.

Are they trying to act like a tough bad biker to try to impress their customers?

Here's what I can tell you:      >No Recent accidents/dings/dents etc   >Snowing about 2 inches on the ground   >Got stuck on a bit of ice (normal for me)   >Wheel is loose (aka normal) when driving straight or soft curves   >Must force the wheel to turn left or right, very tight, like its stuck.  >Much harder than it normally is to turn. (Vehicle does turn, but it needs more oomph at the wheel   >Checked my power steering fluid, its full      What is it? I thought at first its maybe because of the snow, but now I think its something else.  Again, it drives normal when Im going straight or around soft curves.  It kinda makes a sound when the car is idling and i turn the wheel.      Thanks for the help!! If you need anymore info, ask it and i'll put it in the additional details.      Also, if you suggest something needs repairing, could you give a guess-timate on how much it would be to fix? thanks!

20090222121244AAHDwpF	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;BMW	BMW 5 Series - Idrive bluetooth random freeze?	I've had my 5 series for months and have not had a problem using the bluetooth idrive system with the two phones I have.     Today, my personal mobile decided not to work, so I attempted to delete the pairing and recreate it from scratch.  This seemed to work as normal, but now when I go into an entry in my phonebook through I drive, the call option is greyed out.   Even worse, when I turn off the ignition, remove the key and lock the car, the idrive screen reverts back to the blue-background screen you get in the phone/bluetooth menu and says "transferring data" permanently - like when you initially connect your phone.   I can still get in the car and when I turn the ignition on, navigate around the rest of the idrive system, so I'm unsure what is wrong.      Ideas anyone?  Help please!? :o(
20090222105449AAHR8jU	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Pontiac	What is this on the engine of my Firebird?	I have a 1984 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with the 5.0L H.O engine. It was purchased in 1984 by my dad when it was brand new. It only has about 37,500 Miles on it. When it was purchased at the dealership, the factory applied some sort of sealant in/on the engine compartment that was supposed to prevent it from rusting because of the salt that was applied to the streets in the winter. It was great at the time, even though the car was never driven in the winter.      Does anyone know what this is, and if they do, how to remove it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

20090222114502AAKlOsY	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What kind of gas mileage do Dodge Neons get?	My sister's fiancee has a 1998 Dodge Neon. He has been eyeing his mom's car for a long time. And according to him, his mother bought a new car yesterday and is going to be willing to sell him her car. He has his Neon still, and said that if I wanted the car then I have first dibs on it.       Now my sister, owes my mom 500 dollars. Right now the offer is that my mom forgets about the owed money if we can have the car. I need the car for driving to and from work and out with my friends on the weekends. It's a nice little car. He has taken care of it, and most of the miles on it are highway miles. I think it has around 150,000 miles but I'm not 100% sure.      I know this isn't going to last me a long time. But once I get my license, I'm going to need a car to drive to gain experience. It's a car that is not going to be a huge deal if it gets a few dings and dents.       So what kind of gas mileage do Neons get, and do you think it will be a good car for me to drive until I have enough money to upgrade to something a little nicer. I'm planning on driving it until it dies OR until my boss finds and fixes up a car for me (my original plan for my first car). So I'm looking at driving it at least through the summer. Do you think it would be ok to go forward with getting this car?

If driving cross country for a total of about 6,000 miles, almost all highway miles, would you be able to just change the oil in your vehicle before leaving and not worry about changing it again until you get back home?  If you did go the whole 6,000 miles without an oil change, what would be the worst that could happen?  I've heard all kinds of different answers to this question, and wanted to know what you guys think.  I just think it would be an inconvenience to have to stop somewhere during your vacation to have an oil change, so would it really be necessary in the situation I stated?

I am under 18 so I couldn't lose my license or get any points on it.  He never told me I would be getting the fines or had me sign anything.

20090222152533AA3HQsI	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My 96 Subaru Legacy will not start?	A couple of times, my car has decided not to start.  All of the lights (check engine, battery, etc) come on, as well as my outside lights.  It has responded once to being jumped, but I don't know if it may be purely coincidental.  Another day, it simply started a few hours later.  Last night, it would not start, and when I returned today, it still would not.  It usually clicks once but that is that, and it did not respond to jumping.  I'm a commuter student, so my life is pretty contingent upon my car working... and I'm terribly terribly broke so I don't have much money to put into it.  I'm not sure what this could be due to.  And I don't understand a damn thing about cars, so other answers I have found left me confused.  Does anyone know what this may be?      I also have this really awesome problem where one of my spark plugs just likes to pop completely out sometimes.  Does anyone know if this may be related?

Im looking for an easy way to commute from Oshawa or Hamilton to Pearson International Airport, and since it seems like the Taxi Unions have kept any good public transit away from the airport, it looks like I am going to have to drive.      I know rush hour traffic on the QEW and 401 is terrible, so it seems my only option is to take the 407. From what i can tell on their website, it looks like it will cost me at least 20 dollars a day to commute, and if you add gas money to that, it seems like its hardly worth it for a 12 dollar an hour job.      Anyways, long story short, does 407 etr offer an sort of monthly pass where you just pay a set amount per month and you get to use it however much you want? I looked on there website and I couldn't find anything.      Thanks in advance!

I could not talk with that person as i got stuck in my car. But as per police report he was complaining about pain on his right arm and right leg. I have insurance with 25k limit per peron/ 50k limit per accident. I don't know what happened to that person.      Do i need to worry much about it? Is it really too serious? What should i keep in mind? What should i do?What should not i do?
20090222114039AApojta	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Under GEICO fraud investigation? Is this a stall tactic?	On the 19 of Feb. I signed up for GEICO insurance and was told that my policy would be efective as of that day. Later on that day while driving home from work, I was in an accident. When i called GEICO to report it, they first said that they were unable to find my policy. But after beign on hold for what seemed like forever, they came back on the phone and said that my policy was not effective until the 20th, even though the cards they sent me in email were dated the 19th. When I got hoem later that night I had new insurance cards in my email dated the 20th. I called GEICO back and asked why they had changed the date and was given the answer of the customer service rep i spoke to that mornign had entered the wrong date and that my policy would not be effectiv euntil the next day. Well Friday mornign rolls around and I get a call from the claims adjuster telling me that i am under investigation for fraud, because she finds it hard to believe that I was in an auto accident the same day that I saigned up for insurance. And that it wll take up to 6 months for the investigation, and until that time they were unable to settle my claim. So, what do I do now, that was my only vehicle and i can't wait 6 months while GEICO plays around with me. Its a clean claim. I have a filed police report, eye whitnesses and the person invoved in the accident.

20090222115501AApIyuZ	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Lower car insurance by faking who is primary driver w/ parents?	I'm planning to buy a new sports car, but insurance (even on my parents family plan) is too expensive to have myself as the primary driver (24 yr old male w/ a recent accident).        My plan is to have my parents who live 80 miles away from me, be the primary driver of the new car.  While I will be the primary driver of their old lincoln town car.      How risky is my plan?  What's the probability of it working perfectly even through auto claims?      A few concerns:   1) I hear auto insurers routinely check up on the mileage every 6 months, how strict are they with making sure the primary drivers are really driving their respective cars?      2) Can my parents be claimed as primary DRIVER (on the new car for auto insurance), even if we co-signed for the auto loan and I am the primary BORROWER?            2.2) what if they are the primary borrower on the loan?  Does that make it more believable to the auto insurance?         FYI, i've already gotten quotes, and if i were the primary driver, it would be $250 a month, and my dad would be $60 a month.  So, I really hope my plan works!

I have a thing where I buy at bargain prices.  As far as I know they are all American made.  (I could be wrong)        1977 Cadillac Sedan Deville - 64,779 miles.  Paid $1,500 and it's in Mint condition - Swallows gas like the whale swallowed Jonah.      1981 Ford Escort 4 speed.  Sips gas like I sip tea.  Sloooooowly ... I love it.  I paid $800 and it only has 63,000 + miles.       1991 Buick Riviera.  A good car.  I love it (I paid $1,500 - 111,697 miles)  Gas mileage is ok.      1990 Dodge Dynasty.  I bought it for $4,000 and spent $4,000 keeping it running.  I could kick myself in the (insert word here) for buying this piece of (insert other word here).        1973 Chevy Cheyenne truck - Mileage is unknown but it swallows gas and the whale that swallowed Jonah!  I got it for $500 only cause I needed to haul things.  It was a bad investment because of the gas mileage.  Oh well.   Sigh ...      My latest car (because I got tired of paying to repair older cars) is a 2007 Ford Taurus.  All around a very good car (In my most humble opinion) and I like it so far.  Gas mileage is pretty good for me.  I paid $8,797 and it had 34,675 miles.  Ford even let me add a premium 3 year warranty after mine expires for $1,300.         Why aren't we as a nation buying more American cars?      Thanks and thumbs up to all who answer!  Just give me time to get back and read them.

20090222140310AAGerYv	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Need to get rid of my car loan!?	I pay $448 a month for my '07 jeep liberty i bought brand new. I've paid off near 5,000 and I have $20,000 left (after ,fees, and everything the stupid car was $25k).   Anyway, it is the stupidest mistake I've ever made. I am in my early 20s and I want to go back to college. I can't afford to go to school with this gigantic car payment.   According to the blue book the car is only worth like $14k.   I only have like 10k miles on it and it's in good shape.   So, basically.. I am like 6k in the hole.   Is there a way I can sell the car back to the dealer and then be stuck with a 6 thosand dollar loan?   I'd rather not have a car. I just want to get rid of it. I dream about setting it on fire.    Is there a way that I can get a smaller loan for the 6k I owe and make  it into smaller payments?   I'd rather walk.

20090222140616AALGhLI	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	I bought a motorcycle yesterday and I need some help with the process of getting it tagged and licensed.?	I just bought this motorcycle yesterday and haven't done anything with it besides bring it home. I am slightly confused about the procedures in getting it tagged and licensed. I know that I have to get it put in my name through the state, I have to get a safety inspection before I can get the tags and license plate and pay taxes on it and what not. So my problem is: how am I supposed to get a safety inspection on it if I can't legally drive it to get it inspected? I don't own a truck to transport it. So, while I'm trying to figure that problem out I'm going to take my car to the DMV and get my permit so I can start practicing on what I hope to soon be a licensed and tagged motorcycle. Any suggestions would be helpful.

I can't believe prices on these torches and regulators never come down.      I am guessing it's because not enough people buy them anymore.  It's a dying form of welding.

20090222132040AAZKlP8	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	How do i prove to the BMV that my car was inoperable?	Yesterday I received a "random selection" notice from the BMV stating that I need to provide proof of insurance for my vehicle. However, my car was being worked on by a family friend since late December, knowing i wouldn't get it back for over a month and with money being so tight I chose to not pay my insurance while it was being worked on (since I wouldn't be operating it). The BMV website says that you can be exempt from proving insurance (for the date of February 11th in my case) if you have evidence that your car was inoperable but I have no idea how to prove this! Maybe a work order from my friend? Or bring him in as a witness? I even tried to contact my insurance company to see if I could just pay for the entire month of February retroactively but they wouldn't allow me to. I'm so nervous because the first offense penalty is losing my license for 90 days! I think it's unfair because every law I've ever seen has said you will get in trouble if you operate a vehicle without insurance and I didn't operate it at all without coverage! I have insurance now but my only options are to prove that I was insured on February 11th or prove that my vehicle was inoperable. Any ideas?

What would be the cause of this?  Also a week before hitting pothole I had just had all tires balanced and rotated. Also car is a 2008 with only 6000 miles on it so I know the tires arent worn.
