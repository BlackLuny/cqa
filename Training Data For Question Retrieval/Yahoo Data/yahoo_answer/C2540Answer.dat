I don't think you have to do an actual driving test but I think you might have to do the written test again (this has give way questions and other questions about Australian roads) - which is only like $30. Then if you pass they will take a photo of you and make your new Australian license, so it's not that expensive.|`|8Xu0A70Saa	Not that I know.

AA10331789	The "tail pipe" on a car or motorcycle simply extends the exhaust pipe and will not change the engine performance since it is the same diameter as the exhaust pipe and usually very short in length. See what options you find on http://www.JCWhitney.com  Car performance enthusiasts sometimes install a bigger diameter exhaust system on their cars to increase the horsepower, but I don't think you'd notice any difference on a motorcycle because the exhaust pipe is so short.|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	bobweb is correct if you are not working with a high output engine the pipe won't matter on race cars you have to have the maximum flow of the exhaust so you don't build back pressure that would cause the car to Performance to be degraded.

808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	the clutches and bands will be replaced and when they do it it will have to be completely over hauled that means all o rings, clutches bands and if you let it go to long hard parts might be damaged and the would have to be replaced to. Also there may be updates to fix problems with the transmission  that may have caused the problem in the first place, they will have to change the filter and fluid they average 18 US quarts and if it is an older car they may have to replace the modulator valve as well. A transmission overhaul will cost between $1200.00 if there is no damage to internal parts and as high as $2000.00 that is including Labor and when they fix it they have to replace the front and rear main seals and possibly the front pump and the shift rod sealand they may have to install a repair sleeve where the drive line goes into the tail shaft of the transmission they will also replace the filler tube seal as well. I give you all this information so that you know this is standard when build a transmission they won't risk failure of the rebuild by not doing all of the above repairs. IF they just replaced the bands and clutches and it went out two months later You would be upset and the mechanic is not going to want to do it for free so he will do all the necessary repairs the first time so he does not have to do it for free.|`|q8vILEpfaa	If you have automatic trans it will be more than likely the shift bans.

Havn't heard the one about rust though. . .    Re JG, Yeah the oil thing was when they came out at first, some used oil, some didnt! It was just down to luck whether you got a good 1 or not. And the ones that used oil didnt use it gradualy, it'd be fine for weeks then one day be at minimum. Mazda couldnt explain it and it was never an official recall.

If there is a problem it would have been reported to the US Department of Transportation, that oversees vehicle recalls and complaints. I have not read of any such studies being conducted.  For the most part rust in any car is related to car care. If any owner that lives in a salt prone area (this includes coastal regions), does not take care of mud build up on the undercarriage, and body drains, they will rust.  Be warned that the Rotary engine in the RX8 has several unique operating requirements. Like making sure it comes off of high idle before turning the engine off. Also the hot start directions must be followed. There is a special sequence to use for a flooded engine also.  Be sure to read the owners manual is what I am saying!|`|dFKwt7c6aa	I doubt any car would rust that fast, there only a few years old.

Even those that have "unlimited" Carfax & Autocheck accounts can ONLY use those accounts "personally".  It would be against their Terms of Service to run the VIN for you.

You may not modify, publish, TRANSMIT, display, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit any of the Content, in whole or in part.

Carfax & AutoCheck companies are NOT non-profit organizations. They charge for their research results & rightly so....They do not allow paying users to run results for non-paying users.

You can also do a free check of the vin (only for theft or total loss) from the National Insurance Crime Bureau site:  https://www.nicb.org/cps/rde/xchg/nicb/h...

DO NOT rely on Carfax, either. Even if you do get a full report, it still pays to come up with the $100 or so and have a licensed mechanic check out the car. Carfax is not gospel on any car's history. There are always ways that information can not make its way to a Carfax report, and you do not want to take that chance.|`|iDAH9OQtaa	Ask the seller for a free report. You can also find used cars with free reports at http://www.carfax.com/used_car_classifie... In addition to viewing a vehicle history report, we also recommend taking a thorough test drive and having the Jeep inspected by your mechanic.
XgpuXjwtaa	Sorry, but because of all the overinflated and fraudulent claims, the insurance companies do have to complete a thorough investigation.  I do wonder however, why they feel your claim has an element of fraud.  Perhaps your equipment was not properly insured for the intended use. Or perhaps you just endorsed it, and it was stolen.  Maybe no signs of B&E.   It is hard to say.      You should simply call the adjuster and find out the status of the claim.  At minimum, the insurance company needs to let you know the status.  They cannot continue to tell you they are investigating.  If you are not happy with the response, ask to speak to a supervisor.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	A month is not a long time when it comes to an investigation.  And, this is all normal.  It takes time for the claim rep to pull everything they need to sign off an o.k. to pay the claim on it.  It is ok to call the claim rep and ask for an update.      After everything checks out they will pay you.   There is so much fraud that unfortunately good guys have to be checked out too.

Even old releases would help if you practised. How much do you think the questions change.... basically they don't.   All that happens with new releases is that a couple of new questions will be added, and some will have a different way of asking the same question.   Basically there is a bank of just over 1000 questions, and if you obtain a result of 85% and your hazard perception is good (you'll need that for everyday driving) then you pass the test. Keep practising the training test until you NEVER achieve a score of less than 43 and all will be well on the day.  Try charity shops...... they sell them a whole lot cheaper.

I just answered a question where they refused to put antifreeze in the radiator.  What about an oil leak, what would you do.  A lot of folks ignore things like that and they pull the oil stick one day and there's no oil.  An engine is something you have to watch constantly.|`|qxSlQoRAaa	WHy don't you sober up before asking a question and then you might make sense.
XsZsk55Jaa	I think about the distance and the time it will take to get there at the times I will be traveling.  I always made a couple of practice runs.  What good is 10 miles if it's going to take an hour each way.  Would you be better off working for a bit less but putting in overtime (if they let you) or relaxing at home instead of sitting in traffic?  Then again, sometimes there is no choice.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	are they going to pay you enough to drive that far?if not find a better or closer job.|`|8Xu0A70Saa	Not really as long as I possess own transport.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	I do, You have to figure in what their paying you and what it cost you to drive that far.  Its not just gas, you have to figure in the wear and tear on your vehicle and the fact that your going to have to replace it more often if your driving a lot of miles.  You also have to figure in the time your speding on the road.
RbsRpcIyaa	If you signed paperwork and drove off, the car is yours. Make sure you always have any used vehicle checked out thoroughly by a licensed mechanic.     Lemon law? Uh, no. There are only a few states that even consider lemon law cases on used vehicles, and the one stipulation that must exist is that the vehicle is still under the manufacturer's warranty. Doesn't sound like that's the case here.     And if someone comes on here and says, "Oh, you have 3 days, 72 hrs, 30 days, etc" they are not correct. This does not apply in vehicle sales.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	They could sell it to you if they wanted to but usely they sell them at the auctions|`|x97x8dVXaa	Yes, anyone can sell a junk car.  Some state have lemon laws, you might want to look into that.  in most juris dictions though, unless there was fraud, misrepresentation or title issues you're not likely to have many if any rights.    Even if there is fraud or misrepresentation - you will have the burden to prove it in court.  Often what you can prove in legal terms does not accurately reflect what happened, but the courts are not really set up to try and figure out who's telling the truth or what is the nice thing to do.  It may seem frustrating, but consider had you sold a car that someone was unhappy about - you wouldn't want a court to make you take it back based on claims the buyer made there were not true or undocumented.    Most good attorneys will look at your case and give you honest feedback as to your options.  Beware those that want to take a case on contingency.

hkLY035raa	You've two-thirds solved it already, wiggling wires made it come on once before.  Now the connection has degraded so badly that no amount of wiggling will get the business ends back together.  You're going to need to get under the dash - post-partum, I'd imagine - and find where the power goes into the switch or the fan and find/fix the break.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	bad connection or a bad switch.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	Sounds like either the wires might be off the blower motor under the glove glovebox or the blower motor is going bad.|`|SLy9xFwkaa	CHeck your Fuse box :) look in there for any blown fuses if not that then you've got a real problem and its gonna cost your some $$$|`|DNQxUcptaa	It doesn't sound good that you moved some wires and it came back on, however you need to be a bit more descriptive about the exact problem. Is it just the fan that doesn't turn on? Does the engine fan turn on if the engine is idling for a long time?  My first thought is the thermostat has gone, but you have confused me by mentioning the wiring.|`|AA11537248	You probably either pulled a wire off of its contact or arc-ed one to ground someplace under the dash.    If the heater kicked on while wiggling wires, then that's the problem.  You need to wiggle each wire and find the open (or short) circuit.    Start with the control panel before you start crawling around under the dash.  Maybe one of the wires came off of the switches.    Good luck, and Go Bears!|`|CuJbuDZqaa	sound like it could either be a blower motor resistor or the wires going into it my guess would be the resistor it usually is the resistor on rare occasions its the blower motor itself hard to say without having car here to look at

Yq2CUhtYaa	Airfilter will give you about 1 extra lb of torque.    That's about it.    Even if you do an entire intake, exhaust, headers, etc....you might get an additional 5-6 wheel torque.    You won't notice the difference. It will create a placebo effect. You know it has new parts. It sounds different. You drive it harder, to see the new performance; so it feels faster. But all it is, is you driving it harder than before. 5 lbs of torque for a 3000lb vehicle? You won't notice it.    You didn't give any info at all about what vehicle you have, so it's hard to say. But ignore the advertised claims of what parts can do. They take the highest number that they saw, and ignore the rest of the dyno charts.|`|DV4xyeChaa	air intake is part of engine system...alone it will do almost nothing...more air in,,,bigger carb/injectors...performance chip...exhaust system upgrade...will up horse power...torque is harder to get...more a function of HP versus weight.|`|d7oxOMT6aa	Read the small print on the adverts for go-faster air filters, They all say that the claimed power gain is compared to an "end of life" standard filter.    A new standard filter will usually give the same improvement. That's why the air filter is replaced at regular intervals.    Some cars do have restrictive air filters as standard, but on these cars any gain in performance is only at the top of the rev range, as this in when the air demands are highest.    improving torque at lower RPM is difficult, usually the best way is with forced induction. Not an easy or cheap option.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	easiest way too give your car more power is too have a chip fitted bassically an ecu remap   yhis web site will tell you the powergain you could expect                                                                                                                                                                                                http://www.supertuning.co.uk/bmw-318i-13...|`|AA11562422	push it down a mountain it will pull anything|`|dbFJW67baa	air filter will do nothing for torque gain power maybe 1hp, and you will not feel any difference other than noise  To do it properly you need to revise the cams and a better flowing exhaust also better gas flowed head will work well. You also need to re program the fuelling and ignition timing. Any modification wants setting up on a rolling road to get the most out of any modification, other wise it will be pointless  The cheapest option is to get a 323/5i engine stuck in it, don't forget you need to stop the thing so brake upgrades will be necessary!|`|AA10643913	If you modify your car in ANY way at all your insurance will be void and you'll be driving illegally if you do not inform said Ins Co. They will inevitably 'up' your premium. If you have a accident whilst driving in this way you'll have to pay all costs which could run into thousands of 's. And you'll have your licence taken away.|`|AA10331789	Change to a smaller diameter drivewheel tire rim and you'll get more torque when starting up from a stop. But this will throw off all your computer controls for a modern car.    http://www.eastwoodco.com/jump.jsp?itemI...|`|AA12334360	A decent airfilter will reduce air resistance during induction and have no effect on torque, the most a decent air filter will give you is a couple of HP at the top end.    To get more torque you have to get more fuel and oxygen into the engine at low speeds. As a minimum this would mean remapping the ECU and fitting higher pressure injection. At the extreme you would also add a supercharger, new cams, new manifolds etc    To be honest, you'd be better getting an "m" engine

AA11537248	Anything's feasible in the automotive world if you have enough money.    T-tops leak.  I hope you carry an extra pair of pants to change into after you sit in a wet seat.    Before you go taking a sawz-all to your Firebird, you need to make sure that there is no structural cross-bracing on the roof that might be in the way.    A homemade t-top will not add value to a car.  Most bolt-on mod's take value away, because they tell a potential buyer that either a kid, or somebody that drove the car hard (as in, beat the hell out of the car) owned it.|`|8zVxYkluaa	It's not worth it at all.  It's a ton of work and not worth the effort.  With the 3rdgen Fbodies being so cheap it's not worth the money to swap stuff.  You're better off buying a ttop car in running condition.  It can be done, it's been done but again, it's not worth the money.  It's not a matter of switching a roof.  There's cutting involved and if you're off just a little you're going to have huge leaking issues.      If you were doing it yourself and had the means to do so I'd say give it a shot, but if you're going to pay for a shop to do it then the cost will exceed the value of your car most likely(being serious).      If the ttop car is in great condition and is mint then maybe considering swapping the motor over to the ttop car?    BTW, it would not add ANY value to the car, in fact it'd probably decrease the value because it's not a factory job and could easily be viewed as a hack job.  I personally wouldn't buy a ttop car that was converted from a hard top by a shop...I'd be asking for trouble.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	T-tops are easy to break into & are often stolen.|`|e54fb96489b944942a923d6d77426c42aa	1st. Did the "Tops" come out of a 92?  If not, there may be to many modifications.  2nd, Do you still have the donor car?  If the car is the same, (type and year)  what I would do is change the entire roof.  Example: Remove the windshield and  saw through the w/s posts. Take the  back hatch off and cut the rear posts.  Then do the same to the other car and   weld the donor top on your car and there  you have it as the factory would do it.  I have a body shop and that's the way I   have done it for years.    Good luck!|`|88ca921e0c252f3cf12e19d369f73438aa	Look up the resale value on both. There isn`t much difference.

I would compare the base models as they would have more similar features.    If you don't select similar models it is like comparing apples to oranges.  I.E. it is not a fair comparison to compare a supercharged Mustang to a normally aspirated Camaro.  This is why it would be better to compare the base model.    I always prefered the Camaro.|`|0TVenxJyaa	If you need to side with the Mustang, just be sure not to include the Mustang II, that POS was and still is a blight on the history of the car|`|0qT7iZ3Oaa	Well, I have a Mustang... and I would choose the Camaro side!  Mustangs use inferior parts... the transmissions are notorious for being improperly assembled, there is no independent rear suspension, and the V-8 is horribly undersized when compaired to a Hemi.  The only thing a Mustang has going for it (and I do mean the only thing) is that it is considerably cheaper than the other modern muscle cars.  You get what you pay for.    Camaro is backed by a higher end car muscle car company in Chevrolet, does not flood the market with 1000 variations of the same car, and spend the time and care needed to properly build and service their vehicles.  Camaro has taken a few years off by not being produced, and has come back with some significant horsepower and revamped looks.    The one problem I have with both cars is the incredibly basic interiors... don't be expecting luxury feel/looks on the inside of any Ford or Chevy (or Dodge for that matter).    Just so you know- I have a 2008 Mustang Bullitt which is considered the top of the Mustang food chain (before getting into Shelby's)... take my word for it- stay clear of Mustangs.|`|AA11537248	Use the 1968 models for your comparison.|`|uS2fvLQBaa	Well, the Mustang is a lot better than the Camaro. The Mustangs have been in the market for over 50 years, and the Camaro had stopped production in 2002. (because the Mustang was AMERICAS favorite car.)    Overall, the Mustang is a great car, and you should definitely try and get one.    The Camaro, is coming back in like a month or so, but because of GM's financial woes, and pathetic quality problems...dont get the Camaro.    I'll give them about 5 years in the market. Then they'll die again!|`|0CkFC43raa	a really good comparison would be the 1971 boss 351 mustang vs the 1971 camaro Z28.|`|721d17af7ed8e6e667fae5b7b141bcb3aa	For the mustang side, I would definitely go with the 03-04 SVT Cobra.

AA12339318	Most auto racing tends to be done on dry pavement.  For such conditions, the more rubber in contact with the road surface, the greater the traction.  The greater the traction, the faster a race car can go around a corner.  So, no treads and wide tires means more rubber on the road.      However, when it rains during a race, the crews will put special rain tires, which are wide, but will also have some tread cut in.  The tread pattern helps channel the water on the road out to the side, helping the tire avoid aquaplanning, which is the tendancy for the tire to "float" above the wet surface.  When the tires do this, they lose their grip on the road and the race car skids.  The treads help minimize this tendancy.    On the street, road conditions are monitored a LOT less carefully than they are on a race track.  So, street tires are designed to handle the greatest variety of road conditions possible.  Safety engineers KNOW that a car owner is not about to change to another set of tires just becuse it is dry one moment and wet another.  And, since street legal driving does NOT involve going around the corner as fast as possible, regular, treaded tires are more than adequate to hold a car on the road as long as it is driven properly.|`|wpgRMjgraa	For getting better traction.........|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	mostly to repel water if you look real close only race cars that wil have treads wil be racing in rain or road racing|`|b5ySK6SGaa	Wider tyre help grip to the road surface better. Combined with smooth there is a greater contact patch allowing substantial grip to be created.    Regular tires have tread for wet weather handling. As water builds up under smooth tyres causing them to slip. Tread disperses the water from the contact patch. As regular road car tyres are narrower this saves fuel as there is less contact with road and less weight. With driving on road the large amount of grip isn't needed, as the cars with narrower tyres usually have low power.

5Ejzxc6naa	NO! DexCool was specifically designed for your modern engine. It has a different protection package for your engine and cooling system. The green antifreeze is the old ethylene glycol based coolant designed for older engines. Do not mix the 2 coolants as they are very different. The Dex Cool is an Organic Acid Technology based coolant, while the old green coolant is not. The problem is not with the coolant, rather it is with the poor design of the gaskets and materials that they are made with. GM and other aftermarket companies have come out with redesigned gaskets that work fine with the Dex Cool. Other instances that are wrongly blamed on Dex Cool is poor maintenance and air infiltration into the cooling system. Service your Dex Cool every 3 years or 40,000 to 50,000 miles instead of the old recommendation of 5 years/150,000 miles, and check your radiator cap to make sure the seal has not failed, letting air in the cooling system.|`|ozSMRTEMaa	no|`|56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	Yes.  The DEX-COOL is nothing but a problem and I recently flushed my Grand Prix GTP and used the green.  Make sure that the reservoir tank gets changed and the line from the reservoir gets flushed, that's another place the DEX-COOL plugs up.
Yq2CUhtYaa	Temperature has nothing to do with it.    But it is bad to let the fuel get that low.    Fuel pumps, which sit inside your gas tank, are cooled and lubricated by the fuel itself.    If the fuel gets too low, it will take away the cooling effect from the pump. This can cause them to overheat.     Do this repeatedly, and you drastically shorten the life of the fuel pump.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	"Old mechanics Tales" are based on old tech, it is safe but why bother in cold weather? Keep it filled.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	I'll back you up 100%, I never let the gas tank get below 1/2 tank as the gas keeps the fuel pump in the gas tank cool as the gas is the only thing that keeps it cool, also when running that low your sucking up all the dirt and water if any off the bottom of the tank, tell your husband he is dead wrong.|`|etA9BX5gaa	keeping your tank full in winter is good because  1. it adds weight to your car for driving on slippery roads.  2. having a full tank gives less of a chance for water getting in, which wouldn't allow your car to start.    i don't think its doing damage...but it could cause a major inconvenience.|`|oztoPKrGaa	He probably didnt want to get out because its cold.  I sometimes let my light come on but i fill it up as soon as i go out next time if im already close to home or ill fill it up right away if im not.  Yes , he should fill it up.  Dont be lazy.  Exspecially if you use the car to.  If its that cold out.  The man should deff do it;)|`|DV4xyeChaa	hes a dope...water/ice and dirt can mess up filter and injectors....fuel pump is colled by the gas...and u dont want to run out...once air is in system its sometime hard to get started again without mechanic. [my friend at Bobs Garage is always on the road helping dopes|`|8AUHuHsIaa	ask him when it runs low  does he want to put in fuel filter cause he sucked up all the rust and trash in tank this build up is not good for the gas milage he thinks like its ok but when trouble hits it hits hard and make him fix it cold weather is real bad cause if you dont have garage got to do it outside in the wind and cold about 3 hrs time and he not allowed to tow it to shop to fix his screwup or have anybody help        or it could be that he thinks he knows what he is doing      well tell em he wrong all the time even if he is right sometimes|`|mTwn8p79aa	It doesn't hurt anything, in fact you'll get better mileage as the tank is lower as you're hauling around about 60 fewer pounds of fuel.  Unless you've got rear wheel drive, you don't want all that extra weight in the back of the car to help spin you around on slippery winter roads.    Unless the car is going to sit for a few days you don't have to worry about condensation in the tank, that's the water someone else pointed out.  Furthermore, at any temp below 32, you can't have condensation so there's absolutely nothing to worry about and at temps above freezing you're not doing anything to block condensation unless the tank is full to the brim.  This misconception comes from small aircraft, where just an ounce of water sucked through the engine at takeoff could be disastrous.  Small aircraft are always stored with the tanks topped off for just this reason.    To think you're picking up all the junk at the bottom of the tank when the fuel is low is just silly.  The fuel pump is in the bottom of the tank or in the fuel line under the car.  The gas is constantly sloshing around the tank, agitating the sediment at the bottom.  To think that the sediment stays at the bottom of the tank and doesn't flow into the fuel filter as it gets moved around when you've got 1/3 of a tank of gas makes absolutely no sense at all.  If that actually were the case, you'd stall out every time your fuel got low because the sludge would clog the fuel filter and fuel injectors and you'd need to replace them every few thousand miles.    Gas won't freeze until you get to about -150.  Unless you're parking in a test lab deep freeze, you don't have to worry about temps like that.    The fuel pump is cooled by gas, but, unless it actually stalls out, it's still got gas running past it.  No harm done there either.  There's also no real harm in running out of gas besides the huge inconvenience and knowing that you're an idiot for not stopping at that last station.  Get some fuel in it and it will fire right up.  This is absolutely not the case with a diesel engine.  They are very tough to get started and keep running if they run out of gas and it should be avoided at all costs.  This is probably where your misconception was seeded.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Hard on the fuel pump.|`|2cc75788c0a85d7434cad7a54afd37ecaa	The issue isn't fill/no fill. This is a control issue. He thinks he's right, you think you're right. There is enough evidence to support both.    The trick is to get him to change his behaviour. Sex is a powerful weapon. Guilt another.    Until he runs out with the kiddies inside, the guilt thing won't work.    Withholding marital delights is mean and can lead to other troubles.    But here is an idea: For Valentine's Day buy him a one gallon fuel can and a Roadside Emergency Kit. Murry's have both. Put them in his trunk and let him know they are there with a VD card. If you can't change his behaviour at least you can protect him from stupidity.    I ran out of gas, two weeks ago when it was about -15. A nice lady saw me walking with my gas can, gave me lift to the Mobile and a ride back. If it wasn't for that Gas Can, I'd still be walking.|`|xjXwsBRwaa	When the gas tank gets that low, the sediments in the bottom can wind up in the fuel line and fuel injectors...also if there is any condensation in the fuel system its easier for it to freeze...but look at it this way, the only way you'll win this argument is when your hubby is walking down the road freezing his butt off...and they you can go "see i was right once again" LOL|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s hard on the fuel pump and gas filter. letting the gas get way down can make the pump overheat because gas is what keeps the pump cool and besides that dirt can get into the filter and clog it up.|`|dVQdswtTaa	It is possible to get condensation in the tank, but with modern fuel systems it is unlikely since they don't vent directly to the atmosphere. Older systems literally had a small hole in the cap to let air in.       Lifting water and dirt off the bottom of the tank isn't an issue either, since the fuel pump picks up fuel from the bottom of the tank all the time. If there are contaminants in the tank, they will get picked up from a full tank just as easily as with an empty one.       So, yes you're right, there is a risk, but it is a very small mechanical risk. The risk of walking in the cold and having your wife ready to kill him is much greater.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	When you constantly run your gas low like that you pick up any garbage it is on the bottom of the tank. But also being that cold the gas will freeze.

And I have seen aircraft that had to attain a takoff speed of over 120 MPH to lift off.   Back in the 70's the owner of Maule Aircraft started one of his planes in the hanger and lifted off before he cleared the hanger doors at about 40 MPH. (see link)    http://www.mauleairinc.com/img/Clears_th...|`|AA10720479	Had a twin Aero Commander 520 that took off at 80mph, have a starduster too that takes off at 40-50mph.|`|jNEI1Hfqaa	There are hundreds of "civil airplanes".  So what aircraft are you referring to?  Cessna 172, 180, 182, 185, 310, Piper cub?  and the list goes on.  Do you mean ground speed or air speed?  What air density?  You see, lower air density takes more runway to get your airspeed up to create enough lift to make the aircraft overcome the forces of drag and gravity.  So please be more specific.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Takeoff speed is reached when there is sufficient air moving over the wings to achieve lift.  So, depending on the design of the wings, the speed can vary, the speed of the wind is also a factor.    So, if the wind is blowing fast enough the forward speed of the plane could actually be zero.

HXW4i5Ajaa	This all depends upon what you need the price for. My favourite place for getting an idea of prices/values is eBay.    Yup, you read that right - eBay. Search for whatever car you are interested in, and then check the "completed items" button - you will then see what cars have actually sold for, rather than looking at ads in Autotrader.    If there are a few cars of your type sold, you can narrow it down by things like estate/hatch/saloon, petrol/diesel. manual/auto and age/mileage.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	There is more than 1 value for a car. there is retail value, trade value and wholesale or auction value. Depending on what value you are trying to get would depend on where to look. if you go to 3-4 dealers and ask them what they would write you a check for, that would be the wholesale or auction value then average those numbers. For retail value just look in the papers to see what they are selling for at local dealers in your area. Average trade is about $800-$1,500 more than auction value. ultimately a vehicle is worth whatever someone is willing to write you a check for it.|`|mTwn8p79aa	If you're buying or selling a used car, KBB.com.  Private party value is about right for what you should get when you sell or what you should buy a good car for--even at the dealer.    Banks and insurance companies use NADA.  They'll go by retail value which is higher than KBB's private party but lower than KBB's retail value.    Dealers will use KBB retail value to show you the value of their car and Black Book to show you the value of your trade.  Those, of course, are the highest and lowest values respectively.  If you're trading a car, KBB's trade value is pretty decent--you'll have to fight to get it though.  I highly suggest selling the car on your own if you're considering trading it in.  It will be incredibly easy (and can be done very quickly) to get an extra $500 - $1,000 over what the dealer offered you and you'll be giving someone a great deal on your car instead of letting the dealer make a huge profit off of it.

If your handy,  Locate the power side of the fuel pump either put a rocker switch in, or a similar device you should have a rating of 20 amps or more,  Or the pref would be to locate the grounding side of the fuel pump,  haven't been asked this to much.  If your really looking to disable!  Locate the S cable on your starter ( smallest one going to the solenoid And install switch of around 20 amps.

Go to your nearest parts store and look for a red keyed kill switch.  This device connects directly to your battery cable and is mountable under the hood or in the ridding compartment of your vehicle.  Other than the instructions that are included, if your unsure about the installation, have a gearhead buddy do it for you.  The only draw back is that it kills power to the entire vehicle, disabling electric windows etc.  When you start your engine after using this switch, the on board Computer will take a few seconds to "reboot", but it's a small price for the vehicles security.  Good Luck!  Mike|`|hHcllRVVaa	I think those Shortstars (the V6 version of the Northstar, Adezy) are installed with the battery under the rear seat. That could make putting a kill switch there a lot easier... Just a suggestion.

HXD9sT7Gaa	how long you can ride it really depends on what is wrong with the transmission. what kind of bike do you have. usually what happens on a bike jumping out of gear is the shift fork gets either bent, has excessive wear on it, or you have worn dogs on the gears. fork  damage prevents it from holding the needed amount of pressure on the slider gear. worn dogs on the gears prevents the gears from mainting engagement. another problem can be in the shifter drum. this drum has grooves cut into it that the shifter forks ride in. has you shift up or down it rotates the drum therefore repositioning the forks for which ever gear is next in your shift sequence. get you a manual on your biike and you will get a better understanding of how this works. now how long it will last. if your shifter fork is on the verge of breaking because of excessive wear and it does break at 70 mph it will lock up your transmission causing your rear wheel to lock up and i am sure you know what that means especially if you are in a curve. if you have a worn drum it usually is not going to break. it just wears down from movement of the forks in the grooves. the parts to repair this is cheap. you really should consider finding you a good tech to take a look at it for you. i hope all this helps.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	Ok, you've asked this question for something like a half dozen times.  Either you're waiting for the answer you want or you're like a broken record.    As one of the other posters answered, it sounds like a bent shifting fork or worn engagement dogs.  The transmission will run forever like that and so will the engine as long as you don't have the throttle pinned back when it pops out of gear and you float a valve.      To answer your question, just keep doing as you're doing now and it'll run until you sell the bike, crash it or put it out to pasture.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	Sell it and buy one that works right.  1200 bucks?

c6b895fa8ab23ac2b2739c41d2cb4643aa	Most employers require you to use personal or vacation days for this (not sick days). If they're in business, they need the workers to show up - what if everybody said they couldn't come in, then what would they do? That's why they have to discourage you from missing days because of weather.     As far as you losing control twice on one short trip, you either have terrible tires and/or you're driving way too fast for conditions. I've driven 100's of miles in the snow this winter alone, don't have an SUV and have not had problems like you had on your one trip in many years.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, yes you can be held liable for skipping work.  Employers have a set of standards.  If you do not give them a legitimate reason as to why you are absent then yes they can hold it against you.  However, weather is a legitimate excuse.  You should never endanger yourself when it comes to icy conditions on the road.  The best thing to do is explain to your manager that the roads are too dangerous to travel.  The employer has the responsibility of making sure someone can cover your shift. Now since you were in an accident because of weather conditions then yes that is a good excuse not to come in. But if you do not give an excuse as to why you can't come in then yes then can hold it against you.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Yes they could hold this against you but if I were you I would consider my safety first...|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	if there is a lot out not really but sure they can but most dont or cant get there them selves is a act of god cant blame anyone but him|`|DV4xyeChaa	cigarettes are more important than work...as long as you bought them and got home your ok...sit smoke and watch TV...work will be there when tou feel like going

69eef7356154e5af99966c41002555e9aa	The answer is No! I was once a volunteer engineer on a converted fishing trawler (Torbay Lass, which originally used sail when built in 1923) When I was on it in the noughties as the Kenya Jacaranda, it's engines were two Ford Transit diesels side by side  driving a shaft each. Both shafts turned the same way, clockwise. I did a number of longish pilotage runs under power with no adverse steering affects and did not even notice a pull on the tiller. For the record it was registered as 80 tonnes.|`|6bc8356604557667c776ceb4e4a5935aaa	yes if they both rotate the same way it will just go round in circles|`|AA10255553	It's not essential but makes sense. The side thrust of each propeller counteracts the other. So the vessel would not have a tendency to turn one way all the time. It also provides the captain an option of which propeller to use to get side thrust in docking and undocking.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	Essential? No.    But to balance the boat and reduce torque on the hull counter rotating sure makes things easier.|`|repO76qoaa	It's not essential but it is the most efficient way.     In small craft, a boat with counter rotating props is easier to control. Some twin engine boats without counter rotating props are difficult to steer out of a high speed hard turn to one side.     More often than not, the counter rotation is created in the transmission or marine gear just aft of the engine.     Counter Rotation: If looking at the stern of your vessel from behind it, the propeller(s) to the right of amidships would rotate clockwise relative to your position and the propellers to the left would rotate counter clockwise.|`|csmEH6qsaa	When the props turn in the same direction, the boat tends to list and steer off course. Keeping an even keel and true course requires constant attention, especially in choppy water and high winds. Much of that problem can be solved by having two props turn in opposite directions. In other words, counter-rotation. The major advantage of counter-rotation is its ability to enhance performance by reducing steering effort in all RPM ranges.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	Essential, absolutely not.  More efficient yes, but any experienced mariner knows the capabilities and the weaknesses of the set up he (or she) is using.  Most older vessels with twin screws or other wise tend to have a preferred approach angle and side to dock on.  Most commercial boats I have driven were set up just like this, for instance one boat always was docked with the starboard side to the wharf - that was the side we approached the gear on, and the only open side of the boat anyway unless we took the clears off and moved the deck gear.  My current single screw tunnel hull works to the port side, but that's my choice as I'm left handed and steer with the right hand while gaffing/gear handling with the left.  A second or two of ahead or astern thrust with the rudder amidships is ample to walk the stern either way as needed.    Prop walking a vessel in the last few metres works better with both props rotating the same way, so that is a consideration.  In practice the difference is only noticeable if you look for it - in general if the boat handles that badly that it is a significant issue then I would look for the problem but it would have to be stuffed up pretty bad for that.    What do you do with a three engine set up?  No operator I have spoken to even considers this an issue in day to day use.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	yes. to even the torque of the rotation.|`|DV4xyeChaa	Essential? no preferable yes...a Single screw ship doesn't have a counter effect...but 2 going in same direction might tilt ship and cause difficult steering...the ship will want to turn...counter rotation screws help in docking and maneuvering..

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	At 4500 miles since last reset, the Maint Reqd light will blink at you on startup (very easy to miss seeing it). At 5000 miles since last reset, the Maint Reqd light will stay on solid.    It's just a reminder by miles that you are due for the next scheduled maintenance. It is not smart (doesn't go by time, or do any oil analysis), just a mile counter. Usually that is an oil change/tire rotation: http://smg.toyotapartsandservice.com/    Should your dealer forget to reset it, or you go to an independent mechanic or DIY, you can reset the light yourself.    The odo-button dance procedure to reset the light is listed in Page 122-123 of the US 2004 Prius Owner's Manual (Section 2-5 "Operation of Instruments and Controls: Gauges, Meters and Service Reminder Indicators", item (j) in the "Service reminder indicators and warning buzzers" section).

Lyl3mHIKaa	You don't say if the engine is running while you do this.  If the engine is not running, then you can probably get it into gear.  The gears will mesh and the shifter will move into position as if the car is normally running.  The engine will then be coupled to the wheels but it won't go anywhere.  If the engine is running, attempting to shift into any gear will give you a grinding sound from the gearbox and you probably won't be able to get it into gear.  If you keep doing this, the grinding will do very bad damage to the gearbox and you may never be able to use that gear again, and you may break the gearbox so nothing works again.  Attempting to enter a gear while the engine is running and car is stationary is asking for the gearbox to do the job of the clutch, which it is not able to do.  The whole point and use for the clutch is to allow the gears to mesh first, and then gently releasing the clutch will drive the car into motion and quickly the clutch can be fully engaged, foot off.    If you have a car with a disabled clutch and you want to move it, then stop the engine, shift into first gear and then use the starter to start the engine.  The starter will first start to drive the car forward and then when the engine fires and runs the car will move.  You may have to stay in that gear, because going out of gear into neutral will make it difficult to shift into gear again. If you are in motion doing this you can only stop the car by turning off the ignition, since you won't be able to get out of gear again.  Be careful and cautious and this should only be used in an emergency.  Some car models are interlocked and you won't be able to start the car if the clutch is not depressed, so even though the clutch is not working, pressing down on the clutch will enable you to use the starter for this procedure.|`|SNVauR3laa	If the car is moving, and you do it at the correct RPM's you do not need the clutch to change gears, and no damage will be done, but this is something that you should not try unless you aren't concerned about the vehicle. If you hear grinding, you are causing damage to the vehicle. You should never have to force it into gear.|`|NPfmdsg8aa	Nothing will happen if you shift gears of a standing vehicle, providing the engine of the vehicle is not running, however if the vehicles engine is running you'll find it almost impossible to shift the transmission into any gear, you'll get a very bad grinding noise and that is not a good plan to attempt something of that nature, repair costs for manual transmissions can run you in upwards of $2000.00 and maybe even more..|`|NZvYP7Q2aa	I don't think that's possible.|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 when you hear the crash.screech,,grinding you will not try again|`|TuGkVqwraa	If the car is parked on slope and handbrake is not applied, then when you shift gear to neutral the car starts moving, Be Careful.|`|apoNgAmKaa	It is a misconception that you cannot shift gears without pressing the clutch. You can very well do that and it causes no harm if it is done occasionally. Unfortunately, not all can shift gears without the use of clutch. It is an art to learn and many car racers are well aware of this art. The process of changing gears without pressing the clutch is known as speed shifting that is used in many racing cars for quick acceleration and gear shifts.|`|GyObOjuAaa	By "standing car" I imagine you mean one that is not moving?

Engine not running, nothing.

However, if you are financed with a company like Americredit or Wells Fargo, you can put in an application to have your rate lowered.

E-mail me if you have any further questions!|`|3MTYGEbWaa	I'm not sure you'll be able to get a better rate with only a 620 score. Credit requirements have tightened up since 2005 and 620 is not a prime score that would get you a better rate. Of course, the best thing for you to do is simply go talk to a bank or credit union. They can tell exactly what rate you'll qualify for. Nobody on this answer board can tell you that.

XgpuXjwtaa	Of course he can.  Your kid brother hit a parked vehicle.  He and the owner of the vehicle are both considered legally liable for the damages.

4TZsKgAUaa	The Range Rover is a fine vehicle.  Do your research, and you will find that these people are wrong.  All good things are rated poorly by the powers that be.  Is it a good car for a yuppie?  No, and that's why they get the poor ratings.    Yuppies go buy them, realize this isn't like their Camry, and complain about it.  Then, they don't do the services that are required.  After that, they just give it an oil change every now and again.  Then, after they have mostly ruined the vehicle, they sell it to an unsuspecting buyer who finds it has problems.    The strange thing is, even then, after that buyer sells it, someone who appreciates the brand will pick it up, fix it, and drive it forever without an issue.    Land Rover products have a different kind of reliability.  Most cars will go for 150k, needing nothing, and then turn into a basket case for 50k before ending up in a junk yard being stripped for whatever parts can still be rebuilt, and the pickings are commonly slim.    Land Rovers, on the other hand, will go for pretty much ever, needing a little tinkering and extra service here and there.  You can keep a Land Rover running with it's original parts longer than any other vehicle.  They will take the worst the world can throw at them and more, and keep on working.  They are built like things used to be built, when things were better.    They have more fluids that need to be changed, that is a big mistake people make, not changing fluids properly.  They also have a transfer case that needs to be used regularly, and kept up.  There are joints that need to be greased, as well, and just like any old muscle car, you need to rev it once and again to keep the valves clean.    Do these things, and it will be with you as long as you want it.  Why the bad rep?    Yuppies buy them.  Yuppies don't know how to do this stuff.  Yuppies read consumer reports, and commonly think their day has gone south when they have to *gasp!* change a tire on the side of the road.  Changing oil is a big project for a Yuppie.  How can you tell a yuppie from a normal person?    Yuppies use the term "My Mechanic".  Yuppies don't realize that you don't have a mechanic, a mechanic has you.  He doesn't have to like you, and he doesn't give a flying fish if you show up today or not, he has other things to do.  You are just another face with a car that you ought to be able to fix yourself.    Yuppies also read consumer reports, and can commonly be heard using the term "value".

What xenon lights needs are converters to convert the voltage from the original halogen light sockets into one usable by the xenons.  They cost about 800 to 1000 dollars each, including converter that could be plugged in before plugging in the xenon blub.

Lyl3mHIKaa	I don't know what 'sounding like a wreck' sounds like.  You don't say whether the noise can be heard only while the engine is running, or when you are driving along.  Let me give some hints and tips here:  Cheap oil doesn't have any sound at all, same as expensive oil.  Even if they gypped you and didn't fill with any oil at all, the engine wouldn't make any noise in particular, and your oil warning light would come on.  Diagnostics won't necessarily find a noise. So don't make this a big deal.  You can do a lot yourself; open the hood (bonnet) and start the engine and go and listen to find the place where the noise is coming from.  Please avoid any moving parts.    Get a friend, preferably one who knows a bit about cars, to listen with you and try to locate it.  If you have to drive to hear the noise, ask your friend to listen out the window and try to find where it is coming from.  Just a wild suggestion; maybe the exhaust pipe has been damaged by them jacking up the car and this is now broken?  Check it out.  Basically what I'm saying is; try to find out as much as you can about your problem before you go back to the mechanics place, so you can insist on them fixing it properly.  Just throwing it back to them without knowing anything leaves them in charge of whatever they want to tell you.|`|NPfmdsg8aa	Your problem doesn't sound good, you have a good claim as to where your problem originated but keep in mind the shop that serviced your vehicle could deny any wrong doing on their part, they could claim that you may have been abusing your vehicle after you left their shop, such as hot rodden, leaving stop lights and stop signs like a jack rabbit, ect.ect. but it sounds like you have a good plan and I would do the same if it were me, stand your ground and hope its nothing real serious, good luck.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	If you know how or you need to get someone to check you oil level and just give your car a once over so you have back-up before you go back.

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The check engine light, vacuum leak, running lean and engine misfiring sounds like the symptoms of possibly just one problem - the vacuum leak.   You may be able to pinpoint the leak by spraying wd40 around any suspected areas - the leak will be evident if it makes a slurping, sucking sound and the engine idle changes.  Don't use a flammable spray to do this such as either or carburetor  cleaner regardless of what any one else tells you, it's dangerous.|`|4yfKLAQvaa	They failed you on an oil change? That's retarded. As for the SES, pluck off the batteries negative terminal. That will reset the PCM and turn out the light (at least temporarily). You're running lean due to the vacuum leak. Which is likely up near the intake/throttle body. Your SES light is most likely on due to the lean condition caused by the vacuum leak. See the problem here?
23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	No, you can't use a jet engine in space.  The aeroplane would reach a maximum ceiling in the atmosphere and then loose thrust. The engine would stop (flame-out).  It would then fall back until it entered air dense enough to restart.    Jet engines work by sucking in air then heating it in their combustion chambers. This causes the air to expand rapidly and hugely. The  expanded air is then expelled rapidly from the engine's exhaust pipe and pushes the aeroplane through the air.  In the vacuum of space there would be no air for the engine to heat and expand so there would be no thrust. Even if you injected oxygen directly into the engine (from an on-board tank) it still wouldn't work. They need atmosphere.    Rocket engines work in a very different way. They simply burn a fuel/oxygen mix which expands rapidly. The expanded gas is expelled from the exhaust nozzle and by virtue of the law "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction" the spaceship moves forward.    The maximum height (ceiling) of a jet aeroplane is determined by its ability to suck in enough air to usefully expand. The greater the altitude, the lower the air pressure = less available for an engine to use.   For example, the Concorde airliner flew at twice the speed of sound at an altitude well above any other commercial aeroplane. It had to have very special engine intake nacelles to enable it to suck in enough air at the right pressure to use.|`|M6pjHtx5aa	No it couldnt|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	The engines would go out ,Lack of oxygen.|`|ykH93Wyxaa	it would explode as it couldnt cope with pressure or heat|`|vZMN82U8aa	well unless its engines were ram jets, or rockets, its goiing to stall and crash back tot he earth... internal combustion engines require oxygen... and there aint none in space...|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Closest to the edge of space was the X-15. Did it actually enter orbit? That would probably be an American secret :o)    http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/res...|`|mR5ZtjqWaa	jet fighters are powered by turbofan or turbojet engines.  a aircraft powered ONLY by jet engines will not be able to fly into space.       The International federation of aeronautics says that higher than 62 miles, it's space.  This is used because above an altitude of roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi), as Theodore von Krmn calculated, a vehicle would have to travel FASTER THAN ORBITAL VELOCITY in order to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself.   The US designates everybody who travels higher than 50 miles up as astronauts.  75 miles up is when atmospheric drag is first felt by craft re-entering.  Even the lowest of these definitions, 50 miles equals: 264,000 feet.  The highest  jet only aircraft has flown is 125,626 feet (held by Mig-25 Foxbat).    Jet turbine engines are most efficient around 40,000 feet. Most modern military planes have an operating ceiling of 60,000 feet or so.   Basically, for a jet engined plane to fly into space, the engines need to make the plane reach space before they quit from oxygen starvation. Jet engines of the present and near future are incapable of doing this. For one thing, as they go supersonic, the air going down the intake is too turbulent and fixing this problem requires specially shaped inlets.  Ramjets work only at supersonic speeds, so they are not used on jet fighter, but they are also incapable of producing the thrust needed to propel the aircraft into space before quitting from lack of air anyway.    the X-15 reached something like 365,000 feet, which technically, is space. But it was rocket powered, fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.  ===================================  that was the power plant limitations.  should I also mention airframe, pressurization, navigation, control surface, radiation and temperature limitations?|`|3DOSC68naa	Out in space there's no air, how would the jet engines work???|`|AA11131134	Even if it could survive the extreme cold without stalling out the engines, you could never push through into space....in order to break free from Earth's gravity a craft must exceed 17,000 MPH....crazy fast!|`|eFoTrRm4aa	Yes.

AA11537248	HELL NO!    Go to a reputable, privately owned shop.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Are you sure you need an alignment?  It's the most commonly done completely unnecessary repair.  Notice I said "repair" not "maintenance."    If you need an alignment you'll notice one, or both of your front tires has uneven wear on either the inside or outside edge of the tire.  You'll also notice the wear is feathered.    If you're doing the test of letting go of the wheel and seeing which way it goes to see if you need an alignment, stop.  You're actually measuring the crown of the road (most common issue) or sometimes the inflation in the tires or possibly a worn strut or maybe how much one brake lets the wheel spin slightly more freely or torque steer or . . . . without the wear on the tire, it's not the alignment that's causing it.  Alignment shouldn't go out unless you've hit something.  A classic example would be sliding into a curb with the wheel turned on an icy road or maybe a big pot hole.    Alignments are commonly sold by crooked mechanics as "maintenance" because it's something that literally takes less than five minutes that they get to charge $75 for (please don't tell me you've ever paid more than $75.)  The job is literally turning one nut on both wheels.  The term in the shop is "adjust the toe and collect the dough."    Now that I've said all of that, if walmart does it, sure, why not.  Any 16 year old can do this job.  I'd shop for it purely on price.  You can always say no to the tire shop when they tell you it's a good thing you came in when you did.

mTwn8p79aa	It needs a transmission.  The transmission is in 'safe mode' that's meant to limp you to a shop.    With a transmission that's not working that puts it in KBB's "poor" condition.  According to KBB, it's got zero value.  That means they'd expect it to actually cost money to get towed away.    In good condition it's still only worth $1,135.  Good luck getting a transmission installed for $1,135.    Not a good buy, your brother's friend is trying to rip someone off.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	Absolutely not.    Any time there's a "time stamp" (as you stated, "You must buy it now") there's a reason they want to sell it quick. Pass on this. Being stuck in first gear can be one of several costly issues.    And, keep in mind, if you purchase this car, there's no going back. Once you sign the back of the title, it's yours. You cannot return it to him, he does not have to take it back and refund you.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	having a brother in law as a mechanic in my opinion make it worth it.  $200. is fairly cheap, stuck in first gear being an automatic sounds like a linkage problem  that should be easy to correct.  even if you need a transmission (used) would still make it OK.  I think though that you would have to be prepared  to put a few $100. into it.|`|63oSbqZlaa	even if you have to get a transmission, I think 200 is ok for a car like that. Wait to see what the mechanic says and then decide.|`|SCiY5JESaa	check tranny and breaks,$200 is like buying 1 new window for your home|`|pCMxmU0Laa	You will probably have to fix the transmission, that would cost around $1100 to $1500, add that to $200 and the time you would spend fixing it.

If this is a second car, go for it. It could just be a sensor, but if the tranny needs replacing look at about $500 for a used tranny only if your bro is doing the labor. Still a steal... having your bro do the labor for free is the deal maker. The labor for that problem, worst case, would probably run you a grand or so and that's a lot of money saved.    To put this into perspective, if it was me I'd buy it on the spot, no thinking. I'd either fix it or part it out and make probably a couple grand off it.    But, if it's someone that knows nothing about how to fix cars, it could turn into a mess.

Call around to the local tranny shops to get a better estimate.    If your brother-in-law knows how to work on automatic transmissions, it's a deal indeed (this is a very special skill, by the way and takes a lot of special tools and knowledge). If not, you'll have to figure out if the two hundred plus the tranny rebuild is worth it. Offhand I'd say yes. Toyota makes a good car, always has.

AA10503489	Any time you hear a grinding noise when you step on the brakes, you need to have all the brake pads or shoes inspected. This is an indicator that one of the brake pads has worn down to the steel backing, and this is grinding on a brake rotor.    If this only happens on slick surfaces, the sound could be the anti-lock brake system activating, which will make an ugly noise also. If this is the case, usually there will be a light on the dash indicating the ABS is activated.    Even though the sound seems to be coming from the center of the car, sound can travel strangely through the interior and could be coming from one of the brakes. Get them checked out!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it sure sounds like the brake pads. noise can generate. when the sound seems to be in a certain place then it,s someplace else.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	brake pads, drums, rotors......|`|mUSzHFeWaa	It's probably the drugs in your wheel well....|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Sounds like one of the inside pads is gone.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	your brakes

To test the alternator: jump the car to get it running.  Then take off the positive battery cable.  If the car dies, it's the alternator.

AA10503489	You need to look closely around the manifolds and donut gaskets for a blackened area. This will be where the exhaust has been leaking. With the engine running, carefully feel for exhaust blowing from a suspected area.    It's a bit dangerous, but you may need to look and feel around the exhaust from under the car with the engine running to feel or hear the exhaust leak. This is best done on a garage lift, but I have done this in my driveway with ramps and jackstands.    Check the bolts or nuts holding the exhaust pipe to the manifold are tight. I was once ready to have my exhaust replaced until I found that the nuts had backed off and the pipe separated from the manifold.    EDIT: Mike C, I have replaced more cracked manifolds on Chevy V8's than any other engine. It is very possible that it is cracked.|`|db33055e80c5fb6c388a2b981d0caf19aa	Most muffler shops do a free check.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	While the engine is cool like first thing in the morning start it up and run you hands around the manifold feeling for the exhaust coming out. You can also usely see where it's leaking from the black marks on the manifold from the exhaust escaping.|`|WXDyS90Naa	assuming it is an older car, it is more than likely the donut (doughnut)?? It is pretty rare to crack a manifold.|`|EFFI6HlFaa	First off all the above answers are right on the money.  and I agree with junior, I've replaced many cracked manifolds on old chevy's.  One thing I'd like to add is that sometimes it's difficult to see the marks of escaping exhaust (carbon marks).  what I do is while the engine is cooled down I clean the manifold with carb cleaner. wipe off the excess let it dry completely.  once dry I spray the manifold and donut connection with a bright color paint. I use silver. once the paint is dry start the car and drive it around a little bit.  the colored paint will make it a lot easier to see where the exhaust is leaking from.  it should leave black marks at the leak.

4biGrjPkaa	Fiesta/Corsa/Ka or similar are a good place to start, fairly reliable, cheap(ish) to buy and cheap to repair if things go wrong.     Forget about buying anything which is french or italian (peugeot, citroen, renault, fiat, alfa romeo), older ones have lot of common faults and reliability issues.    Some of the japanese cars are a safe bet to buy - nissan micra, honda, toyota, mazda but please avoid hyundai, kia etc    VWs are generally good but can be a little pricey as a first car.    Make sure you get someone to thoroughly check the car before you buy it, by your own admission you dont know what you are looking for and theres plenty of people out there that'll take advantage of this!    Good luck with your new car when you get it!|`|mKVFIklaaa	If you really have no idea, then ask someone who does to actually go with you to auction or look on Ebay for a suitable car.  There are so many variables in buying a first car that it's almost impossible to comment without going on & on about stuff you're just not going to understand. You need to discuss the cost of maintenance, repairs, tax & insurance too - the insurance alone will certainly cost more than the car.    Just an additional comment: It should be obvious to everyone here that you're in the UK, as you have seven hundred POUNDS to spend - be aware that you're bound to still get responses from the US suggesting cars that aren't available here & they also have a completely different set of costs to take into account.    Franklin has just illustrated the point;   is the symbol for British pounds sterling, a currency.  lbs is the abbreviation for pounds in imperial weight, or avoirdupois to give the full name.|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	eBay is not a good idea unless you know what you're looking at.

You have to earn a good no claims bonus over a few years & be over 25 years of age before you can get cheap insurance. So you need to look for cars that are likely to be cheap to insure. This generally means a car with a small engine, so it usually means a small car.  There are a lot of reasonably good cars available, but if your purchase budget is likely to be only around 700, you're not likely to be able to get one of the more popular makes until it's either so old or done such a high mileage that its had most of the life taken out of it. So for example a Ford Fiesta or a Vauxhall Corsa might be a nice car, but you're unlikely to get a good one for very little money. It's possible, but you have to kow what you're looking for.  You'll need a friend who knows about cars to check out any car before buying. In particular you & friend will need to check out that the car has a valid MOT certificate for at least 10 months & the car's service history & do an HPI check to make sure the car's legal history is OK. Don't be put off if the car's been written off & rebuilt. Provided there's nothing obviously wrong, by the time its value drops to around 700, any further problems arising from a previous serious accident will have come to light & should have been attended to anyway. You also need to check for rust (this is what really kills cars), check that the tyres look good with no uneven wear and that all the mechanical bits sound smooth with no knocking, screeching or rattling noises either at idle or when revved & there shouldn't be any visible exhaust smoke.  So if you're looking to spend only a small amount, go for one of the less popular makes. Try these for example. Citroen Saxo, Daewoo Matiz or Kalos, Fiat Punto, Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio, Peugeot 106, Rover 45, Seat Ibiza, Skoda Felicia. You should get a reasoanbly decent one of these for not a lot of money. If you're lucky, you might find one of the better european cars inside your budget e.g. Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall or Opel Corsa, Volkswagen Polo, but because they are popular makes they're more likely to have had most of the life driven out of them. There could also be a few Japanese makes within your price range e.g. Colt, Honda, Nissan, Toyota etc. Again likely to have taken a lot of wear, but generally better lasting (apart from rust) than many european makes. Insurers usually charge more to insure these makes though, so make sure you get a price for insurance before you buy as they could cost as much to insure as a mid-sized european car.  As well as e-bay I'd also check out the auto trader website www.autotrader.co.uk to see what's available. The advantage with auto trader is you won't have committed yourself to buying a car before you've seen it, but then e-bay members risk bad feedback if they sell you a poor item, so check out buyer feedback if you're considering buying off e-bay.  Finally, once you get your car, if it hasn't had a service in the last 6 months, get it serviced at a garage so that it's had a professional check over & they'll advise you if there's anything else that needs attention.  OK I know this sounds like a lot to consider, but it's worth checking out as much as you can before buying so you get the best possible car for your needs, then - HAPPY MOTORING!|`|FArpZsEPaa	Depends on the budget uve got to spend firstly.

I don't recall if the cylinders back then on a Yamaha were sleeved or plated???  if sleeved, possibly could bore to next oversize if there was scoring damage but if plated, would need to send off to have cleaned up and then replated, which could cost $125-200 depending how much clean up was needed.    as far as who could do the top end work, it's pretty simple to do yourself by merely investing in a good shop manual.  after you have done a few times, it becomes second nature ... but any reputable bike shop should be able to install a top end kit ... or any one of your friends that has done the process before a couple of times.    if you can find someone in your local area that maintains their own bikes, invite them over for a few cold beverages to give you guidance... most will gladly walk you thru it as long as you are doing the actual work or at least helping...|`|u0PHhZOSaa	that is an ok deal i would pay $300 for it or less it not worth that much. you can get a running one for that much. but for it being that one the top end would cost around $100 with piston,rings,pin,bearing,gaskets and seals. your local Yamaha dealer should do it for around $50-$100 an hr but they should have it done in less than an hour. but if the cylinder is damaged then your going to need to bored out the cylinders to the next size and get a over sized piston too match. good luck

Next time change the title showing you as a lein holder, then when its completely paid for you give them the title.|`|gEw83TRTaa	This is kind of funny.  First, your brother is an idiot.  A huge idiot.    If YOU sold it to him, but did NOT sign it, then you did not transfer ownership.  The title had to be signed by YOU in order for the car to sell.  If he later transferred the title, without your signature HE is the one who committed a crime.  Either he forged your signature, or he reassigned the title without it.  In either case HE is the one who violated the law with regard to the title.    So, go ahead and go to court.  Let him try to explain how YOU did something wrong.  Until you signed that title, it could not be legally transferred.      Go ahead.  Not only will you win the $500, but possibly more.  The selling price of the car - whatever this second buyre paid, is legally YOURS not his, since it was not HIS car to sell.    He is a moron.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Here's your life lesson here.  Don't give someone a car or a title unless it's paid in full, even family will take you to the cleaner.    Technically you've got nothing to worry about and technically he stole the vehicle from you.  You could press charges for grand theft if you'd like.      Legally he sold your car.  Without your signature on the title, the car is still yours.  If he got more than the grand you had arranged and you plan on taking him to court, I'd go after the money he got for selling YOUR car.  If you want to be a real dirtbag, and why not after what he's done, tell the court he paid you fifty bucks instead of the $500.  I'm betting there were no receipts and it wasn't paid by check.    All of that being said, you've really got to do some soul searching here.  Is it worth taking a family member to court over $500?  It wouldn't be to me.  I'd just have the five hundred dollar lesson learned and never lend him money or do business with him again.  He's family, not a business partner.

r1D9P4Vyaa	What I find on most Buick's with this problem is a dry sway bar bushing. It could also be in the rubber mount at the top of the strut. Both of which can be just lubed to prevent. The worst case could be a dry-ed/rusty lower ball ball joint. As far as struts, They usually will last the life of the car unless you are Off road-en it.To check your struts first look at them, is there any sign of oil seepage by the shaft inside the coil? If so they are Starting to wear. Second try this, Bounce the front of the car up & down hard about 4-times, let go. 1 & 1/2 bounces when let go is Normal. Any more then that, say 3 times then they are getting worn out.  I hope this will help you out some. Good Luck and have a Great Day! =)  Do not let someone say it is big problem it is Not.

Now you could indeed have a problem but it sounds like just a squeak to me. I'm just saying, don't believe all the folks that try to sound smart by acting like you've got this big problem...    G-man offers good advice if you want to try and pinpoint it.|`|uhyq2xlPaa	if it is coming from the front of the car you probaly need struts it wouldnt hurt to change rear shocks/struts either i have owned many buicks and they always gave a smooth ride never bumpy|`|AA11537248	Seems like a rubber bushing squashed someplace in your suspension, and you're now getting metal on metal contact when the car bounces.    It isn't dangerous, just annoying.|`|dbFJW67baa	not sure on the suspension set up on that car but i sounds anti roll bar mounting bush, or top strut mount, i have also seen the lower arm bushes creaking. with out seeing it it could be very difficult to diagnose
nP92OdBzaa	Probably your heater core or your heater valve. The heater core is a major expense, since most likely the dashboard has to be removed. On the heater valve it depends where it's located and how hard to change.  I personally think it's the valve (they regulate how much hot water goes through the heater core)|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Yes, heater core or it's connection. Don't let anyone tell you the dash has to be removed without proving that to you. Most cars can have this done without that, it's just a myth and one of those things people like to say because they think it makes them sound educated about the matter.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if it,s anti-freeze then it,s either the heater core or a heater hose is leaking anti-freeze into the heater core box. but if it,s water then it could be coming from the AC drain tube.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Buying a Ford was your first mistake.

Maybe there are toher suckers out there dumb enough to buy Ford's, too.|`|a0b22cb268673a1f7a7236eae4cc3019aa	The leak is either the heater core or hose attached to it.    Some cars take the antifreeze of the top of the cooling system so if the fluid is low it only pushes air through the system.    If filling the antifreeze gives you heat then you just need to find and fix the leak.|`|uhyq2xlPaa	your heater core is bad the pipes from your heater core extend through your firewall and are usually sealed so i dont believe a leaking hose would cause this problem unless the sealent around the core pipes are bad.
AA11606818	Lets see..who can install a bodykit?    Maybe...a....body......shop???|`|7yhXj3E1aa	you want to make a street racer car? man i hope if your street racing you crash and kill yourself before you kill someone else. keep it on the track.|`|4yfKLAQvaa	Most any body shop or "tuner" shop will do installs. As for the paint, go back to a body shop. Some will want it on the car, others prefer it done separably.   On a side note; if you want to make a "race" car out of it, why add a body kit? Its gonna add weight and aerodynamic drag, ergo, slower. Racing and its winner is typically defined as the one that got there (a predetermined point) first. Which would imply having a faster, more aerodynamic mode of transit.
N9nJWYa5aa	I guess the problem is stopping people from trying to set fire to it and then attaching their mouths to the exhaust pipe!

IIa4efh5aa	Some reviewets have carped about some of the materials used in the interior, but to me, it's like buying a deeply discounted  Infiniti G37. Neat car.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	no no no no!!!!! that dang car is just a copy of the g35 i hate the altima cause everyone thinks they're cool|`|8vZLXB3Saa	Typically, Nissan puts together a good car.  The Altima Coupe is still pretty new, so there isn't much of a reliability history to go by though.  I do know that it is very highly reviewed by several magazines and web sites.  Solid engine choices and a very classy interior for the price.  Back seat is a little bit of a squeeze for a medium to hefty guy like me, but people that buy coupes don't usually end up in their own back seat.|`|0xM4I7dqaa	its practically the same thing as a g35 it has the same motor in it so basically your buying a discounted g35|`|IaHBKA1saa	Nissans are pretty good cars. I know a couple of people that have altimas and like them a lot. It drives pretty well and has decent gas mileage, and will last for a decent amount of time. However some of their warranties are pretty shakey so just read the warranty on the car very carefully before you buy it. Otherwise they are pretty good|`|6WhxVoNxaa	Yeah my friend has the 3.5L v6 and it has 42k miles on it without any problems. And as far as G35 vs A/C goes the coupe is so much better than the G35 it looks better (the rear bumper view can't be beat) and the v6 is faster than the G plus its cheaper on repairs and insurance depending on record. Nissan owns Infinity so no wonder people say they look alike, but looks are subjective to everyone so that is my opinion. It just depends on what you want the car for, i mean if you want performance than the G in the long run with more money invested in to it because it is RWD vs the coupe's FWD.|`|3cacd87eb9418bbb6f572244a17fdd4faa	Nissan Altima is the best car i had. 2001 i bought new. i got hit 3 separate times parked on the street. It still runs like 90% new. Of course all used cars will need little minor maintenance. This was my reason to get the 2008 Rogue. This SUV is so smooth, better than BMW X5.
0OZ9dsUjaa	Sweet ride!  the 99 uses the new big port heads good for 260hp which is a nice improvement over the 215~225hp engines.    19992004 Ford Mustang, 260 hp (194 kW) and 302 lbft (409 Nm)    Hopefully your car has the 5spd cause that's alot funner than the auto but even an automatic is much nicer than any old Z28 Camaro.|`|AA11004209	Though initially used in the 1994 and 1995 Mustang GT, Ford retired the 302 cu in (4.94889 L) overhead-valve small-block V8 after nearly 40 years of use, replacing it with the newer Modular 4.6 L (281 cid) SOHC V8 in the 1996 Mustang GT. The 4.6 L V8 was initially rated at 215 hp (160 kW; 1996-1997) but was later increased to 225 hp (168 kW; 1998). The newer model V6 has the same amount of horses as your v8.

You can check yourself by going to autotrader.co.uk    But the insurance will be very pricy, depending how old you are and since you've only just got your license its going to be very expensive. You should really consider getting something cheaper to keep the insurance price and running costs cheaper.|`|mKVFIklaaa	You'll never get insurance on it, and they're pretty crap cars really.|`|0xM4I7dqaa	www.criagslist.org   check that out they will show you prices|`|4biGrjPkaa	The cheapest place to buy a Focus ST would be from a salvage auction. You would be able to buy an accident damaged one and repair it for a lot less than the cheapest one on Autotrader. However the resale value of the car in the future would be affected and some people have issues with running cars which have been bumped.    I've been buying cars and repairing them in this way for years and I have never had one single car "fall to bits" but I am very selective about what I buy.    Bit of a waste of time telling you this because you'll never insure it, but this is the cheapest way to buy one.     New ST has an old volvo engine, why would you want 1?

VEIkVDtIaa	Did you flush out the brake fluid when you changed the master cylinder?  Typically water in the brake fluid causes the wheel cylinders and calipers to rust inside and that abrasive rust and the water causes the seal failures in the master cylinder.  The brake fluid should always be flushed out and changed when the master cylinder is changed.    beyond that, it could be a poor qualit rebuild on the master cylinder though that's unlikely if it lasted two years.  more likely the contaminated brake fluid that caused the second failure.    hope that helps|`|AA10643879	Mechanic only does the labor,not making the part.Many times it is the owner of the car that want a cheap job.No decent mechanic wants to do the same job twice.At least the thing lasted 2 years.Even an OEM part is not warranted more than a year.|`|KTzBMxSeaa	it's not the mechanic's fault, and it's long since out of warranty on the part.    if you bought an aftermarket or rebuilt, there will be some minor defect enough that it will not perform as an OEM part.  head for the parts department of your nearest Honda dalership, and have a proper mechanic replace the thing for you.  it'll cost a fortune, but you will have had it done properly.|`|DV4xyeChaa	mechanic just puts it in...nothing to blame him/her for....did u get rebuilt?  that might be it,,,and what went wrong,,,|`|PE1k59pcaa	nope blame the manufacture of product.|`|ybh71Dh9aa	yes its the mechanic fault, either taking advantage of you or ignoring the real problem.

If a tractor trailer truck is stopped and a small suv drives into it, the suv would sustain the brunt of the damage. On the other hand if the suv was stopped and the trailer truck hit it, the suv would still bare the brunt od the damage. Now if both were the same size the truck that hits front end to the back end of another the total repair bill would be greater on the truck with frontal damage. If they both hit in the front end the damage on the parked vehicle may be slightly higher but i don't think it would be a huge difference, because they both have progressive crush zones and the stopped vehicle will move on impact.|`|JrKDKkR2aa	The truck at rest will be damaged more.|`|d9672528e10fffc22c5414a30bf28d6baa	People get hurt.

lc1Fm7zJaa	Oh my God, NO!  Now, the highest output alternator I'm familiar with is 160 amps, for the muscle car enthusiast. That being said it is all a matter of the internal design of the alternator ( number of windings, etc...). It requires the exact same "force" to turn a 60 amp alternator! What can change is the external dimensions  (  sometimes up one case size, for example). What is very disappointing is the number of people that will answer with no clue... ( 60 HZ,  AC? OMG! IMPOSSIBLE to do without a constant speed drive! 3600 rpm required to generate 200 amps of 60 cycle AC? Nyuk, Nyuk! What are these folks babbling about? )|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The answer is yes.  Everything else being the same - for more electrical output, more mechanical input is needed.    RPM's are a factor in both the total output and the frequency - for instance, if 60 Hz AC is required at the output without any further electronics, 3600 is the necessary rpm's for the alternator.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	No, the difference is internal, more stator  fields.|`|mTwn8p79aa	It won't have to spin any faster but it will require more torque to turn it.

Draining the fuel tank is ill-advised but if you were to do it, it would require you to lower the tank, but that's dangerous due to the fact that gas is explosive.     You have to lower the tank because it is difficult to access like some vehicles that you could access through the trunk.      However, you have the right parts and feel like you could do this - you could get your Haines manual and it will tell you somewhat.  The problem with kind of guide is that it may not be specific enough.      I am still waiting around for the shop manual (more detailed one that costs around 250 bucks, like from Mopar), but essentially you would need to get a piece of ply wood and jack stands to lower the tank and keep it level and bring it down.    It requires an extensive collection of tools with various wrench sizes and some muscle strength and likely more than one person would need to do the job, especially when working with emissions.    Er- that is after you have disconnected the fuel line, etc.

A deal that good some would say is trouble... but you may have just gotten lucky.    Get it checked out for sure.  If the seller has a problem with a pre-sale inspection, then that's a bad sign.

nP92OdBzaa	You probably got rims with the wrong offset. Offset is if a rim sticks out away from the car or is closer to the car.  Each car model can only accept a certain range of offset to avoid what happened to you.  First, your 15" tire is the wrong size to replace the 185/65/14. You should have gotten a 195/55/15  If you don't want to get new rims with the correct offset (where your 195/55/15 would be no problem), then your only choice would be a 185/55/15, but that's a oddball size, probably expensive.  On this site you can learn a lot about tire sizes and al the stuff that goes with it:  http://www.1010tires.com/TireSizeCalcula...  http://www.1010tires.com/tech.asp    Just a point to dtried....there is NO such size as a 190/60/15|`|WwXrTQgaaa	First off you need to understand how the sizing works.    The 195 is the width, in millimeters.  The 60 is the height of the sidewall, in percentage of the width.  ...and of course the last   is the rim size.    195/60 = a 195mm wide tire with a sidewall height of (.60 x 195 = 117mm).    So, to keep your odometer right, you need to be at, or close to, 117mm in sidewall height.    You want narrower so just knock some off the width... try a 190 or back to 185. Now this will change the second   ... you want to stay at 117mm so 117/185 = .63. You won't find a 185/63 so you'll either go a little taller with a 185/65 or a little shorter with a 185/60. Being that 65 is closer to 63 than 60, I'd go with the slightly taller tire. It's a very minute amount anyway.    So, you can try a 185/65/15 or a 190/60/15... if you can't find either then you'll have to play with the formula some more.    Hope this wasn't too confusing.  Keep in mind that due to poor tolerances by tire makers, these numbers will seldom be the exact measurements of the tire.    Spacers are junk for ricers that value looks over performance.    Wow, bobweb. The entire question is based solely on the changing of rims.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	The problem isn't your tires.  Its the wheels.  They are not correct for the car.  There is no way a P195/60R15 87_ tire should rub on this car with a properly offset wheel.  This why when installing new wheels you should always mount a tire on just one first and test fit that wheel and tire on all four corners to check for clearance.    You need different wheels.  No spacers.  Nothing good can come from using them.|`|WXDyS90Naa	Nothing you do will look very good,but... try a 175 or a spacer. Vehicles nowadays are made for a very specific rim and tire size and require alot of customization to change.|`|AA10331789	You should only buy the OEM tire sizes available from your tire dealer for your car unless you change the rims.    http://www.eastwoodco.com/jump.jsp?itemI...    http://www.samsclub.com/shopping/navigat...|`|AXNkmdbKaa	How about a 185/65 R15?  I think whoever installed your previous tires should have noticed a rub bad enough to explode a tire.  So should you.  The above tire should be the same as your previous 14 inch tire except for the hole in the middle.  So if your 15 inch rims have the right offset everything should be the same.  Right?|`|4yfKLAQvaa	Whats the OE size? Tire.com or tirerack.com have online tire selection computers that will help determine what size will work on a given vehicle.    As for spacers, its advisable to run longer wheel studs. The OE lenghts aren't designed to accomadate added depth|`|BEUR4Pm4aa	PLEASE PEOPLE, DON'T GIVE ADVISE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!!!  Mikey, the overall diameter increases more than an inch from a  185/65/14 to a 185/65/15. The numbers aren't just numbers, they actually mean something!!!
muPiBQ3Uaa	Has to be done with a TECH II scantool or the MDI, both at the GM dealer. There is no way to program the keyless entry without the special tools.    Edit to add---Chris---nope. Cant be done. It must be programmed with a TECH II or the MDI using GM TIS2WEB. And I dont care how many "thumbs down" you give, it wont change the truth----and the truth is, you dont have a clue what you are talking about.|`|AA11914369	I am afraid that this remote has to be programmed by a local dealer or a professional automotive locksmith( they are usually less expensive), you can find a list of those guys in the local yellow pages under locksmith in your area.|`|LamVaAETaa	Google it. I do not know how but i am pretty sure you can do it w/o a dealer or locksmith.|`|429939106b841019e298ad9b2c794524aa	Check keylessride .com They want you to buy a remote from them but if you look around on their site they will tell how to do it or if your model must be done at the dealership. Good luck!|`|D6t6SoFRaa	have all remotes to be used  turn vehicle on (do not start)  press vehicle info button until PRESS TO RELEARN REMOTE KEY is displayed.  press setreset button until REMOTE KEY LEARNING ACTIVE is displayed  press and hold lock and unlock buttons on first remote for 15 seconds, tone will confirm success.  repeat for each remote.  turn off to end program mode
GTBh6MFMaa	If you have an Autozone in your town they will diagnose it for free and believe it or not should have the part you need, I will bet as cold as it is it is most likely a mis fire.

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	blue smoke is oil burning, get the valve seals checked out, sounds like there going bad.|`|AA11273149	oil burner!!  Probably a small amount of oil is leaking by your valve stems while the car sets overnight and enter the combustion chamber, then when you crank the car the oil is burned off, thus blue smoke.|`|bW931jBaaa	Are you sure it is blue? If it is white smoke, that would just be condensation in the exhaust.  If it is blue, and only does it at start up, that is blow by oil. The car could use a valve adjustment  It is not a big deal as long as you check your oil when you get gas|`|GpWT465Iaa	ya your burning oil. thats what it usually is.|`|OtYAkRrRaa	Blue smoke usually means you're burning oil.

VTtka1ubaa	You may not like this answer, but here it is.  It is available on line in cliff notes format.  In other words, GM offers owners manual online in PDF format that have part of the owners manual.  It is just the safety, controls, and a few other features in the PDF version.  It is not the maintenance recommendations as that is located elsewhere on the site.    To get to it, you need your VIN number to identify your car.  Then go to the following site: http://gmownercenter.yahoo.com/    Once you login to the site for the first time with your VIN number, in the upper left hand corner of the page where it says "My dashboard" right underneath where your car is listed with the VIN number you have entered, is a button labeled, "Get to know your 9-3."  Click on that button.  Then a 10 MB file will download with the PDF of your owners manual.  Hope that helps.

8ZmPfacsaa	lol those subs are rated at 750 WATTS RMS    get a kicker zx1500.1 amp, or anything that can put out that many watts at 2 ohms (or 1 depending how the impendance of your subs) doing this will give the 2 (or 1) ohm load (depdning on if their 2 ohm or 4 ohm dvc version) it will give this load 1500 watts which each sub will get the 750 watts they need    your friend is an idiot.|`|NzIoJlNUaa	It will work but your subs will only be getting about half the power they need.  Those subs will take 750 watts rms each.|`|gstBWswfaa	lol  with that amp you will be powering them at 850 outta 1500  Personally i would want a different amp.|`|0xM4I7dqaa	yeah that would be good and if you want more power out of the amp you can also bridge it|`|ESTn9B3xaa	he just wants to sell it man.. that amp could power 1 of them, it would overpower it a bit but it is only good enough for one...  each sub takes 750 rms  that amp puts out 850 rms    so by using it to power both your losing a lot of power..   go with a bigger amp like the zx1500.1  that would be your best match to fully push those subs
eFxUORkmaa	The whole worth it concept I would say is whether you are fixing up the car to sell it or if you fixing it up for a badass appearance. I would say if your planning on selling it it's probably not worth the investment as far as getting you money back out of it. If you're fixing it up and plan on keeping it then absolutely, spend the money and get it like YOU want it.   The National Firebird and Trans Am club has some awesome links and forums for working on any model T/A and some great links to parts, new and used. As a T/A  fanatic myself I would recommend checking them out, it can def. be a big help on hunting parts down.     http://www.firebirdtaclub.com/    Best of luck to you on your project.|`|SsB7aRExaa	I wouldn't put a $500 paint job on an 85 Trans Am.  We're not talking about a classic by any stretch of the imagination.  The 80's were just NOT good years for American cars.  Mediocrity ruled.  Treat it as basic transportation, nothing more.  Keep up the maintenance, keep it clean, be glad you don't have a car payment, and just drive it, don't worship it.|`|8zVxYkluaa	No, for the sake of Fbody owners worldwide please don't bastardize it lol.    Also, what Miiiikeeee said.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Those cars look good as manufactured.  Just get it repaired.  A body shop should be able to fix that bumper cover with not trouble, just $$$ needed.  But way less than $1500 - $2000 not counting labor to install.|`|n1GeI9Woaa	It's your car, and if you like it and want to keep it, go for the body kit. The comment about American cars from the '80s: WHATEVER! They might not have had the power of the '60s musclecars, but they are perfectly adequate for daily transportation, and were dependable and easy to work on. The Olds Cutlass still outsold the foreign crap in the beginning of the decade.|`|0SlYZRSuaa	No the car is pretty old don't waste your money|`|88ca921e0c252f3cf12e19d369f73438aa	Me, a t/a owner since 1982 would not put a body kit on it. it only ruins the look, They never fit correctly either. You can get a junk yard one for about 150.00. spend the rest on a paint job , You could have a nice looking car if spent that 2k on fixing it up.
rnVdxXotaa	Their OK but they do have a tendancy to get small faults like electrics, mirrors, etc. But they are quite reliable|`|n43DN6Duaa	No its a bag of s***, ive had mine 3months and already had to have fan belt changed, exhaust fallen off. loads of things mnage to be goin wrong. but may be just bcus the guy who had it didnt appreciate it, your choice though.     If ur buying a used one too check out parkers.co.uk for the prices. Cus i found alot of 206 owners are trying to get more money for them than there worth.|`|M6pjHtx5aa	Yeah they're good reliable car's.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Yes, pretty average. The diesels are far more reliable than the petrol models.|`|UkzeJQY5aa	good little car
TdrgZwnoaa	This engine will safely produce about 230 HP before it spits its guts out all over the road and up through the hood. Anything more than that will require serious internal modifications and a different transmission..|`|5kVyZyGGaa	if your really going to turbo the car don't twin turbo it because it would just be a waste of money so your best bet is to put single turbo or supercharger. and  yeah you would get something like 230 hp safely on about 4-8 psi.|`|DydFQ0fcaa	You can only run 8psi of boost if your engine is stock. So as-is, you can get about 220hp (safely) with a turbo.
uMKuOlFNaa	Dodge neons are not a very durable vehicles. In fact, 50k miles is almost 1/2 the life of these cars. YOU WILL REGRET buying a Dodge Neon.   You would be better investing in a used Honda or toyota (maybe you are an american car buyer, but you are investing in a used vehicle) Anyway, not getting a warranty just to save 1500 in kinda silly.   I work in auto appraisals with salvage yards and (with tow companies that distinguish what vehicles can be deemed derelict and what ones are "fit" to sell) I tell you, back in 2001 one company had 5 neons (between the year of 95 and 96) All were crushed due to major components not working properly- Engines bad, transmissions bad. The cars LOOKED good, until you took a look under that hood.   Good luck with your neon.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	There are some times that a warranty transcends ownership from one person to another. You can probably purchase an extended warranty, but you'll have to check with the manufacturer about that. You cannot obligate the private seller to provide any type of warranty because these are "as is" deals.|`|geih5vR8aa	No, a dealership isn't going to be stupid enough to give you a warranty for a car they didn't sell you.  If the car had a 5 or 10 year warranty when it was originally purchased, then it will still be good when you buy it.  I HIGHLY doubt that the original purchaser got an extended warranty though. You can find 3rd party warranties somewhere, but I have no clue if they're any good or not.    $9,500 is an ok deal on it. Blue book on that car is between $10,500 and $12,500      But, to be honest, if the car looks like it's in good shape, you better run a carfax report, cuz it may be a salvaged title, or have been in an accident. Looking online, I see people selling there SRT-4's for over $16,000 - $18,000, and one of them has 70,000 miles on it.    If not, then the guy is getting rid of it for some reason. Could be that he lost a job and needs money.    Check the carfax report, and take it to a mechanic to have it checked out to see if there are any hidden mechanical problems, like oil leaking somewhere.    Oh, and if you're looking online at this car, it could be a scam. I've seen this scam going around where people put good deals online, and then you contact them, and they say they're going to go through ebay to sell you the car, because they're on some vacation and can't come home. Then they say to send the money to a place in San Jose, and ebay will hold the money and he will send you the car, and you inspect the car. If you like it, then you keep the car, and ebay sends you the money... lol    THAT'S NOT HOW EBAY SELLS CARS! You send the dude a money order, and then you never hear from anyone again.|`|xBzVBZyOaa	big mistake yoou kno y|`|pp4KpJ3Waa	The dealerships sell you a warranty as a 3rd party. It generally isn't the dealership's warranty but another company's they are selling on commission. Google "extended automobile warranty" and purchase one. I believe, as do many, that extended warranties are a joke and 99% of the time are pure profit for the one who sold you it.|`|04Te5gzzaa	First and foremost...before you buy this car, make sure you have it checked out by a mechanic of your choice.  Spending like $50-$100 to have it checked for any defects or possible future maintenance work or prior accident damage will be well worth it.  Buying from a private seller is a buyer-beware situation...once you paid for it, there's no return policy.    Since this car is no longer covered under the original factory warranty you won't be able to get an extended warranty from Dodge.      Basic:  3 yr. / 36,000 mi.  Drivetrain: 3 yr. / 36,000 mi.  Roadside: 3 yr. / 36,000 mi.  Rust: 5 yr. / 100,000 mi.    You can buy 3rd party extended warranties that are available online.  Be sure to read through the webpage below to get additional information before you go out and buy one.  There's alot of scams and companies that will have strict rules on what is covered and what is not.
jYy6dDAZaa	Amps and subs are both rated in Watts, so a 2,000 watt amp can carry 10 200watt subs or 4  500 watt subs, anything that doesn't exceed 2000.|`|PhpzZIQfaa	http://mobile.jlaudio.com/support_pages....     and it show 6 subs on one mono amp but the amp has to handle the ohms.|`|PWuWfc7vaa	best thing is to hook up 2 subs in 1 amp but if u say u hav 2 6.5 subs then i guess u can hook up 1 more and get decend sound

What an absolute piece of trash the driver was.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	How far? If he merely pulled it a little way forward so he could access the front to hook the truck up, no problem. If he dragged it on down the road with the wheels locked up - I would have a serious problem with that.
ZNhP3mpUaa	WHY DO YOU KEEP BUYING FOREIGN CARS!!! You can get a 02-04 Chevy Cavalier for that price and those things drive forever. and if something DOES go wrong, it's dirt cheap to fix cause there's 5 million on the road... foreign cars are nice, but the most expensive to repair.    i agree with the guy up there, but stay away from dodge/chrysler products... widely known for bad tranny's.    PS you aren't going to find a VW for 3-4 grand unless its 15 years old.|`|IIa4efh5aa	Imports are always costlier to repair and maintain than the domestic brands.

YlLdIPRvaa	Depends on what their termination agreement policy states.  You may get a percentage of the deposit back.  If car sales were not taking a hit, they would probably be able to sell the car you ordered no problem.  But it may have to sit on the lot for a while means they will be less likely to forgive you for wanting to walk away from the deal.|`|mTwn8p79aa	With having a car custom built to your specifications, I doubt it.|`|8SvAoq0Vaa	There are 2 aspects to your question.  One is the agreement with the finance for the Mercedes and the other is the purchase of the car itself.  In other words they are creating seperate legal obligations.     When you signed the order form for the Mercedes then, in the absence of anything which spoils the contract - missrepresentation etc. you are legally bound by it.  You stated "they said the car will be here in 2 weeks".  Has it not arrived within that time frame?  If so you can sue for breach of contract as this is a condition under the Sale of Goods Act 1996.  In that case you cannot obtain a refund on your desposit but this would depend on the terms of your contract.  What did it say?    Due to the fact you have not sigend the finance agreement you are not legally bound by it because all transactions for credit etc. must be in writing to be legally valid.     Was the finance for the car conditional upon the purchase?       Sorry I cannot give a fully valid answer as it requires more in-depth information but I hope this helps!|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	No, you placed an order and secured it with a deposit.  If you back out, you lose the deposit.  That's what it's for.|`|yNbGq4viaa	How did the financing go through if you haven't signed anything?  Normally you have to sign an application, etc. before they can even run your credit; however, if you haven't actually taken possession of the car then you can probably still cancel it.  There may be penalties that are charged.  You will need to call your bank and the dealership and speak with a finance manager to find out.  You may need to get an attorney involved depending on their reaction.
p3NW0Mstaa	Many reason to go blind in a car crash.  Glass in the eyes would be the first to come to mind, or fire, blow to the right part of the brain, loss of Oxygen may be a contributing cause.    And on the poison part, I know a few site due to the nature of my job, but I am in Safety and use that for helping people in need.   I don't think you need help there..|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Cause and Effect.    - glass in the eyes  - ruptured eye ball  - severed optical nerve  - detached retinas  - damaged corneas  - total loss of the eyes  - blunt force trauma to the optical centre in the brain  - brain hemorrhage       For poisons just 'GOOGLE' poison control centre. There are hundreds of them.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, you can go blind from a car crash, and you can end up in a coma.  The way this happens is due to the impact of the crash.  Blindness can happen from shards of glass that penetrate the eye and that can cause you to lose sight.  In a car crash if the impact is great enough to cause serious injury to your spinal cord or your brain, then you can suffer from a coma.  When your head is injured in a collision then your brain is damaged causing you to lose consciousness and you can end up in a coma.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Either from something hitting you or your brain in your head is snapped back and forth very hard or its just your time for this too happen..
uMKuOlFNaa	Dave and Nap are right. The replacement title supersedes the original. You need to get to the DMV ASAP  He can forge your name on the title and put you through a whole lot of heartache. What a jackass, huh?|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	Go to DMV and ask for a replacement title. You are the registered owner unless he forged your name on the title and in that case, he's going to jail for forgery and grand theft.    If he has your car, you can have the police retreive it as a stolen car|`|BGPa2DqYaa	The one and only thing to do is just file for a duplicate title. Right away. This automatically makes the stolen one Null & Void. Only the higher of the title numbers is the one that is valid. So, don't worry.Unless you just let It go then He or whoever can claim the car was sold to them but they would never get away with It. The only thing is the aggravation to reclaim It. So, go right away and file.Good Luck|`|7BwKdVfTaa	Go too the court house and fill for a lost title|`|SuZbBnycaa	The fee for Duplicate title is $18 in California. Always keep in a safety deposit box or somewhere safe....never in the car.     Forgery is a felony.     You can do this at the DMV or AAA Auto Club.  You will need the registration or plate number. and REG 227 form

T1OFtmB5aa	If you've already taken her to small claims court and she failed to appear, you won by "default judgment".  Then you file a "proceedings supplemental" that makes it where she is court ordered to appear or she can be held in contempt.  They basically will rule you as sole owner in most cases, and the title can be modified by court owner.  If she is found driving that car states away from you and pulled over, it at that point can be marked as a stolen vehicle, although they most likely will just impound it and give it back to the rightful owner.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Sounds like a plan - you might do the nice thing and let her know your intentions (via her friends, parents, etc.) before they arrest her for Grand Theft Auto which is a serious felony.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	first off if you were a co-signer on the loan your title work should match and depending on the way it is written ( ie sue smith and joe jones as opposed to sue smith or joe jones ) it would depend if she even needs to sign the title. I wouldn't even think of signing for someone i didn't know well enough to know where they lived or worked though. Here is another tid bit, a judgment can be levied on someone but then you still have to collect so good luck there too. Keep 1 more thing in mind if she wrecks the car you own a wrecked car and if you are paying the insurance premium you may have liability there too.

VEIkVDtIaa	If its a Honda Civic you don't have a clutch cable--the clutch is hydraulic.    chances are you have a leak in the clutch master cylinder or clutch slave cylinder or the clutch is worn out (though typically the clutch engages at the very top when its worn out).    look in the engine compartment to the left of the brake master cylinder.  you'll find the clutch master cylinder.  if it is low on hydraulic fluid as I imagine it will be then you refill it with DOT 3 brake fluid.    you'll need to find out where the fluid went.  typically its either the clutch master cylinder or the slave cylinder ont he transmission end that is leaking.  you can replace them separately though most technicians want to replace them as a set for "insurance'    hope that helps|`|mKVFIklaaa	Check the cable isn't kinked, but it may just be that the clutch is harder than you're used to: Has an uprated pressure plate been fitted?  Being low to the floor is fine, but the cable should be correctly adjusted.|`|AA11926170	seized cable or clutch pressure plate
Yb72J5zDaa	I have an 04' F150 (new body) too.I have the same problem too.This has been a problem with the intake system on the F150 on the 04-up models with the 5.4L in it.Not sure on the 4.6L.I have read this in many forums.If you have a cold air intake on your truck,the whistling will be louder.I really didnt notice my whistling until i put the cold air intake on my truck however i have read of this being a problem with even the F150's with stock air boxes.There isnt any thing wrong with your truck.Most newer F150's have this problem.Type "F150 whistling" in your search bar and it will come up with lots off stuff.Your right! It does happen more often when its cold out.As far as i know,there is no fix for this.If you happen to stumble across somewhere that someone did fix the problem,send me an email please.I too would like to know how to fix it.I think Ford actually new about the problem when the truck was sold to the public because if you look at the stock airbox where to air filter is installed,there is actually some foam that was stuck around the slide part that holds the filter in place near the clamps.    edit-- there is also a good answer below me(atvman).I too was wondering about that small hole in the airbox but never bothered with it because even when you put an aftermarket cold air intake on the vehicle,the whistling still happens.|`|7BmMT50oaa	ITS A FORD -- SO ITS GARBAGE|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	My mom's Explorer did this, after 15 minutes of searching I found that it was comng from the drain hole on the bottom of her air box. I would check that first.|`|EmgiGg17aa	There is an automatic choke plate or flap on the air cleaner(which directs which way the air is to be drawn from)either the engine compartment above, or past the exhaust manifold -  which warms up first as the engine runs and keep delivering the warm air until the engine is up to operating temperature sooner and then flaps over to draw the air from the engine compartment instead of past the manifold(which is more restrictive and a longer route).  Warm air helps the gas to burn better and the engine runs leaner sooner.    You may have a situation where the directional plate is sticking in the "from the manifold" position.    BTW: where is the cat?|`|N7LlOAcOaa	because its a piece of crap ford!?!?! duh? these trucks are the cheapest but you get what you pay for....atleast you tranny didnt go out at 30,000 miles like my friends 07 F150|`|28ESRGPOaa	depends where the whistling is coming from. could be something as simple as just road salt in the rotors or if its in the engine it could be a Serpentine belt. if it goes away after the truck gets warm its usually not a big deal
7H7cXTvGaa	1. Head Unit (stereo) - phoneer 3050. (approx 3.5 K INR) in grey market.     Front - 4.5 / 4 inch speakers - starting from 750 INR a pair. (Ideal budget - 1500 INR - look for Blaupunkt / JBL speakers - insist on bills)    Rear 6 x 9 ovals - starting from 1500 INR. (Ideal budget is 3.5 K INR). Ask for pioneer, blaupunkt and jbl - in increasing order of cost.|`|0tLg12voaa	Since alto is a small hatch back , u must not go for sub.that's my first suggestion.    About head-unit -  go for 'Pioneer DEH-4000UB USB CD/MP3 Car Radio Car CD Player' .Always remember that the display should be in green colour , pioneer usually come with green display & those in red are fake .     For speakers - use 2 'oval 4-way JBL @ rear & 2 round door speakers of JBL/SONY-XPLOD on front doors" . never go for pioneer speakers as their speakers are of low quality.    another way - alittle more expensive one is to go for a component-preferabely JBL/kenwood.     one fact i want to tell u is that proper tuning of ur head-unit is a must for good performance of ur speakers.Also use a good cable for connecting speakers to head unit.    I think this will help you as the former is from my own past experience.

You could try my sources for any help they may be able to give.|`|6bc8356604557667c776ceb4e4a5935aaa	you can try and try but the only way you will get one is by paying for it sorry you can download one from electronic manuals.com for about 10 pound|`|KTzBMxSeaa	generally, due to copyright reasons, shop and repair manuals are not available online, even in the US.  scanned copy's of manuals are considered copyright theft.  you must pay for the appropriate book and have a hard copy.  some manufacturers do sell a CD based repair book, but usually only to certified mechanics.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	try typing     repair manual 2001 Fiat Punto PDF

gQWFEGuaaa	You will find that the filter in the bottom of the washer bottle is blocked. Will need to take bottle out and have it cleaned out!!|`|v6NdNE4xaa	get your local garage (mechanic not petrol garage) too blow through your lines with a airline to clear blockage will take 2 secs|`|703bc749e7392662f2634ebb326a9bcdaa	Either the pipes will be kinked or split somewhere, or the actual washer jets themselves are blocked. If the jets are the older type with a little metal ball inside them, they can usually be cleared by sticking a pin into the tiny holes. If they're the plastic ones, the best course of action is to replace them, since sticking pins in them often makes them worse. They only usually cost a couple of quid each.|`|4biGrjPkaa	Trace the pipes back from the jets on the underside of the bonnet to the pump, I'd bet one of them is split. The jets may have a blockage too but its unlikely you'd get much of a "squirt" if that was the case.    hope this helps|`|dbFJW67baa	make sure they are not frozen for a start, pull the pipe off the back of the jet and squirt it away from you. if it squirts its the jet is blocked. If not squirt the washers for several seconds and check under neath for and drips if there is there is a split in the pipe

In a properly built ported enclosure the Type-Rs will excel.  If you are looking for deep bass then you would want an enclosure tuned pretty low.    If you are willing to give up most of your trunk then I would suggest you go with a ported enclosure.  If you want to save space then a sealed enclosure will work and still give you the low end you are looking for.  It just won't give you quite as much output as a ported enclosure would.    Good Luck!!!
k3PPULbMaa	Its not too bad to replace, but it does mean removing the front bumper, as the headlamp retaining bolts are hidden behind it. the bumper is held on by a series of clips and some 10mm bolts, then it just un-clips from the front wings. good luck
5xxuKzXPaa	pull the cap off of the old, set aside, disconnect the wires to the distributor (not the cap), remove the hold down clamp. the distributor should pull out really easily now but pay attention to the position of the distributor so that you can install the new one on close position to the old one. slide the new one in and clamp it down. reconnect the wires, install the cap and restart. you will need to double check timing at this point. you will have to look up the procedure for your car. i have done this on my car in about 5 minutes. it is not hard to do at all. on some distributors the timing gear will only drop in, in one position, others you have to pay attention to the position of the rotor when you pull the first one out and match that one up on installation.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	take the hold down bolt out, take the harness off and look to where the rotor is pointing at and drop the new distributor down in the same way the old 1 came out. put the hold down bolt back in and hook up the harness.|`|QdzecSwdaa	If its just the distributor cap, its about a 5 minute job.....if you actually have to replace the entire distributor, I recommend a manual for your car that you can get at an auto parts store, it will have the step by step directions that will take forever to understand via yahoo answers|`|f5ibT3WNaa	IF you disconnect the battery and take all of the electrical wires lose not the plug wires, take the distributor cap off and lay it off to the side. Note where the rotor is pointing and mark it with a marker. Then look at where the distributor is sitting on the engine and mark it with something pointy. Take the bolt out of the clamp holding the dist. in and rotate the dist. out. Transfer the marks aas close has possible to the new dist. and repeat the process in reverse. It might be a little difficult to make the dist. go back into the same exact place but it will just be easy and take you time. No BFHs|`|56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	Nice to know what kind of vehicle you have.  Take the distributor cap off and set the motor to  1 cylinder.  Mark the distributor housing with a Sharpie pen to match the center of the rotor location. Mark the motor,intake manifold, etc. to also line up with the mark you made on the distributor housing so you know that the distributor housing is in the same position when the new one is replaced.  Remove the distributor watching where the rotor moves to when pulling the distributor out.  Put the new distributor rotor in the same position that the old one went to upon removal. Align the new distributor housing as close as possible to the mark on the motor, referring to the old housing mark.  When the new distributor is all the way in, the rotor must point to the mark you made on the motor. If not pull the distributor up until you can turn the rotor a notch and push the distributor back down again.  After putting everything back together, set the timing according to specs with a timing light making sure to ground out or jump any timing reference wires so that TDC can be set. Vacuum lines must be removed and plugged on most older vehicles before setting TDC.
9uAYLQz8aa	1800lbs dry weight............is it a Lance or wilderness, traveleez?? If it is a 10 foot cab over it will be too heavy for a 1/2 ton pick up. But, if you choose to install it you will have to modify the rear suspension with heavier leaf springs or Air bags, Shocks and larger sized tires (load range "D" or "E") to carry the load. The largest camper you can install on a 1500 or 1/2 ton pick up is a 8 foot model and you still will have to modify the rear suspension a little.
sCqdisvnaa	The reason fwd is perceived as superior in the snow is because of the superior initial traction due to the weight of the engine being over the front wheels.  Actually, for this reason, a rear engine rear wheel drive car is even better than a fwd car, because not only is the weight of the engine over the drive wheels, but the weight transfer that naturally occurs under acceleration shifts the weight balance rearwards, too.  That's why the original VW Beetle was such a great snow car.  It was even advertised as "what the snowplow driver drives to get to work".    Many people are uncomfortable with rwd in the snow because they don't like the feeling of the car oversteering, and the rear sliding, but the reality is all cars slide around in the snow.  A fwd car in particular is likely to understeer, so that you turn the wheels, but the car keeps going straight.  For an inexperienced driver the natural reaction is to slow down/brake, which will reduce the understeer, so it's a less scary experience.    If the conditions are truly slippery, though, then snow tyres are the answer.  They make all the difference, whether the car is rwd, fwd or even awd.  I personally experienced this when driving my rwd BMW with snow tyres.  I was stopped at a traffic light, on a hill.  In the next lane, a Toyota Camry (fwd), presumably on all season tyres.  5-6 inches of snow and slush.  I was able to get the BMW up the hill, from a standstill, without drama thanks to my snow tyres.  The Toyota sat there spinning its wheels.    Personally, I love driving a rwd car in snow, with the right tyres.  The traction to get you going, and the ability to slide the car around and have some fun when its safe to do so.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Yes my BMWs slide all over the place because I want them too.  BS to front wheel drive being better in the snow.  TO the nervous Nelly drivers fwd is fine for them.  They do have a little better ability to  get going from a stop on snow and ice.  But once you get to speed its not good.  There is almost no weight in the butt end of a front wheel drive car.  And they slide COMPLETELY around easily on a turn also if they are bumped slightly the car will spin COMPLETELY around.  A good example of that is COPS Tv show watch the Front WD cars and whamo one hit and the car spins.  Then the RearWD cars and it take a good two or three tries with a bigger impact needed for the pit maneuver to happen.  Confident drivers prefer Rear wheel drive when its a choice of Front wheel drive only or a rear wheel drive only car.  To an experienced driver using the sliding to your advantage overcomes any front wheel drive car slight advantage of being able to get going from a stop.  BMWs are typically a 50/50 weight distribution 50 on the front wheels and 50 on the rear.  Most other rear WD cars do not have a 50/50 weight distribution.  Where I live there snow is a rare occurrence and we just had the biggest snow in 25 years.  The most annoying part about getting around on the snow was having to pass Front Wheel Drive 20mph nervous Nelly's.  Or driving around stuck Front wheel drive cars stopped on a hill.  I sold a car to a guy who was impressed how my car was tooling all around town and passing stuck 4X4 trucks.  He soon learned its the driver that made that possible.|`|8oG11Mq4aa	Yes pretty much, before I got these new Kumho Platinum's and it does a lot better.      Plus I have anti-lock brakes ... so I always stay far behind people in bad conditions because it slides for a bit.  But they help me out a lot!    I have a 535I|`|6ypXMb1jaa	My fiance's 1999 M3 is absolutely horrendous in the snow.     But one must understand that it was not made for the snow. It was made for performance and racing. The car has guts, not grip.    Now, my fiance's 2008 535xi wagon is of course, 4 wheel drive and does beautifully in the snow. It rarely slips or slides in the snow. We have had some snow here and it's been excellent. It will be interesting next year if we get a real snowstorm.    The 1974 2002tii that the fiance owns has never ever been driven in the snow so I cannot answer that for that particular vehicle. It was a California car before moving east. :)|`|AA10859773	Nah.  I grew up with honkin' big RWD cars and never had a problem.  Then for a while I had FWDs.  Now I'm in a BMW and I have seen very little difference between it and my SHO.  If anything it's slightly better but that may be because I have snow tires on and the SHO had all seasons.    My husband swears by FWD but I can't tell the diff.    I live in Milwaukee.|`|175ydQo5aa	Lets just say my e90 is like driving a super fast bobsled. and I have upgrades tires too, rain is no better, it always wants to go sideways, which is quite fun so im ok with it.|`|0lBwS4QFaa	Front wheel drive is a lot better than rear wheel drive in snow and ice.

sCqdisvnaa	205/65-R15 tyres have an approximate overall diameter of 25.49".    245/40-R18 tyres have an approximate overall diameter of 25.72"    245/40-R19 tyres have an approximate overall diameter of 26.72"    So irrespective of looks, the 245/40-R18's are the right tyre.  By themselves, the wheels/tyres won't lower the car, so you'll need springs to do that.  Just don't slam it so far that you compromise the handling of the car by messing up the suspension geometry.  H & R Sport springs or Eibach's are  typically a good compromise in terms of lowering the car for looks, and maintaining the handling and still having an acceptable ride quality.    Also consider that you need to be sure to get quality wheels:  hubcentric (i.e. centered by the wheel hub, to avoid vibrations), and with the right offset to make sure the tyres don't rub.  I recommend the Tire Rack as a great resource for getting good quality wheels that will fit without issues, at fair prices.    One other point to consider is that 18" wheels are typically heavier than 15" wheels, so you may end up increasing the rotational mass of the wheels.  This may have a small impact on acceleration.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	no dont mess with the suspension, ur ride will suck. Dont go too big on the rims cuz u will feel every bump in the road. Get wide tires, they look good on BMWs|`|YLajQcFkaa	Widest you should ever go is 225 and thats it.  When you go wider the car will pull all over the road and become annoying to drive.  For some reason most tire stores go with 205's and its to narrow.  225 is the sweet spot for performance and a good feel to the driver.  I have found over the years these cars don't handle to well with shorter sidewalls when you would think it would handle better.  Its just nature of the beast here.  As to lowering there are some drawbacks.  If you lower it the rear tires will wear fast in the insides.  You have to make sure you have good struts to avoid oil pan damage.  Then you have to make sure you stop short of the parking curb in parking lots or the lower air dam will get scraped and crunched.|`|MJRRUYXZaa	I'd love to tell you after seeing pix of your ride currently before she wears the new shoes .. I can't however judge by word .. so if you emailed me pix of your car I'll tell you what I think you should do .. or even after you put on the new rims.    generally though converting from a 15er to a 19er is def. gonna show in terms of ride quality ... lowering it "I think" is only gonna worsen it ... so once you have the new rims on (with whatever choice of tires you ended up with) make sure it hasn't gotten really stiff .. and if it did .. don't increase the stiffness by lowering it.    one other thing is, widening your rim+tire will probably lower the HP on your car.    finally ... make sure the gear box doesn't have problems with your new set of rims and tires.    not an expert though, so don't take my comments seriously just pass them on to someone who you think knows better.|`|XixWPZZsaa	I have done work on other BMW's (including the very same model E34 that you have) to correct camber issues with larger rims. This particular suspension will not be good with any rims larger than 18".  I have 18" 7 series 5 spoke M wheels on my 92 7 series which has pretty much the same suspension. Camber plates absolutely had to be installed to correct for extra positive camber new rims and wider tires provided. Unless you take your car to advanced driving courses or to the track - do not do it. You can run 17 inch rims without major mods like these. BMW's have great steering and suspension and mods like these can take away it's drivability.|`|KUS2x5Tiaa	keep it stock

AA10713186	Bluebirds were marketed towards the female segment of the potential buyers.|`|8zVxYkluaa	Mikey, what are you talking about?  Since when did a Firebird have a bigger engine than a Trans Am?    Anyway, the Trans Am was the highest trim level Firebird(depending on the generation).  "Typically" they had a ground effects package of some sort and a bigger motor.    For instance in the 4thgen(93-02) they had different bumpers, rocker panels and in some cases hood, a LT1 or LS1 engine compared to the 3.4 or 3.8 V6.  This is just generalization, if you need differences on a specific year post up.  I'm still not sure what years the Firebird got the bigger motor compared to a Trans Am like Mikey claims(someone is talking out of their *** lol)    A Formula isn't a the same as a Firebird, hence the motor differences. NO Firebird received a V8 from 93-02, PERIOD.  You could get a V8 Firebird in other generations though(though it still wasn't the highest motor option compared to the Trans Am).|`|v8TWvtQgaa	Mikey.. The trans am came along about 10 years before the smokey and the bandit movie..     A trans am is just a high optioned firebird. Its a model not a make.     Like the camaro, camaro Iroc, camaro Z28,etc.     The trans am norm got high performance suspension, higher HP engine, ram air on some years, body package, interior package, etc     The firebird is the baseline model and the trans am is the highest optioned monel firebird|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Trans Ams were firebirds produced after the Smokey & the Bandit movies.  Also have the bigger motors in them although a firebird would have the biggest available actually.|`|88ca921e0c252f3cf12e19d369f73438aa	It`s basically the name they used for the top of the line.  When it comes to the engine sizes the firebirds did come with the same engines as the ta but i got to watch what i say cause in some years it was  different, 1993 and up the firebird come with a v6, If the firebird had a v8 in it was called a formula.  trans am come with v8 period. As you went up in models they added different upgrades to each model.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	A Trans Am costs more.  It comes standard with all the high-performance stuff on it.    A firebird was not allowed to have the best high-performance stuff, not even optionally.    Formulas fit between there.  Most years, they could be optioned with the best stuff from a Trans Am.  Some years there wasn't much difference at all, because GM cut the available engines down to only 2.  In that case the Formula and Trans Am were mechanically the same.|`|MgTPE5H0aa	the firebird and trans am are different options of the same car the trans am being the better.  firebirds were created in '67 where as T/A's were in '69.basically the T/A is a firebird on steroids, it had more engine options more horses and better suspension also it had rear, front, and side spoilers or "flairs".the T/A also came with a shaker which is a type of air induction.they are both excellent cars but if you want horse power go with the T/A.

Your battery (old or new) has to provide a minimum of 9.6 volts to your computer and fuel injection pump while the engine is cranking over. You can test for a possible fuel problem by spraying "starting fluid" into your air intake.

More than likely, its the cables or bad connection.  Good luck!!|`|4yfKLAQvaa	The battery. If its NOT the proper size, its likely not producing enough CCA (cold cranking amps) hence, it won't start.   It could also be the connector points that attach the battery to the rest of the car. Namely the starter and the alternator. If the terminals are corroded or aren't tight, the battery won't fulfill its obligation to provide power to the starter.  Check your cables that lead from the battery to the starter. If they're old or corroded it might cause failure. Check to see if they're getting a greenish coloration on them. If so, you can either replace them as a whole or if they're long enough, cut them back to where you no longer see green|`|Y139iZEBaa	the gas line cold be frozen
LuqZXXyBaa	All DMV's require proof of insurance before they'll let you register the car. In most states, the dealer will issue temporary registration so you can get the vehicle insured. If you bought the vehicle from a private seller you can go into the DMV and see if they'll issue you temporary tags. They're usually issued for 7 days. But you need insurance before you can get your plates|`|SuZbBnycaa	Calipink is wrong.  The DMV will not ask you for proof of insurance to transfer a title to your name.   You need the old title which you will turn in.  They will give you a new registration with your name on it for your car. The title will be mailed to you, which you keep in a safe place.    The only time the DMV will ask for proof of insurance, is when you are renewing your registration and for some reason, their data bank shows you may not have insurance. always take your proof in with you just in case, when re-newing.     You can also do all this at the AAA Auto Club, which sometimes is a little faster.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Just call the DMV and they'll tell you. It varies from state to state, so that can be a hard question to answer correctly.|`|cd5eb0e9ec80482bed5491827a61e262aa	You need the registration on the car first.  You first have to prove you have the car you are trying to get insurance on.  Because if you didn't need the registration then you would be able to get insurance on any car.  Certain cars require different insurance, such as a two door car.  Two doors require a higher fee in insurance because it is faster, so you're more likely to speed more.  The registration says what kind of car you have and it also allows them to put the information into the system and it will estimate how much your insurance would be.  I don't think you could get car insurance before it is registered.      But to sum this all up, the insurance company can not give the car insurance it is not registered and you also can not legally drive the car without it being registered.  You're tags depends on the registration of the car and if it is not registered and you are driving it, then you could go to jail and I am sure you do not want that.    Go to the DMV, get your car registered first and then get the insurance.  I hope this helped some :-)

8ac02aae482a2068cda3fd06248ac226aa	Horsepower is a useless measure when you aren't taking weight into account.  So it depends on both measurements.  For example, a car that has 180 bhp but weighs less than a ton could accelerate faster than a car with 450 bhp that weighs 2 tons.  You also need to take into account the amount of torque the car/bike has.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Is the "H" key broken on your keyboard?

3ME7sBxjaa	It sounds like they just called it an infraction.  You would be notified if it were a misdemeanor or a felony.  In some states exceeding 100 mph is a felony.  Apparently not in CA.    Also on the ticket there might be a check box for infraction | misdemeanor | felony.  I got a ticket recently in San Diego and there was a spot for that.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	Driving in excess of 100 mph can definitely be charged as reckless driving.  If your ticket just says "speeding" then you got off lucky.  However, 100 mph tickets usually have a mandatory court date, meaning you will either have to go to court in person, or hire an attorney to represent you in court.  100 mph + usually results in a suspended license and a fine for CA licensed drivers, not sure how it will effect your NV license.|`|cd5eb0e9ec80482bed5491827a61e262aa	It truly does vary from state to state.  I know where I live you are confiscated from your car and searched because the cops would really think you were doing something illegal.  I don't know how legal it is but I have friends that just loves to speed and they eventually got their license suspended for reckless endangerment.      California law seems different, but the ticket seemed very high so maybe they didn't charge you with anything and gave you a very high ticket for the speeding. But I think you were charged with reckless endangerment.  That could be why the ticket is so expensive.    They might have also added points to your drivers license without you knowing.  I don't know how that works because I have never had points on my license, but I think you would be notified if points were placed on your license.    I hope this helps some :-)|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Most states if you're going more than 20-mph over the speed limit it becomes "reckless driving." In some circumstances they can charge you with reckless endangerment and can actually take you to jail. Of course this is where officer's discretion comes into play. You're probably dealing with a misdemeanor even if it is reckless driving. Anything that has a sentence of a year or less is a misdemeanor.|`|AA12377112	I don't know how it works since you're from out of state, but you are supposed to lose your license in CA for anything over 100 for at least 30 days.

f787da25adf88f5c9415340618993e18aa	On average, a petrol car puts out about 40% more power for the same engine size. This is reduced to about 10% for normally aspirated petrol vs turbo diesel. And about 20% for the most modern injection diesels.    If the diesel has a bigger engine, then this offsets the lower power output.    Throw in the diesels' longer life span and reduced wear and tear, and petrol is a no-brainer in Europe, except that car manufacturers charge a premium for the diesel models.

After all, Hertz is a for profit company who would probably not resist taking your money if they had the chance.

The faceplate is larger on the stock unit to allow easy operation of the controls with gloves on.    Before you do what you are about to do, though, know that the car came with one heck of a system from the factory.  It is going to be hard to beat, without spending loads of cash.    If your vehicle didn't come with the 1.5 din faceplate, you need nothing else.  If your vehicle has the taller faceplate, you don't NEED anything, but the dealer sells a trim piece that goes under an aftermarket unit that cleans up the look a bit.    There is a lot in that dashboard.  Try and find a receiver that is on the shallow side.

You'll get better fuel mileage with the car (not that important when gas is $1.90/gal but pretty significant if or when it goes back up to $4.00/gal) and the items you list aren't THAT big or heavy.

wqeAeSVYaa	Yes, based on the vehicle code, you were driving at an unsafe speed for conditions.  You recognized a problem in the road, and failed to slow to a speed where you could exit the lane and maneuver around the debris.  As you were the only car involved, you were the only one who could have avoided this object.    The only way that you could be found not at fault for this, is if the ladder had just fallen off another vehicle and was bouncing around in the lane before you struck it.    The only other way that you could get out of this is if the ladder had some sort of identification on it, and you could show that it had fallen out of someone's vehicle.  It is doubtful that the police will follow up on this.    If you only have $1300 in damages, and $1000 as a deductible, you are better off repairing this out of your own pocket and closing your claim.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	Yes, you are at fault. You collided with something in the road, that's a negligent collision accident. You're supposed to remain in complete control of your vehicle at all times which you failed to do. I wouldn't file a claim. The insurance company will only pay out $300 but that will result in higher premiums for 3 years. As long as you weren't cited for anything by the highway patrol then they will not release the information to your insurance company.|`|C0yagFFoaa	if you dint damage your car much, just dont claim on it, fix it your self and save the money.  but you mus thave otld them already,   the highway authirity will say you werent looking where you were going.|`|DV4xyeChaa	don't claim..it will raise insurance premium for years...cops dont report it [or care] lol|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Yes you are at fault for the accident. No you shouldn't claim it because the increased premiums you'll be paying for the next 5 years will easily negate the $300 you're going to receive. Do not bother with a police report as this is a single vehicle accident. You can sue the highway department however unless you can prove that they knew about the obstruction in the road and didn't do anything about it in a reasonable amount of time, which is going to be near impossible, you are not going to succeed.

WwXrTQgaaa	sounds like an idiot to me. i wouldn't worry about it. you didn't throw it at him and he has no proof otherwise.    most bus drivers are a bit nutty anyway. you know that i'm sure.
NzIoJlNUaa	That depends on the rms wattage of the subs and amps,they may be a good match.  But not knowing what brand and model of each is it's hard to say.    For example rockford fosgate makes 12'' subs that will only handle 150 watts rms.  So if you have two of them and the amp is 300 watts rms that would be a good match.|`|dRozk0cCaa	if you mean 300 rms is depends on the sub if the sub are 150 rms each than it would be good if its more than you would need a more bigger amp|`|Hqan62xzaa	No, I have a 400 watt for my single 10". You will need at least 800 for good sound or bass output.|`|0xM4I7dqaa	no you will need a bigger amp to power those two twelves i had a 300 watt amp running to a kicker cvr 10 and it barely powered it|`|PhpzZIQfaa	1 12"requires at least 400 rms each i could tell you more if i had more information on the subwoofers. mainly match up the rms rating of the subwoofers|`|PWuWfc7vaa	lol.. No u need a way better amp, depending on wat subs u lookin at i woudl go with teh dimond audio for 2 subs if u want a good sound|`|UJe2PY4Caa	i would go with a 1000 watt just to be safe and it will hit pretty hard
hMkb7H31aa	You fail the written (multiple choice) test - Rules of the Road    Behind the wheel - you:  Speed, use one hand on steering wheel, do not signal turns, cannot parallel park, follow too close, cannot merge correctly onto highway, change lanes improperly, do not give others right of way when it is requried, do not drive in reverse correctly, do not use side view and/or rear view mirror correcrtly - or at all, do not know hand signals, do not know basics of the car you are being tested in (locations of lights. brake, gas, emergency brake or horn).....  and >>>>>YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE EXAMINER DURING THE BEHIND THE WHEEL TEST.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	Main reason.... you can't drive
wqeAeSVYaa	I know, just drive it down and fly back up to Norcal on Virgin, Jetblue or Southwest for hecka cheap, right?|`|U9bQgfY9aa	You can. Just fly up there and drive it back.|`|mTwn8p79aa	You, with a truck and a trailer from uhaul and a long day of driving.  Or you and a buddy without any equipment.    Or Allied for a small fortune.|`|qhyn0vmEaa	Why Don't you just drive it?|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Check a place called U-Ship. http://www.uship.com It is a board where people post ads looking for things to move or have moved. You can also google auto shipping companies if you want to go with a "Pro". I expect there is a reason you want to ship it so I won't make a ridiculous remark like "why don't you drive it". That isn't an answer. I guess some people don't understand the need to ship a vehicle rather than driving it. To the people here who keep saying "drive it"...get a clue. He asked about shipping for a reason and not for you to be stupid.
FMzRsb4faa	As you now that those vehicles have a safety device, so when you step on the brake pedal you will here a click sound and that means you can shift it out of park. NOW if you dont hear the clicking sound then it means that your fuse blew for that puspose only. I have had that happen to me a couple of times so just look for the blown fuse, replace it and away you go.|`|OtYAkRrRaa	Just in case that didn't work check to see if your emergency brake is on.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	Sometimes if you stop on a slight grade and shift to Park and release the foot brake prior to engaging the Park brake the vehicle rolls and puts the parking pin in a bind. In that case the car needs a little nudge back up grade to get the pressure off the pin.
