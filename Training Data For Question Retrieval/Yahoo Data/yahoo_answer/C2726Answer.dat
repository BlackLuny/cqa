pj63ZODzaa	we always used to use tin foil and wire clothing hangers like you get from the dry cleaners.  you just lay some loose foil over the area you don't want the cat jumping on and put some hangers around too.  for some reason they are not fond of landing on these materials.  maybe the sound or something.  also if any of the furniture you don't want the cat on or especially scratching, super-mega pet supply stores sell a spray that you spray on the furniture (obviously safe for the fabric) that will detour them.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	don't worry your kitten will grow out of it my cat use to do that.

tShDXmgbaa	You fish has "clamped fins" which is a sign of stress and/or disease and not all fish in a tank will go thru it at the same time.  First try doing some water changes and then get some meds. to treat the whole tank to stop it from spreading.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	How long have you had the fish, and what is the male to female ratio for these guppies. It sounds like water quality issues, but you state that all levels are fine. If this is true it could be just age related, or if there are less than 2-3 females for every male and this is a female, then she could be getting picked on. Another thought may be to re-test the water with a different test kit. Sometimes the test kits get old and do not work properly.
1omgPICKaa	You have a very gorgeous lutino cockatiel! :D<br>  <br>  My cockatiels love dandelion leaves the most (which are actually very nutritous). Also apple and broccoli, among others. Try mixing it in with her main food and/or cutting it in different sizes and different ways to make a different texture (including grating).<br>  Pretend to eat the veges yourself and look like you're enjoying it.

The oldest tiel I have had was Peter who died at the age of 18 years.<br>  <br>  Don't give your bird apple or pit type seeds. They contain small amounts of cyanide . An apple seed or two might not make any difference but the larger pits like peach might. <br>  <br>  Most birds like baked sweet potatoes. just zap in the microwave until soft--usually 4 to 6 minutes. My birds like frozen peas and corn. Thaw for a few minutes in warm water.Canned pineapple in it's own juice is also a big hit.|`|R8BFzkzPaa	It was aaages ago when I last had a pet cockatiel. We had three, the oldest was probably over 10 years old (we adopted him, his name was Radcliffe). They unfortunately all died within a few nights of each other. I'm not sure what they died of. It may have been the seed, an illness, or the cold. Anyways, what's her name? She look gorgeous!! Her cage is large enough and it looks like you've got plenty of fun toys for her. I've heard of ddandelionsmaking good treats. The whole thing; flower, stem and leaves. Not sure about the roots. I had a yellow indian ringneck who was extremely fussy. It was so impossible to get her to eat anything but seed and a few different types of fruit and veges. However, she did like wwatermelon those little three-bean things (with the sprouts and mung beans and stuff), corn, apple cores and large seeds from things like nnectarines Some birds like millet spray every now and then but she hated the stuff. Don't feed her too many seeds, sunflower seeds in particular. AAvocadoand lettuce are big no-no's. They'll giver her ddiarrhea Yuck!<br>  <br>  Best of luck with her :)
jAQsHjZQaa	Around 3-4 weeks along she can go to the vet to get a pregnancy test. Around 5 weeks is when it becomes evident in little dogs as they become bigger and lazier. For larger dogs sometimes you can't tell till they're in their last two weeks of pregnancy! Of course if your dog went into heat and didn't get bred then she may show all these sign when she isn't pregnant. It's called "false pregnancy." You can watch for her getting  bigger, getting tired more easily and lying around more, eating and drinking more, and possibly a temperament change. If you find that she is pregnant then BE PREPARED!!!! Especially if your dog is small there may be birth complications. You need to be there as she whelps and know what to expect so you can call the vet if necessary. To find out what to expect you can go to this website: <a href="http://www.hilltopanimalhospital.com/reproduction.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hilltopanimalhospital.com/rep...</a> and click on a link.

If you take her to the vet's at around 5 weeks, they can do a scan to see if she is in whelp. Otherwise, the symptoms after around 3 wks are losing hair around the nipples, slight thickening at the end of the ribs, maybe a change in behaviour - all of which can also be signs of a phantom pregnancy.|`|0d78403582fb776161f7bfecfda2df86aa	Actually yes you can do a pregnancy test on it as the hormones would be the same.

20ed098dad318734caa28fd9906d93deaa	I really need to comment on what another person answered. It was suggested that you take her to the dog park to socialize her with other dogs and people.  While this is a great thing to do please keep in mind that a dog's immune system is not fully developed until they are about 4 months old.  At 8 weeks she is susceptible to all manner of diseases including parvo, distemper, coccidia and giardia (which humans can also catch).  I would be very careful with her until she is 4 mths old and fully vaccinated.<br>  <br>  Dogs are easily spoiled BTW.  I wouldn't ignore her when she cries, but you might want to get up and encourage her to follow you on a walk across the room instead.  If she stops crying during the walk then pick her up.  That way you're teaching her that you will love on her, just not when she's whining for it. <br>  <br>  I can't see any reason that you wouldn't be able to let her sit in your lap or lay next to you while you're playing video games or talking on the phone or whatever.  Perhaps you could just prevent her crying by doing that in the first place.  She should eventually be content just being in your presence and not want to be held all the time.  In the meantime just be glad that someone loves you that much and wants to spend as much time as possible with you.<br>  <br>  She is not too young to start working on basic obedience training. The biggest mistake that I have seen people make with small dogs is a lack of training and discipline. These are very important in making sure that she is a positive addition to the family and does not become a nuisance. What's cute in a puppy may not be cute at all in an adult dog.  Training and discipline will be especially important as you begin to introduce new people and situations into her life such as: husband, children, moving to a new location, etc.   I think that the best command you can teach your dog is "Sit".  If she knows how to sit you can stop her if she gets out-of-control hyper, if she slips out of the house off leash, and if she is near a road "sit" could even save her life.  I would start gently working on that. Once she has learned to sit on command in a quiet environment start introducing noise and movement into the training sessions so that she will learn to not be distracted from your commands in "real world" situations.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'm not being ugly or judgemental so please don't take it that way, but you are young and therefore unsettled in life, so I would like to ask you to remember that a dog is not a disposable item.  She is a living creature and you have taken on the responsibility of caring for her for the rest of her life.  If you feel that you will be unable to fulfill your obligations to her then consider rehoming her ASAP with someone who can and will.  If, however, you feel that you are up to the task, enjoy it!  Our little furbabies really can be our best friends.|`|l2T4TrN6aa	You may have to set your video games and social life aside while she is a puppy. Puppies need alot of attention. <br>  <br>  You can expect more time to yourself once she's an adult. She'll still need attention, just not as much.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  First of all, I must say that you probably shouldn't have got a puppy at such a young age until the school holidays where you could spend more time with her and build up her time alone.<br>  <br>  This pup may start to chew the house apart if left alone for too long (is the dog home alone or are your folks there).<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, try to spend as much time with the pup as possible and make sure she gets walks.  She needs plenty of chew toys too and take her out at the weekends.<br>  <br>  This is a smaller breed of dog and so you could probably take it to more places than you think.<br>  <br>  A pup should only be alone for an hour or two here and there until it is older really.|`|xKl3cKB8aa	Puppies usually cry when they are left alone. It's a way to get attention from it's owners. If you cannot change your plans, you should change her life and make it more interested. But her a lot of chew toys. Stuff treats in some of them. She might take the whole day to try getting it out. But that will keep her occupied for only several hours. I suggest to buy another puppy to keep her company and play with her. But i don't think you want to do that. So, i think you should get lost of toys and ask someone like your neighbour to keep her company. Like, bring her to your neighbours house until you get back. Good luck.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	well yes, you sort of are neglecting her. Puppies are a lot like human babies and need attention and care almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I am sorry that you got such a young pup while you are still in school. It is always better to get them when you are out for summer as you can devote more time to them while they are extremely young. She is crying because she is a baby and has been taken from her mom and siblings. She is scared and lonely. Isn't there someone that could puppysit until you get home? She needs someone to watch her, care for her, take her to potty, play with her, cuddle her, and make sure she is not getting in to anything dangerous (like poisons or chewing on cords).|`|O0jUUkTCaa	isnt there anyone else living with you that could also take care of the puppy? You should understand having a puppy means commitment and yes, your social life may get affected. Puppies need as much attention as they can get so to avoid anxiety when in contact with other humans (eg. people patting him on the street) and proper socialising results in a well trained and experienced dog. Leaving him alone isnt the huge issue, but leaving him alone all the time is. He's grown to know how to demand your attention and you give it to him everytime he cries. Next time don't fall for his pleas and he will learn he cant get what he wants by crying all the time. You will need to take her out to the park and socialise her with other dogs, especially since she is in her puppy stage it is crucial you get things right or she could grow up to be an aggressive and unfriendly dog.<br>  good luck

n4pNNcGfaa	Breed is irrelevant in a dog's ability to do service work.  Certain breeds are more easily recognized as being service dogs and might make the public's perception of you a bit easier:  Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever.  While other breeds can certainly be used, the odds are you will face fewer issues about the legitimacy of a service dog if it is of a traditional breed.  You are most likely to get grief with a toy breed because people think you are just trying to pass off a pet as a service dog so you can do a "Paris Hilton" and use the dog as a fashion accessory.<br>  <br>  Think carefully about the ramifications of getting a service dog. It will mean an increase in unwanted attention from strangers.  People will strike up conversations because they are curious about the dog.  They will ask invasive and personal questions about what your disability is.  They will attempt to pet and otherwise interact with your dog.  And some will be upset about the presence of your dog and may even yell or threaten.  Ask yourself whether the benefits of having a dog would outweigh these negatives.  It's an individual choice.  For some people it is worth it, but for others it is not.<br>  <br>  To qualify, you must be disabled.  One in four people in the U.S. has some form of mental illness.  But only 6% are disabled by that illness.  Under the ADA, "Disability means, with respect to an individual, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual...."  <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html#Anchor-36104" rel="nofollow">http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html#Anchor-361...</a><br>  <br>  For your dog to qualify as a service dog, it must be a, "guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to, guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals with impaired hearing to intruders or sounds, providing minimal protection or rescue work, pulling awheelchair[sic], or fetching dropped items."  <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html#Anchor-36104" rel="nofollow">http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html#Anchor-361...</a><br>  <br>  The U.S. Department of Justice, which wrote the above definitions and which administers the ADA, has said, "Animals whose sole function is to provide emotional support, comfort, therapy, companionship, therapeutic benefits, or to promote emotional well-being are not service animals."  So it is not enough that you feel better with a dog with you.  The dog must be trained to do something you cannot do because of your disability that helps you to over come one or more limitations of your disability.  <a href="http://www.ada.gov/NPRM2008/t3NPRM_federalreg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ada.gov/NPRM2008/t3NPRM_feder...</a><br>  <br>  For more information on psychiatric service dogs, visit:  <a href="http://servicedogcentral.org/content/node/74" rel="nofollow">http://servicedogcentral.org/content/nod...</a><br>  <br>  To look for a program that trains service dogs, visit:<br>  <a href="http://servicedogcentral.org/content/node/262" rel="nofollow">http://servicedogcentral.org/content/nod...</a>|`|AA10200409	I don't know about the requirements but I can tell you that a golden retriever will be your best support dog.|`|3z0NLTGYaa	There is currently a thread on the service/therapy dog section of Dogster that lists several organizations that train PSDs.<br>  <br>  I can tell you what breeds are NOT cut out for this type of work.  GSDs, Malinois, and any of the "protection" type breeds really shouldn't be used.  Most of them tend to want to take control in what can be inappropriate ways if their handler disassociates or is otherwise overwhelmed.  Depending on your situation and what tasks you need assistance with, a smaller dog might be a better option for you.<br>  <br>  The key is that the dog must be task trained to assist you with things that you cannot do for yourself.  Medication reminders can be accomplished through other means (watches, multiple alarm clocks, ect).  You also need to keep in mind that simply being there is NOT considered a task.|`|7Tyv6zG7aa	Any animal can help you with emotional problems, so what kind of breed you are looking for I couldn't tell ya.Have you asked your therapist what kind of breed of dog they suggest, since they brought it up? Or try asking a vet. Just make sure YOU can handle taking care of an animal and that you're both compatible with one another. You could even try a puppy of any breed, and try to train it yourself. The bond (which is very important) between owner and pet is stronger when you can raise them from a young age. Well, I found it to be the case with my animals.

It's a bit of a pain, but it is possible.  It means that you will have to have set meal times in stead of free-feeding, and that you will have to sit there between the cats to make sure each one eats out of his own dish and does not poach the other's.  I know it is possible because I had to do it.  One of my cats had to have prescription food for his urinary tract issues, and it was too spendy to buy that for both him and the cat who was not sick. So I sat there between them to keep them eating what they were supposed to have.<br>  <br>  Second, carefully consider the quality of the food you are feeding your cats.  If the food you are feeding them is a dry food, or is a canned food that has grain (refined or otherwise) or other starchy ingredients, Nova may be getting more carbs than his system can handle.  Bear in mind that the body needs to produce insulin to process carbs, but in the presence of insulin, fat cells store fat.  Also, fat cells cannot release fat to be used as fuel in other parts of the body except in the absence of insulin.  So the thing to do is learn to read the ingredients labels of your cats food. Here is what I look for when I am shopping (and yes, I do stand around reading labels whenever I try a new variety):  I look for foods that have specific muscle meats as the first few ingredients, and I avoid foods that list "meal" - chicken meal or whatever , and avoid those that have refined grains such as corn or wheat.  Here is a website that goes  into more detail about how to read and understand a cat food label: <a href="http://alter-idem.smartmonkey.org/cats/" rel="nofollow">http://alter-idem.smartmonkey.org/cats/</a> it also has some reviews of different brands of cat foods.  <br>  <br>  I feed my cats mostly Innova, Wellness, Natural Balance, and Felidae.  They may seem more spendy than Purina, or Fancy Feast, but one advantage of feeding the higher quality foods is that there are fewer fillers (carbs) so they are more nutritionally dense, and more satisfying, so the cat ends up eating smaller portions, which stretches your cat food dollar.  If Nova is satisfied with eating less, he will start to shed some of that extra, without a lot of fuss and bother on your part.  Also, some premium pet food brands offer incentives and coupons if you check out there websites - I know Wellness will send you a $5 coupon every month if you call their customer service number.  Another factor that offsets the greater expense is that, just like with humans, the better food they eat, the healthier a life they have - so you end up spending less at the veterinarian's office.  <br>  <br>  A lot of times, I have noticed that cats really like the lower quality foods, like kids like junk food. So it may take some time and patience on your part, to get them to adjust.  But it will be worth the effort.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Try feeding them both one of the grain-free, all meat cat foods like Innova EVO or Wellness Core.  Think - Atkins diet for cats.  Many cats over eat because of what you are feeding them.  Nature made them to be obligate carnivores - their bodies crave protein, and if you're feeding them the typical grocery store food, they need to eat more of it to get the protein they need.  Feeding a high-protein, grain free food will actually satisfy these cats with less food, and you'll see a gradual weight loss.|`|4UQegWk0aa	Aw, he's a cutie! I see what you mean - you can't stop him eating Jd's food, so just live and let live. It's not the healthiest thing in the world, but when your cat protests by digging out bin scraps when you refuse him food, you hands are kinda tied.<br>  <br>  Instead of going down the food route, try to play with him lots - lots of running around games like chasing string and playing with balls with bells on them. The chances are though, he will just ignore you completely - he looks a bit lazy too.<br>  <br>  Do all you can, but dont hold anything against yourself. In this situation, there is only so much you can do and you shouldn't feel like a bad cat owner.|`|cb7YfH5caa	actually a while back i had my own little fat cat and he was FAT so i saw a cartoon where they took a hotdog and tied it to a pole and i thought what the     He LL   so i tried it every day (at feeding time) for 10 minutes and kinnda dangled it just out of reach i stated seeing results and your cats look very health to me and cute ^-^|`|f3399027b56ee13ae52644ed29eca245aa	A lack of exercise, perhaps.

What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean?

Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_Just_Fine_on_Dry_Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_...</a><br>  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.   <br>   THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL<br>  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters<br>   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods.

eyZhiXYpaa	Firstly, report the person you got him from to the RSPCA or the equivalent depending on where you live.<br>  <br>  No pup should be separated from the mother until at least 8 weeks.  They wean in this time and must have certain vitamins from the mothers milk.  Without these, the dog may suffer from all sorts of diseases.<br>  <br>  Reading this nearly makes me cry to think of the poor pup in the hands of someone who hasn't got a clue about what they are doing, namely YOU.<br>  <br>  I have poodles, a toy and a miniature and so this is extra upsetting for me.<br>  <br>  Find out what the last owner was feeding it, you must keep it on the same diet (NO MILK), buy puppy food if you cannot find out what food the breeder was feeding it.<br>  <br>  Take it to the vet, it must have it's injections and be checked over.  This dog does not sound like it is in the best of health already if it can't take any solids down.<br>  <br>  PLEASE GO TO THE VET AND GET AS MUCH ADVICE AS POSSIBLE.<br>  <br>  It is important that the vet see it as they may give it extra supplements that it will have missed out on from it's mum.<br>  <br>  I pray for this dog, I really do.|`|AA10200409	Take your pup to the vet to be safe and to be sure he doesn't have any illness.|`|AA11537580	are you giving him too much?<br>  if he eats to much he will throw up<br>  the right amount for the type of dog should be on the back of the puppy food bag<br>  maybe you should switch to soft can food.<br>  if all else fails go see the vet he may have allergies<br>  by the way dogs are lactose intolerant (they can only take their mothers milk not tolerating cow milk)so you should not be giving him milk, your making him sick, just give water.<br>  also you should have waited til he was 8 weeks old to be taken from his mother.|`|20ed098dad318734caa28fd9906d93deaa	I'm going to assume that this pup's mom died and his guardians bottled raised him. This baby needs to see a vet ASAP.  He should receive a vaccination at 6 wks.  See if his previous guardians took care of that and while you have them on the phone ask what the dog was eating, how often he ate, if he exhibited the same symptoms that you are seeing.  <br>  <br>  You can buy puppy replacer milk in powder or liquid form from your vet, pet supply store, feed and seed store, or WalMart.  Don't give him cow's milk.  If he's not used to solid food you can soak a little kibble in the replacer milk until it is total mush (just enough to thicken the milk a little) to start getting his little tummy used to something other than milk.  You can add a little more kibble with each meal as long as he held down the previous meal.  <br>  <br>  Don't do this INSTEAD of taking him to a vet. If you can't get him to a vet, take him to the shelter.  They'll either fix him up and find him a home or they'll euthanize him (which is preferable to starving to death in my opinion).<br>  <br>  I mean no offense to you but I agree with those who said that the little guy needs to be in the hands of someone who knows how to handle this type of situation.  I'm in North MS.  If you're within a 5 or 6 hr drive of me I can take him.|`|xKl3cKB8aa	I think he might be in stress. Since he drinks milk, pour some warm milk on his food and everyday, pour lesser and lesser until there is eventually no more. <br>  <br>  Another way is you can leave the food on the floor and walk out. Maybe he will feel more comfortable and will eat. Try to show him that you are fun to be with. Good luck.|`|EENiBG0Saa	first dont feed it milk, its not good for them buy puppy milk formula|`|iVQ1THXaaa	the place where you got him should be able to tell you what food they were feeding them- puppies can't just *switch* food overnight.  you might be feeding him something different that he isn't used to- which can cause the throwing up.  You have to make the change over the course of a week slowly phasing out the old dog food.  If you don't know, I would use the warm milk and food combination, but I would also call the vet to make sure the dog is not sick from something else (like a worm or parasite).  I have two puppies and I feed them The Goodlife Recipe- it's seems to be better than most other puppy/dog foods.|`|mL3LQa3Haa	whatever you do don't feed them cows milk alot of puppies cannot digest the proteins and are lactose intolerant. try a wet meat puppy food like pedigree chum or puppy science plan if available. check the can for the amounts to feed and moisten it down even more with warm water or puppy formula milk. we found that lactol is best if available. this is what we did when weaning our puppies onto solids and as your pup is already eating solid this is best. i would advise not to feed just milk formula as the mother dog would have already began to wean her of if she was still with her. hope this helps and good luck. p.s if this doesn't work and i would only wait about a 5-7 days take her to the vets there may be something else wrong.|`|5fb40d4cb795b5580a8bbb7dfcb37132aa	if any thing give him weetabix or something made up with baby formula milk as cows milk will defo make them ill|`|ux4rkJKdaa	For now the milk is enough...Or try wet dog food.

My puppy died of parvo like two years back. The puppy lived outdoors. I have another puppy now. I did't clean the house with bleach but I live in a four season country(Pakistan). In late 40s and even 50 Celsius during summer and upto -2C during the winter... The puppy is fine,when I got him he was not vaccinated for parvo(three months old). More then three weeks back he got vaccinated:)..<br>  <br>  He lives here my last puppy lived,has the same crate and stuff..<br>  <br>  I would recommend you adopt a puppy who has been vaccinated against parvo.. Upto six weeks of age they are protected with their mother's anti bodies. I would recommend you bring one home after the puppy has got his/her first shots at the earliest.. But you should check with a vet..<br>  <br>  My gf's puppy died of parvo. And her other dog gave birth to a litter a couple of months later. They all are fine and grown up.. She washed her lawn with bleach I think..  Thats where her puppy spent "most" of her sick time (not all I think).<br>  <br>  Alternatively you can adopt a puppy who is a parvo survivor..<br>  <br>  <br>  ps<br>  If parvo virus could live for 50 years in normal conditions we would only have dogs as skeletons in museums like Dinosaurs..|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Your best bet is to get an adult dog that has had it's shots.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I would not bring another pup in for at least a year.  <br>  <br>  As hard as you try, it's not possible to completely eradicate parvo from the environment and it does seem you have really done your best.|`|qeR967J7aa	Sorry to hear about your dog.

The last we brought is a three-month schnauszer pup from Costa Rica--we made certain it had its parvo shots before returning home--then got boosters.<br>  <br>  The vet tells us that she should always be current on those shots.

If you were to get another puppy it would not be safe from parvo until it completed the whole series of boosters.  Your best bet if you want another dog now would be to get an adult dog who has been vaccinated for the disease already as adults are less susceptible (but not totally immune) to parvo then puppies.  If you are set on getting a puppy you should play it safe and wait a year and even then try to keep your new pup out of the part of the yard the old pup was in until he or she has been fully vaccinated.<br>  <br>  Parvo is bad stuff and what happened to your last pup really brings to light the importance of vaccinating your dog.  I'm sorry about your last pup.  Good Luck with your new one.

px27V5N9aa	Are you sure it's rain rot?  Are there hard raised scabs all over?<br>  I've never seen one itchy from rain rot that is why I ask.<br>  <br>  I still say that the Betadine is the best way (Betadine shampoo is always in my bucket to keep bacteria at bay)<br>  You need to soften the scabs (MTG does great!) and pick them off so that the Betadine can get in and kill the bacteria.  Those scabs have to come off.<br>  Don't do it all at once as it's a little irritating, so do a small area every day then dab on the betadine/water mix.  Let sit for 5 minutes then rinse.<br>  <br>  <br>  If there are no pea sized scabs all over and she's just itching herself raw..she has sweet itch or an allergy to something.<br>  You may need the vet to give her a shot of a steroid to help her out til you figure out what is going on.<br>  I had to do that for my gelding until I got the sweet itch under control.<br>  <br>  For the itch you can apply Cortisone creme or Lanacaine to each scab area until you get a vet out.<br>  <br>  I am thinking it is NOT rain rot.

It sounds more like midges and allergy, which is a whole different thing than rain rot. <br>  I think you need your vet to examine her and identify the condition so that the correct treatment can be instituted.  The bacterial infection that causes rain rot is not treated using the same medications and methods as the allergy to midge infestations, and there are several other possible causes besides either of those.<br>  <br>  Your chances of ridding your horse of this without knowing for sure what it actually is are pretty slim.

I am only asking because I was told the same and come to find out it WAS NOT meat it was GRAINS! I almost put one of my dogs down because of this! <br>  <br>  The only really way to find out if your dog can’t have meat is my eliminating it! I stared with chicken, I feed a food with only chicken and no grains as well and that was =one my female can’t have! Then I changed to beef and all was good. So far the only meat they can’t have is Chicken!  <br>  <br>  The other thing you can do is raw! If I had a place out side I would be feeding raw in a heart beat! We are planning on build a place this summer just so we can! <br>  <br>  Also 99% of vets don’t have a clue what food is good! They will tell you there food they get big bucks $$$ for selling is the best!! !<br>  <br>  Here is where I would start! I would start with EVO it is the best food you can get and is the closest to RAW. If you can’t feed raw! I started with the chicken one and then the beef. Both of my dogs did amazing on the red meat one! I have also feed solid gold barking at the moon and right now I am test out taste of the wild pacific stream and so far is been great! <br>  <br>  If I was you I would start doing your own research and see what is out there!

I have no idea how I missed this because I was on almost all day yesterday. <br>  <br>  Why would your vet tell you that?<br>  <br>  Your vet is obviously stupid, and I am not denying the fact dogs can develop an allergy to meat, but generally, that is not the case. And even if the dog is allergic to it in kibble, the protein can still be fed raw. And other proteins can be switched to. <br>  <br>  What foods have you fed?<br>  How did the vet come to this conclusion?<br>  <br>  With food allergies, it is generally the grains causing the issue. Sometimes it can be the meat protein in the food, which if you switch to a different meat base, the dog does fine. And if you feed the supposed allergic meat raw, the dog tolerates it fine. (maybe slight tummy upset if not used to it). <br>  <br>  I would seek a canine nutritionist familiar with raw and allergy issues. <br>  Here is the one I recommend: <a href="http://www.dogfoodguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodguru.com</a><br>  <br>  In the mean time, let me know what foods you have fed your dog up to this point, every food.

6KyyhE0Xaa	Once you start hormone treatments of any kind, you're best to monitor blood levels closely in the initial stages to make sure the drugs are reaching the right level in the blood, and that they aren't too high or too low.<br>  <br>  Many vets, myself included, prefer taking blood from a cats or dogs neck - the vein is bigger there, and it is easier and safer for the person trying to restrain the animal for me to take the blood sample.<br>  <br>  Most vets now have in-house blood testing.  The system we use has different 'panels' for different tests - for example, a pre-anaesthetic blood panel assesses kidney and liver function.  A T4 panel checks the levels of thyroid hormone.  So for us, we would draw off enough blood for the two tests, but the tests have to be run separately because they are on different panels.<br>  <br>  You are wise to check kidneys - often hyperthyroidism can mask kidney problems, and if you correct the hyperthyroidism, the kidney failure may then become visible.  Your vet will know this and it will be one of the things he will check for on the repeat visits.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hmjAwZQEaa	it's all usual practice.<br>  My cat had an over active thyroid and lost so much weight. He died eventually but only after a year or so but dont worry he was 15 so the poor guy was no spring chicken|`|vwC7klVVaa	Our cat was diagnosed about 4 months ago with an over active thyroid  too. She had a blood test taken from her neck which is quiet normal . She had to go back after a month but the tablets weren't working so the vet up the dose from 1 twice daily to 1 three times a day. She went back last week and the tablets are working fine now as her heart rate has gone back to normal and she has put on weight. The vet didn't need to do a blood test as she is doing so well. She needs to go back every few months for check up but are vet will only do blood test if she is losing weight or her heart rate is not good or he is concerned. We have an excellent vet who we have been with for years  and i know i can trust.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Usually once a cat is regulated on their thyroid medication (it's sort of a trial and error as different cats respond differently to the drug) they get a repeat thyroid check every 6 months. <br>  <br>  Generally they take blood from the neck - I'm not sure why you would object to that?  It's pretty painless, it's a larger vein, and the process is much quicker.  <br>  <br>  The kidney function is tested with a basic blood panel (can be called metabolic function, CBC, or other things) *and* a urinalysis that tests the concentration of the urine which many specialists now say is a better indication of how well the kidneys are working.  The thyroid is tested with a specific test called a T4 test.  They can both be tested with one blood draw, but they are two separate and specific tests.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Hi<br>   To answer your questions<br>  <br>   As has been said, taking blood from the neck or leg is fine. It probably hurts less from the neck<br>   As far as the tests go the hyperT was diagnosed through  a blood test and usually all the tests are done so you should have what you need for crf. If hyperT was specifically tested for then that would explain why you do not have the other results but that is a weird way to do things<br>   When I get a blood test, I get a full cbc with t-4 levels which tests for everything<br>   I do not know what Your money situation is but if it is ok, it would be better for your cat and cheaper in the long run to have the radio iodine treatment done. It can run about $1500 dollars but is a one time treatment with a very high success rate. It ends up cheaper as you will always have to run to the vets for blood checks if you give the pills.<br>   Best of luck
vlrCvudnaa	This might be exactly that.  Here are some common ways to check and see if your doggies have any kind of dog/man sicknesses of the blood and or skin.<br>  <br>  1. Put your finger in his mouth.  Gently rub the gums towards the back of his mouth, if they are squishy kind of like if you were to put your finger in mashed potatoes then yes he has diabetes.<br>  <br>  2.  When you pull on his fur if he barks at you when it falls out - then its more than likely you are pulling the fur out.  However if he doesn't bark then it might be a skin disease called dermosis, or what is referred to as "Flap Skins" among vets.  This is where the dog's sub-roots of his fur go from his 6th layer of skin to his top 2-3. layers of his skin (which is dead skin for dogs also known as 'Flap Skins' due to the fact that it can be scrapped off at the Vets) and it basically, if stimulated, will fall out where it is stimulated.  <br>  <br>  3.  If you put your hand over his muzzle and he just lets you after totally covering his air supply for a minute or 2 (don't worry dog's can go longer than humans without air) - if there is no fight in the pup.... it might be ol' yeller time (I'm kidding, please take the dog to the vet to have him put down, please do not shoot your dog).<br>  <br>  If you would like more information on dog diabetes the following websites are great sources of info approved by Vets.<br>  <br>  www.ismydoggoingtodie.net <br>  www.gumdiseasesfordogs.org<br>  www.pupillnesses.org<br>  www.whyishejustlyingtherelikethat.net<br>  www.dogissick.org<br>  www.willfordbrimleyheartsdogdiabetes.c...|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	First of all, why does it turn into tugging at his coat?<br>  <br>  Second, it's the time of year when a lot of dogs shed.

gz5O9Tbpaa	Then find a new vet. I had a vet that wanted to give my dog Frontline, even though he's dangeriously allergic to it. I gave it to him once and it almost killed him. So no, I'm not going to give it to him again, no matter how great the vet thinks it is. <br>  <br>  Vets dont know just a whole lot about food. I have had many ask me why I am wasting my money feeding my dog Wellness... and not science diet... since they have a huge stack of it out front. Yes, vets get paid to push a certain food.<br>  <br>  I've had to walk out of a vet's office in the middle of an exam once. The vet picked up my two year old male dog and looked him over, then asked me if he was fixed... if HE was FIXED! Isnt that fairly obvious?? So I told the head vet why I was leaving and not paying for the exam (no meds had been given yet). He agreed with me and let me leave.<br>  <br>  No one says you have to stay with one vet, find someone else.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	If the vet is about the money then sure they are going to recommend it because they do get a kick back from selling it and then if your dog gets sick they get more money because you are going to have to seek help.  I would look for a new vet now before you even have a need for them.  It would be better to have one that is about the animals not the money.  Of course all have to make a living but the overall concern should be for your pets well being.  I wish everyone could find one like mine.  They just treated my pup in the pet hospital for 4 days for parvo, cured him, and gave him his next set of shot and worming all for $100. I hope you find a better one.  Good Luck.  Also I have found all good vets will work with you.  I used to use one before I moved that no matter what would let you post date several checks to pay for care.

And it is EXTREMELY rare that a dog has food allergies so severe that they could kill them.  So your vet is not trying to hurt your dog or being "reckless," they are trying to follow the same protocol that works extremely well for most dogs with chronic pancreatitis.  However, if they are aware that your dog does not tolerate corn I too would wonder why they would keep suggesting a food that has corn in it.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel like you can trust your vet then you need to find a new vet.  That's really the bottom line here.  Even if you are "searching" for a new vet I would not continue to go to this one if you are not comfortable with them.<br>  <br>  Vets that sell food in their practices make money from the food they sell just the same way they make money from any of the medications or services they sell.  They do this the same way any retailer makes a profit on any product, by marking up the price so that they sell it for more money than they bought it for.  They do not "get a kickback" from the food companies to sell their particular products.  Their employees may get special deals on that companies product if the clinic carries the product but that's not the same as the company writing the clinic owner a big bonus check just because they are pushing their product.  I work at a vet clinic and trust me, if the clinic owner was getting any sort of a "kickback" from Hills for selling their products then we would still be carrying their non-prescription diets.  As it is, we were not making a significant enough profit on their regular non-prescription diets (like their adult, light, or puppy formulas for example) so the clinic owner decided to carry ONLY the diets that a client needs a prescription from a veterinarian in order to buy (and even then we only carry the ones that our clients have prescriptions for, we can get all of them but we don't keep all of them on the shelf).  Yes, many vets will recommend a particular food over another because the food companies are the ones sponsoring the nutrition classes in vet school and those are the foods that most vets are most familiar and comfortable with.  But that's not the same thing as "getting a kickback" from the food company.<br>  <br>  Edit: Next time you're in tell the receptionist to put an alert on his file that he is allergic to corn and insist on seeing the alert yourself before walking out the door.|`|p7swtBYzaa	I stopped feeding my dogs Science Diet a couple of years ago because it is corn based, I feed Canidae now.<br>  <br>  However, Hills does make speciality food for dogs with health issues - it is NOT the same as their regular dry kibble and is often exactly what a particularly dog needs to deal with his problems.<br>  <br>  I think you are being somewhat harsh here, your dog has pancreatitis - that has to be dealt with and that is what your vet is trying to do.   If your dog has a problem with the I/D<br>  that you are aware of, make sure there is a note in your dog's file stating that - but the normal procedure is to put a dog with pancreatitis on I/D, it is formulated specifically for that illness.<br>  <br>  The fact that vets get paid to stock Science Diet is really not the issue here - getting your dog on the right food is - and that is what this vet is recommending - a special diet food for a dog with pancreatitis.  That should be the issue you address too instead of being so hostile to your vet, it's just not going to help your dog to harp on the vet's income, it really isn't important to the issue at hand - your dog's illness and inability to eat normal dog food, meat or corn based.<br>  <br>  <br>  You would do well to attempt to communicate clearly with your vet if you cannot change vets right now, but frankly, an antagonistic, untrusting relationship like this is not good for your dog - try to change vets, but keep the problem of the pancreatitis in mind.   Your dog likely cannot eat normal<br>  dog food and does need a special diet.   The Science Diet specialty diets are very good, their regular dry kibbles contain way too much corn for normal dogs who need more meat.   Your dog may not be able to eat normally and will need some I/D, I know it has worked for my dogs when they had bouts of diarrhea and, in one case, pancreatitis - but so does plain boiled rice and white meat, skinless, boneless chicken - you could always cook that up for your dog.|`|hLjz63N5aa	If you have difficulty finding a vet that you can afford look for your nearest rspca or pdsa as they let you pay at a later date|`|S7aYYGq0aa	Did the Vet sleep with your dog's wife?

I don't think this has to do with not knowing anything about nutrition (which I know, all the internet folks know EVERYTHING about nutrition and vets know nothing...*rolls eyes*).  This vet is not listening to you and unfortunately that can happen with doctors for animals AND people.<br>  <br>  That being said...Science Diet is NOT Iams, so the first poster is off base there.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	What does your vet say when you point out the ingredient in the food when they tell you about it? <br>  <br>  If you aren't happy with your current vet, find another. Are you in a rural remote area where there isn't another vet around? If you are in an area when there are other vets around, check out others. Many vets actually do know a lot about nutrition and don't just push Hills/SD. If you have a choice of finding another vet, go ahead and switch and find another.|`|4gjPQFBDaa	Most vets are trained with a certain company that basically tells them that their product is the best and to sell sell sell that product.

If he's still in pain after a few hours or is limping, take him to the vet to get x-rayed. Keep a close eye on him though because some dogs try to shake off the pain and act as if they're not hurt when they are.<br>  <br>  Also, best thing is to act as if "everything will be ok" and that you're are calm and in control. Dogs who are scared look to their pack leader for strength and assurance. If you look scared to him then he will think "oh $hit, i must really be in trouble because even my pack leader is scared."

It is really hard to judge with dogs when there is something really long. They usually don't show it till it is really really bad.  I would say if he continues doing this for any length of time you should take him to the vet to get checked.  For now I would try to confine him to a small area so that he is not to active so if there is something wrong he won't do more damage.  I have had pups fall or trip over their own feet and act like something was broken for a few hours.  After awhile they started acting better.  Hopefully your little guy will do the same.  Good Luck|`|9kTejB0uaa	Shock, injury, you name it.  Perhaps it would be best to see a vet although puppies do 'bounce', so it might just be shock.  Keep him warm in any case, and if you are worried, do check with your vet.
9kTejB0uaa	The obvious answer re location would be well away from any neighbours!!  It's amazing how many times people move next door to a boarding kennel, with the full knowledge that it's there, and then start to complain about noise!!!<br>  <br>  Building and planning consent etc would depend on where you are, and the regulations in operation in that area.   I lived in a Township in Canada where there were only so-many Kennel Licenses available so it was a case of either waiting on an existing Kennel to come on the market, or for somebody to stop boarding, freeing up a License.<br>  <br>  It might be better to look for a Boarding business that is up for sale than to go through all the hassle there undoubtedly is, in whatever country, when it comes to Kennels?<br>  <br>  ps  And it occurs to me that if you buy an existing business, you will buy the 'goodwill' to go with it, rather than having to build up a client base, from scratch?|`|Hwybmzg5aa	really depends what sort of boarding kennel you want and how much money you have and if you have permission fromm your local council.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Location ideally away from normal houses.<br>  ie.

oo2Hqqanaa	Any dog can be aggressive, just as any dog can be friendly and playful. It all very much depends on the owners attitude and willingness to train and socialise the dog.<br>  <br>  In the UK more people are bitten by the so called "friendly" dogs such as Labrador's and Retrievers than are ever attacked by the allegedly more aggressive dogs such as the Doberman or Rottweiler. ANY dog can be dangerous when owned by an inexperienced or indifferent owner who lack understanding of the animal.<br>  <br>  Do your research, learn about canine behaviour and what dogs need and then when you are ready select the dog that best suits your lifestyle.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Great Danes are NOT inherently aggressive. They're usually extremely human friendly. Most dogs usually are (human friendly) - yes, even Dobermans and other similar breeds.<br>  <br>  Genetics can play a role in aggression but more often than not a dog is aggressive due to poor training or lack of socialization. All puppies will bite - it's called teething and playing. It's up to you and an owner to set boundaries and correct any rough play from day one.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is going to be research - pick up some books on Danes and training. Or go google it (search it on the web.) Please remember that just because the dog itself is free, that doesn't mean it won't cost $$. Dogs need supplies, food, vet care, etc. You can expect to pay up to $400 in the first week, about $150/month, and emergency fees can run over $1,000.<br>  <br>  Danes are also well known for health problems and are not a very long lived breed - where the dogs your sister's friend bred health tested for hip/elbow dysplasia?

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Constance,<br>  <br>  From what I can see of the photo, with the blackened inside of the ear, this can be mites. Mites cat cause yeast and bacterial infections so a quick trip to the vet is a great idea. Some cats scratch their ears and are very uncomfortable, while others don't show any signs of discomfort. Some cats will shake their heads a lot also.<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent article with a photo of a cat with earmites.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petshealth.com/dr_library/earmite.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petshealth.com/dr_library/ear...</a><br>  <br>  Your vet will swab the inside of the ear and put the scraping under the microscope where he/she will be able to diagnose if your cat has mites/yeast, or just dirty ears. He/she will then give you medication to treat your cat if necessary.<br>  <br>  Please do not assume this is mites until your vet diagnoses this properly.  Treating a cat for the wrong condition without veterinary diagnosis is dangerous.<br>  <br>  Also sometimes cats with mites will have smelly ears.

eL268hETaa	Visit your local animal shelter or humane society and LET THE PET PICK YOU.  These days shelters are overrun with donation animals because people are losing their homes and cannot care for them.  They are BEGGING for homes.  You'll know what to do when you see them.  They may even let you test the animal with your kids.  You may need permission from your landlord to adopt.  In some areas the humane society helps fund the spaying/neutering. Or you may be lucky enough to adopt a pet already fixed.  One of my friends just adoped a pure bred Afghan hound for $45.00.  One of my other friends got a 10-year old pure bred Arabian horse for free.  Here where I live the humane society just took in 100 starving cows that had not been fed in 18 months.  Some of them died in the trailer on the way to the shelter.  Like I said... unwanted animals are coming out of the woodwork.  It's a marvelous thing you're doing opening your home and your heart.  Let that heart guide you the rest of the way and find a furry friend for life.<br>  <br>  Bright Blessing to you as well From Epona the Goddess of Animals!|`|7WUvPI8maa	I'd say a dog-medium sized. Dogs are able to handle a little rough love and love to just be around people. Rescuing at a shelter is good because it will give a dog a new start at life. Mixes are fine- we've rescued 2 from shelters before and had no problem. Just ask about what breeds its mixed with and its behavior...etc. Since you are home all the time, I know your dog will receive a lot of love and attention. Good luck.|`|LA2nJToYaa	Boston Terrier<br>  <br>  They are very quiet and love to have their tummy rubbed. They are gentle with kids and visitors. They never ever bark unless scared or alerted. They are a little bigger than a pug around 25-35 pounds on average. They are super easy to train and are really little aristocrats in their mannerisms. <br>  <br>  As for a cat...anything will do just get it as a kitten for early socialization. Cats however can be fickle and can scratch children who play too rough.|`|OrvTG44laa	Are your kids gentle with animals?  If not, I recommend a bigger dog, like a mastiff or rottweiler.  Mastiffs are great with younger kids because of their high pain tolerance, docility and gentleness.  If your kids won't hurt the dog by accident, I recommend a beagle.  They are good with kids and are about 15 to 20 pounds.  They're very friendly and loving.
4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	You will need to visit a vet to find out which guinea pigs are pregnant. <br>  <br>  You should be aware that if any of your female pigs are over 6 months old they will need c-sections in order to deliver the young because a female guinea pig's pelvic bones start to fuse at around 6 months. If they haven't born young before this point then they are at risk of having an obstructed labour which will kill them if left unattended. You really should visit the vet.|`|4gjPQFBDaa	Signs of pregnancy include weight gain, the mother may start drinking more water, and you may be able to feel movement of the babies in the later stages.<br>  <br>  Males are capable of breeding at about 4 weeks of age but shouldn't really be allowed to breed until about 5 months.<br>  <br>  See the following link for more information <a href="http://www.diddly-di.fsnet.co.uk/breeding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diddly-di.fsnet.co.uk/breedin...</a>|`|SXnBWIguaa	He could of fathered babies if she was in season. The only way you can really tell is if you either go to a vet, or wait 3-4 weeks when her stomach should be getting bigger and you will be able to feel the babies moving around in her stomach. (Plus if she is then remove the male as he wont intentionaly kill the babies but he will try it on with her the minute she's given birth and could stumble on the babies and then the mum will get ill.

RnydKwARaa	1st thing you need to do is make sure he is 100% stock broken (sheep/cows/pigs/horses etc) <br>  You won't get any permission land to hunt if you have a dog that worries livestock.<br>  <br>  He is too young to be hunting properly BUT he can be out and about with other dogs, learning from them and maybe having a go on a few easy ones.<br>  <br>  What sort of hunting are you wanting to do (ferreting, lamping etc)<br>  <br>  At this age you should be making sure he is well trained, listens to your commands, start teaching him to jump, start small and then make the jumps higher, a working Lurcher isn't going to get very far if he can't clear a 5 bar gate with ease as an adult.<br>  <br>  Do lots of retrieving work with him, start with balls and toys etc and also with a rabbit skin.<br>  <br>  If you start them too young your will end up with a very frustrated dog (because he isn't quick enough to catch) and a frustrated dog can lead to problems later on (barking behind quarry)<br>  <br>  <br>  **I have owned working Lurchers in the past and i currently have a 6 month old Lurcher pup**|`|Dy8Tpggtaa	We have a lurcher, (staffy X whippet). 7months. shes a *****, and we started working her 2weeks ago (shes goes hunting with my daddy). she seems to be fine with this, but she is very very well trained.. bur she seems to enjoy it..|`|d1PLrU2zaa	my lurcher is about 9 months old now.<br>  we haven't worked him and i don't think we plan on doing but I know someone else who has lurchers and they work them.

ZNe6B9TQaa	No, that's not always true.  There really isn't an exact mathematic formula to how many beats to sit before posting.  Telling young students to "sit two" provides them with an exact gage for how long to sit in order to get the correct diagnol without sitting for an eternity (much akin to telling a young student that shavings in their horses tail will make the horse buck..obviously, the horse doesn't even notice).<br>  <br>  That being said, it's important that you sit as long as it takes to get the correct diagnol.  I rather see a student sit four or five beats (neatly and not bouncily, of course) and begin posting on the correct diagnol then see a student begin posting on the wrong diagnol after sitting only one beat and have to correct it.  When doing Equitation on the flat, you better believe it's more impressive to a judge to see a young person/beginner "feel" for the correct diagnol then to just start posting automatically, pick up the wrong diagnol, notice its wrong by having to look down (awful), and then correct it.  Plus, you lost valuable time riding the correct gate in front of the judge.<br>  <br>  I would, of course, encourage you to work on picking up the correct diagnol as quickly as possible (aim for one to three).  Try to never get above four or five, and always be conciencious of the quality of your sitting trot.  <br>  <br>  Lastly,  if at this stage in your riding career you are unable to pick up the correct diagnol from "feeling" for it (no matter how much you practice), then in that scenario I would encourage you to pick it up immediately and correct as needed.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	You sit one beat so its more like sit up sit up sit up sit up. Ridders will sitt 2 beats if they are on the incorect diagnal to change to the correct diagnal, so when you change direction at the trot get in the habbit of sitting twice so you are on the corect diagnal on the opposite side. As a reminder the correct diagnal is when the outside leg is stretched forward. You should be up out of your seat while the outside leg is stretched out.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Not really sure what you are asking.<br>  <br>  Like when going from the walk? It is really personal choice. I just pick it up right away- my trainer says to sit as long as you can. But sitting one beat does not mean you will always be on the correct diagonal. That would depend on which leg your horse started striding out with- rise and fall with the leg on the wall- and that differs from time to time.<br>  <br>  However, when you switch directions, to switch diagonals, you sit one beat. Sitting two simply causes you to keep the same diagonal. Although for many beginners they are told to sit three, because it takes less coordination than only sitting one does. So you might see that as well. Basically, sitting any uneven number will cause you to switch diagonals.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Truly sitting two will not cause any difference in diagonal, people. Think about it! There are two diagonals. One beat causes you to switch diagonals- so, you switch twice and guess what, you are still on the same diagonal!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Sitting for two beats will help change your diagonal and help engage the muscles you need for the sitting trot. When you are not training and you are showing, etc, if you sit (or stand) for two beats you will only be on the correct diagonal 50% of the time and people will be looking at you like you're nuts.<br>  <br>  This is a training method, not how to ride!|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	When I give lessons to dressage riders and they get their posting off. Whether they are posting on the wrong lead leg or they are posting opposite.<br>  <br>  Just Remember this simple phrase as your ride: <br>  <br>  "RISE AND FALL WITH YOUR LEG ON THE WALL"<br>  <br>  Meaning when the horses outside front leg lands your should be falling and when the leg takes off you should be rising. RISE AND FALL WITH THE LEG ON THE WALL.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, you will never get it wrong.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	it one beat to stay on the diagonal (right or left)<br>  you sit two beats if you are changing diagonals.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|FtEkredUaa	When you transit to working trot rising, sit for 2 beats and then start to rise .. if you look over your shoulder to his/her outside leg when you rise it should be forward, if his/her leg is going backwards sit for a further 2 beats and then continue to rise. If you sit for 2beats before you start to rise you should end up on the correct diagonal. When your in rising trot on the right diagonal when its time to pick up the canter your horse should automatically be able to pick up the right leg in to canter. :) x|`|peDwXmQJaa	If your going to do it right then you will sit only one beat of the trot. <br>  <br>  When your posting you should be rising when your horses OUTSIDE leg is moving forward, and sitting when the INSIDE leg in going forward.<br>  <br>  If you show in english hunter or equation then you will lose points, and probably not place.|`|9MysIZwraa	okay, here is something my riding instructor told me about getting on the correct diagonal "rise and fall, with the leg on the wall" (as the leg on the wall goes foward you rise, and the leg on the wall goes back, you go down)  it takes a while to realize what leg is going up (and sometimes hard to identify which leg is 'on the wall') but after a while, you will get it|`|fQxSClHKaa	well,<br>  for me it feels more like one bump to change it,<br>  but my instructor always tells beginners to sit two.<br>  what i can tell you is to sit one, and if your diagonal doesn't change, sit two. see what works for you :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: thanks for the thumbs down, guys.|`|jnReZFB0aa	i am in a lot of comps my coach says to me you should sit 2 because the horse will like it more than one it is called a diagonal trot.

That's a certain type of Malawi fish, and Nyererei?  Come on, that's a Victorian on top of it.  You mean to list species also not breeds, and which one of these species are spawning?  You know you need to isolate holding females.<br>  <br>  No they do not grow all the same size.  Most Mbuna, (you need me to tell you which ones are Mbuna?) range from 4-6 inches, while Haps (NOT A SPECIES but type, short for Haplochromies) can range all the way up to over 12 inches, it depends on which species.  Pundamilla Nyererei is a Victorian btw, about 4 maybe 5 inches.  Why don't you just tell me the whole story about this tank and how you came to get whatever you have.|`|MqoAtxZYaa	I would say that none of them breeds get bigger than three to four inches.
Rw7gi86Naa	If the kitten stays with its Mom long enough, (an absolute minimum of ten weeks and preferably twelve) it should be very simple. Kittens taken from their mothers too soon often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood. They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats. Try to imagine what kind of impact if would have on a person if they were taken from their mother too early, and didn’t have the proper role model to learn from. So, usually when a kitten has been observing their mother using the litter box, they will usually copy her which also helps the other kittens learn. <br>  <br>  After the kitten has left his mother and he comes home with you for the first time, feed him wet food, (which is what‘s best for him especially before he’s a year old). About thirty minutes after he‘s done eating, place him in the box. If putting him in the box doesn‘t prompt him to use it, then stir the litter with your hands while he’s watching. Never restrain him in the box; you should always let the kitten jump out if he wants to. <br>  <br>  Kittens will often have accidents, and the best thing to do is to pick up the feces and put it in the litter box. This will help him understand that the litter box belongs to him and that is where he should go. If you catch him sniffing around or looking like he needs to go, then immediately put him in the box.  Also one of the most important tips to prevent him from going in the same spot is to thoroughly clean it. I added stain and odor removing tips below. Never yell at or scold the kitten for accidents, as you wouldn't scold a potty training toddler for an accident. Punishment does not help a cat‘s behavior. All it does is make your cat fear and resent you. <br>  <br>  Each day about a half an hour after mealtime and playtime, put him in the box as you did the first time. Cats are creatures of habit, so teach them the routine and you should have no problem. <br>  <br>  <br>  … and for accidents, here are some odor removing tips:<br>  Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3vwvLWrHaa	Just put a liter box where it poops|`|u7Dy2qOkaa	You could try showing the cat the litter box. Or you could put the litter box in a room [where you want it] and put them in there for an hour or so. They'll learn the scent of it, and get used to the idea of going in a litter box.<br>  <br>  Also, both cats should use the same one. It'll be a lot more poop to clean up, but it's less expensive. =] Good luck!|`|vhGIwzROaa	Cats are normally good at getting trained but if you get a DIRTY cat, they are murder to train and most never do become fully litter trained, give it time and see how ya go and take it from there, she might be an out door cat and just wants out all the time, get her/both spade ASAP and see if she changes then, Ahhh good luck.|`|YXCDdDKIaa	Kittens are so easy to train.<br>  <br>  Just put him in the litter box and take one of his paws and do digging motion with his paw in the cat litter, they pick it right up :)<br>  <br>  Then wash ur hands of course.|`|a40e219854bbf5502b5581970a4be553aa	I had the same problem with one of our kittens last year. We got 3 kittens several weeks apart, 2 boys & 1 girl. It was the girl we had the most trouble with, It took ages, I was pleading with my Mum to get her trained before she went away for a weeks holiday with her husband & I'd be in sole charge of the kittens, litter tray & keeping my eye on them. She was getting a little bit better but still kept preferring a corner behind an armchair in the room. In the end I decided since this was her prefered place to put another litter tray in that corner. The others don't bother & would rather now go outside to do their business but little Amy, not quite a year old now is still prefering the corner, we just have to make sure it's tucked right into the corner against the wall or else she'd rather do it on the carpet.  I've decided she must be more reserved than the 2 boys and likes her privacy. She also likes to hide under mats as well. One thing we still haven't managed to stop her from doing though is weeing in the washing up bowl much to my Mums anoyance, lol. I've said she probably thinks it's another litter tray. <br>  Good luck with Dexter!|`|fsvQ51K9aa	whenever they go, eg in the corner you must slightly raise your voice then tap them on their back. After that, pick them up and put them in the litter tray.<br>  <br>  By the way i have two eight week old kittens, i got them on saturday 7th March. So it obviously wasn't long ago. Mine did the same thing ( right in the corner by the wires!) I basically did what i wrote above and now they go in the correct place. <br>  <br>  Aww Dexter is a cute name. Mine are both girls - from the same litter. Molly and Mia. <br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|7Tyv6zG7aa	She might be acting out. Cats are weird creatures. Cats normally know this on their own, but every so often you get the weird one of the bunch. She might just be acting out because she is in a new home. Apparently you know that some cats won't get into a dirty box. Even though she shared one at her old home, maybe she wants her own, and litter boxes aren't that expensive. Try one with a top on it, if you don't have one. My youngest cat only uses the one I have with a top. He likes his privacy.

8Ymsx4Oraa	Im actully in the same situation at the moment. I too was thinking a oscar and maybe a plec but then i thought why have one fish, when i can have heaps of colourful ones! Besides oscars do better in way bigger tanks and need heavy filtering systems. So ive decided Angelfish would get kickas# huge in a 100 gal (no joke) and i could fit 10 nicely as well as have room for more schooling fish!! My stocking list so far is:<br>  10 Angels (all different colours)<br>  8 congo tetras<br>  2 bristlnose catfish<br>  8 cory cats....<br>  <br>  Keep in mind im nicely stcoked on that idea but i definately have room for more!!<br>  <br>  So why not Angelfish? There very graceful but still have that grunt to em if you know what i mean.<br>  <br>  If Angels are not doing it for you then you could always go cichlids. Say a dempsey pair (but then were back to only a few fish) or you could go smaller cichlids such as electric yellows and have quite a few. It all gets technical from here and you have to consider compatibilty, water requiremets, not mixing africans and americans etc etc. But its always a idea.<br>  <br>  My last idea (im trying not to write a noval lol ) is a big peacful community. Kinda like the Angel community but 'smaller' fish and lots more of em. Say mollies, platties, guppies, corys, neons blah blah blah... You know all those smaller and active colourful and cheap fish.. Imagine a huge school of neons!!! <br>  <br>  Anyway i could go on all night with ideas but i wont. 100 gal is big enough to play with but its not all that big (cant house two oscars for instance)<br>  <br>  Whatever you do tell us when youve decided!! Fish keeping with bigger tanks just gets a whole lot funner doesnt it?!!<br>  <br>  Feel free to email.<br>  <br>  Best of luck Angel|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	In the grand scheme of things, a 100g isn't that big, especially compared to say the Amazon River where Oscars are naturally found.<br>  <br>  An adult Oscar will dominate that tank entirely. Adding tankmates will be a risk. What filtration is on it? It will have to be fairly high for an Oscar and anything else.<br>  <br>  In that tank look into a larger pleco (remember, its another high waste producer), some big solid and sturdy decor and leave it at that.

He will probably intimidate people just because of his size.  I am sure he will bark and such when something is new and he feels uncertain about it.  But every Great Dane I have known are  just big teddy bears.  Make wonderful pets if you have the room and the means to feed them.  They will eat alot.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Technically can be both. However if you plan on owning a "guard dog" please put the proper time and training into it -- hire an actual TRAINER. Most people wouldn't dare to "break in" any place with a loud or large (or both) dog.<br>  <br>  Most "guard dogs" you see are not actually guard dogs, but under socialized and aggressive dogs that people throw out in their yard to "guard" their turf. These dogs WILL end up biting someone and will eventually be put to sleep.<br>  <br>  Proper guard dogs do not outright attack -- they alert the owner and bluff, but will only bite if the person threatens them or the owner commands them to. Meaning a burglar breaks in and freezes at the sound of barking, the dog will not charge.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	any dog that has a good home and is loved and treated well will protect thier owners and household. with a great dane just the size of him will scare people off and when thieves or strangers come near he should make a fuss and keep them away. i have a big ole husky who is friendly but with his size and the way he looks no one bothers me, of course i also have a border collie and a little poochi and the bc can be very agressive when some one is in our yard she gets the husky going. i keep warning signs posted on my doors just in case some one comes in unannounced and then i am protected.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	BOTH! i have a Great Dane, and she is so sweet.

nlRr07dRaa	depending on how many corals, what type of corals whether leathers sps etc. one 150MH would be fine, but I would probably recomend 2 to give a more balanced lighting effect. sometimes the Halides are a little expensive a good alternative would be to accent the MH with t5 lighting.|`|H06PtiIAaa	it doesnt matter the 10 cm deapth.  unless we are talking about 30-40 feet it doesnt matter.<br>  <br>  You will be fine with a MH unit of 150 watts on that tank.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: but since the tank is so long you might want to run two metal halide units. + a chiller for control the water temperature.
qYPCkscTaa	Bettas are very interactive with their owners. Every single one of my bettas I have owned or now own will swim to the tank when they see me, including one that is in a 55 gal tank. He'll come all the way from the very back and right up to where I'm standing. Sometimes, they do it because their hungry, and other times it's more just to say hi. So, he's either hungry or he just likes you :)|`|0me6vDF3aa	He expects to be fed!   He could be lonely.

hetZz4c1aa	Improper elimination is often a symptom of a medical problem. Usually it's a urinary infection and easily treated, but PAINFUL.

Sounds like you need to clean the box more often and show that kitty some love.  While it could be medical this in my experience is intentional... your clothes smell like you and well you make him mad, he attacks "you" by eliminating on your clothes, the closest thing to you that will stay still for him to do it.  Jealousy and dirty litter box to cure the cat, double washings on warm with added arm and hammer baking soda for the laundry.  My cat got my shoes last month over the litter box, don't you just love them!  <br>  <br>  Generally medical condition are marked by inability to control the bladder so he would have accidents elsewhere or on multiple spots.  The evacuation would also be reduced or changed in the amount, appearance or smell of it.|`|ArBOK95aaa	inappropriate elimination is a huge red flag that something is wrong with the cat, and most of the time it is medical.  Get your kitty into a vet for a full exam mentioning the peeing, and make sure your kitty is in good health.<br>  <br>  Chances are it is an infection and a short round of antibiotics will clear it right up|`|iL1tYfJMaa	there could be a number of things.<br>  <br>  1. Do you clean your litter box regularly?? Cats are very clean and HATE a disgusting litter box. Since they by nature go to the washroom in dirt and then bury it; if he is pissing on your personal items, he could be very pissed off.<br>  <br>  2. He could be sick. Could be jealous as well.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Many times changes in bathroom habits are caused by medical problems. Cats with urinary tract infections or crystals in their urine will pee on a soft surface to help with the pain. Take your kitty to the vet and get him checked out.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	LOL - funny a$$ cat.|`|36UeGmPPaa	okay first.Is his litter box clean? cats don't want to use the bathroom in a dirty litter box.Is your laundry scattered? if it is then put the laundry in a bin and get rubber covers, so your cat can't climb in it.I suggest you call the vet.The cat may be trying to tell you something.I definitely suggest to call the animal hospital where you got your cat neutered.Now.<br>  <br>  He may also be marking his territory on your laundry.That may be his way of saying that he owns you.Saying your one of him.|`|2uOhDMKjaa	Well just keep your laundry out of reach. He is probably marking his territory because he doesn't like your girlfriend, and he is trying to defend you... maybe you should listen to your cat (and ditch the girl) A animals instinct is always right ;)|`|psDSVWpKaa	my cat does it all the time put your laundry up and replace it with the litter box then the cat will go there and see the litter box|`|AuTmKSjVaa	My wife often aires our laundry in public and extracts the urine more times than I care to remember.<br>  Count yourself lucky!|`|WD6uLJxvaa	My cat does that when i leave for a couple days.

It's a territorial thing, especially if you have any other cats (and it also might be because of your girlfriend). However, it may also be because something is wrong with him. I'd take him to the vet. It could be anything from weak bladder control, feeling ill and not wanting to go in the litterbox, or maybe he has diabetes (my friend's cat was pissing everywhere and that's what it turned out to be).<br>  <br>  A simple solution, if you don't want to go that far, is switching cat litter brand, or even the cat's food brand. These simple things will probably have your cat back on track.|`|frHjz9Vgaa	I don't want to scare you, but, my cat started doing this, I would notice a small amount of pee here and there in unusual spots, and eventually would find puddles of pee in my kitchen, right next to my refrigerator. I thought it was my dog, so I caged him up for a couple of days, well the pee was still appearing, so realized it was my cat. I called my vet and they said that it is a sign that they are sick...their behavior will change, it's like their way of telling you something is wrong. I took him to the vet and he had a urinary tract infection. Well let me add I had to go to a different vet because my cat vet was out of town, they told me they only found a few crystals in his urine, well they gave me meds to give him...it continued. He started losing weight and kept running outside? So I just left him outside with food and water....he dissappeared one day and we found him dead under our porch. If you don't catch a urinary tract infection early, the crystals in their urine will cause a blockage and will kill them. So please call your vet and ask for their opinion. I don't want to scare you and make you think there is something seriously wrong...it could even me a behavior problem, maybe his litter box is dirty? Maybe you changed his litter and he doesn't like it? Have you been around other cats and he smells them on your clothes? It could be anything, but you should call your vet and get him checked out, just to be on the safe side. I wish I would have took care of it sooner, and maybe my cat would still be here. Wish you luck!!!|`|HCQI5UARaa	its either that he has having heath problems or ne is marking he is marking his scent on thing like your dirt clothes so take him to a vet to check it out cause it could be a serious issue .

hBiSNoE7aa	Cats never walk quite like dogs on a leash. You pretty much hold onto the end of the leash and sometimes the cat sits there. I hope you are using a harness and not a leash. I recommend a dog harness, most of the cat harnesses out there have figure eight loops that tighten around the neck and they are not good. Does your cat really like treats? Is there one that is her favorite? Have her favorite treat in your hand and walk to the end of the leash and call her to you. Do this again and again and she should walk better on the leash. If she won't even eat she is too scared to try this training and maybe you should spend more time getting her used to being outside. Perhaps try having her carrier or a box or basket outside with you that she can hide in so she feels safe and can peek out and look. She is still kinda small and will probably gain confidence as she gets older. And you'll have to be very patient.<br>  <br>  A great trick is fetch! I suggest using the plastic ring that comes off the top of a gallon of milk just make sure that she does not eat them or play with them by herself. Teaching her to fetch them might be hard. The one way I know how has only been tried on dogs:<br>  1. Get the cat's attention with the milk ring. Flip it around in your hand so it looks exciting to play with. Or tap the cat on the nose with it until she wants to bite it--then move it away.<br>  2. Throw it.<br>  3. As soon as the cat has the milk ring in her mouth, get a treat out and call her. Hopefully she will still have the milk ring in her mouth. Give her the treat and she will drop the milk ring. If she drops the milk ring before bringing it to you, do not give her a treat, and throw the milk ring again. If it still does not work, go to her after throwing it and give her a treat only when she has the milk ring in her mouth, and then gradually move farther away so she has to carry the milk ring to you. Or you can use a ball or other toy.

KeevlZnTaa	1) I love owning rats, they are one of the best pets I have owned. They are small and easy to care for, but are similar in personality to a dog. <br>  <br>  The closest I came to regretting rat ownership was when my older rats started dying. I bought one rat, and then got her a partner. I then got about a rat every month of so, until I had 13. Obviously I enjoyed them very much, but they all aged and got old. I went 2 years without loosing any rats to old age, but of course when the time came, I was losing them every few weeks, since I got them all a few weeks apart. I was attached to them so it was very painful to be losing them so close together. I have to say I regretted having them at that point. <br>  <br>  After the first group of rats went and I was having trouble losing so many, so soon, I started scaling down how many I had at once. I no longer kept 13 at a time, and still only keep a pair now.<br>  <br>  2-I currently have two boys.<br>  <br>  3) I love the personality of both males and females. I have had great rats of each sex, and don't really have a preference. I currently have males b/c I wanted a calmer rat, and boys tend to be calmer than females.<br>  <br>  4)I used to take a lot of my rats with me to pet stores, or to outdoor ice cream places. Not all of my rats were well behaved enough to do this(my current rats are too jumpy). I had one rat that I used to take with me to the ice cream place, and share a little with him(when he was very old, and bad treats were not going to effect him, since he was reaching the end anyway). <br>  <br>  5)I use blankets instead of bedding. I think the blankets are more comfortable, and my youngest is allergic to bedding. <br>  <br>  7)I have a Matins cage from <a href="http://www.martinscages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.martinscages.com/</a> . It has a lot of room, however I really want a ferret nation cage.<br>  <br>  8)I don't miss them that much when I am not in the house. I see them all the time and know that I am not away too long. I ma never away for that long, if I was away for a long time I would miss them.|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	First of all, can people stop saying Males are cuddly or lazy and females are more active? it is completely unture--take a look at all my boys! okay.<br>  <br>  1.I never regret my rats although they irro=itate me when Kusa has gotten out 15 times.  I love owning rats.<br>  <br>  2.I have three males.<br>  <br>  3.I definitely love males more although i don't have females.  As i said, people can't say males are lazy or cuddly.

Not being able to have a houseful of rats is heartbreaking.  They are the best pets--better than cats or dogs, in my opinion.  I never regretted having rats.<br>  2) Since I bred rats, of course I had males and females.  The most I ever had was 3 males and 6 or 7 females at a time.<br>  3) Although rats don't have much odor, males do have more of a musky scent, so if you are very sensitive to smells you may prefer females.  I think the females tend to be more active and more interested in doing things, so if you want to train them, pick girls.  My boys tended to be more cuddly and laid-back, so if you want a lap or shoulder munchkin, pick boys.  But, those are only generalizations.  Honestly, I like them both equally.<br>  5) Back in the day, I used to use pine shavings, but I didn't know about the evils of such.  If I had rats now, I would use either corncob or recycled newspaper type bedding.<br>  6) My crazy rats made me laugh every day.  I remember playing with a litter, they were about 3 weeks old (just weaned) and I had a dozen little rat pups on a glass dining room table.  They were getting sleepy and were all snuggled together, and I took a photo from below of all the little pink rat toes--it was adorable.  Rats have a sense of humor, I swear.  They will jump around, cling upside down in their cages, run across the floor--up your leg--onto your shoulder; anything for attention.  Some of them are just little clowns.<br>  8) I did miss them when I was at work.  The first thing I did was check on each and every rat when I came home.<br>  Now, of course, I miss all my wonderful ratties, all of them have gone 'cross the Rainbow Bridge to ratty heaven.  I can't wait to see them again; I assume that there are no allergies in heaven.<br>  <br>  You will love your rats.  Spend lots of time with them and get to know them, and they will get to know you.  Enjoy and good luck!|`|79ab050dbcc8861f2c6be1d80f755328aa	1 I love having rats, I don't regret it at all!<br>  #2 My three rats are females<br>  #3 I can't tell because I've never had males, but a lot of people like males because they're calmer (females are more curious and love to explore everything)<br>  #4 I feed my fish while my rat is standing on top of the tank looking at the fish<br>  #5 I use Aspen it's wood<br>  #6 My older rat climbs on the window net ( I don't really know how it's called in English) and they nibble my ears<br>  #7 I have a bottom tank with a second floor made as a cage, it's really comfy and has lots of ventilation<br>  #8 I miss my rats when I'm not with them<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://warrensburg.k12.mo.us/animals/ashleyw1/" rel="nofollow">http://warrensburg.k12.mo.us/animals/ash...</a>|`|840nqUePaa	1) I love owning rats, and i NEVER regret it!<br>  2) I have one male and one female.<br>  3) All rats are the same to me, loving and adorable.<br>  4) My rats absolutely love love love to climb, so I bought a bird ladder and they love it.<br>  5) I use pine bedding, and shredded paper towels.<br>  6) They are just themselves and as long as they are happy I am<br>  7) I actually have my ratties in a large plastic dog cage, the cage was originally supposed to be only temporary until i fixed the lid on their old cage, but they seem to really like the space so i kept it.<br>  8) I always miss them!

wfOIYFYqaa	i personally like the fiesta blend for hamsters and gerbils plus i give them a bit of timothy hay at least every other day.  this helps with urinary tract issues and also aids in bedding and odor control.  a bag lasts a  long time.  but i would say the pellets may just be a bit boring.  how would you like to eat ham and cheese everyday for life.  try this website out. it may help.|`|Fet85A7kaa	Go back to normal gerbil food from the pet store. They prefer this. They WILL eat this.  Gerbils stay healthy as long as you exercise them. Dont waste more time and endanger their lives. Get them some normmal food they would like.
Y5FyAekkaa	To get urine samples from dogs requires some clever planning. Here are some ideas that have worked for clients in the past:<br>  <br>  1. Leash walk her outside. When she squats stick a soup ladle or a flat pie pan underneath her.<br>  <br>  2. Confine her to a small area like a bathroom with plastic covering on the floor, keep a sterile syringe on hand to suck up any urine.<br>  <br>  3. Limit her trips outside then take her for a walk where she can smell urine from other pets, try the pie pan trick.<br>  <br>  If all else fails ususally a vet can do a cytocentesis which involves using a needle to syringe it out of her. Not pleasant so try to come up with an alternative.|`|HyqS3KFraa	construct a Pee Pole<br>  <br>  Vets use one too...<br>  <br>  U can use a hanger, or something similar, and at the end attach a small cup-ish thing.  U can use a paper or plastic cup but cut it down a lot so its pretty shallow.  Attach the two, take her on a leash, when she squats, you put that under her.  Vets only need like 5 drops of urine to run a test, so even if you don't get much, take it in and ask for a sample.  If you can't get to the vet right away, call about if they'd want you to refridgerate the sample or not until you can get in there.|`|pvm8wo9Waa	1) If you must have a full urine sample, consider boarding her at the vet for a day or so and let them get one. <br>  <br>  2) Otherwise, get some urinary test strips, rubberband one onto a pole and hold it in the stream to test for urinary acidity.  Works for me!|`|cETQuE9waa	I would try following her around and then once she starts to pee put the cup under her. I really don't have any other suggestions.

Start saving.  If you aren't able to give your pet adequate care, it may be kinder to surrender him to the SPCA and hope he can find someone who can afford to care for him.

As an owner, you have a responsibility to provide for your pet when it is ill, injured or in pain. "I cannot afford it" is quite simply not an excuse, even in today's economic crisis. Ever heard of pet insurance? Saving up for an emergency? Even if you have lost your job I lack sympathy because you should have made provisions for such situations. If you have access to the Internet, you can afford vet treatment; just give up your Internet. Or is your dog not that important to you?<br>  <br>  I suggest you either ask someone generous for a loan or call up one of your local shelters and see if they can help you out. I also know that some vets do payment plans so I would contact various ones in your area to see.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Are you sure they need the tooth pulled?  Is their pain?  Problem eating?  Infection?<br>  <br>  Canine teeth discolor and wear down as they age... visible teeth decay is common.

zuYpulgKaa	Clipping a gliders nails is important so that they do not get snagged up on their sleep pouches and injure themselves.<br>  <br>  The easiest way I have found to clip nails is to do this during the day with them in their sleep pouch.  Hold the pouch either on your lap or on a table.  Give them a little treat to snack on and then gently but firmly pull out one leg at a time using the pouch to basically wrap the glider with holding the glider's body with the palm of your hand over the top of them and hold their foot (basically at their wrist) with your thumb and index finger and clipping their nails with the other hand.  The pouch helps keep the glider calm and also offers a buffer zone between their teeth and your flesh.<br>  <br>  If you have two people, one can hold the glider while the other clips the nails.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you only clip the very tip of their nails.  If you clip too short, dab some regular flour on it to stop the bleeding and keep an eye on them that they aren't having any problems.<br>  <br>  You can get some fantastic ideas and suggestions to help you with all aspects of your glider at GliderCentral.  www.glidercentral.net|`|nMe35c9Aaa	you really should not do anything with there nails. they are climbing animals and if you do anything to there nails they will not be able to cling on. i know it is irriating to get scratched , i have a tree squirrel which have much worse nails, my arms always have tiny scratches all over them, but its part on what comes along with owning one. you don't want your little guy to fall do you?|`|RGYUugGoaa	The best way to clip their nails is to only clip the very tips. If your concerned use a magnifying glass. i say use a magnifying glass because sugar gliders have veins in their nails that can cause issues with their health do to the blooding that can come of cutting their nails to short. The most convenient and safest way to get their nails short is to insert a nail trimmer in the wheel. google wodent wheels to find the roper attachments( yes wodent not rodent)|`|SXfFI05Gaa	File them carefully.

Then let them play. After a while he should realize jumping is bad - but it;s a formal part of puppy play, and it's how they do it. Normal puppy behavior. Hope I helped.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Unless your post is missing something I don't see what the problem is.

It probably seems more of a problem because he is bigger than your average 11 wk old puppy. It's like expecting a 2 year old child to share his toys perfectly every time.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are socialising him reasonably well so just give him time to mature a bit. Malamutes and especially males are naturally very dominant dogs so keep up the socialising, there is no such thing as too much. Make sure that he gets plenty of exercise when he is a bit older too because mals are working dogs and like collies are incredibly intelligent and need to burn off all their energy.<br>  Something where he gets to use his mind would be great for him too, something like agility, flyball or of course there are pulling clubs, not many in the UK and most are done with wheeled buggies as opposed to sleds but to do something that he has been bred to do would be really beneficial to him and you will end up with a happier, better behaved dog. Get advice though about what age to start them on this sort of thing, mals can have hip problems so they should over do this sort of exercise when young.<br>  <br>  Have a look here<br>  <a href="http://www.webheads.co.uk/sleddog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webheads.co.uk/sleddog/</a>
nZg00MQOaa	Most often, barking results from boredom, fear, or frustration.<br>  If you don't hear him do it, but you hear about it from neighbors, it's likely your dog barks out of boredom when you're not around. In short, he enjoys barking--it's a way to occupy himself when he's left alone.<br>  Fear barking, on the other hand, is a stress response. It's caused by something unknown to the dog, such as a sudden noise or another dog's bark. Fear barking can also result from sights and sounds a dog finds disconcerting, like skateboards or sirens. In these cases, dogs bark to send a clear message to whatever's scaring them: Stay away!<br>  A third type is frustration barking. This occurs when the dog is denied access to something he desperately wants, such as a favorite toy, a piece of steak, or the terrier on the other side of the fence.<br>  <br>  Here's how to stop her <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=623425499588101820343877531677" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=623425499588...</a>|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	sounds like you need to try training her. perhaps some classes.<br>  be cheaper than a lawsuit.<br>  is she leashed when you go on walks?<br>  try a head halter. you can find them at most pet supply stores.|`|euwbbibZaa	you might need training.

AoSeHXeQaa	Dogs are pack animals, so they definitely get lonely and bored when they are left alone a lot. I have had at least two dogs for years, because I work, and I didnt think it was fair to leave my dogs alone all day.<br>  <br>  Four hours a day isnt too bad for a dog, but most of the Labs I have known are very social, and would enjoy having another dog to play with.<br>  <br>  There are lots of dog buddies you could rescue :o)<br>  <br>  My dogs definitely help with training the foster dogs I bring in - if only by setting a good example.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Of course a dog can get lonely, but being alone 4 hours shouldn't get them so lonely they're upset.<br>  <br>  An adult dog sleeps an increadible amount of it's life away and most of them are content to just snooze away while you're out of the house.  And, it's good for them to have time just be a dog without you being there.  <br>  <br>  The ONLY good reason for getting a second dog is because YOU want a second dog.  Getting one to be company for your first dog doesn't always work out the way you think it will.  Some dogs actually perfer to be the only dog getting attention from you when you are home.

They don't usually mature until about 2 or so.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider adopting.

Any proper training I do on a one to one basis so they listen to me only.

They can only reach ankles, I guess.|`|14b8d6b25a350fc05dceefa9b229f6cfaa	1. A lot of small dogs bark...a lot.  It's their defense mechanism in some ways, since they're so little.  And a lot of people who have little dogs don't really train them NOT to bark.  Since their barks tend to be higher in pitch than larger dogs, people tend to call them "yappers."<br>  <br>  2. The ankle is as far as they can reach, so that's the highest they can bite, if they're going to while you're standing.  Smaller dogs are, again, often untrained and can have more aggression issues than larger dogs (Dachshunds, Jack Russell terriers, and chihuahuas are at the top of the aggression list).<br>  <br>  Please note: A well-trained little dog is a wonderful thing.  But a LOT of owners treat them like babies and don't give them any rules or training, thus creating little monsters.|`|L22hVXTIaa	MP Australian Shepherd Lover - I couldn't agree more!.  All too often on this forum people talk about the Pit Bull phobia and how all too often a few untrained, unsocialized dogs define an entire breed.  Its' stereotyping and it is seldom accurate.  I own four Chis - NONE of whom are yappers, or ankle biters.  Obviously, if a small breed dog were going to bite, the ankles are the part of the body closest to the floor so that's what they'd go for.  But, mine are well trained, well socialized and well behaved.  If I've said it once, I've said it 1,000 time - dogs, ALL dogs are a reflection of their owners and their environment - PERIOD!|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	Misconception of small dogs, my Chihuahuas are not biters, nor do they bark, however the dumb pit mixes downstairs bark all day, especially when I have to work the night shift.  ( Pits also have this bad rep for being vicious, but it's not true about all of  them, so it's not that I don't like pits in general, just that the ones downstairs from me drive me nuts) but basically everyone else got it before me small dogs can only reach "your ankles" and they have an annoying bark.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Because she suffer from BDS..... Big Dog Syndrome. They think they are bada** little devils.<br>  <br>  Also because small dogs are so cute and cuddly  and the majority of people baby talk to  them. In fear that they are more fragile. So they get away with a lot more things. My friend has a Sharpshitz (mix) that is a little thing. And when Kudos does something wrong she still baby talks the dog. And when the dog does something good she baby talks it again. So tell me where the line is when disciplining a small dog? They come to learn that baby talk is good and its not scary so I never do anything wrong.<br>  <br>  Think about it watch some of your friends and their small dogs. My friend and I were just talking about this last night. And she was comparing small dogs to large dogs and the first sentence she said was, "But small dogs are hard to be stern with, they are harder to train!" BS thats all I have to say. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|QLopvWKDaa	I know that it is because of a perception that small dogs bark allot, but honestly, my yorkie only barks at squirrels or trespassers- he is a very good watch dog, as far as keeping me alerted!  <br>  <br>  and he has never bitten anyone... but God forgive that nasty squirrel IF he ever gets a hold of it- It'll be torn to pieces!  lol|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Usually little kids are called ankle-biters, although it would be a fitting title for a nervous little dog that nips people, since it would only be able to reach ankles. Yappers because they usually have high pitched barks, like a yap.|`|SXfFI05Gaa	Often they are.
XagPxe7Faa	Yep.  "Yorkie" is just the short and sweet version.<br>  <br>  Kind of like "Lab" instead of Labrador.<br>  "Peke" instead of Pekingese.<br>  "Rottie" instead of Rottweiler<br>  "Pit" instead of Pit Bull Terrier|`|rx0ekB9Paa	im pretty sure. yorkie is just a shorter way of saying it,like a yorkie poo is a yorkshire/poodle.

Zk24m0V8aa	Give her time, and practice walking on the leash a while longer. Make sure she walks beside you when she's on the leash, and doesn't wander around, or pull you forward. Personally, I wouldn't walk a dog without a leash unless it's in a field or other area that doesn't have traffic, no matter how obedient she is. <br>  <br>  Chihuahuas are extremely attached to their humans. It's been bred into them to be lap dogs. Try teaching her that you'd prefer her to sleep beside you, or at your feet, instead of in your lap. <br>  <br>  As an alternative to closing her in the bathroom, you may consider getting her a kennel. That way, you can pen her up, but she can still see you and feel like she's near you. Be sure to teach her to walk into the pen by herself (and give her a treat once she does). That way, it's just a task she does for you, rather than a punishment.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	You're not a very nice dog owner.  You shouldn't be locking your dog in the bathroom, or pushing her away when she tries to bond with you.  I would run like hell in the opposite direction of you too.  She should be leashed when outside so she doesn't get hit by a car. Bonding with an animal takes more than five days. What service did you do this dog in adopting her if you apparently have zero patience or a desire to get her to bond with you. Respect between master and dog is EARNED, not an automatic given.<br>  <br>  EDIT: CRATE train her, if you would like a place for her to go when you need your "space".  Dogs are companion animals. Our dog is always with us.|`|cSOwqXKxaa	Your dog has just been thrown into a new household and you are not interested in bonding with the dog.  I'd run away, too.<br>  <br>  At this point, and perhaps you don't express yourself well or this is truely how you are, but regardless please contact the rescue/shelter, explain that you made a mistake, and take the dog back so that she may find a home who will give her what she needs and will appreciate her and include her in the family.<br>  <br>  Next time, get a goldfish.  You feed them once or twice a day and can simply look at them.  No interaction necessary!|`|hBiSNoE7aa	I've only owned a few dogs, but I think you have to teach them to come to their name. Why do you have to lock her in the bathroom to have your own time? Chihuahuas are very social people dogs and this might be too hard for her. Is she spayed? If she is not spayed, she might have greater urges to roam and you really ought to keep her on a leash to prevent her from getting pregnant. I think this also depends on the dog. Plus, since you have not had her for long, she is probably investigating the area where the neighbor's dogs knew the area and did not need to run around and investigate. You will have to teach her what the invisible boundaries are by having her on a leash or tie-out and calling her when she gets to the edge of your yard. If she does not come, tug on the leash gently and call her again. And when she does come, praise her and give her treats. If you want her to follow you, you should teach her the heel command.|`|JVHCFXXVaa	To your SURPRISE she ran wild!? LMAO I guess you don't know much about dogs. She MUST be on a leash when outside. She's so small someone in a car would not see her. Small dogs like to sit in their owners lap so why did you get a small dog when you don't like that? You don't need to entertain her 24/7 but she needs to know you are the person she can trust and you're not doing very well in that department.|`|2idlwi6eaa	Locking a dog in a bath room is abusive. If you want a new dog to follow you, you need to train it to do so. Leash it and train it to stay with you.<br>  You really need to be more respectful animals.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	How bout you keep your dog on the leash so that people who own dogs that have dog aggression, like myself, do not have to worry about another dog coming up and being killed. Leash laws are in place for the safety of your pet AND my pet. Be responsible and leash your dog whether they need it or not. Also, you can still do things with out your dog being in the bathroom, what do you think all people have to lock there dogs up to do things? incorrect. I would not follow you either.|`|PM23RDycaa	Why on EARTH did you get a chihuahua mix then? One she should ALWAYS be on the leash. She's small enough that someone in a car wouldn't see her and then she's get hit/run over.<br>  <br>  Chihuahua are PEOPLE ORIENTED dogs. They are one person dogs who bond tightly to the one person in the household they choose. <br>  <br>  Do NOT lock her in the bathroom unless you want her destroying everything in there. They make dog crates for a REASON. Honestly, take her back to the shelter. This is the WRONG dog for you and YOU are the wrong owner for her. Seriously you need a more independent dog, you aren't going to get that with her. Dogs need TRAINING not to run off when off leash. They aren't born like that.
RloOJ43haa	I'm sure some people would be interested. Just make sure you put all agreements in writing so that there are no misunderstandings.|`|kixQWODVaa	2 acres isn't enough land for two horses, you should think about getting her a min. donkey or goat.  They can become a horse's best friend and they do not need as much land as another horse.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	You could also look into fostering a rescue horse. This would give your mare a buddy and you would have no upfront costs. Make sure that if they're only on 2 acres of land you give them lots of hay since there won't be that much grass to eat. Try posting an ad on craigslist in the farm and garden section looking for a free lease with care on your property.|`|hEXb1unraa	People are giving away horses right now because of the economy....I bet If you put an ad on your local craigslist you should be able to find a horse for nothing, then you wouldn't have to deal with the liability of having another persons horse on your property....the suggestion about fostering and or adoption but be a good route too, and yes 2 acres is plenty for 2 horses just make sure your supplementing with lots of good hay 24/7 You can also look on dreamhorse.com, and equine.com and put in your location and then in the money parameters put 0-500   and see what comes up....I browse that way and have found some amazing horses that people just want to go to a good home. Good Luck!|`|l9BcEysmaa	Many old horses are put up for sale quite cheaply so you could buy an older horse who has a lot of experiance as a role model for your mare!|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, that would be interesting to someone who has an older retiree horse.<br>  2 acres is enough land for 2 horses but don't go any more than 3.<br>  <br>  You might also consider getting a donkey or a mini-horse to keep her company.  Some horses get along with sheep, goats, or llamas for friends.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend getting a free horse.  Yes, the horse itself will be free but you must consider feed, vet, farrier, and other miscellaneous expenses.|`|KcyV3EYSaa	I wouldn't suggest getting another horse just for a companion just due to the fact that if its just a companion animal you want that is an expensive choice in the long run (A mini or  donkey would be easier to maintain and cheaper).
ZYzhBhgJaa	My disclaimer is that I have never had a fish experience this before, but I read an article saying that it could be a condition called dopsy, where the fish accumulate fluid in the body, the article says salting the water may help, but if it got to the point of bulging eyes, it is most likely terminal (sorry:( ), there was another section (I will include the link to the website) that says bulging eyes with skin conditions could be a fish TB (who knew THAT was possible) here is a quote from the article...<br>  Symptoms: Affected fish may show loss of appetite, become lazy or listless, and lose color.  When the disease has progressed the fish may become emaciated and develop bulbous eyes and skin defects. They may also suffer a deformed spine.  A lot of the time no outward signs will be seen before several fish die suddenly. Treatment:  In the early stages a human anti-TB drug could be used (seek a veterinarian for this).  However, once the disease has advanced the medication does not seem to help.  Always remove the sick and dying fish.  Your other fish will eat on the dead or dying. By removing them you keep from spreading the disease in the aquarium.<br>  Hopefully it is something less doom and gloom, I'm attached to my fish too, and know how you feel. This website is mainly for diagnosing goldfish, but I have found that most of the illnesses and symptons can be realted to tropical fish as well. I hope this was helpful, but more so, I hope I'm wrong.|`|wz4PmINcaa	Does your fish live with other fish? If it does, it may have a problem with the other fish/fishes. Leave it in the hospital tank, by itself and see if that works. Then put the fish back in the original tank and watch it everyday.
cLhF7DM9aa	Ours would have eaten loads. A corn snake of that age should be on fuzzies at the very least. The size of the prey should be slightly smaller than the width of the snake at its widest point and the snake should start with one and as it starts to keep hunting after feeding the amount shoud go up, so if you feed your snake two fluffs and it is hunting for more than a few mins after the feed give it three next week, up to about 8, then it should be able to go on to larger prey and you start at one again.|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	Depends on the size of the snake. My corn snake gets one pinkie a week. The main thing is to make sure that the last pinkie/mouse you fed it, is through it's system. Otherwise it could get compacted and be sluggish, unable to digest so much at once. Look for your snake making bowel movements in the cage, so if you can't see the food in it's system like i can with my snake, you'll at least know a general time frame of how long it takes to digest.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	i feed my corns about the same age i peach fuzzy every 4 days.they are growing and it  wont hurt them|`|r8ETcmHMaa	You should feed every 5 to 7 days. More then likely you will need to feed fuzzies.  The way to tell is the mice should be as large as the wides part of the snake.You will need to go up in size of food eventually. When you move up in size of food keep the same schedule.|`|AA11037376	Try him on 1 fuzzie a week, he should not eat that many pinkies you need to move up a size.
XkJBLhlKaa	The first thing id stop changing his food, he now knows the longer he leaves his food without eating it the better the result. You are gonna make him a fussy eater if you change his food when he decides he doesn't want it. Stick to one food and keep it at that, put the food down and if he doesn't eat it the take it back up again. He'll soon realise that if he doesn't eat it he will go hungry. Remember, he won't starve himself.|`|7Rp256IOaa	You don't say how old your puppy is but I would first rule out any physical problems.  Call the vet and have your puppy fully checked out.  If he is healthy, simply give him his food, if you want to add water to it to moisten it that's fine. After about 20 minutes.  If he hasn't touched it, pick it up.  Then put fresh down for his next feeding.  Animals are not like people.  They will eat when they are hungry.  They won't starve themselves unless there is something physically wrong.  He will eat when he gets hungry enough.|`|1HxrA0Qxaa	same was with my shih tzu puppie hardly ate but i just mix some wet food from doggy stores and he went at it but you have to try to make sure he is eating the kibble also. if not start testing some other food im sure soon enough youll find what he likes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Npfxb3SSaa	If it is young(Less than 3 months old) look at it's teeth. If they are still budding or anything like that, try pouring some water in his food. Use to breed bulldogs and this is how we got them to switch from teat to dry food.|`|lBkY169maa	i would say bring it to the vet and see what they say|`|yqrW1pfoaa	he's being stubborn. my dogs went through that phase. they just refuse it so you will give them better food. stick with the food you have, believe me, he will learn that you aren't going to give in. What kind of food do you give your puppy?|`|lTsDwY9Paa	What dry foods did you try? My smaller dog was so picky when she was a puppy. I had to mix in canned food for her to eat until I tried her on Merrick brand. Try a higher quality food and see what your puppy does.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	What kind of food are you feeding him? Get a premium brand like Wellness, Innova, Evo, or California Natural. Then put the food down for 15 minutes and remove it if he hasn't finished. Do this for each meal. No healthy dog ever starved. <br>  <br>  That being said, check his teeth. If he is teething and his teeth hurt, the dry food might hurt. Get a good quality canned food (see above) and put a tablespoon or so mixed with a little water over the dry food like a gravy. See if that helps. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Blue Buffalo is a a good food. See 2nd part of answer|`|t2glBSRVaa	Blue Buffalo is good brand. You may need to take him to the vet, just to make sure he is fine. Then try different brands, until you find the one he likes. You can try Solid Gold, innova or  Orijen. All of them are very good. My dog is very picky, but she loves Solid Gold.<br>  You can also try to give her half dry food & half canned food. Just mix them & most like it better than dry food.|`|6t5kQnSFaa	Is he getting enough exercise?<br>  <br>  He may not be expending enough energy to work up a big appetite. <br>  <br>  His poop is more moist more than likely because the wet food has a lot more liquid in it, but for a more pro opinion I'd recommend calling a vet about it.|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	Giving your dog wet food wont spoil him! or Ruin him! But it will go straight through him so he cant absorbe the nutriants thats why his poop is wet. It sounds like your dog may have an illness and should go to the vet.|`|PDoWjqFgaa	How old is he? Has he had his first shots? How long ago? Is he dehydrated? (Give the skin on his neck a little twist, if it doesn't smooth out quickly, he could be dehydrated. Press the pink of his gums, it should go white from pressing, then quickly resume the pink color. If it doesn't, he could be anemic.Either or both of these can be signals that you need to see the vet)  If you are absolutely sure that he is in good health, feed him a good quality food per package instructions.Is there any other food source he could be getting into?Remember, treats can add up. Wet looking poop may be a sign of ill health, you may want to bring a sample into the vet to have checked.
vBIwaQ0qaa	Your female kitty will know enough to not let the male play rough with her. They have sharp instincts and she will tell him to back off. Just keep an eye on the surgical area where the sutures are for any sign of infection, bleeding or sutures coming out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zKyy1gE2aa	Best thing to do is keep them separate for a few days until her wound heals. The vet will tell you not to let them jump up and down for about 48 hours.|`|j9RtdcdOaa	Keep them apart for a little while.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	shut her in a separate room for a day or two so she can get some rest.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	You should plan to keep her separate from her little playmate for the first 24 hours, maybe a little longer.  You will know when she is feeling her old self and ready to resume her active kitten life.|`|0IMf5SATaa	I wouldn't worry too much when she comes home from the vets she'll more than likely be pretty snoozy for the evening and won't want to play. If he bothers her for that first night just try and keep him away as much as possible but if he tries to play and she doesn't join in, he'll give up.<br>  The next day she will (again) more than likely be back to normal, if your vets do a mid line spay (under her tummy- which is uncommon these days) then you need to try and stop her from running around like a nutter and jumping for at least a few days, if they do a spay on the side (more normal) you needn't worry too much as the stitches don't come out so easily.<br>  Your vet nurse will advise you on how to look after her when you take her home and you will be able to ask her any questions you like then, just follow their advice and she'll be fine.

F3FrZ7eAaa	Either a fire belly toad, or a fire belly newt would do well in a 10 gallon. Neither of the two need any special heating or lighting, just make sure your house is warm enough. You can feed them live insects, or just pellets which most prefer. Most frogs have very sensitive skin, and are more to look at than to 'play with'. What I like about the two I named is they don't require a lot of room, and more than one can be housed together. Of course, do your reseach. They are both almost always readily available at your local petstore, and quite inexpensive.

So if you're not very active, or don't have that time, I would reccomend a dog who doesn't need a lot of exercise, or who can get it inside the house (ex. Pomeranians usually find the exercise they require within the home by simply playing and/or running around the house). Little dogs often are good examples of that type of dog. <br>  <br>  Some dogs that I would discourage because of the apartment situation and the high level of energy they have: labs, german shepards, bulldogs, boxers, great danes, and other high energy dogs ect. Anything from the working group usually requires plenty of exercise.<br>  <br>  Some reccomendations based on apartment living, agression/temperament, and energy/exercise needs are:<br>  <br>  Dachshund: low/medium energy levels, and good temperment as well as small and good for apartments.<br>  <br>  Australian terrier: Medium energy level; good with strangers & is small and good for apartment living.<br>  <br>  Chihuahua: Medium energy level, affectionate but also wary of strangers, & is small and good for apartments.<br>  <br>  Chow Chow: Low energy level, does need some relief exercise wise, & medium sized. They are affectionate, independent but may have somewhat of a protective streak.<br>  <br>  Yorkshire Terrier: High energy level (but can usually get enough exercise by running around inside) very social and adaptable, they can be noisy though. <br>  <br>  Now as I did reccomend a shelter dog, you'll know that while it isn't rare to find purebred dogs at shelters, you'll most often find mixed breeds. So be sure to do your homework on breeds that are more commonly found to be mixed. At my local shelter I see a lot of mixed terriers, shepards, boxers, and huski mixes. So when you have a mix they'll have traits from all breeds that they're derived from. Anyway, I'm srry this is so long and my information may not be completely reliable (though I'm sure most of it is). Good luck though!|`|dfnSOpSmaa	i would totally recommend a golden retriever their a good dog if you have friends who come over a lot or a little dog take the quiz in the link below|`|59964a018492ed365416a5a4322c2588aa	Labs are good dogs, but a large dog probably wouldn't work in an apartment. I would recommended a mini aussie, smart dependable dogs, or maybe another pug?
hRikwc00aa	Desenitization - letting him see lots of things - from an early age.<br>  <br>  If he's already grown up, start slowly introducing him to the things he's afraid of, reinforcing interest, curiousity, or movement forward toward the scary thing with praise and treats.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	I would say that is near impossible.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Patience, and by helping your dog tackle his or her fears.  My Mastiff was terrified of stairs when he was a pup---with that big head and those huge feet it was no wonder.  I never forced him. I gently coaxed him and encouraged him every step of the way. It took try after try and a couple of weeks, but finally...he climbed down the stairs, and I really went crazy with praise. Catch my drift?|`|CMsg25skaa	No offense to you or anything... but say you're scared of the dark or clowns. I mean, you're scared of them. How would you stop being afraid of them other than being in the dark and being near clowns. And that would scare the sh** out of you, right? Now imagine a dog. They have know clue that you're trying to help them, and they think you're trying to hurt them. I personally don't think thats fair. I don't really know of how you would do that though.|`|CbyM7N5daa	Dogs have to be afraid of something but at young age you should let them see more things and hear more things. They might be less frighten when their older.
2S0BkT7oaa	Your kidding me right?... <br>  <br>  More future BYBs... Great, that's all we need.|`|fgxajTiBaa	If she wants Prego then you should go buy her some. Although I'm not sure all the spices in that would be very good for her.<br>  <br>  Though I'm not sure what breeding has to do with pasta sauce.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	If she wants to get pregnant???? You know don't start talking to you until they are 18 people years and then it will be too late to breed. Spay her now.<br>  <br>  Add: Spaying a dog is nothing like altering a human. You seriously need to reevaluate your beliefs.<br>  Even if your dog only had a couple of puppies, and you kept them, when they are old enough they will breed and so on and so.<br>  It would be impossible for you to be a responsible pet owner for all the dogs that are produced.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Yes and she may die.  If you don' t spay her, she is also open to all sorts of cancer and pyometra which can be deadly as well.  If you don't fix her  and she has two litters a year, four pups each litter, 8 pups per year, times like what five years or so? 40 offspring of her own. You must live in a mansion to be able to keep that many dogs and be a millionaire to pay for all of their vet appointments.  Then of course, because you don't believe in spaying and neutering, the brothers and sisters will be mating.  Pretty soon you'll have like a thousand dogs.  Wow!  That'll be great!|`|fOLO4TNhaa	You MUST be able to answer every question correctly. If not have her spayed as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Is she purebred?<br>  Has she been shown in a show ring?<br>  Does she have any titles?<br>  Is she a champion?<br>  Does she have champion bloodlines?<br>  Is all here test cleared by a vet like Hip scores, eyes etc?<br>  Do you have a mentor?<br>  Is she show quality?<br>  How many titles does she have?<br>  What registration is she registered with?<br>  Are her parents champions? Do they have titles?<br>  Do you have the thousands of $$ to breed her?<br>  Are you sure your ready to lose more money then you make?<br>  Do you have a list of people wanting your puppies now before there born?<br>  Do you have the pedigree of your dog at least ten generations back all the way to her great great great great great grandparents?<br>  You must have proof of pedigree right?<br>  Do you have a puppy contract ready?<br>  Can you tell me everything about her breed and where they originated from?<br>  Do you have written health guarantees ready?|`|plhfe5Zaaa	Most likely yes. And they are very expensive. The whole breeding process is expensive and a lot harder than you think. If you want puppies go to a shelter.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	show her first,,, then come back and ask this question|`|cY4vg9VAaa	There's more than putting A and B together in breeding. <br>  Has she and the selected mate been health screened?<br>  Does she have good qualities to represent this breed? Is she breed quality? Does she have a good pedigree, registration, ect?<br>  How's her temperament? <br>  <br>  Breeding isn't easy, several things can go wrong. A good, true breeder does so to BETTER the breed. So many breeds these days are overbred.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Well, you're a smart human being. Clearly you've had her health tested and cleared, she's won multiple Best In Shows, Best In Breed, and Best ****** In Shows, correct?<br>  <br>  Prego is a spaghetti sauce, I'd hope your dog doesn't get Prego on a daily basis, its unhealthy.|`|AA12366057	What??? if she want to get prego????

Don't sound like you know anything about breeding dogs.....so get her spayed.|`|tY14vbrKaa	She doesn't WANT to get pregnant.  She doesn't pine away for puppies to love and cherish.

He just wants to comfort you :)|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi dogs have a sixth sense about emotions and can sense when we are ill or sad.  Dogs have even been able to sniff out cancers how wonderful is that?  The have also been able to sniff out impending death so yes dogs are able to do these things.

Hope you feel better.|`|qAGeCYVlaa	Well if you're home alone then he or she probably just wants the attention. My cat and dog always are with me when I'm sad or crying.

Its probably just her motherly instincts coming out.  If its a male dog, they might just be protecting you in a guarding way.  If there is a pack of dogs, they will protect one another, especially the leader.  In this case, you are the leader.  Many animals do this.  For example, if someone is close to a horse and falls off, the horse will most likely stay beside them.  Be grateful because not all dogs act this way!|`|6xTvzJY2aa	dogs have a sense when theres something wrong with u before u even know about it the dog willl know that how dogs are my dogs do that too they just care for u just as we do but they know stuff before we do ive read it in books|`|0D0E4x8maa	the dog  knows that you are sick and because she/he  loves you|`|bIaywrBCaa	Yes, it is normal dog behavior.

And some people say the dogs don't have feelings like we do. BULL!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Autumn!Get a few books about fogs and their behavior or look up on the Internet and you will understand that dogs give unconditional love to their owners and can sense unhappiness,illness sometimes before it happens.Dog's instincts are far higher tuned then ours and they tune into how their favorite person is feeling so that is why your dog is trailing after you.Accept it be glad your animal loves you that much and has this bond with you which is so so precious.<br>    If you were a nasty uncaring person even then the dog might be concerned but not to this extent,he loves you and this is his way of showing you affection and mothering or fathering you in times of need.|`|mTTPLly4aa	Dogs have great senses and your dog can tell that your are not feeling right when you are sick, sad, or anything out of the norm.

3sB49YNnaa	Two months is too young for her to be pregnant but that is water over the dam!  First, get the male out of there and do not put them back together again.  She will probably do fine with her litter but she may well be quite small even as a full grown adult.  When we first started, we bought a sow which was bred too young when we got her.  She had no problems with the llitter and went on to be one of our best moms and foster moms, though she barely made senior weight (2 lbs) as an adult.<br>  <br>  Next, make sure your sow is getting what she needs.  You should be giving her all the 18% protein guinea pig chow with stabilized vitamin C that she will eat.  She should be getting all the good quality grass hay she wants and unlimited water.  In addition, she should be getting a moderate amount of greens.  Making sure she is eating plenty of pellets is very important since that is where the protein she needs for her own growth and that of her pups is coming from.<br>  <br>  It is imperative that you do not let her get stressed.  Do not ever let her food or water run out.  Do not take her visiting (even to the vet unless it is a major emergency), travel is a big stress.  Once she starts to get really fat, minimize your picking her up to what is absolutely necessary.<br>  <br>  Next, after she litters, be sure and separate the boar pups from the sow and their sisters by 3 weeks or you will be right back where you are now!|`|AA11025918	At 2 months... maybe she's too young. I don't know what to answer you, the best thing you cold do is find a veterinarian doctor (by Yellow Pages, Internet, ask friends and family) close by and take your Guinea Pig to a check up - it is crucial!|`|Kx3p2GFlaa	I would take her for a check up at the vet but I have been around these animals for about 4 years now and it is completely normal for her! She will be fine! Just remember to take her to a check up and let the doctor determine if her pregnancy is going smoothly. I wish you the best of luck and I hope I helped!|`|4hFT5JcLaa	Call a vet and take her in if needed, but I think she's too young and could die. Keep your guinea pigs in separate cages.

You should keep track of your dog's seizures and if they become a regular occurance she will need to be on Phenobarbitol to cont|`|b51294b275ea3556e31d66e62f7ce701aa	First of all I do not claim to be expert like a vet. However, 15 yrs of rescue has taught me a lot. The really little breeds do have a problem with low blood sugars which can bring on a seizure. This may be because they do not eat a lot at one time. As with humans, anxiety can bring on a seizure. But the cause of the seizure disorder needs to be verified by a vet. Yes, there are meds to keep on hand for the mild cases. If there is a sugar imbalance then that needs to be diagnosed/treatment.<br>  <br>  The little breeds can have so many different issues and can also get really sick really fast. I would encourage you to call your vet about this. The seizures may only happen when anxious for right now but could develope into a real problem if  you just ignore.<br>  <br>  Normally, when one of these little dogs first exhibit signs of seizure we rub a little bit sugar or something sweet(syrup) into the mouth and gums. If it is a sugar drop then they will recover fairly quickly. And then keep a closer eye on them for repeated seizure activity.|`|Run7dyraaa	yes, they can. My sister adopted a dog who was abused, and suffered from anxiety disorder because of the abuse. She used to have to take medication.|`|Pc7EiyBHaa	Yes, it is very likely that the stress of you leaving is what is causing it.  I have a Chihuahua that has seizures and also my mother had a dog that had seizures sometimes when there were people visiting or if she was upset by something.  The vet can give you medicine to give the dog and it isn't very expensive.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Dogs can have epilepsy, but I don't think they can have an anxiety disorder.  There's not much they can do for the epilepsy, and it probably wont harm the dog terribly.  My info is a bit old, so by all means ask your vet if there's anything to be done about dog epilepsy these days.|`|I6NwduJPaa	i think it's more that anxiety TRIGGERS the seizures, not causes them. Your dog may have epilepsi, in which case yes, you should definitly put him on meds.|`|eJf8LNg5aa	My dog is a Pomeranian..very small.. and she has had about 3 seizures from us being gone all the time.<br>  We have given her medicine, but that is what has given her the seizures.
3p6wp7DYaa	No, absolutely not. Dogs can be quite expensive even when they are "free." I got mine at a shelter and I have spent over 10 times the initial adoption fee in the three months he's lived with us on vet bills alone. <br>  <br>  Think about food, heartworm medication, licensing fees, wellness checks, vaccines, beds, bowls, toys, chews, treats, etc, etc, etc. Dogs cost a lot of money unless you are planning on neglecting them from the get-go.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	Is this a joke question?<br>  The medical care ALONE can be $500 or higher for the 1st year.<br>  and then there is a little thing called  food....|`|mfXDUkRYaa	How do you expect your dog to survive if you can't afford it? They don't live on fresh air! They usually need vet attention at some point in their lives, which is not cheap, and if you can't provide that you could be arrested for neglect.<br>  <br>  Go and volunteer at your local shelter, then you will get to spend lots of time with the dogs, and actually do some good, but it won't cost you anything.|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	if you can afford one now then what are you going to feed a dog on, pay for vet bills, flea treatment, treatment for worms, microchip, injections, toys, food the list goes on and on.<br>  If you dont have the money then dont get a dog its not far on the dog.<br>  If you love dogs that much become a voluntary worker in a dogs home, where poor dogs are dumped because people cant afford them or dont want them.,|`|O7G7E8gAaa	i really cant beleive you have wasted your time asking this question.

2qgg2G8kaa	People fear snakes because of the things they think about them and have heard about them. They really do not know the good things about snakes. They think of snakes as slimy, gross, killing, and constricting reptiles. Most people fear the vipers. Of course, they have venom. That's only to defend themselves. They also fear pythons and boas. They think that they will squeeze and constrict them if they got near one. And people also say that the snake is the symbol of the devil, which I do not believe. <br>  <br>  I own 5 snakes. 2 king snakes, 1 corn snake, 1 ball python, and 1 dumeril's ground boa. Yes, snakes can bite and can be aggressive. That's only some snakes. People don't really know the good things about snakes. The great thing about them is that they get rid of rodents and pests. Snakes do have some good. People enjoy having snakes as pets like I do and because they like looking after them and handling them. So, if people who fear snakes were informed about them, I think they would not be fearful of these reptiles.|`|9v4OInllaa	it's weird with me.  Sometimes I think snakes are just CUTE!!!!!!!!

pvm8wo9Waa	Its good that you are asking questions and have thought about choice of breed. Baby puppies are easily overwhelmed and tired; rather than give the puppy on the exact holiday, you might consider doing this a few days before or after, so that its not so exciting and overwhelming for your puppy. You want the puppy's first experiences in your home to be very positive and you will want to have extra time to devote to begin training your puppy in house manners; the busy holiday is not always the easiest time to drop everything else to do this. <br>  <br>  Please realize that your son is too young to care for a puppy or dog. You will be the primary caretaker.  One issue with small breed puppies is the need to teach children to handle them gently and to do this consistently to avoid injury to the puppy. You will need to protect the puppy from ever needing to feel defensive, as well as teach your child to handle the puppy appropriately; this is true of any puppy but even more important with small puppies. <br>  <br>  Breed choice is not as important as how you train and manage your new puppy. Consider purchasing some basic books on puppy care.  You'll want to pick a reputable breeder, and meet the puppy's parents. (Don't worry if one parent is off premesis, this is common). Make sure you get a contract and read it carefully.  Look for a bold, friendly puppy who is interested in you but not necessarily the first one to run to you in the group.  This "middle of the road" puppy personality can be easier to train.  Avoid shy or timid puppies.  <br>  <br>  Consider making a list of supplies you will need including a crate and pottying schedule.  Will someone be available to take the puppy outside every few hours for the first weeks?  <br>  <br>  Look in your area to see if you can enroll in a puppy kindergarten class.  This will help socialize your puppy to other dogs and people so that he can develop a good temperament.  You will also want to spend time socializing your puppy when young.  Look for a vet and ask about appropriate puppy vaccinations for your area. Your puppy should stay with his or her littermates until at least age 8 weeks old in order to begin learning manners which is learned from other pups in the litter and from doggy mama. <br>  <br>  Many show breeders have excellent quality pet puppies available occasionally. Their parents have been screened for health issues common in the breed and the litter should have been temperament tested.  While these pups can seem more expensive, you generally will get a healthy dog with a great personality if you go to a breeder like this.  These breeders also tend to know their dogs well and can advise you about the breed as well as the dog you choose.  With temperament you very often get what you pay for. <br>  <br>  Research the breed or breeds you are considering carefully.  Knowing what the breed was originally bred for will give you information on how the dog is likely to act and what you can generally expect.  You'll want a breed whose general energy level matches your lifestyle. You'll need to provide your puppy with exercise and training time with you each day.  You may also want to look into some clicker training.  <br>  <br>  Corgi's can make excellent family dogs when they are raised around children and properly socialized and supervised.  Every dog needs training and exercise to become a well-mannered family companion.  Know the exercise requirements of the breed you choose.  With proper handling, many breeds can become great family dogs. Just realize that this does not happen overnight.  <br>  <br>  The more time you spend working with your puppy, the better he will get!  For a puppy in a household with a small child I would teach bite inhibition early and avoid mouthing, tug and chase games. Good luck with your new puppy!|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Absolutely<br>  They make great pets.|`|3zv2bbolaa	There are two types of Corgi, the Pembroke (no tail) and the Cardigan (long tailed) There are other notable physical differences, but that is the easiest way to differentiate between them. <br>  <br>  I suggest spending time with a good breeder, discussing the pros and cons of each breed. They can make good family pets but may not be as suitable for a toddler as another breed may. <br>  <br>  They are a herding breed, albeit a smaller one, and do require training, regular exercise and do suffer from some of the herding characteristics of chasing and nipping as pups. This can be scary to a toddler which is why I say they may not be ideal candidates for your son at this point in his life.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	I had fostered a couple Corgie's and pet sat for others.  They were all great.|`|rVskthkiaa	Some can be they have different personalitys|`|qwD45UBJaa	I have a 5-month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy. He is an excellent family dog. He is good with everyone (humans and dogs) that he meets. However, it has taken a lot of training and proper socialization, starting when he was 10 weeks old. <br>  <br>  My dog is not yippy, and is very smart and easy to train. Corgis, like children, are very oral, and put everything in their mouths. You would have to train the puppy from the beginning not to mouth or bite your son. Also, being that they are herders, they have a tendency to nip at children's, and sometimes adult's, feet while walking. I have not had this issue at all and have never had my puppy nip at my heels. But, then again, I do not have kids.<br>  <br>  So far, his temperment has been good. He is very active and has a lot of energy, and then will crash with exhaustion. He is very stuborn and attempts to be controlling. Now that I have established myself as alphadog, he is protective instead of controlling. He learns easily and is eager to please. I've had no problems with destructive behavior or potty training. <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be, however, instead of giving into the fantasy of a dog under the Christmas tree, do yourselves and your son a favor: wrap a leash, collar, etc. and let your son pick out the puppy after Christmas. Take him to a breeder and let him interact and see which puppies are best with him. Some puppies may be great with you, but skittish of or agressive around your son. Plus, he will love the experience of being surrounded by puppies and getting to pick one for himself. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|PrY5CBewaa	I think a Corgi will be good my friends friend had one she was so cute and love able their really gentle animals

All of my dogs, except the last two I have now, have used them, and they worked great.  The only reason my last two don't use them is because they don't sell them at Petco or Petsmart here.

Not using a leash. Designated dog parks are fine, but I can't even take my dog to parks because some off-leash poorly-trained animal wants to come up and "play." My dog is developmentally disabled and is severely traumatized by these incidents, which is why we follow the law and use the leash. If your dog truly deserves to be off-leash, then I won't even notice it - but if I notice - then yeah, you need to use a leash no matter how good and perfect and predictable you THINK your dog is.<br>  2.

My biggest gripe? not knowing your dog.<br>   <br>  Our pup was also taunted,nipped, and bullied by a standard poodle for about a month off and on.  When i approached the owner ,nicely  and on a number of occassions, she said to me that he is just playing and he's excited. Well when pup had enough he nipped him back. she freaked out and tried to give me a huge vet bill.<br>  <br>  How do you talk with  family members? you just come out with it. my niece doesn't think it's important to neuter her 15 month old am- staff, i did let her know why it was important and that he needed training. She wasn't happy but understood.<br>  MORE GRIPES?......you asked!<br>  -not thinking about the structural needs of your dog. By this I mean, taking care of their needs-discipline, affection and fairness<br>  --keep your dog in your yard unless we invite-i clean up enough poop<br>  -if we're at the park, some owners allow thier dogs to nip and "bully" other dogs-especially little dog owners,it's not cute<br>  -owners judging a large dog-we have a dobie and he can look very intimidating, so people freak out, cross the street, grab thier children and run like mad in the other direction<br>  -no training!! <br>  -no socialization-ugh!<br>  -not walking/exercising your dog<br>  -when owners allow thier dog to jump in you lap,in your face and on your couch-good bye clean couch<br>  -beleiving that your dog is human....sorry...they're better<br>  -and for Godsakes, it drives me nuts when owners don't clean up after thier dogs!<br>  Good luck with  training. With the recall? our trainer taught us to make the reward of coming back on command better than anything they could be doing at any time. It's hard with some things, like playing with his friends, but when he comes on command he gets the greatest reward every time-treats and some lovin'! Food is his thing.

EBDyOPnXaa	Usually when the mother ignores one kitten it means it's too small or not going to survive. You can try hand feeding it with a baby bottle keep it warm and try to get the mother to nurse it. Check with your vet, but it just may be natures way, our cat had a whole litter she wouldn't feed and though we nursed them they all died so sad!!  Good luck|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Sometimes if the kitten has something wrong with it, then mom cat will reject it.  Its a survival thing.  While we want to help and don't want babies to die, sometimes its better we let them go naturally.<br>  <br>  If you save the kitten, he/she could have a lot of medical problems and a short life.  Try putting the kitten back with the rest and see what happens.  I had that happen to 2 kittens.  After the cats pushed them aside a 2nd time, I knew it was best to let them go.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	All newborn kittens are deaf and blind... to the first answer.<br>  There is something wrong with the kitten.<br>  Is it the runt? If so, it should be savable!!<br>  You are just going to have to bottle feed it!<br>  Also take a warm cloth and do false licking on its bum and pisser!<br>  IT stimulates it to go potty, If you dont do this it will die. from the toxins in its body|`|cj31x3UMaa	When a mother animal rejects one or more offspring, it usually means that something is wrong & it will die. It is better NOT to do any more that try to get the extra one to nurse.<br>  ------<br>  sad stories...<br>  Dog breeder's ***** had large litter & rejected all the puppies, they were hand raised & started dying around 3 months. Autopsies showed that they all had internal defects.<br>  <br>  I had a kitten w/ a STRONG will to live that mom kept rejecting... I got her to ~2 years of age before she died. Not only did she have a compromised immune system, but the autopsy indicated that her & my will had been the ONLY things keeping her alive, her internal organs were completely screwed up.|`|27Sh9Dyvaa	same happened when my dog had puppies when everyone is eating try to put it near a nipple so it while be able to eat and when evryone is done getting cleand and away from there mom put it near it so the mom will clean it|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Yeah..i know it's very sad, but you have to let nature take it's course.<br>  The mama cat knows best!|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi does the mother totally ignore the baby if it's put next to her?  If so there are many possibilities.  Mother animals know when something is wrong with a baby and they will ignore them and let them die.  What you can do is buy a baby kitten bottle and baby kitten formula and try to feed him.  The baby needs to be kept warm like with a heating pad on low heat and a blanket over top.  But first i would see if it has sucked at all or can even.  Baby kittens need to suck right away or in a few hours they die.  It should suck on the mother if possible as that is the colostrum milk which is very important for immunity for the kitten.  Good Luck!|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	Go to pet smart or wal mart buy a kitten bottle and cat milk and feed it yourself. you will also have to gently rub a warm cloth over their little wee wee and butt to stimulate their waste it is nasty but I raised a siamese that was abandoned and now he is the love of my life. I found using an eyedropper when he was really tiny was easier. It is not easy to feed them you have to be patient and gentle and remember mother nature may have a reason mom is ignoring kitten so if it does not make it do not blame yourself.|`|0d15VDmFaa	There may be too many kittens for her to care for at once, so she is caring for the bigger, stronger kittens instead of the little one.  <br>  <br>  You could attempt (I've heard this is very stressful and you have to be very patient) to bottle feed the smaller kitten.  Ask your vet before you start, though.  He / She could probably give you some good advice on what to do to help that poor kitten.  It needs some food soon if it's going to survive at all.|`|bJPRwCgNaa	It could be that the kitten is weak or ill. You should wrap it in a warm blanket and feed it KMR milk from a nurser which is a specialized bottle for kittens. Later on if the mother still does not repsond back then take it to a shelter. I know it would be sad but it would be the best thing for the ignored kitten. <br>  <br>  I also had the same problem but with my budgie birds. One of the 4 birdies where being ignored and not fed by the mother. We had to take action into our own hands by feeding it and putting it into a seperate little warm cage. After a while it did not survive. One time another one of the birdies even got kicked out of his birthplace and abused physically by his own birthmother.<br>  <br>  These are my suggestions! Hope I helped and that your kitten will be cared for!|`|yY1PTZ6Waa	okay <br>  think fast <br>  when did she have them?<br>  focus on whether the little kitten is starving or not<br>  what you would need to do is feed it from a dropper, and this is where people make the biggest mistake, they feed the kitten and expect it to go use the bathroom all by itself, but they don't .<br>  if you watch a mother cat lick the kittens behind, that's what "makes" them go.<br>  so if you should feed it by a dropper, make sure  you take a warm cloth and wipe the kittens behind, and it allows the kitten to go,<br>  if this isn't done, the kitten may die of pee sorta....enlarging in it's bladder.......|`|ejosT3OVaa	Take the kitty to the vet.

What a cutie!<br>  <br>  To answer your question, these cats are all what we call Domestic Shorthairs, or DSH. <br>  <br>  Mia's general shape tells me that she looks young, but I wouldn't be able to say 4 months or not.

The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.<br>  <br>  Just so you don't get confused, terms like tortoise shell, calico, tabby and tuxedo are not breeds, but they are words used to describe the color and pattern.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	They are domestic short hair cats - mixed breeds.

They are tropical fish and will therefore prefer to live in the higher temperature range of around 72-82°F (22.2-27.8°C) .<br>  The males do not do well in strong currents, especially the long-finned varieties as they are not strong swimmers. For this reason, and because the frequent water changes necessary without a filter are too stressful for them, a small filter is recommended.<br>  Bettas are labyrinth breathers and therefore must have access to the surface at all times.<br>  Some Bettas will jump. Some jumpers won't stop even if you put a cover over their tank. There needs to be a minimal amount of air space (1/2") between the water and tank hood to prevent injury.<br>  For centuries far East Betta breeders have kept this fish with Indian Almond Leaves (Terminalia catappa), the tannins released by this leaf acts like bogwood, and give the fish essential chemicals, promotes beneficial fungi and bacteria. etc.. These leaves are on sale on eBay and good Betta dealers.

Mammals have hair and nurse their young with milk produced by the mammary glands of the female, thus the name, mammal. Giraffes, cows and horses eat vegetable matter while coyotes and tigers prefer meats. Coyotes, giraffes and tigers live in the wild and some varieties of cows and horses have been domesticated for human use.|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*You were born with that thing in your head.

3O6CTb3saa	Hi one of the males is marking his territory.  There are several things you can do.  First of all get two litter boxes place one in the bathroom and one where the mat was.  Make sure that all litter boxes are cleaned constantly with fresh litter.  Wash the floor and mats everything really well with Pine-sol. Secondly are these cats neutered?  If not i would get them neutered.  And yes you could do what the vet said it will not hurt the cat and he might realize he needs to use the litter box and not mats.  Another thing i found is that cats hate the smell of moth balls, they won't eat them but hate the smell of them and if you put fresh moth balls down where they have peed after cleaning it well they will not go there again.  At least mine haven't and i have tried everything.  The bad thing is if these cats get started peeing all over when they are intact they might continue to do that after being neutered so need to get them neutered right away if not.  There is nothing worse than male cat pee all over in a persons house and it is so hard to get out.  Good luck!|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	Do it ,but spend time in the room with him. he may be jealous of your other cat. did vet check him for urinary track problems?maybe using 2 boxes 1 for each cat may help. I have 3 cats and 4 cat boxes i also tried the mats to stop tracking litter and my male peed on it I think they may smell urine on it from their feet and think it is o.k. to pee on.|`|yY1PTZ6Waa	Well sounds like your cat likes peeing on carpets...well try putting a carpet in the litter box...no litter...and see what happens
Rw7gi86Naa	Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Wrap her up in an old towel.  That way, she will be unable to scratch you with the other 3 paws when you are trimming one.  You should wrap her up kind of like a burrito, haha.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to get her used to the clippers.  Rub them all over her and every day pull them out and put them on her paws but don't trim her nails.  This way she will be less afraid of them.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	You mean your husband adopted your cat? lol. When clipping nails you will need a helper if its feisty cat. Have a partner run as well as hold her while you clip em. But make sure you DONT cut the vein its the slightly darker spot near the top of the nail. If you cut that you may lose your head lol|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Ive never clipped a cats nails (my cats never needed it), but I have had good luck restraining a cat by wrapping a towel around it.  You can leave the leg you are working on free.<br>  <br>  I cant promise she wont hold it against you, though :o)|`|J2mtxO2Paa	When the cat is asleep and snuggling on your lap, gently message the paw and expose the nail and clip with nail clippers. You may not be able to do all of then at once. Do one pay each day.
hetZz4c1aa	Your cat is not a jerk.  You are missing the point, your cats wake you because they want need your love and affection........try spending more quality time with them!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|DtkLsetkaa	Declawing should NOT be an option regardless, its a barbaric practice that will cause your cat great pain and heartache.  Why not feed your cat a little earlier at night, then play with them before you go to bed so they are nice and tired?   They want in the room because its where you are and they want to be near you.|`|0mb78CiWaa	He probably gets hungry early in the morning. I would move the food bowls out your room and into the living room or kitchen where they can get to them all day and night. <br>  <br>  For his scratching there are these things called soft claws.Developed by a veterinarian, Soft Claws are vinyl nail caps that glue on to your cat's claws. It covers the claw tips so no damage occurs when your cat scratches. Soft Claws are an excellent alternative to declawing. They are easy to apply at home and cats and their owners love them. They are completely safe and humane and can be used on cats of all ages. <br>  <br>  Each package of Soft Claws contains 40 nail caps, 2 tubes of adhesive, applicator tips and easy to follow instructions. One package contains enough nail caps for 4 applications on Kitty's front paws. Each application lasts approximately 4-6 weeks so one package lasts about 4-6 months. Soft Claws come in a variety of sizes so your cat or kitten will have a perfect fit and in lots of fun colors plus clear for the most discreet feline. Most average size cats wear medium. If your cat is very small boned, choose the small size. Very large boned cats tend towards large. Kittens usually are big enough to wear Soft Claws by 12-16 weeks of age.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a link to a site that sells them<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754502" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a>|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Leave a radio on low volume to give him something to listen to, he won't be so bored in the early hours to come wake you up.<br>  <br>  The fact you GOT UP to see what was going on is his reward. His leading you to the bowl is in hopes of better food being put down.  So actually you're reinforcing the behavior. If you totally ignore it it will go away.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	Feed the cat early in the evening then play with him he just needs some attention then let him sleep with you he is telling you he loves you .|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Your cat isn't being a jerk, he's being nocturnal, like he was meant to be. This is a common problem because cats are naturally more active at night time when we want to sleep. You have to be strong and ignore their demands.<br>  <br>  - Feed your cats on a schedule, and stick to that schedule. Twice a day is usually fine. If they are used to being fed any time they meow loud enough, then your problem will never end.<br>  - Schedule fifteen minute play sessions several times per day, and especially right before you go to bed.<br>  - After playing, feed them a nice hearty meal; wet food is best. The combination of having a full belly and being worn out from playing will make your cats less likely to pester you at night.<br>  - Eliminate boredom. Make sure they have toys available to play with by themselves. <br>  - Be aware that any time you react, (whether you open the door and feed them, or just yell at them) you are reinforcing this behavior. <br>  - Keep your door closed like you have been doing. <br>  - Never feed them as soon as you wake up. This will make them believe that you got up specifically to cater to them. They have to realize that YOU are in charge of when they get fed, not them.<br>  <br>  Please don't declaw your cat. It is cruel no matter how old the cat is.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|36UeGmPPaa	He is most likely bored.Get him maybe a kitty condo or some more playthings.Pet him and give him attention.

jnzSz3tRaa	its stomach grows|`|Qg1ew0yVaa	You will notice a little black spot next to the anal fin, This is called a gravid spot this is the sure sign that your fish is pregnant. If you see this spot then you need to keep an eye on her and when she starts sitting on the bottom of the tank and breathing heavy, you will know when she is breathing heavy because her mouth will be opening and closing very quickly when she starts to do this then you will know to put her into a nursery so she can have her babies. I would not keep her in there for more than a few hours at a time she can become very stressed out and die. I would keep an eye on her after she has the babies too just to make sure that the other fish do not chase her around the tank too much because this can also stress her out and kill her. She is just gonna want to relax afterwords because she is gonna be very very tired. I hope I helped with your question. Let me know how everything turns out.<br>  <br>    Dave

8NSh1D4Maa	They will smell bad if you don't keep their cage and area clean, yes.  However, I find that the smell is easily controlled with a few simple measures:<br>  <br>  1. Use a high quality litter and litter box train your rabbits.  Pelleted recycled newspaper litter like Yesterday's News or Cell-Sorb works best, I put in a thin layer and cover with fresh grass hay a couple times a day.  <br>  <br>  2. Change the litter box daily or every other day at the least.  Be sure and rinse it out with a little white vinegar to remove urine residue as well.  <br>  <br>  3.  Clean the rest of the cage weekly at the least.  I wipe down with a vinegar & water solution once a week- more will be necessary if your rabbit is not reliable with the litter box training.  <br>  <br>  4.  Groom your rabbit regularly, including cleaning out their scent glands.  When people think their rabbit (rather than the cage) is smelly, it is usually because the rabbit needs its scent glands cleaned out.  <br>  <br>  If you do these 4 things, there should not be an odor problem unless someone in your family is very sensitive to smells.  I have four of my own rabbits and fosters in from time to time (sometimes as many as 8 more!), all in one room in my home, and visitors tell me the only thing they can smell is hay.  It is easy to keep it clean and fresh-smelling with a little work.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Rabbits do smell bad and it is very hard to control. Even if you clean the cage every other day it still smells, but it does help. <br>  <br>  Rabbits are great pets but they are a ton of maintenance. Before you get a rabbit decide if you are ready to take on these things:<br>  1. They live around 13 years<br>  2. They need semi-annual vet checkups<br>  3. They need to get out (if caged) daily<br>  4. They will cost you a lot of money on supplies<br>  <br>  If you have more rabbit care questions you can contact me at- bunnyhelp@hotmail.com|`|YpEswTQdaa	I don't think they do.<br>  <br>  Neutering helps reduce the smell,regular cleaning of the Hutch/Cage also bedding such as 'Carefresh' helps to remove odours.<br>  <br>  Pros~Rabbits are intelligent pets,capable of learning many things. Rabbit 'show-jumping' as in the horse world has become very popular,first started in Sweden. Rabbits love to exercise,so its perfect for them! They are affectionate creatures & are great house pets. Rabbits can be litter trained as cats can. Cons: Rabbits DO need space & time,more than most people think. They can scratch hard if mishandled. Unaltered rabbits can be very destructive.<br>  <br>  I love rabbits,& wouldn't be me without the little chaps,best of luck.xxx|`|meMF69tXaa	Do not use wood shavings in the cage. Again, it causes resp. problems, liver and kidney damage to rabbits.<br>  <br>  Rabbits should not be bathed. The only thing that remotely smells on a rabbit would be it's environment! You have to keep a clean cage in order to have a healthy rabbit!<br>  <br>  You will need to alter a male rabbit (buck) because they will spray urine as a territorial behavior.<br>  <br>  If you are not prepared to take good care of a rabbit, another pet might be better suited for you.|`|0tjf1Hdgaa	rabbits don't smell that bad.<br>  my (dwarf) rabbit had a litter box and as long as i cleaned it 1-2 times a week it didn't get bad.<br>  also don't get a cage that has a grate thing at the bottom because that isn't good for their feet.<br>  and make sure to cut their nails or they will sort of curl back.<br>  basically just there pee smells|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	My daughter had hamsters at one time and rabbits at another. They were both in her bedroom. To me the rabbits smelled way worse. It seemed to be better when cedar shavings were in the cage.
znGpjsGjaa	Rabbits have scent glands on either side of the genital area. These can get filled with a brown waxy substance. You do not comb the glands you clean them with a Q-tips and warm water. You will only need to clean them if they look filled with "gunk". If they are in need of cleaning you will know it as they will smell bad and you will see the brown gunk.
hbp3oBomaa	A rabbit can be spayed/neutered at 4 months of age, but a lot of vets don't like to do it until the rabbit is 6 months of age. Mainly because of things like they want to make sure the males testicles have dropped etc..|`|Idunjsxjaa	It varies from vet to vet.  Typical is 5 months old.  Your best bet is to call a vet that specializes in rabbits/exotic animals and ask.|`|xWNLHMMcaa	3and a half months i believe. thats for a male. i think its 4 months for a female. hoped this helped|`|GBwBwH5iaa	About 6 months!
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	It sounds like you're off to a good start! If you have a constant supply of grass hay, the wooden blocks really aren't necessary, since the hay will keep his teeth worn down to a proper level. Ideally, he should be eating Alfalfa hay until he's six months old, since Alfalfa has a higher calcium content & will help develop strong bones and teeth for his growing body. <br>  <br>  He does need a bigger variety of veggies though and should receive at least one cup of cut veggies every day. This can be bell pepper, parsley, cilantro, Romaine lettuce, curly green or red lettuces, endive, escarole, tomatoes, etc. Kale, cabbage, & broccoli should be fed sparingly, as they cause gas. Fruits like a slice of apple, orange, cantaloupe, watermelon, or strawberry (tops especially) are good treats to give once or twice per week.<br>  <br>  A C&C cage is your best option. Not only does it provide adequate room for all that popcorning & zooming, but the cage can be expanded should you decide to get him a buddy (I hope you do!).<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a><br>  <br>  Yes, popcorning is normal for a happy, healthy piggie! :)<br>  <br>  A guinea pig is a prey animal, so it is his instinct to be a bit timid and skittish. I wouldn't make super loud noises to "get him used to" a loud environment, but I do encourage you to just go about your normal business. He will adjust or spend alot of time in his pigloo.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Feeding sounds okay except you need more veggies.<br>  <br>  Timothy hay should be unlimited, as it is vital for proper digestion, wearing down teeth and preevnting boredom.<br>  <br>  Pellets are much better than mixed feeds, but most brands are still rubbish! If possible, try to get either Oxbow or Kleenmama's.<br>  <br>  Your guinea pig needs about one cup of veggies per day. I always give mixed lettuce and bell pepper - and I rotate other veggies (eg cucumber, carrot, celery, parsley, cilantro, cabbage, turnip etc). The only lettuce to completely avoid is iceburg - the other varieties are fine. I don't know what different lettuces are called in different countries, but here in the UK I feed red leaf, round, curly, little gem, romaine / cos etc.<br>  <br>  Fruit can be given as a treat up to twice per week. Good fruits include apple, pear, kiwi and strawberry (my pigs LOVE strawberries!)<br>  I don't feed banana - there is a risk of bloat which may be fatal. I also don't bother feeding citrus fruits like oranges because they are very acidic.<br>  <br>  About vitamins etc:<br>  <br>  As he is young he does have a higher calcium requirement than an adult pig. You can give him extra calcium in one of the following ways -<br>  1) Use alfalfa based pellets plus unlimited timothy hay and veggies<br>  2) Use timothy based pellets, unlimited timothy hay, plus some alfalfa hay daily<br>  3) Give timothy pellets and timothy hay, but include more high-calcium veggies (eg parsley and spinach)<br>  You don't need to do all three - just pick one. He only needs the extra calcium until he is around 6 months old.<br>  <br>  Vitamin C: This is where the most common myth lies so please let me explain.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs do not produce their own vit C, so they need it in their diet every day. If they do not get enough they suffer from vit C deficiency - known as scurvy.<br>  <br>  The best - and only - way to ensure your pig gets adequate vit C is to feed proper pellets (which should contain vit C) AND to give a variety of veggies daily. (Bell pepper is very good for vit C).<br>  <br>  Putting vitamin C drops in the water does NOT work!<br>  Vit C is rapidly degraded by light and contact with metals. A pet water bottle is clear plastic with a metal spout! The vit C is useless before the piggie benefits from it.<br>  Vit C drops can also be very unhealthy. Many contain other additives, vitamins or sugar which are bad for your pig. They can also affect the taste of the water - and if your pig doesn't like this taste he may drink less and become dehydrated!<br>  Don't waste your money on this gimmick - just feed decent pellets and lots of veggies.<br>  <br>  Cages:<br>  <br>  The minimum cage size for guinea pigs is around 7.5 - 8 sq feet. This can hold up to two guinea pigs.<br>  Males can be more difficult than females, so many need more room (eg 10 sq feet) to live together happily.<br>  <br>  Pet store cages just aren't big enough. I would suggest c+c cages - they are really cheap and easy to build. I have used various commercial cages, hutches and homemade pens for my pets but the c+c is the best by far!<br>  <br>  Here are some useful links:<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a> (This site tells you how to buy or make a c+c cage.

Always feed him a Complete Feed (the bag should say this somewhere "Guinea Pig Complete Feed").  Also, you can get a water supplement that has Vitamin C in it.  Vitamin C is very important to guinea pigs!  If he does not like to eat oranges get the supplement! <br>  <br>  For the cage: bigger is better, and lots of toys will stimulate him.  <br>  <br>  If you get another guinea pig I would do so while he is still young, one of the same age<br>  <br>  Popcorning is normal it is an excited reaction<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs are more hardy animals as far as handling goes than hamsters and gerbils, the more you handle him the better a pet he will be.  But as with all animals know their weaknesses and always be civial to them (i am sure you are! =) )<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Kx3p2GFlaa	Guinea pigs are herd animals, so make sure if you are going to get him a companion that you are sure you will be able to take on double the responsibility... It is normal that in the first few years of life they grow that much! Be careful with too much greens and fruits... Sometimes it can make their tummies upset. As far as bathing him goes, they really only need 1 or two baths a year! They prefer sawdust baths, be careful when you bathe them, if water gets in their ears they could possibly die. Iceberg lettuce is not bad for them, it depends on which type they like. Mine prefer romaine over iceberg, just because it's a bit more leafy... Make sure to clean off the vegetables with some water before you feed it to your guinea pig... Some veggies may have some very harmful pesticides that can harm him. <br>  I hope I helped!|`|P8RLUKrbaa	Hello! <br>  <br>  Piggies are great aren't they !?<br>  You are feeding him Ok, good job with the pellets & hay, but I would suggest some other vegetables.

As your cavy is already 3 months I would not suggest getting another & putting it in with hime as it will most likely end in misery. Popcorning is one of the most funniest thing wih guinea pigs, I love it, all guinea pigs do it. It means they are on top of the world! You have one happy piggie. Your doing well handling him and carry it on and you will have a very tame cavy.<br>  <br>  Hope I answered Well =]<br>  <br>  Ava xxx|`|YGQatTz0aa	I had a guinea pig for awhile...Ok, you are feeding him the right way, but are you putting vitamen C in his water? At Pet.co you can buy vitamen C, I comes in a little bottle. Put the rocomended dose in his water. If you arent putting Vitamen C in his water, he could die. My guinea pig hated Vitamen C as well :P<br>  <br>  Make sure you clip his nalis also, if you dont and they grow to long it could be crippling. And yeah popcorning is normal :P|`|hkYmcddjaa	i think your are taking really good care of your guinea pig but i suggest feeding him other greens such as collard greens, kale, or mustard greens rather than romaine because it has more nutritional value such as vitamin C that they need.  romaine is just empty calories. Your guinea pig is pretty small right now and will double in size but generally a cage 30inch by 36inch is fine for just 1 but the bigger it is the better and happier he will be.  i dont suggest adding another guinea pig because they can be territorial and can bully each other. i knew a woman who decided to get a companion for her guinea pig but her first 1 bullied the new one and wouldnt let him eat or drink to the point of death. so if u wanted to get 2 guinea pigs you should buy them together from the same liter or batch.  i work in a pet store and wanted to share some knowledge on that

wrUsMG4Jaa	Absolutely, provided your dog does not defecate or urinate, and if they do you promptly clean it up.<br>  <br>  My area has many older graveyards from the early 1800s (all stones removed, small markers placed) that are fenced and open to the public, and welcome respectable traffic through them.<br>  <br>  I take my pets to this area and let them off lead to run, its a very peaceful place to sit and think, and if you can spend it with your best friend, then have at it.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Why not? are you scared of ghosts?

That should be fine, so long as you clean up after her.  But don't be tempted to walk through the aisles unless you are certain your dog's bladder and bowels are empty.  It would be heartbreaking to someone there grieving to see a dog relieve herself on someone's grave.|`|7Rp256IOaa	The best thing to do would be to contact the owner of the property (perhaps a funeral home nearby).  Ask them for permission to walk your dog on their property.  If they say yes, then go for it!  Of course, as you mention, be sure to clean up after your puppy and respect those there who are mourning the loss of their loved ones.|`|wTvlreI7aa	yes, it is perfectly fine to walk your dog through a graveyard.

cj31x3UMaa	Back in the 1970s when I was dumb & did not know about vaccines, a neighbors cat jumped onto my balcony & infected my cats. This was just before I got married & we were moving to a house from a furnished apt. Vet said that because EVERYTHING was new (furnishings, etc) I could get a new cat right away as long as I sterilized or threw out the dishes & litter pan & made sure that the cat had been previously vaccinated.<br>  ---------------------<br>  Over a decade ago I had a case of "vaccine failure", 1 cat came up sick... presumably from a stray getting too close to an open window. I had unvaccinated kittens at the time & was scared waiting for someone else to get sick. Mother's immunity held for the nursing kittens & it was fortunate that all adults had been recently vaccinated.<br>  <br>  I *still* cleaned everything thoroughly that the sick cat (I saved her) had touched w/ a hospital certified disinfectant. I love ODO-BAN from SAM'S CLUB - concentrate & certified for HIV/AIDS virus.<br>  ================<br>  Make sure everything has been cleaned, do not get a cat under 6 months of age & make sure that it has had ALL its shots, the last distemper shot should be administered at least 30 days & less than 1 year before you get the cat.|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	I am soo sorry to hear about your loss. there is no set time that you should wait it really is when you feel o.k. to love again. But do think about all those Kitty's at the pound who may be put down they are just waiting for some one like you to come get them. you should not be afraid to give them a home. We all know we out live our pets of course yours all passed at the same time so it was especially rough on you. get a kitten you can't help but love what they do but also try getting an older cat. They are so often overlooked because who can resist a kitten.|`|yY1PTZ6Waa	Well, it depends on how you feel right now.<br>  If I were you and all 3 of my cats died, I'd mourn and finally move on try to get some more cats.<br>  I'd suggest cats that remind you of what your other cats were like, if you would want that <br>  I'm sorry your cats had to die.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	The virus that causes Panleuk persists in the home environment for at least a year.  You cannot bring unvaccinated or undervaccinated cats into your house, but you can bring in a healthy adult cat who you know is fully vaccinated and has been for at least two weeks.  It takes about two weeks for the immunity to build up in a recently vaccinated cat.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Please check with vet who treated your cats.  Your vet is the best person to give you advise on the amount of time you need to wait, because your vet has worked with you and understands the situation.  Just call and I know they will be happy to help you.<br>  <br>  good luck!
hetZz4c1aa	Please take your cat to vet and have her spayed immediately, this will terminate any pregnancy.....please don't get all "moral" about this.  Just remember how many unwanted pets are destroyed each year.<br>  <br>  A female who is not fully mature can have a very difficult and dangerous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  While she is recovering from her surgery, please get a window screen.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|DtkLsetkaa	All you need to know is yes, your cats health and life are at risk.  Being pregnant under a year is dangerous, being pregnant is dangerous enough for them.  Considering its only been a day at the most, you have time to get her to the vet to abort the kittens and have her spayed.  This is **exactly** why you should spay your cat even if its inside.  Please do the responsible thing and take the cat to the vet.|`|zeTGmB3faa	She is young to be pregnant and may not be able to take care of them properly. <br>  Take her to the vet this week and have her spayed.<br>  Gestation is approx 63 days, equaling about 9 weeks.<br>  Cats don't eat their young, with the exception, if the cat is fending for itself without a home and the kittens dies,  the mother cat may eat it to remove the scent so other animals cannot track her and the other kittens.|`|0mb78CiWaa	In about 4-6 weeks you should be able to tell if she is pregnant. She will start eating more and her belly will start looking swollen. I once had a cat who got pregnant at around your cats age. She gave birth to 5 healthy kittens, and she did not have any complications with giving birth. A lot of cats give birth to kittens at an early age. Cats gestation period is around 60-65 days. Cats don't eat their kittens unless it is sick or dead.<br>  <br>  You can take her to your vet for a check-up in a couple weeks too. They can tell you if she is pregnant and any more information you need about it. If she is pregnant after she gives birth, I would consider having her spayed.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	1) A vet will be able to tell about mid-term pregnancy or maybe a bit before.<br>  2) Yes it could, she is still a kitten herself.<br>  3) About 63 days (2 months)<br>  4) What?! No.<br>  <br>  Please take her to a vet to be spayed NOW. She can be spayed while pregnant. Don't wait for her belly to start getting big. Kitten season is coming - there will be HUNDREDS of kittens dying in shelters this year, because of 'accidents' like this. She should have been spayed before 6 months of age. Don't let your cat have kittens that will take up the homes that kittens in shelters need.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|PREUMGZiaa	you should go to the vet and ask them these questions.|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	different cats do different things. I had a cat who ate her kittens she was well fed and the kittens were safe I have no idea why she ate them. Other cats do not do that. Is your girl in heat? even if she is pregnant you can still take to be spayed just don't wait to long. she may be small and young but having a litter should not hurt her, think of all the feral cats who have kittens at a young age.cats can start reproducing at 6 months of age. her belly will start to swell and feel hard within 2 weeks if she is pregnant. a vet can also tell you if she is with kitten Good luck.|`|fXeqf3btaa	Cats are pregnant from 52-65 days ish....You won't be able to tell if she is pregnant until 3-4 weks prior to her giving birth. Some sings she is pregnant is that her private areas will become somewhat swollen and her nipples will start to get larger. You will not notive the nipples starting to enlarge until a day or two before she gives birth as cats do not store milk.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about her age and her being small, I would say you have nothing to worry about. At about 9-11 months the kitty should be okay. If she is a runt, you may want to have a ultrasound done to determine how many kittens there are. Sometimes if the cat is petite the babies can get stuck in the birth canal so its a good idea to know how many to expect...that way if one doesnt come out you can take her to the vet.<br>  <br>  Cats will sometimes eat their young..usually if there is something wrong with the kitten.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|cj31x3UMaa	If she FELL out a window last night, she needs a vet check. Fast her from 10pm on the night before the appointment & tell them you want her spayed if possible.<br>  <br>  1) anywhere from 30-63 days<br>  2) very much so<br>  3) average 63-65 days<br>  4) sometimes|`|BsDv3k5iaa	1. You could take the cat to the vets to have an x ray done.  Otherwise, around 5-6 weeks you should be able to tell she is pregnant by the size of her belly.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, it is riskier.<br>  <br>  3.63 days<br>  <br>  4. no|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Get your cat fixed now and abort the kittens.<br>  It's very unhealthy for your cat to be pregnant right now, she may die in labor, and there are plenty of homeless kittens.<br>  <br>  Goodluck !|`|yaAhsEwxaa	i dont think they eat there young however they do eat there placenta after giving birth.|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	Take her to the vet and have her fixed.

AA11569882	Spam is not healthy at all, but in small doses it's fine.  (I used it today to get my cat to take some medicine!).  It might be an idea to get out of the habit of feeding your cat from the fridge, he'll become a bit of a nuisance, and rather tubby too!|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Just don't feed it excessively.

A serving also contains nearly a third of the recommended daily intake of sodium (salt). A 56 gram serving of spam contains 767 mg of sodium, equivalent to approximately 2 grams of salt, indicating about 3.6% of spam's mass is salt. Spam provides very little in terms of vitamins and minerals (0% vitamin A, 1% vitamin C , 1% calcium, 3% iron). It has been listed as a food that is a poor choice for weight loss and optimum health and as a food that "is high in saturated fat and sodium".<br>  <br>  Its disgusting, and insanely unhealthy.  Thumbs down me all you want, but if you eat spam, better hit the doc before your sodium level blows through the roof.
hetZz4c1aa	A diet of just fish is not good for a cat and can cause health problems.  Remember in the wild cats do not eat fish.

You have recourse if there is anything wrong with the puppy - from a full refund, to making them pay a vet bill. If you find that the puppy has serious health concerns, make them take it back or make good on the expenses.  and don't hestate to report them to the local authorities.  Your state vet at the Department of Agriculture will want to know, as well.|`|EqTh6LRPaa	No this is not normal and should be seen by a vet other than one that is recommended by the pet store you bought the puppy from.

CEgq26oHaa	Seperate them immediately.  Hamsters can not be housed together or they will fight all the time until they kill one another.  The only way they can really be housed together is if they are born together, they might still fight, but it usually isn't as bad.

It all boils down to genetics. If you have a puppy which was bred from two healthy, standard adults, you'll get a healthy, standard puppy. His nose may or may not change color has he matures. <br>  <br>  His eye color can change as he matures too, most labs start out with blue or green eyes that 'fade' to brown around a year. <br>  <br>  Nose color doesn't depict purity of breeds.

The breeder you bought them from should be more than willing to show you their pedigree.

They could have a genetic abnormality that causes their nose to be brown and have green eyes, or just poorly bred. Another thing is: they might not be old enough to start showing breed quality.

And as someone else said, a red nose (brown nose) is a fault. Also, a responsible breeder would have discouraged you buying two dogs from the same litter. It can result in difficulty training because they bond closer with eachother than you. It's also double the work, double the money, food, poop, and training.<br>  <br>  Are you SURE they're 8-9 weeks old? They shouldn't have wrinkly muzzles at this point.

You have courses like anatomy, physiology, pathology, medicine, surgery, but on multiple species (dog, cat, horse, cow, pig, chicken to name the basic ones).<br>  However unlike med school, vets are not required to do interhsips and residencies after graduation.  After vet school you can go out and work.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Basically. You are taking the classes on animals though, instead of people. Instead of knowing just one species (humans), you have to learn 2-4 species- dogs, cats, horses, and cows at the minimum.<br>    The length of schooling is the same, though it is harder to get into veterinary school than it is to get into medical school, mainly because there are a lot less veterinary schools available.
zqVDJxUIaa	When you notice that she is pregnant, (her belly will be larger than usual and she will have a gravid spot near her anal fin), about 20 days or so, the female(s) should be moved to a bare-bottomed breeder tank of 2.5 gallons to 5 gallons in size in order to receive the fry. While the gestation period is often about 28 days, it can range from 21 to roughly 40. This is dependent on a number of factors such as temperature and genetics.<br>  <br>  There are different ways to set this breeding tank up; however the most important aspect is that the water be at least 50% of her original tank water to avoid any physical stress. Usually, one makes sure there are many hiding places for the fry when they are born, using plants, etc. Another way of setting up the breeding area is to obtain some netting from a fabric store and drape it deeply into the tank, secured at the edges of the tank so that the female cannot make it's way outside of it. The holes in this netting should be large enough for the fry to swim through to the bottom of the tank. Yet another option is to assume the female is not cannibalistic and leave no space for the fry to hide. Thus, they do not scatter for safety, and the female does not prey on them. I do not recommend the latter for your first drop. Many females are cannibalistic.<br>  <br>   The problems with breeding boxes are: You do not know when to put the female into the box except while she is presently dropping; putting her in it too soon may cause premature birth/abortion; she will be unduly stressed; most healthy fry attempt to swim toward the surface of the water, and a trapped female will often grab the fry; fry may be hurt/hang in the slots. This item is best used for emergencies when a drop comes unexpectedly.<br>  <br>  A female that is heavy with fry may become rather still, due to a cumbersome body, and more stationary yet, if she is moved to a strange tank. You may see her vent dilate with close observation just before the birth. You can usually tell when the female has finished birthing since she will stop dropping fry at the rate she has and will appear about as thin as you would want her to be.<br>  <br>  She should be removed after birthing, and watch for any possible stress.<br>  <br>  WHOEVER WROTE THE COMMENT BELOW IS STUPID.<br>  What's the point of copying what I said? <br>  Edit: Omg...

Her mouth will be opening and closing very fast this is how you can tell that she is ready to pop. When you see this then you should put her in the breeder but do not put her in there for more than a few hours she can become very stressed out and die. Also after she gives birth keep an eye on the other fish in the tank to make sure that they are not chasing her around too much this can also stress her out she will be very tired after giving birth and the only thing she will want to do is rest. Just make sure that there aren't any fish bothering her and she should be fine.  I hope I helped with your question|`|tShDXmgbaa	Wait til her stomach looks squared off and then move her to the breeding box.  She will give birth in just a few days.  Don't leave her in the box more than 2 weeks though. The gravid spot will get larger the further in the pregnancy she gets. Congrats!
zqVDJxUIaa	Guppy fry most likely WILL eat powdered flakes, but it is best to feed them live foods, such as brine shrimp. This ensures that the fry will be as strong as possible when you introduce them back into the main tank, where they might get harassed by the aquarium inhabitants. You can also feed the cooked egg yolk, which provides lots of yummy protein the fry love. Liquid fry food (available at your local fish store) can also be fed. When you introduce them to the main tank (after a couple weeks) make sure there are lots of plants for the fry to hide in. <br>  <br>  TAYLOR: THEN WHY DOES MY COMMENT COME FIRST??? WHY DOES MINE SAY THAT IT CAME BEFORE YOU??? Gosh, some people are dumb. In case you didn't know, it says how long ago the comment was given (at the bottom).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tShDXmgbaa	I recommend flakes that are crushed to a powder consistency.  Brine shrimp are such a hassle and egg yolk is just plain messy and easily fouls the water.  You can mix a variety of flakes and the guppies will thank you for it :) good luck!

84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I have 2 cats, and they both were indoor cats. One of them would always sit by the door and cry his head off cuz he wanted to go outside. We would let him go outside and watch him. He was fine. And one time he just took off running across the neighborhood. But he came back after a while. That's kinda how it started. Now he will sit at the door in the morning and waits for us to let him out. I haven't let him go outside very much in the winter though. But when he goes, he'll come back. We never tought him, it just happened. He is still not a 100% outdoor cat. He sleeps inside and spends most of the day inside. He just goes out for a few hours during the day. Sometimes he's gone all day when we are at work, but he always waits for us at the door when we come back.<br>  Our other cat will go outside sometimes but she turns around after about 2 seconds and comes right back in. We couldn't make her an outdoor cat if we wanted to. <br>  Does your cat generally like to go outside? Try to take her outside, maybe on a leash or something so she can get used to it. <br>  If you do manage to make her an outdoor cat, make sure she has all her vaccines. Our little man has gotten in a fight and thank god he had his vaccines. Supposedly the other cat was a stray that is known for killing other cats because it carries all kinds of deseases. Fortunately our little man was fine. But you have to be aware of all that.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	why the hell would you do that to your poor cat.  talk about neglecting and abandoning the poor thing.  keep your cat as an indoor cat or find a home that will keep her as an indoor cat.  no good ever comes from cats going outside|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	introduce the cat to the garden for about an half hour a day, keep an eye on him, he will be a bit nervous at first, make sure there are no dangerous roads in the area, as i wouldnt recommend letting him out if this is the case.<br>  Cats are very intelligent, i have 8 cats, i do find that cats love being outside more than being inside but do bear in mind more accidents can happen outside in the wild,i have found that i have been so worried in the past when they go out, my first cat i got a lead and i took him out each day on the lead in the garden, and one day he got under the fence the lead came off, and i was calling and calling him, crying my eyes out and panicking, then about 20 mins later he popped his head up from the end of the fence, and ran away again, evenually after around an hour, he decided he would come close enough for me to return him back to safety but he loved it.<br>  A good tip is let the cat out before you feed him, and you can call him in, for food, as a fed cat is a happy cat so you will never get him back in, if you feed him before he goes out.<br>  The whole training process is very quick but just introduce him to the garden a bit at first, as sometimes they do get into trouble and end up too high in trees or in my cats case on top of a garden shed,2 doors down and the people were out at the time and he cried and cried and i kept calling him, and all of a sudden there was thunder and lightening and a huge downpour and he came down so quick so they do learn very quick and the answer to your qustion is yes he would be ready for summer, and they would know how to come back there is also an old wifes tale that if you put a little bit of butter on the cats paws he will follow the scent back home but they are really clever and they do come back when they want to(of course), a cat flap is a great idea too as otherwise you find you are opening the door and closing it all day,as they can neer make up their minds if they want to come in or go out, but with a cat flap he can come and go as he pleases and hope this helps.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Why would you want to?<br>  <br>  Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|zKyy1gE2aa	I would put her on a cat leash for the first month at least so she can get use to her surroundings and the smell of where you live. A lot of cats get lost by being outdoor cats, people tend to think they are strays and feed them and end up keeping them as their own. Also, I wouldn't let him/her outside if they have been declawed, that's what they use for protection. It's really just not a good idea, I know, it's easier than cleaning out a litter box though.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	That's the equivalent of giving the car keys to your 16 year old.

Cats have very strong instincts as well. She knows she has a good home and won't stray far. Just don't leave her out when you go anywhere. I once adopted a cat that I got from a lady who really didn't care about her cat. While the lady was at work all day male cats used to gang up on her cat. Poor cat was all scared up with wounds and loss of fur. After I took the cat home I never let her out again. She adapted pretty well and became a happy and healthy in door cat.|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	what we did to make our cat an outdoor cat was start putting his food out side so that he could start to know that he can come out here to eat. if it's her first time exploring then what you do is put some butter on all of her paws and let her explore, anytime that she gets lost then she can follow the scent of the butter back to home, after putting on butter that one time then she knows how to get around! If she doesn't want to go out side then show her that your outside and it's ok.<br>  <br>  p.s. for all you people who believe in just having indoor cats and that it's best to keep them inside because of their health, then what about millions of years ago when cats didn't know what the indoors were? they do just as fine, and that's why there here today. But I would never put a kitten outside, just so you know. when there a year, then it's time for them to explore.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	negative. do not make your cat go outside.
BdlGBdE5aa	Here is a copy of an answer that I just gave to another question about dog bad breath.  It may answer your question:<br>  Based on my past experience you are not going to like my answer but here goes. The major cause of bad breath in humans is the tongue where bacteria grow and produce the bad breath. It is the same for the dog. Dog bad breath is primarily due to the bacteria on the tongue. In order to "cure" bad breath this bacteria must be removed on a regular basis. The only tongue cleaner that I know of that can be used on a dog is OraBrush because it is both a brush and a scraper. It is very gentle but effective. I have seen a Vet clean a dog's tongue with OraBrush and it worked very well. Here is their website if you are interested: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a> Mints and gum or similar products for the dog just cover up the bad breath for a short time. To get rid of bad breath you must remove the cause of bad breath.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	you will probably want to take your puppy to the vet.  bad breath in dogs can be an indicator of many health problems.  my old dog always had bad breath and then he dies of kidney failure at 4 years old.  perhaps the vet can take a look at the dogs teeth.  if he doesn't see anything wrong you may want to get blood tests done to check how the internal organs are.  it can be a bit expensive but it is better to be safe than sorry.  plus, i think all puppies should have this bloodwork done occasionally just to be safe.  i would hate for your dog to be sick and you guys not know until it is too late.|`|qapJU3tMaa	I'm afraid that I don't know what YOIN is.

MFZr5yhAaa	Do you ever vaccum the gravel in your tank? All I can think of is that maybe you havent done that in the year you've had the tank, and that you've disturbed the gravel enough to realese gases? Have you done anything else? Like change filters, add more fish? When you do your water changes, do you use tap water? Have you ever tested your tap water? (bc, sometimes, like here, the tap water itself tests at over 1 almost 2 for ammonia.) If you test your water, has there been any big changes in the pH?

If you didn't they will dissolve to quickly releasing nitrates and other fertilizers very quickly. This is bad, normally the plants absorb this as they grow and it doesn't hurt anything, but if they are just dissolving into the open water the release of nitrates wont be checked by the grow ht of plants. I would recommend taking the tablets out and doing many water changes until your ammonia levels go back to normal (zero).|`|vVAwFgcJaa	That 65% water change could be the problem. I also do large water changes once in a while but it's risky.

That way you won't risk your fish. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|nkmz8OCbaa	did you de-chlorinate the water before the water change you may have killed your bio-filter with all the fresh water if you did not treat it. the tabs do not add ammonia. 10 tabs though does seen like a lot. <br>  <br>  What fish and how may do you have in the 55?

You have the choice of getting insurance that covers illnesses, accidents AND routine care, or just get insurance for illnesses and accidents and it will be cheaper.<br>  The cost of vet care is getting very high, especially if your dog needs an operation, or and MRI or Xrays. They also offer discounts for multiple pets.<br>  This website has a nice comparison chart, so you can get an idea:|`|VVcEC69faa	im with more than it was the cheapest one for me. i have a labradoodle so when i was looking i asked for a quote for poodle cross and then labrador cross if the doodle option was not available and there was a difference in price..... just incase you got a cross breed|`|qapJU3tMaa	I checked into it, at one time, and found out that it wasn't worth it.  It was expensive, more than you would normally spend on your dog, yearly.  Also doesn't cover a lot of things.  Do your research.|`|uniAnFF7aa	Frontline Plus|`|EeJMITyCaa	Its a rip off. I looked into getting it. The monthly costs are more than you would normally spend on your dog and dog insurance doesn't even pay for the full costs of all the shots or emergencies that could happen. I found it cheaper to just set aside 20 bucks a month for my dog in case something ever happens. Oh, they don't even pay up front. You have to pay up front and you have to wait for them to reimburse you whatever they deem appropriate.|`|euwbbibZaa	For my three dogs I have PetCare. You can look them up online and I think they have good choices. They have a variety of plans you can choose from and you can even get different types for each dog. I have two of one kind for my two girls because they are 1 and 3 but I have a boy that is 8 and I have senior care for him. Also if you get one of the bigger plans it covers "wellness" like pet vaccine's. So you would go to the vet pay and then send the invoice to the insurance and they reimburse you and its a fast process. Also you can get discounts for number of pets and if they have a microchip in them for if they get lost. Its the pest insurance I have found that is easy to work with. Check it out at PetCare.com

This is NOT because Ranger is a "slow-maturing" individual or because he comes from a "slow maturing" breed. There is no such thing. Let me repeat that: no horse on earth, of any breed, at any time, is or has ever been mature before the age of six (plus or minus six months). This information comes, I know, as a shock to many people who think starting their colt or filly under saddle at age two is what they ought to be doing. This begs discussion of (1) what I mean by "mature" and (2) what I mean by "starting."<br>  <br>  (1) Just about everybody has heard of the horse's "growth plates," and commonly when I ask 'em, people tell me that the "growth plates" are somewhere around, or in, the horse's knees (actually they're located at the bottom of the radius-ulna bone just above the knee). This is what gives rise to the saying that, before riding the horse, it's best to wait "until his knees close" (i.e., until the growth plates fuse to the bone shaft and cease to be separated from it by a layer of slippery, crushable cartilage). What people often don't realize is that there is a "growth plate" on either end of EVERY bone behind the skull, and in the case of some bones (like the pelvis, which has many "corners") there are multiple growth plates.<br>  <br>  So do you then have to wait until ALL these growth plates fuse? No. But the longer you wait, the safer you'll be. Owners and trainers need to realize there's a definite, easy-to-remember schedule of fusion - and then make their decision as to when to ride the horse based on that rather than on the external appearance of the horse. For there are some breeds of horse - the Quarter Horse is the premier among these - which have been bred in such a manner as to LOOK mature long before they actually ARE mature. This puts these horses in jeopardy from people who are either ignorant of the closure schedule, or more interested in their own schedule (for futurities or other competitions) than they are in the welfare of the animal.<br>  <br>  The process of fusion goes from the bottom up. In other words, the lower down toward the hoofs you look, the earlier the growth plates will have fused; and the higher up toward the animal's back you look, the later. The growth plate at the top of the coffin bone (the most distal bone of the limb) is fused at birth. What this means is that the coffin bones get no TALLER after birth (they get much larger around, though, by another mechanism). That's the first one. In order after that:<br>  <br>  2. Short pastern - top & bottom between birth and 6 mos.<br>  3. Long pastern - top & bottom between 6 mos. And 1 yr.<br>  4. Cannon bone - top & bottom between 8 mos. And 1.5 yrs.<br>  5. Small bones of knee - top & bottom on each, between 1.5 and 2.5 yrs.<br>  6. Bottom of radius-ulna - between 2 and 2.5 yrs.<br>  7. Weight-bearing portion of glenoid notch at top of radius - between 2.5 and 3 yrs.<br>  8. Humerus - top & bottom, between 3 and 3.5 yrs.<br>  9. Scapula - glenoid or bottom (weight-bearing) portion - between 3.5 and 4 yrs.<br>  10. Hindlimb - lower portions same as forelimb<br>  11. Hock - this joint is "late" for as low down as it is; growth plates on the tibial & fibular tarsals don't fuse until the animal is four (so the hocks are a known "weak point" - even the 18th-century literature warns against driving young horses in plow or other deep or sticky footing, or jumping them up into a heavy load, for danger of spraining their hocks)<br>  12. Tibia - top & bottom, between 2.5 and 3 yrs.<br>  13. Femur - bottom, between 3 and 3.5 yrs.; neck, between 3.5 and 4 yrs.; major and 3rd trochanters, between 3 and 3.5 yrs.<br>  14. Pelvis - growth plates on the points of hip, peak of croup (tubera sacrale), and points of buttock (tuber ischii), between 3 and 4 yrs.<br>  <br>  ...and what do you think is last? The vertebral column, of course. A normal horse has 32 vertebrae between the back of the skull and the root of the dock, and there are several growth plates on each one, the most important of which is the one capping the centrum. These do not fuse until the horse is at least 5 1/2 years old (and this figure applies to a small-sized, scrubby, range-raised mare. The taller your horse and the longer its neck, the later full fusion will occur. And for a male - is this a surprise? -- you add six months. So, for example, a 17-hand TB or Saddlebred or WB gelding may not be fully mature until his 8th year - something that owners of such individuals have often told me that they "suspected" ).<br>  <br>  The lateness of vertebral "closure" is most significant for two reasons. One: in no limb are there 32 growth plates! Two: The growth plates in the limbs are (more or less) oriented perpendicular to the stress of the load passing through them, while those of the vertebral chain are oriented parallel to weight placed upon the horse's back. Bottom line: you can sprain a horse's back (i.e., displace the vertebral growth plates) a lot more easily than you can sprain those located in the limbs. And here's another little fact: within the chain of vertebrae, the last to fully "close" are those at the base of the animal's neck (that's why the long-necked individual may go past 6 yrs. to achieve full maturity). So you also have to be careful - very careful - not to yank the neck around on your young horse, or get him in any situation where he strains his neck (i.e., better learn how to get a horse broke to tie before you ever tie him up, so that there will be no likelihood of him ever pulling back hard. And readers if you don't know how to do this, then please somebody write in and ask!).<br>  <br>  Now, the other "maturity" question I always get is this: "so how come if my colt is not skeletally mature at age 2 he can be used at stud and sire a foal?" My answer to that is this: sure, sweetie, if that's how you want to define maturity, then every 14 year old boy is mature. In other words, the ability to achieve an erection, penetrate a mare, and ejaculate some semen containing live sperm cells occurs before skeletal maturity, both in our species and in the horse. However, even if you only looked at sperm counts or other standard measures of sexual maturity that are used for livestock, you would know that considering a 2 year old a "stallion" is foolish. Male horses do not achieve the testicular width or weight, quality or quantity of total ejaculate, or high sperm counts until they're six. Period. And people used to know this; that's why it's incorrect to refer to any male horse younger than 4 as a "stallion," whether he's in service or not. Peoples' confusion on this question is also why we have such things as the Stallion Rehabilitation Program at Colorado State University or the behavior-modification clinic at Cornell - because a two year old colt is no more able to "take command" on a mental or psychological level of the whole process of mating - which involves everything from "properly" being able to ask the mare's permission, to actually knowing which end of her to jump on, to being able to do this while some excited and usually frightened humans are banging him on the nose with a chain - than is a 14 year old boy.<br>  <br>  (2) Now, let's turn to the second discussion, which is what I mean by "starting" and the whole history of that. Many people today - at least in our privileged country -- do not realize how hard you can actually work a horse - which is very, very hard. But before you can do that without significantly damaging the animal, you have to wait for him to mature, which means - waiting until he is four to six years old before asking him to carry you on his back. What bad will happen if you put him to work as a riding horse before that? Two important things - and probably not what you're thinking of. What is very UNlikely to happen is that you'll damage the growth plates in his legs. At the worst, there may be some crushing of the cartilages, but the number of cases of deformed limbs due to early use is tiny. The cutting-horse futurity people, who are big into riding horses as young as a year and a half, will tell you this and they are quite correct. Want to damage legs? There's a much better way - just overfeed your youngstock (see Forum postings on this. You ought to be able to see the animal's ribs - not skeletal, but see 'em - until he's two).<br>  <br>  More likely is that you'll cause structural damage to his back. There are some bloodlines (in Standardbreds, Arabians, and American Saddlebreds) known to inherit weak deep intervertebral ligament sheathing; these animals are especially prone to the early, sudden onset of "saddle back". However, individuals belonging to these bloodlines are by no means the only ones who may have their back "slip" and that's because, as mentioned above, the stress of weightbearing on the back passes parallel to the growth plates as well as the intervertebral joints. However, I want to add that the frequency of slipped backs in horses under 6 years old is also very low.<br>  <br>  So, what's to worry about? Well...did you ever wish your horse would "round up" a little better? Collect a little|`|3LXbUg1raa	Your best bet, since you're unsure, would be to have a vet come out and check if her knees and back have closed...You can also get a close idea as to her age based on her teeth.  If you're unsure what to look for your vet can sure check that as well.  If the bones/joints have properly closed it should be alright to start breaking her under saddle.  <br>  <br>  Another thing I'd also like to emphasize that seems to have been overlooked, is that no matter how mature physically your horse may be, she will also need to be mature enough mentally...if she is not mature enough mentally, then she will not take to or be able to handle her training very well...each horse is different, but if she's not ready mentally, she'll let you know in her reactions towards the training...an experienced/good trainer should be able to recognize the signs...|`|RUxRNsf4aa	The vet can give you an age by looking at her teeth, and if you want to spend the money on it he can x-ray her legs to see if her knees have closed. Even if the knees have closed though, the back is the last to close. So definitely have the vet check her out. If he tells you the age by looking at her teeth, as a general rule a horse shouldn't be backed until at LEAST 3. No younger. No jumping should be done until at least four as well. This is all for the better of your horse!<br>  <br>  Edit----<br>  <br>  It would be okay if she is three or older. Trust me, it is worth the wait! she will have a much higher chance of remaining sound, longer. Saving you vet money, saving her the pain, saving you both riding time!|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Here is a rough guide to telling how old she is:<br>  <br>  She will lose her middle two baby teeth at around 2.5 years old, the next two at 3.5 and the last two at 4.5.  These are approximate ages and can vary by several months.  If you wait until she loses that second set, she should be at least 3 years old.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	A good equine vet can tell you her approximate age from her teeth.<br>  <br>  If the age is 3, you'll be good to go.   She should have a good foundation of ground work already.|`|Qc8mflMnaa	You want to wait until your horses growth plates have closed (on their cannon bones under their knee's). Typically this happens until about age 3, give or take. <br>  <br>  Have your vet check his teeth but if you are curious look up diagrams on line to help you determine your horses age. <br>  <br>  I have a 3 y/o that I am starting right now. If your horse is under three I wouldn't put him in an exercise routine but he should be on turnout as much as possible ( I keep mine on pasture board - healthiest for them). <br>  <br>  Start getting him used to grooming, tacking, bridle, bit, lunging, voice commands, trailering. Make everything a good experience. For example:<br>  <br>  When getting him to accept the bit - have him associate the bit with grain, make it taste good, he gets grain when he has the bit in. He will want the bit in his mouth. Lots of praise.<br>  <br>  I love starting babies if you want any tips or anything feel free to message me on here!

2YIxnXXyaa	Turtles can go a long time without food.  My box turtle doesn't eat all the time, I was going to put him down but my vet said put him outside in the summer and humidify the area and he should do better.  He's literally gone two months without eating even though there's always food around for him.<br>  <br>  First of all, you need a water eater set to 75-80 degrees.  if it's too cold, your turtles metabolism will slow down and that pretty much means he won't eat...making your turtle unhealthy.<br>  <br>  he's got to be able to get out of the water and sunbathe under a UVB light.  the basking area should be about ten degrees warmer than the water so about 88-90 degrees.<br>  <br>  if it's a baby, he'll need ONLY live foods.  such as small fish, guppies, tadpoles, small frogs, small salamanders/newts, minnows, grasshoppers, earth worms, ghost shrimp, crickets, thawed out frozen shrimp, crayfish, ETC. Anything that moves and isn't poisonous should be fed to your turtle.<br>  <br>  they need to live in 85% water and 15% land.<br>  <br>  take her out in the sun for about an hour or two.  soft shell is usually from calcium..or lack there of.  she needs the calcium and vitamins from the sun and live foods.  when turtles aren't receiving the proper calcium, their bones grow limp/soft and improper.  give it the right food and they should start to get healthier.<br>  <br>  the water should be clean as well.  a great working filter.<br>  you could always call a vet anyawys and ask what their best professional advice would be without taking it to the vet.<br>  you could also get rid of it if you can't care for it properly, or save your money and spend your money on it.  i made my dad take my turtle to the vet for a broken ankle, my money was saved and luckily it was beacuse surgery for it cost me 400 bucks.<br>  so pretty much your options are get rid of it, save your money, or try to care for it and see if it gets better.<br>  <br>  ah yes, it also might not be eating due to lack of tank space.  when turtles are cramped in a small area, they won't eat.  they get stressed out and lose their appetite.  rule for aquatic turtles is ten gallons of water for every inch of turtle.  red eared sliders, because they get 12 inches in length, will eventually need a 120-150 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  UVB light, filter, proper food, proper environment, proper water temperature=your turtle should be doing just fine.<br>  it might take her a while to get her health back but if you keep on it, it should start to get better.<br>  <br>  oh also, google care for red eared sliders. the more you know about your pet, the better.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/</a><br>  seriously..go to that site and read up on sicknesses and caresheets for your pet..otherwise, it will die.<br>  And tell your mom to grow and learn responsibility.  you got the animal because she was willing to provide all the necessary care for your pet.  not taking it to the doctor is animal cruelty.  if someone calls on her and people com speculate it, she could serve a fine for animal cruelty.<br>  Just to throw that out there..|`|EDa954NJaa	first of all make sure she is comfortable. if she is tense it might make matters worse.second of all if she has vomited or had diarrheashe is probably sick and you need medicine. lastly if she wont eat then try a different food because if the food is what made her sick then she will not eat that type of food, animals are smart enough to know that.
ITnQEUQTaa	I raw feed my cats and dogs based around Dr Tom Lonsdale's Raw Meaty Bones and whole prey feeding models. <br>  <br>  Each week they get about 2/3 meat and muscle (heart etc) and the rest a combination of meaty bones and organs.

The dogs eat chicken halves, pork hocks, lamb flaps with the ribs etc while the cats get chicken necks, wings and frames.<br>  <br>  Why do I feed this way? Because dogs and cats are carnivores - they have been designed by nature to eat prey NOT processed crap-in-a-bag. <br>  <br>  I have been looking for a cat equivalent of dog food analysis too!!

It is one person's very self-important opinion.<br>  <br>  First, there are many brands missing.  I use Innova (regular) but it wasn't listed.  Nor was Blue Buffalo wet.  <br>  <br>  On one "high star"  food the comment "would like to see more fruits and veggies" tells me it is a one-person opinion.  Most people I have seen who speak highly of a cat food or even a raw diet say "would like to see less fruits and veggies."<br>  <br>  Not all cats are able to digest fruits or veggies well, as I can see every time I clean out the litter box.<br>  <br>  As I feed one of my cats gluten-free Fancy Feast upon occasion, I went to see what it got one star.  Well, only ONE flavor was reviewed, and actually, I've never even seen that flavor.  I am looking a can of Fancy Feast right now, and the first five ingredients comprise broth and 4 meats.  There is no corn and no other glutens.  Based on those alone, that puts that up in line with other "high star" cat foods.  In my opinion, if you are going to rate a food, you rate the entire line as a whole, not just conveniently one flavor with the worst ingredients simply to make a point.  <br>  <br>  So based on that, I would never see that site as useful, nor even trustworthy.  Not in my bookmark list.  It has no value as far as I can see.<br>  <br>  As a person who questions everything, to see that site included in a list of other sites that have merit, puts those other sites in doubt as to trustworthyness.|`|5y38Pdtiaa	i feed them welness|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I feed a thrid of a can of Fancy Feast in the morning, and the other 1/3 at night.

ITnQEUQTaa	I raw feed my cats and dogs based around Dr Tom Lonsdale's Raw Meaty Bones and whole prey feeding models. <br>  <br>  Each week they get about 2/3 meat and muscle (heart etc) and the rest a combination of meaty bones and organs. They don't get 'planned' vegetables, grains or cooked foods but do get the occasional leftovers - one dog breaks out in hives from grains so she doesn't get any rice or pasta left overs. Meaty bones means different things for the dogs and the cats. The dogs eat chicken halves, pork hocks, lamb flaps with the ribs etc while the cats get chicken necks, wings and frames.<br>  <br>  Why do I feed this way? Because dogs and cats are carnivores - they have been designed by nature to eat prey NOT processed crap-in-a-bag. <br>  <br>  ** dogs ARE carnivores by classification AND physiology.  Just because a dog can/may eat some plant matter does not change its basic anatomy.  This means that yes they CAN eat vegetables and grains but that they don't have the ability to properly digest them!!  <br>  <br>  You only need to look at the difference in poop (size, stench, slop, stickiness etc) between a dog fed commercial food or Billinghurst style BARF and one fed a species appropriate diet of raw meat, edible bones and offal to know that.<br>  <br>  ** a raw carnivore diet is NOT high protein.  plus I would LOVE to see your references for the cancer/protein link in canines. According to everything that I have read it is overly cooked fats that become carcinogenic - hardly a danger in a raw diet - and studies on diet in humans are hardly relevant to dogs!!.|`|a29qiNkvaa	If you feed dog food, what brand do you feed?:<br>  I have a few different foods I feed.<br>  <br>  EVO red meat<br>  Solid gold barking at the moon<br>  Taste of the wild Pacific Stream<br>  <br>  <br>  Do you feel the food you are feeding is a good brand to be feeding?:<br>  Yes I do think they are good brands and they are all grain free<br>  <br>  If you do, why do you feel it's a good brand?:<br>  they are all grain free NO by Products and the first 2 ingredients are meat! <br>  <br>  How does your dog food rate here ( <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> )?: <br>  6 star but the pacific stream is 5 stars!<br>  <br>  Do you feed wet or dry?:<br>  Dry food with warm water<br>  <br>  Do you feed on a schedule, freefeed, or other (please specify)?:<br>  <br>  I feed 2 times a day and they get 1 cup each time! <br>  <br>  <br>  I can only feed food that has NO chicken!|`|W0ZQQK4taa	Hi Darksong!<br>  <br>  If you feed dog food, what brand do you feed?:<br>  Right now, they are on a VERY cheap dog food.<br>  <br>  Do you feel the food you are feeding is a good brand to be feeding?:<br>  No, yuck!<br>  <br>  If you do, why do you feel it's a good brand?:<br>  It's not.<br>  <br>  How does your dog food rate here (DFA)?<br>  Probably a 0!<br>  <br>  Do you feed wet or dry?:<br>  Usually just dry, but with the bad food, they need meat in their diet, so wet/dry now.<br>  <br>  Do you feed on a schedule, free feed, or other (please specify)?:<br>  Schedule<br>  <br>  Edit - Because we got it for free and we needed dog food and money was tight.

Raw proteins are healthy, cooked ones can become carcinogenic. Also based on nutrient profiles of raw foods, a raw diet isn't all that high in protein. <br>  <br>  The reason vets recommend SD is because many vet students get funding for school from them, they give food to veterinary schools, many nutrition classes are taught by SD, vets are given discounts, and many promotions from SD as well. A couple months ago they ran a promotion for vet techs, sumbit your tips or something something like that to enter to win an IPod.

FH2wl0OTaa	People who take their dogs to dog shows usually use a power tool called a "Dremel" to sand down the nail.  You touch it quickly to the end of the nail, and don't leave it very long because it can create heat that is uncomfortable to the dog.  Believe it or not, dogs easily get used to this method and don't mind it at all if it's done correctly. <br>  Over time, this light sanding of the grown-out portion of the nail encourages the "quick" to recede, and if you keep up with the sanding on a regular basis the dog will have attractive, short nails.  That's healthier for the dog.<br>  I did this for years on my show dogs and there were no ill effects.  The dogs actually fear the sanding much less than they fear the clippers.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	I recommend getting a friend to help hold your dog down for you. <br>  <br>  When you clip the nails fold the paws back. This will allow you to have a better grip on his paws making it harder for him to pull away. Its better if he can't see you doing it as well.<br>  <br>  Another option is going to a groomer or a vet them will do it but will charge a small fee..Call a few places and see what the prices are.|`|Z1inkvcnaa	yeah, take them to the vet.  that's where you will get the most help.|`|AA10517807	i try the pedi paws and it did not work, go to your vet.|`|rqpuwWWaaa	sorry i do not|`|7Rp256IOaa	They aren't being naughty, they are uncomfortable with the process.  Most dogs have been quicked (the nail taken down too far) which can be very painful.  Think about clipping your nails too much.  This will make a dog not wanting to have his nails trimmed.  You need to change their association to the job to one of a positive experience.  Start slow and only take a small bit off at a time.  After each nail, stop and praise.  If it takes a couple days to get all of them done, then so be it.  If they have white nails you can easily see the quick (it is a pink color within the nail).  Leave a little white before you get to the pink.  If you are not sure, err on the side of caution and cut them a little long.  Remember if nails aren't clipped on a regular basis, the quick will grow long too.  Another good way to keep them trim is to take the dogs out for good long walks or a run every day. This will help keep the nails trimmed naturally as they are filed down by the terrain.|`|Okrs9Qjfaa	I have found out in past experience that wearing down the animal really helps. When they are tired they are less likely to fight with you. Sometimes I will even do it when they are sleeping. Also you may want to do one paw then later do another and wait and do another until all of the paws are done. With dogs make sure you are talking to them the whole time and praising them for doing a good job. I hope that this is what you wanted, and good luck.|`|a0EeYueWaa	take them to the vets.

pYF9KnNeaa	The main thing I tell all my clients, is that the possibility that a bird might talk should be last on your list for wanting one.  Actually, it should not even be on the list.  Yes, most of them have the ability, some more than others.  But the bottom line is, they will talk if they want to only.  Not because of anything you do.  Yes, there are thing you can do to help her learn.  Pick a few words you'd like her to pick up and start with those.  Repeat them often and keep a close ear out for any attempt she makes.  Most of them do not get it right for a while but they need a response and they need praise for the attempt.  Everytime she tries, praise her and repeat it back to her.  When I work with my flock, one thing I do is help them learn the names of things.  It's very helpful when they can tell you some of the things they want, need or just want to do.  For example, everytime I feed mine, I tell them "here's supper".  They know what "bath" means.  They know "water", "I want to come out" and many other phrases like that.  The more words they can learn that are helpful in that way, the better.  But, as for those tapes, save your money.  For the most part they are a waste of time and money and who wants their bird to sound like a recording.  I'd much rather mine talked with my using their own voice, or my voice or anything other than a tape.  It sounds like you have a loving girl there who is eager to learn so just keep working with her and talking to her and the odds are very good she will get chatty at some point.  How soon depends a lot on how much time you spend talking to her.  Just always keep in mind, there is no guarantee that any birad will ever talk and be prepared to love her just the same, even if she never says anything.  And use the money you saved from those tapes to buy her a special toy or treat.  Good luck|`|1omgPICKaa	They can work, yes, but most people use them incorrectly. For example, putting the tape on all day for your cockatoo to listen to while you're out will only frustrate the bird and often just tunes out that annoying, repeating sound.<br>  I reccomend maybe playing it for about half and hour to an hour a day. Good speech tapes will have a gap inbetween saying the word, 5 minutes is good.<br>  <br>  Note that if you use these, you will only teach your too to merely mimic, it won't teach it to use words in context and associate words with objects and actions. If this doesn't bother you, it's worth a try. :) Some pet shops do sell them, or you can get the online.<br>  <br>  For a great speech training course, I reccomend Chet Womach's Deluxe Talking System. It teaches you how to know which words your individual parrot will be interested in repeating so that you're not wasting your time teaching her a phrase she doesn't want to learn.<br>  <br>  It also teaches the fastest and most effective method to teach your bird to talk. You certainly don't need to sit there all day trying to teach her. I think it also covers how to use those talking tapes in the best way possible, I can't 100% remember if it does, but I'm pretty sure.<br>  <br>  I use this course myself and have had terrific results with little effort on my lorikeet.<br>  Here is the cheapest place on the Internet you can buy it from: <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/items/?_nkw=chet+womach+talk&_sacat=0&_fromfsb=&_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&_odkw=chet+womach&_osacat=0" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/items/?_nkw=chet+wo...</a>|`|QJR5WsrTaa	Actually mostly any tapes will work. Birds dont really learn how to talk, they repeat what someone says. Music tapes aren't the best so try to find just something where someone tells a story or something like that. Leave it playing all day and everyday and your bird will start reapeating the tape. You can even get a bird to talk back at you. My moms friend has a bird who says hi ***hole when you walk in. <br>  P.S <br>  don't teach your bird something annoying and something you dont want it to say because it will repeat it and it wont stop.|`|VdeV0jUqaa	Its definately not unusual for a one year old 'too to be talking.<br>  My Green Cheeked Conure started talking when he was 8 weeks old.<br>  It takes a while for a new parrot to settle into her environment.<br>  I acquired my Quaker a year ago and she has only really just started to become comfortable talking in front of people- it has taken a long time to build up her trust after she was neglected by her last owner.<br>  Give your bird some time to bond with you before you expect her to talk.<br>  When you have a close bond with your cockatoo- (and it is recommended- they are HIGHLY intelligent birds and need about 6 hours of attention, being allowed out of their cage, per day. They are very prone to developing behavioural issues like feather plucking and screaming if they do not get the appropriate levels of environmental enrichment.) You shouldnt need the tapes, honestly.<br>  Parrots naturally pick up the words that they hear the most. You dont have to sit there drumming words into their head. If you say 'hello' to her when you see her, 'good morning' every morning, 'goodnight' every night, etc- and trust me- when you are bonded with your parrot- you end up talking to it alot lol- it will pick up these words. Cockies are also intelligent enough to put these words into context- so if you are saying 'good morning' in the morning, etc, she should start saying 'good morning' in the morning, etc.<br>  Tapes do not put words into context. Remember that this is your pet, loving you and mimicking you- what does a tape mean to her?<br>  I have heard various things about these tapes, but most parrot lovers will tell you not to bother with them- you are much better off bonding with your bird and letting her pick up the words naturally.<br>  You can get the tapes from some larger pet stores, you should also be able to order them off of the internet.|`|OmkxSKTwaa	I wouldn't [in my opinion] use a tape/cassette to teach your bird to talk. The tape could, and might bore the bird because it will become too repetitive. And those breeders probably didnt lie. They have been with that bird from its birth. So it knows them best. Once it gets used to you, it should learn to say those phrases once again. :)
dAQHWvY0aa	awww, that sounds so cute, but this is just a word of warning - not to get you nervous or anything but this did happen to a friend of mine who's two cats were pregnant at the same time. One gave birth, her kittens (3 of them) were kind of "babysat" by the other pregnant kitty. When kitty #2 had her kittens, kitty #1 attacked kitty #2's kittens (they were in the same box.) I don't think the pregger kitties were relatives though, so it isn't exactly the same situation, but when my friend called the vet, he said NEVER EVER EVER mix two cats and two litters of newborns. Instincts do funny weird things, and you can end up with an awfulness you never want to see... They told her to move the boxes into completely different rooms, and give the newborns at least 2 weeks before introducing them to the other cat. Check with your vet - they should give you advise over the phone...<br>  <br>  <br>  lol - oooooh thumbs down fairies... for relaying a similar situation... cute. If you knew ANYTHING about Tan Tan, you'd know she is MORE than capable of looking after her cats and her cats cats. *giggle* I'm going to say that more often. cats cats.|`|FhVobWpeaa	actually in colonies queens ( mother cats) often look after each others kittens that includes nursing them, this is done so that some of the mom's can go hunting.

My 2 cats actually came from a situation like yours, and were raised 'creche style' by their mums, who were mum and daughter.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile please get your cats spayed.  Even if you don't care about the surplus of kittens being put to sleep every day, care about your cats.  Continuing to have litter after litter greatly increases the chances of mammary cancer and means they are likely to die at a much younger age than they would otherwise.<br>  <br>  Also have you had mothers and fathers tested for FIV and FeLV?  If not you could be breeding kittens that will be dead by the age of 2.|`|sstPPNoHaa	its their incstinct|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Some mother and daughter cats, and some sister cats will nurse each others kittens and tend to the kittens.   They just do that.   About 32 years ago our cat Sam had a kitten that we kept and they would have litters in tandem and do just that, no problems with either mom or their kittens.   My sister and I also had to cats who got pregnant at the same time, they were unrelated but they delivered within a few days of each other and nursed each others kittens, the kittens were fine.<br>  <br>  The only time it's a problem is with Toms, they tend to kill kittens - just like lions kill the cubs of a pride when they take over a pride - it forces the moms into estrus so that they can impregnate them, and it gets rid of the rival lion's cubs.

It's a natural instinct for puppies to mouth, it's what they do with their siblings to communicate. You have to teach them right from the beginning that they cannot put their teeth on our skin under any circumstances and be consistent.  We tried several things, the one that worked best for us was each time they nip correct them with the same word each time, eg: "NO" or "no biting" or "bad" and immediately give no attention or patting. If you do this consistently every time they mouth you, they will soon get the message that each time they mouth they will get no pats or attention.  This worked for us. Remember if you pat your dog or continue to pat when they mouth they think the pat is a reward.   The other thing we have found extremely helpful if your dog is biting/mouthing from excitement is whenever your dog is excited ignore them, refuse to give any attention until they quieten down, once quit or sitting then pat, if they begin to get excited again, ignore them. Once calm try again.  We ask all our friends and visitors not to give attention until our dog is calm or responding to a command.  The key is to be consistent. It's sounds like hard work and it is but it's very rewarding for both you and your dog.  <br>  Hope this info helps.|`|lvXL1RjUaa	First when the dog bites say AH AH firmly and sharply, then take the dog out of the room, when your dog calms down bring her/him back into the room... keep this up and eventually it will figure out that biting gets him/her no where, goldens are a really smart breed so it should catch on fast!<br>  Good luck with the training!|`|DGCIrUBcaa	Pet Smart and other pet supply supply stores sell a product called "Bitter Apple". It comes in a spray bottle and most dogs hate the taste of it. It's all natural and non toxic for humans and animals.<br>  <br>  When my shepard was a pup we had the same problem. He was always biting my 4 yr. old.  We just sprayed this on his hands and arms and the dog stopped biting. It also worked great for keeping him out of the garbage.|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  <br>  Here is how it’s done:<br>  Take him by the jowl on the top pinch to the bottom and shut the mouth.  Say "no, no, no, no bite" repeat it 2x.  End with a tap on the nose...nothing is to be done in a loud voice...just keep it easy yet stern.  If you just keep it a teaching moment they will learn.  I am guessing the little one is teething so just like children they need something to chew on.  After the no bite process...hand your pup the toy of preference to chew on.  Just state matter of factly "here's your toy" then play a bit to avert attention to the toy.  He will catch on if you stay consistent and cool headed.  If you teach him to sit you can just avert attention to a command then hand him the toy after the no bite command is used.  It is just a matter of them learning appropriate gnawing...it's necessary for healthy teeth, but not necessary for your flesh.  :)  Have fun...the puppy stage doesn't last near long enough.  I just love their look when they come upon some new discovery.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Make sure she goes for a little walk on a leash, and carry a squeaky toy - to tire her out.  Puppies need exercise that does not involve aiming their mouth at you. Luckliy, you can walk faster than she can, probablyw ithout even trying.  Shuffle your feet so you don't step on her, and keep the squeaker in your pocket but make the noise so she wants to follow you.<br>  <br>    For your hands, get some icky medicinal mouthwash like the original Listerine, and a little spray bottle, and spray your hands.  She wont be so interested in teething on you any more.<br>   <br>     A nylarope toy soaked in water and frozen will help sooth her gums, as will a couple of latex squeaky toys and a dentabone or original nylabone - the soft kind for now.<br>  <br>    And make sure in between exercise, she also gets the proper amount of sleep.  Puppies sometimes get played with so much they actually get overtired, and frantic, and people don't realize they are really only good for about a half hour and then they need to go in their handy-dandy carrying case for a little nappy-poo.<br>  <br>    Whhile you should always tell her a stern NOoooo if she bites or does something you don't want her to do, be careful not to scare her - she's just a baby, an this is what babies do.  You probably need a medium sized pen, as well, to separate her from you, your shoes, the newspaper, the cat, your laundry, electrical cords, the towels, the toilet paper, your feet....<br>  <br>    Good luck!

Our dishes do get washed in a dishwasher, but our dogs also go out and eat cow poop and horse poop etc. which grosses me out to have them eat on my plate after that.  Dogs are always licking their behinds too so i guess it just depends on what u would like to do.  I guess the good part is u don't have to clean the plate scrape it or anything. Hee hee|`|A0cITPNuaa	It depends.  We rarely feed our dogs table scraps so it is definitely treat for them.  It also depends on what food is on the plate.|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	Not alot, but now and then. Only because everything goes through a 70 degree dishwasher anyways so I don't see the harm.|`|AA11003994	I think its Ok as long as you clean them really well.

t4MN8gcMaa	i don't think you can really do that to the mailman now that would be kind of rude, i would just tell your husband, he will get over it|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	It's your dog too, just do what you feel is right then tell your husband about it after.

Leave it at that.  What is done is done.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Jessica ... get yourself together.  You got a puppy, now your back peddling on that.  You told the mailman you'd give him the puppy, now you're back peddling.<br>  <br>  What's up with that?  Why can't you make a decision and stand by it?  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but that kind of flakiness is annoying.  Especially when you're not giving any thought to the little life that you brought home while being all flaky.  Do the pup a favor.  Give it to the mailman.  Just make the decision to do it and do it.  And from now on, check your impulses.  Don't buy puppies without thinking it thought first and don't offer to give things away without thinking it through first.  Act thoughtfully and deliberately.  This will keep you from getting people upset with you.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	You payed for her. End of discussion.|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	I would just apologise and say you thought your husband wouldn't want anything for her, but because he paid for her in the first place, he will only sell her. <br>  <br>  I'd also see if you could do a homecheck of this mailman before you hand the puppy over - make sure he's a responsible person who will care for her properly.|`|5cYgk9FSaa	I'm really sorry, I don't know.<br>  I've had to give away actually 3 of my dogs before. :(<br>  it's really sad, I know.<br>  have you sold him/her yet?<br>  no?<br>  well, if not, I might tell the mailman that you're having second thoughts.<br>  I mean, if your gut is telling you that you want to keep the dog, then you should.<br>  but you should talk to your husband first!<br>  I hope it works out!|`|U69ofDvaaa	You should feel bad. :( You're treating your dog as if she is an object.<br>  <br>  Are you even sure the mailman is going to be a good owner? It's not like they have the most time on their hands due to their careers.<br>  <br>  If you can't keep your puppy anymore, take time to find a suitable family instead of blindly giving the animal away.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi the old saying honesty is the best policy so if your husband says to sell her u just need to tell the mailman what took place and apologize and ask him if he still wants to buy her.  At least u will feel good about the whole transaction instead of having to make something up or etc.  Just make sure this mailman will be a really good owner for your puppy.  Take care.|`|sHTpXUScaa	May I ask why did you get the puppy in the first place? Just because they are adorable? Please next time think twice before you bring another puppy home. Puppies and dogs are part of family member and they should never be disposable.
RA3p25Qoaa	Large garbage bags and rubber gloves are your best bet. Call Animal control again and ask how you should dispose of the animal. Can it be put in the trash, do you need to call someone to pick it up, etc. Some places have strict regulations on how dead animals can be disposed of. If they're not willing to pick it up they should at least tell you what to do with it.|`|znGpjsGjaa	What is so hard about picking up a dead animal and placing it in a trash bag and then into the trash? Really, buck up and just do it. it really isn't a "man's" job. Such silliness.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Grit your teeth and take care of the problem.  Just take some newspaper out, wrap it around the body and put it into your trash barrel for pickup.  If it's dead it won't hurt you.|`|JBHvnDZbaa	I'm pretty sure there isnt. You may just want to ask a favor from one of your neighbors. Or just brave it yourself.
c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	I second what Kaadish says by putting soiled bedding in there, and even a few droppings.  That way they understand that it's a place to relieve themselves, otherwise they'll wonder why there's a random cup in their potty area.<br>  <br>  This process could take a while, and you'll need to make the changes gradually.  As they get start to understand, make a small change, and eventually you will be able to transition to the fleece bedding.  Just remember, there will be accidents along the way, and even after you switch.<br>  <br>  I always put kitty litter at the bottom of my mouse cages (I used the woodchip bedding), it absorbed the waste better.|`|5I01tsgYaa	You can try putting some soiled bedding in the new litter cups so they get the idea of what those things are for.

5jfEQAlwaa	I love Mutts. But never would I pay even close too that. Is someone asking that price. LOL|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Nope. Never would. There are plenty of dogs (yes, even pure-breds) at animal shelters. In the overpopulated pet situation, it's unethical to buy an animal from a store, breeder or puppy mill when there are so many (both puppies & older dogs) who need homes. <br>  <br>  Yes, it's ridiculous. Some ppl are insecure & feel they've got to have a pedigreed dog or they are somehow less of a person. A lot of ppl will get upset by this statement, but it's true. I've had a chihuahua & a friend had a daschund-both were strays. Ppl can get these dogs from notices on local vet bulletin boards, also. <br>  <br>  It's very egocentric to purchase such a dog. They need to do research into breeders & puppy mills to open their eyes to the atrocities. Not every one is bad-but a good majority are. And dogs in cages in chain pet stores, Please...terrible situation all around there...|`|d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	For a pure bred that's probably on the low end.     A reputable breeder will include shots and worming.   Some also include guarantees against illness and congenital defects for a period of time. Pet stores are a middle man and you pay for the convenience of window shopping for your dog.   Mom&Pop backyard breeders will offer you a "Pure Bred" with papers but you won't get much else. <br>  <br>  In addition you are also paying for the temperament that good breeding provides and additional health screenings to certify that the dog is free of certain breed specific defects and those all important AKC papers.<br>  <br>  These guarantees and tests cost money to do but help to ensure that you don't get stuck with a dog which develops expensive to treat problems a few years down the road.<br>  <br>  If you don't care about breeding or showing your dog than you can find lots of decent dogs at your local shelter or through a rescue.  300 - 400 bucks will get you a sparyed / neutered dog with shots. However you will most likely be getting an older dog and you will spend some time searching for and screening through lots of dogs before you find "The One".    How much time you spend will depend upon what breed you are looking for and what you are willing or unwilling to accept.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	Well that depends it probably is considered a designer dog, so therefore they can charge that amount for it.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	The male fertilises during the wrap, he should physically squeeze the eggs out of her and the fertilisation happens then.<br>  <br>  How long had you conditioned them for? <br>  <br>  It sounds as though the female was ready, the male was not. Some males do not know how to breed, I had one who came to me from a breeder after she gave up with him. He showed all the right signals, then just killed the female, after three attempts she gave up on him. Some pairs don't just fancy each other!<br>  <br>  edit: 1 week wasn't really enough to get them into breeding condition, it usually takes several weeks.<br>  <br>  with the eggs just falling out of her, these won't be fertilised so it won't matter that the parents eat them. just sometimes females can't wait and do drop their eggs rather than going through the wrap.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	First, what are thier body sizes in relation to one anoother?  Body size not including their fins.  If one is larger than the other, mating will be very difficult.  Also, do you have any idea their ages?  A guestimate?  If this is eithers first mating, you can definitlly expect mistakes just like this one!  Betta "virgins" are prone to not only taking longer but having numerouse mistakes.  Males have been known to accidentlly stun themselves and not the female!  It may take a few attempts before they figure things out.<br>  Or if either is old, like most pet store betta's, thier sex drive will be dramatically lowered and mating will be difficult.<br>  Conditioning is usually done in a ten gallon, half filled, heated to roughlly 80 degrees.  You can add some tea leaf extract or a little aquarium salt. These help to lower stress and increase any disease resistance.  Feed high protein diets for about a week while you introduce them to one another in their sperate spaces.  It can be live or freeze dried.  I'm wary of parasites, so I don't like to use live : P   <br>  The female has to have developed her vertical lines, horizontal are fear indicators, it can be hard to tell on some females though. If she has fear stripes do not introduce them, she is unprepared.<br>  Yes, females can release eggs prematurlly, it's not harmful or any indication of her being sick or anything along those lines.<br>  Trying a differnet female could definitlly help, but there's always the chance the fault lies with the male.  Don't give up, just make sure to give them lots of "down time" to rest and recover.  They'll need a few weeks before you start bouncing them around in an effort to find the perfect couple.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	If you go to youtube and put in spawning bettas, you'll find a video of a pair that is really fighting right before spawning. Both sexes can and do kill the other at times. You have to monitor them at all times. Unfortunately not all males spawn successfully. The older they re the less likely you'll get viable fry.

(nibbles her fins.etc) then he's not ready and she's too soon to be near his nest.. he's still trying to get things ready and he has to blow enough bubbles............ she will also not want to mate with him if he does not make enough bubbles.......<br>  <br>  the only way she can lay eggs is if he had already squeezed her... their white dots and somtimes the both of them will work together to pick them up and blow it to the nest.. it will fall many of times and the father duty is to take care of them.. (picking them up and blowing them again to the nest until they are lil' free swimmers)....<br>  <br>  to tell when they are finised is when he chases her away... they'll mate for a awhile.. so it aint just one or two squeezes... mines did it for almost 5 hours.. :))))<br>  <br>  i had tons of lil' ones... but they ended up dying within a week... i didnt really know how to take care of the tiny lil frys... they are the tinest lil' fry i'd ever had.. lols... much smaller than a rice of grain.... i had about 200 or somthing............<br>  <br>  dont breed if dont know what your doing tho okay..??|`|cf87f1aa28522c98acc4676433f4e725aa	Bubbles don't always show he is ready.  You need to have them near one another for awhile when her stripes show and she loooks full then put her in with him.  While he squeezes the eggs out they are fertilised.  It is normal for him to be ruff with her some young males acidently kill their partners.  He may just not know wheat he was doing.  After he has squeezed the eggs out and she floats limply to the top it is then time to take her out then.  He will take it from there,<br>  <br>  Better luck next time.  Don't give up.  Young fish sometimes take more than once.<br>  <br>  CONDITIONIG: Placing them near one another so they are use to one another in there "space"
gjD8pndjaa	Standard calls for 3.5-7 lbs, but since that also includes puppies of six months old, most TFTs will mature out at around 5.5-6<br>  <br>  Of course, thats for a show dog, and show dogs tend to be much slimmer than their pet counter parts (not to mention sometimes we let them put on a little extra weight)|`|GT6396BDaa	Fox Terriers usually grow to about 10 inches high and their weights vary from about 4-7 pounds, depending on the size of the parents.<br>  They are beautiful dogs, both the smooth coat and wire haired Fox Terriers.

Good breeders' dogs will typically fall into this range, or very close to it.

SzW9GmRsaa	When I was much younger and stupider, my ponies and I would go on sleepovers to a friend's house down the road, and in the middle of the night we'd take the ponies out their stables and go for a gallop round the fields.  We always went in our pyjamas, and we didn't use tack because we were scared to put the lights on in the tack room in case we got caught!  Turns out ponies can see incredibly well in the dark.  And jump too...<br>  <br>  And on a more serious, less reckless 10 year old note ... I ride in the dark sometimes.  I got planning permission for an outdoor school but the lights were rejected so if I have to ride in the late afternoon / evening I'm doing so in the dark.  It's not too bad, they do know where they're going - my Anglo Arab is better in the dark because he has to concentrate a bit more on where he's going and less on scary trees and things.  Just give it a go - if your horse insists he can't go forwards don't make a big deal about it until you've checked that you're not standing in front of a fence ;)|`|AA11498082	It's beautiful riding at night...you really make the connection that the base of your spine is indeed a part of the horse and you trust with your life.  oh, bareback, halter, with or without moonlight.  So much better than riding in the day with your eyes closed....<br>  <br>  Thank you for the memory - moonlight on the breaking surf mirrored my little grey....thanks.|`|B38evt9kaa	i rode in the dark once, and it was drizzling too. i couldn't even see my own horse (a bay) and he was a 7 year old arabian totally green, would trot down hills, even canter sometimes. so yeah pretty scary but really fun. and this wasn't even in the arena it was on trails.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Anytime I have ever ridden in the dark, my horses have always been more leary of shadows and dark spots on the ground. Not knowing if there going to fall into a big hole or not. They always seems more concerned about noses in the woods as well.|`|1taf83DCaa	I have ridden in the dark before it was were we were used to riding <br>  "a path" it was quiet and calming and I liked it <br>  I Had to trust my horse we both worked together <br>  <br>  but I wouldn't jump or do stuff like that|`|psNR7hDJaa	Night riding is fun. I went until just early night with a friend and it was just really nice out. With the stars and everything. Like in the summer. I plan to do lots of those rides more this summer too. Haha they are just SO much fun!|`|nDMa64oeaa	i love riding in the dark! but then again the horse can spook more because of the shadows. but its somewhat exhilarating!! ha ha i don't know|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Well, hopefully my parents don't see this answer... lol.<br>  <br>  Sometimes in the summer on a clear night with lots of stars and a full moon my sister and I sneak out for a night ride! We don't do it that often, but its so much fun! I usually wear my pajama pants and go bareback lol. But you would be surprised how well lit it is outside on a clear night, almost as light as the daytime! And yes, horses can see in the dark, so they acted almost the same. They were a little more spooky because a lot of animals are nocturnal and hunt at night, so there was more animal activity. But it is fun if your horses are good!|`|IVPpgkLBaa	I have ridden like this plenty of times, my old horse would be more alert as her vision would be compromised but i would just take things slow so we both got used to it, as she was a little more jumpy than normal but we handled it just fine. I would think that it depends on the horse and the riders confidence as the riders confidence and all can help influence the horse.|`|VnFjh1WRaa	I have always had great night vision, so seeing at night is no big deal for me.<br>  If you feel uncomfortable, you can get a light that attaches to your riding helmet. It is a good idea for anyone with poor night vision to wear one for safety. If you are unsure, your horse is more likely to have issues too.<br>  Be safe and enjoy.|`|8XxMQyksaa	haha, i don't think its safe to ride in the dark, unless their is a nice big bright moon that illuminates the sky (where YOU can see, and hopefully your horse!), its not a good idea, you would be letting your horse take the wheel, control where your going, teaching him to ultimately disrespect your cues and etc!|`|dBRxfRGqaa	i love moonlit trail rides! i can't wait to do it again, it's been too cold lately. the funnest part is not being able to see, if you have people with you. but it's amazing, your horse becomes your pair of eyes and you really feel what it's like to have an independant seat. especially bareback!|`|vx9hCEfyaa	I LOVE riding in the dark! It's so much fun!<br>  My horses hardly ever act up. Only when deer pop out of the woods, but most of my horses are use to deer.<br>  None of my horses act any different from when I ride then in the day! I just have to watch out for branches!|`|6odO4PK0aa	I was riding in The dark threw a feild and my horse spooked and ran into the fence! I feel off and Sprained my ankle! <br>     I think you can ride at night easier in an Arena, Just don't canter or jump! and BE Careful!|`|BwWFJzD3aa	I just rode mine at dark saturday night, up and down the road. He seems to do better at night cuz he can't see to be scared of anything. It was quiet and peaceful.|`|ndqjst7taa	I have ridden in the dark and it is really fun.<br>  Horses can't tell the difference so go ahead and try it<br>  Good Luck|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	i cant ride outside in a field when it starts getting dark. the gelding i lease freaks out. thats how i fell off. ouchhh|`|LAXxaxAZaa	It's not exactly what you asked, but I've gone trail riding several times with just the moonlight. My horses were fine... maybe even more well-behaved because they couldn't see things that might scare them. But they were with other horses, so that probably helped.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I did it twice on two different horses.<br>  My more energetic, aged (13, not all that aged) gelding was delighted.<br>  My less energetic, young (7) mare was a bit freaked, but she was okay after awhile.<br>  I think its more that the horses need to get used to it. it also depends on the horse.<br>  I could see fine.  Take awhile to let your eyes adjust to the light, and dont go bareback the first time riding in the dark. =]|`|l973fSEqaa	i do it all the time, my horse is really mellow when its dark so for me its actually easier lol|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	I've ridden in the dark before. We do endurance and often our rides start at night time on a moon lit night and sometimes with no light at all! Also i work Mon-Friday 8.30am-5pm so when its not daylight savings time I end up riding in the dark.<br>  I started riding my little arab in our outdoor unlit arena. Thats somewhere she feels safe because we have ridden there so often. Once we were confident I moved her out into the paddocks. Sometimes i will ride with a torch light but if you do remember if you suddenly switch it on you must give your horses eyes time to adjust.|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I go to the barn at night, so I ride in the dark every time I can go outside. Imo it's a lot more exciting going out in the dark, especially on cloudy nights when it's pitched black. I ride in a huge hay field.<br>  <br>  My horse is a lot more awake and he loves it. On nights when the moon isn't out, I can trust him enough to be my eyes for me. He knows to stay far from deer and knows where he needs to go. If there's a lot of deer he'll turn around and head for the barn.<br>  <br>  Not sure if I'd trust any other horse out there though... a lot of things to get spooked at. I've rode hot, green horses out in the arena before only to have them freak out at everything in sight... they're fine during the day. Just depends on the horse.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to see around once you get out there though. Even on nights when it's pitched black I can still see the fence lines and the ground around me. When the moon is out it can get super bright.<br>  <br>  If you truly can't see anything then you can buy one of those round light things at home depot/lowes. They look like upside down light bulbs and can run on battery or be plugged in. They shine all around and are super bright.
KQGexX2saa	This is quite common- it is yeast that you can smell.<br>  <br>  Some dogs "suffer" from red yeast- although it is not dangerous it can smell and stain the coat.<br>  <br>  Order some Angels Delight from Bichon Hotel. It is a natural tear stain preventer. It works by oxidising the iron deposits before the bacteria in the tears starts to eat them- thus halting the production of the yeast.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bichonhotel.co.uk/angels_delight" rel="nofollow">http://www.bichonhotel.co.uk/angels_deli...</a><br>  <br>  It will not remove the existing smell but it will stop it happening in the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps Angels Eyes and Angels Glow are antibiotics!!!

But there are wipes, shampoos, and powders that you can put on the wetspot that will help. I'm not sure if Peks should have tearing or not, so you might want to check with the vet to be sure he doesn't have allergies. If so, you may be able to get him some meds to clear it up. Otherwise he's fine... just wetness from tears.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	So ........... you have been on this site before & know how some the answers get carried away.  LOL  LOL  LOL.  Yeah, some of them can be pretty rough,  me too for that matter.<br>  <br>  First the dog is old.  Old dog DO have odors.  That is only natural.  Just like old people smell funny.  & dogs smell like dogs,  just like horses smell like horses, pigs smell like pigs, cows smell like cows.  ferrets smell like ferrets.<br>  <br>  To me this is a community playground.  I spend a lot of time on here answering questions but some of those questions are so way off I have to put people where they belong.  Usually it is on an ignorant question.<br>  <br>  & I usually don't answer questions like yours who threaten us or try to tame us down.  The general public is very very ignorant when it comes to dogs.<br>  <br>  There is no question here that is ignorant it is just that I don't like the threats & infact it could be reported.  So if I were you I'd be careful how you treat people you expect answers from.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with that dog.  It is just old & old dogs smell.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	You need some chlorhexiderm from the vet in order to disinfect the area safely.  Little dogs like that with smooshy faces have an area that collects mucus and then bacteria - so he has a swamp festering between his eyes.  Yuck is right.

pYF9KnNeaa	I can almost guarantee the answer is no.  Greys can be difficult to breed under the best of circumstances and the situation you describe is far from ideal.  I don't mean to insult you but just the fact that you had to ask that question shows you need to do tons and tons of research before attempting to take on the breeding of any kind of bird, let alone Greys.  If you really want to try it and have any success at all, please do your research, learn a lot more about Greys, learn proper breeding diet, learn to hand feed, learn all the problems that can arise and what you must do about them.  Your bird's lives and any chicks, could depend on it.  And last but certainly not least, if you are thinking this is a money making proposition, I can assure you, it is not.  Done properly, a reputable breeder barely makes enough from one chick to pay for the investment it takes to get it weaned.  I hope this will be some food for thought for you before making your decision.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	No.<br>  Its not easy to breed African Greys, or any of the large parrots for thst matter. They need a secluded environment with the right temp,. right humidity, the right amount of natural light, and several years to bond  before they breed. Even then, they may not have eggs, and if they do, they may not raise the young. This is far more complicated and difficult that you realize. They are $900 birds for a reason.<br>  I don't think you have thought this through.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	You would have to have a really big cage and a nest box. If your dog stays in the bedroom a lot, the Greys may not breed because of the extra noise from the dog.
i0ldUGjbaa	Cost of a ferret can vary from place to place, depending on where you live. For stores and breeders usually in the $75-$250 range, typically around $100. Plan on $150-$400 for a cage and supplies, plus around $75 for the first vaccinations. Plan on at least $800 to set aside for unexpected medical expenses. <br>  <br>  Please consider adopting a ferret before buying, there are way too many in shelters that need to have a forever home<br>  <br>  First, you must be sure that ferrets are legal where you live. <br>  Please note that ferrets are still illegal to own in California. They can be confiscated as wild animals. For more information you may want to contact a group in California called "Ferrets Anonymous". <br>  <br>  <br>  Re homing: free. They are not always free people may charge a homing fee to make sure that they go to a good home. <br>  <br>  From a private breeder: Maybe $125 to $400 depending on the color or if the ferret is from championship bloodlines <br>  <br>  Add on additional prices for extra procedures (neuter/spay; first vet wellness visit; shots and boosters). About $100 to $500 pending on the veterinarian's prices. <br>  <br>  <br>  The price of ferrets vary - depending from where you obtain one - from an individual, adopt from a shelter or buy from a pet store. You can check Craigslists.org under pets in your city, Petfinder.com for adoptable pets or phone directory under Pet Stores. <br>  <br>  At pet stores, ferrets can cost $125 and more. I would recommend looking up ferret shelters where the adoption fees would be lower. In addition to obtaining the ferret, you need to consider: a LARGE cage, water bottle, food dishes, toys, sleeping hammock, litter/litter box, and food. Also, they love to play with other ferrets. <br>  <br>  When considering a ferret as a pet, you need to consider the cost of owning a ferret, not just the cost of buying a ferret. The financial responsibility can be costly to ensure the health of a ferrets. Ferrets need to be provided with a good quality ferret food, necessary vaccinations, and annual veterinarian visits for well care. A fund set aside for emergency medical care is highly recommended of at least $800 - $1000. Too many ferrets have died or relinquished to shelters, because the owner was unable to provide necessary medical care. <br>  <br>  Having ferrets myself, I know that the cost of a ferret can differ depending on which country you are in. . <br>  <br>  In America ferrets can range from $75-$250 but are generally about $100. <br>  <br>  I got my one of my ferrets at Petco. At Petco they cost about $129.95 <br>  <br>  i hope this information helps u !!
uNRygGS2aa	Hi<br>  <br>  Please please PLEASE don't get her a mate! A male would definatly mate with her. Baby chinchillas are very difficult, expensive, and time consuming to take care of. You might be able to get her a neutered male though. Fixing chins is very dangerous (especially females), so be sure to try and find a rescue chin who is already fixed.<br>  <br>  What are you talking about? Female chins can be housed together, as long as you introduce them slowly.<br>  <br>  How to indroduce them:<br>  1. Put their cages at least 1 foot apart. Let them get used to the sight, smell, etc. of each other. Don't be surprised if they start barking at each other!<br>  2. Gradually move the cages closer together.<br>  3. If all is going well, put the cages right next to each other! See what they do.<br>  4. Switch their cages. Ex. put chin A into chin Bs cage and chin B into chin As cage. This will allow them to get used to the smell of each other. Another good thing to do is to give the less-agressive one a dust bath and then give the other one the same dust bath.<br>  5. If all is well, introduce them in neutral territory. Let the more docile chin into the territory for about 5 minutes then bring out the more agressive/active one. Be sure to have a large area to introduce them in with many toys and hideing places!<br>  6. Let them play outside their cages together once a day for a couple weeks. They will get used to each other!<br>  7. Finally, house them together. Its a good idea to house them in the more docile chins cage, because the more agressive one will be very territorial if the other chin comes into her cage!<br>  8. Keep a close eye on them.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would have an experienced exotic vet check her out to make sure she isn't sick. Be sure to have them both checked out before you introduce them to make sure they dont have any illnesses/diseases that can pass on.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qQOyTxoQaa	Start out by putting the cages close enough together that they can see and smell each other but not close enough that they can bite or hurt each other. Leave them like this for a few weeks, if they warm up to each other, try letting them out of their cages and let them run around a Chin-proof room together for a little bit. Do this for a few days to a week or so and if you have no other problems then house them together.<br>  <br>  Before doing so, clean out the female's cage entirely so that her scent isn't in the cage. Then, put the male in for a couple of minutes then add the female. Be sure to watch them closely for a while to make sure that they don't go after each other.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2Go0Y0xnaa	Unless her father was castrated or she was spayed, I can't believe you left father and daughter together and had no problems.  Chinchillas don't know or care that they are father/daughter.  They breed just to breed.<br>  <br>  I second the previous poster's comment.  Do not get her a male.  You don't just buy a male as a companion unless you plan to deal with the outcome of breeding and offspring.  Doing this just for companionship is absolutely the wrong reason to put a nonaltered male and female together.  <br>  <br>  Who said you can't house two females together?  I have tons of females housed together.  I have two cages with 8 females in each of them, and they do great.  They are always in a huge chinnie pile up cuddling.  I house my males with other males and females with other females all the time.  <br>  <br>  The information given above is good, and I'd like to add to it.  As well as trying the side by side cages, etc., I personally prefer to do a smaller cage inside of a larger cage.  I use a chinchilla show cage, which you can purchase at this site:  <a href="http://www.ryersonchinchilla.com/arc_001.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.ryersonchinchilla.com/arc_001...</a>  I think they are around $7.00 plus shipping.  Place one chin (usually the more aggressive one) into the show cage, put some hay in there, and slip it into the cage of the chin you want to pair up with.  Leave her in there for several hours (or, even overnight, but do NOT forget she's in there and make sure she has a water supply).  Then, reverse the chins.  Put the other one in the cage, and let the caged one run free.  <br>  <br>  After you do this a couple times, try letting them out together.  Clean the cage you are going to put them in thoroughly, bleach and hot water, then leave it in the sun to dry.  Eliminate all traces of either chin's scent.  Clean the hammocks, houses, etc., the same way.  When you put the chins in together, put a dab of vanilla above their noses and around their tails to help block the "strange" smell.  Put in a dust bath, some hay, and plenty of chew toys to distract them and stand by.  See how it goes.  <br>  <br>  If there is one clear aggressor, try trimming her whiskers by about an inch in length, and try again.  If there is still fur flying, place the aggressor back into the show cage, and start over.  I have had more success with this method than any other I have ever tried when introducing chins.  They get a good chance to get used to each other, without risking their health.  <br>  <br>  If you'd like more information on chinchillas, their care, introductions, and anything else chinchilla, please join <a href="http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com.</a>
91CX5jHaaa	Please don't use cellphone text message gobbledegook here.  We educated folks who can appropriately answer your questions know how to use proper grammar and punctucation.<br>  <br>  To answer what I *think* your question is, no one says people shouldn't own pets.  Only that people should educate themselves about pet ownership before getting one.  Too many folks on here want to breed dogs and don't even know whether a female has to be in heat to be bred.  They don't know about nutritious foods and what ingredients in certain dog foods can be a big problem.  They get dogs because the puppies are "cuuuuute", and dump them when they don't know how to housetrain them.  They get bigger dogs and dump them because they can't them leash trained and they knock over the 9 month old baby.  <br>  <br>  Dogs are great animals and anyone who learns how to raise and train a good dog, and how to find a responsible breeder, or how to find a compatible shelter dog should get a dog if they want one.  But first, be sure you really want one for it's lifetime, and whether you can afford and know how to care for it properly.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Because, most of the people on here should not own dogs. <br>  <br>  They cannot afford the vet care<br>  <br>  They leave them outside all day to rot<br>  <br>  They let them run throughout the town/neighborhood<br>  <br>  They breed them "for fun" or "to make money"<br>  <br>  They leave them home all day with no supervision or care (8-10 hours)<br>  <br>  They buy from horrible sources<br>  <br>  They start hitting the dog and rubbing its nose in stuff because they didn't train it<br>  <br>  They refuse to train it in any fashion, thinking that a bad TV show makes up for actual training<br>  <br>  They dump their dogs at shelters because "They shed too much", "They pee on the carpet", "They have too much energy", "I got a new job", "My new boyfriend doesn't like dogs", etc.<br>  <br>  The queen can keep her dogs because she has a fleet of people who can care for them. Yes, money has something to do with it. <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with those with lower incomes owning dogs, as long as they properly care for them.  Someone with a savings account and pet insurance who takes care of their dog is a far better owner than a millionaire who is never home and ignores the dog.|`|KxjUim7yaa	People differ in the number of dogs they can properly care for. The queen most likely doesn't feed or pick up the poop from her dogs. I have 2 dogs. I can feed,care for and vet 2. Maybe someone can care for 5 or 6. They just have more energy than I do.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	I think people are opinionated! They have a right to be. Some people enjoy their pets in different ways. some dress them up and show them off, some hunt them, some show them, some do obedience. As long as you are enjoying your pet who cares what petless people think!|`|9dS4lyz6aa	what? I don't understand what you are saying everybody, at least mostly everybody, loves dogs on here.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	I think the members of this board give their honest opinions based on their experiences with dogs.  The simple truth is, it's not always a good time to own a dog and not everyone (at least in the way they present themselves here) is well equipped to care for one.  These people speak from their experience and advocate for the dogs.  As well they should.  Too many people see dogs as accessories or disposable items.  "They're lots of fun when they're cute little puppies, but I didn't bargain for this big, uncontrollable dog."  <br>  <br>  The truth is, dogs need more than food and water.  They need exercise, training (for their whole lives, not just at 4-6 months), and grooming.  They need time and commitment from their owners.  They need their owners to be financially secure enough that if the dog is ill or injured it will be brought to a vet.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  There are too many dogs (and cats) in shelters because of owners who thought they were cute at first but then decided they were too much work.  And if the members here can convince even one of these people that they are not ready for pet ownership, then it's well worth it.|`|FcnEpRvUaa	First, please try to write your question in English. I can barely understand what you wrote.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the amount of dogs should vary based solely on the person's ability to take care of them. Few people are able to take care of 3+ dogs emotionally and financially, others can do it easily and have a whole pack with no problem. It depends on what they know, if they can support the animals, and if they have the space.|`|cY4vg9VAaa	I don't think people are advocating to NOT have dogs but rather, if you want a dog, be sure you can afford it. Dogs, like kids, are expensive. Think about food, vet costs, vaccinations, checkups, ect. Plus, if you cannot afford to take your dog to the vet, in truth, you cannot afford to own one. What if it gets sick/injured? You cannot get it treated. Owning a dog is alot of responsibility that many people do not consider.They need nurture and training that some people aren't willing to provide.|`|A9sLvVDxaa	Dogs are a huge responsibility. The medium and large breeds require lots of exercise and space. But a lot of people who live in the city or in apartments don't get that taking the dog a few times around the block in the morning is not enough! Dogs need at least a backyard to run around in or a trip to a dog park several times a week. <br>  <br>  Also there is training, which is very important. What if your dog is aggressive towards people? Children? Other pets and animals? Are you going to wait until it attacks someone? There's also other important training to consider. And if the owner doesn't take the time to train their dog or hire a trainer early on, then you'll end up with an unruly monster.<br>  <br>  Dogs get restless and bored easily, especially when they're cooped up in a house all day. They can develop nervous habits, like chewing on things, peeing indoors, destroying the house.<br>  <br>  Yes, dogs can be very affectionate, loyal, lovable and protective. These are the reasons why so many people love dogs. But people don't think when adopting a dog. They need to look at their lifestyle and home environment.<br>  <br>  And if you ever suggest to a dog owner that they may not be serving their dog well, they get very defensive. Scratching him behind the ears and feeding him table scraps doesn't make you a good dog owner. In fact obesity in dogs is a serious problem and it begins when they learn that eating people food is okay. <br>  <br>  Having a pet is exactly like having a child, but most people don't make that connection. They don't realize how helpless these creatures are. They need constant love, attention and care...just like a young child.<br>  <br>  Dogs are wonderful, but people need to learn to take care of their dogs.
8i90ov0Gaa	Are you sure it was a cottonmouth? There are harmless water snakes which are extremely similar to cottonmouths and much, much more common. I have seen dozens and dozens of what people were calling cottonmouths, and every single time it turned out to be a blotched water snake or other harmless species. Also, despite what many people think, cottonmouths do not go around chasing people and looking for trouble.|`|EuJTvGkxaa	Nothing if you live by a river or some small source of water.|`|CUFnorZyaa	Clean up your rodent problem. <br>  <br>  Remove places snakes like to hide out. Scrap piles, etc.<br>  <br>  Keep the weeds pulled and grass cut.<br>  <br>  Basic things like that will discourage them. If they have no food and no shelter they'll look for somewhere else to hang out.

pYF9KnNeaa	I believe you are asking about Conures.  It is not a matter of one being better than the other.  Basically, a Conure is a Conure and it just depends on which type you like the looks of the best.  Some Conures will cuddle but don't count on it.  Most parrots will be cuddly and put up with more handling while they are young.  Very few enjoy it or will tolerate it after they are adults.  So if cuddling is high on your list, you need to consider another type of pet.  If you want to stay in that size group, you might consider researching a Caique.  Not that they are a bunch more cuddly but they are known to be very playful and clownish, is handled correctly.  Here is a link to help you get started.<br>  <a href="http://www.boaf.com/article_4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boaf.com/article_4.htm</a>   Good luck with this important decision.

A cardboard box with a hole in the side, or an overturned flower pot with a hole at the top or on the side, or one of the half-logs they sell at stores) on both ends (cool and warm)<br>  <br>  A heating pad // heat tape<br>  <br>  A large water bowl (large enough for the snake to fit most, if not all, of its body inside)<br>  <br>  <br>  This isn't REQUIRED, but my snakes like if I put some plastic vines with leaves (like the kinds they sell at craft stores) in the corner and wet them down a bit.<br>  <br>  If you choose newspaper as a bedding, you NEED a hide no matter what. If you choose Aspen, it isn't exactly required if you put enough for them to burrow in, but you really should as it will make them feel more secure. Also, you should put the hide directly above, or half-on-half-off the heating pad. You will need to put some repti-carpet or the likes above the heating pad to ensure the snake doesn't lay on the glass above it and get burned.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	A tank- depending on size and gender it varies. 30 gallons works for an adult male, 40 for an adult female. Make SURE it has a locking lid.<br>  <br>  Substrate- I use aspen, some use newspaper. You have a few options, but stay away from pine and cedar!<br>  <br>  Thermometer- you should get 2 of them, one for the hot side and one for the cool. <br>  <br>  Hydrometer-This is to measure humidity (40-50%) Boost it to 60 when it's shedding.<br>  <br>  Hides- Two is best, one for the hot side and one for the cool. I like using wooden hides because it helps when they shed. You can just use a cleaned out butter container with a cut dome shape.<br>  <br>  Heating supplies- that means a heating pad, lighting fixture and a bulb. That's just my personal needs. It depends on how big your tank is, whether it's a tub or tank and how warm your house is.<br>  <br>  Food of course is needed, and depends on the size of your snake. A water dish is needed too, and should be cleaned regularly. Also, stay away from heat rocks.|`|NvGqiA4vaa	an appropriately sized tank/terrarium (not a fish tank) -- 40 gal is good for an adult; a water dish large enough for them to soak in (doesn't have to be bigger than maybe 10 inches across); substrate (nothing with cedar in it, no sand) or 'carpeting', some people use newspapers too but make sure they're clean; a hiding spot (on each side of the tank, the cool side and warm side) that is large enough for them to fit into but small enough to make them feel secure inside of it, lots of people use the half-logs they sell at pet stores but a secret i learned is take a clay gardening pot, make a hole in the bottom and put it upside down in the tank, my ball python absolutely loves it; a heating pad (make sure there is something covering it on the inside of the tank so the snake cannot directly lay on the glass that it is underneath, the snake can get burned. i use a piece of the repti-carpet to cover that area, and put the clay pot on top of it, that way he can't burrow underneath it and when he goes inside his pot it's nice and warm for him); some people use heating lamps as well, it depends if you need extra heat for them, if you do use one make sure it isn't above the same spot as the heating pad, and turn it off at night so the snake can have the proper day/night cycling; a thermometer and humidity gauge, place them both in the upper center of the tank, don't place a lamp above them as that will give you the wrong readings; also a mister is a good idea as they need a fairly high amount of humidity (60 - 80%) for good health and to properly shed.<br>  <br>  hope this helped you and i hope you and your snake (if you get one) are very happy together! :)|`|xhZ0nFTYaa	Large vivs can make ball (or royal) pythons nervous.  They are a timid species and generally a viv that is one and a half to two-times the length of the snake is plenty.  They do not necessarily climb but some foliage and branches might be enriching for them as they do come out and investigate.  A hide that is snug for them to ball up in during the day, as in the wild they spend much time in animal burrows.  Under-tank heating and some form of radiation such as ceramic bulb or IR bulb also, as they still need heat overnight but you don't want a light on in the corner when you're trying to sleep!  A thermostat to control the heat mat/cable and the bulb or strip light/heater to regulate temperature.  Possibly a humidity monitor but to be hones a bit of condensation on the glass of the viv indicates enough moisture.  And finally a water bowl, mostly just to aid shedding.  You can use sphagnum moss to keep the viv moist too.  Make sure you have a cool end and a hot end in the viv so the python can regulate its own temperature if it needs to.<br>  They are great snakes and easy to look after once you get them eating.  Don't be too alarmed if they go a month or even two without feeding - especially females and also after a change of habitat.<br>  Good luck!|`|KY1rvB0haa	Well you will need at least a 20 gallon tank to start. A log or some type of item he can hind under, water dish, light heater, water sprayed is nice but not as important, thermometer for the tank.

It is less than Science Diet, Iams, Nutro and definitely less than the organic/high protein foods, but it still has chicken as its #1 ingredient. You can get it at Petsmart or most pet stores.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Ok well.  Most of the higher quality brands are more expensive.  But think of it this way.  They won't get as many health problems.  If they get a high quality diet.  So pay more for dog food get less Vet bills.  Also the dog doesn't have  to eat as much of the Good Dog Food because it fills them up faster.  So you have to feed less food than usually so it will last longer.  So in the long run.  Spending a little more money on dog food will acually save you money.  <br>  <br>  Don't ever get these foods.  Mostly Grocery Store Brands.<br>  Royal Canin<br>  Eukanuba<br>  Iams<br>  Science Diet<br>  Ol'Roy<br>  Pedigree<br>  Purina<br>  Beneful<br>  Kibble N Bits<br>  Just to name a few of the nasty brands.  So DON'T get any of these brands.<br>  <br>  Here are some good brands that are acually worth your money.  <br>  Wellness<br>  Wellness CORE<br>  Innova/EVO<br>  GO Natural<br>  Orijen<br>  Timberwolf Organics.<br>  So they are all good brands of dog food.<br>  <br>  When finding a new food.  Look at the ingredient list.  If they have by-products, corn, soy or even grains.  Don't get it.<br>  Also at least the first 2 ingredients should be meat.<br>  <br>  When switching foods.  To a higher quality one.  Switch over at least a 7 day period.<br>  <br>  Here's a website.  4 stars is good dog food.  5 stars is a great dog food.  And 6 stars is an excellent dog food.  Stars 1,2, and 3 are all low quality dog foods.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com</a><br>  <br>  Hopefully you will switch to one of the higher quality brands.  And remember in the long run it will acually save you money.  Because not as many vet bills.  And you also have to feed less of the higher quality brands.  And their is also less dog poop.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  And Good Luck finding a great brand of dog food!|`|tY14vbrKaa	Naturapet Innova EVO is a great quality food, but the prices are higher... (though similar to "quality" grocery store brands).<br>  <br>  Remember, a healthy diet, and a healthy pet is priceless.
dl1OOOT8aa	Anyone can call themselves a dog trainer there is no state license that you need to receive in order to be a trainer. Unless you are training hunting/bird dogs, then i believe there are certain licenses you must acquire by law. <br>  <br>  The only problem I see is that you are underage and have no liability insurance like a "professional trainer". BTW a lot of places who give "certifications" for dog training is just a crap shoot anyways, be careful where you go, a lot are just scams.  The best training advice I've ever gotten was a lawyer at my local schutzhund club.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I suppose you could consider yourself a hobby trainer.<br>  <br>  You still cant do it to make money tho, you need to be a professional and have a buisiness licence.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I'm a rocket scientist...<br>  <br>  It's not illegal to train dogs without qualifications... Just look at Cesar Millan (ugh).<br>  <br>  You would gain a lot more respect and business with qualifications though, as you won't experience every situation just in day-to-day life.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	your not a dog trainer unless you have the qualifications you see it as a hobby|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Well, no you aren't necesserally considered a "dog trainer" <br>  I can teach my dogs the basic commands, but that doesn't make me a dog trainer, you know? <br>  Just a pet owner teaching a dog a few tricks for fun, that's all. <br>  Dog trainers don't necesserally only teach dogs commands, they also help with behavioral issues. <br>  Haha NO, it's not illegal to call yourself a dog trainer. Call your self what ever you wish..|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	I think you've already gotten some pretty good advise. <br>  <br>  *Is it legal? Nope, because you are too young to enter into a contract. And dog training is a serious business with serious consequences if anything goes wrong.<br>  <br>  Keep doing what you are doing, and see if the shelter where you volunteer (or any other local shelter) has considered offering training classes. If so, you could work with an experienced adult trainer as an apprentice and learn more techniques from them.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Congratulations on being so ambitious!  Right now I would not call yourself a trainer.  Yes, you have shown the ability to teach a dog certain behaviors but that isn't enough.  You need to have experience working and training many different dogs in many different situations.  You are on the right track though.  In the shelter where you volunteer, is there a trainer who works with the dogs?  If so, I would ask to help this person work with the dogs.  You could also contact a local dog training facility and ask to assist the trainers with their classes.  A lot of training is training the people as well as their dogs.  Let's face it, you won't be living with the animal, the family does and they need to know how to train their animal.  You need to be able to communicate what you are doing and how to do things to the human half of the equation.  <br>  I would also look into 4-h to help you get an even better understanding of animal husbandry.  If you have your own dog, consider training it to competition level in obedience and agility and other sports.  This will further solidify you as a training with evidence of your accomplishments.  If you can train your dog to compete in a show ring, you will have proven you can handle some pretty complex behaviors.  Good luck!|`|YPSSVxwKaa	It depends on if you took classes or not if you took the classes and are certified as a dog trainer then yes but if you just think that you are great at it then no it just means that you are verily good and think someday if you take the classes then you can be a professional!!

IYd6bw7Gaa	I trust Oxbow, Sunseed and Kaytee.  All provide a balanced nutrition and don't require suppliments.  However, fresh fruits and veggies are always an appreciated treat!|`|wsLngQ8oaa	that's great, you're doing a great job in making sure your hammy gets it's nutrients|`|pWsbbQ7eaa	Yeah I had a hamster before (but it died like 3 days ago :(() and that's what I usually fed it.<br>  Try some hamster mix/food (you can get at your local pet store) and every 2 or 3 days add some vegetables. <br>  That diet looks great, but don't feed it too much vegetables. It needs to each some dried food as well.<br>  And not just vegetables, add some fruit! Maybe once a week or two, add some pieces of apples in there. My hammy used to love it.<br>  <br>  Take Care
eeaXYyCNaa	For the longest we thought that one of my birds, which was a cockateil, was a boy and it turned out it was a girl.  Only a vet can really tell you.  It is very possible that you got it wrong.  Also, they might both be boys.  We had a love bird that enjoyed doing that to another male.  The other one would get mad and start biting him.  It was funny to watch.|`|Pe0gITtiaa	I think its impossible for drinks to reproduce|`|b6kXDYnKaa	<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ycDcydJ9FHU/SUmm3MuB9fI/AAAAAAAAATI/I_dzQ8EQZZI/s320/birds-scary-****-demotivational-poster.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ycDcydJ9FHU/SU...</a>|`|hEnQRmIvaa	I'm with CrazyC
m1ypmbNKaa	Well, here is a list of things you can feed him that are safe, and are human foods:<br>  <br>  Apples<br>  Pears,<br>  peaches,<br>  bananas,<br>  berries,<br>  kiwi,<br>  pomegranate,<br>  grapes,<br>  raisins,<br>  carrots,<br>  sweet potatoes,<br>  beets,<br>  broccoli,<br>  legumes,<br>  frozen mixed vegetables,<br>  kale,<br>  greens (not lettuce),<br>  greenpeppers,<br>  zucchini and other squash,<br>  asparagus,<br>  ripe tomatoes,<br>  dried hot peppers,<br>  sprouts-bean or<br>  alfalfa,<br>  spinach, and<br>  brussels sprouts.<br>  Bean sprouts<br>  use red, green, and yellow Bell Peppers for this recipe. I cut the Bell Pepper into little rings, or circle, so it looks like "O". Make sure you take out all of the seeds, and make sure you wash it very well. Hang them around the cage, or put them in a bowl together and let your bird paly with them! They love to use them as necklaces, munch on them, and hold them on their food. This is a great, healthy, and very fun toy for your cockatiel!<br>  <br>  Fruits:<br>  Apples<br>  Pears<br>  Peaches<br>  Bananas<br>  Berries<br>  Kiwi<br>  Pomegranate<br>  Grapes<br>  <br>  Before feeding your parakeets any fruits or vegetables, clean well! Most store bought fruits/veggies have pesticides on them which can prove to be lethal to your bird.<br>  <br>  Veggies:<br>  Carrots<br>  Sweet Potatoes<br>  Broccoli<br>  Cauliflower<br>  Bell Peppers<br>  Beets<br>  Legumes<br>  Frozen Mixed Vegetables<br>  Kale<br>  Zucchini (and other squash)<br>  Asparagus<br>  Bean or Alfalfa Sprouts<br>  Spinach<br>  Brussels Sprouts<br>  <br>  Again, make sure you clean well! Pesticides are used on store-bought vegetables and plants and can kill your bird.<br>  <br>  Also, try cutting up the veggies or fruits into dices, long slices, or thin little strips. You can feed apple whole as long as you skin it. My birds love to shred apple! You can also feed them *plain* apple sauce! Also, make sure you remove the roots, pits, and seeds of the food you give them.<br>  <br>  Foods You Should NEVER Feed:<br>  <br>  Chocolate<br>  Avocado<br>  Sugary Foods<br>  Salty Foods<br>  Greasy Foods<br>  High Fat Content Foods<br>  Caffeine<br>  Soda<br>  Alcohol<br>  Pits/Seeds/Roots of Fruits/Veggies<br>  Candy<br>  Rhubarb<br>  <br>  Here is another list with more options:<br>  <br>  Greens: Kale, Bok choy, spinach, chard, mustard greens, radish, carrot tops, beet tops, dandelion greens (make sure they haven't been sprayed or collected near a roadway) and just about any other leafy green veggie.<br>  <br>  Veggies: Carrots, peas, zucchini, corn, squash, radishes, bell pepper, broccoli, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, chili peppers.<br>  <br>  Grains: Steamed rice (white, brown, wild) cooked pasta, whole wheat and multi-grain bread, popcorn (no butter), bran muffins, polenta, grits, cous cous, sprouted seeds and grains (quinoa, amaranth, millet, teff, kamut, spelt), oatmeal, all natural cereal.<br>  <br>  Proteins: Raw sunflower seed (small amounts), chicken, eggs, fish, small amounts of hard cheese such as Jack and cheddar, tofu, cooked beans (lentil, kidney, black, garbanzo, navy, white).<br>  <br>  Fruit: Apples (seeds removed), peaches, bananas, melons, mango, pomegranate, oranges, papaya, strawberries, plums, pears, berries, nectarines, cherries. (Please remove all pits from fruit.)|`|hjCEZQB2aa	Khoa said it all ;-)
sHTpXUScaa	Three dogs are a pack. Your dogs are fighting for a pack leadership because your female doesn't view you as the leader of the back but her. She fights because she corrects everyone. She bosses everyone and decides who is allowed to have attention, play, or not to play. She has established a rule and how other dogs should respect. <br>  <br>     I will not permit a dog to establish a rule or be the one to correct other pack members. I will be the one to correct everybody. You need to consult with a behaviorist to work on your pack issues. <br>  <br>   Honestly, if your female dog is actually mine, then I will keep her tethered and totally separated from other dogs until she finally realizes who is the pack leader. Re-introduce the other pack members in my own way. No "T" behaviors will be tolerable, no rude behaviors will be acceptable as well, and she has to learn that growling, snapping, and cold staring will not be tolerable either. You need to do some reading on Ed Frawley's pack structure.|`|d1APITmkaa	i have a german shepherd and she doesn't like other dogs. there are only 3 dogs that she likes and two of them are her brother and sister from the same litter. The other dog is a dog she's known since she was 8 weeks old. Maybe she is trying to protect you. that sucks though, you want your dogs to get along.|`|acNUsqB7aa	are they spayed? the females take dominance seriously and will continue to fight unless you give them some order
zqVDJxUIaa	Freshwater aquariums need a water turnover rate of about 4 times an hour (bare minimum), preferably, 7 or more. The Bio-Wheel is an excellent filter, and I currently have 3 of them on my largest tank. They are reliable and durable. The 150 would circulate approximately 7.5 times your tank's volume, so that would be perfect. (the filter will always decrease in out put as the media gets clogged). <br>  <br>  While you have the new filter running, I'd recommend that you get your old filter media and place it in the tank, so that the beneficial bacteria can transfer to the new filter ,avoiding  a mini-cycle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|wu65ibG6aa	yes that would work just fine but always keep in mind the more filtration the better,too little or just barely enough can only lead to problems, so if you have the money to spend get the best filter you can, penguin bio wheels in my experience are great filters . and dont let anyone tell you your tank is overstocked.. general rule is 1 inch of fish per gallon of water but increasing the filtration increases the amount of fish the tank can hold. its about the bio load of the tank and how territorial the fish are , not the number of them..to an extent that is...
zqVDJxUIaa	Try and persuade her to let you get a fish. Here are some good points:<br>  <br>  -Fish don't require TOO much attention, though they do need some dedication<br>  <br>  -Scientists have proven that watching an aquarium will prevent and reduce stress<br>  <br>  -Having a fish aquarium will always give visitors a nice thing to look at<br>  <br>  Your mom seems a bit strict... just keep asking, maybe when she's really happy (like after her paycheck), and she'll eventually give in, unless she is the type of person who doesn't care about what others think (stubborn)<br>  <br>  Good Luck! I'm sure that you can bring out your mom's good side. You might want to get her a little gift...(bribe), Haha...<br>  <br>  Oh... P.S. Not to be mean, but  13 really isn't that old. My neighbor has a kid who's 13, and he tries to shoot down squirrels in trees with his water pistol...and never succeeds, of course.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	She prolly thinks that she's going to get stuck taking care of it.  That is the usual parental reason.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	I have always had fish since I was a little girl my mom always used to let me have them whenever they died I would get another but we have 7 animals now and I had to give my fish to my friend because he lived in this small bowl that used to be a cookie jar and wouldnt grow and my mom said that would be the last fish I would get! I am so p.o I really want one!! but looks like I am going to have to wait till im 18 haha (3 more years!)|`|19fa39a2ed4e38229aee162e273509bcaa	if you could buy it your self then go and buy it... and hide it in your room if it dies within a week then your mom was right...|`|FDgarm4Zaa	i dont get your question.|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Well that's just life, unfair and can't do anything about it since your young. While growing up my parents wouldn't ever let me keep a dog no matter how hard i tried, so i just gave up on it since i tried for at least 10 years but now i can have whatever i want since i live in my own place. <br>  <br>  Some parents are just like that, nothing you can do can change their mind just have to deal with it till you are older.<br>  <br>  But note that fish keeping isn't really as simple as people think it's actually pretty challenging and requires you to spend some money to care for them, maybe that's what your parents fear.<br>  <br>  Fish will never be happy or live as long as they should in a bowl to begin with. Most people think it's ok but it's really not because the most common fish that are kept in bowls are goldfish which is very bad because they can get up to 12 inches sometimes even bigger.<br>  <br>  You might have heard people say that fish will grow according to their living space but that's not true at all. Their growth will be stunned meaning you will not see them grow but their organs and intestines still continues to grow and they will die since their body didn't get enough room to grow as the inside is growing.<br>  <br>  All fish should also have a filter that helps cleans the water because fish releases toxic gas in the water called ammonia which is also caused by fish waste and waste of food, therefor a filter will be needed to filter out these thing, also weekly water changes. And tank/aquariums should be cycled before it's 100% safe for fish to live in there.<br>  <br>  Most important thing is that fish can not just live in plain water, they will die unless you treat their water with water conditioner and other good bacterias.<br>  <br>  See people think that you just have to have a bowl, fill it water, stick fish in there and feed the fish, so you now know fish keeping isn't that simple.<br>  <br>  Please know that i am not trying to be on your mom's side nor discourage you but i want you to know the truth, do lots of research on keeping fish and maybe once you get older maybe around 16 or 17 try asking your mom again or ask one of your family member to get you an aquarium for one of your birthday, that way you might be lucky and mom will let you keep it<br>  <br>  Know that if she does let you keep it you have to do your absolute best with raising fish; so start doing lots of research.<br>  <br>  Take care i hope you don't think i am a bad person and take the advice the wrong way.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Additional: see i can pretty much bet that it's the type of people who think they know about fish but really doesn't know anything that gave me thumbs down, while people with knowledge gave a thumb up.|`|dwA4bwlraa	Ha lol sucks for you im 12 and i have 29 gallon and a 10 gallon i've had no fish die except one because i was very new to it and i didn't acclimate it the best i could have. But try to get her to learn about having fish they're not to hard depending on the fish you get but please please please if she does let you get fish educate yourself because i guarantee if you would have got that goldfish you would have bought him a bowl which for a 12 inch fish sucks.|`|wu65ibG6aa	your mother doesnt want you to have a pet. either she thinks your irresponsible and it will just die, she thinks shell end up taking care of it. or any one of the reasons you posted she told you... but if you took care of your tank it wouldnt smell at all and how could u smell a goldfish through galons of water and glass?|`|fw925sTLaa	that's what my mom said about my betta ...eventually i got it for a birthday present (he he he he he he ) :d anyways so eventual she gave up and and since I was bugging her to much of course she said yes....but this is the only thing i can think you need to do with your om  tell her in till she gets paranoid if that doesn't work....IDk <br>  <br>  but hope this works ! :)|`|jnzSz3tRaa	ok so whats your question?|`|pwXe2OH6aa	idk im 16 and like i overfead my fish and it died within a week!!|`|5oQbDhl2aa	i'm in the exact same situation! i thought about sneaking out and buying the fish..but it's not worth getting grounded :(

zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, Java Moss provides an excellent hiding spot for fry, because it is so dense, that only the fry can swim through, being protected from the other hungry fish. Other fine-leafed plants work as well. However, since there is always the possibility of bigger fish reaching the fry, I wouldn't tank the fry from the separate aquarium(if you have one) until they are at least 1/2", or big enough so that they can't fit into the other fishes' mouths.<br>  <br>  P.S. Bling Bling has a good point, people who copy others are in fact, ignorant. So there you go!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Most definitely, but know that it doesn't mean that the fry will not be eaten by the other fish, the best thing to do is to buy them a 5 gallon tank (minimum) for themselves if you want them to survive and be as healthy as they should. They will mostly be hiding scared behind the moss and will not get to eat or swim as much as they should to obtain optimal growth, while some fry will make it most will not because they will be intimidated by the size of the adults. Please consider getting them there own tank, but the moss will do for now.<br>  <br>  PS. I find it so ignorant when one person copies the same answer as another, just makes no sense...Grow up people!!!<br>  <br>  Anyways take care and enjoy them cause fish are tons of fun.

stl7qP4Jaa	I will make this simple for you.<br>  <br>  1. Welcome to the Jumpers :)<br>  <br>  2. Depending on the level, yes, there is a potential for your round to be timed. When youre just starting out though in lower levels, its usually not timed and placings are normally just based on faults for knocking rails.  However Jumpers are typically Time Faulted and Rail Faulted.<br>  <br>  3. What do you do? Well, typically if youre familiar with hunters then you have an idea that you follow a course that is pre-designed for you. In Jumpers however, the course is laid out in a little more complicated manor.  Generally you require Triple Combinations, Double Combinations, Roll Backs. Aside from that, the fences are brighter and more challenging. Red and Whites / Planks / Multi-Colored Oxers / Wing Jumps etc.  There are also jump offs in the Jumper Ring.  Top few people take part in a jump off of an even more difficult course and the objective is to jump clear (no faults - time OR rails)<br>  <br>  4. What do you wear? The same as in hunters. However! Alot more leiniency is given in attire in jumpers.  Usually jumper riders go all out for color for their horses and saddle pads, boots/wraps etc.  Other accessories such as certain bits and martingales are acceptable.  And you - Black Boots, Beige Breeches, Shirt, Jacket (Black and Navy are most common), Gloves and of course your Helmet (ASTM Approved).  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!! Its definatley abreiviated but figured Id keep it simple.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Enjoy The Jumpers! You'll have a BLAST! :)|`|l9BcEysmaa	There will be a course of jumps that you have to jump in a certain time. If you knock down a fence, you get 4 penalty points. If you refuse a fence you get 4 penalty points and if you have 2 refusals, you are eliminated. If you fall off, you are immediately eliminated.<br>  <br>  You have to wear a riding hat, tall boots (preferably black), breeches (usually white, tan, or beige), and depending on the event, shirt, tie and jacket!!|`|QTT9380Yaa	Jumper classes are timed and all that matters is going fast and not getting any faults. Faults include: knocking rails with front or back hooves, refusals, falls, and skipping a jump. What you wear: breeches, tall boots, any collared shirt, gloves, helmet. How it works: when it is your round then give you a bell or alarm telling you its ok to start. Within 45 seconds (time varies at different places) of the bell you need to get to the first jump in your course. Your time starts when you pass the clock in front of the first jump. You want to go as faqst as you can and take the shortest route to your next jump. If you go clear it means you had no faults. The winner is decide by the fastest time and least amount of faults.|`|JFuVm9k5aa	hunters is based off the horse and the execution over the fences and on the flat. how it carries itself, how it behaves and how it moves and jumps. your supposed to be in control but seem like your doing nothing to get your horse to get a perfect round. it is not timed and there are no real faults for knocking a pole (it is not an good if there is a perfect round but it is not detrimental to your rounds success) <br>  <br>  in jumpers there is two parts. the first part is based on your time (you need to make time but it is not as fast as a jump off which is part two) you need to get around the course in the designated time and you need to go clear. which means no time faults or rails. if you pass in time with no poles down you go to a jump off where time is everything. you need to go clear (no poles) and go as fast as possible w/o having rails or hurting yourself or the horse. boots are allowed on the horse and you dont have to wear a coat unless showing at larger shows or going international. people usually try to take a shorter route to the jumps to help with time unlike hunters where going deep into the corners and keeping an even pace is important. a fall is immideate elimination and one refusal is 4 points 2 is elimination. i believe a pole knocked is four and time faults vary by level and time over <br>  <br>  example: instead of jumping an outside line then going to the corner and going to the inside line in a hunter course...a jumper would almost immideatly turn to avoid the corner and the extra steps...espically in a speed round/jump off.<br>  <br>  EDIT: whoever gave me thubmbs down is really ignorant :) the answer is correct. i show/have shown  internationally in both hunters (open hunter ar WEF, devon, indigo circuit, etc) and jumpers (german friendships 07' 08', WEF devon and indigo circuit as well)<br>  <br>  I kind of know my sh*t :) thanks!|`|BI1GbIZUaa	It is based on speed with faults for refusals, poles knocked down. There are also classes that are different. Power and speed has two parts to a course. The first part you are not timed. If you successfully clear the jumps with no faults then you go straight to the speed portion which is judged on time. If you have a fault during the power part you do not jump the speed umps, you leave the ring. Good luck! Jumpers can be lots of fun.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	of course you will jump<br>  yes, jumper classes are timed (unlike hunter classes)<br>  more than likely you will either trot or canter the course.<br>  you should wear show clothes of course.<br>  :]<br>  <br>  if you really want to know more about it buy a book about show jumping or ask another rider (maybe your instructor if you have one)|`|6EP7ILr3aa	Maybe you should rephrase your question.  Yes jumping classes are timed and you get penaltys if you knock a fence down. You wear the same things as you do with hunting. Kind of simple, you should get a book or a trainer.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	it will most likely be timed. they judge you on faults, your leads, style. you wear normal hunter jumper attire. tall boots,breeches, hunt coat, helmot ect
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Well being a fish specialist, i hope your tank is big enough for the gold fish since most of them can get pretty huge.<br>  Now the chasing is can be for several reasons including:<br>  <br>  SPACE: <br>  Goldfish need their space! Many people are not aware that a single goldfish needs at least 10 gallons of water (some varieties need up to 20).  Overcrowding in the tank is primary reason goldfish chase one another! Some are of the opinion that goldfish are “schooling” fish, however, this is not true. Goldfish will tolerate other goldfish and this should not be confused with schooling. Goldfish are “social” fish and do prefer the company of other goldfish, but one must be very careful to keep their fish in properly sized tanks to avoid one fish chasing the other/s.<br>  <br>  MATING:<br>  Mating behavior can involve a male fish chasing a female, however, to induce this behavior in a tank involves raising and lowering the temperature in the tank. It’s also fairly difficult to distinguish between male and female goldfish, so it’s going to be fairly difficult to tell you if you have a male chasing a female. If you have stumbled across the temperature fluctuations required to induce this behavior AND if you have a male/female combination its “possible” this is why your fish are chasing but it's not very clear. To be on the safe side remove the attacked fish and place him elsewhere by hims/herself for about a weekor so, then try to re-introduce him/her back into the tank, if nothing changes just take it back to the store and explain what happen and i am sure that they will give you a refund on it.|`|AA11901352	The older fish is just letting the new fish know who is top dog.  This will settle down.  Simply adding one fish especially a goldfish won't start a mating behavior right away.  <br>  <br>  If you do have a female and a male, the female needs to be mature between 2-3 years of age.  It will take her at the minimum of 1 week to come into eggs.  At that time, the male will chase the female bumping her side trying to get her to release her eggs.<br>  <br>  they are just getting to know each other right now.  Unless it continues and gets more violent there is nothing to worry about.  It will settle down.<br>  <br>  Also just an FYI when you purchase new fish you need to float the bag in the aquarium for a minimum of 15 minutes.  This will adjust the water temperature in the bag.  Open the bag and pour 1/2-1 cup of your tank water into the bag.  Allow it to float for another 15 minutes.  This will start the acclalimation of the PH.  Add another 1/2-1 cup of water to the bag and allow it to sit another 15 minutes.  This will continue to help the new fish acclimate to the tank water.  One more time and then you can release your fish.  Although goldies are a hearty bunch, other types of fish are not.  Just thought you might like to kjnow.|`|D75rqaihaa	I have 5 goldfish all different sizes some really big and some tiny, and they never fight, ive seen males chase female goldfish during mating for days and days, sometimes to the extent that the females are so exhausted they die, so people think ahhhh there fighting, but infact its just rough mating lol, you will especially see this in ponds, but still they may be fighting, look at your goldfish, and if one has white spots on its gills it will be the male and it will be wanting to mate, if not seperate them<br>  <br>  good luck|`|le0LsiVUaa	My fish were awful!<br>  I gace them to my friend <br>  they used to figggght all the time!<br>  Watch out for the bigger one they always try and intimidate the smaller one. =] <br>  ps sounds like they're mating but they could be sexing;) xx|`|SGwxaTIGaa	Souds like they are fighting it's unlike goldfish to act aggressive when looking for a mate.|`|7aEuyKVxaa	you mean the rs a difference|`|5zU3PqZraa	It is also very rare for goldfish to spawn in aquariums. I would think they are fighting, but I'v never know a goldfish that was very agressive, they will most likely settle down in a bit.
vgWqUcobaa	Here is a pretty good site for checking the gender of your mice:<br>  <a href="http://www.thefunmouse.com/info/sexing.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefunmouse.com/info/sexing.c...</a><br>  complete with pictures :).<br>  <br>  If her tummy is swelling, she may very well be pregnant.  Just like with people, some mice burgeon with babies, swelling to look like they swallowed a small baseball while others look like they swallowed a shooter marble.  Especially if she is young, the litter could be quite small.<br>  <br>  I would not separate her from her friend as long as they are not fighting.  Mice are communal animals and help each other take care of their babies.  Even does (female mice) without babies of their own can lactate and help care for another's babies!  It is pretty interesting to watch!  I usually try to leave the girls from a first litter with mom during a second litter as it helps them learn how to take care of their own babies better when they are moms.<br>  <br>  Be sure to separate the males when they are between 4-5 weeks of age, though as they can get mom or Jelly pregnant again even at that young age!|`|YvWpH3uXaa	definitely separate the two, Jelly might hurt the babies or freak Peanut out enough that she hurts them her self. <br>  the people on the funmouse forum can probably help you a lot better that i can, but she does sound preggers.<br>  good luck!|`|tDP6ru3oaa	Sounds like Peanut is pregant. I don't think Jelly would hurt the babies but it is a good Idea to seperate them. Just in case she gets in the way.

iiNAJfGCaa	First, you need to consider your friends welfare. Her horse may be doing this out of pain, but it is very dangerous behavior. I agree with everyone that a vet check is in order, however horses (even those in pain) do not generally go around bucking and rearing unless they are in EXTREME pain and this is usually very noticeable. It sounds like this horse may just be a little too much for your friend... seven years old is still relatively young. How long has she owned this horse and how much training has he had? If possible, have a trainer come in an evaluate this horse's suitability. I know that your friend loves her horse, but if he continues this behavior she is going to end up seriously injured.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	Bucking in its self can be attributed to the horse simply being fresh. But that would probably only be occasional and easy to diagnose. But if bucking is accompanied with rearing then it often means pain of some form.<br>  <br>  Does he have on his normal riding tack when he is being lunged?<br>  (I will elaborate further after I know the answer to this question)|`|BIR9olyxaa	First- check for a physical reason the horse would be in pain (back injury, bad saddle). If not, this horse sounds like he has no respect for his rider. She should go back to groundwork with him until he does. There are a lot of articles on the internet about how to earn respect on the ground.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	VET CHECK first. Right away. It seems that a lot of physical action bothers him.<br>  <br>  If he passes, however, you need to hire a trainer. If your friend was older and more experienced, I would give her training exercises and advice. But she is still too young and inexperienced to handle this on her own.<br>  <br>  If she needs help finding a trainer, let me know.|`|1uR2zPnEaa	if you rule out all pain issues why not have someone more experienced try riding him? thats what we did with my horse and he was perfect! so i took more riding lessons and now me and my horse are perfect together! =)|`|d6gE2XQ0aa	I'd make sure the saddle fits first. Only because you wouldn't want to spend the money on a vet check which most people reccomend. When longing pull his head to one side then the other, this is the most important form of flexing. If he doesn't get better go to the vet and if that doesn't help try a message.|`|YvMLFAkcaa	put a stronger bit on him  <br>  have a vet check him over he might have a sore mucle on his back<br>  she should just keep trying to improve him keep riding him<br>  dresage crop|`|RloOJ43haa	Step 1 - vet check to look for physical problems<br>  Step 2- if horse passes Step 1, call in a trainer. These issues are very dangerous and should not be left up to a 12 year old to solve.
5PsKGss7aa	It really depends on the vet for xrays.

Meat is the first product, and sometimes the second and third product. <br>  <br>  they're natural, and don't have unnecessary fillers like Corn, Soy and wheat/gluten that can cause skin allergies and gastrial problems<br>  <br>  they are also sans-by products which are just useless fillers.<br>  <br>  if you're switching from a low quality brand like puppy chow or store bought science diet or beneful... do a slow switch or you'll get a doggy with diarrhea.

vgWqUcobaa	Syrian hamsters are solitary animals.  Not getting along is not a matter of cage space, but species trait.  In extremely rare cases people have managed to keep hamsters together, but 9 and a half times out of ten they'll seem to get along fine and one morning their owner wakens to find one dead.  It is not a pretty thing :(<br>  <br>  If you want to keep one of the babies, you will need to get it another cage.  It's the only way you can guarantee the safety of both pets.<br>  <br>  As a side note, make sure you remove the babies from momma at 5 weeks.  It is not common, but is possible for a hamster as young as that to get mom preggers.|`|wsLngQ8oaa	I really wouldn't. Chances are they'd kill eachother|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	The mother killing  the babies is mercy killing and only happens when she feels they are weak or in danger.  It doesn't always happen.  They can stay with her for about 6-8 weeks.  at the point it will probably get too crowded.  Once mature these hamsters are solitary and cant live together.  They will fight and one or both could end up dying from injuries.  If you plan to keep one, you need to plan on a second cage.  The dwarf breeds of hamsters can live together, jsut not the syrian, which is what you have.|`|YvWpH3uXaa	'silky hamster' is just a fancy name that pet stores tack on for syrian hamsters( a better name would be silky syrian hamster). they are lone creatures and responsible breeders only put the males and females together for a short time for breeding. after the babies hit 12+ weeks keeping them with mom of each other is going to be asking for trouble.
7HxJvbjMaa	Cats like to wander. And the fact that he hasn't come home in 4 days tells me that somebody took him in and is feeding him.

zqVDJxUIaa	You haven't cycled your tank yet. This cloudiness is due to high ammonia levels. Ammonia is a poisonous chemical that can kill the fish. It is excreted from fish waste, decomposing plants, etc. <br>  <br>  Many people have no idea what cycling is, they simply think that fish are as easy as 'Just add water and voila!' <br>  <br>  I will explain the cycling process for you:<br>  <br>  "Cycling the tank" means that you are establishing a bacteria bed in your biological filter to remove the toxins that the fish's metabolism creates. There are right and wrong ways to do this, and several things you can do to slow this process (which you don't want to do). There are two steps to cycling, but you don't have to do anything special for either of them. First, your filter will grow a culture of bacteria that digest ammonia and turn it into Nitrite (which is more toxic than the ammonia in hard water or water with a higher pH), then your filter produces bacteria that digest Nitrite and turn it into relatively harmless Nitrate. However, Nitrate will contribute to loss of appetite and stress in your fish, as well as contributing to algae growth, so it is important to do regular small water changes to keep your tank in best condition.<br>  <br>  Steps to solve the problem:<br>  1. Don't add any more fish!<br>  2. Perform 20-30% water changes every two days<br>  3. Remember to condition the water using a chlorine neutralizer such<br>  as Aqua Plus (Nutrafin).<br>  4. Vacuum the gravel using a gravel siphon<br>  5. Optional* Use Cycle, a product by Hagen, which establishes<br>  beneficial bacteria into your aquarium.<br>  <br>  Do these steps, and the water will return clear after a few days.<br>  <br>  For more cycling info: IMPORTANT!:<br>  <a href="http://www.bluecrayfish.com/cycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluecrayfish.com/cycle.htm</a><br>  <br>  DON"T ADD ANY MORE FISH UNTIL YOU"VE FINISHED CYCLING!<br>  Good Luck!|`|2E2hHlCgaa	you probably need to redo everything....... tonight.. put out some water so tomorrow morning you already have good water and room tempature for your lil' fishes........<br>  <br>  make sure you re-rince your rocks your decoration and filters and your tank... redo your tank... and set up water for a few hours and throw in some medication to your fish tank such as salt.. ick protection and slime if you have any... and now you can put your fishes back in there.. :) make sure the water has setted for a few hours before you put the fishes back in...........|`|nHp8zzkjaa	Ok check the water temp they have a heater<br>  water can be cloudy if the filter was not rinsed or is not clean<br>  do u treat the water with declorinator before you put it in?<br>  Also some times the fish are sick when you buy them even if they do not show signs at first. Don;t buy from stores that use centralized filtration.|`|EvtbitGtaa	They are probably dying because Tropical fish need to inhale water that has a warm temp the tank looks cloudy because the heat is to high so the water is condensing on the glass which makes the tank look foggy. Or the water heater is not clean enough so the water is coming out warmer. So if you let the heater take a break it wont store carbondioxide which makes the tank hotter

x0WZE0i4aa	My rule of thumb when it comes to older cats is never to assume it's 'just age'.  I learnt that when my 11 year old started looking 'old' and then skinny.  Thankfully I took her to the vet and she's still alive at just about 19!<br>  <br>  Seriously, if you can't see any reason for this change in her, it would be a good idea to pop her along to the vet for a check up.  Yes it could be just age.  It could also be she's not grooming properly because of illness, or an illness is actually causing the change in her coat.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Nothing.|`|4c2f3QU6aa	Don't dress her in black and don't take her to a fancy restruant

1WmDOPGtaa	Technically, since it was a gift, the dog is hers should they break up.  But don't expect that to go over well with the boyfriend.  This is exactly the reason that puppies should not be given as presents. By anyone... not to mention hormonal and emotionally immature children (please understand I don't say that to slam your daughter, it's just the reality of being a teenager).  Take this opportunity to teach your daughter the value of this living, breathing animal.  Help her understand why it is best to purchase a pet in a well thought out and thoroughly planned fashion.  And while you're at it, go ahead and let her know it's much more simple with a puppy than a baby.  Good luck!  I hope this turns out well for all involved.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Wow I cant believe that kid did that. He needs to know that this pup doesnt constitute a contract of love. She should never of encouraged or accepted this dog right? This is just so sad, I cant believe that smeone that age would be so...........stupid to do somthing like this. Poor guy. If she breaks up with him, she should offer the dog back under these circumstances, so that he may keep or sell it. Wow, this kid will be ruined if she breaks up and this dog becomes a huge issue. Thats really sad, things like this can ruin a very nice guy I think youd agree.  Gifts for this age group shouldnt exceed five bucks, I mean they are children not adults with jobs.|`|Bw18seFqaa	she is not obligated to stay with him just because he bought her a puppy.. it was a stupid move on his part to spend so much money on someone that he hasnt been dating for very long.<br>  <br>  <br>  She is not obligated to return the puppy either..  it was a gift, and is legally hers (well, technically, since she's under 18, the puppy is yours).|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes she can break up with him.

They break up..|`|nSev0G2Haa	of course she can still break up with him.  Hopefully they last, if they're happy.  If they do split up, hopefully they'll remain friends so they can both enjoy the dog.  But he bought it for her, so it is just like any other gift - it now belongs to her.  You and your daughter should have no reason to feel badly, because it was his choice to make.  If he wanted a dog so badly he should have gotten one for himself.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	This guy sounds a little weird. First, he didn't even mention that he was getting a puppy for your daughter to you. Second, who the hell buys a puppy at 15 for a girlfriend? From a guy's point of view, this boy is going to use that puppy as a leverage. I.E. he can threaten to take the puppy away if she breaks up with him and she might feel obligated to him.|`|K0H7bAR8aa	I wouldn't break up with him a month or two.

I don't think I'd allow my child to accept a $600 gift from anyone.
RGQJfaCKaa	Leave the bird alone for a while, like two days then tame it. He's probably really scared. Here's a good way to tame your bird.<br>  <br>  Ok the first thing that you need to do is to give the bird space and time to adjust to it's new home. Do not put your hand in the cage right away as this will probably scare him. Give him a few days to adjust, but after the first two days you can begin to put your hand in the cage, but don't approach the bird. Let it come to you as this will build trust between you and the bird. After a few days of this you can begin to offer the bird food from your hand. Seeds usually do the trick. Eventually the bird will not be as afraid of your hand. Once this is accomplished you can place your finger in front of the bird's lower chest and very slightly push up while saying "step up". However DO NOT push up below the keel as you could puncture the bird's organs. The keel is the bone that runs up the middle of the bird's chest. The bird will either put one foot or both feet on your finger. If the bird only puts one foot on your finger, try it again as the bird s probably testing your finger to make sure it is safe. Do this a few times a day for about a week.<br>  <br>  After that if you want to take the bird out of his cage, take the cage to a safe room (no shelves, sharp objects, fans, plants, mirrors or windows, or cover up windows and mirrors). Make sure the doors are closed. Then you can take the bird out of his cage on your finger. It is important to do this in a darker room as the bird will be less tempted to fly. When doing this it is best that the bird has had it's wings clipped as it can't gain lift to fly. If the bird does fly do not try to stop it. Wait for it to land then use a very light towel "duster" and place the towel over the bird. Cup your hands around the bird loosely and place it in it's cage. As the bird learns to fly it will begin to fly back to it's cage to land. It is important for the bird to learn that it's cage is a safe place to land. That will make having the bird flying around a lot easier. Keep practicing this until the bird will willingly sit on your finger outside of the cage.<br>  <br>  Then you can begin to teach your new bird some tricks. This is how I trained all of my birds and it worked really well.|`|VdeV0jUqaa	Its normal for a bird to act a little different when it first arrives at a new home.<br>  It is a big change for a bird- moving from the place that they know, and the people and birds they are friends with to find themselves in a strange new setting.<br>  If he doesnt eat over the next couple of days then I would take him back to the store for advice- In the meantime, though, try to take it easy with him and help him get settled into his new home.<br>  Has he got anywhere in the cage to retreat to if he gets nervous? Its a good idea to partially cover the cage over the first couple of days so he can hide from you while he is still uncomfortable with you.<br>  Does he have any toys to play with in the cage? 'Tiels are clever birds and they need some environmental enrichment.<br>  If you can- have the bird in the loungeroom or somewhere else that people frequent, and try to eat your meals in front of your bird- parrots always seem to eat together- it helps you to bond and they will feel more comfortable. When he is a bit braver you can even try to give him some of your food.<br>  Birds also like to be able to see you sleep- so if you put hi in your bedroom at night you may also help to build the trust. As long as you dont mind a loud wake up!<br>  The birds poo sounds like its normal enough colour.<br>  Its a good idea to get some books on Cockatiels and Parrot Behaviour and Training so you can learn how to bond with your bird better- good luck!|`|fzDqXTPDaa	Maybe it will fall of its perch and go all stiff soon|`|C4ibOR7Laa	how long have you had him?<br>  maybe hes nervous, doesnt know whats going on or where he is, maybe hes lonley? try taking him out and stroking him gently, feed him a treat maybe|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Did you just get this bird?  If he's really not eating, you can take the perches out of the cage and put food on the floor.   You could put water in a jar lid on the floor, too.  Then he's there on the floor with the food and water and may get the idea to eat.
H06PtiIAaa	ok before replacing have you cleaned the inside, and if there are air bubbles comming out it is because it is running dry.<br>  <br>  Basically all biocubes do this, the filter pad is slowing down the water too much, so either rince it well or replace it.<br>  <br>  Also i would wash out the blue sponge right before the pump as that can hold alot of dirt as well.<br>  <br>  Then if not add more water.<br>  <br>  But if you want to replace the pump, try via aqua water pumps. they tend to be the best.<br>  <br>  owner of the BC 29 and BC 14

DxVUnmZQaa	If this is your first time . either bring it to the vet or the groomer's to have it cut and they'll teach you . it doesnt cost much . <br>  but if you prefer to cut it yourself . you have to got a rabbit nail cliper . please dont use those ordinary human nail clipers . <br>  it cost pain for your poor furball . <br>  <br>  there are many ways to cut your bunny's nails . you could try the burrito way . most used if your bunny kicks alot . <br>  the burrito way is simple . you'll have to wrap your bunny in a towel . place it on your lap wirth it back facing you , just like a lying down bunny  .comforting it face to face . after that you could try to stick out a paw one by one slowly and cut it . <br>  <br>  be sure you cut it right . because if you cut it wrongly . bleeding may occur . there'll be a light pink section in your bunny's nails , thats the quik , when your cutting . be sure to leave about 0.3 cm of white coloured-nail behind to make sure safety 1st :D btw your not suppose to cut the quik :D its just like our nails . pink and white . who on earth cuts the pink part of our nails ? only some weirdos does it :D<br>  <br>  when your holding on to your bunny's paw . you can also try comforting it by adding a little pressure  [ not too hard ] onto his paw and rubbing it gently . it kinda eases the rabbit's fear . <br>  <br>  next if your bunny is not that aggressive and very tame :D <br>  you just have to sit next to the bunny , place his two paws on your lap and cutting the nails one by one . <br>  simple :D be sure that an allowance of 0.3 cm of white coloured nail is left behind before it touches the pink coloured , <br>  <br>  but its best for your bunny to have a vet or groomer to trim it first , as they are professionals . <br>  so that it ensures the bunny that if they are going to have another nail cutting session . they would be a bit more relaxed than having it cutting the bunny's nails all by yourself without experience . <br>  it would leave fear behind :D <br>  <br>  besides they'll teach you how to cut . its worth it :D|`|DryvhGJyaa	I do my at home you just cut them until you get close to the pink part of the nail. Be sure not to cut the pink part of the nail. Or if you don't feel comfortable cutting them yourself you can take them to a pet store and they will probably cut them for you.

Rx7wv4JLaa	For the cat food you will ahve to hide it or put it up. Cat food smells and sometimes taste better then their own food. <br>  <br>  For the potty training<br>  <br>  Do you plan on litter training your pup or teaching him to go outside? <br>  <br>  If you are to train him to go in a litter box or outside i'd start doing so now and get rid of the puppy pads. They will only confuse him. Puppy pads are great for situations where you are gone to work during the day and no one can let him out. Or in litter box training you can use the pads instead of gravel litter, I find the pads are safer. <br>  <br>  How old is the puppy? its very normal for a 2,3 or even 4 month old puppy to not fully understand where they need to go. Most dogs are not fully house trained until 6-8 months old. This is b/c their bladders are growing and they need to learn how to hold their urine and b/c their bladders at this point are pretty small. The rule of thumb is a puppy should be going out how many months old they are in hours...so 3 months old, every 3 hours. <br>  <br>  Had you been encouraging him to go on the pads? If not that could be a reason why they didn't work. If you teach him to go outside or in a litter box you need to praise him when he goes. If you catch him going where he shouldn't pick him up and take him to where he should and praise him if he continue to go in the right spot. If you don't catch him going in the wrong spot but see it later you can not punish or correct him for it. He by this point has forgotten all about it and will only be confused for why he is being punished.<br>  <br>  Scheduling works well. Some of the best times to take a puppy out, when you wake up, before bed, after a nap, 20-30mins after water, 30-40 after food, before you leave, when you get home. <br>  <br>  Lastly never rub a dogs nose in their urine, hit, kick or harm your dog physically in anyway. These do not teach him anything and in some cases could cause him to become fearful of you or aggressive towards you.<br>  <br>  I also encourage you to take a look at a few of my resource links, aspca.org and veterinarypartner are 2 great ones with helpful tips.|`|FdcWPp48aa	House Training<br>  <br>  <br>  House training your dog is simple if you follow a few basic rules. Remember that puppies younger than 10 to 12 weeks have little control. Accidents will always happen when teaching puppies to be clean in the house. Be kind and patient, and reward handsomely all outdoor elimination. Always remember that dogs do what works for them. Make outdoor pottying work really well for your puppy.<br>  <br>  <br>  1) The puppy must have NO time unsupervised in your home. NONE. If you are not directly watching the puppy, it should be in the crate, or outside in a safe area. You MUST watch the puppy at ALL times when loose in the house. Use baby gates, crates, or tie the leash to your belt.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) The puppy should sleep inside the crate by your bedside. This way you can hear if the puppy should happen to need to go out during the night.<br>  <br>  <br>  3)  You must go WITH the puppy outside for ALL trips for elimination. You must have treats with you. When the puppy is urinating, say "GO PEE PEE" in a nice praise tone of voice the entire time. When she is finished, pop the treat into her mouth at once, and praise praise praise. This should be something she gets at no other time, like tiny pieces of string cheese or boiled chicken. Same for defecation. Say "GO POOP" while she is going, and food reward and praise afterwards. You must observe and reward ALL outdoor potty time. <br>  <br>  4) Keep a schedule. Feed at the same time, and walk outside at the same times. Your pup needs at least 4 trips outdoors each day, and 5 is probably better. Pup needs to go out at wake up time, lunch time, 4-5 PM, after dinner or any other meals, and before bed. Younger puppies may need to go out much more often.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) Use a key word each time you go out. I say "Let's go out!!" in a happy tone of voice each time I'm opening the door to go out with the dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  6) If you catch the puppy IN THE ACT of eliminating in your house, CLAP YOUR HANDS, say AH AH, OUTSIDE!! And immediately rush her outside. If she finishes there, do your usual food reward and praise.<br>  <br>  <br>  The keys to getting your dog reliably housetrained are:<br>  <br>  <br>  SUPERVISION: NO loose time in the house if you are not watching<br>  <br>  <br>  REWARDS: ALL outdoor elimination MUST be observed and rewarded. If you only do this ONE thing, your puppy will get housetrained.<br>  <br>  <br>  PATIENCE: Anger and punishment have no place in dog training. Elimination is a natural and pleasurable experience for your dog. You can teach her to not soil your house, but punishment will NOT help. It will only teach the dog to hide when she needs to eliminate.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have applied these techniques carefully for 4 weeks and you are still finding spots or piles after the fact, it's time for stronger measures. Roll up a newspaper and fasten both ends with a rubber band. Keep it handy. The very next time you find a spot of a pile that the dog has left behind, whip out that newspaper, and hit YOURSELF over the head firmly several times as you repeat "I FORGOT TO WATCH MY PUPPY".<br>  <br>  <br>  Works every time.<br>  <br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  This article copyright 2004/2007, RedyreRottweilers.

What u could do is put him in your bathroom with papers on one side of the floor and blankets, food, water and toys on the other side of the floor.  Put a baby gate across the doorway and then he can see out the door.  Keep him in there when you are gone for the day or part of the day.  Is there any way you can put your cat food up on a chair or cupboard so he can't reach it?

Parakeets usually molt once or twice a year.  Her feathers should grow back in 5 to 10 weeks.   She needs extra warmth and nutrition at this time.  Give her plenty of her favorite fruits and veggies, as well as cuttlebone or crushed eggs for calcium.  Misting your bird can help, too.  By misting it, your parakeet will preen itself more, which can result in some feather growth.  If none of this works, I'd consult with an avian vet.  Considering that you can see her skin and you say she has no feathers under her wing, it sounds like an abnormal molt.  Usually the cause of this is stress, poor nutrition, or illness.  Just because a bird gets old doesn't mean it should be molting heavily.  Best to get your parakeet checked out by the vet.
NkIczELyaa	I would keep her away, but it don't need to seem like your punishing her tho, and you still need to show her affection, because cats are very jealous, so if you can show her that just b/c the little ones isn't getting all the love she will warm up to them eventually, I would just be careful letting the littles ones near her for a little while.

A dog with easy trainablity is what you probably want - size isn't as much an issue and be prepared for a lot of training as most puppies will see any other animals as a toy. <br>  <br>  A poodle might be a nice choice as they are highly trainable and would probably respond well to a multi pet household.  <br>  <br>  BTW, 6 is nothing in cat years.  They can live to 15+.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Whether or not your dog will get along with your cat probably has more to do with the cat than the dog.  You can train the dog to behave around the cat, but in my experience, cats are pretty untrainable when it comes to behavior.  Go to your local shelter and find a dog that is abot a year or two old. They will have already behavior tested it to see if it is good with cats or not and a slightly older dog will be less likely to try to play with the cat.|`|SCD6Pdtnaa	I highly recommend the dog breed selector on Animal Planet. There are a bunch of questions and you rate what you would like in a dog (what size, whether they need to get along with other animals, how much time you want to spend playing with them,etc.), and then it gives you a list of the dogs that best match your criteria. You can then click through to read a bit more about that type of dog.<br>  <br>  I used this when I was choosing what kind of dog to get.

They are easy to train and and they can do without a backyard. Like all dogs do you need to walk it once a day, or at least try to.

D4ot0qLpaa	There are three possible reasons why your nan is saying no. <br>  <br>  Possible Reason #1. She doesn't really believe you'll take care of it. Many, many kids and teens promise faithfully to take care of a pet, only to get bored with it in a few weeks or months. Your nan has already had exactly this experience with having to take care of your dad's pets. (And I'm sure he also promised to take care of them!)<br>  <br>  If this is the problem, just saying "I'll take care of them" won't help. You'll have to PROVE that you can be trusted to keep up with their care in the long term. Who takes care of the dogs? If it's not you, see if she'd agree to let you take care of them in order to prove yourself. If it is you, but you're not doing a good job, forget it - you're not getting a rat because you've already demonstrated that you won't really care for it. You could try taking on some other chores and doing a really good job with them. One way or another, your nan will not say yes to another pet if she knows that she will be the one who gets stuck taking care of it.<br>  <br>  Possible Reason #2: A new pet costs money. A proper setup for a rat includes a large cage, preferably with more than one level, hiding spaces and hardwood chews and toys and so forth. This can easily run over $100. <br>  <br>  If this is part of the reason, you can start saving your own money toward the expense of the cage and fixtures. Get a part-time job. Do whatever it takes. Plus, being serious enough to pay for it yourself may also help to prove that you are serious enough to take care of it.<br>  <br>  Possible Reason #3: Many people have a "gut-level" dislike of rats, or even a fear of rats. This is especially true of older people, as they may have actually lived in old-style housing that had wild rats in it, or grew up hearing horror stories about how rats would bite people and give them diseases. And it IS true that wild rats can do that.<br>  <br>  Most of these folks have never been around a domesticated pet rat. Domesticated rats are clean and usually very friendly - but they still look a lot like wild rats, so they still set off that fearful reaction in many people. <br>  <br>  If this is the case, there may be nothing you can do. You could try seeing if she'll come to the pet store with you to meet and handle a clean, friendly pet rat. But chances are she won't. <br>  <br>  You can try getting some books out of the library on pet rats and show her some of the pictures. Pick out the ones that look really cute and nonthreatening - clean, pretty rats with light-colored fur (white or tan or spotted, not wild rat colors) and brown or black eyes (since a lot of people find rats with red or pink eyes ugly or scary). Stay away from pictures that show the tail very prominently, or that show rats with completely pink "hairless" tails - those make some people queasy. Baby rats are especially cute. YouTube and Google Images may be especially helpful. Here are a few good pics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pets747.com/uploaded_images/pet-rats-717618.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets747.com/uploaded_images/p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fancypetrats.com/pet-rats-images/grooming-baby-pet-rat.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fancypetrats.com/pet-rats-ima...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/2111920/Fancyrat1-main_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NQ-6xbikLs&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NQ-6xbik...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW10SMedZKE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW10SMedZ...</a><br>  <br>  Your aim is to show that they're friendly and endearing, not scary or ugly. If she thinks they're cute, and is willing to read a little bit about them, try sending her here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art4125.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art4...</a><br>  <br>  If she's not very internet-savvy, chances are she'd be more likely to look at a book. And the nice thing about books is that you can just casually leave them around, without being pushy. :)<br>  <br>  However, if your nan really dislikes them or is afraid, it is not fair to keep pushing her. You would not like to live with an animal that you were afraid of, and neither does she. You'll have plenty of opportunity to get any kind of pet you want when you're an adult out on your own, and that time is not too far away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AcvsnkKCaa	when i wanted a dog, i cried all the time until my mom gave in and said i could have one. you should do that with your grandparents. if that doesn't work then be really nice and ask for a special occasion. don't bring it up too often though. you might annoy them if you do that.|`|N5tF9xjdaa	I don't have much time, and though I'd love to share lots of info and tips with you, I'd like to point out and exaggerate one thing:<br>  <br>  rats are NOT like other rodents, and are very social.

gjrbp1Aoaa	Of course there's no real reasoning.  It's something some people assumed and then passed it down.  I wonder if any of these people think it will benefit their health to have children.<br>  <br>  Some people think because something is "natural" it's right.  In nature most of the litter would not survive and the population would remain balanced.  But pets are already taken out of nature simply by virtue of being pets.  People who feed their cats a raw diet don't simply go buy a bunch of mice and release them.  As responsible pet parents we have to do our research and learn from nature but not simply assume everything that a cat would do if left alone is going to be alright for a pet.<br>  <br>  My mother told me my hair would grow faster if I cut it.  While it may appear that way because it removes the split ends, there's certainly no actual reasoning or reality behind a statement like that. <br>  <br>  To those who believe it is good for a cat to have kittens - is it good to have them ripped away from her at 12 weeks old or earlier?  How has it benefited her to do all that work and have them ripped away?  In nature kittens would stay with mom until they are ready to live on their own, certainly not at the young age when they get re-homed. What about over population?  Is mass killing of kittens in shelters natural? Even if you find homes, what about the ones who won't be adopted in their place?  And what about the homes, are you sure the kittens won't be abused?  Is it natural for people to use kittens to train dogs to fight or to be used in experimentation? <br>  <br>  When you hear a piece of information never assume that it's correct.  Do your own research. There is so much false information that gets passed around, whether it's about pets or people, Don't assume that someone asking for your credit card number over the phone is legit and don't assume that the stress of pregnancy or even the stress of a single heat cycle is going to benefit a cat. <br>  <br>  <br>  I guess the short answer is that people are often lazy and that sort of "reasoning" allows them feel like they've done something good instead of forcing them to think about the numerous consequences.|`|cj31x3UMaa	The excuse I always hear is showing their children the "miracle of life"<br>  <br>  What if something goes wrong? Uterus twists/torsion & the cat dies horribly if not rushed to a vet. Kitten too large & c-section is required. Kittens are stillborn or deformed. Mother does not have milk or has problems nursing & the kittens die? Yes - go for it, show your children all these wonders - mortality rate for kittens born outside/in the wild is 50%.<br>  --------------<br>  It is proven that ONE heat cycle, ONE litter puts a female cat into the "at risk" category for mamary cancer.<br>  <br>  Animals not DNA & other health screen tested for breeding purposes should be neutered/spayed before hormones kick in. They make MUCH better pets & will live a longer happier life if kept inside.|`|AA11906603	Probably they want it to be a fun and educational experience for their kids.

They are both my friend and companions. They like to ride in the car. I take them on hiking trails with me. I choose trails that are unlikely to have dogs. However, she has defended me from more then one dog, as she is  protective of me. <br>  <br>  The pygmy watches TV with  me and sleeps on the foot of my bed at night. The dwarf on the floor because she not fully pody trained like the pygmy is. <br>  <br>  When my wife complained about the goat sleeping on the bed. I thought to myself, what the hell my wife complains and bosses me while the goat has always been loyal and faithful. Guess which one got the boot? The wife, da!<br>  <br>  It is fun to watch them. Sometimes they stand and walk on their hind legs. The dwarf if she thinks that the pygmy is getting the better food or some such will just stand and look at her for a long time, then start breathing hard, then just charge. <br>  <br>  The dwarf is a great tatle tale. She will come find me to tell on the pygmy if for example we have a visitor who comes on the property and pets the pygmy or if the pygmy gets into the road etc.<br>  <br>  The pygmy is the life of the party!

IuYekkPVaa	You are correct that it's proteins (usually FelD1)  in the cat's saliva that causes allergies and not their coat.  Allerca, along with the "Ashera" is just another money making scam from a convicted fraudster.  You can read more about this in the articles below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.digitalchangeling.com/blog/2007/03/allerca-you-make-me-cry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalchangeling.com/blog/20...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/asheras.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/asheras.htm</a><br>  <br>  There's a lot of speculation at the moment that Siberian cats have less of the protein FelD1 in their saliva, making them better suited to people with allergies.  However, there isn't enough scientific data yet to prove this conclusively.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shadowheartsiberians.com/ShadowheartSiberianCat/Hypoallergenic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shadowheartsiberians.com/Shad...</a>|`|RN1wGlWWaa	The Colorpoint SH/Siamese/Oriental and Rexes all have coats that shed less then normal.  So do Burmese, Ocicats and Bengals.  Other breeds that might work are Sphynx, Siberian (longhair), and Russian Blues.  The American has a longer/thicker coat and will shed like any normal coated cat.<br>  <br>  If you are mildly allergic, then you probably will be ok with one of the above (not the American SH).|`|oDVx7nSxaa	A Colorpoint Shorthair is nothing more than a Siamese in a coat color other than blue, chocolate or seal.   All three breeds you've mentioned still produce dander, which is what most people are allergic to - so you're right, they still wash themselves and leave dander on their coats.  Some people who are really allergic to the fur can tolerate a cat with a close, fine coat like a Siamese (or Colorpoint shorthair, or Oriental shorthair) or a Rex, but they are not "allergy friendly".  <br>  <br>  I have no experience with the Allerca cats, so I can't help you there.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	The only allergy friendly cat I've ever heard of is Russian Blue, but I know it's not a 100% thing.  My boss' wife was allergic to cats, but was able to have two Russian Blues without any problems.  Their coats are extra dense, so maybe it keeps dander way down, or maybe genetically the protein in their saliva people may be allergic to is slightly mutated.  No way to know for sure except through personal experience.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	you are correct, there is no such breed that is allergy friendly.  Your either allergic to cats or your not allergic to cats...<br>  <br>  By the way - dont waste your money on buying a cat from them.  I knew someone who spent a lot of money on that website to get a cat that they thought was allergy friendly, it turns out, she was more allergic to that cat then any other cat she's ever been around..<br>  <br>  Dude, they want $7,000 per cat!  That is absolutely insane.  If you want a cat and you have allergies, go to a shelter and play with a few that you're interested in - see how your reaction to them is.  You could always take Clariton D or Zyrtec.  My boyfriend is allergic to cats and thats what he takes and they both seem to work great!|`|hetZz4c1aa	Allerca does not have a creditable track record, so I would stay away.  The only way to be sure you can tolerate a certain cat is to spend some time with the cat.  Many breeders are understanding about these situations and encourage you to visit.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Yep, those are breeds, and no, they aren't allergy-friendly.  No cat is truly 'hypoallergenic', since the allergens are produced from the cat's skin, ('dander'), saliva, and to a lesser extent, the hair itself.  <br>  The only breed that may be better for allergic persons would be a Sphynx, the hairless cat.  With frequent gentle bathing, these cats are less likely to 'shed' allergens in the environment.  <br>  <br>  I have heard bits and pieces about the Allerca cats...I know for a fact that cats produce several allergens, so if they've eliminated one, that doesn't account for the others.  I also know for a fact that cat allergens are some of the worst out there, so cat-sensitive people are at much higher risk for developing other allergies and tend to have worse symptoms.
OrvTG44laa	Stay away from reptiles, fish and hermit crabs.  They are pretty boring and very annoying and expensive to care for.  They really aren't rewarding.  I suggest a rat.  If you aren't familiar with rats being pets, you'd be surprised at how clean, docile and intelligent they are.  Rats rarely bite and are very social.  They will crave your attention and they want to be with you.  They bond with you too, and are very easy and inexpensive to care for.  A rat at a pet store is generally 4 to 10 dollars.  A good cage will be about 20 to 30 dollars.  They are playful and make very good pets.  They require little attention, but will be happy whenever you are around.|`|Sn4zj9T3aa	get a rabbit!!|`|XUZ17OOraa	i think you should get a Ferret :D<br>  <br>  there awesome :D<br>  fun, playful and are like dogs cos they'll become your best friend!!<br>  not like a hamster who just stares at you lol ( and i have 2 ) :P<br>  <br>  there small and cool and you can bring them for walks and everything :D<br>  <br>  best of luck with your new pet :D|`|vTID6OS8aa	Um, I think it all depends on how much money you're willing to spend. If I were you I would get a small dog or cat, they are much more fun to play with and good to have around. But they can be VERY expensive, so that's just my opinion. And by the way, I have 8 hamsters and they make pretty good pets they are just very hard to tell if they are a boy or girl...trust me I made that mistake once and ended up with 13 baby hamsters!!! So just be careful on what you pick as a pet and make sure it is something you would want to keep and be committed to for life.<br>  <br>                     GOOD LUCK!|`|p0Jbbkopaa	I had a bearded dragon for a long time and he was the best small pet ever. He was so friendly and wanted to be held all of the time. He would sit on my shoulder all day and I actually would go out to run errands and he would come along.<br>  <br>  It may be rare that you find one that docile, but it's worth a try.
wgtjMcjEaa	I work at a veterinary clinic, and have had a diabetic cat for about 6 years as well, and I have never heard of this happening with animals. You should never raise the units because this could cause the animal to crash, but I have never heard of the insulin not absorbing because of it being stuck in the same spot so many times. I guess, if you are worried about it, just rotate the spots where you give the injection.|`|ZGI9pyYCaa	Sorry but your first problem is talking to a human with diabetes, who is not a veterinarian, and knows nothing of your cat's medical history or treatment.  Please do not take medical advice from a non-professional for your pets.  Only your vet can determine your cat's insulin needs, which means you are responsible for getting your cat regular checkups, glucose checks when your vet advises, fructosamine levels done to monitor insulin effectiveness, urinalyses, monitoring weight and diet, and checking regularly for other health conditions commonly associated with feline diabetes.  <br>  <br>  You should know that it is not uncommon for a well-managed diabetic cat to remain on the same unit-dose of insulin for some time.  But, there are various factors that can necessitate an increase or decrease in a diabetic cat, including weight, nutritional or dietary problems, urinary tract infections, secondary infections or other health problems associated with diabetes.  You should only rely on your vet and testing to determine whether or not the insulin dosage would require change.<br>  <br>  Be sure you are giving insulin correctly.  One does not inject the needle directly into the skin, the skin must be tented first, then inject the needle (i.e., subcutaneous).  This is true for any subcutaneous injection.  Most insulin needles are so fine that it is very unlikely insulin would ever get "encapsulated" into scar tissue in a cat.  Please discuss that with your vet.<br>  <br>  Owners should never change the amount of their cats' insulin without first getting the cat examined and tested by their veterinarian.  Frequent monitoring by your vet is crucial to feline diabetic management.
hkYmcddjaa	i wouldnt put in the 2 new ones with your current ones seeing that hes bigger then the 2 new ones. they do tend to fight and become territorial so i would suggest putting them in a separate cage.  i work at a pet store and a customer came in telling me that her guinea pig was bullying her new guinea pig and wouldnt let him eat or drink anything and caused it to die|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	It depends on where you live. In the inner city you might want to give the other pigs a small knife before letting them in the cage with the ghetto pig. Throw a small couch on the front of the cage. Let them hang out with a few 40's and get acquainted. Other areas just introduce them. They will get along just fine.
QV2WQsd8aa	The male was never taught to share his food.  Some dogs will guard their food if never taught to share.  My one dog became food aggressive at 4 months old when a new puppy tried to share his food.  We worked with him and taught him it is OK for other dogs to share his food.  Also taught him it's ok for humans to touch his food.<br>  <br>  Never take their food bowl away from them while they are eating.  This is also another cause of food aggression.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I have dealt with food aggresssion a lot, and would like to think that I'm pretty good at dealing with it.............<br>  <br>  I need to know more details.  You said that "We have 2 dogs" but then you said "his owners leave food out."  Who's dogs are they?  Is the male neutered?  Was the male gotten as a puppy?  Do you live with the dogs?|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	For some it is that they have been starved. For others it is just their natural personality. <br>  <br>  It needs to be trained out and put under control immediately. You can complain to the owner. A food aggressive dog is  DANGEROUS. <br>  <br>  I've dealt with this many times and being a good leader, making the dog understand that mealtime has rules and that they will never be left hungry helps. Small steps each day and lots of reward helps. I never leave food out. I feed at a certain time every day. For bigger and more active dogs, I feed two meals daily. I make the dogs sit and wait for the command to eat. I put up their food if they do not eat. I never allow them to eat from another dog, or cat's bowl. Because of this I have 3 rescue dogs who never fight over food.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A male who would attack a female is a problem dog. Many male dogs see females as a resource to be guarded, not a rival to guard things from. Most males will take alot of abuse from a female that they would never take off of a male. <br>  <br>  Reminds me of people, really. ;)|`|xktfWz5Caa	I am a huge fan of Cesar Milan, the Dog Whisperer.  I watch his shows on National Geographic Channel faithfully and have learned sooo much from him.<br>  <br>  I had the same problem in my home.  The aggressive dog thinks he is in charge.  Cesar says that there should be only one "pack leader" and that is YOU.  Basically, all humans in the home should be the pack leaders.  If you cannot get the rest of the humans in the home to cooperate, it probably won't work.  <br>  <br>  Try watching The Dog Whisperer.  I was able to teach my dogs (kindly, no harsh treatment) that "I" am in charge in my home.  It was so simple.  Now, they all eat together and I can put my hands in their bowls and they just back up.  It's amazing.<br>  <br>  A word of caution, I would not leave those dogs together unsupervised.  My brother had the same problem with his dog and his room mate's dog.  The aggressive dog almost killed my brother's dog (over 100 bites on her belly) AWFUL!... all over a bowl of food we think.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12128656	a lot of dogs are born food aggressive or protective, and some just grow to be that way. many times it's just a sign of dominance. (the alpha eats first) it all boils down to instinct.<br>  <br>  i have 6 pit bull terriers, and 3 are food aggressive. i feed those three in their crates. when they hear me pick up the food dishes they run to the crates, i feed them, and let them out when they are all done. it helps them to relax because they don't have to watch for other dogs who they think will steal their food.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	What schnoodle mom88 said.^<br>  <br>  <br>  Look it may not be your dog and you don't know his full history and why and all that. But you can feed them separately. Pick up dishes when the dogs are done and don't allow either dog to feel threatened when eating. If you want to slow him down throw a big rock in or a couple tennis balls.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Dogs live in hierarchies- pack leader & then the rest.  The male is asserting his dominance over the female.  With wild canines, the leader eats first & then they work down the line to the lowest in the pack.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	dogs become food aggressive from food being taken away from them.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Three full bowls of food and it still eats your female's food - it's no wonder the poor dog isn't bloated...<br>  <br>  Food should not be left out 24/7, especially if you have a food-aggressive dog. That can spell trouble for any other pet OR child who doesn't know better than to go play in the dog's kibble. If he always seems hungry, a trip to the vet should be in order - the dog may have worms or may be ill.<br>  <br>  I would feed your female AWAY from the other dog, and feed HIM in a crate or blocked off room. <br>  <br>  PS - You live in the house which means you can do SOMETHING. Separate them for feeding and offer to feed the male yourself at the appropriate times.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Firstly the male was never raised or trained correctly especially socialization which is an important development for a puppy or any dog.Training a dog re food requires patience and if one does this from the time they get the puppy they will avoid a food protection issue.Basically you train the puppy to sit before food is put down and there are several steps in this process and if repeated many times puppy learns.Re socialization if a dog is not walked or meets other dogs and people as a pupy it is very hard to re-socialize them although l do this as part of a living so l know exactly what has happened to this dog and the person who supposedly owns it should have never have had it as he or she did not understand or bother to train the dog at puppy stage in any way.The dog in his mind is alpha and the female obviously has a sweet disposition is alloiwng him to get away with all his bad habits as there is no point in her challenging hiim that is not in her Nature.<br>  The only thing you can do in this situation if you live in a House with other people is try and get them to understand the male has to fed once a day seperately and the female seperately with the male nowhere around and unlesss all of you are prepared to do this then nothing will solve this issue.Even if you feed your female in your room,let her finish her food and then let her out to where she usually goes then she is              under less stress and the male will not have the chance to steal her food or a potential fight occur which may happen in time as you can push a dog only so far.No dog should have accesss to food 24/7a really lazy and bad habit.If you people can pool your resources and get a crate to feed the male in and then all will be happy it is not too late.As said above he is food aggressive as he has never been socialized or had any rules set down as a puppy and that is sad.re eating all the time has he eveer been wormed?If he is eating so much and not gaining weight there are 2 reasons for this and one is the possibility of worms or he has an internal organ problem which has gone undiagnosed.Whether the so called owner of the dog will bother to give the dog yearly shots,worm he dog or even put water down is dubious and to me the dog deserves a better life than what he has now..<br>  My pups are taught from 6 weeks to sit for food or they are fed in their individual crates and know exactly which is theirs and when food time is approaching.Never never leave food out 24/7 you will encourage poor eating habits.One of my females an adult well trained re Obedience titles and a show champion was one time enjoyig a bone and l went up to say drop and she growled at me let me assure you she never did it again as l let her have it as she knew the rules of this household all food bowls and bones can and will be volunrtarily surrended if l wish .In actual fact you do not take a bone away from a dog you let the dog give it to you there is a difference there and the same aplies to this male he has never been taught how to eat food correctly.
pvm8wo9Waa	Ok, get yourself a leash, a bowl, an alarm clock and a blank notebook.  <br>  <br>  Go to www.akc.org and research dog breeds.  Find some that appeal to you.  Think about their exercise and grooming requirements and how much time you will devote to these.  Write a short essay about the 3 breeds you think suit you best and why.  Then locate 3 reputable breeders for the breed you're most interested in. Find out the going rate for a pet quality puppy or young dog. <br>  <br>  Save your money until you have enough saved for the dog, all puppy shots and supplies for the puppy's first year.  See if there is a puppy kindergarten or obedience class you could enroll in and have that information handy too. <br>  <br>  Next, write out a puppy potty training schedule and exercise schedule.  Set your alarm and get up in the middle of the night to "potty your puppy."  Keep track of each time you do this and demonstrate to your parents all of these activities.  Research what constitutes a reputable breeder and any health issues in the breeds you are interested in.  <br>  <br>  Have a plan for activities you can include your puppy in, get basic books on puppy care, learn about socialization and basic training.  Think about what you can do with your dog when you go away to college.  You may want a small breed that you can take with you into apartment life later.  Plan for this now.  <br>  <br>  Make a list of basic supplies.  Call vets in your area and ask about the cost of puppy vaccinations and annual vaccinations and care.  Figure in the cost of flea treatment and heartworm preventive and spaying or neutering.  Write up your total costs, what each is for and have more than that amount in case of an emergency.  <br>  <br>  If you can do all of this, demonstrate your ability to make a puppy schedule and stick to it, come up with the full cost of puppy's purchase and care, know what he needs and are able to care for and train him, then you are probably ready for the responsibility of a puppy if your parents agree.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	Volunteer at a shelter for six months.<br>  <br>  Be sure and work on the grammar as well.  <br>  <br>  Use punctuation in sentences.  <br>  <br>  *Which* is kind of like what.<br>  *Witch* is an ugly old lady that rides around on a broom.<br>  <br>  Edit: You can volunteer with a parent at a shelter.  13 year olds can volunteer for lots of things.

It is such a reward to have a wonderful pet and furry friend.
9kceDOTraa	Well actually my idea was going to be use of UV, but if this it out the window, I'll tell you a couple of rather cheap methods I have used along a similar line.  I never actually got green water, but I've had that brown algae get out of control before, and I used 2 things.<br>  <br>  A phosphate remover, combined with Algone.  I usually don't like to use complete chemical treatments, but this really hammered down on the brown algae, is fairly inexpensive to work.  It seems like you have the light aspect well controlled as well, so my guess is, it's got too many nutrients needed.  You may want to try take a look at your O2 levels.  It may be too high and causing algae to thrive before rooting itself into your substrate and glass.  I think if you take out it's other fuel source, Phosphate and look what your O2 saturation is, you should get the upper hand on this problem.  Algone as well helps keep algae nutrients under control and is fairly cheap.|`|yjsIhHeuaa	Salt, or it could be your glass thats the problem, have you tried using comercial solutions to aleviate the alage? mainly just get more invertebrae's and a pleco.|`|nlRr07dRaa	Carbon filtration works wonders!

They are loyal, eager to please and learn, they do shed but if you vacuum everyday it shouldn't be a huge problem mine is in the house and its not a big problem.

lj3hNR9baa	While it is true that companies make products just for the money, I have no idea as to which company does. As to treat your fin rot, it is usually caused from stress, making the betta more susceptible to bacteria. You should make sure that the pH, ammonia and nitrate are at the right levels in your tank. You also want to make sure that it is fin rot and not fin lose.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fishjunkies.com/Diseases/finrot.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishjunkies.com/Diseases/finr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nippyfish.net/finlossfinrot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nippyfish.net/finlossfinrot.h...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a few websites about fin rot and how to treat it.

H06PtiIAaa	no with the 10 gallon. in theory it makes sense to start small to see if you can do it. but THIS is the biggest mistake. the larger tank the easier it will be.<br>  <br>  a 125 is a good size and you will have plenty of options for it.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is start with a fish only with live rock system as reef tanks need more work and more skill as you need to know alot about water parameters for corals. <br>  <br>  To start your aquarium the easiest way is to clean the tank and then add live sand. around 1 pound per gallon. then fill your tank with saltwater, use a hydrometer to measure the salinity so that is its 33 PPT or 1.020 specific gravity.  <br>  <br>  Add marine buffer to buffer the ph to 8.3. marine fish need a higher ph. <br>  <br>  make sure the filter is on and the heater.<br>  <br>  Add live rock about 4 days later, live rock is expensive but provides structure and biological filtration, around 1 pound per gallon. By adding this, your cycle process has started.<br>  <br>  It is best to do a fishless cycle so it can take around 2-4 weeks until your water parameters check out.<br>  <br>  Then i would get a protein skimmer for a 125 gallons.<br>  <br>  Start with a few fish and allow your tank to settle. <br>  <br>  Wait aorund 8 months for your tank to become established before adding corals. Your corals will be determined by your lighting that you want. Power compacts are the basic and min for corals, where you can upgrade to T5 or Metal halide.<br>  <br>  Depending on your lighting you might need to get a chiller as MH lights for example will make the tank too hot.<br>  <br>  again if you choose to go reef you will need to learn alot about chemical supplements like calcium, magineseum, strontium, iodine, carbonate all additives for corals.<br>  <br>  So there is alot to learn about reefs, not overall that hard, but you will need to do alot of research and willing to learn and do things the right.<br>  <br>  if you need any help please feel free to contact me.

Has anything changed in the house recently? Anyone new come in? Is he an indoor or outdoor cat - could a new cat have moved into the area? Have you even used a different cleaning product or moved some furniture around?<br>  <br>  First thing to do is probably get his health checked by a vet. If he's peeing in small amounts, frequently, it could be the start of a urinary problem; these can be serious in males. A vet can also give you some behavioural advice, and supply you with Feliway; this is a cat pheromone that comes in spray and diffuser form, it's a useful tool for dealing with any situations of stress in cats, including ones resulting in inappropriate urination.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	If he's not neutered, then he is marking his territory.<br>  If he's neutered, he could still be marking his territory (some males just get into this awful smelly habit).<br>  <br>  In any case, he could have the beginning signs of bladder issues, rather common in male, older cats, and usually starts with no outward signs other than 'inappropriate urination'. A simple urinalysis at the vet can tell if he has some medical issues, and most are easily (i.e. inexpensively) treated.|`|6983c7f9d93e9211705b2f6efb462e43aa	You said he so I am assuming he is male, sometimes as male cats grow older they do this I suggest you have him fixed after a short period of time he will stop.I am not sure why they do it he may just smell a female cat somewhere but I would get him fixed and the problem will go away.
7SyCZnM9aa	I wouldn't be worried. Sometimes their tastes can change. There are other foods high in vitamin c that you can give him. Here is a list:    <br>      * Sweet red bell peppers<br>      * Parsley<br>      * Broccoli<br>      * Cauliflower<br>      * Strawberries<br>      * Mustard greens<br>      * Papaya<br>      * Grapefruit<br>      * Kiwi<br>      * Oranges <br>      * Cantaloupe<br>      * Cabbage<br>      * Tomatoes<br>      * Raspberries<br>      * Celery<br>      * Spinach<br>      * Pineapple<br>      * Watermelon<br>      * Tangerines<br>      * Limes<br>      * Cranberries<br>      * Guava <br>  You can try any of those. Also there are liquid vitamin c drops you can put in his water and vitamin c pills that you can give him. They're made by the oxbow hay company. If you feel it's because he misses the other pig (both males so they're probably always going to fight) try getting a larger cage or hutch. This may help any territorial issues.|`|AcvsnkKCaa	i had guinea pigs and when i gave them a new food they always didn't eat it until a day or two. if he/she has been eating it for a while then, maybe he/she's tired of it. give him/her something new and healthy all the time. i gave mine salad pieces. <br>  <br>  hope this helps. bye!|`|dUiLMwZyaa	Because he doesn't want to eat your orange.<br>  <br>  So you're telling me that wild guinea pigs run around eating oranges evry day for vitamin c?  <br>  <br>  He'll eat it when he's good and ready, just make sure he has his hay and pellets.|`|tss8aoDcaa	put him back with the other male piggy hopefully he will then eat the orange|`|G3NqFgYlaa	Most guinea pig food has supplementary  Vitamin C and he should be getting enough.There are also treats and special foods to fulfill a guinea pig's nutritional needs.<br>  <br>  Many guinea pigs are picky eaters and often change their minds on a particular food. <br>  You shouldn't be worried about him unless there are serious symptoms like sickness etc, because he really seems just fine, but is just  going through a phase.<br>  <br>  There are other great sources of Vitamin C too, such as strawberries or even grapefruit-and citrus.

They both "stand" propped up on the bathtub edge and swat at the bubbles - they aren't playing either, I tested it and put some bubbles on my hand and went towards them with my bubbled-hand.  They both FREAKED OUT and attacked the bubbles, hissing and spitting and swatting until ALL the bubbles were off my hand and then they proceeded to lick my hand and purr up at me.

65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	In a study of 100 cats that were infected with heartworm, 25 of them were 'indoor-only'.  You can't keep mosquitoes out of your house.  (If you can, please tell me how!)  Same goes for fleas, mice, etc.  No matter where you live, you can have the occasional rodent in your home, and if your cats eat the rodent or have any contact with it, they can pick up all sorts of parasites.  You can bring fleas inside without knowing it, for example if there are stray cats, dogs, or wildlife anywhere around your house, there is a source of fleas, ticks, and intestinal parasites.  <br>  Revolution is great stuff, but I agree, it is expensive.  If you can get a 3-month supply for $30, that's a pretty good deal.  At my clinic, MY cost for ONE month is $8 per cat (ouch!).<br>  <br>  If you absolutely can't afford that, a cheap alternative is BioSpot.  It kills flea adults and eggs, kills ticks, and kills/repels mosquitoes, and is very affordable.  For example, <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com</a> has a 3-month supply of BioSpot for $20, and I'm sure you can find it even cheaper elsewhere.  However, it does NOT prevent heartworm disease.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Even indoor cats are at risk for heartworm - if you live in an area where dogs are commonly on heartworm preventative, then your cats are at risk for a bite from an infected mosquito as well.  While your indoor cats are not at great risk for earmites or worms, I agree, there aren't too many safe options for cats for heartworm.  <br>  <br>  Mine are all on Revolution for all but the 3 winter months of the year.  We have a screen porch that they enjoy during the summer months, so they are exposed to fleas and mosquitoes.  We are in an area where heartworm is considered a real risk, and since one of my cats actually tested positive on the heartworm screening test, I've been very diligent about using Revolution as soon as winter breaks.|`|0mb78CiWaa	I use Capstar flea killer tablets for my cat. It kills fleas in a few hours.<br>  <br>  Then I give her a bath to remove any fleas from her fur. And put the liquid flea preventative on her. Program works good.|`|cj31x3UMaa	ADVANTAGE is the best FLEA ONLY medication. Works fast, you do not have to treat every cat & you will not need to bug bomb. It is also non-Rx.. check Amazon & Yahoo prices<br>  <br>  REVOLUTION does not work as fast on the fleas, but covers a lot of other things... as long as you do not get lazy & assume that ALL worms are covered. Still Rx only.<br>  ==============<br>  If I am *only* dealing w/ fleas, I use Advantage. If I have just got a new cat that came w/ ear mites I use Revolution.<br>  <br>  If I am showing... I use a higher dose of PROGRAM (non-Rx). This one is oral & many breeders use it as a preventative/cure for Ring Worm as well. It does not work for everyone (did not for my vet), but last time I was "gifted" w/ this problem & was getting nowhere w/ dips after a month... a Persian breeder suggested I try it. By the end of the next month the ca was 100% clear & all hair had grown back out. Program *is* a flea medication, use as a ring worm treatment might not be on the box, but you can google for case histories.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Indoor cats are not safe from fleas, they still need a complete flea treatment. If they are currently free from ear mites, I would say it's unlikely they'd get them as it requires close contact with another cat - cats usually get them when young, from their mothers. Indoor cats still need protection against worms, especially heartworm if you're in an area where that exists. <br>  <br>  Everyone has their preference. Mine is Frontline Plus and Milbemax, for complete flea and worm treatment. Regular Frontline is the cheapest (useful) flea product, but Frontline Plus is a more complete treatment.<br>  <br>  Seriously tho - you're not going to take the opinion of some stranger over your vet's are you? Buy online for cheaper by all means (but be careful it's the genuine product)<br>  <br>  Chalice
hetZz4c1aa	Yes, it is legal in China and very sad.  However even when very difficult for us to understand, sometimes we have to show some tolerance for the customs of others.

But who said that we only eat the non-cute animals?  I love a good steak, but a cow is sacred in some countries who see us as barbaric for eating them. We just have been brought up differently, and have different customs.  We can disagree all we want but its not going to change.  Its their right.|`|RluCMVUSaa	Okay I love animals and have two cats... but this is a cultural thing.  These people handle very few items for consumption in manners that we would consider "sanitary" in the western world.  Now it is dead wrong to steal a pet and eat it, but look into the amount of resources that it takes for us to eat our large livestock, cows are the worse food you can consume if looking at the resources wasted on raising them.  They don't have the resources to raise cattle and pigs and sheep and all these animals that we eat here, small animals that breed and mature quickly such as chickens, rabbits, cats, etc. are just easier for them to produce.  Now I am not saying it is right, I am just saying that tolerance is best and that a movement to save people is much more needed (Darfur) than it is to keep people from living off of eating cats.  I mean we don't care about chickens and the horrible conditions they are raised in because we don't pet them, but they are treated terribly.  A cat to you and I is a pet, to them it is a meal and we should treat all animals humanely not just the ones we want to pet so either reform everything or to each society their own culture.<br>  <br>  People in the world are starving... should we really care more about the cat that someone is eating or would it be better if all starving people were given a cat to eat?

It seems like the UK is taking more action than Americans.<br>  <br>  You can sign this petition if you would like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/13/please-stop-cat-and-dog-slaughter-in-china?page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/13/please...</a><br>  <br>  Yes, it is an outrage. China has a lot of problems right now though and animals are adding to that list. China is dirty (have you seen the fog?) it is overpopulated not just with animals, people are going hungry, etc. They can only have 1 child, and they don't like girls as they don't carry on their name. A lot of children are up for adoption and only some being adopted.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! There are a lot of problems in America too....<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  They don't see it as something wrong to kill animals. It's normal. They were brought up different and there it is okay to kill animals. Because the UK, US, and other countries disapprove it causes them to do it in hiding.|`|KvCLR9Bpaa	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  IM GOING TO ARRANGE TO GO TO CHINA AND GO TO ONE OF THOOSE HORRIBLE PLACES AND THE NXT HEADLINES WILL BE: <br>  <br>  YOUNG GIRL KILLS CAT KILLERS!!! just u wait and see!|`|vQxStqR2aa	No i agree people do horrible things to animals be it cats or dogs. When money gets tight people throw away their pets even though the pets didnt do anything or didnt make them lose their jobs or the stock market go down yet their the ones punished for it. Many times people will get a pet then fall on hard times or get frustrated & throw them out then when things get better or they get lonely they go out get a new baby one & start all over again while the first one is still out there trying to understand what they did. My boss was telling a story about how in the military he was on base & befriended a cat who he took in after a while. He got a new sofa or something & started living off base & the cat peed on the sofa so he punished the cat who accidently did it again & he shot it with a 357 over a garbage can holding it but then tail.
AcvsnkKCaa	he's not insane. just maybe he wants to be funny and know what water feels like. my dog did that before... he's a young pup too. when he's older, the idea that you think he's insane will wear down.|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	Hahahaha! You have nothing to worry about! Depending on the breed, your dog might be what they call a "water dog". <br>  <br>  I adopted a dog from the animal shelter and we can only guess what breed(s) he is. One thing we know for sure is that he LOVES water. I've seen him jump IN the toilet. He's 64 lbs now, so hasn't tried that in a while, but he loves to get wet. Our friends have labs and I've seen them jump in and out of a hot tub repeatedly until their owners pulled them away. <br>  <br>  Oh, and if it seems like your dog is going for more than a dip, my dog will stick his whole face in his bowl when he drinks. It makes a big mess and we don't know how he breaths, but he does it everytime! Water upto his eyes! We thought he'd grow out of it, but its just another silly thing he does that makes us love him.|`|AA12240925	Maybe he wants to play in water. What kind of dog?|`|AA12237148	You know puppies they do their own thing lol|`|sQOXjKFNaa	He sounds like a bit of a clown. I love puppies they are so unpredicable!|`|7Rp256IOaa	LOL!  Your puppy is perfectly normal!  Chances are he saw something at the bottom of the bowl and wanted to investigate.  You may have inadvertently reinforced the behavior by laughing at him.  But hey, what a neat trick that would be!  Enjoy!
eo0Uv7Wsaa	First of all DO NOT DO NOT put soap on them as one person said. If they go to preen or anything it could make them very sick (the soap). You could try misting them with something similar to a water bottle. OR you could clip their wings and make a little perch in the shower and set them there with a toy so they get the mist. Try to tame them first. Here is a site that will help. For the taming you also need to clip the wings...they will grow back. This way they can't get away from you...it's going to take time because you need to all three of them at different times and when doing it they should not be able to see their cages or one another.  Good luck!  <a href="http://parrotcentral.net/how_to_tame_a_small_bird.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/how_to_tame_a_s...</a>|`|T99QygpKaa	Its nothing to be worried about. They will eventually bath. Sometimes you wont actually see them doing it though! But if you are worried, this normally helps:<br>  <br>  Clean their cage nicely, take their food and water bowls outside, then take their cage outside. Once the cage is outside, put the food and water bowls in. A clean cage and clean surroundings is a great encouragement to help birds bath.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could go and buy a little bird bath with a mirror in it. This also helps encourage them to bath. If both of these don't work, then get a little spray bottle, and adjust the nozzle to a "soft mist" rather than a hard squirt, and mist them down a bit. Sometimes when they are wet, they will bath. It is very important to get a gentle spray bottle, because rough squirting could scare the birds, and it will make them hate being misted.<br>  <br>  Also dont use any soap or detergents in the water, as it will affect their skin. And might cause bad reactions.. and im sure you dont want that to happen.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! =]|`|15JDwvRKaa	wow. i have 3 also. <br>  <br>  u have 2 give them time to get used to the tub. and besides, birds r smart. they dont really do it when u r lookin at them. like humans, birds need their privacy. and sometimes they do go in it but u just dont see.|`|vLqSEudSaa	You have to rub the soap on thier body and not immerse them in the water. when you are done, you have to clean them witha towel. a littlesoap still on them wont hurt them......i think|`|7Hu5zv1kaa	just put a plate in front of it and it might take a bath by itself|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You are bigger than they are, so make them take a bath. Get a mist bottle (made for plants) fill it with warm water, take them out and mist them. Just be gentle with them.
Bw18seFqaa	NO!<br>  <br>  baby toothpaste is made for babies, not dogs.  Many baby toothpastes also have xylitol in it, which is TOXIC to dogs.<br>  <br>  If your dog wont let you use dog toothpaste, you wont have any better luck with baby toothpaste either.<br>  <br>  Use pet toothpaste.. start off slow..  use the finger brush, put the paste on it, and let the dog lick it off, praise the dog.  Gradually you will work towards putting your finger in the mouth, and slowly work towards actually brushing.  Praise the entire time.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider taking the dog to the vet for a dental cleaning also.. bad breath may be cause by dental problems, and the vet can asses that during the cleaning.<br>  <br>  Diet is another factor.. if your dog is eating mostly wet food, it tends to accumulate on the teeth and cause plaque build up.|`|eL268hETaa	Human toothpaste isn't for dogs. The fluoride may be toxic.  Did you try one of the beefy flavoured toothpaste with the fingertip scrubber?  Maybe it's not the toothpaste, but the PROCEDURE she doesn't like...<br>  <br>  Teethbrushing doesn't always fix bad breath.  I paid $100 for the vet to professionally clean my pet's teeth and her breath will still knock you over.  The only thing you might want to do is have her eat Dentabones or Greenies or mint flavour treats.  Other than that, just steer clear of her breath.  They don't call it "dogbreath" because it's appealing!|`|zzpKGLaKaa	Human toothpaste will probably upset her stomach, I wouldn't recommend using it. There's a reason they make dog toothpaste.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Don't use human toothpaste on animals. Human and animal toothpastes are completely different. Human toothpaste works by abrasion, animal toothpaste by enzymes; don't mix the two.<br>  <br>  If your chihuahua has terrible breath, she likely has terrible teeth. Tooth brushing is a preventative measure only; if she has any form of dental disease, like a build up of plaque, this will need to be dealt with by a vet. You can then use tooth brushing to prevent further dental problems.<br>  <br>  I advise you to take her to the vet to have her teeth checked, particularly if she's over 5 years of age.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|2O58btqxaa	no
C1eHfhrHaa	How about if you don't let her eat paper towels?  They absorb water and can cause constipation or a blockage.|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	Errrr - yeah - move the paper towels out of reach. This could cause a serious blockage in her stomach.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	You are not being responsible. Don't let her get paper towel it could cause a blockage and she could die|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Why dont you put the paper towl where she cant reach it.  Problem solved!
lj3hNR9baa	Sounds like your female is not pregnant, but is full of eggs.<br>  <br>  Is your male making a bubble nest? should look like something like this: <a href="http://rahmonster.smugmug.com/photos/43917089_bLuwh-S.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://rahmonster.smugmug.com/photos/439...</a><br>  <br>  Since the divider is clear, the male building the nest and the female getting full of eggs is an indication that they are ready to mate.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	She's not pregnant since they are egg layers and the male is needed to fertilize the eggs outside the body.  She may be swelling in response to developing eggs, and she may drop some, but they won't be fertilized.<br>  Best of Luck!
zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behaviorist.  Without pictures, it is hard to guess... sound like just a calico cat.<br>  Now if you are very worried about your baby, please don't wait, take it to the vet.  They cat take an xray to give you the best answer.<br>  <br>  Is the pet sleepy, aloof, no energy?  If no, then she is ok.  Is she fix? if no, and she goes out.. she is pregnant. <br>  <br>  But I had always told people, when in doubt call the vet please..|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Your cat's color is called "Black Smoke".  Its not common but not rare.  Just means that one parent was a smoke to produce it.  Its not a recessive gene like dilute or pointed.  He would be a domestic long or short hair depending on the coat length.<br>  <br>  Mom cat needs to see a vet.  It could be anything from worms to FIP (wet form).  But she needs a vet quickly.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Odds are he's no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.<br>  <br>  What you're describing is a cat with "Smoke" colouring.  In Smoke coats the lower part of the hairs are light and the hairs are tipped in black.  I had a Blue (dark grey) Smoke and White domestic years ago like this.  Google "Smoke" and cat and you'll see other cats with similar coats.<br>  <br>  Get your other cat to the vet.  That doesn't sound funny if your cat has a badly bloated stomach.  I had a cat years ago that suddenly developed a large stomach and it ended up a tumor in his stomach and he had to be put to sleep.|`|8Y9timR4aa	call the vet|`|9DtJeAUKaa	It would help if you had pics & the description was a bit confusing on the black & white one, no offense. You gave 2 different descriptions. lol <br>  Maybe a Tuxedo, Ragdoll or mixed? Your vet should be able to look at him & either tell what kind he is or guess way more accurately than the average person due to knowledge/experience. His sound is his unique sound, not a specific breed sound (when it comes to cats).<br>  <br>  Your Mama cat could have worms if her tummy remains bloated. You can try the over the counter stuff, but I have found w/ that the worms just come back. Fleas cause worms, so give her a flea bath, comb her & keep any fleas/eggs from the home or wherever you have her environment. Revolution which is only through a vet, I have found to be 100% effective against fleas/ticks/worms & other parasites in my cats. Yes, you will pay a few dollars more than an over the counter remedy, but it's worth it because you will get your money worth since the vermin won't return to aggitate your beloved kitty. If it's not worms, your vet should see her to determine the problem. She could be pregnant if she isn't spayed.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Not enough information to say about your mixed breed cat.<br>  <br>  As far as the momma cat, if she is not spayed, she could be pregnant.  If she is, and has not been tested, I would suspect worms.  If the stomach area is firm and tight, worms would be my first assumption.  If she goes outside and catches critters, that is where they can get worms, as well as flea bites.|`|xktfWz5Caa	Oh please take Mama to the vet soon.  There are feline diseases (FIP) that can cause the accumulation of fluid in the stomach and chest.  I'm not trying to scare you, just to be safe... take her to the vet.  I have an overwright kitty but he's overweight all over.  I would be concerned if it was just his belly.<br>  <br>  Your other kitty sounds adorable.  What an unusual color.  I LOVE floppy cats!|`|yBp1NcqRaa	Mama may have worms. Take her to the vets just in case. if you leave it to late you may lose her.<br>  <br>  Or if not spayed and goes outside she may well be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Take her to the vets either way. Just to be on the safe side.|`|c4d63478f0175c245353b6222ab7a81eaa	When you say that he's floppy, he could be a ragdoll cat. Yes that is a breed and they are called ragdolls because they are floppy. Also it cannot be a calico if it is a male.
SccU9zdNaa	I would advice contacting a wild-life rescue. They are gorgeous creatures, but they aren't meant to be kept as pets. I don't know why they would be giving them away.<br>  When i looked them up it says that the Hammerhead shark, in the wild, eats bony fish. This includes Herrings and Sardines. Look it up first, since not all types of meat are going to be satisfactory for it. Some meats will have more or less Protein and/or nutrients than others.<br>  <br>  But seriously, don't keep this little girl. She wasn't meant to be kept inside a house and be a pet. It isn't like a dog or a cat. She won't be happy.|`|0tuC42J3aa	I don't think you should let it go. I think you should keep it.

But probably way older than that, 'cause we kept saying she was 19 for years.<br>  <br>  we just fed her regular cat food, mostly dry, but nearer the end (15 -17 +) we fed her wet food, when we found out it wouldnt make her fat.|`|AA10892706	My oldest kitty ever is my calico girl who is turning 17 this month.

fkYJHmkhaa	All puffers are mean little buggers and will eat just about anything else you put in the tank, however there are some exceptions to the rule.  For a warf puffer you don't really have to worry too much about having your other fish eaten but its generally a lot easier just to have a species only tank with maybe one or two oto cats to eat the algae.  Also most dwarf puffers aren't too picky about what they eat, i just fed mine freeze-dried bloodworms and the ocasional snail and it loved them!  These are general guidelines for puffers but juts keep in mind that not all puffers are gonna follow these rules, they can be wusses or they can be devils its all up to chance.  Hope you pick a good one!|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	well puffers are very aggressive so its best to keep them with their own kind they also love to eat crabs and crustaceans<br>  hope this site helps<br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/how_to_choose_fish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/...</a>|`|fnLhqbDpaa	For one thing puffers require a bit of space ..even for a dwarf the smallest i would go would be 10 gallons. Next the one fish i know that you can keep with them safely are plecos. Also you MUST feed puffers snails (the little tiny kind) If you do not their teeth get overgrown and they cant eat at all) some will not eat anything that isnt alive so you need some tiny feeder fish as well (like guppies) also most puffers require somewhat brackish water (salty) so you need to read up on the kind you want to get <br>  But they are really great fish very very interesting and smart ..good luck

What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean?

Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_Just_Fine_on_Dry_Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_...</a><br>  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.   <br>   THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL<br>  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters<br>   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods.

Dry does NOT help keep teeth cleaned and its better to get the water content from canned foods then to rely on them drinking water eating dry food.  <br>  <br>  Think about it - do cats in the wild eat hard crunchy foods?  Or do they eat softer moist food?<br>  <br>  Good brands to get are Wellness, Innova, Blue Buffalo, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup, Max Cat, or Royal Canin.|`|AA10233318	Be very wary of corn, grains and any fillers. Watch also for by products. Dry is good for teeth but if low quality with grains may cause diabetes in the long run, here is a helpful guide|`|fboC1N7gaa	I feed my cats a wet and dry.  I use Petguard Premium.  Other good brands are Innova and Evo.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	Ash is from the meat that is cooked at high temperatures in wet food.<br>  What you want is a high quality protein (meat) which will have less ash.<br>  Ash is not always bad you just want less of it.<br>  A quality canned food from Wellness would have less ash than Fancy Feast.<br>  <br>  Feeding a combination diet is best.<br>  The dry food offers some help in combating plaque.<br>  Many dry foods are filled with unnecessary ingredients like carbohydrates and fillers.<br>  So when choosing a diet you want protein to be in the first few ingredients vs. corn or rice.<br>  When looking for a dry cat food it should be packed filled with omega fatty acids as cats need to get these acids through their diet.<br>  As they do not make then on their own.<br>  <br>  Canned food should be offer high quality protein,egg,greens.<br>  Canned food is mostly water which is great because cats tend not to hydrate themselves as much as they should.<br>  Males should always be offered quality canned food as it just another method of flushing them decreasing chances of blockage.<br>  <br>  Your concerned with weight management.<br>  In my experience if you want a cat to loose weight you need a prescription diet. <br>  Store brand food doesn't reduce the calories enough and its no simple task to get a cat to exercise.<br>  You could choose a prescription diet like OM or RD and use it for weight loss.<br>  Or you could try a reduced caloric diet strictly limiting portion size and seeing if it is of any benefit.<br>  <br>  Do not change brands of food on cats as they will become finicky.<br>  Cats will find a food and will prefer whatever consistency it is.<br>  <br>  In closing try a reduced caloric diet of both wet and dry.<br>  It should be a diet made with high quality protein,greens,omega fatty acids and minimal carbohydrates.<br>  If portion control does not work and weight loss is critical try a therapuetic diet offered by your vet.<br>  <br>  Take care|`|AA10859773	Ash is what's left over after meat is processed.  Lower quality meats create more ash than better meats.  Outside of the fact that lots of ash in food indicates crappy ingredients, it's not really something to worry about.  If your concern about it relates to potential or past urinary issues, it's still not something to really worry about.  <br>  <br>  Weight management food - there's no magic ingredient to look for.  What you do want to feed is species appropriate food, not the high-carb foods that are so prevalent.  If you'd like to learn more about the RIGHT weight loss plan for cats, see my blog (link below).<br>  <br>  Because it's better to feed wet food than dry, free-feeding isn't really an option.  However, some cats are self-regulated and won't overeat and you can let their appetite determine how much they get to eat.  But for overweight or overly-hungry cats, it's best to figure out how much they can eat in order to lose or maintain weight.<br>  <br>  Wet is better than dry.  Dry food doesn't clean the teeth and does very little to promote dental health.  Whatever benefits it may provide are typically not worth the risks.<br>  <br>  Variety:  You don't have to offer variety but I personally prefer to.  I think it helps keep cats from being overly picky, plus if they ever go off their food you already have a substitute handy.  But I would stick with no more than three different protein sources (meat) or 3 different types of food.|`|8e22bfdba1a9faa96a6056ffacb1a19caa	I have been using Iam cat food premuim,costs $18 at Walmart,$16 at Target for 7 pound bag<br>  <br>  My cat has lost weigh,more energy,leaner,more happier<br>  <br>  Give the food 4 weeks, watch ;)
SccU9zdNaa	The 1" per Gallon isn't really a good scale to go by, since could you put a 10" goldfish in a 10 gallon tank? no, the thing couldn't turn around and he would make WAY to much waste.<br>  <br>  You want to look for some small community tropical fish. Tetras are good idea. some people have luck with guppies, though i can't advice trying that. <br>  Try Tetras, Oto's, shrimp, snails, or most anything that fits these requirements: <br>  <br>  1. Don't place bettas with other brightly colored fish or fish with large flashy fins like guppies or mollies. They occasionally react to them as though they are another betta and sometimes show aggression toward those fish.<br>  <br>  2. Don't place bettas with other Anabantidae fish such as Gouramis. Anabantidaes are fish that possess a labyrinth organ allowing them to breathe air from the water's surface when dissolved oxygen levels are low. Because they are close cousins, bettas generally will be aggressive to these fish as well.<br>  <br>  3. Don't place bettas with other aggressive fish or fin nippy fish. Nipped betta fins can become infected or generally stress out your betta leaving him open to other ailments.<br>  <br>  4 Bettas are tropical freshwater fish and shouldn't be mixed with cool water fish like, goldfish.<br>  <br>  5. As I said, some bettas will attack anything you put in the water with it. The only way to know is to try. Some fish that usually work well with bettas are, small catfish like Otocinclus and Corydoras, Snails, ghost shrimp, and Neon Tetras."<br>  <br>  Good luck. And remember, some bettas will attack everything and anything. Others can be and have been housed with all sorts of outlandish tankmates|`|wnnudNp5aa	Corydora catfish are good, and Platies make excellent tank-mates for Bettas. Platies are fine with or without other Platies, but Corys prefer to be in groups of 3 or more. You can do Neon Tetras, but they have to be in schools of at least 5 or 6. Some people have trouble keeping them alive for some reason, too.<br>  Avoid known fin-nippers and aggressive fish, and any fish that have long, flowing tails or fins, like fancy guppies. A Betta can mistake these for another Betta and attack them.<br>  Remember, only 1 inch of fish per gallon of water. Good luck!|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	I've never put my bettas with anything, but I've heard otocinclus are good.  They clean up the algae that may form in your tank.|`|FBSXz8L9aa	iv heard corys are good fish and get along with almost anything, + they arent fin nippers.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	I don't think beta's are supposed to live with any other fish.|`|AA12205365	Cory, and platy do well as people have said.  Shrimp, and snails like ghost shrimp, mystery snails work well.  As far as fish any peaceful fish that can out swim him work well.  (Many betta will chase fish around for a few days until they tire him out.) Watch out for fin nippers like tetras, and barbs.  Watch out for gourami as they have similar territorial responses.  Guppy are okay, but avoid the showy fancy ones.  Interesting fish:<br>  Sparkling Gourami (too small to fight with him)<br>  Endler's Livebearers<br>  swordtails<br>  molly (avoid the large sailfin hybrids)
twVyisGnaa	You're already doing the right thing pretty soon, which is to get your female cat sprayed and your male cat fixed.  Until then, keep them in separate rooms, and never let them out of your sight.<br>  <br>  As for the reasons why your pervy cat is doing that, in 3 to 6 months cats are sexually maturing, so they're kinda exploring and stuff.  But yeah, get your cats fixed.  And yes, your cat does look like a little perv from that look in his eye.  lol<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If your cats are not neutered and spayed, they will mate.  At least you are getting them done this week.  Males can get a female pregnant for up to 2 months after being neutered, so keep him away from any unspayed females.<br>  <br>  Kittens should be done by 3-4 months old before they go into heat.  She's LONG overdue for a spay.|`|7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	You are going to have to separate them. When she gets home from being spayed she could get seriously hurt if he is jumping on her like that. Keep that rapist away from her...haha..but seriously do.|`|0k2y3bNgaa	Different rooms are the way to go!|`|8da67ac25bf0b572bff8917067bcb303aa	Aww that picture it cute.  Anyway, it is cat's nature to want to mate and your female cat is already at her sexual maturity.  She actually already may be pregnant.  If she is pregnant the vet will still spay her but I believe it costs a little more.  I would keep them in separate rooms.  Once the female is fixed and if she was in heat when they spayed her, then you will have to keep her away from all unneutered males for six weeks.  Your male cat isn't a perv, he just wants to make babies.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Looks like you will be having kittens. <br>  <br>  If neither of your cats are fixed you should not be allowing them to be in the same room together. <br>  <br>  If she isn't already pregnant from all that interaction... I'd keep them seperated until they atleast one of them in fixed.|`|Z5ereta1aa	hha well put them in separate rooms and close the doors, put their food/water bowls into their rooms to keep them away until she is spayed. Lol the look in his eyes is hilarious! like hes thinking ( oo ala where are em kitties?)<br>  <br>  good luck and hope i helped!<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  <br>  the rice bunny =)|`|kuFAx4ymaa	LOL.<br>  <br>  Its nature, dont worry about it.  Animals dont 'make love' like humans...  Normally it looks like rape.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I'm glad to hear you are getting them fixed. Just keep them seperated til tomorrow morning when the female gets spayed.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	Is the males name Big John?<br>  LMAO!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Female cats reach sexual maturity at 6 months or earlier. So your male isn't a pedophile. :P Their behavior is normal for two adult cats. If they are too loud or they are disturbing you, you could keep them in separate rooms until you get her to the vet. Good for you for doing the right thing and getting her spayed!
7vJNHaskaa	We have ceramic cat dishes that aren't too deep. I don't know how crazy your cat gets, but I don't think that they would tip over.<br>  <br>  You could probably get them at any pet store or even a grocery store.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I'm looking for one for the dog - cause our one cat likes to play in water and tips the bowls over.<br>  <br>  I used to have a heavy duty ceramic/earthenware bowl that was impossible to tip over.  I just checked in our feed store for one and all I can find now is plastic stuff.  I'm still searching too.<br>  <br>  The only other suggestion for you (which I might have to do) is to find the wire racks that hold the bowls.  I'm looking in Foster& Smith and other pet catalogs for something to work for me.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	You should go to any good pet store and buy 'weighted' cat dishes, or you can buy them that have 'stands' that will hold them down and together and that makes them less tippable.  You think you have problems with your cat trying to bury his dishes when he's done eating?  I have a kitten who is sure she's human, and refuses to drink out of any bowl ... I've had to give her a glass ... but since she can spill a glass too easily, her glass sits in a low, weighted bowl on the floor ... so she thinks nothing of taking a drink from my glass and spilling that one instead!  She also likes a bit of 'people dinner' and must have her own 'people plate' to eat it from ... we now have a pack of very small paper plates, but as soon as she discovers we don't use them, they'll become 'garbage' very quickly.  Cats are simply weird, but a true cat person still enjoys them.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Try stainless steel no slip bowls like these.  <a href="http://www.onlynaturalpet.com/product_detail.aspx?item_guid=3CE2803C-8BA0-4624-9ECF-05A681D00E98&click=124&mf=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlynaturalpet.com/product_de...</a><br>  <br>  What kind of bowl do you usually use? Stainless steel or glass food/water bowls are the best choices. Cats have an excellent sense of smell, and since their noses are so close to their mouths, they work hand in hand. Often cat's don't like plastic because it makes their food/water smell like plastic, (and they‘re also harder to keep clean, and bacteria will remain in the bowl). Also, if the bowl is too deep/narrow the cat may refuse to use it because their whiskers are very sensitive and they don't like them touching the side of the bowl.|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	PetSmart or PetCo. :)|`|VkXQq2y2aa	If you can't find some in stores, try ebay or online stores.<br>  <br>  Goodluck !

A nice tank can have a variety of fishies in it Mollies, tetras, barbs, guppies, silver dollers, angels, pleco's, ....the list can go on and on really, just make sure you know a little about a fish before you buy it, or trust you're local fish seller to tell you the truth (which isn't allways the case if they are just trying to sell fish) A "mean tank" can also be fun and very entertaining. Buy baby cichlids (sooo many varieties) and watch them grow up, just make sure they are all the same size or they'll eat eachother, and make sure there are plenty of hiding places!!
AA11901352	Absolutely needed water/salt filtration hydrometer, testkit. (a source to increase PH like dolomite/sand shells for the base, although even a base is not needed)<br>  <br>  Depending on the size of the tank a protein skimmer isn't NEEDED, but is nice to have.  Usually under 30 gallon it isn't needed.<br>  <br>  It is going to depend on what you plan to have in this tank.  All fish have certain requirements.  Are you planning on specific corals?<br>  <br>  The more you add and the fancier you get the more that is required for the tank.  Having a ph of 8 - 8.4 is needed.  <br>  <br>  You will move up from there with protein skimmers, jets, upgrade in lighting (top and bottom), perhaps live rock (although not needed) these are things that can be added later.  Really  water, marine salt, filtration (can be one of many different types), hydrometer, testkit.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	if you are serious about keeping marines i would suggest you talk to the local fish shop.you can also put keeping marine fish in your search engine,there some good sites i have just looked at that are full of good advice.marines are in the main expensive and can be a problem without good advice.<br>   hope this is of help to you|`|t5vQeaSJaa	read the mags ask at you lfh and talk to other fish keepers.skimmer is needed filters, living rook is dear but work test kits but then again apart from testing the sg on mine I do not bother and every thing is fine, lights more the better pumps heaters, and lots of other things , can be expensive to set up ￡1000,s or ￡100s it is up to you but they are worth it.|`|A57lSFLdaa	At the end of the day i think that everything is essential.Especially filters and lighting!<br>  Seapets has some great filters<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.seapets.co.uk/search-results/searchvalue/fluval/category/7/sort/relevance/order/desc/results/51/query/and/page/7?gclid=CJyT8-zPlpkCFUM-3godbTLKbQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.seapets.co.uk/search-results/...</a><br>  <br>  For lighting there is this:<br>  <br>  www.aquarium-lights.net/<br>  <br>  For you fish tank i would look under flourescent lighting strips to provide sufficient lighting for your fish.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good look with your kit.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Water is a good start|`|XXnMgwxYaa	fish would be a good idea. lol

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Let's bypass your question for a few minutes and get to some important things to consider...<br>  <br>  Where the h*ll do you live that you don't need to have a permit and KNOW something about alligators to own one? Or do you even own it legally? If that's the case, you need to put it back where you got it from before you create a monster.I'm not going to get into maximum sizes, because ~if~ (very big word for two letters) it gets to any size at all, it WILL ruin you if it gets ahold of you regardless of people wanting to use unofficial, hundred-year-old measurements when saying how big gators can get.<br>  <br>  What do you plan on doing with it when you can't keep it anymore? Do you live somewhere where he can live outside in a pond when he grows up? This will happen quicker than you think, and remember, if you live where it gets cold, he'll have to have somewhere not only big enough for him, but WARM enough for him when it gets cold. Think you're going to give him to a zoo when it comes to that point? Think again. Unless you've already made arrangements with a zoo, there are no zoos that will take it (*ss-u-me-ing that you have it legally and would be able to transfer it anyway.) because they have all the alligators they need. Transfer to another private owner? I'm sorry, but we all have the alligators that we have and very few of us will take someone else's subadult or adult alligator, we prefer to bring them up on our own. Sure, you could probably find an alligator farm that would take him, but keep in mind, alligator farms aren't in the business of "rescuing" unwanted pets... they're a meat and leather industry. IF you have this animal legally, I highly suggest, since you're already having problems and have done no research, that you go back to where you purchased it and explain to the owner of the business that you really didn't know what you were thinking, and would they please consider a return or exchange (ON SOMETHING YOU HAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW TO TAKE CARE OF, PLEASE).<br>  <br>  Now, to your question, if, after a few hours of ~SERIOUS~ thought as to why you want to own this animal you still think you want to keep it.<br>  <br>  In the wild, he would be living on a diet of insects and anything else he can catch, BUT, you can do better. Whole foods are best... fuzzy mice or hoppers (ask at your local pet store, they'll know what you want)... you can try frozen/thawed, but buy some long forceps or hemostats, you'll need to thaw them in warm water, and make sure they're COMPLETELY thawed. You can try just setting it in front of the little guy, but you'll probably have to dance it around a bit. Here's the thing, though... he sounds to me like he's stressed, so he probably doesn't want you standing over his tank trying to feed him. How long have you even had him? Has he had a settling in period? He's not in a main room with a bunch of activity, is he? He's scared to death if he is, and yes, little alligators can die quite easily from too much stress, heck, so can adults when it comes down to it. Next time you cook a whole chicken, give him the innards (probably not all at once depending on how small he is...) You can try some feeder fish, but he may not be able to catch them (and unless you've got a primo filtration system, they won't last too long with all the alligator waste you'll have to deal with.<br>  <br>  I really very highly suggest that you return this "pet" before you have to deal with serious consequences, and I refuse to teach you, step by step, how to take care of this animal, because that's not MY responsibility, it's YOURS and you SHOULD have thought about the long run BEFORE obtaining this animal. BUT, since I can't stand by KNOWING that someone is improperly caring for an animal... <a href="http://crocodilian.com/crocfaq/" rel="nofollow">http://crocodilian.com/crocfaq/</a> Read it. NOW!|`|21de4e5a242c9e97450f4b1622925da2aa	Do u even know what you are getting yourself into?  I am guessing not because you are trying to find answers on yahoo.  An alligator is NOT a pet!  They can grow up to 15-18 feet long.  Please take the alligator to the SPCA if you don't know what to do.  Also they are illegal to own as pets.|`|2qgg2G8kaa	I'm not an expert but alligators don't eat crickets. If that's what your feeding your alligator I'll tell you right now that it's not going to live very long. They need meat, as they swallow large amounts of pieces whole. Also do you know how large an alligator will get? Alligators will grow VERY LARGE. You will not be able to have it as a pet once it gets to be an adult. It will get aggressive and bite you if you aren't careful. Alligators are not a great pet to have. Do some research on what to feed it, and think next time before you purchase an alligator.|`|atxog9hFaa	Well, I don't know how you got a hold on a baby alligator, but whatever. Alligators eat raw meat, so try with some cheap grocery store, raw refrigerated steak and microwave it for a few seconds to slightly warm it up. Then, take a tiny 1x1 inch square of it and place it in front of the little one. See how it reacts. If it doesn't eat it, try dangling the meat in front of it by some tongs and wiggle it. If that doesn't work, try some other types of meat. Then, if that fails, buy a pinky mouse and put it in the cage for the alligator to eat.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	he's probably laughing at the fact that you're giving him something as measley as crickets. he needs meat and wild environment|`|lkZJWkZDaa	no way

Maybe that may calm him down???|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	You need to get it declawed and fixed. That's what I did to my cat and it humbled her little butt. LOL|`|jy9Jn0Xoaa	I have the same problem somewhat. I have a couple of scratching posts, and my male refuses to use them (he's eight). He has been neutered also so I don't think that makes too much of a difference. The only thing he will use for a scratching post is one of them round cat toys with the cardboard in the middle with the ball that they can bat / spin around on the outer area and also he loves the couch (it looks like hell on the corners). I have come to accept the fact that I will never be able to own a nice couch as long as he is alive (so in maybe about another 12 years I might be able to have a nice one LOL). You can yell at him while he is doing it and he keeps on doing it until you actually get up and start to go after him. The water bottle only helps if you actually spray him, point it at him and he still continues. You can buy double sided tape and put that on the area where he scratches and that might stop him (I have seen it in the Foster & Smith catalog) but then again he might just move on to another area to scratch.  He has also been known to attack me (sometimes viciously) and the he takes off like a bat outta hell. I can usually tell when he is going to do that  because he gets a "look" to him that I have come to recognize so if I see that I grab the squirt bottle or a newspaper and thwart that attack attempt most of the time. His attacks have become a lot less frequent now that hes getting older (neutering did help the frequency also) and I have learned to deal with it the best I can. Also I am the only one he ever attacks. I would never dream of getting rid of him because of the scratching and the attacks because I do love him and he is becoming more loving as he ages. He also likes to get up on the counter so he can drink off of the faucet (he likes it to drip, but not run slowly). This is another thing I live with because its just not that big of a deal to me. I have seen mats that you can buy (Foster & Smith) that set off an alarm when they jump on it that teaches them not to jump on the surface that you don't want them on that you might want to try. I have also heard that tin foil works also because they dont like the sound. Go online and order a Foster and Smith catalogue because they have lots of products in it that might help you. Good luck to you and if you have to give him up (hope you don't) I hope you will find him a good home and not send him off to a humane society where he more than likley will be put down.|`|hzZyNJGWaa	well for sure dont declaw him that is just taking away any defence he has, but you can dull his claws with those filling things, and find some way to condition him, for my cat any time she did anything she shouldnt have i shook "the can" (it was a tin can with coins in it) it scared her half to death and eventually she learned that when she does certain things the bad noise comes and she stoped.|`|yY1PTZ6Waa	Well, your cat sounds crazy alright, well what i would do in your situation is....<br>  1) if he claws at the carpet, try spraying him with a water bottle and tell him " No"<br>  2) Get his toys and lock him in a room<br>  3) get a new cat.....<br>  4) give him LOADS of attention!!<br>  That is the best I can do...<br>  Good Luck!|`|DUw4uaj6aa	You could read online, Or try to tap the cat meduimly when it's being bad.

A Bala and Rainbow should do fine together-- they'll rarely encounter one another due to their preferred swimming area.  However, Bala Sharks are schooling fish, and get more than a foot long each.  If you're keeping less than 5 together, you can safely consider yourself irresponsible.  They should have no less than 5 in nothing less than a 6 foot long tank.  Hatchets and Danios are also schooling fish, so I'd suggest you get about 6 more of each, bringing your totals to 8 and 9, respectively.<br>  <br>  29... All Tetras are schooling fish, and you've got 5 incomplete Tetra schools, and one adequate school.  There is no way you'll ever be able to complete 5 schools in such a small tank, so I'd suggest you add to the tank by subtracting.  Get rid of all but one or two schools, and make sure you've got 6+ of each of the two remaining species.  Rosy Reds are schooling, too, but this is less important than the Tetras, as they'll tolerate less social interaction.  Mollies are actual brackish water fish, and keeping them in freshwater often leads to health issues, including-- but not limited to-- fungus, fin rot, Ich, velvet, and the like; it's not fun, so I'd suggest you replace ALL your Mollies with Platies, which look similar, but need no salt.<br>  <br>  10... This is fine, even a bit understocked.  Consider taking ONE of the extra Tetra schools from the 29 gallon tank and moving them in here; as always, you'll want at least 6 (in this case, no more than 7 or 8 if you choose a smaller species) to make a healthy school.  The Danios will be fine in a 10 gallon, though a larger one would be ideal.<br>  <br>  5... Don't change a thing.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  The only tank you'd really even have a chance of adding to (other than moving a school of Tetras into the 10 gallon) would be the 55, and even then you'll have to be careful.  Rainbow Sharks are extremely territorial, particularly with their own species, or similar species.  You could try a group of 5-8 Glass Catfish, or a single Firemouth Cichlid, if you prefer, but I'd not try much more... you're walking a fine line in that tank.|`|nkmz8OCbaa	to me it looks like all of your tanks are over stocked. IMO the pleco and the bala will get to big for the 50
7Rp256IOaa	Tethering your dog to you is a wonderful way to bond with one another!  This is a fantastic way to be sure you can watch her every move.  You may not think this is much fun for your dog, but she will love the extra attention she is getting.  Not to mention you will be reinforcing the positives of being with you.  You are on the right track realizing that giving your dog run of the house right now is not the smartest thing to do.  They have to earn more freedom.  At this stage constant supervision is a must.  You will be able to learn your dog's particular signals such as sniffing, scratching, turning in circles.  They are all different.  Keep him on a regular schedule with frequent potty breaks and you will have a confident pottyer.|`|91CX5jHaaa	Yes, we call it the umbilical leash, and it works very well for rescues who failed potty training 101.  I can usually train puppies without having to resort to it, but it is the best step I know of for adults who never 'got it' for housetraining.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	That would be perfect, actually.  I didn't have the special dual-clip leash to use on our last puppy, but I did keep him on a leash until I trusted him enough to have run of the house.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	I used this method with my latest rescue dog. He was almost 7 months old & not housebroken when I adopted him. He learned fast & we really bonded quickly with this method too. I used a carbiner (clip like one used for climbing) on the leash handle & just clipped it to a beltloop. He loved being with me all the time & I was able to watch him 100%.|`|XavY3fiWaa	That is a great way to potty train your dog, that's how i am training mine.  I take her outside and if she doesn't go when i take her out i will bring her back in and keep her leash attached to me then i'll take her back out when she looks like she has to go.  You'll know to take your go out when she starts circling or sniffing around like she has to go to the bathroom.  But yeah keeping her attached to you by a leash is much better than keeping her in a kennel because she will probably enjoy being with you.  Good luck house training your puppy.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I train all my pups this way.  I use a crate also but all my pups go through a time when they are attached to me on leash as I go about my day.  Not only does this help with potty training and with keeping them from chewing things they are not supposed to ... it gives them a kick start with walking nicely on a lead as they naturally learn now to keep an eye on what I'm doing.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I have occasionally put a leash on my puppy when I needed a break from chasing him around everywhere.<br>  <br>  He always chewed the leash though so sometimes instead of a leash I gave him a kong with PB inside or a piece of ice to play with to occupy him so he stayed in one place. <br>  <br>  The only time I put him in a kennel while I'm home is when I'm taking a shower.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	I have not done that, (regretful)  but it's a great teaching technique I hear.  <br>  <br>  I'd be interested in knowing how it works out for you.
Idunjsxjaa	I have the same situation with my male rabbit.  My husband treats him well and gives him his favorite treat.  But when he tries to pet him, he runs away.  My son and I spend a lot of time on the floor with our bunny and play with him but husband doesn't do this.  I think if my husband would spend time with the rabbit as we do that he would warm up to him.  So maybe this is the case with your bunny.  Or it could be your dad's scent/cologne.|`|vtVeHKHPaa	maybe it could be his smell considering his colon or it could be his clothes. it could be the colors of his clothes too, since dogs only see black and white maybe its the same for rabbits!!!|`|kwzwzn9Uaa	maybe it is because he does not treat him/her properly i feel sorry though thanx anyway|`|0tjf1Hdgaa	probably smell.<br>  my rabbit didn't like anyone but me, he would growl and paw at everyone alse|`|25576a636659e589a9e5b2c96deebb86aa	It is most likly his scent...|`|8NSh1D4Maa	It could be that she finds his mannerisms, tone of voice, or even the smell of his deodorant, soap, or aftershave to be frightening.  Rabbits can take a dislike to someone for a lot of reasons, some less than rational, and they are very sensitive animals.

iVQULHqYaa	I think that you should allow yourself time to get over  the trauma of parting with your  dog. Please don't try to compensate by fostering dogs. <br>  <br>  I have had years of experience in  training dogs. I have rescued dogs and competed in dog sports. However my kids were grown up before I introduced rescue dogs into my home. <br>  Fostering dogs and rescuing dogs is a delightful experience. Unfortunately all rescue organisations will give their dogs a glowing report, however they don't really know about their temperaments.<br>  <br>  After reading your previous posts and the fact that you have confessed that you lack experience, I think that you should wait until your children are older before Fostering.|`|bIaywrBCaa	sorry but if you could not handle your own dogs, I think you are a long way from being a good foster parent. How about starting out by volunteering at the animal shelter and getting used to being around a lot of dogs. Build up your confidence and then try adopting. That is what I think you should do.|`|2idlwi6eaa	getting a puppy that has to be trained and grow with the family is a lot different than taking in a dog that has already been trained and needs the home.<br>  Make sure that the dogs you foster are housebroken and you should be able to come up with a good recipe for success.<br>  Do not take just any dog, make sure it is a comfortable fit.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|g4KHXYFPaa	I would not do it in your case.  Many of these dogs have been mistreated by children, and are very aggressive towards children.  If you do start fostering, wait until both of your kids are teenagers, and take this time to learn dog traits, behavior, training, etc.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Fostering dogs is a wonderful thing to do. You will be helping these dogs a lot, and it will be very rewarding for you.|`|wFBVuBOkaa	There aren't enough fosters in the world. I think you should go for it, but you're right to be hesitant.<br>  <br>  Go through some training first. Volunteer with some of the dogs and take some classes in dog training and behavior. This will help your confidence level. Also, one of the hardest parts of fostering is giving the animal up to its forever home - by working with and forming bonds with dogs that aren't yours, this will help you learn to let them go.<br>  <br>  Decide which kinds of dogs you want to foster. You say you are an inexperienced owner, so you should probably focus on adult dogs who don't have training or medical problems. Some fosters specialize in behavioral issues, some with other kinds of special needs pets, and you should definitely not do this kind of fostering unless you are very experienced. Some fosters also specialize in puppies - this requires a lot of education and experience as well, as puppy fosters have to know a lot about nutrition and watch for common puppy ailments.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and maybe in the process of taking classes and volunteering with dogs you might just find one you feel confident enough to adopt. And there's nothing wrong with that, either.
PuxAhQB6aa	People who are unfamiliar with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that will grow up to be horse-sized may be no taller than some ponies in their first months of life, they are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is too young to be ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they grow up to be horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	A pony is a category of breeds of horse that is shorter than 13 hands.  A miniature horse is not considered a pony.  They have to be under 33 inches at the shoulder to count as a miniature horse, and cannot have descended from pony stock.<br>  Add:  There is no such thing as a miniature pony. There are only miniature horses.  Problem solved!|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	The same difference between a regular pony and regular horse.|`|XB1IDYoraa	Google it, yahoo search sucks. take that yahoo.

d9e96a33f29e315d369cf3772856fb65aa	I adopted one about a year ago who was neglected and abused. I originally thought she wouldn't be anything immensely special as she has quills and hissed alot. I figured she wouldn't bond with me and would just run from me anytime I was near her cage. Boy was I wrong! While Hedgehogs are not the pet for everyone, they are certainly the pet for me. I named her Fiona and she has so much personality, it's hard to believe. <br>  <br>  She loves to spend time with me cuddled in my lap or in a bonding pouch I typically use for my Sugar Gliders. She really loves to play tug-a-war with little scraps of fabric and adores rolling on her back for belly rubs. One of her favorite things to do is run around in her ball and chase my cat. She is loads of fun and there's never a dull moment with her. She makes some pretty hilarious sounds and rattles her toys when she wants to be fed. She's pretty easy to care for, compared to my Sugar Gliders at least. <br>  <br>  She gets staple food at all times (I use Insectavore Fare from ExoticNutrition.com) then she gets a mixture of chopped vegetables and fruits every night along with my Sugar Gliders (she typically gets a mix of 3-4 types of fruits and veggies chopped pretty small. Some I use are carrots, lettuce, spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, grapes, bananas, apples, honeydew melon, strawberries, etc.) Then she gets a rotation of proteins throughout the week like my Gliders do. She gets live mealworms and crickets Mondays and Fridays, fresh cooked and shredded Chicken on Tuesdays and Saturdays, Steak Wednesdays and Sundays, and Canned Grasshoppers and Snails on Thursdays. <br>  <br>  So its nothing that's really difficult but its more care than say a pet Rat would get. Plus vet care is not required so long as you keep them on a healthy diet and keep their cage cleaned. They don't require shots or annual visits but yearly vet visits with an exotic veterinarian would be a good thing to ensure it's health. I think Fiona's company is well worth the extra effort and I can't imagine not being without the excitement of a Hedgehog  :]|`|OrvTG44laa	In my opinion, no.  They require a fair amount of maintenance and a pretty big cage.  They are very expensive too.  They are also solitary, so they won't crave your attention and will not bond with you.  They aren't going to be a very rewarding pet for all of the time and money you put in.|`|najva92baa	No......it wurd be quite cool to own one i guess......but they are wild animals. Plus it may end up costing quite a lot as it would neeed a lot of special attention and care.....:)|`|5M57TTfpaa	they are NOT wild and it would NOT be cruel. some ppl are so annoying. if you are buying it from a petstore or breeder, then obviously its not wild. they dont need special care, they are very simple animals to take care of. they need any normal attention animals need, and usually if you dont give it, they dont trust you. <br>  <br>  have you ever owned a hamster? thats what it would be like. some ppl like it, some dont, because they are not very active(except at night, and they like to run on their wheel alot). but they can bond with you, depending on how much time you spend with it. i own one, and wish i spent more time with her then i did, but im so preoccupied with my more active and demanding pets(plus, it doesnt help that i work 10 hour days and hedgehogs are nocturnal). <br>  <br>  and generally, the only thing expensive about them, is actually buying them. other than that, they eat cat food, and can use cat litter as bedding/litter, and dont require much maintainence except for a weekly cage cleaing and occasional bath and nail trimming.
MJDjaNtDaa	just calm him. it's okay.|`|MV4QN2maaa	Talk in a soothing voice and keep it pretty quiet and dark.|`|HULRxii5aa	Whatever you do do not touch the babies with your skin, as the mother will pick up your scent and not bond with her babies. And if there is a male rabbit with the female keep it away from the babies. Just keep everything calm, make sure your rabbit is okay and not in any major discomfort. Keep it quiet and relatively dark. It sounds like you are doing everything you can. Good luck and I hope it al goes well.<br>  =)|`|ZWsCHjIKaa	she should be ok, just let her do it and be there to help.... but if u think she is having trouble and more time has gone by then u expected, call a vets office and ask them what you can do at home and when do you need to worry or bring her in..|`|najva92baa	Get a towel and rest her on it...Maybe call your vet to see what he/she reccomends........|`|Vu0rQcoyaa	sweet i want baby rabbits|`|DUw4uaj6aa	Get a tiny basket with a old towel and rest the mother in it. Sit by her and try to be quiet and not pressure her. Once the babies come out, Let her help them until another baby comes out. When they are all out, Grab a towel and gently rub them with it but do not touch them with your skin. Gently place them back by their mother and that's it.<br>  :)
8NSh1D4Maa	This is the best site I have found for sexing rabbits, it has some good photos & explanations: <a href="http://www.rabbitnetwork.org/articles/sexing.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbitnetwork.org/articles/se...</a><br>  <br>  As far as which is a better pet, there is little difference between a neutered male and a spayed female, though in my experience males tend to be a tiny bit more outgoing, in general.  Unaltered, each sex has plusses and minuses:<br>  <br>  Males: Spray mark with foul-smelling urine.  Can be consistently territorially aggressive.  Hump things consistently.  Tend to be a little more outgoing and less nervous than females, generally speaking.<br>  <br>  Females: Territorially aggressive, not as consistently as males (tends to be more cyclical), but higher intensity when they are.  Have to deal with 'false pregnancies', have an extremely high rate of reproductive cancers (85% of unaltered female rabbits will get cancer by 5 years of age).  Can urine spray, but usually do not.  <br>  <br>  Another plus with altered rabbits is that you can generally keep them in pairs.  Rabbits do enjoy the company of another when hormones are removed from the equation.  You will get joy from watching them snuggle and groom each other, and they will like having a buddy.  Information on keeping multiples can be found here: <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-4/two-rabbits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-4/two-ra...</a>|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Male rabbits, if not neutered, are a bit too fiesty to keep around.

However I had a male rabbit who would attack you and severely break the skin, a male rabbit who was extremely mellow, and I currently have a female rabbit who is so lovely and snuggles into me then falls asleep. I think it just depends on the rabbit's nature.|`|oeat6boAaa	Sit in a comfortable chair and hold the bunny in your lap for a few minutes. When bunny is calm, gently cradle him/her with belly up and head, chest and back curled against your abdomen, and hind feet facing away from you. Be sure to firmly support the back, and don't allow the bunny to kick. A rabbit's hind legs and back muscles are so powerful and his skeleton so light (rabbits are built for quick getaway!) that one kick in a bad position can actually result in a spinal fracture! <br>  <br>  The prepuce is the fuzzy protuberance between the hind legs. Gently press down on the anterior part of it (the side facing you), and the pink tissue inside will emerge. In a young female, the tissue will appear somewhat conical, with a slit running from the tip, backwards towards the tail. In an older female, the tissue may be more "fleshy", but the slit is still generally from tip towards the back. <br>  <br>  If the rabbit is a young male, the pink tissue will appear more like a cylinder with a small hole in the center. If he's starting to mature, the tip of the penis may protrude. A neutered male's penis will usually not be large enough to protrude, though this is not always the case. A mature, unneutered male will have large, obvious testicles (more than one inexperienced bunny parent has mistaken these for "tumors" on their "female" rabbit, prompting Kevin to christen them "Bilateral Perianal Testosteromas") on either side of the prepuce. They are usually pinkish with rather obvious veins, but may be grey. They are somewhat "sausage shaped" and start just in front of the prepuce and curve backwards towards the tail. If the bunny is frightened, he may retract the testicles, making them hard to see. <br>  <br>  I looked this up hope this helps~!|`|SQApfrsyaa	the one on top is the male unless their gay then their both males.|`|RVlkauBRaa	The females have like a red line on their crotch.<br>  and the males dont lol<br>  <br>  Girls are better :)<br>  <br>  I (L) my bunns.
TjLCnxkKaa	Never kept them myself but know someone that had them in a 55 gallon tank. I always say the largest  tank you can afford is always the best choice. <br>  <br>  They grow to 4-5 inches and like clean water, and the bigger the tank the easier it is to maintain.<br>  <br>   Their dorsal and pectoral fins have lots of barbs on them so when you upsize don't use a net to catch them as they will snag and the attempted release could result in a torn net, torn off fins or even your own fingers in shreds. Use a jar instead.<br>  <br>   Good luck|`|H06PtiIAaa	pitcus catfish is a general name as there are alot of pictus catfish species.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking the ones at most LPS are spotted silver pitcus.

They are not a schooling catfish like cory's or like pet stores would lead you to believe they are. They are fairly hardy but need clean water, ammonia and Nitrites at 0 and Nitrates at 10 - 20.

UlOKMInqaa	Just because your friend's rat is calm and cuddly doesn't mean that every other rat will be. Your new rat may just be nervous since it is a new environment but some rats remain very active throughout the rest of their lives. Males tend to be more lazy but females like to be on the go. I have three females who would much rather be running around exploring than laying on my lap. Try giving your rat some tasty snacks like baby carrots or apply slices. Also, rats are social and are much happier with more of their own kind. If you can get another, you should. This could calm your rats nerves, as well.|`|hZLkzuuiaa	be patient. try to handle him for 10 - 15 minutes every day, around the same time every day. more handling when he is scared will just stress him out. you really just have to keep working with him and if you are patient and persistant it will pay off! offer treats to lure him out,and as rewards when he does what you want|`|aoSX3MEvaa	Please tell me you don't have ONE rat.

Same with rats. <br>  <br>  Please do your research about rats.

You need to be patient with him. For some rats, it takes time for them to trust you. Every rat has a different personality.<br>  Baby rats will generally want a bit of freedom to run around and explore the bed, to tunnel in blankets, and get their energy out, just like toddlers.<br>  Talk to him a lot and call him by his name so he will learn to recognize your voice and his name. Say his name when giving him treats and pet him with one finger, in small short strokes (similar to rats grooming another rat). When he is resting in his cage, slowly put one hand in while talking to him and lay your hand down beside him, without picking him up. Let him get used to your hand and know that it is a cuddly warm friend, not just something that plucks him up out of his safe home. <br>  Some of my most anxious and curious babies became the most affectionate and cuddly adults by using this method.
7i8ZKUQZaa	if hes not acting sick or has blood in her feces or throwin up i would say your kitty will be fine 22lbs is overweight for a cat she needed the exercise so its a good thing if she drops to much wieght i would consider changing the food to a different Iams product so you can change the food but shouldnt upset her stomach but if you switch do it a little at a time fade in the new food if you are really still concered then you should take her to the vet but i think she will be fine|`|AA12240925	Your cat sounds like it needed to lose the pounds. Better food combined with more activity will do that for any cat, person, dog, etc. If your cat seems happier and more energetic then why are you concerned? If it seems lethargic, weak, dehydrated, etc. then I would be worried but from what you describe, it sounds like after 4 months he's doing just fine (and could probably lose another 5 too.)|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi i don't think that 5 pounds in 4 months is too much.  As long as he is still eating and drinking normally and doesn't act like he is lethargic.  I think you're doing fine.|`|O1owwVXIaa	take ur cat to the vet and ask what is the best way for ur cat to lose weight and what is his ideal weight|`|aTZF7ey7aa	you should check to see if it needs worming if she/he has no worms take it to the vet immediately.|`|6AqdyWgzaa	Sounds like your cat is getting in shape and that takes discipline. Most cats go to health clubs and workout but if he can do it at home than you'll save a lot of money on cat gym memberships. Some of them are expensive like "Fur Ballys," or "24 hour Furryness." <br>  <br>  Or maybe your cat is gay for the dog. Interspecies relationships are more common these days so be open-minded so your cat can "come out" to you.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, The only thing I would worry about is bad teeth. That can cause a cat to stop eating but you would have noticed that probably. Just spend the money for the new wardrobe and encourage him to keep staying in shape.
EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, this is a problem and can become an even bigger problem if you don't do something about it now.  Separate the male budgie that is hurting the female.  Place him in a separate cage by himself.  You don't want any of your birds to end up injured or killed.  Budgies can easily get broken legs, have beaks torn off, or get pecked in the eye.  Please put an end to this violent behavior before it's too late.|`|MCmV7BOIaa	seperate them..either remove the male from the cage thats causing the problem and move him into his own cage or remove the female and put her into her own cage by herself..|`|UdHnRULiaa	separate them immediately|`|15JDwvRKaa	just like humans, birds fight, 2. there is nothing u can do because it is just apart of life...
GT6396BDaa	It does sound as though your dog is having anxiety episodes and some separation anxiety or fears of being alone issues.  I don't know the history, as far as how long you've had the dog, who owned it before you and when these "anxiety" episodes started with your dog.<br>  I know it's upsetting and frustrating when you know that something is wrong with your dog but you can't figure it out and unfortunately, your dog can't tell you what is bothering them.<br>  Has your dog always done this or did these episodes just start suddenly? The reason I ask is that if they just started recently, then it would be easier to figure out what may be the reason for them.<br>  Some dogs are just born with emotional problems.  Sometimes the breeding has something to do with it, whether it's inbreeding or not taking care in who or which dogs you decide to breed.  Of course breeders would never admith this, but it happens so many times.  If these episodes have always happened then that could be a reason. <br>  Some dogs, like people have these kind of problems for no apparent reason.  Some are just born with issues or problems that cannot be explained.<br>  If these episodes suddenly started, then something hapened to your dog.  Some reasons could be, that while you were out or at work something happened to startle or scare your dog.  A person or people like kids may have come around teasing or antagonizing your dog.  Or even bad storms, thunder, lightening, hail, strong winds can scare a dog, change their behavior or even  personality. <br>  When you told your vet about your dogs anxiety episodes, did he do a physical or at least do a complete blood work metabolic panel?   The reason I ask is because sometimes sudden behavior changes can be the result of an illness, such as liver disease or cancer.  Therefore, it is very important to have your dog thoroughly checked out.  <br>  Most likely, your dog something happened that affected your dog, where it wants to be close to you and gets anxious over things.  Usually, these things will get better and medications help.  I would still get your dog checked out thoroughly, just to be on the safe side.<br>  Best of luck.  Hope I helped.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Our male DDB does this.  He is "on guard" all the time.  He doesn't crawl into dark places, but he constantly paces and won't lie down in any one place for very long.  We crate him at night to force him to have a break and it's the only place he can really relax.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	I have to agree with the previous answer, this may be a physical problem rather than a problem of anxiety.  All the symptoms you mentioned can be signs of physical pain or distress, all can be common with bloat.  Obviously your dog didn't have a life-threatening episode of bloat, but he might be having some kind of problem with digestion, or other condition that is making him very uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  Add:  Dogs who may be susceptible to bloat, can have what is sometimes called a 'pre-bloat" where many of the same symptoms of trapped gas make them pace, unable to lie down, try to hide in unusual places, etc. <br>  <br>  What kind of dog is he?|`|7Rp256IOaa	I would start keeping track of when these episodes, note the environment, where was the dog, what was the weather like, was there any change in the environment?  You want to see if you can find a commonality so you can start addressing why your dog is acting this way.  Once you understand what is causing your dog to have these episodes you can work on changing his perception to that stimulus from one of fear to one of good things happen to me when this occurs!  You might also want to consider seeing a vet behaviorist.  Its not healthy for a dog to be that stressed out.  It could lead to physical problems if not addressed.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi check out this site on the internet Caesar Milan The Dog Whisperer he has a whole big web site and many books and DVD's you can get to help with any dog problem you have.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	Mine always did that during a thunderfstorm..I would think twice about the benadryl..  That stuff makes me anxious and nervous.|`|cY4vg9VAaa	Did the  Vet prescribed the anti anxiety medicine? If not, and you're given him human meds, that is very bad for him, especially benadryl!!!! Benadryl has a chemical that dogs react negatively to. Try to find out the source of his anxiety and treat him accordingly. Is it loud noises? Thunder? Being alone? You can treat him behaviorally rather than medically. Like I said, unless the Vet prescribed him something, don't give him anything.|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	I just did a search for "restless dog" and the first thing that came up was something about "21 symptoms you should never ignore in your dog". <br>  <br>  Going through the list, which does include what you've mentioned, some of the possible causes this website lists are: bloat, fluid in the lungs, pain or general discomfort, or problems with the heart. If they're listing general pain as a cause for the abnormal behavior you're listing, your pet could have one of a long list of chronic illnesses. <br>  <br>  As a dog owner, my suggestion would be to get a second oppinion.  Depending on where you live, sometimes the animal shelters will do a free or low cost evaluation ("check-up"). <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your pooch.|`|j1TfV1u2aa	It sounds stupid but try giving it an old shirt of yours.  Sometimes just your smell will calm your dog down.  My husband had a mini dashound, she was very restless in the car: couldn't  seem to get comfortable, panteing, ect.  We use to bring a shirt of his and give it to her, she would lay down in the back seat and go to sleep!  Try giving it and old shirt of yours and see if it works for you too!

2eJcaeOPaa	have the vet check his anal glands|`|W0ZQQK4taa	Your dog might need his anal glands expressed, take him to the vet's or groomer's and have them do it.|`|AA11244754	That's how dogs express their anal glands and it's completely normal.  Now if he keeps doing it you need to get him to the vet so they can do it for him.|`|cY4vg9VAaa	Was he tested for all types of intestinal worms? Also, worms have what we call a prepatent period-the time between which the animal is infected and the time that we see signs of an infestation. You might have gotten him tested too early, before any signs of an infestation occurs.<br>  <br>  Also, his anal glands might be bothering him. Did your vet express them? If he's rubbing his butt along the floor, that may be a sign he's trying to express them himself.|`|wlxuCXSzaa	what breed is he? Smaller dogs seem to have a little more trouble with anal glands? Familiar with those? :)<br>  Some times if they need to be drained the dog will do the booty scoot thing. But my chihuahua is very particular about having her bottom clean after she poops. Not trying to be gross, but usually if she is having any trouble getting the last bit off she will drag her booty. But it's not due to anal gland problems, its just cause she wants it off. <br>  If he is just doing it occasionally, probably the same thing as my dog. If he is doing it several times a day, I would have the vet drain his glands. Good Luck!!|`|a0EeYueWaa	try wiping him. my dog sometimes does that. if it continues a lot even if you wipe him, see a vet to check if anything's wrong.
TphsSOz6aa	You have an outgoing, affectionate cat.  He's also brave, playful, and has hunting skills.  He's everything a cat should be.  When he's in "attack kitty " mode, just be glad he's not a tiger, like got Roy, of Sigfreid and Roy.  <br>  <br>  You got him neutered , that's good.  You let him outside to play and hunt and exercise....while some people hate that...cats really love it.  <br>  <br>  So, enjoy your little tiger.  He'll mellow with age.

You have to reward them for good behaviour and ignore them when they behave in an undesirable way. As for your bin - make sure he can't get in the room. Don't leave food out for him to scavenge, and don't give him any human food no matter how much he begs. It's very bad for him. <br>  <br>  Ask your vet for advice and if you can't solve the problem, get an animal psychologist in.

8da67ac25bf0b572bff8917067bcb303aa	First you need to find out what shots she has had so far.  If she hasn't had her shots this year she will need those.  Go to your vet and they will tell you the shots she needs and will give you her tag.  I'm not sure if they will have collars but any grocery or pet store will have these.  Our local pet store offers a pet care clinic which is less expensive than a vet and you can get your pets licensed here as well.  It won't cost very much just for a rabies shot.  I know the vets don't recommend this but if your cat stays inside all the time and never goes outside you don't need to get the rabies shot every year.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If you are talking about a purebred, you cannot just register her unless you have the registration papers from the breeder/owner.  The associations that are mainly used in the US are CFA, ACFA, or TICA (there are a few others).<br>  <br>  If the cat is "registered" from CKC or APRI, etc. - they are worthless puppy/kitten mill and backyard breeders associations and don't mean anything.<br>  <br>  Where do you want to register her?|`|xgKQrEhqaa	Usually vets can take care of this or tell you how to (you may have to go to the local shelter or to city hall as well, but the vet will direct you if you have to).  Some areas don't require registration either, but best to check.  Most cities regulations require them to have certain shots first, most common the rabies shot.  Also micro-chipping is a way to register them on line to help with lost and found and to make sure females aren't unnecessarily "spayed again".  Some vets will "tattoo" a female in the surgical area though.  Collar and tag can be picked up at a pet store, but doesn't necessarily register them.  Make sure with the collar that it is a break away kind (cats will strangle themselves otherwise).  Which kind of makes a collar a little useless.  But keep in mind that some studies have shown micro-chipping as causing cancer so toss up, I'm not a vet or doctor to know the validity of the studies talk to your vet about the concern and you can decide that one.  As for price it all depends on where you live...  I micro-chipped my 2 for $18 each.  Shots in central Oregon were $10, in the remote mountains of california $55 go figure.  Pet licensing again depends on whether the city wants to gauge the pet lovers or they are looking to just fund the local shelter.
qeOlkRM0aa	Its not a good idea. Its called inbreeding. There may be defects, but more likely there will be health issues that are initially invisible.I strongly recommend against it.|`|1omgPICKaa	Are you asking if brother and sister javas can have healthy offspring?<br>  <br>  Before I answer, I just want to strongly reccomend that you don't purposefully pair related birds off. It weakens and taints their blood line and can produce disfigured, unhealthy, and sick offspring.<br>  <br>  However, most incest birds will appear healthy on the outside and live a normal life. So yes, java finches can produce normal birds. On the inside though, is another matter. If you start pairing the incest birds off, especially with even more relatives (their parents, siblings, grandparents) the chance of producing disfigured babies becomes more and more common.<br>  <br>  Having defected chicks from related parents is certainly not uncommon, but most will come out okay.
sQOXjKFNaa	60-65 days|`|oi66N5QYaa	Don't even think about it.  Breeding your dog is<br>  adding to a huge population of dogs<br>  that already need homes. Get the dog<br>  spayed.

UeOtjPP5aa	Ideally, you should wait until the rabbits are about 6 months before starting veggies in their diet. Parsley, cilantro, romaine lettuce, basil, and oregano are good, bunny-safe veggies and herbs. Feed sugary fruits such as apples, strawberries, bananas, carrots, and blueberries as treats only, and no more than 3 times a week.<br>  <br>  Once they hit 6 months, fresh veggies and herbs should slowly become a major portion of your rabbits' diet.|`|m0A12ctUaa	No carrots until they are one year old<br>  <br>  Only small amoutns at first (especially apple and pear, to much can cause diarrhea)<br>  <br>  You can start feeding them now but NOT to much, strwberries, blueberries, and raspberries at first them them parsnip, parsley, borccoli, DARK lettuce (never light/white), zucchini, cucumbers (without peel) <br>  <br>  But NEVER EVER feed:<br>  eggplant<br>  advocado legumes radishes soybeans leeks ornamental gourds onions rhubarb spinach<br>  raw potatoes<br>  potatoe leaves <br>  green tomatoes<br>  tomato leavs<br>  raw beans<br>  <br>  Hop I could help :) Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  and remeber HAY IS ESSENTIAL|`|JuJj7HaDaa	Ideally, never really. Only as tidbits and small snacks. The idea that rabbits eat carrots makes many pushed to feed them to their little bunny. In reality, too much fruit or vegetables will give your rabbit an upset stomach. Small pieces, such as a slice of apple, or a circle of carrot, is fine, but many bunnies have a very sensitive stomach, and even this can upset it.<br>  <br>  I would wait until they are at least 6 months old, and they have matured slightly, and try small pieces. You can also buy rabbit treats from a pet store; there are many different types( even rabbit chocolate!), and many chew bars to hook onto their cage door. Alfalfa is also a great treat for them.<br>  <br>  x
XI2iylR4aa	I think it's wonderful that you're going to take care of this poor bunny.<br>  <br>  I've read a lot about shy/scared bunnies.  This article is a great place to start:<br>  <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/shybun.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/shybun.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Here are a few tips that might be useful (these are probably in the article, but they have also worked for me personally):<br>  <br>  Spend as much time as you can in the room with him.  Just get him used to your presence.  Get him used to your voice.  Talk on the phone in the same room as him, etc.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of holding a sprig of parsley or another fragrant herb and letting him come to you. When you sit on the floor, do you talk to him while he comes to you?  Or do you just sit quietly and still?  I suggest you talk to him, to make sure he knows you're there.  If you're just sitting there, motionless, and then he's up close to you and you suddenly move, he might see that as a predatory thing.  So if you can talk to him, that lets him know that you're there.<br>  <br>  Some important things to remember:  Rabbits have pretty poor eyesight up close, so if he's close to you and you suddenly move, he will likely get scared and box or run away.<br>  <br>  It's best to engage at least two of their senses.  When we first got our scared bun, we were instructed to make a little sound with our hand (like rubbing our thumb against our fingertips) as we put our hands near our bun. That way, if she couldn't see us, she could at least hear us.<br>  <br>  I have a little bit of experience with scared/aggressive rabbits, but there are quite a few experts out there who have socialized and rehabilitated many rabbits.<br>  <br>  I would start with this list:<br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/hrs-info/contacts.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/hrs-info/contacts.html</a><br>  <br>  And contact a few people who are close to your location.  I'm sure that you'll find someone who can answer any specific questions you have, and give you some tips.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your new bun.  It will take time, but once he trusts you, I think he will be thankful for all that you have done for him.|`|meMF69tXaa	Congrats on getting a new rabbit. <br>  <br>  I have two does that were rescues and both were living in horrible conditions outdoors when I got them. Neither had been socialized and the poor little buns were frightened over everything.<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to be patient. Also, it's good to approach your rabbit slowly when you are playing, feeding and handling him. Sudden movements can frighten your rabbit. Try speaking to your rabbit in a soft voice, also. Never hold your rabbit by the scruff and always support his hind legs/back when holding him.<br>  <br>  You may also want to try a smaller area when trying to be more social with your rabbit. I used my bathroom at first and then moved on to the play area and larger areas of our home. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YDtSz60oaa	Treats are a good way to get a rabbit used to you, its helped me with all my rabbits in the past. Mine are particularly fond of fresh parsley. <br>  Another thing I've fond, is that laying on the floor seems to make them more comfortable, maybe because you're closer to their height, so they don't feel as threatened.<br>  In any case it will probably take a long time to get him to feel secure, just don't give up.|`|LX4TFIakaa	I also have a rabbit who used to be very scared, I let him in the house all the time to get uesd to humans. Always make sure u dont walk upto them as they feel intimidated. If you are going to approach him make sure u crawl over to him and dont move your hand over his head as he wont know what you are going to do, go in sideways if that makes sense, this always works with my rabbit. Make sure if you manage to pick him up that he is facing you and all of his paws are secure. Hope this helps.

VDP3pNCPaa	That was a very long time ago, and IAMS dry food was not implicated in the recall.<br>  <br>  If your cat just died now, I simply don't believe you that it was a result of any IAMS wet cat food.

It has gotten so far out of control that we are usually making all our own food at home from scratch. As far as cat food goes, we pay a premium price for the ones that are natural, organic and human grade, like Wellness, Natural Balance, Evo and others.<br>  <br>  I know that a lot of people probably think Iams is good, because it is or used to be promoted by some vets.

Unless your vet backs up the claim via an autopsy as to what the cause was, you really can't shout this out over the internet.  You need to have proof.<br>  <br>  Mine has kidney failure as an ongoing thing for the past 3 years. He gets a blend of 4 different foods plus raw and some cooked meats.  He's 18, his system is slowing down and the kidney failure is part of normal aging.
2qgg2G8kaa	I don't believe he's sick. Ball pythons are not always active during the day. After a feeding they may not come out at night. I don't really understand what you mean by "laying" but I assume you mean just sitting in one spot. Ball pythons are not active snake, but do like do run around and are curious. They aren't jittery and fast like corn snakes and king snakes. Pythons and boas are more of a "chill" snake. They do not jump around like corn snakes and king snakes. I don't think your ball python is sick though. The good thing is that it is eating, so you have a snake that feeds well which is great. Just make sure your snake keeps eating. Also take the snake out and see if it will move around when you are holding it.|`|J5P0o8KPaa	Its not uncommon for a snake to just lay around for days at a time. Do you have a heat source for him snakes digest their food as well as regulate their temperature with heat and if the meal doesn't digest properly it can begin to rot inside the snakes stomach. Another thing to look for is how often your snake expells waste. You should not feed your snake until he's gotten rid of his last meal. Are you feeding him live or killed prey ? live prey can injure you're snake and an injured snake will not be as active as a healthy snake. also does your snake have a place to hide? A hide is important to make your snake feel more secure and will encourage movement at night.|`|pxqPEm9Aaa	Snakes are nocturnal.<br>  They will not be roaming that much during the day, or night at that...<br>  <br>  He might be going into shed, check for a pink belly, and clouded eyes. They normal become alot more inactive during this period.|`|atxog9hFaa	Snakes have to have time to digest. He is just laying there because that rat will take time to digest. He can't move, because he will regurgitate it because the stomach muscles will contract.|`|b9610cdca9c953260b26bc2dd476eab7aa	first off have you done any research ? your feeding him 2 much and thats what they do they lay there..do some research dont risk making him sick...learn about feeding..caging...humidity..water..light...
aCqSF87Raa	I would check your local shelter fees and make your decision based on that. It's possible that she is asking for a smaller amount OR she may be asking for the same: however if the shelters are only asking for, say, $75 for a puppy of that breed (or similar breed size) then you may be able to haggle with her on the price.<br>  <br>  I personally wouldn't pay her that much considering the dogs are mutts, probably not health tested, and she probably has no health guarantee.<br>  <br>  The pup should probably also have it's first set of shots (DHLPP 5-in-1 or 7-in-1.) I believe they get that (or are supposed to) in between seven and eight weeks.|`|AA10847265	You can spend as much or as little as you want on a dog.  Is she asking too much?  Probably, but if someone is willing to pay that much why shouldn't she. The pup should get its first shot as soon as possible to protect against the biggies like Parvo and Distemper.  If you are really interested in these pups make sure that the parents are on site and that you look at them closely.  Temperment is passed on to the pups and things like poor skin, bad hips, and more is also heritable.  Make sure that the pup you choose has clear eyes, pigmentation on the second eyelid, a nice tight bite, and a good coat.  If you are going to spend that much on a dog, make sure that it is healthy and has the prospect of having a nice temperment.  Good luck.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	if you dont care that the dog is pure bred,please consider a shelter,they usually have their dogs not only spay/neutered,but with shots and wormers,health screened and my sisters pup that came from a shelter has a 30 day vet insurance thing,and you would be saving a life,dont buy any of these puppies,that is a ridiculous price...|`|OyJOPmHvaa	That is a ot for a non pedigree puppy, you could try dog rescue you will find one much cheaper there and they have puppies, if you want to pay a lot of money then you need papers, sorry but this lady is trying to rip you off. Sorry.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I agree, that's a lot of money for a mix-breed puppy.  I guess the BYB will get what ever the market will give.  I would look elsewhere.|`|rctF3Ylxaa	Please go to atlanta pet rescue or atlanta humane scocioty or something! These poor animals will be killed if someone doesent step up and adopt them! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At least give them a chance!|`|6qsocyK3aa	I agree. Ask her to lower the price or threaten to look elsewhere.|`|62hGVNhoaa	I've seen Border Collie pups advertised in the local papers for much less than that, last ones were ￡100.<br>  If you don't mind a BC cross, go to a shelter, BC x Lab or GS is one of the most common dogs in rescue centres.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but I was thinking that was a lot of money for a mix, when you could get a pure bred for about that much.  I wouldn't buy it either because it should at least have its first injections.  This just doesn't sound right to me, I think you should pass on this one.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	You can get a mutt puppy for a lot cheaper by going to a shelter and picking one out.|`|2O58btqxaa	it is a lot of money u can get a pedigree dog for that price hun  dont do it where abouts are u?|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Way to much!

Rw7gi86Naa	Since you have time in advance, you should start out with swapping scents. This will help the cats get acquainted with each other's scents before they meet. Use a small towel and wipe your cat down with it. Bring it to your boyfriend's house and set it very casually on the floor, (don't bring cats to the towel like you're showing them, let them find it on their own). Leave the towel around for several days, and even bring more clothing items with her scent. Do the same with both of the male cats and leave those towels around your house. Place them in several places in the same way you “planted” the first one.  <br>  <br>  You didn't mention who is going to be moving in where so let’s just say you are moving in to his place. Have your boyfriend distract his cats, while you sneak your cat in and put her or her in a room with the door closed.  You can set up her food and water dishes and a litter box in her room.  Include toys and a bed, (or just a box with towels).  The litter box should be in the opposite side of the room from the food, water and bed.  Do not set up her room before you bring her home.  This will only confuse his cats.  The point is to make his cats think that your cat suddenly (and magically!) appeared, without your knowledge.<br>  <br>  His cats will approach the door and pick up on her scent.  Don’t get discouraged or worried if you hear some hissing and growling, as this is very common.  For the first couple days, spend a limited time in the room with the kitten and make sure to give your resident cats plenty of affection, even more than usual. Another helpful thing to try is to attach two toys with a string, and leave them on opposite sides of the door, so the cats can play together. <br>  <br>  Cats are very territorial animals, and this is why you don’t want them to see your cat as an intruder that YOU brought home and shoved in their faces.  Cats are very much creatures of habit and routine, so when their routine is disrupted, don’t be surprised if they become very angry.  You must be the judge of when they should meet face-to-face, but don’t push things too quickly, it may take a few days of sniffing each other under the door before they have settled down.  When you believe they have calmed down and are ready, casually open the door a few inches.  Remember, you are being nonchalant about this; do not force them on each other.  You should pick a time after all of the cats have just eaten; feed them a treat that you know they will love, (like some of their favorite cooked meat).  They will be content and their bellies will be full, so they’re less likely to want to exert a lot of energy in a cat fight.  Supervise them and don’t be surprised if they put up a fight.  Don’t step in and separate them unless someone’s getting hurt worse than just a scratch on the nose. Your cat will probably retreat into her room at which time you should close the door.  Increase the time you allow them to interact each day.  Don’t leave them together unattended until you are confident that they comfortable with each other.  Be patient.  It may take a few weeks or even a few months, but if all goes well they will soon become the best of friends.<br>  <br>  Extra tip: to ease the initial tension of introduction, rub each cat down with brewer's yeast powder. Brewer's yeast is available in natural food stores. It's all natural, full of vitamin B, and will actually go good for the cats to lick it off. The smell of the brewer’s yeast helps disguise the foreign odors and each cat will basically smell the same. Don't use anything like baby powder because the talc isn't good for the cat to breathe or ingest. You should use the same grooming tools (combs, brushes, towels, mitts) on both cats to transfer their scents to one another.<br>  <br>  Please also make sure that each cat is neutered before they meet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zpwJR60baa	As long you have the male fixed, and do the proper introduction. <br>  <br>  Here are great link from SF SPCA... on confinement and cat to cat introduction...|`|UBS4jIAcaa	selotape their tales together!|`|I5RuJPONaa	Yes, they HAVE to be neutered! Otherwise, it will NOT work smoothly.<br>  The best way is to confine them to separate areas, I know it seems hard, but it will definitely be well worth the trouble in the end. There's nothing worse than rivaling cats.<br>  Allow short periods of them being able to sniff each other's face only. (like thru the crack of a door) they will have a curiosity to get aquainted, and it won't be forced on them. Gradually, allow supervised time together, then you will see when they're ready for a permanent home sharing.|`|AA10892706	this is kinda cool...maybe you shouldn't do it the very first time though...get some type of light body spray or whatever and spray it on all 3 of the cats - that way, they will all smell the same and it may decrease the problems that come with intergrating 2 cat households.

Next time try not to step in between a dog fight! number 1 sin! :)|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi when anyone is bitten by a dog they need to see a md if the skin broken and blood is drawn in the area.  Dog bites can get infected as their mouths are dirty.   Also you need to find out if the dog has it's rabies shot and is current.  You also need to call the humane society and let them know as the dog needs to be quarantined for ten days.  They always do that after a person is bitten by a dog.  Just to make sure.  It's a hard lesson learned and that happened to my friend she tried to separate her two big dogs that were fighting and she got bit.  There is the neatest thing that i bought for dogs who bark or fight etc.  it is out of the Dr.Leonards catalog and it is a little blue contraption about 4" long and 2 1/2" wide and has a button you push on it.  What it does is emits a high frequency sound that actually only the dog hears it and it chases them away or stops them from barking.  And it does work.  I knew of a lady that tried to get her two dogs apart that were fighting and she got bid really bad and it damaged the nerve in her hand for life.  So be very careful when dogs are fighting.  The best thing to do is to take a water hose or pick up a stick or something but try not to ever grab a hold of them.  In the heat of a fight even you're own dog will bite you.  But i would go to the clinic and have them check it out.  If you are not current on tetanus shot you need to get one right away within 24 hours.|`|of4Ieho2aa	no biggie tip if you were at your house you would of just got the hose and separate them|`|2O58btqxaa	ask ur doctor u may need a shot

KEYgd73saa	Rainbow Sharks are NOT peaceful.  In fact, they are extremely aggressive, particularly to their own species, but also to anything that will near its territory.  Anything that goes anywhere near the tank floor is at risk of getting attacked.  The Guppies, Platies, and Goldfish are all at risk-- Tetras usually have the sense to stay high enough in the water column to avoid it.  Guppies and Platies are frankly not very smart fish, and will be the first to go-- I had a Molly that was torn apart over night by a Rainbow.  The Goldfish are entirely out of place-- they need cold water (below 72*), and will get about a foot long (assuming you have the common type; if you've got a fancy type, expect it to get about 6").  And, as Goldfish have no sense of territories, it will get absolutely destroyed... maybe not immediately, but in the next couple weeks.  I'd strongly suggest you take back the Shark and find a new home for the Goldfish, as neither are going to work in that tank.|`|xeIhcXoCaa	the rainbow shark is a very peacefull shark you should not have a problem at all. they are cool fish arnt they.
5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Does your filter have a flow control on it?  Turn the flow down if you can.  If not, i'm sure your goldfish will get used to it or aviod that area of the tank.   My goldfish prefer the flakes over the pellets.|`|ECvEknqtaa	i think you should lower speed or power ot the filter so that it will be easier for the goldfish. my goldfish used to do that aswell i got a new filter that had the power thing i could turn it higher and lower which was a good thing. i fed my goldfish flakes and i think it is much better than pellets. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: if your fish gets sucked then you HAVE to change thf ilter or lower the power down. it shouldnt get sucked like that. <br>  if he isnt eating then try the pellets. but im not sure. maybe the vet. gd luck|`|AorhZF06aa	i think most goldfish like steak.

0zZZHXvVaa	no you dont need to change the media aswell just change the sponge every 4 - 6 weeks i have the same tank as you|`|356c35039bea626fe1d313ddc7264fc7aa	Just follow the instructions to your filter and use the proper replacements.   You should be just fine in replacing the filther.|`|aeonmRR2aa	Rinse it in tank water (which you then throw away) when it becomes clogged.  Never replace filter media until it starts to fall apart, or you can't get it clean anymore.  Sponges almost never need to be replaced - they can last years.  Carbon needs to be replaced only after you medicate a tank, and it's only 'active' for a few days.  Don't bother with chemical filtration unless you have a specific problem that calls for it - it's a marketing gimmick and useless 90% of the time.<br>  <br>  When you replace filter media (or wash it with soap and tapwater, or bleach, etc), you lose all the beneficial bacteria growing on it and your tank system may collapse from an ammonia overload.  Used filter media, therefore, is better than new.
IrdZKYT3aa	I asked about clams a while ago, and was doing a lot of research on them when I was considering a few.  However the response was unanimous, not a good idea.  They have a tendency to bury themselves and die, slowly rotting and poisoning the aquariums water. <br>  There's a ton of bad stories on the net about them disappearing and dying.  Keep a close eye on them, perhaps dig them up every other day or so to see if they're still with you. Some people suggested using a turkey baster and giving them brine shrimp right nest to them, or some sort of liquid clam food to help suppelment thier diet.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|h4wNRqf9aa	greg... you realize there MORE than ONE species of clam in the world right?<br>  <br>  the kind you can keep in your tank are NOT the same kind getting muscled out (excuse the pun) by zebra mussels in canada<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i agree with cherry that you need to feed them near constantly or they WILL die|`|d0ee85442ce5191c782fef3b8ab2dfb0aa	Where did you get the clams???<br>  In must states its not legal to have them ..

You'll have to grow them yourself - search for 'green water recipe' or 'infusoria recipe'.  Fish breeding websites are full of advice because fry eat plankton, too.  The water should be alkaline and somewhat hard for clams, which is fine since your other fish like those conditions.<br>  <br>  Normally, green water is grown from water with houseplant fertilizer left in the sun with a bubbler in it, and infusoria from water left in a warm place with shredded lettuce or hay in it, but there are many recipes for each.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how clams will like a UGF.  Be sure the substrate is thick enough on top for them to move around.  20 pounds is not enough, and pea-sized is bigger than ideal.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.  If you really want clams...  in a 29-gallon tank, 1 is probably better than 2.

6pdwd3PZaa	This is very serious. She more than likely has an overgrowth of bad bacteria in her stomach. If she does not get on meds ASAP she will die from dehydration. I have a chocolate lab and she did the exact same thing last summer (had accidents in the house when she NEVER does this). Her going into your room is a sign she is trying to hide it from you by not going in her usual places. She is embarrassed because she cannot hold it. It will not cost that much to get her tested at the vet. The entire treatment costs me $100 last year and she got better.<br>  GET HER TO THE VET TODAY!|`|AA12128656	your dog is ILL and needs to go to the VET!!<br>  <br>  blood in stool is indicative of internal BLEEDING! <br>  <br>  get off your computer and go to the vet NOW!!!!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I would take her to the vets now.  There is a new strain of parvo going around and by the time the symptoms show up it is usually too late.

Good luck|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	Blood is always a bad sign. You may go ahead and take her to the vet ASAP.  There are alot of things that can go wrong with dogs.

P8RLUKrbaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  Aww this sounds to me like a lonely cavy, I think as he's wheeking when the others do he needs a friend. But get one that is around the same age so that they can grow up together. Be careful introducing them though because it can all to quickly turn nasty. If you really don't want to but another can you put his cage as close as possible to the others so that he can listen to them and know their are other cavies around. I would buy another though. Poor little Piggie =(.<br>  <br>  Ava xxx|`|cb5fKlRCaa	he probably misses his old home as hes just a baby and maybe his mum was with him where ever you got him .he just needs time to settle in .keep handling him to show him he is safe.the older guinea pigs should comfort him if not maybe you should consider buying another baby guinea pig or 1 that was in the cage with him when you got him ,,hope this helps good luck to you and your new Guinea pig ,keep us updated and tell us how hes getting on,maybe pics?whats his name ? hope this helps ,,meg x|`|a193b0793e7a03094639e76b99ad9e23aa	yes the latter.give him time to settle in.  the others are all strangers to him so he is prob scared but im sure all will be fine soon<br>  if he is eating and drinking then dont worry too much|`|2F8MGbbqaa	Guinea pigs are social animals, they are like humans, if we are on our own all the time, we get lonely. And especially if he is just a baby, he wants someone to cuddle up to and keep him company. I would say the no movement is just because he's scared because it's all new to him and is a new environment. For the first week, you should let him settle in (with another guinea pig!) so he gets used to all the smells and sounds and feels more comfortable, then when he seems like he's getting used to everything, then you should start handling him. If you are scared how the pigs will react together, buy some lavender drops, and put a few drops on each of the guinea pigs so they both smell the same and then there will be no fights or anything. <br>  <br>  You really, really need to give him a friend though because any guinea pig needs company and especially a new baby! Good luck :)|`|lNfv18Bsaa	It could be a mixture of both. You could wait a bit until he's more settled in and then see if he seems lonely.|`|juyA6HUJaa	Well guinea pigs are meant to be kept in pairs so that could be why but you only got him yesterday, in the wild they're prey so it takes a long time for them to learn you wont hurt them, I've had mine a few weeks now and he's only just starting to stop being shy. Make sure his cage is big enough and that he's healthy, he'll just be scared and missing his friends as they're herd animals and not meant to be kept alone.
NAGiNKFWaa	At this age, I have the crate by the bed, with a night light on so the puppy can see me and be reassured.  I might play a cd or radio just to get him to sleep.  He can only hold his potty for 2 or 3 hours, so set a timer or alarm and get up and take him potty.  Don't use the newspaper, puppies don't know the difference between paper and carpet.  If he cries, don't engage him or he will continue, that is tough, but if he can see you, he won't feel abandoned.  He doesn't have to sleep in the bedroom forever, just until he is potty trained.  here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|6t5kQnSFaa	For house breaking I HIGHLY recommend crate training. A crate provides a pup with a safe place to sleep AND a dog will do absolutely everything in his power to not go to the bathroom where they sleep/live.<br>  <br>  The crate should only be big enough for him to stand/turn around/ lay down in and as for the crying at night thing. In a way it's a dominance test. <br>  <br>  A pack leader would not answer the cries. The leader gets up when the leader gets up. However, he's a puppy and they can only hold it for so long. We would get up every 3-4 hours in the beginning. It's tough to ignore the crying - it pulls at your heartstrings, but if you get up each time he cries he'll learn to do it. So now, not only when he was to pee, but also when he's bored, or he wants to see you...etc.|`|KLMWlQ9Raa	Dogs will not go potty where they sleep as a general rule.  Yes, I am a firm believer in the crate thing.  It serves a multitude of happy things 4 the puppy.  It may take a while.  Kudo's to the breeder for paper training, but as I told my lab mix when he was 12wks old, when you get over 50#, you are going to look mighty strange doing that.  He took to the crate just beautifully.  As to whether or not you will know if he needs to go potty while in the crate, while they are this little, it's anyone guess.  If they are crying, take them out, let them at least have the opportunity to do their thing & put him back.  Good Luck
AA12128656	you need to train her to do something else to replace the behavior. <br>  <br>  i have trained my pit bull terrier to bark three times and then run into her crate and lay down for a cookie. <br>  it takes practice, and you need to do it EVERY TIME that someone knocks! it is best to have a helper to practice until the dog understands what you want it to do.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	I would actually try knocking randomly and when she does bark say "its ok" in a calm voice and distract her by getting her to sit. If you yell, they just think you are joining in. It will take time. Be consistent and eventually she will stop. This may help, its how I got my girl to stop barking. In obedience class, my trainer suggested to someone to actually teach your dog to speak on command. You teach it, but never use it. I don't know if it would work because I never tried it, but it apparently worked for the woman it was suggested to.|`|SQs1aiIIaa	well what you could try is when she  barks try to discipline the dog, but you don't want to hurt the dog you just want to get your point across, that she cant always be barking, when there is no need for her to be barking also when someone knocks and she does not bark reward her with like a dog treat or a new toy or something.|`|pgAh5kdlaa	If I was you, I would try a bark control collar.<br>  You can find one here...<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ultimatebarkcontrol.com/?gclid=CJ_gmsvVlpkCFQu-Ggod1FuMbQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatebarkcontrol.com/?gcli...</a>
yQiC58bHaa	Dogs will usually come into heat at about 6 months of age, although it can be younger. Some, however, don't have their first heat cycle until they're a year or a little over, although it's pretty rare. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't come into heat within a couple of months I'd take her over to your vet's to get her checked out, just to make sure nothing's wrong. ^^|`|bIaywrBCaa	Since she is a yr old already she could come in heat at any time. Usually most dogs will come in heat before a year but dogs do not go by a schedule.|`|6qsocyK3aa	A dog can first come into heat aged six months but obviously your dog is older than that. It could happen any time. Maybe her tiredness has something to do with it. I would ask your vet.<br>  <br>  If you do plan to breed, please please please please think very carefully about it. She needs to be KC registered (with a valid KC certificate) as does her sire, have her DNA tested for faulty genetics as does her sire, win breed championships to prove she is an exemplary example of her breed as does her sire and have her hips/elbows tested as does her sire. You also need to be able to financially afford a dog pregnancy including the cost of a possible c-section and of course all the puppies vaccinations and worming/flea treatment. Also, remember that with every heat your dog goes into she has an increased chance of developing certain cancers.|`|RPZyku2Jaa	Most dogs should have their first heat around 6 months of age - at a year, your ***** is pretty late.  And you do not breed a dog after several years of owning it - no dog should be bred after 5 years of age.  You need to do a lot more research and find yourself a breeding mentor before you are ready to breed your dog.  It is not something you do just for fun.  Please spay your dog.|`|F4rCjV1haa	They normally come in to heat a 6 to 8 month. You might want to have a vet take a look at her.To make sure that she is ok.|`|8FJfuy3jaa	It is a possibility usually females don't go into heat until they are full grown and have reached maturity which is around two years old.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	1. She may be pregnant now.  Have her checked.  If you let her outside by herself at any time, it's possible she got bred.  Being as you really don't know much about heat cycles, it's possible she was in heat already, and you didn't know it.  Sometimes dogs have what's called silent heats.  Meaning no blood, but can still get pregnant.<br>  <br>  2. In several years she will be too old to breed.  Dogs should only be bred between the ages of 2 and 5, and should be Champion Titled before breeding.  Have her spayed.|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	Dogs can come into season anytime after 6 months old, so it's hard to guess when a dog will exactly have their first heat.<br>  <br>  You are on the right path with hips and elbows being checked before breeding, but make sure you follow up with other testing to make sure your dog is clear of any genetic maladies she could pass off to her offspring (retinal atrophy, certain heart conditions prevalent in labs, etc.).<br>  <br>  Most importantly make sure you show your dog in conformation classes to be sure she is up to the breed standard.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You say she has "she has an award winning lineage and if I did breed her I would do so very responsibly."  I'm going to assume that means the breeder told you "champion bloodlines" which is basically worthless.  Most purebred dogs will have champions in their lineage but if it's not from the immediate bloodline (parents/ full siblings) it's really worthless.  I'm not attacking you I'm just try to clear up a misconception many backyard breeders use to sell you a puppy.  It makes many inexperienced buyers feel like they are getting a quality pup that is worth a lot of money but it really doesn't mean anything in relation to what you are actually buying.
hetZz4c1aa	At 5 months your girl should be spayed, so it's time to set up an appointment.  Your vet will be happy to give you advise about the proper diet for her after she has the surgery.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	She can be put on adult foods now.  I only feed kitten food for the first 5 months - then they are changed over to adult foods.  Unless the kitten is sick or a large breed, then it doesn't need kitten food past 5 months old.<br>  <br>  Do a gradual change to adult food now (hope you are feeding canned and dry).  And be sure she is spayed too - kittens should be done at age 3-4 months before they come into heat.<br>  <br>  As far as age to adult - usually one year is consider an adult (8 months for show purposes) - but kittens do NOT need kitten food for a year!|`|0mb78CiWaa	It is best to put her on adult food when she is a year old. That is when they are considered adults.|`|4D7nhSHnaa	While they are still kittens, Kitty Foods are suppose to have all the nutrients needed for a kitten to grow into a healthy cat.  I have not been a kitten Mom very long (8 months 2 b exact, lol), but after rescuing my Bradley, I did my research, reached out to anything/everything cats to learn how to properly take care of him. And feeding kittens kitty foods until the age of one is what I learned.  Food for kittens are supposed to have more of the things to make their little bodies strong before moving on to adult food.|`|QC6oBb2iaa	Most cats should be switched to adult food at around a year old.  Larger breeds, like Maine Coons, don't fully mature until the age of two, so should get kitten food until then.|`|QRBi7feQaa	start the cat on dry food now unless the vet has told u not secondly get the cat fixed if u havent already done so they handle it better when they r younger|`|NvTaqSC5aa	When my cat turned 1 year old my father started to give her adult cat food and she is perfectly fine and is better with it now so I'd give your kitten adult cat food when in 7 months!
Rw7gi86Naa	If his paws are filthy, then the litter box needs to be cleaned more. I'm a bit puzzled about him getting it all over his back, though. You can't necessarily "teach" a cat better litter box habits because he learned from his mother. Most kittens are messy in the litter box, but they will usually grow out it it. Dominant cats tend to not cover their poop, and I have yet to find a solution for that. <br>  <br>  Always scoop litter boxes at least once a day, and change the litter at least once a week.  When cleaning the box, use a mild detergent and finish by rinsing thoroughly with very hot water.  Never use strong-smelling pine cleansers, bleach or ammonia.  Rinsing the box with boiling water is also effective.  With covered litter boxes, the smell can be worse, especially with high humidity, so you must be willing to clean it more. You could also try having two litter boxes available for him instead of one.|`|2wdVqIc7aa	When he goes to the box, go with him and watch. You have to be his mama and help him not get all dirty. Pick him up when he is about to walk in it and put him down beside it and lift his foot and help him scratch to cover the pee/poop. He will learn better habits by doing them.|`|59964a018492ed365416a5a4322c2588aa	First I would see if the box is big enough, maybe he needs more room? If he is a kitten he will get better as he gets older.

The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Every hour on the hour the pup needs to go out at first. Also, about 20 minutes after the dog has eaten it will need to void.   Do crate training as well for when the dog can not be supervised. This should insure that the dog won't have an accident while you're at work or wherever because most dogs will not go where they sleep.  You need to be consistent...it can take a couple of months. Welcome to the joys of puppyhood! I miss those days. :(<br>  <br>  Limit food and water intake after 6pm.   Feed twice per day at the same time every day.<br>  <br>  <br>  DO NOT EVER EVER EVER USE A PEE PAD OR LITTER BOX IN YOUR HOUSE! YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR PUPPY TO THINK THAT IT IS EVER OK TO WEE IN YOUR HOME!|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	Crate train! Put it in the crate when you are gone and at night.  Animals generally wont potty where they sleep.  When you take it out give praise for going potty.  When you are about to go  outside wait by the door and tell the dog "outside"  when you get out there say something like "do your business" or go potty"  when he/she goes then give lots of praise.  If it goes in the house put it in the crate.  That way it will know not to go in the house and if it ever gets in trouble it knows where to go!!!<br>  <br>  ADDED: If you get a crate make sure the puppy has enough room to stand fully and turn around.  And you should take it out more than every two hours especially after eating and sleeping.|`|0TghwMJqaa	it's a tough process. <br>  <br>  here are some things you could try:<br>  <br>  - take her out sooner<br>  - keep a VERY close eye on her and watch for signs that she may be going any second, pick her up and run her outside.<br>  - give her a firm 'NO' when she does it inside and take her out immediately<br>  - praise her like you've never praised before when she goes outside and does her deed 'very good baby' 'good girl' lots and lots of pets. <br>  - reward her with a treat at the beginning if you wish <br>  - play with her outside.. throw a ball around or something a bit.. that always made my boy have to go.<br>  <br>  hope some of these helped.<br>  <br>  dont ever spank her or rub her face in the mess she's made inside. never yell at her when she does go inside.. a firm 'no' is all you need, and you have to catch her in the act to say 'no' or 'ah' as a correction.<br>  <br>  if you find a mess inside.. you simply stay quiet, clean it up and take her outside for a bit.|`|HHD7Sc32aa	here is a great article on potty training, I think this may be able to really help you out - <a href="http://unleashedunlimited.com/housetraining-a-crate-training-idea/" rel="nofollow">http://unleashedunlimited.com/housetrain...</a>|`|YeGw45b4aa	everytime the puppy starts smelling around or first wakes up would be the best time to take her out|`|pTlKFfoGaa	I have a 10 month old female pitbull and i found out to newpaper train her was the best way for her to be house broken.

65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	A dog can have a complete ovariohysterectomy (spay) operation when she is pregnant, but it is VERY risky.  Most commonly this happens in an emergency situation, for example a stuck pup or uterine inertia during labor; the pups of course in this case are saved if possible and the mother dog is spayed during the c-section.<br>  Usually 'abortions' are performed accidentally, when a female dog is brought in for a spay and is discovered to be pregnant once the operation is underway.  Some owners do this purposely; again it is much more risky for the mother dog.  I honestly don't know of any vet who would purposely 'abort' pups unless the female's life was in danger.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	Yes.  They are not knowns as emergency spays.  They are known as aborts. Spays are removing the uterus and ovaries.  Aborts are removing the puppies.  Often times they go hand in hand, and are called an Emergency Spay/Abort.<br>  <br>  One of my dogs had an emergency spay, during her heat cycle.  She was never bred.  Had she been bred, it would have been an Emergency Spay/Abort.  We had to hurry up and do it because of the contract we signed.  We couldn't wait for a month or so after the heat, which is what many vets like to do.|`|qasOb5Jraa	Hi, bitches who are pregnant can still be spayed like a normal ***** which in effect is an abortion. This can be done quite far into the pregnancy but the longer it's left the more distressing and complicated it can be for the dog.|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	Yes and No- a veterinarian will abort puppies at the same time they are spaying a dog if the situation requires it.

Some dogs get their first heat aged six months and are not even fully grown by then. I guess other reasons could be that a dog is too old to cope with a pregnancy or if the dog has other health problems.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	You can also get a "morning after" injection for your dog.

QRBi7feQaa	your problem is simple to solve if its just wax or ear mites but if its something more sever u may need a vet for wax dont go to far into the ear but take damp cloth with mineral oil on and clean the cats ear if its ear mites use hartz ear mites treatment u can get it at most pet store or in grocery stores in the pet section|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi the cat could have ear mites if she is scratching and digging at her ears.  If the wax build up is kind of brown/black then this is the problem.  What you can do is go to any store that has cat and dog supplies and check and see if they have any ear mite medicine.  If not go to a ranch and farm supply store and look in the dog and cat section.  Also to clean the ears take a cotton balls and wet with warm water and Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo and clean till cotton ball comes clean.  You will need to do this before putting the med in the ears.  Keep in mind the ear mite medicine is not just a one day thing you have to do it for several days to kill them off.  I would try this as it sure sounds like ear mites.|`|Zw7IVfqeaa	The vet would have to do it. My cats let me in there with Q-Tips once and a while, but they're young yet. <br>  <br>  She also could have ear mites, which is really common in cats. Take her in.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Ears are very sensitive and easily damaged, so home remedies/over the counter products are not a good idea.  Best to take her to the vet for proper treatment.  At 12 she is certainly needing a senior exam.  Most vets are more than happy to work out payment arrangements.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|x7duxnBLaa	Since your cat is "digging at the base of her ear" and her ear is full of wax, I've had cats for years and this sounds like ear mites to me.  She's digging and scratching at her ear, because this makes a cat extremely uncomfortable until the mites are gone.  The wax you mentioned is probably the mites, as that's what it looks like, excessive ear wax, but it's really the microscopic mites that are present.  Take your kitty to the vet and have her examined.  You will be able to treat her at home and it does require treatment a couple of times a day and with persistence, can be eradicated.  I have treated several cats for this,successfully.  Good luck!
FhKfyxWlaa	You need to do some research. What's right for me, may not be right for you.  May I suggest that you take this time to enjoy whatever time remains with your beloved friend, and worry about your next companion when the family has had proper time to grieve and be ready for it.  I have an English Mastiff, and I would recommend the breed to anyone, but like I said, what is right for me may not be right for you.  English Mastiffs are not easy to train either. They can be very stubborn and need a lot of extra care. Dogs aren't born obedient...a good bond between dog and master will make that happen.You also need to take a lot of time to train.|`|Bw18seFqaa	from my personal experience.. Standard poodles are good dogs, if you dont mind the grooming.  They are easy to train, and very eager to please.

They're not big but they're bulky. They're also one of only two breeds (not sure what the other is, possibly a labrador) that the KC says are particularly good with children which explains why they're often affectionately nicknamed "Nanny dogs". They're also very intelligent which means they ought to be easy to train. I would say smaller dogs are the worst ones for barking so I wouldn't worry too much about that. I have a staff and let me assure you that they're such noble, playful, intelligent dogs. :)<br>  <br>  Other suggestions are Labrador, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and Saint Bernard.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I wouldn't get a new dog while your dog is unwell.

0mb78CiWaa	It should be. The only problem you may have, is it may try rounding up your children. Collies are known to do it. The dog will be very energetic too. Both Labradors and Collies are very intelligent dog breeds. So it should be very smart too. I would take it to training classes right away, before it learns any bad habits.<br>  <br>  Here is some information on Border collies.This high-drive breed is extremely energetic and requires exercise beyond just a walk around the block or a romp in the yard. They thrive when they have a job to do and space to run. Due to their tendency to herd objects and people, they do best with mature, well-behaved children. They love their families, but may be somewhat reserved with strangers. They are seasonal shedders, and require regular brushing.<br>  <br>  And some information on Labradors.An ideal sporting and family dog, the Labrador Retriever thrives as part of an active family or as a trusted hunting companion. A double-coated breed which sheds seasonally, regular grooming keeps his coat at its water-resistant best. Because of his even temperament and train-ability millions of Americans own a Labrador Retriever as a pet.|`|AA12128656	only if the dog and children are both well trained. <br>  <br>  that's a must.<br>  <br>  it may be too active for the little one though...|`|bIaywrBCaa	depends more on the dog than the breed or breeds.

Border Collies especially can be high strung when they are not stimulated. They also have the tendency to herd. They were bred to herd sheep, not to be family dogs. So normally they will herd anything that moves. Your 2 year old must never be left alone unsupervised with the dog. The children must also be taught how to handle and treat the dog. They can become the best of friends if they are taught to play with the dog without hurting it.

R9VNS1vcaa	If you already have a light and the fish is always hiding try taking the light off to see if it come out more. Also betta fish are nocturnal, so the light may disrupt its sleep pattens. In regard to the fact the betta fish containers say you should have a light I have a betta fish and do not have a light and i have had the same fish for over a year now, therefore I think they are unnecessary. I keep my tank at a room tempertature, but if you place the tank in a cold environment you may need a light to keep it warm. If you want my opinion i think they tell you to get a light so you spend more money on their products.

As I have posted before - a rabbit is a self cleaning animal. Plus, they retain and loose heat through their ears. A bath can cause hypothermia in rabbits and can cause shock.<br>  <br>  There are vaccinations available for rabbits. You should definately take your new rabbit to see a vet once you get him/her. There are several diseases that can affect a rabbit and even cause death.<br>  <br>  Get your mom to purchase pet bedding that is not cedar/pine based. Wood type bedding is BAD for rabbits. You will need to purchase a bag of Timothy hay to feed your rabbit, as well as a good quality pellet. Keep treats to a minimal and DO NOT feed your rabbit lettuce or cabbage because it can cause diarrhea in your rabbit and diarrhea can be fatal in rabbits.<br>  <br>  A good cage or hutch will be needed to house your rabbit. You will need a food dish, water bottle, bedding and some toys for your rabbit. You will need to keep his/her cage clean and give your rabbit fresh food and water daily. <br>  <br>  You must always, and I mean always, handle your rabbit properly. This can reduce the chances of your rabbit being injured by falling.

(Understandable?) A famous poet says this, ? do not remember his name.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	You sound like you are a kid?  Whether or not a rabbit is a good idea depends largely on you and your parents. Do keep in mind that with proper care a rabbit will live 8-10 years. What will happen when you go off to college? Dorms generally do not allow them, and it is quite difficult to find a rental that will accept them, especially with a first-time renter. Make sure your parents are on board and that they are prepared to meet your rabbit's physical and emotional needs when you are no longer there. Make sure you know what you are getting into. Rabbits are NOT generally the cuddly critters people make them out to be. Most hate to be held, they prefer to remain on the floor, and many will not even enjoy being pet. They are prey animals, so it takes a lot to win their trust and they are quite skittish. They need quiet, gentle owners who are patient and willing to work to gain their trust. Your household should be quiet and you need to keep to a strict routine with their care. They are not easy to care for properly. They need careful attention paid to their diet. <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet....</a> You will need to change their litter box daily or every other day at the least, or they smell.  I recommend adopting from a rescue or shelter- often they use foster homes and will be able to give you a good idea of their personalities. Plus, usually shelter and rescue rabbits come already spayed or neutered, which can get quite expensive and is really necessary when dealing with a pet for both behavioral and health reasons.  You do not 'walk' rabbits, but they do need 4-6 hours daily of supervised exercise time out of their cage.  Feeding quantities will vary by size of rabbit, one of the sites I posted has detailed guidance as far as diet is concerned.  <br>  <br>  This site has the best care information out there: <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/</a> Start with the 'first time visitor' links near the top. <br>  <br>  Also check out this site: <a href="http://wondertime.go.com/life-at-home/article/first-pets-rabbit_SP.html" rel="nofollow">http://wondertime.go.com/life-at-home/ar...</a> It is geared toward homes with young children, but it will provide a good overview of what life with a rabbit is REALLY like. <br>  <br>  As far as what kind: As a general rule, the larger the rabbit, the calmer and friendlier because they are less worried about becoming 'lunch'. <br>  <br>  By far the NASTIEST breeds which I would avoid are the Netherland Dwarf and the Polish (who are also the smallest breeds). They bite first and ask questions later. Due to their small size, they will find you utterly terrifying and will often not hesitate to bite you to defend themselves. I had a Netherland I was fostering bite completely through my finger once while I was restraining him for the vet. I have had far more bites inflicted by this breed than any other. They are NOT generally suitable for a first-time bunny owner and do not make good pets in many cases (though, as with other things, there are individual exceptions to every rule).<br>  <br>  Larger rabbits tend to be a lot calmer, more likely to interact with you, and less likely to spend all their time trying to hide from you. I recommend a breed in the 10 pound + range as a first rabbit, especially if there are children in the home (who, btw should not be permitted to pick up a rabbit, ever, as the rabbit can break their own spine struggling if held improperly). I have a pair of really wonderful Californians presently, and other breeds I've had come through rescue who tend to be gentler include the English and French Lop, Flemish Giant, New Zealand, Chinchilla (Giant or American), Harlequin, and Satin. <br>  <br>  If you feel that you must have a small breed, the two that I would recommend you take a look at are the Mini Lop and the Holland Lop, both of which tend to be calmer than their other small counterparts.|`|HULRxii5aa	Preferably buy rabbit nuggets as apposed to rabbit muesli as they only pick out the bits they like in muesli and lose valuable nutrients, whereas in nuggets everything is in one. the details of how much food to give the rabbit is usually on the back of the pack as it varies by breed.<br>  <br>  Never feed it lettuce or tomatoes as this upsets the rabbits stomach. Apple (no pips), tiny bits of banana, seedless grapes, carrots, broccoli, sprouts, spinach, grass, hay, water.<br>  <br>  You can buy rabbits from breeders or in most pet shops. As this is your first rabbit, I wouldn't go for a large rabbit breed (Dwarf lops can grow to be huge despite the breed.) I would recommend a nether land dwarf rabbit as they are very small and docile. <br>  <br>  If you are using a litter tray in the cage/hutch then that should be emptied daily, the rest of the cage once/twice a week. <br>  <br>  When you first get your rabbit, just hold your fingers in front of it's nose so as it can get your scent. Do not hold it for the first day or two, so as it can get used to it's surroundings. Hold the rabbits with one hand under it's rear to support it, and one on it's back. sit with it and <br>  stroke it. Keep things quiet while you hold it as they are timid creatures. Hold it at least once a day, as regular handling prevents from aggressive behaiour.<br>  <br>  It is not compulsory to walk your rabbit, although some people do for exercise and bonding purposes. <br>  <br>  You should also buy your rabbit something wooden to keep it's teeth trimmed, and many toys for stimulation (Can purchase form most pet shops.) In warmer weather let your rabbit on the lawn in a run of some sort.<br>  <br>  Hope this was enough to help you. Good luck if you get your little rabbit - you'll never look back.

You can train them to come when called pretty quickly (I think the longest it has ever taken for me is a couple of weeks, and I was more of the slacker during that time than the rats).  Find a treat they absolutely love (I use yogurt drops - but anything they like will work), and reserve it specifically for the reward of when they come when called (don't give it to them any other time).  Doing this, I've never had a problem getting them to come back (but I still always give them the yogurt drop when playtime is over).<br>  <br>  If you are still worried (or for while you are training them to come when called) - try one of these:<br>  <br>  1.  Tape large cardboard boxes together to form a big play area (big enough to where you can be in there, too!)  The rats can't climb the cardboard.<br>  <br>  2. If you're bed is not low to the ground (at least 22 inches off the floor), you can use your bed as the initial play area - very few rats will jump down that far in a short amount of time (if you leave them unsupervised for hours, they might jump off - but if you are there and playing with them, it is highly unlikely one will jump down).  If your bed is close to the ground, though (under 18") they will likely jump down and you can't use this method.<br>  <br>  3. Rat-proof a bathroom and use it as the play area.<br>  <br>  As for playtime, rats love to climb and explore.  I've used thick, braided-fleece ropes for them to climb and made "bridges" and "steps" of various things for them get back into the cage.  I scatter some food around the play area for them to forage and find and then take back to the cage to cache.  My rats also like to chase my hand and cat toys.  I've never actually taught my rats to fetch, but I know of lots of people who have.  Some people even have their rats dive for peas in small water dishes.  Pretty much, though, rats will love anything that involves some running around and YOU!<br>  <br>  *** Addition ***<br>  I'm sure LooLoo means well - but you can't put rats in hamster balls (even if they are bigger and sold as "for rats" or ferrets).  Rats are smarter than hamsters, and where hamsters just run around the ball - the rats will know they are trapped inside and will freak out. <br>  <br>  The tables are a good idea, too!  I've let my rats run on the counters - but not the table, yet.  I'll have to try it.|`|3BVDSwgNaa	Do you have an old folding table that you could cover with a fleece blanket?  Put some toys on there like and empty box with some newsprint or paper towels stuffed inside, just about any little kid's toy, a bowl of towels to hide it.... they are naturally curious and will have fun exploring everything.  <br>  My cages both sit on tables and they all get  plenty of excercise everyday.   They know the edge of the table means DOWN and don't fall off. <br>  <br>  I've tried the whole shutting them in the bathroom but the floor is just too cold -- they love their freedom on the tables :)|`|4vrUbRujaa	if ur rats aren't really big, u can try hamster ball...<br>  it looks something like this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uberreview.com/wp-content/uploads/run-about-ball-hamster.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.uberreview.com/wp-content/upl...</a><br>  <br>  or u can use a rat leash and it's like this (it's not cruel to put a leash on a rat, cuz it doesn't hure at all)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fancypetrats.com/pet-rats-images/pet-rat-on-leash-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fancypetrats.com/pet-rats-ima...</a><br>  <br>  i u can purchase it in any pet's shop.<br>  <br>  i let my hamsters free run in a room, just close the door ( make sure the room doen't has any hole, or wire and that it can't escapt under the door).

They are not a dog that you can buy and leave crated for eight hours while you are at work - they need constant attention and things to do to be happy or they become extremely destructive.  They are literally known as a 2 year old in a dog suit if that tells you anything.  <br>  <br>  With that said they are wonderful dogs whose number one goal is to entertain and love their owner.  Below is a link to Madcap Bull Terriers website which has a really funny, but informative set articles on the true clownish mischievous nature of the bull terrier.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|pNKCKccZaa	Bull Terrier are smart dogs|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	My husband and I have a gorgeous girl. These are dogs that need lots of attention and lots of love, they need a firm hand while training but don't hit them or be overly aggressive. We are raising our girl around other animals we have 3 cats and a rabbit she is excellent with them. We make sure she spends time with other dogs so she isn't aggressive. We have had to teach her to be gentle, she doesn't know her own strength and she can easily hurt someone without meaning to.These dogs are loyal loving and absolute sweethearts that being said it is based on the owner, this breed has a reputation for a reason they are powerful and can be very dangerous they can be raised to be a loaded gun all the owner has to do is point it at what they want it to kill.

When a fish gets ill they have trouble swimming and they sink to the bottom of the tank and they lay on their side, when this happen its because the fish is dying. Just enjoy your fish and observe any changes in his activities, if he seems different in anyway you can take him to where you bought him and they can tell you if he's coming down with anything.|`|6f1MNa01aa	I'm sure they can see it but not understand it|`|AA10245555	You're male betta is threatened by the flashy T.V. he is stressed and will die if not moved to a more quiet spot.<br>  A fish can see a television and all the movement and colour.

s76aC4G8aa	Digging is a habit that can be broken by putting his own feces ontop of the holes he's dug.  Provide him with his own digging place like a sandbox and hide his toys in the sand and show him what is appropriate for him to dig and if he digs your yard remove him to the sandbox and praise him when he digs in the box he'll soon learn.<br>  <br>  Also as for the barking, if you've given attention when he's barking he'll learn it's how he gets things so you must ignore him when he does this and only give attention and praise when he stops.  If he barks in the crate do not let him out until he's quiet.  He will soon learn barking gets him no where.<br>  <br>  Takes time and consistency of training but it will stop if you don't reinforce the barking and only reinforce the quiet.|`|Ef4rGLGvaa	Research dog training.

Google will help you more than this website.|`|6t5kQnSFaa	The digging and excessive barking points right at a lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Do you take him on walks or just let him run around in the backyard? Walking is more than just physical exercise if you teach him properly and it can go a long ways toward tiring him out.<br>  <br>  What type of breed?<br>  <br>  As little as a 30 min walk before you leave the house in the morning and one before you go to bed could help the problem (all the depends on the energy level of the pup.)<br>  <br>  iloverboxerdogs: it will only confuse the dog if you try to correct them after the fact. <br>  <br>  If you are out there with them when they start digging, then by all means give them a quick command to stop, but if you see what they've done after a few minutes then the dog is going to have no idea what you're telling them.|`|AN9nhN5oaa	maybe get a trainor <br>  it costs money<br>  but it usually helps^.^|`|S8Tzx44paa	What breed is the puppy? Some dog breeds are known to bark a lot. You can stop him from digging by putting a balloon in each of the dug holes.

Give him safe, good chew toys when he is in his crate.  Give him a treat to run into his crate.  Don't leave him there over long except at night.  Play with the pup and walk him everyday so he learns to be good on a leash and he is socialized.  The pup needs to be trained.  He is still like a little kid. He hasn't even gotten to the obnoxious teen age yet.  Look into puppy training classes or some good information on training using positive reinforcement.   Digging and barking are from boredom, in general, and too much energy/too little exercise.|`|NGlR5Wq5aa	Unfortunately, he is at a very barky age. But he would probably benefit from some simple training classes ($100 at Petsmart), as for the digging, we would sprinkle a little red pepper on the ground and our dog stopped, but each dog is different.
qHwI9ev8aa	Mine did. We left him in a kennel for two days and he barked the whole time. When we came to get him, his mouth was opening but only a little squeak came out!|`|mfXDUkRYaa	If your dog has been barking that much, I would be worrying that he is bored or stressed, and would try to find out what's causing it so I could fix the problem.|`|BiiRWTZ9aa	How old is your dog? What breed is it?<br>  If a dog sounds hoarse when it is barking it could possibly be laryngeal paralysis. A voice change is usually the first sign.<br>  <br>  Other signs of laryngeal paralysis include:<br>  The dog might be making a lot of noise when breathing in and they may choke while eating. The symptoms get worse when the dog is exercising.<br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest you take your dog to your vet.<br>  Good luck!:)|`|IQVfbmR7aa	Dogs can lose their "voice" from excessive barking. You can't do anything, it'll just come back eventually. I wouldn't want it to come back if I were you, I mean, if your dog is barking all the time. It must be nice to have peace and quiet :D|`|JVHCFXXVaa	Probably not from too much barking. But he may have another problem like pneumonia. You should take him to the vet.|`|6qngoElyaa	dogs cant talk, silly
S8Tzx44paa	You should probably get the assistance of a professional trainer and also get a shock collar.|`|AA12128656	DO NOT put a shock collar on your dog. that will make it WORSE. he will think the pain is  from the other dog!<br>  <br>  a muzzle could be a good idea, but what you REALLY need to do is join a training class with the dog. socialize him better, and train him better. <br>  i have a pit bull terrier who truly dislikes other dogs. however, she won't bite or even posture to them, because i have her trained to do other behaviors. <br>  you may have to train your dog alternative behavior, too. and until you have him properly trained and socialized, do not take him to the dog park, it may just cause him undue stress. there are many dogs that don't need dog parks, mine included. a romp with their owner in the woods is just as good, and a game of fetch in the yard is very satisfying. playing with other dogs does NOTHING to reinforce your dog's training or the bond you have with it at this point.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You need to get an appointment with a behaviorist ASAP.<br>  This is your fault, you knew of his aggression and you still took him.

Do not take him to the dog park.    Yes you can muzzle him but do not take him to the dog bark.  You need to be sure you get the correct type of muzzle.

He feels uncomfortable, so he turns to bite him. You shock him, and it hurts. He probably won't associate the shock with the aggression himself; it's easier for him to think, "Oh, every time I go near that puppy, I get shocked!" He'll try to avoid the puppy, but the puppy follows him. He doesn't want it near him - it's making him get hurt! So he lashes out even more aggressively to make the puppy go away.<br>  <br>  You shock him a few more times, and he starts to associate the shock with all puppies, making him dislike them even stronger. He will eventually either stay away from most dogs, attacking them if they come close, or redirect the aggression, which you don't want.<br>  <br>  He may not even associate the shock with the puppy - maybe he'll associate it with the certain patch of ground, or the dog park itself.<br>  <br>  There's so many things that could go wrong if you attempt to train him this way - seek out a trainer or class in your area. No dog park until he gets "ok-ed" by the trainer or behaviorist.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Why are people always so keen on getting shock collars? You should be working on making him see other dogs as a good thing not a bad thing (shocking him will make him associate the pain with the other dog, thus increasing his aggression towards other dogs).<br>  <br>  You need to keep him on lead when there are other dogs about, and muzzled. Doing these two simple things will mean there is no need to even think about any form of aggressive "training". I bet pushing him on his side didn't help as it would have made him feel insecure. Cesar Millan has a lot to answer for.<br>  <br>  If you want to see an improvement in his behaviour then you will need to consult a qualified behaviourist.<br>  <br>  It sounds like he wasn't adequately socialised but that doesn't mean he is a lost cause, but as he has done significant damage I wouldn't be taking any chances if I were you.<br>  <br>  No one can give you any more advice over the Internet than to keep out of dangerous situations and consult a behaviourist.

The boxed puppy could have "looked" at your dog the wrong way and it set him off.<br>  There could be a certain threat vibe your dog gets off of Boxers in general. Making him act the way he did.<br>  <br>  My husky has been attacked 2 times at the dog park. Nothing serious.. but when i told my obedience trainers this had happened they said that huskies are very strong willed dogs, and a lot of dogs are intimidated by them and that is also another reason why others act out. <br>  Same with Boxers.<br>  <br>  My obedience trainers hate the dog parks.. they say "you may know your dog, but you don't know others". It's very true. I had a grey hound attack my husky, when he was 5 months old. The owner assured me he was a great dog and it wouldn't happen again. When we were leaving the park.. the owner let the greyhound go and it attacked my boy again.<br>  <br>  like i said, seek professional help and stop going to the dog park, your dog is dog aggressive and it'll happen again, next time maybe worse. It's not worth the risk.<br>  If you must take him.. take him at a time when he'll be the only one in there. (late at night, very early in the morning.. if another dog shows up.. immediately leash yours and leave)<br>  <br>  Sorry this has happened, i would feel terrible as well. <br>  Shock collars are definitely not okay.<br>  <br>  I've also heard that when you 'pin' your dog down.. it's actually worse for them even though you think you're doing good. It actually makes them more aggressive. I bet if another dog 'pinned' him down.. he would lose it.|`|HyqS3KFraa	I own a dog-aggressive dog myself, and for what it is worth, I do NOT and will NOT use a shock collar on her.  I do however use one on my hunting breed dog, for hunting purposes.  The reason I won't use it on my aggressive dog is this...<br>  Dog sees Dog, get's mean look in his eye (so is already mad) and feels a zap in the neck...  How will dog react?  <br>  Most likely, more mad, so more aggressive.<br>  <br>  I think that if i put a shock collar on my dog, and she charged another dog, it would probably work the first...maybe TWO times and then I think she will start to relate Stranger Dog to OW MY NECK and get more upset and possibly (and knowing her, MOST LIKELY) more aggressive.  HOWEVER, my dog is almost 4.  Your dog is still a pup, and it may be worth a shot, however, I won't do it for my dog. <br>  Instead, unfortunately I don't take her to dog parks.  She can't even be in my fenced in yard alone, because she has attacked the fence and injured the neighbors dog on the other side!  So shes leash walked every time shes outside, no exceptions.  <br>  Is she missing out on socialization...yes.  But I'd rather her be happy and content while at home, than risk the consequence of having to put her down because i took my aggressive dog out around other dogs.  <br>  I am sure your dog is not anywhere near the stages my dog is in with her aggression.  You have tons of time to train him.<br>  Do you tense up when you see your dog tense up?  Dogs sense that, and react in a way they feel necessary.  Go in to the dog park with the mindset that you have the best behaved dog, the friendliest dog... and see if he acts any differently.  <br>  I have tried numerous behaviorists as well, to no luck... so while your dog is still young, do all you can! and GOOD LUCK!!!|`|KLMWlQ9Raa	Puppies are like small children, they are still finding themselves and act very unsure w/jerky body motions.  You can take the analogy from there.  He may have picked up something from the puppy we humans may not see.  That he's so well trained you get compliments says something positive.  None the less, a quarantine is in the rottie's future as a result & you already know this.  As to the other things, try a Halti or other form of gentle leader collar.  Shock collar, maybe; consult a behavioral specialist.  Your vet may know of one.  Regardless, the dog park may be something to wait on until you know that he can be controlled for your sake & his.|`|Wt61EclRaa	I would suggest a muzzle.  I personally have no problem with them.  If it will save another dog or person from being bitten then that is a good thing.  We have a greyhound who for his whole life before we got him wore one.  They are not tight fitting like the nylon ones.  They can eat and drink with them on.  We used it when introducing him to our cat.  Better to be safe.  When we board him they all wear them so they don't bite or nip on another when they are in the yard.  <br>  If your dog enjoys the dog park and he is trained in all other ways then just find a decent muzzle that is comfortable.  It will also make other dog owners feel at ease as a Rotti can sometimes seem intimidating to some people.    Prevention is the best.  a Shock collar is no guarantee.  A muzzle they can't bite no matter what.  They can still pounce on a small dog and paw them but usually at dog parks you separate the small dogs from the large ones.  Good luck.  Here is a picture of the muzzle we have.  I have fabric tape on it so it's not uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ngap.org/greyhound-dog-muzzle-i35920.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ngap.org/greyhound-dog-muzzle...</a>|`|hBiSNoE7aa	DO NOT get a shock collar, that might not even stop the behavior, and it will make your dog feel frustrated and will not help the situation. You need a behaviorist to help you understand why your dog is doing this. It's also possible that your dog is just not the kind of dog that can be taken to a dog park, and you might have to accept that. For now, I would say a muzzle would help prevent the situation but it is not foolproof as dogs can slip them off. Do not use a nylon muzzle that closes the mouth. Use a basket style one (like they put on racing greyhounds) so that he can still pant and drink water and so that it is more comfortable and not causing greater frustration and anxiety to the dog. But you need the help of a behaviorist otherwise your dog is a ticking time bomb and the shock collar or muzzle are only band-aids on a bigger problem.

I also agree that a donut will help in the future.  However, this condition involves the bursal sac and can become a chronic problem.

But before I do this I would first give the pony a penicillin shot to see if that doesn't heal up his abscess.  To get a better look at it have someone hold his head so that he can't turn towards you, if the abscess is oozing than thats a good thing, get some betadine and warm water and clean it out, hes going to need some antibiotic to get rid of the infection, so like I said give him a penicillin shot and keep the wound clean.  After you clean the wound put terracycline on the wound this will help the wound to heal faster.  Clean it out every day if you can do it morning and night your pony will soon feel a whole lot better.  Good Luck|`|a0309e3a32a74064ccda5c6a7c7178a0aa	I agree that it sounds like a shoe boil.  I would get a shoe donut and rinse it with cold water for about ten minutes each day and apply triple antibiotic/nolvasan, or some anti-bacterial cream that will repel bugs and soothe the area.  If your pony has a fever, it starts to look worse instead of better, or doesn't seem to be improving after ten days or so - call the vet.|`|iaHxaUBlaa	bag balm.|`|503d9ec02105447e5fb64bf3f4d54952aa	sounds like he popped a capped elbow, aka shoe boil. if it popped keep it clean and maybe get your horse a shoe donut so he isnt temped to bump it again (or course do this after the area is clean and healed,) if it is a huge bump hard like then it will go down on it's own if it's NOT popped open and soft you can have a vet come out to lance it, but it is unneeded. it is just a blemish that will go down within a few months... and even if it hasnt popped you can use the shoe donut around the horses leg so that he doesnt bump it again.<br>  <br>  you can clean it with just water, if you're unsure usually a vet can tell you over the phone what your next step should be and if you should wrap or not.

Yours should not take that long as I feel my rescue was not properly taken care of or handled.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	It sounds like he is comfortable in his tank. Take your time with him. He lets you hold him, let him get to trust you. He will come around.<br>  Good luck!|`|2qgg2G8kaa	He probably feels more comfortable in his enclosure. You should take him out everyday so he gets used to being away from his enclosure. That's the best I could tell you. I have a king snake named Steve and he always tries going back in his enclosure. He really enjoys is because it's a pretty large enclosure and gives him space to run around.|`|YemB9gSiaa	The others are correct.  He needs time and opportunities to become accustomed to being out.  Mine go all over town with me on my shoulders.  <br>  Go to www.yahoogroups.com <br>  Join these dragon groups specifically: <br>  (They are active and informative) <br>   I hope to see you there.<br>  <br>  pogona@yahoogroups.com<br>  <br>  pogona_diseases@yahoogroups.com<br>  <br>  www.beardeddragons.org <br>  and <br>  wwwbeautifuldragons.com <br>  <br>  These are two very good info sites as well.|`|DHCXeLvvaa	It sounds like he is really comfortable in his tank, so every day take him out for 5-10 minutes until he gets used to it.
