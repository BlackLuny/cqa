GtdOYLOeaa	Il nuoto come in tutti gli sport, necessita di carboidrati, e si ottengono attraverso della buona pasta, questo tipo di piatto come saprai,  eccezionale per noi italiani se servito con del sugo al rag o gi di li, questo per ne comporta una lenta digestione, quindi ti consiglio pasta in bianco digeribile velocemente e in modo tranquillo, oppure con del pomodoretto fresco, per secondo carne bianca ai ferri sarebbe l'deale, poi basta della semplice frutta, come mele o pere, e direi che sei a posto hai immagazzinato tutt quanto serve per fare sport, al termine della attivit sportiva, anzich bere dell'acqua (cosa che spessissimo avviene da parte di un p tutti ed  sbagliatissimo) ti consiglio dopo una mezzora, un buon yogurt anche alla frutta, ti disinfetta gli intestini, visto che l'acqua della piscina non  il massimo, e ti predispone per la cena, che non dovrebbe essere prima di almeno ad un'ora  di distanza, francamente l'ideale  due ore ma bisogna vedere a che ora termini i tuoi allenamenti, spero di esserti stato utile.  P.S.  ovvio che il suggerimento  che ci avvenga come hai dichiarato  6 ore prima dell'attivit sportiva, prima di entrare in acqua non devi aver mangiato nulla da almeno 2 ore se hai una digestione normale, altrimenti anche solo dei biscotti se hai una digestione lenta devono passare almeno 3 ore.|`|T883OKxoaa	con 6 ore di tempo puoi anche andare dai cinesi a mangiarti cani fritti[che per te li spacciano come pollo]|`|2d5c60bb8d0c0fe241ecf505ceb463cfaa	prima dell'esercizio fisico non si mangia  rischioso.e non si mangia prima di entrare in acqua.devono passare almeno 2 ore e se il pasto era molto calorico o abbondante ne devono passare pure 3 di ore|`|043ba16c7652b05e0e996194cfcda148aa	sarebbe meglio niente  ma quanto dura? se dura poco nn puoi aspettare e mangiare qualcosina dp?|`|fc5edc740e99b6665df225443123c2cbaa	cioccolato ,energia immediata!assolutam no panini e simili!|`|hSvujTkbaa	quello ke tgi mpare|`|CRTgaRK5aa	anch'io nuoto....consigliano la pasta!!! perch a differenza di quanto si pensa,  digeribile subito ( chiaro, non bisogna mangiarla troppo condita) e d molta energia!!  magari con del pomodoro fresco...|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	bh...se mangi sei ore prima...puoi mangiarti quello che vuoi...ma ti consiglio personalmente di mangiarti qualcosa(un panino,un pezzo di cioccolato...)anke un'oretta prima...|`|RcHjVXNeaa	fossi in te non mangerei niente...al massimo mangia un'insalata...non so come digerisca il tuo organismo...meglio andare sul sicuro

A parte che sono scettica su queste cose "fai da te" tipo macchinari come questi, lampade ecc. ecc. Gli effetti ci sono se abbini anche attivit fisica "attiva" (non fatta con la vibrapower) e, naturalmente, una dieta adeguata. Presenta per molte controindicazioni anche gravi quali: distaccamento della retina, danni alla colonna vertebrale, crisi epilettiche...inoltre molti degli esercizi segnati sono dannosi e scorretti; andrebbe usata con la supervisione di un professionista del fitness.  Ti dico questo perch nella palestra in cui vado ho fatto la prova grautita con il personal trainer, e lui stesso mi ha sconsigliato di non utilizzarla; mi ha spiegato che su 50 esercizi rappresentati solo pochissimi erano effettivamente validi. Tieni presente che le sedute per l'utilizzo della macchina costano 30 euro,e se addirittura il personal me la sconsiglia....
f2KnScUdaa	Sono entrambi molto consigliabili, ma l'acquagym consente principalmente di dimagrire (si possono ottenere anche risultati rapidi frequentando regolarmente), il nuoto di definire la muscolatura e allargare le spalle, ecco perch spesso la prima viene preferita dalle donne e la seconda dagli uomini.  Comunque, molti pensano all'acquagym quasi come ad un'attivit di tutto riposo, ma io che la faccio posso assicurarti che non lo ,  tanto massacrante quanto divertente, soprattutto se la pratichi con qualcuno che conosci. :)|`|JUZEvLXcaa	Sono tutti e due ottimi sport poich la piscina  utilissima se vuoi rinforzare muscoli o dimagrire...    Un esempio: una mia amica ha fatto acqua gym x dimagrire, ha perso i chili e in pi ha rinforzato le gambe, rendendo tutto pi sodo...    Dipende sempre cosa preferisci, acquagym a me piace molto di pi:  divertente, c' la musica e fai un sacco di esercizi...|`|3BdrSV10aa	io sono un nuotatore dell'agonismo e per me consumi + calorie con l'acqua gym!|`|M0pGXY3Taa	acquagym non  niente in confronto a due (e dico due) vasche a farfalla... @_@ nuoto per sempre!|`|qmWWQNFgaa	io faccio nuoto libero, saltellare con l'acquagym e quell'odiosa musica non lo reggo...  cmq dipende da che duro allenatore di te stesso sei...|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	il nuoto magari  pi completo a livello muscolare, l'acquagym  come l'aerobica ma in acqua, e con tanti esercizi brevi ma diversi (e intensi) sviluppa la corporatura in pi punti; inoltre essendo un lavoro aerobico brucia pi calorie; se poi unisci la naturale azione levigante dell'acqua otterrai tonificazione e miglioramento della circolazione, con sensibile diminuimento di cellulite e adipe. Secondo me scarica un sacco lo stress e la musica pu piacere o non piacere, in genere  molto ritmata, usano quella per fare aerobica o step e secondo me non  affatto male e si presta molto agli esercizi. Ma questo varia da persona a persona...|`|chJwAR5Vaa	.. il pi bello  il nuoto libero!!!

Nel tuo caso mancano alcuni dati, che per sono facilmente deducibili, quali andatura e tempo di riposo.

Ws7WYteyaa	carissimo grazie dei saluti. Come ti ho gi detto non sono una ex agonista di recente generazione ma nuoto da sempre  e ho imparato da piccola( piscina seria, con corsi selettivi al punto che tra le mie compagne  molte sono diventate atlete di livello), ma all'epoca nulla mi interesava meno del nuoto agonistico, mi piaceva molto di pi lo sci. La mia prima e anche ultima gara l'ho fatta da adulta nel centro dove portavo a nuotare i miei figli piccoli, e dove nuotavo regolarmente 2 volte la settimana per tutto l'anno. Per non so quale iniziativa promozionale avevano organizzato una manifestazione adulti, bambini, insomma tutti i frequentatori ciascuno nella sua categoria. Hanno insistito, non ho potuto rifiutare( me l'ha chiesto l'istruttore dei miei figli !!) mi vergognavo come una ladra anche perch c'erano a guardare tutti i genitori dei compagni dei miei bambini.E come si dice fortuna audaces.....mi  uscito il miglior 25 metri della mia vita( devo dire che ho gudagnato con il tuffo che tra i simpatizzanti  non agonisti  poco praticato e spesso addirittura controproducente!!) ho messo le gambe a "balla" quasi non ho respirato e.....quando ho tirato su la testa per guardarmi intorno ho scoperto di aver vinto!!!( ovviamente nella categoria in cui mi avevano messa che non comprendeva certo campioni olimpici) Dato che erano abituati a gare di bambini c'era anche il podio con consegna della medaglia!!!! .In fondo per mi ero divertita ma ho provato anche un po' di imbarazzo.......la storia  finita li. Mi piace troppo questo sport soprattutto se praticato a buoni livelli e da gente giovane ed efficiente e.....ma questa  un'altra storia......ciao|`|Xy6fATOFaa	ciao,la mia prima gara e stata un mese fa a Venosa panico totale non so perche ,non sapevo nulla mi hanno voluto iscri  vere di forza. la notte precedente non ho dormito,l'attesa e' stata micidiale ,salito sul blocco cuore a mille parto in ritardo gara 4 sec, in piu' rispetto agli allenamenti.  sabato scorso ho gareggiato a rieti ,bronzo nei 50 rana.TUTTO UN'ALTRA COSA CIAOOOOOO..|`|AD6b96yLaa	io finora l'ho fatta solo 1 e devo dire ke  stata molto emozionante|`|bsOHUmExaa	Ricambio i saluti al grande Gabrio che oltre ad essere valido a rispondere alle domande  anche capace di porne di interessanti.    La mia carriera da nuotatore agonista  cominciata molto molto tardi, avevo infatti 13 anni.  La mia prima gara  stata nel circuito C.S.I, ed era una gara del piffero e male organizzata.  Avevo iniziato a fare allenamenti da circa tre settimane. Ero abituato ad essere il pi forte del corso di nuoto e a vincere tutte le garettine sui 25 dei saggi di natale. E' facile immaginare la pacca nei denti che ho preso quando ho scoperto che in realt ero (sono) lento come una lumaca e che la mia tecnica era pessima (quella almeno ora  molto migliorata :-)).  Veniamo al punto comunque. La distanza erano i 50 stile ed ho fatto un clamoroso 38!! Pure io ho sbagliato la virata perch ero cos impegnato a pensare "vai forte! vai forte!" che me ne sono dimenticato O_o    Ciao a tutti gli answeriani amanti del nuoto! Continuaimo cos!!|`|rUDswBFTaa	la mia prima gara fu una manifestazione giovanile nella piscina Scandone a napoli,avevo 9-10 anni,feci i 50 stile ke nn andarono malissimo,mi piazzai al 3-4 posto e fu un esperienza emozionante,il problema  ke poi x pian piano il nuoto mi annoiava e cosi ho cominciato a dedicarmi alla pallanuoto ke,essendo uno sporti di squadra  pi divertente,ma cmq il nuoto  uno sport bellissimo|`|4f5A3Jgaaa	La mia prima gara  stata quando avevo 5 anni il trofeo era il pesciolino selvaggio a savona e la piscina era all' aperto con vasca da 50 metri arrivai terzo della mia batteria a dorso e mi diedero un materassino gonfiabile come pi giovane partecipante alla manifestazione.... quindi  andata benissimo!!anche se ci squalificarono la staffetta....|`|I1G5vi92aa	avevo 7 anni e tremavo tutta....  appena mi ha chiamato la mia istruttrice dicendomi che toccava il mio turno io ero in panico. Lei mi ha detto: "e che ci fa se arrivi ultima.....tanto lo so che arrivi prima....ma comunque...in ogni caso sappi che sei tu per me la migliore"  mi ha dato un coraggio assurdo...  e infatti poi alla fine sono arrivata prima....  senza di lei non ce l'avrei mai fatta!|`|kd2Zlpp9aa	beh la mia prima gara devo dire k  stato il massimo...avevo una super tensione all'inizio e facevo i propaganda...anke io nei 50 metri dorso e sono arrivato primo  avevo 8-9 anni|`|VarBohSeaa	non l'ho mai fatta...non  che mi bocciano??|`|BNczjtYqaa	Ciao, la mia prima gara  stata nel 2002 se non ricordo male, avevo 12/13 anni...  era il secondo anno che ho iniziato l'agoinismo con il nuoto puro e salvamento...

Anche io ho fatto i 50 dorso, e non  andata male. Partivo nell'ultima batteria e se pur con un tempaccio sono riuscito a stravincere la mia batteria arrivando quarto (44"3, gara propaganda). Ovviamente pensavo di aver vinto la gara, e ci sono rimasto un po' male quando mi sono accorto di non essere neanche a podio, anche perch il mio allenatore di allora dopo la gara non mi ha detto che ero quarto.  Quella piscina comunque non mi ha mai portato bene n da atleta n da allenatore, in un modo o nell'altro, anche se da atleta sono riuscito a vincere una coppa.    Mi unisco ai tuoi saluti e ovviamente saluto anche te che (non me ne vogliano gli altri perch  un parere personale) nella categoria nuoto e tuffi sei il migliore.  Ciao|`|0sWVeGxqaa	La mia prima gara era una gara sociale della piscina avevo circa 6 anni. Ho fatto il 25 sl e qll dorso a stile ero arrivata 1 a dorso 3. Da questa gara sono stata scelta x l'agonismo e ho fatto tantissime gare dp di queste due.....E ancora ne faccio ne ho appena 4 questo weeckend....... Un saluto a tutti qll ke parteciperanno con me al trofeo amiata sabato  e domenica!!!
8DafRmReaa	A questo link puoi vedere due video che fanno vedere che effettivamente Phelps si  meritato anche stavolta l'oro...  http://www.nuoto.it/leggi.php?leggiID=18...  purtroppo il serbo Cavic anche se ha toccato per primo non ha impresso una tale forza alla fotocellula(che richiede un peso di 15 kg) e quindi il tempo non  comparso immediatamente al tocco...cosa che ha fatto invece Phelps.  Inoltre se hai notato Cavic alla premiazione era sereno e tranquillo,quindi ha riconosciuto lui stesso di aver fatto un arrivo sbagliato...se cos non fosse stato,avrebbe fatto ricorso per vedere se meritava lui l'oro...    ti posso testimoniare che mi  successo anche a me un episodio simile a una gara...avevo fatto l'arrivo troppo lento a dorso e pensa che il tempo sul tabellone non era nemmeno comparso...  si vede che stavolta il fato era dalla parte di Phleps...anche perch  impossibile maneggiare a proprio piacimento i tempi dei tabelloni.    spero di averti chiarito ciao ;)|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	L'impressione  una cosa personale, durante le gare di nuoto non sono i giudici di gara a "stoppare il cronometro" ma  tutto computerizzato e i computer non fanno preferenze.  Come  gi stato detto sopra, il cronometro si blocca quando l'atleta imprime sulla piastra una pressione di 15kg. Magari il primo a sfiorare  stato Cavic, per a premere per bene  stato Phelps.  (la fortuna ha fatto la sua parte)...|`|9uEtVMaYaa	Nono  arrivato prima Phelps.. di pokissimo.. questione di millesimi... ma prima Phelps...  adoro Michael :)  forza italia!!!  ciao baci|`|bs4WWpWwaa	si dice Phelps... ma secondo me Cavic, non che sia contro Phelps (un po' s :) visto che  superdopato). Hanno dato la vittoria a Phelps per consentirgli di fare il suo record di ori e quindi fare in modo che tutti lo seguano aumentando gli asclti. Che schifo!|`|NXv15Uuxaa	no xke cavic era avanti fino all'ultima bracciata, poi phelps ha disteso l'ultima in 1 modo magnifico e...ha toccato prima, ma x poki millesimi...avrei dato l'oro exaequo senza approssimare il tempo di cavic!!!!!!!!!!  |`|wxB6Ynqeaa	ha toccato prima Cavic qsto si  visto.....  xo cavic essendo in scivolata nn ha esercitato abbastanza pressione (xk la piastra scatti serve una pressione di 15 kg), mentre Phelps  arrivato in piena bracciata e  riuscito a esercitare la pressione  velocemente di cavic!!!!!  penso si possa dire che Cavic l'ha persa....

7kSaRRpWaa	domanda alquanto difficile... sicuramente non al mare, ahah  Milano ha diverse piscine ma veramente poche all'aperto e personalmente ti sconsiglio la piscina del lido. Se vuoi unire un tuffo rinfrescante in piscina al divertimento allora aquatica  quello che fa per te... ci sono tantissime piscine anche con le onde e numerosi giochi d'acqua. Se invece preferisci una piscina normale puoi vedere: Bagni Botta, Piscina Saini (dove la sera puoi gustare anche cocktail), centro saini, cardellino, romano, scarioni sant abbondio. doveroso infine citare anche le molte piscine coperte con giardini e spazi allaria aperta: dalla Mincio, alla Murat, dalla Arioli Venegoni alla Cozzi sino alla Bacone. In genere queste strutture (con prezzi di ingresso che variano dai 3,50 euro per i feriali ridotti ai 5,50 euro del sabato e domenica con ticket valido 4 ore), sono aperte, dalle 10 alle 19 tutti i giorni.|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	guarda...io personalmente ti sconsiglio posti tipo idroscalo o laghi vari...per andare a prendere il sole ok,ma per farci il bagno io non andrei...mentre per consigliarti la piscina dovremmo sapere in che zona sei: zona nord ti consiglierei la piscina scarioni(ha la vasca olimpionica e il trampolino per i tuffi)..a me piace!|`|a0f8e0b5ddc69fb72b7570dac818a89baa	Piscina vicino al politecnico, fermata Piola  Oppure all'idroscalo, a Novegro|`|wEJCwQlpaa	alla piscina di saini|`|6Q9EKNmmaa	in una Doccia

4i2k2Bhqaa	Secondo me non devi pensare a quello che vuole la tua famiglia, ma A QUELLO CHE VUOI TU! Per tanto tempo io ho commesso lo stesso errore e ora ne pago le conseguenze. Per far contenti i miei genitori ho fatto la cosa inversa alla tua: sono andata a giocare a Pallavolo smettendo il Nuoto, che invece amavo, e ho buttato via quella che sicuramente sarebbe potuta diventare una gran Carrirera perch, cavoli!, ero forte! Eppure mio padre era stato un grande della Pallavolo e mia madre mi ha fatto continue pressioni affinch continuassi. Alla fine, per mancanza di coraggio per affrontarla e poca autostima, l'ho accontentata, come hai fatto tu. Ma quanto me ne sono pentita! Ho giocato a Pallavolo, s, ho Vinto il Nazionale, okay, ho giocato fino alla B1, certo, ma dentro sentivo sempre un enorme vuoto! E adesso, che ho quasi ventuno anni, ho avuto il coraggio di dire: "Basta!" e di riprendere col Nuoto. Ormai  tardi, ma semplicemente stare in acqua mi d gioia, quindi va bene. Tutto questo per dirti che devi fare ci che vuoi TU e NON quello che vogliono GLI ALTRI. Tu cosa vuoi fare? Pallavolo? Bene. Se hai passione non  mai troppo tardi, anche perch sei ancora giovane! Io avevo amiche che hanno iniziato con la Pallavolo a diciotto anni e con un Talento innato e tanta voglia di Riuscire, sono diventate quasi pi brave di chio giocava da dieci anni! Se ami questo Sport bellissimo, allora provaci! Se non va o ti accorgi che non fa per te, sei sempre in tempo per tornare indietro! Ma non avere il Rimpianto di non aver provato perch io ce l'ho ed  bruttissimo da sopportare! Un abbraccio forte!|`|EE3qL2Wwaa	anche io pratico nuoto.....non seriamente.... sono in una squadra da molti anni ma non mi ci sono mai messa seriamente!!!! nelle tante gare(partecipo per stare con gli amici) ho visto diverse ragazze che hanno iniziato con me a vincere e ho saputo anche il loro allenamento.....non le ho mai invidiate perch solo il fatto di pensare a rinunciere alle akmiche e alla scuola per migliorare di pochi decimi mi fa  impazzire!!! devi scegliere tu!!! dipende anche dall'et e da quanto sei portato per la pallavolo!!!|`|5tsOg1l2aa	Io ho iniziato a giocare a pallavolo intorno ai 14 anni, pi o meno la tua et ed ho smesso circa a 17 perch volevano prendermi in una squadra piuttosto importante ed io non volevo sacrificare i miei studi (che sono la mia vera passione).  Tuttavia la mia storia dimostra che in poco si pu diventare bravi, anche se quando ho iniziato ero davvero una schiappa!  Quindi, se ti piace la pallavolo, non sentirti in ritardo...buttati!|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Io per tutta la vita ho praticato nuoto. I miei allenatori quando ero piccola(tra i 10 e i 13 anni) insistevano perch mi allenassi di piu', piu' costantemente, con piu' testa...io per circa un annetto sono andata in piscina tutti i giorni, tutte le ore che mi dicevano e nuotavo(magari non ero brava come lo sei tu ora...)...poi mi sono accorta che un po'mi pesava(non vedevo piu' gli amici, tornavo stanca dalla piscina e dovevo studiare, i miei discorsi vertevano solo sul nuoto...)e non lo vedevo piu' come un momento di divertimento; lo vedevo piuttosto come un dovere(e un dovere era anche per me ottenere risultati, perch anche se i miei genitori e il mio allenatore mi dicevano "brava" in qualsiasi situazione, vedevo la delusione in loro se "sbagliavo" una gara)...per questo motivo in 3 media ho deciso di non gareggiare piu' a livello agonistico. Ogni tanto quando sono ad esempio al mare e nuoto capita che chiedano come mai nuoto cos "bene" e mio pap risponde con orgoglio che per anni ho fatto agonismo,vincevo gare, ero bravissima ma poi ho lasciato...in quei momenti mi viene un po' di magone pensando alle soddifazioni che gli davo in quegli anni...per pensandoci a 19 anni, capisco che nuotavo piu' per lui che per me.  Ora faccio un normale corso di nuoto. In acqua ora si scherza di piu', si parla di cose che nn centrano con il nuoto, c' un clima non competitivo...e st sicuramente meglio.  Le nostre esperienze sono diverse, per volevo portartela come esempio...ora amo il nouto piu' di prima!|`|BMioOMxeaa	io ci son passato prima di te non   che una crisi adolescenziale pi avere tuo padre come allenatore x te e un doppio sacrificcio a me e successo la stessa cosa con l,unica differenza che il mio allenattore era un amico di famiglia,quando ho letto la tua storia ho visto la mia vita adolescenziale scorrermi davanti agli occhi, guarda e difficile scappare dal quel che si tu sei un nuotatore nato e se non riprenderai ad allenarti con passione perderai una grandissima occasione  vivrai con un grande rimorso dentro al quore,io ci son riuscito a diventare qualcuno, ce la farai anche t. mi son scese le lacrime a leggere la tua storia e a rivivere la mia adolescenza,grazie di cuore ti aggiungo alla lista amici e se ti va ti contatto in privato|`|j4OKiKJCaa	Purtroppo mi sa che nella tua famiglia hanno inteso male il significato dello sport...l'obbiettivo non  quello di arrivare ad essere campione...che come hai detto tu  una cosa stressante, ma  quello di divertirsi e star bene con se' stessi....se poi arrivano i risultati....meglio ancora....io  ti consiglierei il Triatlon ed il pentatlon moderno....sono degli sport dove c' il nuoto, cos, no anvresti gettato via tutta la tua preparazione  e nel contempo si sono delle altre specialit che ti potrebbero interessare...|`|RHb9VbBwaa	Prima di tutto complimenti per come scrivi perch scrivi molto meglio di certa gente di cui mi capita leggere le domande qua e l..=)    A parte questo,io sono il classico tipo che opta per il "fai quello per cui senti passione,per cui ti senti piu' portato",cio in questo caso la pallavolo (anche se non l'hai mai provata)...  Per bisogna tenere conto di vari fattori...nella tua domanda si vedeva chiaramente che adesso,nel vedere le Olimpiadi ti prendeva il "rimorso" per aver lasciato il nuoto e beh,questo  gi simbolo di parecchie cose...-Lasciando stare che io sono di parte (adoro il nuoto in tutto e per tutto =P )- se hai ancora 15 anni,sei perfettamente in tempo sia per il nuoto che per la pallavolo,per devi rifletterci per bene...  Te la sentiresti di "sprecare" tutto l'allenamento fatto fino ad ora?tutte le 5 ore al giorno passate a sgobbare in acqua?  E poi il nuoto  uno sport individuale,dove contano solo le tue forze e hai tu il controllo,la pallavolo  uno sport collettivo,dove vince la squadra,ma pu anche perdere a causa di un tuo errore..(per  uno sport bellisshimo!)..  Insomma io personalmente continuerei nuoto,sapendo che  una "strada sicura",che pu portare a seri risultati,magari se intraprendessi la pallavolo saresti il nuovo Cedric,per sarebbe un lavoro da ricominciare da capo..  Da una parte a me sarebbe piaciuto aver avuto qualcuno che mi avesse allenato cos per bene...per non avrei sopportato la pressione e un padre che non mi parla piu' perch non svolgo lo sport che voleva lui...non  una situazione facile...fatti una domanda:riusciresti a stare senza il nuoto?saresti veramente contento di praticarlo a livello "base" senza quindi nessun riconoscimento?  se la risposta  si,allora inizia pallavolo e fai vedere chi sei!    Ciao e buona fortuna!|`|Ws7WYteyaa	se ti fa piacere pensare che solo impegnandoti saresti potuto andare alle olimpiadi pensalo pure ma non  cos matematico. Se mi dici che avresti potuto fare i tempi per gli assoluti e magari salire sul pdio forse si, ma le olimpiadi sono veramente alla portata di pochissimi, e non  che gli altri non soffrano o non si impegnino abbastannza. I fattori, dovresti saperlo sono tanti. Comunque i nuotatori longevi che ho conosciuto cio chi ha continuato fino ai 20, 25 anni o pi e gente che amava nuotare e non solo vincere.In ogni caso un unica certezza: il nuoto  una parentesi, prima o poi finisce, per tutti Phelps compreso. Non  uno sport che si possa portare avanti troppo a lungo e a volte  meglio staccarsene prima che condizioni troppo con il suo impegno il futuro.Se ami nuotare continua a farlo ma cerca una squadra dove non sia tuo padre l'allenatore e intanto fai altri progettti. sei un ragazzino non studi? anche una scelta di studio o di lavoro realizza le persone ed  pi certa e raggiungibile di una partecipazione olimpica.|`|QLIGT2T1aa	purtroppo nn posso indicarti la strada per esperienza, a me questa cosa non  mai successa ma credo comunque che prover a darti un consigio. credo che il tuo sia una sorte di amore-odio col nuoto. il fatto ke tuo padre fosse l'allenatore ha in primis peggiorato le cose xke magari tutta questa testardaggine nel voler continuare erano anke una sorta di azioni per conquistare la stima del padre e dei genitori...ma io dico, la prima volta che hai smesso era gia un chiaro segnale che qualche indecisione c'era gia. capisco che il fatto che tu fossi portato ti facesse pensare ankor di pi che era quelle ke dovevi fare ma a vote non sempre ci che si sa fare va daccordo con ci che si VUOLE fare. mi sembra che a te piaccia molto la pallavvolo e a mio parere  un bene che tu abbia questa passione, il nuoto  stato con un tuo vecchio amore...che per tua sfortuna era anche la passione di tuo padre e che quindi ti crea disagio. ma la pallavvolo  il tuo amore presente, il tuo sogno, il tuo desiderio e non pensare a cosa potevi essere delle olimpiadi pensa a cosa puoi fare per dare il massimo (o quanto vuoi dare) x la pallavvolo. tuo padre e la tua famiglia capiranno che questo x te  importante e anke il loro appoggio lo ...parlagli a cuore in mano e sono sicura ke  le cose andranno meglio. lo spero tanto x te...un salutone. ciao|`|dgGeXDdjaa	b..adesso dire che saresti alle olimpiadi  un po' troppo...dai non ti gasare cos che tanto non  detto sia vero...non non lo sappiamo io non ci credo molto...

ieUgty5Faa	Normally I wouldn't condone fights like that, but anyone who says the Jonas Brothers are greater than Jimi Hendrix deserves to get his *** kicked.    On the flipside of that, a guy like that will never admit defeat, and has no respect or sense of honor.     He knows, and everyone knows you beat his ***. Go ahead and let people think you're a bully, but you're not. He agreed to the fight and his buddies had to save his *** from you. Good! Let it go, but if they wanna start **** again, just kick his *** again.    All these people here bashing on schoolyard fights, lay off. ****, it's part of being a kid.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	that to me sounds like the most stupidest reason to fight.   you need to grow up and stop acting like a little baby and a little looser.  i think i will have to steal katana172's line here and nominate you for the Darwin award     http://www.darwinawards.com/    you are also a prime candidate for gene pool cleansing|`|C0sT0PPyaa	Lemme get this straight....this guy called you a poo poo head?

Why fight over something so stupid to begin with as it only leads to trouble which is what you have now finally discovered and realized.  All you need to say is that this is stupid to fight over and that you should have known better to do that and turn around and walk away.  Things will probably settle down then and you both can get on with your lives and enjoy them more fully.  You will not be this young forever and your high school years will be some of the best years of your life.  Don't waste them fighting over stupid stuff.  Once out of high school they generally throw people in jail for behaving this way and that is why the majority of adults don't.

QGBSOpt7aa	Yes. While I am a die hard Steeler fan, I also follow certain players on other teams.  Just because you like a certain team, doesn't mean you can't recognize the skill of players on other teams.  I just dint root for them when player my team.      Jerseys I own:    Steelers:  Porter  Ward (2 of them)  Polamalu (2 of them)  Woodley  Harrison  Franco Harris  Lambert  Kendrell Bell  Bettis Pro Bowl Jersey    Other teams:  Shockey  Colston  Moss  Tiki Barber  Vick (though I tossed it out when the whole dog fighting thing broke)    And I recently ordered  Walter Payton  Bo Jackson  Barry Sanders|`|fk30FQz2aa	NO.|`|yZK8NcnSaa	Only Legends! Payton, Montana, ect. Current players always hurt my teams chances of getting anywhere when they do good. So I won't sport their  's. Plus I'm a Bengals fan so that means a lotta players hurt them. LOL.|`|5n0Ir5dEaa	I can't bring myself to do it.    I had a Rod Woodson jersey and never wore it again after he left the Steelers.  After that I got a Jerome Bettis jersey that I still wear.    Don't get me wrong.  I am fond of and respect some players from other teams, but would not purchase their jersey.  It's partly about money.  I don't have a load of disposable income, so if I am going to get a new jersey, it would have to be a Steelers jersey.    Now, if I DID have much greater resources, I might consider it...ONLY if the player was retired.  Maybe a Chris Carter jersey, Eric Dickerson, Jack Youngblood, Earl Campbell or Merlin Olsen.  It would have to be someone old school and kind of obscure.    Then again...NO FRIGGEN' WAY!!!  ONLY STEELERS FOR ME!|`|9i8FzcnYaa	Nope I always wear my teams (Dolphins) jersey. The ONE and only time I did wear a different team jersey was a Ricky Williams New Orleans Saints Jersey for a Katrina Fund Raiser I went to.

They were all on my team when I bought the Jerseys, though. I wouldn't buy another team's jersey.|`|dbpq1wGDaa	Ya i'm a steelers fan, and i have tomlinson, brady, manning, urlacher, favre, peterson|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Nope...never have and never will...|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	My favorite color is green but I would never wear a Eagles uniform or any other uniform of another team.|`|AA11066475	Hell no! where's the loyalty? Only Black and Gold will every touch my back.    It's all good to respect other players and their talent, but rockin another jersey is pretty bad.  I might rock a jersey of a former player, but that's about it. (i.e. woodson, greene, Plax, lloyd)     i mean.....would you cheat on your wife/husband???? then why in the hell would you cheat on your team?      P.S. Jackie Moon...Steeler Nation just revoked  your fan card.  You already have six other teams to chose from. pick one and learn some loyalty.|`|C8v47HIGaa	I'm honestly not quite sure what to do with my Brett Favre jersey...I haven't worn it since he's been with the Jets..it just sits on the hanger in my closet. Only thing I wear now is my Woodson jersey :D|`|AA11086243	yeah... sure... I'm a fan of many players on many teams...    now... there are some teams and some players I won't touch (Cowboys)... I usually like to keep it out of the division...    but I mean who cares if I wear a NFC team if I like an AFC team... oh no... we play them once every 4 years! or maybe, if you're lucky in the super bowl...    EDIT: I would consider it a much greater crime to wear a past players uniform that went to another team... than another player that plays for another team...    for example... a steelers fan mentioned woodson... WHEN HE WENT TO THE RAVENS?... an arch rival? that's like your wife cheating on you with art model and then leaving you for him too!    that's 100 times worse than you wearing like a steve smith jersey, who you should have little to no animosity against at all... who you play twice a decade...|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Not any more! I am from western PA and back in the day you could get away with wearing a Dan Marino jersey! I had one.
LDVEzHsvaa	Sorry, but you must have clicked the wrong section, as this is the motorcycle RACING questions.    Your question does not involve Racing so .....    The best advice I can give you is to post this question again.    You would get a better response in....     Home > Cars & Transportation > Motorcycles|`|AA12071655	My stepson asked me this very question in Dec. 2005. For Christmas his father gave him the down payment for a sport bike similar to those. He got the fastest one of course.    May 25 2006 he was killed on that bike, racing someone on the street. Got cut off and slammed into the back of a pickup. He was wearing a helmet; all it did was make a viewable corpse.    I'll tell you what I should have told him: it's not about the fastest, or the flashiest or the sexiest. It's about having fun going from point A to point B and most of getting to point B in one piece.|`|39j4ON6Zaa	that sucks daniel, like you said its not the bike its the rider... but to answer the original question the z1000 will be faster despite the weight difference|`|nbICXdkraa	the kawasaki z1000 will be faster in both acceleration and topend, my advice would be to sit on both and see what your most comfertable with, the kwaki has a more upright position so will ultimatly be more comfertable, they are both incredibly quick so unless you'll be taking them to track days you wont really notice that much differience between them on public roads.
1jPiAkP4aa	Not only can you, but you should. If you plan on racing, you need to learn how to handle a bike in wet conditions. You don't want to learn while you're in a pack taking a corner at 20 mph.    1. Watch the paint - cross walks and lane markers are exceptionally slippery when wet, try not to lean the bike into a turn while going over painted lines on the road.    2. The same applies to manhole/utility covers.    3. Older roads that see alot of traffic will be very smooth and quite slippery in the wet. A light rain will bring all the oils to the surface and turn city streets into skating rinks.    4. Wet rims will require increased stopping distance. Don't get aggressive in traffic in the rain, give your self plenty of room to safely stop when cars are in front of you, or when approaching an intersection.    It can help sometimes to let just a little bit of air out of your tires, this will increase the tire contact patch, but don't over do it, or you will pinch flat as well as possibly roll the tire off the rim in a fast sharp corner.     After your ride in the rain, at the very least you should wipe the chain down and re-lube it. If you've been out on an epic long ride, you may want to consider rebuilding things like the bottom bracket and hubs, and possibly even the head set and brakes.|`|Dm73FU8Baa	A BOSS CORSA HEY WELL OF COURSE U CAN RIDE IN THE RAIN ON THE RACE BIKE BUT!!!

QmmZcaevaa	I was talking about the New York Yankees the other day with a buddy. I started thinking about there lineup Jeter, Damon, Rodriguez, Nady, Matsui, Tiexera, and Cano (WOW).    Now with C.C and Burnett along with veteran Pettite. All they need to do is go deep in the ballgames and let the powerful offense do its job.    Still anything could happen in East Coast. Just look at the Rays last year. Anything can happen in baseball    My prediction    1. New York Yankees  2. Baltimore   3. Boston  4. Tampa  5. Toronto    Baltimore will be better i think. The offense is there with Markakis, roberts, Huff, and Mora, and two new pitchers Rich Hill, and japanese pitcher Uehara to go along with Guthrie|`|iz5zDFxvaa	With a revamped rotation including Sabathia and Burnett, a great addition to the offense in Teixeira and a few key players coming back from the DL last year, I think the Yankees are going to make some noise this year in the tough AL East, let only the American League.    As for Chase Wright, he was not a top prospect or anything major to the Yankees. He is, however, a lefty and the Yankees sure could use some left-handed pitching on the team to balance out the pitching staff. I wish Chase luck with his new team.|`|nSSKixvCaa	Yankees should do well like they always do before 2008 seasons.    At least, they won't get swept by Mets with CC out there.|`|dvboT2RGaa	A World Series is not out of reach, number 27 to be exact. C.C. and Teixara are definitely big help, and Burnett will help their pitching staff. Chien Ming-Wang will be healthy so that will help. Jeter and A-Rod need to have a big year and all that equals 27. I hope Robinson Cano will break out of his shell and have an awesome year, he has a lot of potential. So if you ask me the Yankees are definitely a contender.|`|f32y9K5raa	Yankees do good this year if they spend more than 400 million on three players.  But the AL East is the most competitive division in baseball. The Rays will almost definately make it to the playoffs(wildcard or division title). I think Pooki3 is hittin the sauce a little bit if he thinks the Orioles will get second(or hes doing a little ego stroking). Id be very surprised if they got 3rd this year although they may become competitive in the next two or three years.  The Red Sox will always be competitve and if Youk and Bay keep hittin well and if Dice-K and Beckett do better this year then the Red Sox will be right up there with the Rays and Yanks.  I dont even have to discuss the Jays. They are lost cause.  My prediction(I'm a little prejudice because I'm a Rays fan but they will definately get the Wild Card)    1. Rays  2. Red Sox 2 GB(Wild Card)  3. Yankees 3.5 GB(Money does not buy a playoff berth in such a competive division)  4. Orioles 10 GB(Just not their year)  5. Jays 17.5 GB|`|Mxzz2my7aa	there gonna win the world series enough said|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Yeah, they traded Wright for Eric Fryer, who's in single-A. Not a big deal, really.    I think they'll do well, though. CC's a very good pitcher, and they have a solid lineup. My only concerns are Posada's age, AJ Burnett's injury history, and the Rays and Red Sox in the division.    They could take the AL East crown this year, though. They've got the pitching now.|`|ARGrcebdaa	I can't stand George Steinbrenner ... or the Yankees ... but I wish he was 20 years younger ... cause his kids aren't smart enough to buy a championship the way he could.

464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	These new hybrid utility clubs are a cross between a fairway wood and a long iron, with similarities to both. They were designed to launch the ball up in the air from long distances and tough lies. Initially these clubs were hard to hit and the public didnt take well to them. But now with some modifications they are catching on like crazy.These hybrid golf clubs are mainly designed for distance control and accuracy.     Many of the big name tour players like Reteif Goosen, Mike Weir, Stuart Appleby, Steve Flesh, Ernie Els use hybrids so they must be PGA approved.|`|mVgY2I2Zaa	hybrids are to normal clubs what the spoon is to the fork..

ynO69lLRaa	The answer is that "there IS no answer"...distance depends on many factors....gender, age, strength, flexibility, swing mechanics, swing plane, level of wrist cock, etc.      Distance also depends on what clubs you are using.   I use Callaway x-12 irons...when I was deciding on which irons to buy, about 10 years ago, I hit the Callaways, Titleist DCI, Ping Eye 2, and several other brands.    The Callaways were 10 yards longer throughout the set than the other brands.   All those brands were another 10 yards longer than the knock-off no-names I had been hitting which I got from Golfsmith about 5 years earlier.   Callaway irons tend to have one or two less degrees of loft than many other brands, so for any given club they will be a lower and longer ball flight.    Now, regarding your situation.    The generally accepted rule is that accuracy is 80 percent of the game.   If you can only hit a 5 iron 140 yards, but you're much more accurate than the guys (or gals) in your foursome that are hitting a wedge from 140, you'll score better.  Don't get hung up on which club everyone is hitting, or feel bad because they're hitting 5 iron and you have to grab your 3 wood.   It's all about score....if you get the little ball in the whole in less shots than they did, you win the hole.   Doesn't matter if you went driver-3 wood-5 iron-putt, a 4 is a 4......    Having said all that....I hope you're still with me..... Most average male golfers will hit their clubs roughly the following distances...younger males tend to hit further, but more off line...older males tend to be more accurate, but less distance    Driver - 205 yards  3 wood - 190 yards  5 wood - 175  3 iron - 170  4 iron - 160  5 iron - 150  6 iron - 140  7 iron - 130  8 iron - 120  9 iron - 110  pitching wedge - 100  gap wedge - 90  sand wedge - 80|`|6Xf0wOgPaa	This depends on how "good" of a player you are (if that's the correct word to use)    Below you will see a list of different ranges for amateurs (men). The first distance is for shorter hitters, then mid hitters and finally on the right big hitters    Club Men               Driver 200-230-260   3-wood 180-215-235   5-wood 170-195-210   2-iron 170-195-210   3-iron 160-180-200   4-iron 150-170-185   5-iron 140-160-170   6-iron 130-150-160  7-iron 120-140-150   8-iron 110-130-140  9-iron 95-115-130  PW 80-105-120  SW 60-80-100                  But there isn't a MUST or a SHOULD be distance, just know how far you hit each club and pick the shot you want to play.    You will even find some people who hit a certain iron really long and goes out of sync with his own average. It just depends on the person but I hope the above chart can assist in your questions|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	Turbomachine is probably as close as anyone will get.....Given that I have never really seen any factual compilation of this data. The main thing to remember is that Averages just don't mean a lot.  I honestly think That as Golfers we tend to think more in terms of distance any more.....rather than concentrating our attention on the actual swing and ball strike.

Wedge55 80 95|`|Gj8JTJGRaa	i`ll look into this|`|bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	there is no right answer to this.  The answer is different for each person.  Basically each clus should be about a 10 yard difference.  So a 4 Iron goes 10 yards further than a 5 iron.  Now whether that 4 iron is 180 or 200 or 150 depends on whos hands they are in.  Even an "average" golfer would have varied differences.  I play with a buddy from work who hits his 3 wood as far as I hit my driver.  Yet our scores are within a few strokes all the time.  Distance isnt the key, and putting is extremely important.  I played with an old guy who barely got 150 off his driver, but it was straight.  And he hit his fairway wood straight and true, and was on or near the green shooting for birdie or par every time.  I out drove him each and every hole and didn't have one par the entire round (more like tripple boggies that day.)    The key is to kind out how you hit your clubs and then improve off of that.  Don't worry about the averate distance or what you think is right.
mG2BCZe7aa	61 points. MSG record. Kobe record: 1.    52-11-10. LeBron James ties Jordan for most 50 point games at the garden. LeBron also tied Kareem Abdul Jabbar as the only ones to record at least 50-10-10 game. LeBron record: 2.    That is one stand point.    61 points is amazing. But many players have scored much more, Kobe himself included, but a 50-10-10 occurence is so rare and so difficult to do only two men have done so. So from another stand point the triple double is still better.    Another fact for 36 minutes Kobe never reached a rebound, what makes anybody think he could reach 10 rebounds hell even 10 assists if he played 44 minutes like LeBron. So at another stand point 52-11-10 is still better.    I can't think of another review to analyze this one, you can believe what you want but from what I'm standing I'm saying that James did a better job.        Hope this helps.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Kobe's performance was great record breaking 61 points but you can't deny greatness Lebron 52,11,10 was more impressive.

Kobe's might be considered more dominant simply because he took the scoring on his back, but Lebron's is more impressive because he had a much larger hand in the offense - taking over, as well as creating opportunities for points from his teammates.    EDIT: How is Kobe having the ball 50% of the time a nod to him over Lebron? That's like saying Chris Paul is not impressive because the offense runs through him. I think that gives an even larger nod to Lebron, the fact that he controlled the ball more often, and had to create the opportunities all around him.|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	i think that both performances were great but its all about the systems the teams run. the Cavs run as system that is run through one player. so Lebron always has the ball in his hands he makes things happen for the rest of the team. Lebron is like a giant point guard everything is run though him. the lakers run the triangle offense where everyone get touches. Thats why very rarely any of the players have more then ten assists. 5 players had more then 3 assists     Also the NBA determined that lebron didn't get a triple double they game 1 of his rebonds to ben wallace.|`|j6NImFHgaa	I dont know. I really love Kobe and I was trying to figure out which performance was better. This is a tough one, dont know.

So let's just say LeBron played great but he ate his words because he clearly did not score more than our MVP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	I would have to admit Lebron's performance was better. If Kobe had at least a couple of rebounds, and a few more assists, then I would say his is more impressive.   Also, 20 of Kobe's points came from free throws, that's something else people are forgetting.|`|WUzgGtAAaa	Yep. Kobe broke the scoring record at MSG.

That's a no brainer! Every basketball expert would agree that Lebron definitely had a better game. I could concede that Kobe has a better scoring game but, Lebron top Kobe w/ a better all around game! Kobe was just concerned on scoring the whole night on that game. While Lebron's play was still multi-dimensional. If you would factor in the assists Lebron made and multiply that 2 pts then, it sum up to 72 pts againts Kobe's 67! Do you all understand now? I suppose those people who still believe Kobe has a better game are ignorant of true team game of basketball. I would take Lebron's game anytime!    Heck, even Jordan can score 61 pts any given night but, he won't have 0 rebounds and lesser assists in a game unlike Kobe. So, stop hattin you Kobe lovers! Don't be blinded anymore!

XUUDRM7yaa	If your fork is losing air every two to three weeks and you're not happy with that, I hate to break it to you but that's pretty normal.  Very few forks and shocks will hold air without any leakage....most people air up their suspension at least every few rides/days, and a fair amount air up before each ride.  (If you're picky about your suspension settings and know what psi you prefer, then you'll air up each ride anyway.....it only takes a minute.)      If you mean the schraeder air valve cap when you say "plug", then yes, sometimes it's normal to get a tiny wisp of air when you remove it.  I've had shocks and one fork that did this, and others that didn't.  You might check to be sure the valve core is tight by using a core removal tool (same as an automotive one and you can get them at walmart or wherever for a couple bucks).  Don't overtighten the core, just be sure it's snug.  If you overtighten it you may damage the rubber seal and create a leak....you can replace the core easily, but just be careful.    An oil change for your fork will run from $25 to $40 at most shops.  If you want a full rebuild it'll be from $80 to $120 plus any needed parts (seals are usually included in the rebuild price but not other parts).   Sounds to me like you just need to start using the shock pump more often.  Your bike/fork should have come with one.  If you bought it from a bike shop and didn't get the pump, go ask them about it.  If you don't have any luck there you can buy them for $20 to $30.    I'm not trying to talk down to you....just saying that it really does sound as if your fork is fine and just losing normal amounts of air.  Two to three weeks is a long time.      Hope this helps some.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Rebuild only if under warranty. Otherwise, the RockShox SID is a far lighter, way more reliable front suspension. A bit pricey- but well worth it!

p4H61jQDaa	I would take it down to 24 to kick out the teams that are taking away revenue every year without getting any better, will also increase the quality of play which would make games more exciting to watch.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	30|`|ViB84hYzaa	26, no more than 28. Improve the quality of play and talent making for a playoff experience almost every game all season long, Increase rosters 2-3 players allowing for most of these guys to remain at the NHL level to gain the valuable ice time for their future role on their respective team and for injury replacement etc. This would also dissolve some of the under performing teams in the revenue department I believe.|`|gVuddCvraa	26! get rid of nashville, phoenix, florida, and atlanta|`|jwPf5rsiaa	24|`|ugth9FDoaa	I would have 30 to 32 teams|`|d4JaNWrsaa	32, add a team in Green Bay and in Winnipeg|`|4e4d8c05edb6613d08e7327f4eec50fcaa	I think we should go back to 6 teams.  You then develop rivalries, get rid of the marginal players and the cities that are marginal markets.  Old time hockey.  You get to see All Star quality players in games that have meaning every night.  This is just my opinion.  I don't enjoy the hockey we see in the present watered down 30 team leaque.|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	Just one.

ThKao2mTaa	They Can't be compared!    The other one is a Center (Wilt) while the other one is a Shooting Guard (MJ)    but if you insist.....here's my answer:  MJ as quoted by Kobe "is the greatest basketball player ever played the game.".....therefore no doubt MJ is and always be better than Wilt.     G0t it? Go0d!!!!|`|HLzS2z9laa	the game was completely different back then, MJ was the best ever|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Both great!|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Well Michael Jordan made sure that the Bulls won those CHampionship games. MJ was clutch. That's what it takes to be the best. Back then the league revolves mostly on offense and the defense then is not even close to the defense today. Plus back then the season is not as long as todays season and there wasn't much competition for Wilt.If Wilt played inJordan's time, I doubt he will dominate the way he did. He will go against Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Dennis Rodman, Dikember Mutombo, Charles Barkley. Great defensive Big men.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	So that's your reasoning of why Wilt is better?    Yes they changed some rules for Wilt, but don't you realize that if they didn't future 7 foot monsters like Kareem, Hakeem, David Robinson, and Shaq would totally dominate the game. With no 3 second rule and goal tending they'd all average around 40/50 points and 10 blocks a game.    All of those records he holds would be the norm for most centers if it weren't for the rule changes and the eventual evolution of the game.    Also, since you bought up the championship issue, how come a guy like Russell, who played against him, is undefeated in game 7's and Wilt has so many loses? You actually agured against your guy.    Anyway, to make a long story short, because this comparison is basically point less, Wilt was much bigger and more athletic then his competition, the game also was in it's developing stages in his era. Michael Jordan is a shooting guard and effected the game in a much different way in a more modern era.    2 different eras, 2 totally different players...ugh...whatever...|`|vFJtmmN0aa	mj is the best ever|`|AA11691454	Wilt chamberlin no doubt.|`|245xte16aa	How do you really compare a 7'0 man to a 6'6 guy? In a time when midgets played giants I guess you can have Chamberlain over Jordan. And 2 championships is a really great proof of how dominant you are right?|`|yZK8NcnSaa	Could really make a case for either. Each was best at their position maybe but you can't say head to head. Just too hard.|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	I don't think you can compare the two. They both played in different eras of the NBA which had different rules and different playstyles. Wilt was definitely more dominating during his time. He was unstoppable, and the NBA was forced to change some of its rules solely because of him.|`|pjRnFrexaa	MJ... quicker, good vision of the court...|`|4DcvpQXfaa	MJ    why? 6 rings better than 2 rings!    and MJ still consistent when he turned old!
e5719bd477639d040f6e38edd147a59baa	try practicing with your weaker hand only.......................  if they use the 2 handed method its usually the left hand slows you down.  25 is good, the old record use to be like 22 seconds unless theyve shortened it..
DPlJiWyWaa	I'm a fellow Aussie aswell that is heavily into American Football.  To answer your question, LA doesn't have an NFL team but California have 3.  They are the San Diego Chargers, Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers.    Yes there is no harm in Aussie Footy, but I love the NFL more :)|`|JAtI5xf0aa	an L.A team there going to be most Lonny's team in the league just like L.A.... they go in get players who act better then they can play football|`|VC5mEULTaa	Oakland(Raiders), San Diego(Chargers), and San Fransisco(49ers) all have NFL teams in Cali    nice glasses|`|BhXMno7faa	California does, it is the San Diego Chargers|`|dCbIHBpGaa	LA doesn't have a team after the LA Raiders and LA Rams both left in the mid nineties.

m2ZC3Fydaa	The bad pommie rugby jokes get old almost as fast as the sheep shagger or rugby choking gestures when in the UK so I guess that is the price that is to be paid for the moronic thinking that comes from the trash of any given nation. OK bleat out of the way.     You didnt say if you are a Pom yourself  but for the sake of this question  I'll assume that you are.    May I first welcome you to NZ and the lovely West Coast. We mostly do like you poms over here regardless of your prefered national beer serving temperatues  and lack of healthy skin glow etc etc. Actually room temperature pommie beer is rather nice I thought. Esp the old speckled hen that is served by the lovely pasty skinned large breasted young lady at the Teddington Arms.    Anyway I digress.  Hokitika is lucky to have an Alcohol themed bar, let alone a pommie themed bar. Luckily for you though, most kiwi pubs have an inherently rugby theme to them.  Id try the Hoki tavern in Revell St. There are better pubs around but it's got a good combination of screens, atmosphere, sky, booze and banter. Just check out to make sure that they will be showing it at the right times, because probably super 14 will take priority unless some kind of pale pommie swamp of humans descends on the pub and threatens to glass the landlord unless he plays the 6 nations.  Even then he might stick with the s14.    either way good luck. Hope you enjoy it and hope  you batter those even pastier welsh wookies back into the valley caves from which they came.    My sister who works as a hotel cleaner just bobbed her head in to express her thanks to your nation for the nice easy days she gets when your countryman stay at her hotel. She says the bath and showers never need any attention after the poms are in town. Not sure what she meant by that though. (Jokin).. Just feeding the stereotype.. HEY SOMONES GOT TO DO IT! WE OWE YOU!    Anyway.. try the HOKI.. its OK. maybe there is better but its a good all allrounder.|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	The Wales v England match is on the 14th February!!!!!|`|0QbAiQwhaa	I would save it for home or something beccause if you dont want AB replies then dont go to a pub and do it...
sVrkjixAaa	It's less than a mile, so even with bad stamina you should be fine. If you need to do it under a certain time period, the only things you can do to improve your chances are getting a good nights sleep, eating a good breakfast, and have plenty of fluids in your system.|`|MnCqBqz5aa	Run at a moderatly hard steady quickish pace throughout the race, then sprint hard at the final stretch... Btw, train swimming, it gives you loads of stamina homie...- XD|`|PJKB5QIqaa	1 day?  good luck.  If you had more time, you'd do a combination of middle distance and long distance running.

I actually got a little choked up inside when HBK immediately turned over and grabbed/hugged Flairs head, as to saw, "THANK GOODNESS this match is over so i can actually show my true feelings about this moment..."|`|VF2D3yTgaa	ric flair vs hbk     was the best match
a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It's kind of ironic because the previous Jets head coach called out Belicheck and started the whole Spygate fiasco, but the current Jets head coach is responsible for the Patriots going 16-0.    Against the Ravens, the Patriots went for it on fourth down, and were stopped by the Ravens defense. That would have ended the game. However, according to the officials, then-Ravens DC Rex Ryan had called timeout before the play, and therefore it didn't count. Tom Brady would later run for the first down, and win the game with a TD pass to Jabar Gaffney.    So, now that Rex Ryan is the new head coach of the New York Jets, perhaps it's time to stop complaining about the Patriots cheating, and instead start complaining about coaches calling timeouts right before a play.|`|djpYRpO4aa	I swore I saw Harry Potter on the sidelines this season. Maybe that's why Cassel looked so surprised every time he threw a touchdown.|`|bYRq1Tu2aa	As much as i hate the Pats, im defending them here cuz they stopped cheating after they got caught last year|`|WrDGhduxaa	That is not the only reason they went 16-0, well may be, because they would have lost a couple of games if they had not cheated.  Since the league let them off with a small fine everything is forgiven and the league doesn't want to talk about until the next time they are caught cheating.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Bill Belichick cheats at Solitaire|`|4KTe107Yaa	I would love to say that's how they beat my Eagles but I can't. But I want to...but I can't  jenn definitely won't be your fwend now.  Oh well...her loss|`|KTp27Fokaa	The Patriots deserved the 16-0. Although they did cheat once, and they would have won if they didn't, and the fact that they should have lost to Baltimore, because a d-coordinator isn't even allowed to call a timeout. But every teams gets their share of calls. This team outscored their opponents by a ridiculous margin. It was the greatest [regular season] team of all time, and deserved credit for that.    I don't really like the Pats but I know the truth.|`|4kdlE54Paa	They have Gandolf the wizard (Lord of the Rings) held captive in a closet.    Thumbs up to those who agree.

zchKmkqsaa	what do I think about it?  It probably hurts... for two reasons, it hurts because it's painful, and it hurts to miss his first All-star appearance.
KTp27Fokaa	I think the Ravens are gonna fall. My reasoning is:    -They don't have an offense. If you can only play one side of the ball, you won't win. Plus, there's no way that defense will be as good as it was this year. They had hardly any injuries in the reg season this year.     - The Ravens always seem to have a good season and then a bad one. In 2006 they were 13-3, then 4-11 in 07, then 11-5 this year.    - The Bengals and Browns might not be the cupcakes they were this year. That was 4 free wins for them, but it could change.|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	The Cardinals because all teams will bring their A game when they play them and I don't  think the cards can't handle that i think they end up 6-10|`|djpYRpO4aa	49ers  Bad coaches+Bad players=Bad season    What's that thing you say?

They are going to have to put up the exact same caliber of play that they did in the playoffs in order to compete next year. Their division is going to get tougher (the NFC West was pathetic minus the Cardinals), so they will have to actually earn the division wins next year. Not to mention they will probably lose Todd Haley, the offensive coordinator, because he will go be a head coach somewhere.     Sorry, Cardinals, but I don't see this all happening again.|`|S6dGc699aa	whatever team you root for|`|0BgzkLdUaa	After the firing of Gruden, I thought the Bucs were going downhill. And Monte Kiffin leaving, of course. But it seems their new head coach Raheem Morris is putting together quite and impressive staff. I have high hopes from them next year; assuming Garcia stays and Antonio Bryant and Michael Clayton aren't traded.|`|GhQbn3pAaa	Atlanta Falcons. Why? Let's look.    You got the Saints coming back healthy next season. Drew Brees is a beast. Reggie Bush and the Deuce are going to be in the backfield. Not to mention that guy named Jeremy Shockey. He's sure to rebound next season. Last year, the Saints lost a few games by a few points. But I think that will change next season.    Next, you got the Panthers who have the best one two punch in the league in Double Trouble (DeAngelo Williams and Johnathan Stewart). Combine that with Steve Smith and you've got a great team. Plus, Delhomme is back.    Finally, the Tampa Bay Bucs, a hard nose, punch you in the face team led by Garcia. This team should be a bit more loose under a new head coach and eager to play for a new face. Despite being old, this team is still managing to be their in the end year in and year out.    In addition to these facts, Matt Ryan will be entering his second year, which is the hardest for all QBs (a la Vince Young, Matt Leinart, Jay Cutler, Eli Manning, Big Ben). Plus, Defenses will realize Ryan's tendencies and exploit.    So...    The Falcons are a good team, but could be heading right back down in the dog house.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Patriots, they gettin old  Cowboys, team chemistry a mess  Panthers, shell shock from the loss to the Cardinals.

And an aging defense for that matter.|`|OJ79IraJaa	I have a feeling Tomlinson is going to get injured again, and cause a lot of drama with the team.  He only has a couple yrs left.

They'll probably sneak into the playoffs again this yr, but after that, ITS ALL DOWN HILL..|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Dallas Cowboys... their team chemistry is not there. the Cowboys play like a group of individuals, instead of an unselfish team.

IZ4GcYgiaa	LITY    You heard me defend the Votes quite enough that I'm Going to say this  . For those of you who want to have the Coyotes to go to Canada :    Go do some research about hockey in AZ and about the state I live since it is not all desert.    EDIT    LITY     I would like to know who these people are as well!  Arizona has doubled it population since 1990 and is one of the top 5 spots in the USA for a business/corporation to move to. Not to mention, Arizona ranks high for new millionares to move to.    We have plenty of business out here where the owners of could take part in.  Some include!    US Airways in Tempe AZ    Scottsdale (world headquarters for these corporations)  Taser International  GoDaddy.com  Cold Stone Creamery( Very good Ice Cream by the way)    Phoenix  University of Phoenix Online|`|4de9c75ae84f69177cff43074c8f8609aa	They are certainly NOT overblowing it... Phoenix will go bankrupt pretty soon especially if they do not maintain a Detroit Red Wings-like record for several years (which I highly doubt they'll ever do)... Hockey in MANY southern cities is a FAILURE! Its only a matter of time before the league repents and brings back into the fold cities that are deserving (like Winnipeg) or open up newer MORE deserving markets (Seattle)... Can't wait!|`|jwPf5rsiaa	LITY...don't you think things have changed for the "smaller market" cities since the "cap" was intoduced. Afterall that was the main reason for the Jets and the "Diques" leaving.      LITY..Agreed..but that was in the day of the 64 cent dollar and with not the compensation package that is avialable to the teams as it is now. I'll admit also that the 2 cities in question would need to upgrade facilities...but don't tell me they would do worse than a few of the other teams in question.    If not those two markets I'd say there is more than enough support for a team in Southern Ontario..Hamilton and maybe another in Toronto. Montreal is a possibility but I'm not so sure the population as a whole would "flock" to anything that isn't "Habs".|`|pOXw1pKWaa	LOL-- after the debacle that happened last year accompanied by the pitiful media slant by The Star, Hamilton Spectator--(boy they got that one right-- Spectator) and the Globe&Mail,  (to name a few of many), I have put them in the same class as the local-- Tennessean, as fishwraps and no longer sports worthy..  They still have people in Hamilton beleiving the Preds will be there in a year or 2.. Birdcage lining would be an honor for these... TSN and  the Toronto Sun are the only credit I can give to Canadian Hockey media as a whole..      That aside, I know very little of the Arizona situation but wish people like Howler and all Coyotes fans the best in keeping their team..  Nashville is turning it around and they can as well... Local investment can do wonders...|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I still think that southern Ontario can support a second team; if you look at the population, income, corporate sponsorship revenues, demographics...the numbers don't lie.  There isn't another Canadian city that can compete with the economic reality though (plus, there's a guy in southern Ontario who has deep pockets).  I can't see Quebec getting a second team because of the tax situation (unless the government was to somehow give the hockey team a pass); the English papers (not the tabloids) say Gillett is looking to sell either his stake in Liverpool FC (which he co-owns with Dallas owner Tom Hicks) or the Canadiens.    With that being said...Phoenix has a bad lease.  If they had one of these sweetheart lease deals that have become the norm with American sports franchises, their P&L would look vastly different.    That they have to effectively give money away from parking, and this $3 ticket "rebate"...that's brutal (the list of teams that would be taking it in the neck on a deal like that is pretty long).    I minored in journalism at university, and the saying "root for the story" is one you often hear (in other words, root for the outcome that provides a more compelling story).  Loosely translated, you are Canada's largest newspaper (let's call it the Mobe & Gail), part of CTV's media conglomeration.  Would a second NHL club in the most populated region of Canada provide additional opportunities (or "revenue") as it relates to several tenets of CTV's reach?  I'd say maybe, just maybe.  I'm not questioning anyone's integrity, but at the same time, some intellectual honesty is a good thing.|`|UoUaO52taa	Yes. The move isn't imminent and theypounce on every possible relocation (The Pens, Isles, now Coyotes). They need to learn it's unlikely even if they relocate they'll return to Quebec or Winnepeg. There are bigger American markets (KC, Las Vegas, I think Seattle deserves more intrest)|`|4EesoL2xaa	Its not being overblown at all.  True, the Canadian Press is very excited at the possibility of having a team come back to Winnipeg or Quebec, and they should be.  But Phoenix is in real trouble.  And the farther they drop out of the playoff race, the worse the attendance is going to be.      In my personal opinion, I hope they move back to Winnipeg and rename the team the Jets.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	Really? Personally, I'll be lucky if I hear something about it every two weeks...
NG6eeCfuaa	Makes sense. D1 schools (the good ones) are about 70-80 percent black. Would make for better recruiting, better communication (and I'm not being racist. How many people feel more comforatable, especially young people, talking to someone of your own race). I think it would be great. Would be tough though. The SEC will not be happy (and once again, I'm not being a jerk, it's the truth). Cheers.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	No, I don't think it necessary.  Given the recent successes and the pending retirement of many college coaches over the next five years, I believe there will be a number of minority coaches hired.  I hope you were not thinking of just black head coaches, then I would be against it, because that would be racist.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I thought the Rooney rule was that everyone had to vote for Obama.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	As long as there are white players at every position on the 3 deep roster of every team. Reverse racism isn't good for anyone involved. If a coach can coach they will find a team no matter what color they are.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!
2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I think it depends on you, how big you are and how hard you are hitting.  Being a lighter weight I used a bag glove that had some padding (six ounces) along with wrapping my hands.  I could hit the bag pretty hard and the gloves I used gave me adequate protection.  180" hand-wrap tells me you are a bigger person and might need a little more padding so that you don't cause problems for your hands.  A more padded bag glove of eight or ten ounces might be better and it looks like a regular boxing glove but not as large.  While you can not use these gloves for grappling or sparring or working speed bags they will save wear and tear on your hands.  You have to remember that damage to your hands is cumulative and you need your hands and the use of them for a lot of things besides fighting so it is best to not cut corners here with respect to this.  People in my hybrid fighting class have 14 and 16 ounce gloves for sparring, 6,8 or 10 ounce bag gloves for their bag work and focus mitts, hand wraps only for speed bag work and a seven ounce MMA type glove for grappling.  None of them want or can afford an injury to their hands or want to have problems with their hands five or ten years from now because they cut corners.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	you just need to protect your knuckles from getting skinned you don't need wraps, anyone who thinks you do thinks they are a ninja.  but it doesn't hurt to use them|`|AA11526615	those arent bad at all but you could prolly go to your local sports store and find somthing in the boxing section just as good but a lil cheaper...i like the 180" wraps more room to get wrist wrapped real good as well, wanna make sure hands are always wrapped and the correct way
qo0kKtvpaa	Because they are bandwagoners. You have to expect them after a team wins the superbowl.|`|SSrsxhllaa	Been a Steelers fan for 30 years!|`|WdlOVQBYaa	their not...|`|66ced41d0362436f7b2208da0b10870daa	If you mean Steelers, it is because a lot of people are bandwagoners.|`|GhQbn3pAaa	Other side of Pennsylvania is where im at. E A G L E S EAGLES! FLY EAGLES FLY!|`|XZGSvVfkaa	I'll agree with the bandwagon idea. I'm sure alot of people who liked them this year liked the patriots last year the colts the year before and now say Steelers are their favorite team because they have won the most superbowls and that helps them sleep at night|`|lPYzU0qlaa	Some of it is bandwagon while most are diehards. Remember there are a lot of transplanted Pennsylvanians (in this case Western Pennsylvanians) all over the country that stay with their roots.Plus why wouldn't you be a Steelers fan?|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	People jump on the Super Bowl winners bandwagon every season. They'll jump on the next winner's bandwagon next season.    Not me, Packers for life.|`|8j70Neqeaa	they are a established good team with a lot of history.|`|RZIV15e3aa	I'm not a Steeler fan and never will be. EAGLES RULE!!!|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	"Yaaaay go steelers!!!" *sarcasm*    bandwagoners *cough*|`|qxw1k0Kmaa	cause they just won the superbowl. Its really anooying when everyone jumps on the bandwagon and suddenly becomes the fan of  whichever team wins.
BNqbOfBsaa	In Greece he is a god. Kick boxing in general I am not sure if he has the "legend status" but the guy is damn fun to watch!      *** I am an american and I am very familiar with Mike Zambidis.|`|55062f1da9e69ceae524d4b7307214e6aa	Mike who?|`|YDpT2ClBaa	never heard of him,      edit, you are mistaking ignorance for not caring, there a big difference. i haven't followed that circuit in almost 2 decades. so i could care less who he is|`|CVT6vf5Raa	he is only a legend in his own mind,  here in american a lot of think he is a looser. and could careless who he is.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Never heard of him.

4kdlE54Paa	It is the biggest football game of the year.  It is a tradition for friends and family to get together and watch the game.  It is an American thing.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	No, New Years would be.|`|oWYs6Btgaa	Kendall is exactly right in his assessment.  It is the sports' biggest game and it's an event in itself.   Regardless of who's playing, it's a time for family and friends to gather, eat, drink and be merry.  It's not an excuse-that usually happens anytime folks get together for an event! LOL  It's a great time!|`|FKN9kBvLaa	For the people who aren't REAL football fans, pretty much.  Especially women (not trying to be chauvinistic, its just what I've noticed) who go to or host Superbowl parties, without even knowing who the teams are.  Also, the Monday after the game is statistically the day more people come to work late and/or hung over.  This is a real statistic, I'm not making it up.|`|X584C3izaa	yes lol|`|oKU7tFWyaa	That's but only one of many excuses.|`|uEIOgxWlaa	Pretty much.|`|c3tADklmaa	What do you think the Super Bowl is?|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	just like Thanksgiving!|`|NG6eeCfuaa	No, that would be just waking up for me.|`|4KTe107Yaa	I don't need an excuse.

bLWHR4fOaa	Since the results of matches are fixed to go along with the characters' personality (fan favorite, heel, etc.) here's the way they'd most likely turn out.    Carlito vs Chris Jericho*: Nobody is better at being disliked than Jericho. He would use this match to make fans hate him even more.    CM Punk vs Cody Rhodes*: Good matchup between two young superstars getting pushed hard by the WWE. I'd say Rhodes wins by way of interference from Legacy.    Edge* vs Goldust: The Ultimate Opportunist doesn't even need any help with this one.    Hurricane Helms vs Jeff Hardy*: While I respect Helms and what he has done for the Welterweight division, I can't expect him to compete with an athlete of Hardy's caliber.    John Cena* vs JTG: JTG might put up a fight by stealing something, but Cena has too much ability and popularity to lose.    Kane vs Kofi Kingston*: Kane is The Big Red Machine but Kofi seems to have found the secret to grounding him lately.    Matt Hardy* vs MVP: Both heels. Hardy comes out on top to play along with the MVP losing streak storyline.    Randy Orton* vs Rey Mysterio: Orton is on his way to headlining Wrestlemania while Mysterio is on his way out. Makes more sense for Orton to win with or without interference.    Santino Marella* vs Shad: Obviously the edge physically goes to Shad but Santino somehow finds a way to win. Glamazon?    Shawn Michaels* vs Shelton Benjamin: You can never go wrong with HBK.    Ted DiBiase* vs William Regal: Inteference/distraction from other Legacy members proves to be the difference.    Triple H vs Umaga*: Umaga has been away for a while and steals this match to keep his Samaon Bulldozer image alive.    Undertaker* vs Finlay: I know Finlay loves to fight but nobody is better at brawling than the Undertaker. RIP Finlay.    Hornswoggle vs John Morrison*: Even though Finlay is bound to interfere and try to help Hornswoggle out, Morrison is too much.    Mark Henry* vs Tommy Dreamer: I know Dreamer still has some fight left in him, but Mark Henry excels at being the bad guy and will enjoy beating the ECW legend.|`|6u2YkXjlaa	Jericho  Punk  Edge  Jeff Hardy  Cena  Kane  Matt Hardy  Mysterio  Shad  Michaels  DiBiase  Triple H  Undertaker  Morrison  Henry|`|XLPcEdy6aa	Chris Jericho  Cm Punk  Edge  Helms  John Cena  Kane  Matt Hardy  Randy Orton  Santino Marella  HBK  Regal  HHH  Undertaker  John Morrison  Mark Henry|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Jericho  Punk  Edge  Hardy  Cena  Kane  Matt Hardy  Mysterio  Marella  Shelton Benjamin  Regal  Umaga  Undertaker  Morrisson  Dreamer|`|AA11482019	Chris Jericho  CM Punk   Edge   Jeff Hardy  JTG  Kane   Matt Hardy  Randy Orton   Santino Marella   Shawn Michaels   William Regal  Triple H   Undertaker  John Morrison  Mark Henry|`|02XHxknUaa	Carlito  CM Punk   Edge  Jeff Hardy  John Cena  Kofi Kingston  Matt Hardy   Randy Orton  Shad  Shawn Michaels   Ted DiBiase   Triple H  Finlay  John Morrison  Tommy Dreamer.

Mi3rHjcYaa	Hey wassup D-Rock, remember me? I was the guy that said he needed to bulk up in the weight room in that one question.    I watched this kid at Texas, and when he played my UCLA Bruins Russell Westbrook (ironically now teammates with him) pretty much contained him very well. He's a great scorer, but his defense is pathetic beyond words, and he cant rebound either.    This guy is just a scorer....thats it. He's so one-dimensional.      edit: The stats you gave us means nothing, because everyone knows he's a Great Scorer, no one argues with that. But he cant play defense worth sh*t.|`|nynlxGmNaa	durant  a mother huckin beast|`|AA11695603	He has definitely improved this season and I wish he had made the all star team. They have an exciting young core of players in Green, Westbrook, and Durant.|`|1N1CB6Fiaa	hes a beast he will be much better next year|`|CNLgFVAxaa	if he would get bigger and maintain his speed and athletism jus like lebron did i would certainly say hey could become the top 3 in he best in the NBA.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	No, he's a teddy bear.|`|xP08melDaa	Dude he's definitely a beast... He went to Montrose Christian High School (best highschool basketball program in the country)    He's an all around good shooter from everywhere even 3 and he's huge and can do massive dunks and grab tons of rebounds    OF COURSE HE'S A BEAST|`|wuDplG1qaa	Kevin Durant is nowhere near strong. What the hell are you smoking? In his draft class he was the ONLY player that can not bench press 185 pounds. 185 POUNDS!!!! I did that when I was in 8th grade,|`|2ZcEepyAaa	No. A beast as i would describe is someone like Lebron who isnt afraid to take it to the hoop with 3 guys on him. Or Howard, or Pierce (some may not say but i think he is, just being a celtics fan and all), or Stoudemire. Someone who i would clasify as a beast would be someone who is muscular and can take it to the hoop and do mostly anything when it comes to strength. Durant is not really strong but if he could bulk up, he could soon become a beast
777bb5cdb16d0cbf43218a2a8f793dffaa	He'll probably be moved to ECW ... so far, he is still under a WWE contract.|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	They ran out of ideas for him.|`|TbRtRvuoaa	send him to smackdown   he would a goood mid carder there|`|kST3xlDnaa	Idk.

fB4RfiCgaa	Tim Connolly. I always knew he was good, but it's rare to see him play for long stretches of the season so you forget what he can do. He's a smooth player with great play-making ability, and has recently been a good goal scorer.|`|21F9EpAVaa	valtteri filppula (DET)    he's really a young, promising player. and if you really watch him he has really quick, creative hands and is quick. he can keep up with datsyuk.    p.s. im listening to DET vs. PHOENIX and i keep hearing about him. he is really doing a nice job with hossa and franzen. had some nice shots and two assists already before halfway in the 2nd. could easily have a couple more tonight|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Sean Avery...    KIDDING!    Probably Jonathon Cheechoo.  I used to just hate this guy.  But when he's not playing Calgary I find it fun to watch him play.    Devin Setoguchi as well.. not that he's grown on me.  It's just cool to see homegrown talent doin so good.|`|xIfvXy4waa	Evgeni Malkin, at first I didn't really like him that much, but how could I not like him after he has led our team this year.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Goaltender: Carey Price   - Over the years I've seen a lot of young hot shot goaltenders come and go in a flash (Jim Carey) or slowly fizzle away (Felix Potvin).  Unlike a lot of those goaltenders, I didn't see any flash whatsoever in Carey Price last year, and actually thought he was over-hyped.  This year, he's shown a bit more flash and has won me over...for now.    Defense: Brian Campbell (I know - the homer pick)   - I never thought a whole lot of Brian Campbell prior to the lockout.  He had speed, and liked to hit - but was out of place all the time.  Since the lockout, his offensive capabilities have improved, and he's become a good defenceman.  He's not in the same class as Lidstrom/Niedermayer/Chara but he's in the mix as best of the rest.  I'm glad he's on my team.      Forward: Vincent Lecavalier   - When he entered the league, everybody had high expectations of him, and he failed to deliver.  For several years, people looked at him to be a leader, and he never stepped up to the plate.  I wrote him off as another  1 pick that didn;t reach his full potential.  The 2003-04 season seemed to be a turning point for Vinny.  He seemed to mature quickly.  Since then, he has continued to mature, and improve his all-round game.  I now have a great deal of respect for Vinny, but I feel sorry that he's in Tampa.|`|UoUaO52taa	Jay Bouwmeester. Liked what he brought to the table but thought he was overhyped, although he's grown on me|`|NEw2JLmVaa	Datsyuk i use to hate him i thought he was just another russian who could only play O and was just a sidekick to Stevie Y and Federov but he really a good 2 way player and maybe top 5 in the game

xKXu0Qb2aa	I hate to Say it , Because I Love ROH , but they Won't Even Come Close to WWE.  Or even Close to TNA.    Why? - Does anyone actually get HDNet?    I'm Just Sayin'.....|`|lTjEyD3waa	Sadly no, while I would LOVE to see Ring of Honor compete with and beat WWE its just not happening any time soon. I am happy though that they are getting a TV deal, I do love me some good ROH action. I've been to a few ROH shows live and many FIP shows and theres nothing like it, the atmosphere and the wrestling. It easily blows WWE out of the water every time but sadly right now WWE has all the casual fans and ROH just doesn't have those. Now could that change? Yes and I hope it does but I just don't see ROH coming any where close to WWE in the ratings in the next few years.|`|smcDn76jaa	I believe it can be competition. It has great wrestling and some appealing storylines. But, it can only be competition if it is on a channel that people have and watch. I have no idea where to get HDnet.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	RoH appeals to true fans and casual fans alike. When it hits primetime I predict you'll see a big change in the way Vince does business. I for one cannot wait until this happens. I love Ring of Honor, always have. More wrestling, less idiotic storylines.|`|hNIyshmkaa	I think people will like ROH because it's different from TNA and WWE.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	I don't know how many homes HD Net goes into. WWE already has major competition, it's called the Ultimate Fighting Championship and has had a reality show on Spike TV for several years. It also has more timeslots on Spike TV than World Wrestling Entertainment has on USA Network and generates more revenue from Pay Per Views than Professional Boxing does. It is also running more and more shows in more states. I like Ring of Honor and have been to a number of House Shows and have ordered several Pay Per Views, however they wil need to continue to grow and get access to tens of millions of households like the WWE has.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	your right tna isnt wwes competion bc if tna wanted too they could crush wwe or

N?o tem nenhum estilo de tcnico. O Tcnico de futebol j nasce tcnico ou se forma com a experincia dos times de vrzea, de campeonatos regionais, 2a divis?o, 1a divis?o, etc. O Dunga n?o tem nada disso. Dever ser trocado rapidamente. Na verdade ele entrou s para tapar buraco, enquanto a CBF ganha tempo para procurar outro com calma -- se n?o pressionar os tcnicos de verdade, o salrio fica menor.   Voc ver -- o Dunga ser substitudo em breve, pois o jeit?o dele o condena para o cargo, ou seja, n?o possui uma srie de habilidades que a fun??o exige.

LEMBRA QUE JOGADORES BRASILEIROS ERAM ATREVIDOS E DECIDIDOS; agora s tem covardes e acho que o Dunga faz press?o e isso n?o melhora nada.

s2MMiZRmaa	Progressively harder striking of the bone you are trying to condition. Your bones become denser when resistance is put upon them. This can occur through either direct impact, or things such as weightlifting.     If you decide to strike the area, begin light. Make the taps a little harder as your body becomes more resistant. Make sure, like muscles, you give your body days off so that the bones can repair stronger. Also, make sure you are getting plenty of calcium and vitamin D.    DO NOT condition joints. I also agree with the above poster. Seek a certified martial arts instructor. I know there are a few styles of Karate as well as Kung Fu that focus on this type of conditioning.|`|LUnscegvaa	sit ups,press ups, medicine ball, running, and using a chin up bar and of course standing in stance and have partners slap your abdomen.

But if the city backed a person with more heart, more winning ability, then they should back LBJ. He is a better player than Kobe, all around, he d's up better, can rebound and pass far better than Bryant, plus he does alot more with ALOT less. You can say what you will, but the proof is in the puttin, and last time I checked, LBJ can at least take a weak team to seven games with the Celts while Kobe got checked in Five games with Gasol on his team, and without another star he never won jack.

AA11979213	No, he's already made them a lot of money.  As far as helping the team, he didn't do much to improve them.  He came here to help soccer's image, but I don't think it worked.  He's known more for being the husband of Posh Spice and having GIANT billboards of him in his underwear.    I like the guy as a player, but he's better off in Europe.    I agree as well, if I were part of the Galaxy, I'd be a bit peeved off at this decision.|`|hFnkvO9taa	Nah  but  he  could  donate  it  all  (  nickel's dime's and  cents  )  to  me   IDE  be  more  appreciative    as  i'm  ruddy  skint  cant  buy  A  single  loo  roll ,  got  some  old  xmas  T.V. guides donated  by  my  neighbours  They  think  i'm  a  really  nice  guy  helping  them  recycle  them these  will  do  for 5 / 6  days (  Ive got to be care full  shiny  paper  slides  all  over  the  place  mind  you  staples  keep  me  smillin .  that's  why  i'm popular  and  s-k-i-n-t  coz  i  look  like  i've  no  probz  )|`|lrhOwySRaa	LA Galaxy have made Millions off Beckham... With Beckham they had the Highest attendance average, the top selling jersey, a new jersey sponsor (Herbalife), friendlies around the world ($$$$$), etc.      And to top it all off it is reported that AC Milan is offering almost $20 Million for Beckham.    *****Keep in mind Beckham's guaranteed salary was $6.5 million.  The rest of what Beckham's contract was money for sharing; Ticket revenue, Jersey sales, endorsements($140 Million)...LA Galaxy were smart to offer this type of contract.  It made Beckham earn every RED CENT that he made.      Join MLS fans in the French Football Section.|`|AA11634270	Yes, what a waste of time and money. Beckham is past it, and US dudes are not gonna fork out for his merchandise..that's too gay while women think yeah he's goosd lucking or whatever but he sounds like a baby.|`|5GRtHQpwaa	It's a tricky one, but sure would be miffed if I were the Galaxy. Everyone said that Beckham went to the States too early in his career, he still had a hell of a lot to offer as Milan are finding out.    It was a mistake by Beckham, but apart from the money he did it for the right reasons in that he wanted to be THE ONE to raise the profile of Soccer in the USA. He's probably realised that it's going to take a LONG LONG time and has now got a second wind in Italy.    As for the answer to the question, Galaxy could be clever. They never paid a fee for Beckham, but instead have paid mega wages - he has earnt the wages and no doubt Galaxy have made millions back already by the sale of merchandise and sponsorship etc - they will lose out over the next year or so for sure, but I believe Milan will pay in excess of 6m which would soften the blow a little. No doubt Becks will return to Galaxy when his stint at Milan is over, so he can resume things then.|`|hviykDAraa	Yeah it was a complete waste of time and money!! Im not really into football and never followed beckahm but it just seemed pointless he cant have really wanted to move there if he now wants to move!!     Im sick of hearing about them, youd think them being in a different country would help but we seem to hear about them more.|`|AA11674745	I've said it before and I'll say it again. Signing Becks was wrong from the start. This exemption rule that was instituted by MLS isn't a good idea because what premier European club will let one of their stars - in their prime - run off to our shores?    Don't get me wrong, I'm a proud American who fully supports MLS. And I love the game. But I'm also a realist who knows that just signing a past-his-prime setup man to play for an underachieving team doesn't not elevate the sport in our country to the status it enjoys around the rest of the world.    I hope MLS has come to understand that their teams need to be diligent about developing the game the way that it did in getting to where they are now. Signing Beckham or other players in the twilight of their careers is a slap in the face to us American fans.

Essa movimenta??o simultanea de bra?os e pernas desenvolve a coordena??o e a lateralidade. Por ser uma atividade que n?o oferece impacto, possui mnimo risco de les?o, isso faz com que ela seja indicada para inmeros casos dentre eles o emagrecimento e a melhora na qualidade de vida.    No trabalho de emagrecimento, a nata??o caracteriza-se como a parte aerbia, ou seja, uma atividade com ritmo constante onde a FC ( Freqncia Cardaca ) deve manter-se dentro da zona de treinamento especfica para este objetivo    (ver artigo sobre FC ). Isso n?o quer dizer que a oscila??o de FC seja inadequada, ela pode ocorrer dentro de um programa de trabalho onde haja tambm intervalos especficos  intensidade do esfor?o executado. A aula pode ser intervalada, circuitada, com picos de velocidade e intensidade. Nesses tipos de aula a FC n?o ser constante porm ela deve ser controlada para que o trabalho realizado n?o tenha seu objetivo final modificado. O importante  que o programa elaborado respeite a individualidade de cada um, uma aula at pode ser coletiva mas, deve-se levar em conta a limita??o de cada aluno.    Se voc ainda n?o sabe nadar, essa atividade n?o apresentar caractersticas de um treinamento, pois ela n?o ser constante. Se esse for o seu caso opte por uma caminhada ou uma bicicleta.    O importante  que no seu programa de emagrecimento haja tambm o trabalho paralelo de muscula??o, os benefcios da combina??o entre esses dois trabalhos (aerbio e fortalecimento muscular ) j foram citados no texto anterior.    Se voc buscar a nata??o apenas como melhora em sua qualidade de vida, alm de todos os benefcios j citados, ela auxilia no relaxamento, alivia o stress, diminui a tens?o, atua na recupera??o de les?es e  um timo trabalho no tratamento de problemas respiratrios.    Dicas teis para uma boa aula de nata??o:    1.      Procure uma boa academia, ela deve ter ambiente agradvel e descontrado.    2.      Informe-se sobre a forma??o dos professores.    3.    Antes do incio de qualquer aula, fa?a uma avalia??o fsica, ela  que vai determinar a FC alvo para o objetivo desejado.    4.      Especifique para o seu professor qual o seu objetivo para que ele elabore um programa de trabalho adequado.    5.      Torne seus hbitos dirios mais saudveis, alimente-se bem e respeite suas horas de sono, seu corpo precisa desse descanso.    6.      Consulte um nutricionista para a prescri??o de qualquer dieta.    7.      Em caso de problemas com a sade procure um mdico.|`|aaea1e7e4ac03ee042ea5c827bf54a2daa	Observar os gatinhos de sunga, no seu caso as gatinhas de biquini.|`|d1e813d14c260dfe606e99041261454daa	Sim ajuda mais no caso dos homens pois faz alargar os ombros e o peito,nas mulher tambm mas na minha opini?o n?o axo que seja la mt bonito de ver uma mulher com ombros largos.bjs|`|3ef51330186f522835d3d64d62a553d6aa	Nata??o  a atividade fsica do homem e de outros animais que consiste em deslocar-se, em meio liquido. A nata??o era originalmente um meio de sobrevivncia do homem, que em tempos primitivos precisava fugir de animais maiores ou ca?ar sua alimenta??o por entre rios e lagos. Actualmente a nata??o , em suas varias modalidades, pode ser vista como um mtodo de recrea??o e um desporto, sendo utilizada para salvar pessoas do afogamento. Tambm existe o nado associado a trabalho, como no caso dos coletores de prolas, alguns tipos de pescadores e aos cientistas que investigam a fauna e flora martimas.    Diversos animais possuem a nata??o por instinto, como  o caso do homem,nos mamiferos este nado por instinto recebe o nome de: "Nado Padr?o Mamfero", este tipo de nado tem principios basicos como cabe?a fora dgua, bra?os (patas anteriores) com angula??o proxima de 90 graus e pernas(patas posteriores) em leve flex?o (realizandondo um movimento parecido com pedalar)este nado ,no brasil,  chamado de nado cachorrinho.

8DafRmReaa	vai tranquillo...basta che ti rechi nella segreteria della piscina pi vicina dove abiti...dai le tue referenze e ti inseriranno in un corso x adulti fatto apposta x persone che devono migliorare e imparare a nuotare...solo che devi sentire in quale periodo iniziano...adesso forse stanno x partire i corsi primaverili...  per potere iniziare a vedere qualche miglioramento(ovverosia stare a galla e fare un minimo di stile libero) ci vorr qualche settimana...dipende soprattutto dalla bravura dell'allenatore e dalla tua volont.    Per il resto nn c' altro da sapere se non che  un'ottima scelta il nuoto per combattere i problemi alla schiena,certo era meglio prima,ma meglio tardi che mai.    ciao ;)|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Ti hanno gi risposto in tanti comunque:  -ci sono corsi in base alle tue capacit in acqua e nella tua corsia ci saranno solo persone del tuo stesso livello  -perch impari a nuotare bene(cio saper fare discretamente i 4 stili),ahim ci vorranno anni...comunque gi dalle prime lezioni ti faranno fare le cose base:galleggiamento con tavolette,tubi,immersioni col viso...  -Nella mia piscina ci sono corsi per bambini e corsi per adulti:di solito il pomeriggio(dalle 15,30 alle 18,00/18,30)ci sono i corsi per i bambini,poi la sera quelli per gli adulti.

Se tu non sai nuotare verrai inserito in un corso ambientamento-principianti dove tutti saranno pi o meno come te, ovviamente tutti adulti ma con et differrenti.    Per imparare a nuotare ci vuole un p di tempo, ma tutto dipende da te e dal tuo impegno.  Dopo una prima fase iniziale, ambientamento, dove imparerai i fondamenti del movimento in acqua cio galleggiare, scivolare, mettere la testa sotto con gli occhi aperti, la diversa respirazione e a non avere paura passerai ad imaprare i 4 stili. I primi saranno stile e dorso, l'ordine con cui vengono insegnati non  fisso per cui non so dirti cuale sar il primo. Con l'impegno in due-tre mesi avrai imparato queste nuotate e inizierai a fare grandi miglioramenti.  Poi quando passerai in corsi pi avanzati imparerai anche la rana e il delfino.    Vedrai che da subito, ma soprattutto quando inizierai a fare qualche vasca a stile e dorso sentirai i benefici di questo bellissimo sport che amerai.    Ti auguro buona fortuna per la tua schiena e di apprendere a nuotare in tempi record :-)    Ciao!|`|fql1PzPEaa	ciao io vado in piscina  a 10 anni nnn sapevo ancora nuotare e mi vergoqnavo a dirlo   poi x mi sn iscritta in piscina e a poco a poco sono diventata + brava  dv vado io in piscina ci sono corsie x i bambini molto piccoli ke tengono il galleggiante e fanno 45 minuti  poi c' una corsia per bambini ke nnn sono tanto bravi e fanno sepre 45 minuti e altre 2  corsie per ragazzi + bravi e veloci e altre due per gli agonisti ke si allenano tt i giorni x 2 ore x le gare poi di mattina o di sera ci vannno gli adulti|`|175F2jUUaa	sono una istruttrice di nuoto federale ...  ci sono corsi per tutti i gradi di bravura ...nn sempre tutte le strutture hanno la possibilit di dividere anche per et ...  comunque il corso  un corso ambientamento e primo corso per chi nn sa nuotare ...normalmente ci sono corsi di mattina e di sera dopo le 8 ..  per imparare a nuotare se intendi galleggiare e tuffarti senza affondare se metti buona volonta e il tuo istruttore istruttrice ti segue ci vuole un 3-6 mesi .  spero di esserti stata utile|`|ae66PTKpaa	bh... io vado la sera in piascina e in una corsia ci sono degli adulti che stanno imparando a nuotare, nn so se da te  uguale, ma cmq nn so come si chiama questo tipo di corso ma s che esiste|`|hSA8StAwaa	Ciao!Sn un'assistente bagnanti e una futura istruttrice di nuoto...Non farti problemi...Per qnt riguarda il corso, gli istruttori tengono conto delle capacit iniziali e nel tuo caso inizierai con un corso base...Galleggiamento e poi andando pi avanti imparerai gli stili di base!Ci sono corsi per adulti e bambini, ma vista la tua et sarai sicuramente nel corso dei grandi!E per qnt riguarda il tempo...Nn preoccuparti, metttici l'impegno e la buona volont e imparerai al pi presto!...Infine ti consiglio questo sport stupendo!Prima di tutto,  fondamentale saper nuotare!(Che figura ci fai con i tuoi amici?!?!?:-) ) e poi  uno sport bello, rilassante, utile soprattutto per persone con problemi alla schiena!!....Vai, nn aspettare altro tempo!!!Corri in piscina!NON TE NE PENTIRAI!!!....ciao....1 bacio...|`|Wy6AvrMKaa	si ci sono i corsi per i gestanti si chiamano...io frequento nuoto al livello agonistico e nella mia piscina li fanno comunque li fanno da tutte le parti ci sono sia per i grandi di tutte le et che per i piu piccoli ed  un corso dove ci sono al massimo dieci persone.....

My favorite teams are in order 1) Niners, 2) Cards, 3) Steelers. It will be a shame if the niners-cards turns into a rivalry being as I like them both. But loyalty has been with the niners since the 80's. (I was forced to secondarily adopt the cards in '88)    As far as the super bowl rings. I dont know that it matters so much. I mean, the niners have had a while of down years. Might as well get mad that Fitzgerald broke a couple of Rice records. The niners need to get good, not all other teams get bad...
b8f4d286b20a45be7b0716d1b226d8fbaa	if you go to Setanta.com and click on venue finder, you will have more success in narrowing down a place near your location.  you can put in your zip and the games you're interested in watching.  Now i know there are more bars in my area that cover the games than are listed.  there are 2 types of Setanta channels- a Setanta sports and a Setanta premium channel.  The bar listed in my area is the one that has premium channel (only bars can order this channel)- that channel shows the most games live.  and the regular sports one (the channel that you can subscribe to in your home) shows some live matches and some delayed... but in prime time.  So i guess what I'm saying is that you can do the venue search but I would call ahead to make sure and maybe call a well established sports bar- they may just have the setanta sports cahnnel.  In Chicago, RCN cable provides Setanta channel in its lineup if you have that, you can subscribe to the channel and watch at home.  i subscribe to setanta through Directv and its 15$ extra a month.  Be aware that most games are on at weird times due to time differences.  I have a DVR- thank goodness- and have it set to record all things related to rugby.  good luck!|`|YDXITLv1aa	look for a european pub. particulary the british, irish, and french ones.    btw    if you want to watch good rugby.. then watch the tri nations and super 14 instead. they're waaaaaaaay better.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	You could try http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-globe-pub-ch...|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	Try and find a bar in the following link!

You haveto be a ****** retard not to like WWE|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Nothing really happens in the macthes themselves compared to the indies you have to wait 3 or something minutes before the macth get's wacthable and that rarely happens these days. It just doesnt appeal to me like the indies do, too much stomping and headlocks and not enough good wrestling.|`|JiCfYfLraa	sometimes wrestling pisses me off because the superstars with the real talent always being misused or have to put other superstars over like natalya,victoria(when she was in the wwe),kane,undertaker sometimes and jillian hall. they have like the most talent and never get any pushes i hate when the wwe does that.|`|XrCc85kNaa	It is faaake!!!

F.E rey mysterrio, chris jericho, and even john cena. They are pros. Most of us know that , but wwe is fake. Do we know that? One thing I like about it is the talented superstars and the charismatic stars. People like christian, shawn michaels, kurt angle, etc makes me want to watch wrestling. They pwn PERIOD.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	Because the WWE doesn't make use of all the wrestlers.

Back TV-14!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ABBkuhgEaa	I watch wrestling every week! And go to all the shows i can.  But the thing i dislike about it is that its not as exciting as it used to be. They have to keep every thing PG now. For instance John Cena was famous for his FU finisher and now it got changed. Also the Undertaker used to have his casket matches and now there not allowed to have them anymore.|`|AA10565336	The constant empty threats bore me.    These men are superbly trained athletes and I would never short them in that field.  However they are terrible actors.    Since the outcome is predetermined I may as well watch "Rocky 1 through 287,421".  I know the outcome there as well but the acting is better.    I also find that many of the fans don't seem to realize this is entertainment.  Just as many fans of Rush Limbaugh don't seem to realize he is first and foremost entertainment.  I do sometimes listen to him but he's a better actor and I sometimes finds something actually worth while on a level exceeding the pure entertainment value.    I hope that helps, and Good Luck on the paper.
4owr19vCaa	Sounds like it is leaking, or was maintained using the wrong type of oil, such as 1.5wt airsoft lube - low viscosity oil / penetrating oil just creates leaks.  First thing I would try is getting some of the proper lube:    Crosman Pellgunoil  http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/access...  http://www.airgundepot.com/0241.html    Or if you have 20wt~30wt non-detergent motor oil that also will work well (basically the same).    Remove any Co2 cartridge installed, stand it upside-down (grip-up) and put 2 or 3 drops in the Co2 nozzle and let it sit overnight.  Then put a drop on the tip of the 12gm Co2 cartridge, install it and fire away.    it might take several rounds of that procedure, it has worked for me on a few old pistols.  If not, you can try and rebuild it, get it rebuilt or just get a refurb'd one (it's cheap about $35  http://www.airgundepot.com/crosman-1008s...  ).    The 1088 is one of my favorite plinkers, maybe grab the refurb, the pellgun oil and maybe a speedloader kit (3 clips) budget permitting.      cheers, and good luck
r5AMG8g7aa	They are crap designed like the other carp martial arts equipment out there. Things like carbon fiber bo and such are junk.

Super Bowl bound baby.|`|Qfb5TwMQaa	no|`|XZGSvVfkaa	I really doubt it. What really helped them this year was the confidence they had gained. I believe that carried them through the playoffs. I was actually expecting them to with with the fire they had lit under themselves, but since they didn't I expect they will have lost some of that motivation and come into next year dull(this happens to the losing team a lot). Though I could be wrong and they could have an outstanding year and go right back, but my gut feeling says they wont even make the playoffs. Sorry. Plus, I just realized an issue, to get back to the superbowl they would have to beat the bears who are going 19-0 next year. Haha cold hard truth!
MkE2kIpLaa	Well, I could go on about rules, downs, positions, and other crap, but to really understand football, you need to watch it.

At that junction, their bench would have been in the game.  They don't care about stats.  They know that learning to play team ball and winning is better then some stupid individual record.  I'm sure Paul will score between 15-25 points.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	i think allen will lead scoring with 35|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Not even pass 40.|`|XrCc85kNaa	He will probably fake an injury to avoid an embarrassment....

Um7mYM71aa	Flames|`|PwED69Isaa	I gotta go with the Hawks. They are 3-0-0 against Calgary this year (along with 10-0-0 currently against all Canadian teams). Hawks are healthy again with Versteeg and Keith back in the lineup. They have outscored Calgary 14-4, as well. Obviously this doesn't mean the Hawks are going to win, but "seeing no reason to believe they will win" seems a little far stretched.    ADD:  When Calgary wasn't tearing it up? Hmmm... They played in early Nov, mid Dec, and early Jan.. Not like they played them 3 times in a stretch of 5 games where they weren't playing well. Game  2 was a Blackhawks win that came after 2 Flames wins in a row, and before 5 Flames wins in row. Who ended that 5 game winning streak? The Hawks. That made the Flames 7-1-1 with both losses coming to the Hawks. I would say they were playing alright at the time.|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	3-2 Hawks|`|3buQDaRDaa	The Hawks will win 4-2 to make it 10-0-0 against Canadian teams this season.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	Yeah, the Hawks do have a great record against Calgary.

I say Calgary 5-3.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	chicago|`|I0g24Jmkaa	Calgary! 4-2.|`|p4H61jQDaa	gonna be a tough game, the flames have lost the last 2 so I would look for a bounce back game from them.

I would say the flames to win.    + flames at home are extremely solid so I would definitely go with the flames|`|hXLFyl0Kaa	Flames 2-0|`|nr29lXcdaa	100% Calgary. They are one of the best teams in the NHL. And probably the best at home. They will when but Chicago will try to keep it close. 5-4 Calgary, maybe OT.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Let me think here.............what happened the last time Chicago was in Calgary......oh yeah......Chicago won 3-2.  What about the time before that?  That's right...Chicago won that as well.  In fact, Chicago has won 6 of the last 8 games between these two teams in Calgary and 7 of the last 10 overall.    As much as I love my good friend Daryl, I have to go with my boys here!|`|Hk0bPDkbaa	As much as I HATE the Flames (lol no offense...just happen to live in Van City). The Flames should win 3-2 OT. You guys can have the Division all I freakin want is a Playoff Spot for our team.    Luongo's no where NEAR 100% right now|`|x9GODf8eaa	I can't disagree with the fact that the Blackhawks have played the Flames well this season. 14-4 I think the score of the three games is. However, there is a stat that I would like to bring up. Currently, the Flames have lost 2 games in a row. This season, coming off a 2 game loss streak, the Flames are 5-0-1. I think that the Flames will continue that trend and win, 4-3.|`|AA10068004	@flamesfan...     Interesting stat but examining it a little more it may be a false-positive. Actually, they are currently in their 5th situation of coming off back to back straight losses, so they can't be 5-0-1 in those situations. I think your including 2 SO losses or combo of L and SOL in those totals there. Even so and you include those as well, its not all that impressive of a "rebound" stat when you look at the teams they beat coming off those back-to-back losses. They beat: Preds, Leafs, Blue Jackets (won that in SO), Avs, Blues, and yes the Caps which may seem impressive all in it's self but that win against Caps came 6 games in to the season which at the point was way too early to say the Caps would be were they are right now. Aside from a fair argument about beating the Caps on the rebound I see know reason why they shouldn't of beat those teams and end a losing streak. Do the Flames have a chance... sure...they have a good chance of winning but it won't be because of this stat.|`|3ec662a6a1af2f43fd6ebedaf185216daa	It's in Calgary, and they are very good at home.

I live in NY but come on now!! Its the knicks!!!  smh|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Blame Lebron James cause that guy is a beast|`|WUuO6wbAaa	The Knicks got outplayed. They don't play good defense. It's like they're set in their mind that what ever superstar come here has to dominate them. It's like they have to kiss *ss to LeBron's feelings to make him want to come here. Honestly, I understand D'Antoni's an offenive minded coach, and he's improved us there, but this team needs defensive improvement. What's holding us up is David Lee's rebounding and Nate's been hitting big shots. These two player's may not be Knicks next season, for payroll reasons, because of their pursuit of LeBron, or Wade, Bosh or Stoudamire, so they could be a lot worst next season. Don't sweat it though. The Knicks are still right there battling. The Nets win over the Bucks last night keeps the 8 seed race tight. And for that matter too, Ray Allen hit a 3 at the buzzer to beat the Sixers in Philly, when down by one. Philly always seems to get those kinds of losses. Similarly though, we came back on the Cavs, like they came back on the Celts. But we just couldn't hold them. I think they held up better at the end of this game than the Lakers, but the Lakers seem to be a better team than the Cavs, although it's questionable without Bynum.|`|gqoIfbH0aa	The Cavs are a great team, I'd be surprised if the Knicks won actually...    You have a great few players though, Al Harrington is becoming a great scorer and David Lee is a beast.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	Knicks defense is horrible allowed Kobe 61 and now James 52 points with a triple double?

XSBNv0iOaa	Wait a while.  Even though I want him to go.  Everyone else is right.  1.Saved Us from Descenso  2.Superlider 07  3.Clausura 08 CHAMPS!    Give him at least 3 games.  Plus its not all him.  I mean he does put Guty Estrada on the left side where hes not suppose to be and he does put Paco Torres on the right side where hes not suppose to.  BUT  common   Benitez is out  Vuoso was out Last week and will be out this week.  And Darwin hasnt gotten comfortable enough to play well.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	yeah, ut i reckon guzzman should have another go|`|4TzNaVnHaa	Nope! Keep Guzman because I don't want people to start saying Guzman for "El Tri"!|`|Zf1jiJoiaa	I don't thinks so..  When they were doing really bad, they hold on to him, and then they were the superlideres, i think they should keep him.|`|nKNiKPn3aa	i think he should stay i mean he is a great coach, but if he does leave i'll bet he gets alot of offers from other clubs  because he is talented. besides he has said he would like to coach in el extranjero and has already send his resume to argentina so all the luck to him.|`|LAdeGGGFaa	i think they should give guzman more time|`|6uc8ROfWaa	no not yet|`|8zgFyfibaa	I think santos should give him more time. He made santos champions,and qualified them to the liguilla.     Its only the first 3 jornadas I say give him 3 more games and if he does bad then he should be replaced. But..... he's a good coach so I think he might stay  .|`|pZdFrAnNaa	nahh mann i hope not    he has done alot for us, of course dont forget he did  have good players,  it wasnt ALL him    but he did save us from el desenso and then made us champions so i say keep him for now    plus he has to keep changuing players in the starting lineup since ainjuries and since castillo and ortiz left and he got 2 new players and la seleccion|`|PowkYTGJaa	No because Daniel Guzman has alot of experience and should know how to bring up the team soon I would wait 3 more jornadas!!

Maybe in the future if he works on the rest of his game.    Good question though, you two.    .|`|MPz9APZDaa	Well Kobe outplayed LeBron, playing great defense versus him despite a dislocated finger vs the Cavs earlier on this season.     We'll just have to wait till Sunday and see.|`|t1uKdzmLaa	I have a feeling this question is gonna be asked constantly until both men are rotting in their graves.|`|Qwx082wIaa	hellllllllllllllllll NOOOOO!

Who has more rings? Kobe  Who has a MVP? Kobe  Who is more skilled? Kobe      Kobe is the better All-Around player. Not the most athletic like LeBron is. But just natural basketball ability. Goes to Kobe.|`|gCjTwne4aa	ok, it's pau gasol  stop making up stuff  and no to your question|`|QBvLgsmNaa	heck no he isn't  Kobe's thee best >=]|`|JD57vHYYaa	No|`|PcF4Za2Aaa	Wrong.|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Totally wrong|`|AA11602830	three championships say otherwise.|`|Zs0tsTuBaa	Hmmm Kobe just cracked a 61 point game on tuesday but I like Le Bron better, I would rate them close to being even though...
D6Llh23Baa	he had 52 points. 11 assists. then the total points he helped create for the team is at least 74 points. AT LEAST. that doesn't even measure the three-points he assisted. and some of his rebounds could have also led to the cavs scoring.|`|mGrkyam8aa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1784863 6dzz5z5...
0yljkLGeaa	he said he wont up one kobe's garden performance but he didn't say that he will make everybody forget about the 61.    lebron really made a statement and it's rock solid|`|KYaM65gzaa	LBJ was the king of the current NBA before this game.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	He already was the KING even before tonight.|`|HOtYR1ksaa	No, he needs to do that with Kobe in his face. He failed to do that at Lakers house, let's see if he does it on Sunday.|`|1LwHRjTnaa	nawwww B|`|1gHVlfbNaa	You're not a real Laker fan are you?    I mean both of you    .|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Definitely not. Kobe is still really the king of the NBA, Just because Lebron has 1 season better than Kobe (current) does not mean he's better. Kobe dominated the NBA for 7-9 years now|`|vdh6cwUvaa	Be honest, NY Knicks is one of the easiest teams to score on. They play absolutely no defense in the Dantonie system.|`|HQWpJhwKaa	Kobe Bryant is the king of the NBA right now. End of story|`|phgWe7Ifaa	how bout win a championship first.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	LeBron had a great game, no doubt. But come on, Kobe scored the most points in MSG history. That's much better than a triple double.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	You don't crown kings in the regular season.  If you did, Karl Malone would be the best player ever.|`|XwZZQbgCaa	Only LBJ knows if he intends to send such a message, yet other than sloppy Knicks defense, LBJ has played an A+ game - based on your memory on NBA records, could you name a player who can score 50+ points and register a triple-double at the same game? Sorry I can't, and please let me know if you find out the answer. Meanwhile, Kobe's 61 is great too, but a little less shocking than what LBJ did.    This MSG dominant story is over-advertised simply because these so-called MJ successors make big damage, but none of them can call himself a king before they win a NBA champ.|`|245xte16aa	Nope the king is retired and is in Charlotte trying to inspire his Bobcats team to improve.

xdbi56Nraa	He played extremely well, the Lightning just have no defense.    Pretty much all the Pens goals came from very close to the net, usually in large scrambles.  Clearing the puck out in that situation is the Ds job, not the goalies.|`|hnMp0sunaa	I agree with Patrick ...and he has a great avatar picture! :)|`|4J8X1aKkaa	I do believe that fine distinction goes to Dan The Beachball Cloutier.      McKenna's a fine AHL goalie, he's just not a great NHL-ready goalie right now. I wouldn't mind having him back on the farm for the Iowa Chops. This hasn't been his year going 11-10-1 in Norfolk, but he was running a .904 so not terrible.|`|d4JaNWrsaa	McKenna is a good goalie. This was his first start ever and he didnt allow a goalie in over 40 minutes vs the 2 top scores in the league. It wasnt all him the lightning team has now blone 15 wins in the season witch is tops among the NHL. It wasnt the goalie's fault he let them keep one point.|`|ULw1777caa	Which one?  They all suck.. If it wasn't for some early save by that kid, it could have been 9-3.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Mike Smith is good the Lightning Defense sucks, there Fowards are good but they need to learn to play D, and back check. Mike Smith has a 2.62 which is pretty damn good.  Oh sorry for the mix up but a lot of people say Mike Smith sucks, even though he is good McKenna is proably good to, its jsut that my point is they have no defence.
q4YGEjS4aa	I am white and have lived in a very small white town except when I went to college.  And every single teammate in high school or college I have had was a teammate long before he was mexican, black, middle eastern, chinese.   From a very small mind hick town,  being on the baseball team won't matter to most.  Have fun and play hard,  no one will care.  And for the idiots that do they don't hate you, they hate what they think your race is.  And you won't be helping them learn about you the person by quitting without trying. You'll never find a situation that will be perfect in life.  Whether you think it's because your black or for some other reason.

I think dante culpepper could take em all tho.|`|TAYErNRkaa	Phillip Rivers  gets the nod. He's a QB, so he see's things develop before they happen ( good counter puncher ). He has a quick forward motion with his trowing arm, and doesn't get tired easy ( good straight puncher who stays busy ), and he's smart ( if there is a fight, he's not showing! )|`|aa30097e8a8b6000ee807296e82bc381aa	I'd like to say Jamarcus Russell, but man....

I've seen the man cry for gosh sakes.    I say JaMarcus wins it all.  That is, if he can accurately throw his fist at Phil Rivers' face.  It would be a hard fought battle too.  It's gonna take some 80-yarders from Russell's rocket arm to rock Rivers' dome.|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	More than likely Cutler and Russell would double team Rivers and beat the snot out of him.

TdrgZwnoaa	I hit a deer with my school bus a few weeks ago. Should we not then give all deer a drivers license too? Afterall; fair is fair.     And as far as hunting goes, our area is over run with deer. I drive a 50 mile bus route every morning and I regularly pass 6 or 7 herds of them. Average herd size is 8-9 deer. And those are only the ones that I see by the roadway.     I am not a hunter but I have taken more deer with my bus in the past year and a half than any one hunter in our area. And the combined roadkill total is more than all the hunters in our area. The problem has gotten so bad that the Government is considering upping the number of licenses next year or organizing a cull. Our deer have no natural predators left and they are taking/stealing grain and causing property damage.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Calling hunting a sport trivialises it.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Go take a bath, I can smell you from here.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Sure, lets put the same value on human life that we do on animal life. While we're at it let's give animals the right to vote, get driver's licenses, and sue us when we hit them with our cars.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	firstly, learn some grammar.  secondly, are you nuts, why would we want to have the animals shoot back at us?  I bet your a peta freak who's just trying to piss us off, leave us alone.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	well then, the animals would be able to vote, drive, pay taxes, be on a jury, run for governor and president, go to local schools, become teachers    i don't think you want a fish or deer, etc being president or teaching your kids    fair is fair right?     but, honestly, if you ACTUALLY understood that hunting is NOT a sport, then you'd understand how crazy your 'question' is   hunting is a way to feed yourself and your family, it population control, its our way of life|`|K5AeQuSNaa	It is only fair that the animals be allowed to shoot back.  And I am all for the right to arm bears.  There are no laws on the books preventing the animals from doing so.  Unfortunately for them, they have thus far shown little inclination to do so.  So I guess the status quo will have to do.  They rely on their insticts and natural abilities, and we go try to shoot them.  Sometimes we win, sometimes they win.  That is why it is called hunting, not harvesting.  As for idiots going out and shooting back on behalf of the animals, that is only for sociopathic morons and pathetic bunny hugger wannabes trying to impress the hairy-legged girls in the coffee shops with their pseudo-intellectual postings on hunting websites in the vain hope of someday getting laid.  My question is which one are you?|`|bB5d5YVeaa	In your case, I think the next time you want to have a hamburger, you should be placed in a bull fighting ring and have to spear the animal in order to enjoy your meal.  Oh, but after you kill it, then you have to "process it" with a knife and so forth.    I mean after all, fair is fair.  Why should you, as a human, enjoy all the creature comforts of being able to stop at any fast food restaurant and enjoy a meal that that cost an animal its life?    And, if you reply that you are a vegan, that is even more beautiful.  I just hope that you grow 100% of the food that you eat and are able to can it in the summers and live through the winters off of what you were able to grow yourself.  I mean, all of those asphalt highways that have to transport your so-called "organic foods" are the biggest cause of wildlife deaths - loss of habitat!|`|xOReEw6Waa	I'm actually in favor of reverse cloning with what ever DNA we can get and bring back Saber Tooth cats and cave bears that make grizzlies look like puppies. I'm thinking that should provide "sport" while decreasing the population of PETA people. Since evolution favors the strong survivors who can defend themselves and their progeny, then we folks who know how to hunt still win, HOORAY for us.   Maybe you really do need to take a Hunter Education course. I define hunting differently than some others, but I've been close enough to deer and elk to touch them, so have a lot of others. I think that levels the playing field enough. I know VEAL is cheaper for me to purchase than wanting to get venison, so it must be something else that makes me want to go out in the woods and get exercise,see new sights, get to relax and bond with my son and friends. OH, they do have "When Animals Attack" shows you can find to enjoy people being maimed and killed by animals. How many people in Africa are killed by animals? How many people are killed in animal/vehicle accidents, plus the billions of dollars. Now, if YOU really want to shoot back at someone the Army has a place for you!|`|nooi0ldjaa	hunting is not a sport, its a way of life. i don't care what Yahoo wants to call it.    i agree, lets give deer and other cute critters guns, and teach them how to use them. that way when peta goes to hump a bunny...bam.  no more peta problem.    life isn't fair, nature isn't fair...|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Lets do this instead to make it really fair to the Animals.* In Hunting Season all Hunters Hunt each other first, last Hunter standing gets to Harvest any Animal that he wants to during Hunting Season Only.* " Makes about as much sense, don't you think? The Animals probably would like to see that happen however.* Better known to them as Hunters Hunting Hunters First before being allowed, or permitted to hunt Animals.* H.H.H.F.*  " Hunting is Fun and Enjoyable, Killing is neither Fun or Enjoyable.".." Society will forever judge Hunters by the Compassion for the Animals that they Hunt for Food, and Sport for themselves, family, friends, and fellow Hunters." All Life is precious to us True Hunters.*|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Please consider the definition of a "sport"...    sport (sp?rt, sprt)  n.  1.   a. Physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively.  b. A particular form of this activity.  2. An activity involving physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often undertaken competitively.  3. An active pastime; recreation.    Clearly hunting has rules, and a set of customs (tradition). Some animals are legal to harvest, and some are not. It clearly meets definition  3. Yes, hunting is an actual "sport".    Hunting is more of a "sport" than farming is. You are harvesting animals provided by nature, just as a farmer harvests crops or livestock. The animals harvested provide sustenance for millions of people around the world. Long before we had supermarkets we had to go out and harvest our own meat.    Just where do you think your hamburger comes from? Did that steer have a fair chance in the stockyard? A deer has the opportunity, through luck or instinct, to escape another season. The steer doesn't. That is why we call hunting a "sport". Otherwise we would just raise them in pens, and slaughter them like we do beef.    If you want a real "sport" please join the military. The guys on the other "team" will definitely shoot back! Is that what you want to hear?|`|AA11729094	Ok, let's give deer guns, it won't do them any good though, they wouldn't know what they were, or how to use it. God gave you a brain and a mind, but it seems you have the same problem the deer do.|`|AA12246425	i love animals and i love to eat them after a kill  i will leave it to the government to regulate the herd population  and will always fight you ignorant animal rights activists|`|dfBwVxXFaa	If you knew what you were talking about, you wouldn't ask this.|`|hcGHj2ICaa	when cavemen were hunting, do you think that they shouldve all met up with the elk and given them spears too?  this is not a logical question, the whole point of hunting is to impose your dominion over the animals, to give them a fair chance at escape, but most of the time man will prevail. this is the way it is with life overall actually. we've tken over the earth how i ask you? by being nice t othe animals and respecting their space? we give them their habitats, but we need space to expeand too. this all ties into the fact that when we hunt, we give the animal ample time to escape, and its them versus us, the only advantage we have is guns, compared to their acute senses of smell, hearing, sight and being able to detect human scent at over 400 yards. who has the advantage here?|`|dpSr0icwaa	yes, but also, to make things totally fair, humans get natual camo, extreme hearing, extreme scent, 270 degree vision, and multiple years of specialized training so they are equal to the averge game animal like a deer    For more advanced hunting, humans get bio-enhanced muscles and adamantium claws like wolverine, so they are equal to the average bear      Truth is, animals already have the advantage.  That is why of deer permits issued, only 25% are successfully filled.  That means the deer wins 75% of the time.  I suggest you actually look into hunting before assuming you know what goes on.|`|AA10182211	Deer kill TEN times more people than Bears, Cougar, Alligators, and Coyote COMBINED.      The animals are well armed already.  Ever seen a child carried off by a coyote?   Or a hiker mauled by a cougar?

Truth to tell, wild animals are better armed than Man.  Obviously you've never had an encounter with...  Oh, I don't know!  Say a rabid coyote...  Sooo very many edged weapons (teeth, fangs!) and there stood I with a little bitty Marlin 336 Lever-action in .35 Remington!  Two shots only slowed it down.  A third round from a friend's .30-06 dropped it, but it got up again (true story)!  Finished it off with a third weapon, a .357 Magnum revolver.  Head-shot ended all hostilities!    How about a Texas-size rattlesnake?  Or perhaps a full-grown Bobcat with fangs and claws?  But that's another story...  Thank you very much for your insight but I'll just keep my shooting-irons.

I'm usually back about 50 yards or so when I shoot a deer.|`|EDc2Ipe6aa	If that is English ,you are speaking I think I can infer that you want the animals to be able to shoot back at the hunters. Fair enough, but you will also have to return your domicile since the land did originally belong to the animals that man has displaced by his very existence .

Truth is, I watch because regardless of how annoying Hornswoggle is, how pathetic the Women's division is, or how little hardcore wrestling there is....it is still wrestling.

I use to watch WWF/WWE in 2001-2007, I would even not do my HW just to watch it. But now it just sucks balls, I watch it if I feel like it.|`|77uc2xXUaa	Because is there any other wrestling on tv?  Yeah TNA you say?  Well its not that exciting when theres like 50 people there and the only talent they have is washed up WWE superstars (besides Sting).  So it comes down to because I like wrestling, its a part of me since I was a child, so theres no other option really except to watch WWE.  I do watch TNA occasionally..its alright.|`|oj4rIETkaa	I just watch because there are still a few of my childhood favorites in action and the Big Gold Belt is still unaltered after nearly 15 years    Today's kids can have their Cenas, Ortons, Batistas, Punks, Hardys and Mr. Kennedys for all i care
dtGInk4Faa	4 down 1 to go!|`|D6Llh23Baa	yeah. lebron played a more complete game than kobe. kobe only looked to score, didn't pass too much. didn't even give an effort to get one rebound. lebron scored, rebounded, assisted and did a good job on the defensive end.  the knicks wouldn't chant M-V-P because lebron is already the frontrunner for the MVP award.

NEtVRjplaa	This is around the time that Cavs and Laker fans come online and we had two great games this week. We're just reacting to them, that's all. =)|`|uxregJ0faa	Well their mostly from Lebron fans comparing the two.    Im tired too though.

MxHIdyVAaa	This is an awesome question.    Al Davis - Clearly the primiere issue in Oakland.  The team is loaded with talent and has sucked since Gannon left (a little before that) .  He still moderates the team and what did they do with the draft in '08?  They selected Darren McFadden.  They already had Michael Bush, Lamont Jordan, Dominick Rhodes, & Justin Fargas on their roster.  I mean, nothing against McFadden, but who the hell is their $80m QB supposed to throw to?  A little scenerio i would like to picture when evaluating Al Davis:  My grandparents are pretty old.  They own a newer pc, digital camera, dvd player, etc.  They still couldn't program a vcr?  My point is, Al Davis may have had some impressive football knowledge at one time, but he's out-dated.  Above all, he's a dick.  Jerry Jones - I question why Jerry Jones even hires coaches.  Well, to be honest i can answer that question.  So he can have someone to blame for the failure of "Cell Block USA" .  Jones has employed some of the sleaziest of athletes in the past couple years, i.e. Adam Jones, Tank Johnson, and T.O.  Jones doesn't understand that what he manipulated in the 90's (lack of salary cap) was merely luck.  You can't pool all the washed up or overrated talent into one scheme and pray it's going to work.  What became of the '08 season was an embarassment to football.  Robert Kraft and Bill Bellichek looked at each other and said, "Atleast we were trying to compete."  If he believed he could win a Super Bowl, Jerry Jones would hire Michael Vick (i'm actually ready for the new Vick) and the Uni-Bomber.    If I had to choose one, I'd say Al Davis.  I've been actively hating Al Davis for a decade.  Not to mention, he's been responsible for one of the most consistentally terrible teams in the league who were once known as the dirtiest.    Another owner to consider would be the Cincinatti Bengals, Mike Brown.  In a recent move, Brown spited his head coach and rehired troublesome felon, Chris Henry, despite his head coach releasing him.  That's pretty ****y.|`|8c5dfb8ff876deaaa25ab74d326f84a7aa	I am going to go with Jerry Jones.  The reason being is for his role in the corporatization of the league. He was the owner that first allowed sponsered equipment with the income going to retain players from his dominant teams. The Nike deal was very similar to the Yankees and the Yes network. The difference is football was smart and expanded revenue sharing and created the salary cap. Base ball allows the top market teams to continue to buy their competitive teams.    Al Davis, Though a little crazy with in the Raiders organization, is nearly alone in voting no on ownership votes that expand the business aspect of the league at the expense of the product. The only other  old school owner to do that is Wilson. So props to Davis on the league issues.|`|9ijwrcTZaa	Al Davis...........|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Al Davis is worse! At least J.J. has the cowboys in the playoff hunt every year!|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	Al Davis hands down. Thinks he is a coach, acts like a coach. Any disagreement from "the ranks" and they are taken to the chop shop. Awful, awful owner living on past glories.    dont get me wrong, Jerry Jones not great himself but although he doesnt endear himself to anyone out of dallas he still wants Dallas to win more than anything.    How about Mike Brown of the Bengals tho. Loyal, honest owner but willing to give everyone a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th chance which has made a complete mockery of his franchise these last 2 season. He needs to put his foot down more for the sake of the franchise.|`|fee5b1d1de4e8ba547c820b12c85a4d7aa	Really?  Al Davis hands down.  Sure Al Davis didn't sculpt a 0-16 team but they have been a top 5 draft team for the last 2 years and have added no talent.  Let go of Moss and Woodson and way overpaid for Javon Walker.  Drafted Russell, McFadden, and Gallery.  McFadden still has hope but pretty much over drafted Russell and Gallery.  The decided to get rid of Kiffin who is going to turn the Tennessee program around.  All bad moves by Davis in the last 4 years.    Jerry Jones....Tony Romo, Marion Barber, Felix Jones, Terrance Newman, DeMarcus Ware, Ellis, Spencer, Colombo, Witten all guys Jones has drafted in the past 10 years, all pro bowlers.  Yea its been awhile since a Super Bowl but the talent is definitely there...|`|TAYErNRkaa	AL Davis. Jerry Jones suffers from some form of ownership bi-polar attacks, but at least he lets his people play. Marcus Allen deserved and worked for that same opportunity in the NFL. Al Davis robbed him of a good portion of his career in his prime. Hopefully Al ( short for Alvin I believe, like the chipmunk with the little bitty johnson that sings so high) will come face to face with the seeds he's sown, to feed on the karma he's due. I'd like to be there for that one.|`|Yn7JMTKxaa	they both suck as owners.but al davis has totally lost it.|`|VJPXWD9Saa	davis|`|JAtI5xf0aa	i would have to say al davis at least jerry jones wins footballs....... games and he has a chance to get to the super bowl .....almost every year .......al davis better be lucky if he can get 5 wins|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Each is worse than the other, towering egos.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Davis.  I mean, they both are bad, but being bad with a winning record beats being bad with an awful record.|`|iGYGJfgsaa	Davis. Jones is at least winning. Plus hes built the Cowgirls a new stadium. Davis expects the city of Oakland to fit the bill for it.    Which is why I see them going BACK to LA once that stadium is built in LA.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Jerry Jones, with the bad economy he will be the next asking for a bailout when the cowboys have nothing but empty seats because he thought he could charge whatever he wanted to. He is on his way with Robert Kraft to wrecking the league|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Davis. Jerry Jones drops troublesome players on his coaches, but other than that he lets them do their thing. Al Davis undermines coaches game plans and week-to-week preparation, and if he doesn't like you, he'll make your life a living hell.    Jerry Jones says his coaching staff is in place. Al Davis's coaching staff is never in place, just temporarily not-yet-fired.|`|0fQk2spXaa	Jerry Jones is a good owner, but a bad general manager.  Al Davis is bad at everything.|`|AA11230418	Probably Al Davis|`|dbpq1wGDaa	Al Davis. Jones is running a playoff contender team, while Davis is busy firing his staff|`|YCwmCDkUaa	JJ is worse...he keeps bringing on cons and having the city of Dallas pay for his upgrades...also, he doesn't let his coaches coach...he thinks he's the coach.    Davis is just old...he doesn't even know he's the owner of the team anymore...someone needs to have him committed...

Mi3rHjcYaa	I've been saying this since his days at Philly.    He's not that good, He's too small to play SG and he's not a good enough Facilitator to play PG.... Double Whammy right there lol.    People also overrate his defensive skills, he's not a good Defensive player just because he gets a couple steals a games doesnt make him an elite defender. It just means he's a good defender on only a couple plays a game.|`|cvd5S7pGaa	yes he is a winner. hes my unanimous choice for MVSC (Most valuable shot chucker) he takes so many bad shots and cant function in a true offense, something the pistons ran for YEARS. his best bet would be playing for a team with literally no offensive options, like charlotte.    iverson is very good, dont get me wrong, but to be great you have to do something other than score.|`|ri4zqzsnaa	Listen AI has had a great career, but he's in his decline...and for a player of his career stature..will never wing a ring. Possibly headed to the Hall. But his days are getting worse|`|OxS3UVE6aa	pistons fan here dude. i agree with you at some point. AI needs to take a lot of shots for him to be effective but with the pistons and nuggets, he can't have that since the are other options that need shots as well. but he is one of the best when he gets hot. he is still effective at some games.
p9RS2Wh6aa	My self I would say Sunline   http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/catpage-L...  Yamamoto Sugoi  http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/catpage-L...    Are the two most supple I have used.  Neither one of them are cheap, but a lot smaller in diameter than other lines of the same lb. The Sugoi I just got this last fall and have only got to use it 3 -4 times but so far I love it, BUT it is a light gray in color and is hard for this ol timer to see at times above the water.|`|qU03Jegpaa	On my spinning gear I've always used Trilene XL.  6 or 8  test. It has very low memory even in the cold temps when I'm steelheading in the middle of winter. I even find it pretty abrasion resistant.    There may be others that are limper but I tend to stick to the Trilene. It aint broke so I aint fixin it.(so to speak)    As a side note, I tried spooling up with XT once, when I was younger, in December or there about and it sprung off that reel like spring steel!  lol  Live and learn.|`|XXFKYz9qaa	Ande Premium monofilament is the smoothest monofilament on the market today:    http://www.andemonofilament.com/product5...

I even use it to tie my own fly fishing leaders in various diameters.  Good luck to you!|`|q8dX0MsNaa	that's a tough one. all the line makers say they have the softest, most limp, most abrasion resistant and so on.   trilene XL is nice and limp but l use maxima ultragreen in most cases. they have a soft one l believe they call supersoft, probably comparable to the trilene. l have used most of the lines made and have gone back to maxima for most F/W fishing.|`|bRXuAgCqaa	Like the guy above me said.I've always used the Berkely Trilene XL and never had a problem.Easy on the wallet and widely available.|`|fSJrgVU7aa	I've used Berkley Trilene XL from 2 lb test to 25 lb test and I've never had any problem with the line kinking or coiling.

They just think anyone who is better must just be better at cheating.  So they're jealous that their coach isn't the best cheater in the league anymore and they lash out.  Plus they're stupid.|`|0mGfwfCpaa	cuz the Pats are whining little bitches.

PRx6j6YQaa	James|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Im a fellow Knicks fan. Our best player is David Lee and Al Harrington. Wilson Chandler, Chris Duhon, and Danilo Gallinari are great for us as well. Do not listen to these guys. Nate Robinson is not good at all. All he does is score and is athletic, but he chucks his shots up and shoots at a bad %. He forces the action to much and makes boneheaded plays cause of his bad basketball IQ. He can not pass, rebound, or defend for crap and he has a bad attitude.|`|N2177Ameaa	It doesn't really matter about what jersey you get, but if you want my opinion I would get a Nate Robinson jersey, due to the fact that he's my favorite player on the team.|`|xP08melDaa	W/e .. but I hope you're watching the Knick's get abused by the Cavaliers... It's pretty funny... although I do think Nate Robinson is a beast|`|nynlxGmNaa	duhon|`|94336c917a716d2f38f3774a5be2c250aa	i would have to go with lee hes preety good and u really dont have that many options|`|yWcPOTsAaa	They all suck, get a throwback Patrick Ewing, Mark Jackson, Willis Reed, or Clyde Frazier jersey|`|ad739ad969fba773bc5e374b5ea9e51eaa	i have a Nate Robinson jersey. the dude is the man. he reps on the little guys and is the teams little lightning blt. and how doesnt like a guy whos 5 foot 8 jammin in the dunk contest|`|83Ayv5Cyaa	good question, i would go with either david lee or nate robinson, you can go with lee because he was the only knick to be an all star canidate, and nate is a good choice because his jersey is a top 10 seller this year. any choice would be a good one lol
IxQzS9SEaa	Haddin should have told Umpire before the batsman walked. He is setting wrong example for the blooming cricketers in Australia. Umpires can't know everything whats happening on the field.

q31jOOhHaa	well there are those ppl who thinks volleyball is like a girl sport.  ppl may say that its gay for guys to play it.  well in matter fact, i play volleyball for my team and i'm a guy.  volleyball is totally a sport. Not many ppl think it's guy's sport also.  it looks easy, but it's not. pplz who think volleyball is not a sport, they better try it themselves, especially when you trying to set a ball or even bump it to another player.  hey, i played volleyball since middle school.  at first i thought volleyball was not much a sport but i was wrong.  volleyball is a sport for guys and girls.  i gotta admit girls play well in volleyball than guys.  they got da perfect set when they are passing around the ball.  also, guys play volleyball more aggressively when it comes to spiking.  dats what most ppl look forward to, is spiking.  the sport of volleyball came from the idea of basketball, which is quite interesting. i recommend those who don't think volleyball is a sport, they should try it themselves.|`|gsYQ9LYAaa	i think its a great sport...im a sophomore in high school(guy) and im joining the volleyball team in a week....its probably because they think its probably easy or something....and its in the olympics so just tell them that and they'll probably be quiet....but yea its a cool sport...and we run alot at my school for volleyball|`|oTeHIpZgaa	You can tell those who don't think vball is a sport that they are "simple and narrow minded".  wearing spandex should not be a reason to discount vball as a sport.  Look at football, they wear pads and tights.  Baseball is the same with even tighter pants.  There are a few reasons people might look down upon vball:    1.) it is a difficult sport to pick up.  it has a steep learning curve, so it turns off beginners.  Everyone can shoot a basketball, or toss a baseball, but its hard to hit a volleyball or pass it, its not a natural motion for most people.  Thus it turns them off    2.) There is much less money and advertisement in vball.  There are only a few places in the world where you can make money playing volleyball.  Thus, the media does not give vball much attention.  example, you won't find women's vball finals (best game of the year) on espn prime time.      3.) Lack of exposure.  Eventhough beach volleyball is gaining much momentum, competitive volleyball exists mostly indoors in a 6v6 format.  So a regular joe that might want to try to play volleyball might not ever find the chance to even if he wanted.    4.) very team orientated.  Unlike other sports, its hard to find people to play with.  you can always find a neighbor or friend to shoot hoops or play catch, but in order to play volleyball, you will need at least 4 people (2v2) just to start it off, and usually thats not enough for beginners because the lack of ball control.      I am sure there are many other reasons, but thats why volleyball players are a very tightly knit group.  I am a male and I played volleyball all my life and am currently coaching girls volleyball in my area.  Once you are in the volleyball circle, you will always find people that share your passion, so don't stress over what other people think of volleyball.  They are just jealous and envious of a great sport.|`|oPjIIywaaa	you know what people think?  that is an easy sport and all can play volleyball  but is not    volleyball has all the movements.....from steps of "basketball to football and tennis"...  has different techniques, like jump high and swing the arms  at once time.....then steps back and forward, left and right  diving and side fall, quickest movements and reaction  eye contact with the ball.    Yeah sometimes I'm wondering "what I'm doing here"  while i'm in practice and we just spike and go around the court....others might be a waste of time  but for me is not    dont listen to other people, they just jealous because they dont know the sport. (not in the yahoo answers - I mean in your school)|`|AA11193773	never heard of that|`|uduydfcUaa	I play volleyball and it is a sport. There are tournaments, there are national champs. IT IS A SPORT. whoever says otherwise are not well informed. It could be because it's on a small court wit 6 people maybe? i dunno|`|jCdY2R42aa	whos ever said volleyballs not a sport?|`|FGZR9RwDaa	i've never heard someone say it isn't a sport..|`|085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	People think about volleyball like they play volleyball.  Most people play picnic or pool volleyball.  And the way they play, it is not a sport.  They stand in one place and bat the ball back and forth.  It is less exercise than slow walking.    The way most people in this forum play volleyball, it is a sport.  One of the better exercise out there.|`|8juUgSK2aa	um, maybe everyone else should take a peek at the olympics before they decide that it isn't a real sport.|`|qaz33UnNaa	i play volleyball, im a boy. when people say it isnt a sport i kinda just laugh because i wish i could see them dig out a spike from a 6'6 hitter i mean really have they seen like penn state vs umm pepperdine?|`|VEScnfoHaa	a. Spandex is used in other sports too. If somebody made up an excuse that volleyball was not a sport because we wear spandex, that is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. We wear spandex for aerodynamic ability. Football players wear shoulders pads for their advantage. Same scenario.    b. I wasn't sure what you meant by "we don't run as much in other sports", but running is a big thing in volleyball. In fact, it's crucial. You have to run a lot in volleyball.    c. When people give you dumb reasons that volleyball is not a sport, they just probably can't think of any real or reasonable reasons why or they're jealous that you can play volleyball or they can't worth crap.    d. Personally, I haven't heard anyone say that volleyball is not a sport, but I have had experience with people saying you hardly do anything in it. I either ignore it or defend my opinion, because they have no idea what they're talking about.    e. Lots of guys play volleyball too and I bet other guys don't want to see them in spandex.    f. I also agree that guys (that don't play volleyball but watch girls play volleyball) are perverts, because we wear spandex. Spandex is just used so we don't get caught on something while diving for a ball or caught on another player. You can also slide across the floor while diving for a ball or jump in the air to block or spike a ball easier with spandex on. I just ignore it when guys make smart butt comments about me or other volleyball players wearing spandex.|`|PxI12ChTaa	Well, I think that when before I started playing volleyball, I didn't really think it was too much of a sport either.  But now, after playing a lot of games, I really enjoy the sport of volleyball.  I love how there can be a lot of fast paced thinking throughout the game, such as you see the other side's blockers move to the left so you set up a hitter to the right, or the hitter changes his/her mind about hitting hard and just tips the ball over.  If the people who said it's not a sport actually participated in some serious matches against good volleyball players, they would understand that it's challenging, plus they'll see the fun of working together with a team.|`|Vc2ObdeOaa	I'm honestly really confused where you're coming from, if people there are saying volleyball isn't a sport. I agree with the first poster, they definitely do need to start taking a look at the Olympics. Additionally, they might one to check out a volleyball practice or two.     If they're still not convinced, you may want to invite them to a tryout session. Those are grueling, I'm a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and ran with Cross-Country the last year but when I tried out for the high school team I was struggling during tryouts anyway.     Volleyball's a sport, through and through. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.|`|cP9MoCc6aa	I know!  I sometimes get the same thing!  I think some guys don't think its a sport because mostly girls play it maybe?  Or like you said probably because we don't run as much as football or baseball or whatever.   But I know we work just as hard....well you know what i mean.  I love volleyball and always have fun in practice.   And if they hadn't seen the olympics before, i'm guessing that's why they don't think its a sport.   Oh and i know what you mean with the spandex and the guys. Its soo annoying. gr.   just want to tell them to shut up and get a freakin life sometime.... ugh.  But anyways, volleyball has the word ball in it like football and softball so they should know right off the bat that it should be considered as a sport...|`|JC2gT9imaa	I LOVE  Volley ball and it is sooooo a sport becuase think of it like running back and forth of a half a gym for an hour. like runnung 10 laps. I mean it's just as good as tennis. And tennis girls wear really short skirts and all so yeah.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	I played volleyball in college. Are you serious they dont think it is a sport? It requires agility and quick movements. You have to jump to spike the ball and race to the ball to dig it once its been spiked. Every college volleyball practice consisted of agility drills and running sprints aka suicides. Sister until you play it your self you have no clue. They dont just stand there and bump the ball back and forth. You must be an athlete to play this game. It takes skill.....I would love to see you play college ball or for a travel team. Are you serious because they wear spandex that doesnt make them athletes? Let me guess you think Michael Phelps isnt an athlete because he wears speedos and swims? Running doesnt make a sport a sport. Does one run in bowling? You still have to have talent to do it.  Volleyball chicks are hot because they are tall and in shape. They Sound jealous to me.

ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	unlike lebron, kobe didnt actually go for a record [lebron went for a triple double by telling his own teammates to let him rebound at the end of the game]  in fact, kobe didnt even know he broke the record until after the game!  kobe wasnt pressured to rebound/give out assists because he let gasol and odom do that [14 rebounds for each of them that night]    leborn saw what kobe did, and at the last seconds of the game, he tried to break the record. [to be precise, when there were 2 seconds left he made his last rebound ON PURPOSE so that it would be a triple double with 50+ points, the last time that happened was by Kareem in the 70s]    lebron had an AMAZING night.  but he did so because he saw what kobe did and he tried to do the best he could and get that triple double, while kobe was just scoring for fun.    so theres a difference.    now, after looking at that background info i just gave you, statistically lebron still had the better game.    but it was cuz of the reasons i stated above.    but kobe had a WAYY more impressive night on terms of shooting percentage.  just look at the stats you gave us! he was REALLY on fire.|`|2wrenQfuaa	Kobe did without taking so many shots and played less minutes.|`|ChuhyvEaaa	Lebron's trip dub  to score that much and to get your teammates involved is the mark of a beastly performance.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	lebron    he's KING OF MSG|`|dMknJjY0aa	not sure, here is some expert analysis    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1782170 6dzz5z5...|`|a0cc26d8f66caee6bd1830dc6e4c87baaa	Ohhh i was gonna Say Kobe looking at the points stats but then i saw the rebounds and assists...

tvuhGTD9aa	Nothing. As with every player, Bonds' statistical record is just that, a compilation of his playing history. Those who would edit history never have an honorable motive for attempting so.    And what "now"? We've had Bonds' grand jury testimony ever since it was leaked several years ago, and since unsealed, in which he acknowledged using steroidal* applications. Having no reason to doubt his testimony, this has been public knowledge for quite some time.    Note that HOFers Hank Aaron and Willie Mays (among others) were known users of amphetamines, and HOFer Pud Galvin was openly consuming a tonic containing monkey testosterone back in the 19th century.    ----------  * Worth noting that THG, "clear", was not yet defined as a steroid when Bonds testified to the grand jury. The torch-&-pitchfork mob probably doesn't care about this, but as a point of law, it is important.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Keep the records and put him in the Hall of Shame.  Anyone who watched him play for those incredible seasons that he had has to realize how steroids(or whatever he may have used), had such an incredible impact on his performance. It was abnormal. It was like watching a 1960's movie where you put flubber or some magical substance on a baseball and it would do whatever you wanted it to do.     Whatever happens doesn't phase me, it's sports, it's fun, an escape, I will go on living, and exhibit no anger.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Of course he should be, and baseball shouldn't do anything with the records.

8wmjYlfaaa	i totally know what you mean man.people need to stop saying he is the best.  okay, he did really good in the regular season, and PHENOMENAL in the play-offs.  but people like Andre Johnson, Burress, Harrison, Owens, Holt, and Smith did JUST as good as he did in the regular season....i guess it shows how stupid people get when they see a good receiver in the play-offs/superbowl.  and the best is probably Andre Johnson, he is SO consistent.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	It's too variable to even debate... Not all receivers get the chances to make spectacular plays. Nobody really thought of Antonio Bryant of the Bucs as a threat until the Monday Night Football game against Carolina where he broke 200 yards and made an unbelievable one handed catch in the end zone. Having said that, and having watched the entire AZ Cardinals' post season, I'm going to have to go with Larry Fitzgerald.|`|AA11086243	moss still... he's dominant... even with brady...    fitz no. 2... he can do it all, but can he put go bonkers for a whole season like moss? and warner was ON FIRE amazing in the playoffs... so it's not like he had no one throwing to him...    andre no. 3... no good qb... but can't find the endzone...    calvin no. 4... in a year or 4 may be no.1 after fitz's domination ends...|`|9ijwrcTZaa	Fitzgerald was underrated for so many years because of his quiet demeaner and playing on the Cardinals.  Now that everyone has seen him play in the spotlight, he if finally getting his due credit.  The only reason Owens is considered 'great' is because he is a self promoting little *****....|`|nr2ZQOC3aa	My opinion is (doesn't play no more) Ed McCaffery.He is the bomb and he took pain like nothing.Especially when he broke his leg.He is the bomb back then and still the bomb now.|`|5STDFx3caa	I'd go with Andre Johnson or Chad Johnson...chad didn't do too much this season, but he's still got the biggest catch radius in the league.|`|KPyUl0YYaa	Larry Fitzgerald.    Hands down.|`|91de20c91e1b0ea1a6448022652ff606aa	Well Randy Moss does not have the same skill set that Fitzgerald does. Moss caught 23 td's because he has Tom Brady throwing to him, because he has Wes Welker in the slot, and you couldnt double team him as much as Fitzgerald does.    If you ask me, the best receiver b4 the playoff or superbowl would have been Steve Smith, he can block, runs excellent routes, is very quick and strong, will give 100% every game (can't say that for Burress, Moss, Owens, Ocho CInco) he is still young, unlike holt, marvin, and although he is under-sizzed have you ever seen him go up to get a ball?? He is like Fitz when it comes to that, he makes great adjustments on the ball and has great hands.|`|Qwx082wIaa	larry fitzgerald      HANDS DOWN!    they almost won the Superbowl because of him|`|ZpPfX9euaa	I think Fitzgerald is the best, and it's not just because of his postseason numbers this year. He is so dangerous in practically every area of the field, and he has phenomenal size and strength. Additionally, he's probably the most durable receiver out of any of the guys that you listed, although you could make a case for Moss too. Nevertheless, his consistency over the years has just been remarkable, and this postseason just reaffirmed that he is the best receiver in the league IMHO.|`|OKpoqhUMaa	all wr are different in there own way speed, agility, hands, boxing the defense out when catching, jumping.   my opinion Larry fits.     hands  isn't the best but he does have the best hands ever in nfl history stats dont lie but he is pretty slow wr....    speed  andre johnson, and randy moss would have to be the other wr recievers that i would at the top of my list their both hella fast..    elevating  Terrel owens, plaxico, and chad johnson are very good at elevating and grabbing the ball at its high point in tight spots... fitz is good at this too..    so thats what i think...   :)|`|HiuNSScLaa	randy moss is lil bit better chad johnson will have a comeback season soon hes as good steve smith is the best your talkin about a guy who is what 5'9 5'10 and still gets it over 2 defenders right moss can do it but hes 6'4 calvin is doing great on a crapy team holt is still making amazing catches but is gettin old andre is the 2nd or 3rd best terrel owens no comment nobody can figure that guy out burress is inconsistent but is very good not top 5 harrison is gettin old    Steve Smith is the best    and im a dolphin fan dont say im sayin any of these guys cause there on my team|`|tq58kZ95aa	Michael Crabtree in a year or two!!!|`|Fs7rCHO9aa	Right now the best receiver in the NFL is Larry Fitzgerald. This is the first time I have him ranked number 1, but after what he's shown us this year, there's no denying it anymore.    They would have won that super bowl if that pass at the end of the first half was a jump ball in the corner to Fitgerald. Why throw it in the middle of the field when you can send Fitz to the corner and lob it up high for him to go up and get? That's the one single play that would have changed the outcome of the game.     Last year it was Randy Moss. He was the one receiver who could really change the way you play defense.     There are a lot of good receivers in the NFL. It takes the best of the best to make it to the NFL in the first place.      It comes down to asking yourself which receiver you would pick first if you were putting a team together and had your choice of any of them. I'd take Fitzgerald.|`|iOrLWyfwaa	Randy Moss is over rated, he really is. Fitzgerald really is a great wide receiver. He catches the ball no problem, even with double coverage.|`|0qypH0bhaa	RAAANDY MOOSSS HALL OF FAMER WHEN HE RETIRES|`|gUzniv0Raa	Im just saying this cause im a lions fan.  CALVIN JOHNSON!  but seriously i have no idea.  the good players all did pretty mediocre this year.  But calvin is a second year,  and he has a terrible QB but still gets 5 in recieving.  Thats amazing!|`|O2jH0yVFaa	Chuck Norris or Andre Johnson|`|4kdlE54Paa	Dude, Fitzgerald is still in the beginning of his career and has over 1,400 receiving yards in 3 of his 5 seasons.  He is on pace to beat Randy Moss, is better than Ocho Cinco, better than Calvin Johnson, Torry is at the end of his career and is sliding fast, Harrison is done, and Burress shouldn't even be on your list.    When people say he is the best, they mean at this time and he has proved it.  If you really think that your list has better WRs than him after a complete 2008 season, then you are crazy.  Sorry bro, but I heavily disagree with you.    http://www.nfl.com/players/larryfitzgera...    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|P93I8CHtaa	neither    its larry fitzgerald|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Someone once asked Randy Moss who the best receiver in the league is, and he just gave him a look like "Who do you think? You kidding me?" So he added "besides you", and Moss thought for it for a while and said Andre Johnson.    Now, this was a few years ago, before Andre Johnson was well-known, so it was a little surprising. He's always had the talent though, and now that he's got Matt Schaub throwing to him instead of David Carr, he's got the numbers too.    Since Andre Johnson is now entering is prime and Randy Moss is getting past it, I think I'd reverse the two. Andre Johnson I think is the best right now, followed by Moss, Fitzgerald, Calvin Johnson, and Brandon Marshall. Harrison, Holt, and Chad Johnson have had great careers, but I think they're nearing the end.|`|gzRZlfpLaa	Randy Moss    Andre Johnson/Calvin Johnson do amazing things without amazing qbs|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	REGGIE WAYNE $ RANDY MOSS|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Calvin is not really a good reciever and Marvin is too old to continue playing. Fitz belongs with the best.    Has Fitz ever been with a team like the 07 Pats?  No.|`|2mbiQfSmaa	really well moss was catching those balls from Tom brady constantly, Larry fitzgerald, has had pretty much a revolving door of qbs. Not to mention Brady had all day to throw.      Terrell owens doesn't make to much of an impact on games any more. I recall a game where he touched the ball in one way or another 20 times. The comboys ran 60 offensive plays, The ball was in his hands a full third of their offensive plays and they still got blown out.  And through all of this he was still complaining about not getting the ball enough.     I think right now talent wise fitz is tops in the league. He is also a great guy with a great attitude which isn't respected enough in the league. Its almost like his stock goes down because he doesn't make bad headlines off the field.|`|BZpF8nSsaa	Calvin Johnson, he has a high school level QB throwing to him, and he is still able to grab the best numbers in the league, imgine how he would be if he had a good, stable QB, unstopable...

br1kwegaaa	The RPI is mostly irrelevant here.  There is a bigger emphasis on how one performs in the last 10 games than the RPI ranking.  Generally, 12 Pac-10 conference wins will cinch a NCAA tourney bid.  Arizona is 64th in the RPI rankings at this moment.  A top 40 RPI ranking is usually a safe pick for a NCAA at large berth.  Being ranked 40-50 in the RPIs doesn't guarantee an NCAA tourney berth.  Dutifully note that USC is  39 in the RPI ranking and is considered one of the last teams to make the NCAA tourney at this point.    In Arizona's case, I would have them out in this moment.  They are 0-6 on the road this season.  The NCAA tournament selection committe does play a sharp focus on the road won-loss record since all games in the NCAA tourney are considered road games.  They are also 1-4 vs. Pac-10 teams w/ a winning conference record so far this year.  You are correct to point out their big wins.  But they need to improve on the road and win at least a couple of other games vs. quality foes before they are seriously considered a tourney quality team.|`|qJwLCjK5aa	WASHINGTON DA BOMB  Arizona probably needs to beat all the easy Pac-10 teams like Ore.St,Oregon (if they don't beat Oregon they won't stand a chance in the Big Dance) and Stanford. If they beat USC Arizona St. and Cal along with the others I mentioned I think they could make the tourney.    My PAC-10 Teams in the Big Dance are:  Washington  Cal  UCLA  Arizona  Arizona St.  and possibly Wash.St

t1uKdzmLaa	I have respect for his game; his prime (IMO) was when he played with the Spurs. Oh wow, did he do so much for that team...especially during the playoffs. He is a very valuable team mate (for any team he belongs) and has proven to be reliable for the majority of his career. So, congrats to him with that triple-double...well deserved.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	Because he doesn't play for the Lakers.  Some people think Kobe and the Lakers are the only things that matter in this world.      I think he's a great story.  He is a guy that was an outcast and a pariah in Indiana.  He's managed to turn his life around and be named a team captain.  He is now the leader of the team, and a great influence on the younger players.  Nobody is saying he is a superstar, or that the Warriors are going to make a playoff run.  The fans are simply showing a little love for the guy, and some people can't deal with it.

The fitness training will come in handy on my show when breaking up fights between hookers          7.  I'm allergic to sequins          6.  You do much better if you take the vitamins supplied by Barry Bonds' trainer          5.  The definition of "star" has really loosened up          4.

Seriously? is this even a question?|`|nZhjosjZaa	Lebron's performance was better, he had 20 in the first quarter, 2 ahead of Bryant at the time. he could have kept the pace if he wanted to but he decided not to. Kobe had an offensive mind set that game, note the 3 assists. When New York missed their shots, Lebron would stay back and secure the rebound then look for an open teammate, on the other hand, Kobe would already be leading the break to try and score an easy bucket. If Lebron let Z and Big Ben worry about getting the rebounds and Mo worry about finding open teammates, he would have gotten way more points.
ZAh8CEoGaa	It should be the highest.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	I think that might be it...Lol|`|fuYYRJXtaa	I'm pretty sure 52 is the most with a triple double...

While the IOC has rules about athletes using drugs during the competition this falls outside of their jurisdiction and authority.     Ross Rebagliati ,who won a gold medal in snowboarding at the 1998 Winter Olympics, was originally stripped of his medal as he tested positive for marijuana.

2s244jGgaa	Maybey Peyton was born 18 years ago and Eli was born 10 years ago. That usually makes sense.|`|pPyaUCLHaa	Peyton wears 18 because that's what his brother Cooper wore in high school. He was a standout WR, but he got diagnosed with a spine condition that forced him to retire, so he never made it to the college or pro level. (Edit: The person above me is correct that he wore 16 in college, but he made the switch to 18 to honour Cooper, not because 16 was retired. 16 is an active number in the Colts organization; Johnny Unitas actually wore 19, so 19 is retired)    I don't think there's any story behind Eli wearing 10, I think he just likes the number. He wore it at Ole Miss, and I believe turned down Ole Miss's offer to bring Archie's (their father) number out of retirement.|`|mXFOru11aa	hang on am i still in the aussie rules section|`|HimBbU6caa	Why is this in Australian rules?    Peyton wore 16 in college, but he can't wear that number with the colts because it belongs to the late great Johnny Unitas. I believe Eli wore 10 at Ole Miss.    Edit: to the guy under me. I can't believe I screwed that up! I'm from New Orleans and I forgot about Cooper wearing 18 in high school at Newman. I screwed up Johnny U's number too.

Get help from someone else or fight him yourself (even if you lose), but don't let him mess with you.  Even if he kicks your butt, he'll respect you deep down, and so will everyone else.  And most importantly, so will YOU.

Ez4d9g3vaa	You may want to delete this question and re-post it in a different section.  Because of the word "flames" (the name of a hockey team), it got directed to the hockey section. You are not likely to get the answer you are looking for here.
mG2BCZe7aa	You know what you should question Mike D. why he didn't try to improve their defense after they got dropped by 61? Now they got dropped 52-11-10. How much more should the Knicks endure? I felt that after a 100 point spanking from Wilt Chamberlain the Knicks of old returned the favor by getting the championship off Chamberlain's Lakers expense. Knicks was about retaliation... And the humiliation is being brought down at the Knicks home court where it should have been a friendly environment.

tZm19KRJaa	The transfer season is opened twice a year. First time (from January 1-February 1) its open for new year shopping and mid season upgrade (usually for injuries). And the second time the transfer season opens after the Champions League Final which is supposed to be the last competitive game for Europe's Club Football. June 1 opens the transfer period. Summer training starts and teams tend to upgrade with new signings (lots of gossip during the summer, everyone wants to buy everyone, like an american soap-opera). The transfer season is opened throughout the summer. It closed in the first month of the Europe's league play usually around September 1.      Hopefully this answers your question.

Imagine Kobe in Cleveland and LeBron in LA......Kobe will be just like Allen Iverson in Philly....Ballhog.|`|Uyup7lBDaa	Lebron's triple double..he worked harder on defense, he involved his team.    Against a defensive minded team..who do you think would've won ?|`|XwZZQbgCaa	LBJ - based on your memory on NBA records, could you name a player who can score 50+ points and register a triple-double at the same game? Sorry I can't - and I firmly believe this is also a record which LBJ can pround of.|`|z43ao3eTaa	The triple double for sure. Scoring 61 points is amazing in itself, but when you compare it with someone who only scored nine points less than that, yet had 11 assists and 10 rebounds, it's rather hard to overlook the triple double. And it's hilarious some of the excuses people are coming up with to defend Kobe's lack of rebounds and minimal assists. Enough already. Just give credit where its due.|`|KYaM65gzaa	LBJ's.  because teammate like when youre as good as he is and still get 11 assists but they dont like standing at the three watching you do everything.|`|mG2BCZe7aa	You saw how difficult it was for Kobe to get at least 5 assists and 5 rebounds while scoring that much... The degree of difficulty that LeBron did is definitely up there.    Quantity wise Kobe's record are better than anyone in this current MSG, But quality wise you can't compare Jordan's 55 points or Bernard's 60 point outbursts... By pouring in 52 points after Kobe's 61 it only proves how easy it was to score against D'Antoni's Knicks not in the same quality of opposition a Pat Riley or Patrick Ewing led Knicks could offer.        Hope this helps.|`|OKpoqhUMaa	61 pts is amazing on an individual effort but lebron did an outstanding job sharing the ball with his teammates its a team sport so I say    LEBRON|`|Qwx082wIaa	you guys have no idea what your talking about!    KOBE ALL DAY!!|`|piZ4xDBqaa	61 is nice, but the rest of his stat line sucked.  3 assists?  0 rebounds?  Seriously, how can a player as good as Kobe is play 37 minutes and not get a single rebound?

0CKJfjrlaa	I find when I think about breathing, I mess up. The trick is to not think about it-- to just breathe like normal.  It's hard, but after a while you get used to it.   And a lot of different people have a lot of views on "in through the nose out through the mouth" etc. but its different for everyone and its best if you try and do it yourself. :)  Hope this helped :)|`|QYzJwtANaa	in and out through your mouth and nose at the  same time....it sounds impossible, but its possible. the reason for this is since your breathing through both passageways you are getting more oxygen and let out the carbon dioxide faster.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	I just breathe through my mouth.  I've never found it uncomfortable?|`|phkXqQ7Uaa	In through the nose....and out through the mouth.    Breathing through your nose is a good way to do it (we were told this when we had to do cross country), because you use less energy and it makes it easier to breath.    Hope this helps!!! =D|`|0sW0GL93aa	it really depends on the person.  some of my friends can breathe through their mouth and do fine.  some of my friends have to breathe in/nose out/mouth  me on the other hand, i have to breathe in and out my nose like normal or my lungs start to cramp up.   just play around with diff. breathing styles and find which one fits your body best.  good luck!(:|`|DvEpetxOaa	This is a debate between all cross country runners. It also depends on the climate if you are running in the cold you only want to breathe through your nose so that the air has a chance to warm up before it reaches your lungs. But in gym what works best is two breaths through the mouth and one out through the nose. Also if you get a side cramp breathe out your mouth for as long as you can without another breathe this will help the cramp. Keep it going.|`|0ffa3071ec5d97e40f2988e5bf8d9e8faa	Also check with your doctor to see if you have exercise induced asthma or asthma.  The better shape one becomes the more consistent the breathing becomes.
gTpOTYFvaa	zone defense wouldn't really work with 3 on 3.  if you left one man up top, there's just too much area to cover to guard 2 shooters (if the team can hit long range jumpers).  if you left one man down low, he'd be hard pressed to get any offensive rebounds, and covering 2 men down low is practically impossible.    best to stick with your man defense.  continue to crash the boards.  set some screens.  move without the ball.  all that crap.|`|9GSBu6wPaa	i agree wit the dude|`|VghVdPfsaa	Hmm, well you could go with a 2-1 or 1-2 zone defense depending on the other team. If the team has better outside shooters, go with a 2-1 so you have 2 people covering the top of the key. If they are better post players and better at working the ball into the middle, go with a 1-2 so youve got 2 people in the paint area. But with a 3 on 3, I would stick with man to man.     For offense, I think the basic pick and rolls and screens should work well enough. Just make sure to spread the floor a bit. Good luck.

vi1bbvCXaa	kickboxing = bread  jiu jitsu = tuna  mma = tuna sandwich  which one would u choose? personally, i would go 4 jiu jitsu because i already know how to strike n jiu jitsu is REALLY FUN. but then again ur quite skinny so i would suggest u 2 go 4 mma|`|ToIKcUdCaa	jujitsu hands down, after that, after you have learnt alot, its easy to pick up kicking and punching and ground and pound|`|I6T4mDPsaa	I'd suggest you just take MMA , it does have kickboxing and JJ blended into it.|`|w74qWx0raa	MMA- Jack of all trades, master of none...I love that quote|`|BbK0fA4Laa	I would say MMA. Your instructor should have training in many different arts though. An MMA instructor that's one dimensional wont help you. A good MMA instructor will know some boxing, jiu jitsu, wrestling, etc. and will have extensive training and background in those arts.|`|bCp9wZgSaa	Only you know the answer to that question. There is NO such thing as a best martial art to learn. The thing is the best martial art for YOU to learn. For some MMA is the most practical for others it will be jiu jitsu. It all depends on what you want to get out of the particular, as well as your personality. For example if you are an aggresive person  and a real bang em up kind of guy MMA would be could for you, while on the other hand if you are more passive then something like Judo would be best for you. Think on this a while, go see all 3 in action and the decision will come to you, especially if you have a chance to  participate in them a little bit.    Lastly in the end all of the arts are nearly the same because they all use the human body and there is just only so many things the human body can do, and as humans we learn one thing but we adapt and modify it to suit our needs, so yuo may learn jiujitsu but you may at some point incorporate kicks into it because you have long strong legs|`|59wqRW9Aaa	I strongly suggest you take MMA considering it already incorporates    Kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu jitsu.|`|d9XXe2kLaa	Any chance of taking Jiu Jitsu and kickboxing?  Good combination and perhaps you would gain the most out of two separate classes rather than one 'MMA' class.    You are obviously tall and skinny so both should be fine - good reach and kickboxing will teach you how to develop powerful strikes.
AA11086243	entire cowboys team?    let's get that curse rolling!|`|ZyxqS5pZaa	Patrick Willis|`|kcZZaNi2aa	I think it should be Kurt Warner|`|QGBSOpt7aa	James Harrison    Defensive player of the year  100 yd INT for TD in superbowl (longest in SB history)    Although, I kind of hope he doesn't strictly because of the Madden curse!!!    Dont think it is real?? just look at this:  2000: Barry Sanders - With John Madden in the forefront of the cover image, Barry Sanders graced the background as he appeared to be stiff-armming some helpless Chicago Bear defender to the turf. Sanders had just come off a 1998 campaign in which he amassed almost 1800 total yards and moved into 2nd place all time on the career rushing yards list. But the best player in Detroit Lions history decided to call it quits before the '99 season kicked off, thus beginning the Madden Curse.     2001: Eddie George - It's a little far-fetched to call Eddie George a victim of the Madden Curse. After all, in 2000, he accumulated just under 2000 totall yards and scored 16 times. However, George did have a costly fumble in the AFC Divisional playoff game which cost Tennessee the game. Since that point, George had been injury prone and would average less than 3.4 yds/carry for the remainder of his career.     2002: Daunte Culpepper - In 2000, Culpepper threw for 33 TDs on the strength of 3937 passing yards. He ran for another 7 TDs. And he ultimately led the Vikings to the NFC Championship game that year. In 2001, the year he graced the cover of Madden football, he led the Vikings to only a mere 4-7 record before missing the remainder of the season with a knee injury. In those 11 games, he had thrown 13 picks and only 14 TDs.     2003: Marshall Faulk - Marshall Faulk's 2002 season was certainly hampered by a lingering ankle injury. For the first time in six years, he had failed to rush for 1000+ yards. For the first time in five years, he had failed to gain 2000+ total yards from scrimmage. He wouldn't achieve either of these milestones again.     2004: Michael Vick - Vick, who burst onto the scene as one of the most promising quarterback prospects ever, was the cover boy for Madden 2004. In his 2002 season, he flashed all the tools that had football people everywhere raving. In 2003, one day after Madden hit stores nationwide, Vick broke his leg in a preseason game. He would only play in five games the entire season while posting a less than stellar 69.0 QB rating. The Falcons went 2-10 without him that year. And, of course, Vick would go on to become a dog fighter, animal hater, and villain.     2005: Ray Lewis - Ray Ray's 2004 season was not completely decimated as in other examples. However, he did miss the final game of the season due to injury after playing in all 16 of the Ravens games in 2003. He also failed to record an interception in 2004, the only time that he has failed to do so in his career. In fact, he was only responsible for one turnover in 2004 where in 2003, he forced eight.     2006: Donovan McNabb - In 2004, McNabb finally led his Eagles to a SuperBowl appearance on the strength of  34 total TDs and a 104.7 QB rating. (For the record, he would lose to my Patriots.) Then, McNabb agreed to grace the cover of Madden 2006. That year (2005), he suffered a sports hernia in Week 1 and led the Eagles to a 4-5 record before reinjuring the hernia, opting for surgery, and missing the final seven games of the season.     2007: Shaun Alexander - Shaun Alexander was the NFL's MVP for the 2005 season. He put up ridiculous numbers: 1953 total yards and 28 total TDs. He also powered the Seahawks to their first ever SuperBowl appearance. In 2006, he fractured his foot and, consequently, missed six games. He struggled in the ten games he did play, carrying for over 100 yards only twice and scoring only seven times. He failed to top 1000 yards.     2008: Vince Young - Well, in Week 6 of this NFL season, Vince Young left the field with a left quad injury. Then had his major psychological break down|`|O2jH0yVFaa	abstract art|`|OFi3jBSHaa	T.O. dropping a pass.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Ben Roethlisberger|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	I hope he fitzgerald gets it so he gets the madden curse and gets injured or has a bad season. I'm a niner fan!|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Well, I'm relieved that nobody on the Jets deserves it this time. The curse is real.    I wouldn't wish that on Fitz, he seems like a pretty good guy.    (edit:) Steeler Fan 4 Life, you forgot the first and the latest:  1999 - Garrison Hearst broke his ankle, was out until 2001  2009 - Brett Favre tore his biceps, went from 8-3 to missing playoffs|`|exOOXAkBaa	Norv Turner, for obvious reasons.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	I think Troy Polamalu would be a good one, although Super Bowl winning teams never seem to get the cover.  In that case then another good player would be Andre Johnson.|`|IWPcs8kaaa	it should be Santonio Holmes,Hines Ward or Ben Roethlisberger|`|FmZyN6ORaa	LOL @ jeff...perfect example of a bandwagoner...    I agree, Fitzgerald has been incredible this postseason and was the main reason the cardinals made it to the Super Bowl, and he's a very classy person overall...I definitely think he deserves to be on the cover again|`|pHhICD6Baa	Matt Ryan -- He completely turned a franchise around. . .    Yes, he had some help with Michael Turner, but still he made a team and a city forget an unforgettable star.|`|g5wninniaa	i think big ben does...he has 2 rings now.      and anyone but brett favre...i was so mad that they put him on there...esp in a packers uniform!|`|gBfPkdroaa	ummm no id like James Harrison to be on it, that way he be Cursed with the madden cursee!!|`|iGYGJfgsaa	Thats easy,Troy Palumalu|`|tNerdFYsaa	I think it should be Fitz, but im a little hesitant because he was on the NCAA cover, so im thinking Adrian Peterson|`|1gPJO37qaa	Larry fitz has already been on the NCAA Cover|`|q34vCB3Qaa	fitzgerald is the same guy who made that 100 yd td right? is yea then i agree with you.|`|DTdCvDataa	definitely the guy on the steelers getting the catch at the last Play in the TD or the fat guy getting the interception or definitely the QB for the eagles im from Philadelphia Love the eagles or steve smith|`|wJd0gNymaa	That'd be a cool cover he'd be one of my top choices too. As long as I'm here I'll throw another name out there and say Patrick Willis from the 49ers great LB the next Ray Lewis|`|U7NTEaygaa	That's exactly what I was thinking. He is definitely the best WR in the NFL right now. ( I'm a Packers fan).|`|kGur839Daa	id say fitz, matt ryan, or joe flacco|`|7GHkeHZpaa	I agree that it should be a WR and it probably will/should be Fitz thanks to their superbowl run... but I don't think he's the best WR in the NFL, I give that to Andre Johnson.|`|7tfs6qAzaa	GO PACKERS and anyone on the madden cover sucks the next year EX. Vince Young, Ray Lewis has been goin downhill since 05', Shaun Alexander sucked in 2008, Brett Farve(awesomeess)sucked this year.  How has Ladanian Tomlinson not got on the cover yet?|`|YCwmCDkUaa	wow jeff...are you an idiot bandwagoner or what??    "the guy" who had the 100 yd td was Harrison...man, you are stupid...get off of the wagon...    I don't care who's on the Madden cover as long as it's NOT a Steeler...I don't want any curses on our team...so go ahead and give it to Fitzgerald...better yet, Flacco...|`|fee5b1d1de4e8ba547c820b12c85a4d7aa	New to this answer questions thing however this one intrigued me as an avid madden fan...    I'm a little surprised Adrian Peterson was not in the conversation.  Seeing as he was the leading rusher in the league and practically carried the Vikings to the playoffs.  He's the perfect young running back that would be perfect for marketing.  I would turn it down if I were him........torn acl......broken leg.......concussion....somethings bound to happen.....|`|TAYErNRkaa	Alfred E Newman arm n arm with Matt Millen|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	Adrian all day Peterson
aX8nee8gaa	As a better player, you are more likely to have the opposite swing flaws from the over the top high handicappers. The hook, particularly toe hook, usually comes because the hands and arms lift the club up and away from the body in the takeaway and then the legs drive/slide too much through the ball. When the legs go too hard and slide too far forward, the upper body hangs back and stops rotating, the club gets extremely inside/out and the hands flip the club over at impact. You probably feel weight still on your back foot through the ball and may feel some tension in your right lower back as your upper body leans backward through impact. You may have trouble staying in balance because your torso has not rotated fully to the target. The cure is to quiet your leg action and try to stay in your spine angle through the ball. When I get hooking it a little, I always go back to feeling like my hands and arms do absolutely nothing but hold on to the club. That way I can turn away from the ball on plane and really turn back aggressively though the ball. Hands and arms just go along for the ride. When I want to hit it further I simply make a little fuller turn and then rotate faster through.   Very common problem for better players, hope this helps.|`|uJPPxyewaa	Sounds like your hands/wrists are to involved. I used to have this problem all the time.     The best way I can fix it on the course is to grip the shaft way down on the club, like maybe 10 inches from the driver head. Then take practice swings and make sure the head stays square with your hands. It works because you dont hook your wedges and they are shorter, so if you just take a few swings with your hands almost at the club head, and then move gradually back up on the practice swings, it will usually give you a feel for your hands. This has saved my so many times during tournaments when i know i cant hit it left.     Seriously, Try it.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	I have found that in most cases a hook or pull hook comes from trying to swing too hard.  You may in fact be trying to slow down....but your body may be doing something entirely different.....When golfers usually try to slow down they mean they are slowing their arms down. To get a bit philosophical here....The swing must flow like water...every thing moving in synchronicity.  You asked for a drill........The one I use most is to take a 5 Iron....Stand with your feet together....Take 1/2 swings and hit balls......Watch your ball flight.  Don't overswing....Stay in balance.  Gradually work out to a full stance and full swing......It works for me....maybe it will work for you........It just seems to get me back in sync.   The only other thing I would offer if this does not cure your problem is a visit to a teaching pro....He may see something entirely different that will fix you right and proper|`|sBrummATaa	in your grip turn your left hand to the left around the shaft(assuming your right handed), and also open your stance like stand normal and move your front foot back like your moving it behind you|`|Wa7wktLkaa	o9mfog ihein67PDk **** !!!!!! **** you yahoo i just wrote a ******* 20 minute answer and ******** preview answer i closed the window fiouhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas    ok im pissed off so it wont be as good as the original answer but im sorry    to cure a hook:     in order of things you should do first    grip it lighter    aim straight    try and hit a fade.    good luck and good golfing mate.|`|wYGeg0QRaa	As dumb as this may sound GC has come up with a gem of an answer for you. If you have just started this hooking problem and used to bomb it the sure fire cure is to simply try to fade it..end of problem.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	did your grip change?  it could be possible that your grip is too strong.  the V's that your thumbs and hands make are supposed to point at your right shoulder (for a righty).  It's possible that they're pointing past your shoulder, without you knowing it, and that led to more compensations.    the finishing out of balance is from trying to kill the ball, because you're looking for lost distance.    weaken your grip and swing under control.  try swinging at 50-60% at first, so you can get some feel (and your finish) back in your senses.  after you get comfortable, work up to 70%, then 80%.      if it WAS the grip and you get it back to where you had it, everything else should fall back into place- even the distance.|`|sKTaniriaa	Wow, you really hit the jackpot here. A lot of solid info. Here's one more thing to mull over, when I feel like I am out of sync I will make practice swings with just my left hand on the club. I could go on about the benefits, but anyone who has used this tip knows full well. It has been an absolute cure-all for me to this point. Good luck.|`|MPm4DJkEaa	Cool question!  Firstly...stop trying so hard! sounds vacuous I know, but really - just relax.  Best way of relaxing with your swing, is firstly to practice only with an 8 or a 9 iron. Check your feet are pointing where you want the ball to go,   Tee the ball up, address it, then take your right hand off the club and practice the next 20 shots with only a half swing with your left hand, counting to 3 on the back swing, holding for  a second, then keep you eye on the ball so much so that you are inspecting the turf it was sitting on long after it has flown away....   give it a go!  Gabi - a long time golfer!|`|JSGLKnA4aa	check your feet. line up straight to target. relax. keep eyes on ball. try turning your hand over in grip alil to keep it from collapsing. nobody can really help! you have to practise to find what works for you. good luck.|`|5DjrC6ORaa	Try this:    Grip the driver with a little bit more pressure with your last three fingers on your left hand.    Your middle, ring and pinky.      Hope this works, sometimes the easiest answers are the best- don't over think it- it is only a game.

Xl7N65Xbaa	Well you got to look at wrestlemania first before you decide this. I believe either edge will retain the belt. Than at Wrestlemania Edge will either face Big Show or Triple H. I believe Kane will face Undertaker at Wrestlemania 25 because Taker comes to Raw and I believe Kane will get involved. Now, I think Cena will win the title or Jericho and whoever wins that will prolly face each other at wrestlemania.

So you can cross Jacksonville off the list.    If either of these teams were to relocate, then Winnipeg, Hartfort, a second Toronto (and area) team would all be possibilities. But relocation is not going to happen any time soon.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	jacksonville will not get a team anytime soon|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Jacksonville?  Have you been hanging out with Michael Phelps?

But relocation will never happen as long as Gary Bettman is at the healm.

Ducks, Thrashers, Panthers, Predators, Coyotes, Lightning, Hurricanes, and Blue Jackets have to go!|`|786QN5Aeaa	I hate to say it, but from what I have heard lately, the league may be just losing a couple teams soon, no relocation.

And just for fact--- Winnipeg had a team and had attendance issues and money problems much WORSE than either Nashville or Phoenix..  Yet many feel they deserve a team back from either NSH or PHX (or pretty much anywhere in the southern U.S.) with the reasons being the Preds and Yotes "dont have enough fans " and  "are losing money"???    LMAO-- talk about hippocracy...|`|5UIsGjxCaa	Yes Nashville and Phoenix are most likely to relocate according to Forbes Magazine. Except that Phoenix has a lease that they can't get out of and Nashville might be making money thanks to revenue sharing. So the owners of either team will not be moving them nor will they be selling them to people who will or can move them.   No Jacksonville and Winterpeg are not the spots for relocating NHL franchises to. (Poor grammar but good logic).   Jacksonville because there is already difficulty in attracting crowds to Atlanta and Tampa Bay. so another team in that area would be just as bad.   Winterpeg because the new arena doesn't have the facilities to be an NHL arena. It is an excellent AHL arena but there is a shortage of corporate boxes and come to think of it a shortage of corporate clients to buy those boxes and so is a poor choice for expansion or relocation.|`|xmZWsKEhaa	Relocate the Ducks?    That's insane. They have a great fan base. Had 70+ sellouts in a row.     Clearly you know little about the hockey scene in Orange County. The Ducks pull fans from LA, OC and San Diego. That's prime real estate.
D1beU6MPaa	The first thing you need to know is as much about horses as possible. Know breeding aspects, training, how horses run under what conditions.  Get to know the industry, trainers, hot walkers, grooms, etc. Get to know other jockeys an get tips on how they got their start.  Watch your weight. In most countries a jockey can never weigh more than 115 pounds. You have to maintain weight in order to meet weight requirements..  Most jockeys start by working in other aspects of the training process. They hot walk horses (cool them down after training) grooming and participate in exercising duties long before they actually become a jockey. They get to know the profession and decide if this is the career they want to have.  You need to go to Jockey School such as Frank Garza Jockey School in Southern California. There are also jockey schools like Chris McCarons in Kentucky..  You start by running schooling races. These are races that help you get familiarized with racing and track facilities, and prepare you to become a jockey. Often this is required before you can obtain a jockey license.  You must have a license in order to be a jockey. Most racetracks provide applications and the license is good for any racetrack within a given area. Recommendation from a trainer to jockey school is a huge plus. Good luck.   Source(s):      Excuse me whoever you are since you are hiding your name. I know very well what I am talkling about. I have been involved with this sport my entire life, and I am no young punk. If I answer a question here, you better know you are hearing the truth. So if you don't like my answers, ignore me, and believe me, I will do the same with you. And BTW if you think I believe you are a jockey you have holes in your head. You most certainly do need to go to school to be a jockey, and you have to be licensed. BTW where did you get your jockey license? Oh I know, from the dumb, dumb school  Horse owner and breeder  Avid horse racing enthusiast    Add: Thank you sister of cuddles, I appreciate your kind words.                          Add: I just got off the phone with the executive directer of the Jockey School in California. He told me that because of insurance liabilities, jockey's do need to go to school in order to be considered to ride for most any owner or organization. If you can get you foot in the door without going to school, you can be a jockey, but most owners do not want anyone riding their horses that have not attended jockey school.   They teach you from the ground up. So it is a tongue in cheek sort of situation.    And please do not email me or be rude to me. ANd quit calling me names. BTW you have been reported|`|V028jDjWaa	Don't worry about finding a jockey "school". They may teach you to ride but you learn that and much more through experience on the track.  There is no better education than experience. I worked at the track and don't know of any jocks that went to a formal jockey school. They just don't exist in a lot of places.  You could go to this school, then go to that track and expect to get a job as a jockey, but it isn't going to work, sorry, because you have to prove yourself as a horseman/woman to the people at the track where you want to ride.  So basically you have to work your way up anyway and if people trust you and like you, you get a chance to exercise horses and ride. If you can go to a jockey school, by all means go ahead but don't sweat not going because you don't need to.

wnyuH0aTaa	Try it yourself first out of your bedroom window.    All you need is a couple of hundred big elastic bands. Tie 'em together and tie one end around your ankle and one end around the leg of your bed. Then fling yourself out of the window and boing about a bit.    You will be able to tell if your elastic band rope is too long if you smash your face to a pulp on your patio. If this happens shorten it a bit and try again after you have dabbed your horrific wounds with iodine.    For safety you should wear a saucepan on your head, oven mitts and a good pair of stout hob nailed boots.    Happy bouncing, mon ami.

Without him Liverpool appeared lost night night and I suspect that if he had not been injured they would have remained a great threat throughout the game. The loss of Lucas was fortunate for us and thereafter we were able to play with confidence and style. It was completely different from the preceding period when we seemed unable to string two passes together. Why can't Everton play with style and confidence all the time. I hope that Jo will bring striking rhythm to our team and that he and Cahill will prove to be a fruitful partnership.

oMSTg5rQaa	If your an efficient player having a high usage rating is a good thing, if your not, well it's bad.    Usage simply means how many possessions you have the ball and what you do with it.     That isn't the official meaning, but that about sums it up. "PER" or Player Efficiency Rating is the best stat to tell if a player has a good or bad usage rating. It's basically subtracting the bad stats (missed FG's/FT's and turnovers) from the good ones (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks).    For instance, 2 players with very high usage ratings with very different results are Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson.    On a typical night both players would perform like this:    Michael Jordan  12-23FG  7-8FT  1-3FG3  32 points  6 rebounds  6 assists  3 steals  3 turnovers  PER = 32.0    Allen Iverson  9-22  8-10  2-6  28 points  4 rebounds  7assists  3 steals  4 turnovers  PER=23.0    Hope that helped a bit.

6en8QlaUaa	Wow a female that loves shooting.   Where have you been all of my life?    Seriously, I think if at all possible, I would make it a group event.   If you have a Father or Brother or even a friend that enjoys shooting,  take them along so your boyfriend doesn't feel like he's only getting instruction from a "girl"    I think if you can get him past this hurdle then you will probably have a shooting partner for life.    Good luck.|`|2VTdswBqaa	If you can not shoot outdoors, then before going to an indoor range show him everything he needs to know. That way it can seem like he is doing it on his own with you watching closely. You can cough when he starts to do something wrong to cue him such as putting mag in backwards. Obviously, call a ceasefire if something dangerous is going to occur. Practice at home with an EMPTY gun till he knows his stuff.|`|wdR8pPH3aa	Shooting is a skill just like swiming or bicycle riding or cooking etc.    Teach him your skill and maybe he can teach you one of his.    Who would he rather learn from his G/F or some souped up mall ninja with a buzz cut?    Tell him it's good company.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Get him out there.....    Trust me --- After 3 shots he will think he's the expert....|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Most of my experience in this is with pistols, so I'll use that context, but rifles are much the same.    So, there have been a number of comments here complimenting you (which I echo) as well as variants of telling him to get over it in one form or another. As a guy who was once a HORRIBLE pistol shooter I understand where he is at.    I don't know if it will do it for him, but I'll tell you what did it for me.    Bullseyes.    Walk the line at any range you go to with the weekend shooters. There is an unimaginable lineup of people that can barely stay on paper at 15 feet. People shooting at full size profile targets like "Mullet Man" at 15 to 20 feet that are half on and half off.     Even beyond that there are piles of people filling the lanes who are barely on a T2 bullseye target at 20 - 25 feet, shooting groups that spread all over it.     Lots of those people are guys who think of themselves as serious pistoleros and have pretty good size egos. So, how do you think they feel when right next to them someone just starts ripping the center out of a T2 at the same distance? In fact, when, with a little practice, you fold the target into 3rds so just the black is showing and still rip the center out or cut them in half?    That's what shooting ego is about. If you can hook your S.O. on being able to shoot like that (and with some practice even on the first day you can get a long way there) it won't even matter who taught him. In fact, if he gets to there, he may get to the point where it becomes a great story.     I can flat out tell you that after running through different rapid fire drills, reloading drills, split distance drills and the like, the thing I LOVE to do is pull the paper off the target carrier completely and make the shotgun wadding at the end of the range dance. It only takes a couple of good hits on that stuff before people are wandering around the back of your lane to see how the heck you are hitting a little piece of white in the gray background at the end of the range while they are struggling to get a decent group at 21 feet with their superpistol of choice. (it's even better if when they ask you to try their gun you walk over and can outshoot them with it cold, but that's a bit more advanced.)    Have fun,    Thinkingblade|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Tell him "If I learned, then you should have no problems."    Knowing how to defend yourself is a valuable skill. He can spend a few hours a month at the range and learn to shoot or he can spend years learning kung fu.|`|SLy9xFwkaa	if it was me, teach him everything he would need to know at the range so he would atleast look decent there that would proably help him a little, and also if he doesn't want to go maybe find somewhere  else where you know there wont be anyone else. and if nothing else be like hey quit being a weeney everyone is new to firearms at one point or another.    also if you want make it a game, say get a bullseye at the range and ill do something for you when we get home, i.e. put on some sexy clothes and such..... if i didn't wanna do soemthing and my wife told me that i'ed be on it.|`|AA11694178	Given that your boyfriend has these problems with taking lessons from a woman, see if you can find a male friend, who is knowlegible about guns, to teach him how to shoot.    Take a long good look at this guy before you make any serious commintment to him.  A REAL man is secure enough in his sexuality that he can take any kind of lessons from a woman without feeling his manhood being threatened.    What will be the next thing he will balk at?  Cooking a meal when you are sick?  Helping you with some of the housework?  Bathing or changing the baby?  Will he define all of these things as "woman's work" and feel threatened by doing them.  Just a word to the wise.  Think about it.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	i know plenty of guys who have been taught how to shoot a gun by a girl/woman.     like someone said, once he shoots a few times, he'll think he's a expert- but try not to let him get "the big head" because as soon as he does, he'll over think it.     think of it this way with you teaching him and not another guy- your probably a great shot, and by him learning from you, he'll have a advantage over other guys because he'll probably get the shooting "bug"  lol  once he gets shooting, and starts to enjoy it, i think that he'll over look that part about it. also, he's ego won't get damaged at all, it will probably boost it because he's being taught by a girl and the rest of the guys out there may get jealous lol- ya never know with guys lol     tell him just to try it and if he doesn't like it, then you won't make him go to a shooting range.. but if yall live in a rural town or know anyone with a good bit of land outside the city limits, then you could take him there that way you'll kill 'two birds with one stone'     a afterthought- tell him that most guys don't get the privilege to have a girl teach them how to shoot a gun, so he's lucky (:     good luck and hope yall will have fun|`|TtMKPBR3aa	ever since dick cheney lots of guys shy away from going shooting with their friends|`|L9MDzufnaa	Do the, "Wanna dance?" trick with the gun.  He'll get over his fear of ridicule, if not weapons.|`|AA11570394	I have a daughter who married a fellow from the Deep South who thought he was the man about every darn thing and yes he was sexist. Funny thing is my daughter knew far more than he did about guns. He was intimidated so much he asked me what I thought. I told him if he was in the military and his basic training instructor was a woman he would have to listen to her. This some how sunk into his brain (hey for him thats shocking!).  Anyway gender should never be an issue with a student or instructor.  There are female law enforcement instructors, female martial arts instructors and about every skill you can think of. So if he cant handle it hes being childish and sexist.    I would advise you to teach him alone, away from other males at first so he wont be worried about what they might think (which is silly to me).    In my life there have been many women that taught me many things about guns, wilderness survival, carpentry and nature. The only problem I had as a young man was paying too much attention to her figure than what she was saying lol.    I would suggest you dress and act the part of an instructor. In other words dont get all dolled up wearing tight jeans and such. If you look at how female competition shooters dress you will see what I mean. Most of them dress to shoot not to turn heads. This way you wont have the men checking you out so much and it will make him feel more relaxed.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Just tell him that the people will not think any less of him.  They will actually be proud of him for learning to shoot.    Then ask him "Does it really matter what other people think?"    As a backup plan, call the range and line up a 30 minute lesson with an "instructor".    The instructor may just be a friend of the RSO who is coming to the range at the same time.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Honestly?  I'd take him out on some private land somewhere first.  Shoot into a hill or pond dam.  That way, he won't be nervous, as there won't be anyone to make fun of him.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Nothing sexier than a girl who likes guns, what a lucky guy.      So try to show him a little before you go out and maybe try a range with less people so it's just the two of you.     Don't show him up, on gun knowledge (at least in front of other people).    Also try not to get into a competition because you will probably out shoot him. That can come later.    These are basically what I do when taking a girl, my kids or someone unfamiliar with shooting.....out for the first few times.    Good luck|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Tell him to grow a set and go.|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	If he really feels that bad, you could find a place out in the country to shoot.      Trust me, he can't be nearly as bad a shot as a lot of the people at a public gun range.      It probably be best if he would just swallow his pride.  Just remind him that guns can be fun, and the learning curve is very short.|`|nqknrW7taa	Not really anything I can think of to say to him but you could try to pull rank and tell him if he does not go then you are gonna tell every one how much of a wuss he is .. or tell him not to expect to get any more of you know what for a while if he backs out       Seriously simply tell him that he has to learn somewhere, why not with the woman he love (ifs its at that point). I would say give him some pointers before you leave the house.     Good Luck.

45uTMd26aa	Because he realises that the fans are really not into the division. The Light-Heavyweight division never had alot of interest back before the WCW/ECW Invasion, and even after the name and title switch, the division was still mostly ignored by the fans. WWE's Crusierweight divison just never amounted to the glory and showmanship of a good WCW Cruiserweight match. He dropped it for a reason.     Even though there are plenty of wrestlers deserving of a little prestige, overall the WWE version doesnt account for much.|`|2UkdpGHFaa	Helms for Cruiserweight champ!    And I hope the title comes back like it should. I'd rather have that title on SmackDown! than the useless Divas Championship.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	kendrick  helms  and chavo deserve better than cruiserweight|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, I agree with you.

tdsWUGQkaa	These are rumors, it was written in a spanish guy's blog which is simply his opinion, he picks out the news he likes and exaggerates it.    Cesc Fabregas won't leave Arsenal, and definitely not this summer, unless Arsenal are in the 2nd division. David Villa won't leave Valencia either, the verbal confirmation talk is non-sense, if that is really true why would he (his choice) to extend his contract with Valencia, despite all the economic difficulties, Barcelona are interested but that does not mean that Villa has agreed, Eto'o said he wants to end his career there, in the last 2 years of his career, not now.  Yoann Gourcuff is a midfielder not a striker, so he might be a replacement for another midfielder, and I do not see what's wrong with Henry, he's scoring goals in Barcelona so why get rid of him?    EDIT: Fabregas will eventually leave Arsenal and we all know that, but he remains ambitious at Arsenal, he has faith in the coach and team that basically made his name, and he doesn't want to put them down, i will give it 3 seasons for him, or at least until Arsene Wenger leaves.  As for Villa: http://www.goal.com/en/news/1706/barcelo...  Plus, Villa stated that if he ever left Valencia he would return to the club he supported as a child, Sporting Gijon, either that or to the English Premier League, he doesn't want fans to hate him by switching to a bigger team in the same league.  I'm not sure if you follow the news but Valencia's players were told they are going to be paid in the coming days, sometime before the 15th of this month, I do not think it's a problem since they already earn alot of money so a few days without being paid isn't an issue.|`|7fd2a2ec5e10e819c1ed10f2c696ec4eaa	i heard that barca is looking to sign gourcuff and villa to replace henry, and their main target is villa.  but cesc, i'm not sure he'll move to barca this summer. in several years from now, maybe, because cesc himself always says he would like to retire at barca.    for villa, valencia wants around 80-100 million euros, while barca only wants to prepare 30m for now. they will also have to fight man city's offer, 70m  so all those transfer issues are still far from being confirmed, maybe we'll see who's serious about who around the summer|`|oDh1dF3Qaa	I'd love to see Cesc and David at Barca, which IMO still feels empty since Ronaldinho left.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Sowee Speedy but.....you ain't getting any of them! Maybe that Gourcuff dude but I know Cesc is staying at Aresnal and Villa said he's staying at Valencia for the rest of the season...maybe in the summer? :)    Oh yeah btw Silva and Villa are a little package so Emery or whoever the president of Valencia is will only sell them together :)      lol. Yehh I don't want him leaving Spain :)|`|8yMkjeDdaa	Cesc?  hahahahahhahahahaha no effing way!  his a gunner|`|TxVAXBpTaa	No... Barca will not trade anyone or get anyone..|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Villa himself asked his manager to contact Barca and to start negotiations, Cesc will not come next season, he will be at Barca again without a doubt but not so soon and they're after Ribery and Gourcuff, I personally would LOVE to see Ribery at Camp Nou but Villa+Ribery+LB = more than 100M.... no way that Barca will spend so much money in one season on thee players.... and I don't know why are they after Villa, I would rather take Silva or some other left winger because we already have Eto'o and Bojan will be old enough to get more playing time next season!!!!|`|3zNIeEl2aa	I don't buy this story with Gourkuff and they dont so need Cesc, and he's good where he is. And they already have Yaya Xavi Iniesta + Keita and Busquet in the middle.  Barca should do everything to get Ribery or Silva...That what they really need. And to buy Villa in case Eto'o will leave. Otherwise, it could make some problems.
dtGInk4Faa	final 0ne!|`|FUoKu13Daa	no but I also think the game was to close to be chanting for another team player, If the game was basically a blow out then maybe you would of had some chants.|`|WUzgGtAAaa	no.|`|5ANmjtLOaa	No...we were cheering for the knicks.
wphUIz0naa	Can you effectively teach the class? The reason we don't pay for lessons is because we are a free contribution to the master just by showing up. We take some of the work load by teaching. That's why we do not pay.  Offer what you can, but discretion is up to the headmaster.|`|bCp9wZgSaa	F*ck Tae Kwon Do it's all abou tthe Mixe Martial Arts now|`|3WrASeMTaa	Oh there are so many problems with your question/idea...    Basically, the reason "black belts" don't pay at a club is usually related to things other than the fact that they have a black cloth around their waist. What those reasons are will differ between various clubs but it is most likely linked to benefit to the dojo (teaching, helping, office work, etc).     At our dojo all of the black belts pay. If there is a personal matter between them and the grandmaster (such as job loss, family problems, etc), well that is between them. The rule is every pays their way or carries their weight.     So... would you carry your weight? As some one that has been out of it for a while (according to your initial comments)? I would say...no way. As we say here in Japan... "Damate Keiko." Roughly translates as "Shut up and train" ;)|`|C0sT0PPyaa	i know many black belt and they don't pay and i'm not a black belt and some schools i don't pay at.  but sometimes I do pay and sometimes my instructor pays from his pocket even though he shouldn't.  your question isn't correct.  you should go train and offer the instructor dues sincerely, as its an honor.  when you establish yourself again and contribute like you used to and should then you instructor will tell you to keep your money.  or you will be reimbursed in other ways.      edit: as a black belt you should be able to answer this yourself!!!    edit: do you realize how many students come to class either without remembering dues or who believe they shouldn't have to pay.  its your instructors livelyhood whereas your just flowing through the doors like the wind.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	this is more up the your school. and there policy's  some places i go to i dont pay other i do. but in the cases where i dont pay i usually buy the instructor lunch or dinner, something.  remember there spend there time to train you. you should give them back something. especially if this is there only source of income.   some instructors dont care as much, but out of respect you should give them something in return|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Unless you're one how the higher ranking belts there and are teaching, but not learning then you'll have to pay. It's going to depend mainly on what school it is. You should talk with the lead instructor about teaching in exchange for training.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Since you are only a beginner black belt and have been out you should have to pay for training regardless. If you were ranked around 3rd degree and were a competent teacher then you could exchange your teaching ability for tuition but a good instructor should not let you get free training at a lower rank since you are still a begining student (even at black belt level).    I am an 8th degree black belt and I still pay for training...be it seminars, attending schools with other instructors or what not I am happy to do so because I truly want to learn. No one ever earns the right to be cheap and try and get something for nothing. If the training is good then I will pay. If I want to honor my school and help it out I will pay....NO MATTER what my rank is. I even travel and train and if I visit a school I will give them money whether they want it or not for teaching me or even to just let me workout with them.    You also need to realize that all students, regardless of rank, should pay something to help their dojo succeed. Schools pay rent, utlities and need insurance...if you think you should not have to pay to help out your school then you don't belong in a traditional or even good school.     That being said I do not feel that qualified black belts who are dedicated should have to pay the same tuition rates as lower ranked students IF they are helping out their dojo by assistig in classes. Just because the have a black cloth around their waste does not mean they are any good at teaching...not even close. Our black belts pay a reduced fee but they get a black belt only class. The only time a black belt does not pay is when they are given the license to own / manage their own school...yes you must be licensed in the real martial arts world. From my experience most of the time if its free then it is not worth it in terms of quality instruction and I have been training for 31 years.|`|HuwEDF0Qaa	I still pay for every ounce of training I receive.  I also make my Black Belts pay for their training, either by working for me or in tuition.    There's no such thing as a free lunch.|`|AA11264943	yes, still paying, and teaching and helping out.  But there may come a time when that stops, hopefully in June.  :o)    We have had guys come in with your situation, yes they have to pay.  But most of them didn't remember their forms and stuff.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	If you are looking to get a higher rank, like more degrees, or are just using the studio/training facilities to practice and get professional instruction you will have to pay. If you are helping instruct and train you most likely wont have to pay.|`|6nGII584aa	i would go be willign to pay but if you havnt done it for a long time even if you have been practicing everything they might ask you to retest for it in a class or something to make sure you realy  are that level.
RGxMkT0zaa	I feel sorry for you all. SL is just not even fielding well.   A toss has some but not much affect. U mean to say Dhoni won the toss, so he will win. But what about getting him out.  Toss is more effective in Test Matches.    Had Dhoni lost the toss today, they'd still win. It is a great team. Look how they hit Sixes.|`|mZ2Uluioaa	if you see the history of ODI cricket , almost 50% of the matches have been won with lost toss, you generalisation is not proven in ODI cricket especially on these flat wickets of SL and appears to be another excuse of incompetency of your team. you have batted first , then also you lost, you have bowled first then also you lost , what do you want indian team to do? lose the toss and then defeat you, then you will come to luck, the next readymade excuse ~|`|7oHt9fTkaa	it depends on the pitch.In Premadasa ground, it always helped to first batting team.and if you chose to bowl first it will be your disaster.  hope at least their will be a turn of luck of Dhoni to see actually toss cause winning or losing.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Its not like that. Toss makes you to carry out your plan as it is if you win it. Or else you have to change your strategy according to the Opposition Captain's Decision. Thats it. Not that who wins the toss wins the match.Excuses never help you to go further. With legends like Jayasurya and Murali under the belts with likes of super players like Kumara Sangakkara,Dilshan and Mahela SL should not rely merely on a Toss|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	It is not always that the team wins the toss and win the match.  There have been many occasions where the team which won the toss has lost the matches.    While there are certain advantages of winning the match, such as taking the decision whether to bat or bowl first depending upon the conditions, the ultimate result of the match purely depend upon the performance of the team.  If the team wins the toss bats first, they have to post a challenging total to defeat the opposition.  However, if they are out for a modest total the advantage of winning the toss and batting first is lost and the team will end up on the loosing side as thje opposition can plan their innings depending upon the total to be chased..|`|cPVeOThsaa	coz it's a lame game..only retards play cricket!!|`|oLwmpSPQaa	The toss certainly makes a difference. When weather conditions are not good it can be very affective. Losing the toss in the last world cup final was a classic example.     Losing a match after winning the toss is rare these days. India have been extremely lucky with their recent wins.     If they played on neutral grounds it will certainly highlight the most efficient team.-|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	Not all the time!    The team that wins the toss will choose bat or field according to the conditions of pitch, weather etc. so they have a better chance of winning.
7oHt9fTkaa	i'm always hoping him to do that.  but can't predict  like the toss  toss wins match wins  toss lose match lose|`|4wPbaVzzaa	He will get out trying make the ball play over mid wicket and get bowled|`|z4UGwO7taa	I bet he'll try his best..!! n Guys..!! Dilshan is named captain for the 20Twenty match..|`|oLwmpSPQaa	He will need to lift and score like he did in his previous innings excluding the Indians.     Jayasuriya needs to chip in too.    The failure of Jayawardene is making and determining the result of the game.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Actually its not Dilshan's way of playing too attacking. Jayasurya have to attack the bowler and Dilshan have to rotate the strike. Once he stands he can go for for shots. He is a very good emerging talented player for SL. They should not pressurize him for too much. Let him carry out his own style of playing. happy he is named Captain of T20 Side.

nrePUyciaa	to a point yes bigger muscles=faster running but there are other factors that will make you run faster as well. As you probably have noticed good sprinters do have big very well toned muscles and distance runners have smaller toned muscles but just because a muscle is not huge does not mean that there is no muscle. For example when you TRAIN to sprint your muscles will get naturally bigger because of what you are asking your body to do. Sprinting requires oxygen to get to your muscles faster there fore you would train your fast twitch muscles (fast twitch muscles release oxygen into the muscles faster than slow twitch) a fast twitch muscle will naturally get bigger than a slow twitch muscle. a slow twitch muscle releases oxygen over a longer period of time which what a distance runner has. These muscles are longer leaner muscle which is why they are not as big as a sprinters muscles. But just going to a gym making your muscles huge won't make you a faster runner. That kind of muscle will just make you slower. A body builders muscles are trained to move fast. so to sum this all up the best way to get faster is to do sprint work. Your body will naturally build the muscles it needs.|`|AA10241450	If you equation was true most body builders would be running in the Olympics.  I think a better equation would be training = faster running.      The training can be a combination of resistance training, intervals, aerobic miles, running drills, hill spints, stretching, etc.  Strength does help however it diminishes over time - you wouldn't want to hypertrophy for instance carry 500 lbs of muscle for a race.|`|ocHNtbQZaa	To improve running speed it is best to get stronger without getting much bigger. Getting bigger adds body weight which can slow you down. To get stronger without getting bigger do fewer reps with heavy weight.|`|zjs9t7vfaa	nope.....    muscular whole body = fast running|`|kfyDRQFSaa	I would say Flexibility is the most important.  If you have supple limber muscles it increases your range of motion, therefore increasing the range at which you can excert power.  Leg speed is also important.    Supple Muscle + leg speed = Pace!|`|7FktMvdkaa	no. stretch. look up fast and slow twitch muscle fibers it'll explain everything.

rseD4OG2aa	I think the big reason is because WWE, and really professional wrestling in general, is all about storytelling. And the best type of story is a comeback one.   Also, pro wrestling isn't like any other type of business. In most places, when you retire, you're retired. Or when you're fired or released, you stay fired or released. I've always found it kind of interesting that that rational doesn't really apply to professional wrestling.   After storytelling, unpredictability is huge. The crowds love to see unexpected things, and big returns from wrestlers they never though they'd see again is a good way for any wrestling company to operate. I think that Vince's motivation for bringing guys back that he's previously parted ways with is money. If a former star returns a few years after he's left WWE, the fans will go crazy for him and maybe boost ratings or buy a few more PPV's, at least in the short run. Look at Hulk Hogan. People go crazy whenever he comes back after a long absence, but if he stays to long they turn on him, every time. But he keeps coming back in short stints, and people spend more money in those short spurts.|`|tl1HTJRwaa	Vince Mcmahon is only looking to make money if he really cared for his employees welfare he'd get them help for drug addiction as well as many of them using steroids.  Look at Benoit Vince quickly distanced himself from that situation because it would give his company a bad name.......|`|QQyWUDI8aa	WELL BECAUSE HE IS A NICE PERSON NOT ON TV LIKE Ultimate Warrior, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Shawn Michael's, Curt Hennig (RIP), Tony Atlas ARE LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE WWE HOW IT IS TO DAY GOOD TO WATCH ON TV.

mTXHW3lzaa	The 800m is still classified as a dash. Remember, you never HAVE to win a race. You shouldnt race other people, race yourself, race your best time. If keep improving, winning will come. I find the best way to win the 800m is to muscle out the competition, in the younger age classes everyone is a kicker, take it out hard and steal their legs and get out of trouble early. For training, 5x400m repeats at your 800m goal pace, with 3 minutes break is good. Strong 20min runs to give you the extra strength on the other guys, and long slow runs just for the aerobic. Good luck!|`|iktuXTQTaa	You should tag along and start breaking at 500 yards and out muscle them!|`|eDCyle05aa	First off you need to relax. Swimming will help a little bit but not much, the best thing you can do to train is a ladder workout (400, 600, 800, 1000, 800, 600, 400) do that with a 2-3 minute break between runs.. That is the workout i do in college. After that you can do some 200m sprints to build more speed. Running hills or steps would also be great if there is a hill near your house about 50 meters long do between 5-8 sprints up it. Good Luck.|`|AA10781209	run faster|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	most of the time, it's practice.|`|AA11974702	PRAY FIRST. look straight to the finish line, dont get intimidated by those ahead or behind you..goodluck.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	First, just take a deep breath.  Don't think about the race, just concentrate on what's going on right now.  I always get nervous before races, too, and that always seems to help.    Anyways, are you running in spikes?  If you have them you definitely should wear them.    See the 800 is a mid-distance run, so you still have time to pace yourself the smallest bit, especially at your level.  I'd say go a few notches below all out on your first lap, but still try to stay on the tail of some of the front runners.  On the second lap, don't hold back.  Try to pass as many people as possible.  Start your kick about halfway in on your second lap.    Don't be so concentrated on winning.  Just focus on trying to do your best, because otherwise you'll stress yourself out and be crushed if you don't win.  Good luck!
vWyRnBMdaa	Sparring  Get comfortable with a fighting  Environment so it's not a whole new world  Once your mind thinks of fighting  As routine it will no longer make it such a blur  And u can fight with both ur body and brain|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Training.  Remember that he can still hurt you, and if you charge in you will get hurt (this is what you learn in training).  Balance, timing, power, speed, distance, angle.   Shift your gaze continually from his chest to his eyes and back again. Staring at his chest gives you the ability to attack his whole body and notice the moves he is making. His eyes dilate just the smallest bit when he is about to try something really big (small movements, but his legs and core alter too). Don't let him see your eyes when you attack, and remember that speed is what you make of it. If he is very fast, your mind is making him fast.  Don't change where you are looking for an attack, that means that if he kicks you don't look at the leg. Keep looking at your opponent.. waiting..|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	In Krav Maga you use your aggression to subdue an attacker.  I understand that in Karate and other Martial Art styles they tell you to be calm.  This is not realistic as your fear/adrenaline will always kick in.  It's best to learn an art that is as realistic as it gets like Krav maga.  They teach you to attack with aggression but to know where to attack.  The difference between uncontrolled aggression and controlled aggression is that when you are controlled you know the parts of the body you want to strike.  The throat - Knees - groin - ears etc.  That will take down an apponent quickly.  Also you must exceded the level on aggression your attacker shows.  This is your life we are talking about...... Krav Maga also teaches how to defend against numerous attackers and weapons etc.     You will never win 100% of fights but the more realistic the fighting is when you train the better you will be when confronted by attackers.  Aggression is good when controlled.|`|LFLflsWFaa	Self-control is everything and this technique is what we take for granted everyday.    Breathe.     There are many types of breathing, that "ssh" hiss every time you hit (though not what I recommend), the deep inhale breathing from your stomach, not your lungs. The famous kiai or spirit shout...     Breathe.     Tire your opponent out, frustrate him by standing completely still with a guard on, look at his chest, not his face. Speed is not relative, your mind controls how fast or slow things are coming at you.     The answer is literally in front of you. I suggest you take some time out to do some meditation.     Best of luck.    -Angel|`|R1vos19Caa	keep doing it.   I fight in mma and the first few fights I was shaking and nervous. But, remember to train as close to a real fight as possible without causing serious injuries and just keep fighting. Eventually you will be able to control yourself even in competition.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Breathe....there is a reason why every cornerman first word during break is reminding the fighter to breathe or telling them to take a deep breath.  Breathing relax a person. In a fight, it's easy to get so worked up that you forgot to breathe and the next thing you know, you gassed. Breathing and remembering to breathe is a good mental exercise, it keeps you alert of your surrounding too.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	theres nothing wrong with anger or aggression you just need to control it and use it to your advantage.besides that once the fight has started that is when you should get aggressive its prior to the fight that you should avoid it.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Control comes with training.|`|wphUIz0naa	Aggression is want you want, anger is what you want to guard against.

cWuumdy7aa	Indian side is full of youth and reverse is the case with australia as most of the good players like warne,macgrath,gilchrist,langer,hayden,m... have left for which they have no suitable replacement. australia will go the west indies way which ruled cricket for two decades under clive lloyed and viv richards. but after all greats retired it has become very weak.|`|7oHt9fTkaa	wonder if India is on the peak,where is SA?  DON'T BE SO HAPPY of winning a series.wait till India climb to top.if not there will be nothing to celebrate then.  and don't forget!!,to climb up top India have to win series by 5-0 and  have to beat NZ by whitewash.|`|tz7JEqstaa	What?|`|IxQzS9SEaa	No matter Australia are on Decline. But this may not be the peak of Indian team as seeing the hunger of MSDhoni I feel it will go places. ICC Rankings are a bunch of Waste. India are the best in the current form. But they will improve towards a higher peak than this of now.    Most argue that SA are best. Just follow through the below details. Probably India are the best. Because in the recent two years Indian team won over all of the top countries. But if you look out for SA. They have only won against Aus.      South Africa have beaten Australia in the five-match one-day series in Australia, and that means they now displace Australia at the top of the ICC one-day rankings. The Pro teas have managed to scrape ahead of Australia by 0.21 points.    South Africa coach Mickey Arthur recently said he didnt think his team were ready to take the number one ranking. What did he exactly mean to say? Did he mean to say the South Africans are not yet a world-beating unit like the Australians have been over the last decade? Or did he mean to say the South Africans hadnt done enough to claim the number one ranking?    South Africa have no doubt been one of the most successful teams in one-day cricket over the last three years; in 2007, they won 19 of their 30 ODI appearances, while in 2008, they won 12 of their 17 ODIs, and this year, they have a 4-1 win-loss record from five matches. That converts to an overall success rate of 67%  impressive, one should say.    But a closer look at the road theyve taken reveals that theyve hardly been tested  although for no fault of theirs.    Now, a close look at the table above will reveal that Graeme Smith and Co. have played a large number of their matches against teams that have generally remained in the bottom half of the ICC rankings table  more than 19 off their 47 matches (and 18 off their 35 victories) have come against the likes of Bangladesh, Kenya, West Indies, Zimbabwe and the associate nations.    Teams in 2007 (W-L ) in 2008 (W-L)  Australia 2(0-2) 0  Bangladesh 1(0-1) 5 (5-0)  England 1(1-0) 5 (0-4)  India 3(1-2) 0  Ireland 2(2-0) 0  Netherlands 1(1-0) 0  Kenya 0 2 (2-0)  New Zealand 4 (2-2) 0  Pakistan 10 (6-3) 0  Scotland 1(1-0) 0  Sri Lanka 1(1-0) 0  West Indies 1(1-0) 5(5-0)  Zimbabwe 3 (3-0) 0    Total 30 (19-10) 17 (12-4)    Lets see how theyve fared against teams who occupy the top half of the table. Against Pakistan, who were ranked third and fourth when the two teams met in February and October 2007, South Africa beat them 3-1 in a five-match series, and then managed a narrow 3-2 win in the five-match series in Pakistan.    When pitted against the top ranked Australians, the South Africans floundered - losing both the matches they played by convincing margins. Sixth-ranked India beat them 2-1 in a three-match series in Netherlands, while they have an even two wins-two losses record against New Zealand who were ranked third when the two teams met. Add to this, the Proteas even lost a five-match series 0-4 to seventh ranked England.    So, in essence, the just concluded series against Australia is the only time the Proteas have beaten a better ranked team hands down. They have looked the better of the two teams in the series, play an exciting brand of cricket and were deserving winners. But is their performance in just that one series enough to elevate them to the number one position in the world?    Arent rankings system supposed to deliver results where teams are judged over a period of time, have beaten teams of all strengths and in all conditions? South Africa havent played a match in India, Sri Lanka or New Zealand in the last three years  so that leaves question marks over the ranking system.|`|4wPbaVzzaa	India at the Mount everest and Australians at the Mariana Trench(deepest part of the world)|`|gfxXikenaa	india will be no. 1 very soon with the way they are peaking but it will take some time for australia to fall on no. 6 or 7 with the way they are declining, few months perhaps~  cheers~|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Yeah, India has been performing well and consistently since the last 1 and half year! Ind's bench strength has been great and the most importantly the whole team is playing as a unit, enjoying each other's success. Each & every guy in the team is playing his part well, everyone is just rising to the occasion and taking up the responsibility handed over to them. The other team which has been as consistent as India is SA......And it will be interesting to see which team gets the No.1 rank in the next few months.    And Aussies's decline - well, it is the result of loosing some of it's key players!!! With so many controversies and an inexperienced side - they are not in form!!! This is the End of Aussie dominance in cricket world!|`|cPVeOThsaa	I could care less about cricket!!|`|WCX6kYITaa	I am an Indian-South African and I have affinity for both India and South Africa. You are right. Australia are in decline. Many people say that it's just a matter of time before they rebuild a strong team. But that is not absolutely guaranteed. What if they decline in the same way as England and West Indies both of which look like permanent decline? So we just have to wait and see whether Australia's decline is temporary or permanent. btw, Pakistan have gone into a more serious decline than Australia but hardly anyone has noticed. Not only are they isolated because teams refuse to tour there but their team itself is struggling. When last did they produce a superfast bowler, for example. In the past, India was regarded as the "Cricket Bank" (because they generated the money in cricket while Pakistan was regarded as the "Cricket Factory" because they produced super-talented cricketers one after the other. No more! Now India is both a cricket bank and cricket factory (Ishant Sharma is a better fast bowler than anyone Pakistan has produced in the last decade).   Back to your question, India are not at peak - they are ascending to a peak which is very good. It means that although they are awesome now, they are still getting even better. However, at the same time, South Africa are rising equally fast, maybe even faster. So we now have a situation in which the next great cricket rivalry will be between India and South Africa. Awesome!!!|`|NjN39CLZaa	Everyone's times come.  and now it's Time of India...|`|ResOYx5Naa	india still have much to prove i think they will prove it though but i still think australia can beat them in a home test series if anything than south africa should be the benchmark and lets not forget that australia did win the last test vs them without clark lee and symonds so dont write australia of just yet|`|t2Ns8Tcoaa	If india is on its peak and still only 3rd in the world, thats not very good, they have more to go, but retirements in the next few years will hurt. Australia's domestic system is too good to let us slip permanently, we will keep producing good players, its just they do not always get a run like Carseldine or Klinger are great players but can't break into our squad because of the reputation it has.|`|daMIApE6aa	The Australian cricket team are a bunch of has beens.     When discussing any current issues about top sides, it should be between 2 nations, South Africa and India.    Anybody will agree that these are currently the 2 top sides in world cricket. If India can maintain their momentum they just might give the Proteas a run for their money.|`|dJcPxDBUaa	Yep!! happy for India....  aus's performance off late has been bad.... looks like they need to play against pak to get their morale back...coz thats the only team they can beat now!  some aussie users here make u hate that nation... but to be honest all aussies are'nt bad.... so i wanna wish them good luck..  there r ups and downs in any game( even in life)... right now aus is going through bad phase just like the US economy!! itll take some time for them to comeback strong...    to end on a positive note... international cricket is at its best phase now...teams r competing well now, unlike before...Monopoly in cricket has ended!!!|`|xT1GxqVgaa	i would love this happening.i have been seeing Australians as no.1  i m bored. i need a change.|`|iZkqJIdpaa	India & South Africa, the best and they are here to stay!!!|`|AA11088802	india playing amazing cricket.. aus need to back their key players|`|5GUjFJjkaa	India are ranked third.

We'll see how good India travel when this happens to them. Ganguly and Kumble have now gone but how long will Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman play on for and how will their replacements go in the tests areana.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	The sand of times do change, as the hourglass tilts over.   India has produced quality cricketer for the future as there were concerns in the past from all corners as everyone started saying "what happens once the big three retire?"   And young players prepared themselves to fill in those big boots and the board too was on the lookout of good players. On the other hand, Australia were sitting pretty at the top and was complacent about it and nobody asked "what's next after McGrath, Warne, Gilchrist, Langer, Hayden, Martyn etc." Because everyone believed Australia could replace them at the wink of an eye. And nobody wanted to think that the Australian biggies has to retire.  The same is applicable for India too if we start thinking that 'India is doing great, and they'll continue to do so in the future too.'   India has to keep it going, we need to work harder. I hope it is not a sudden burst of ephemeral fortuity, but a sustained period of hard-earned success.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	agree|`|NR4hbYPiaa	It will be a couple of years until they play each other again, by that time both teams will be very different.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	it  must be  much more worse that Australian domination     predicted by BCCI past 2 years indirectly ~  hope it helped!!!!
CXOs4mAEaa	Pull the h Bars higher...
yEsw7UkWaa	I'm a fan of both Jeff and Matt, but I have to agree with you to a point.  I know a lot of folks will say that he isn't asking for the attention and he hasn't been marketed as a fan fave, but like all celebrities, I think he needs to take a certain amount of responsibility for his actions influencing others. Why do kids watch him? They think he's cool. Just like movie/sing stars. For us adults, it's easy to see both sides (ie..That's his public side what he does in private should be private) But kids don't see it that way. They see/hear one of their idols falling off the pedestal and they don't have the experience to separate the man from the character he plays.   And if Jeff Hardy is truly just being himself, that's fine, but he needs to remember that there are kids forking out their hard earned pocket money (in some cases) to buy the stuff that keeps him in a job.|`|VlsaWHebaa	That isn't really his MySpace, it's run by a friend, only Matt has a MySpace. Jeff had problems in the past, he lost his interest on the WWE and got depressed and got hooked on drugs but that only makes him human. Watch the DVD Twist of Fate. Now Jeff is doing better than ever. Besides if Jeff has drugs problems again, then he will be out of WWE for good.|`|SALd1Lt0aa	Lex Luger was also marketed as being kid friendly by the WWE even though in real life he was a big time drug addict who was responsible for the drug overdose death of Miss Elizabeth.|`|tl1HTJRwaa	If people look up to him that's their fault, he is not looking to be a role model to young people he is just being himself|`|foRnM8Lbaa	Sexism and Racism and Double standard in WWE; in !995 Bull Nakano gets stripped of her title and fired for possession of cocaine; fast forward to 2008--Jeff Hardy and his drug habit--no problem, keep giving him a push.|`|QQyWUDI8aa	WHAT ITCHWEEED IS BETH SHAME JEFF IS A GOOD ROLE MODEL HE IS A GOOD PERSON SO STOP DISSING HIM|`|uiRkBwa9aa	hey people have problems and jeff hasnt had a drug pro since 03. i think he is a godd person but i like matt better because ive met him personaly|`|BglekVnQaa	Hell yeah he is.

Jeff made mistakes,but he got his life togehter.He admits his mistakes and works his *** off.Hows that a bad thing to teach young people? Own up to your mistakes,and work hard at whatever your doing.Do something you enjoy in life,and dont be afraid to be yourself.sounds like a good message to me.      Also,Itchweeed is a character jeff created.Hes talking like his character there.Watch the Hardy show and youll see.    Also,beth is not itchweeed.She just runs the myspace|`|WCX6kYITaa	Jeff is a face who just happens to be popular with kids. WWE does not specifically market him as kid-friendly therefore he has no particular obligation to set a good example. In the case of John Cena, WWE specifically markets him to especially younger fans - and pay him a huge amount of money for it too (more than both Hardy's combined!). Therefore someone like Cena is obliged to set a good example for kids - both in and outside of wrestling. I don't like it, but it is what it is!|`|a0RgVoScaa	Jeff is a nut case.Period

It seemed like they were going to do a storyline with Jim Duggan for a while, when Lawler stopped him from quitting, but that kind of disappered (as do a lot of storylines!)  This is why they need the cruiser title back!  Then all of the above (except maybe Duggan) would be in the run for a title|`|SALd1Lt0aa	Hacksaw Jim Duggan for sure.

NNn84vTCaa	I wouldn't say its dissapointing, though i wasn't happy about him losing it. But, his reign was just a test in the water. I never expected it to go far, though i was hoping for it to. I mean, look at Edges first win, that lasted what, a month?     Lets look at this way;    1. Hardy winning the title at Armageddon completed a year long storyline of Hardy chasing the belt, and brought closure to his up, down and up again year, and provided a year end feel good moment.  2. The reign appeased the fans  3. First reigns for everyone are usually forgettable & throwaway reigns  4. The way Hardy was booked was done to further a storyline  5. Was he booked as a strong champion, no. Because they decided to run with a storyline which took focus away from the title, to serve a greater purpose.  6. Did Hardy deliver in the match he won the belt, yes.  7. Did Hardy deliver in the match he lost the belt, yes.  8. Did Hardy sell the storyline well, yes.  9. Was having Hardy drop the belt quickly, done for a good reason, yes.  10. Is running with a Hardy/Hardy feud bigger than Hardy having a strong reign, yes.    I think, if you look at the facts and ask did Hardy's reign serve it's purpose. Well let's see, it brought a close to the title chase storyline, and brought about another huge storyline that will be the dominant feud on Smackdown.     Will Jeff Hardy be WWE Champion again, yes. The only thing that will stop Jeff Hardy from being in the main event for a long time to come & being champion again is a failed drug test. And i think most people will find, you have more of a chance of CM Punk failing a drugs test than Jeff Hardy now. Im hoping we see Jeff vs Matt at mania for the WWE title. Mainly because Edge vs Triple H would suck, espescially for the title - i mean come on, how bad was their ONS match? And chances are, Triple H will win - regardless of his WM losing record. So, thats one major burden of Jeff losing his title. Im praying either of The Hardys win the belt before Mania. They did everything to build him up, then knocked him back down by making him lose it on his first defense. It wasn't a great reign, but as i said, it was a test in the water, he will get the belt again and have a great reign - i guarantee you.    In the end, Hardy's reign could have been a lot better, but what's done is done. The best of Jeff as a main-eventer is yet to come.    Edit; To live and Die, my bad, it was a typo, i meant Triple H vs Edge lol.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Absolutely Not.  Jeff's Run did Exactly what it was Meant to do.  It Got Him Extremely Over , & Got Matt Over as a Heel.  It ran it's Course.  Jeff's Run was Destined to be a Short one as well Anyway.  If for No other Reason than that of his Higher Risk of "Extra-Curricular" Activities.  It served it's Purpose.    But , I do agree , It's Gonna Suck when HHH wins it back (AGAIN).  That'll just makes it 13/16.  Only 4 More to Go Paul , and You've Achieved Your Mission.....        *EDIT* - Hannah ,- Jeff & Edge Never had a Match at ONS.  So how can you believe that a match between them would Suck?  IMO - Jeff/Edge would be a Great match.  If it were a Stip. Match.  Don't mean to Correct , or Sound Rude.  Just My Opinions...|`|tl1HTJRwaa	I think that this run was just to see how the fans would respond, I think we'll see another hardy reign within the next 5 - 7 months|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Not a disappointment, it just wasn't long enough. If it was longer and he defended the title more, things would have been more interesting. I hope he gets that title back soon and kicks everyones @ss :)|`|QQyWUDI8aa	well edge is a screw up he sucks he is always getting the title im a big hardy boyz fan so plz do not dis him or matt they rock|`|RJMrJN3waa	HELL YEAH he is 1 of the best wrestlers eva|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Yes, yes, yes. Jeff would have won the WWE Championship if his brother did not intervene.    Good luck|`|2rJwgk40aa	it was,yes.After everything jeff has gone through to get it,it seemed like wwe just couldnt wait to take it away from him.They never even let him defend it.Instead,they staged these stupid "accidents" as a way to keep him from defending it.I kinda feel like wwe spit in both jeffs faces and our faces.They should have let him have a good feud,defend it a few times,then have him drop it far and square.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	YES YES YES!!!!  Like I answered someone else, WWE seemed to know that some fans were getting a little bored/frustrated with the length of time it was taking Jeff to get to the title. So they offered him a deal..like we don't think your up to the job, but we're worried the fans will kill us if we don't at least let you hold the title, so you got it. But we're going to take it off you the first chance we get...oh and to make it sssoooo believable, we're going to put you through the "mental wringer" by scripting these "accidents" for you. Now, sign here please...|`|a0RgVoScaa	His reign was not memorable at all.|`|dZfrr4rPaa	I agree as far as his title reign needing to be longer, but they took it off of him to jump start his feud with Matt! Matt Hardy so far makes a great Heel but with him being so popular it had to take something huge like turning on Jeff for him to make the change! I love them both and think this feud will be great, and give the fans some good matches!!!  ...besides I think this is just one more thing he has to overcome and will end with him getting his title back!|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	It makes sense has it pushes him more as an underdog and WHEN he wins it again, he will havae the crowd behind him even more.  Not a fan of HHH title run again but when your bashing the boss' daughter, your not gonna be jobbing all over the place, are you?|`|H5EYUh69aa	IF the WWE had put the strap on Jeff and made him lose at the RR to Edge in a regular match then yes it would of been very disappointing because it would of done nothing to boost his status a little more.    BUT considering they took the belt off him early so that they could kick start ANOTHER storyline, (Matt/Jeff) then I don't think it was dissapointing because it gives Jeff another direction (as in storylines) and it opens up new doors for all areas of the main event scene.    I'm guessing that they gave the title to Hardy in the beginning due to wanting to go ahead with this storyline and I think it's good in some ways but not in others.    The bad points are that, making Jeff's first WWE title reign so short and so forgettable   (To some people maybe due to all thr hyping of these 'incidents') just for a storyline was a little stupid ... Sure, it gives his new storyline much more intensity and personal depth to it but it also takes away from the fact that he is a former WWE champion.    Hopefully though, Both Matt and Jeff can make this feud something to remember, Maybe even feud of the year ... It has that potential already.|`|9m2opi6xaa	I totally agree I love Jeff and was elated that he won the title, and the wwe knew it would sit well with the crowd look how long the celebrated right after he won very rarely do they focus on a win so much, Jeff deserved it but to keep wwe's story nice and juicy they do crap like that to lead up to the Matt and/or Christan drama. I'm just hoping they will give my man another good long run at the title just like they do people like hhh or cena

WCX6kYITaa	There's a chance both could return (if Lita is the one behind all the Jeff attacks). So maybe we could see them square off against each other and your question will be answered in the ring!|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Lita, trish wasn't that great of a wrestler just overhyped|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Trish    Good luck|`|uiRkBwa9aa	trish because i got hard seeing her on t.v. plus she was hot and i didnt think much of lita....... so yeah thats my answer|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Oooh I like the way Curious thinks.  What if it WAS Lita behind Jeff's attacks.   However, she is happy with her band on tour.  I have to agree with you about Lita losing a bit of her edge when she broke her neck, but that's only natural. I still think, overall, she was the better wrestler.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	lita|`|0KN8bX3Daa	Lita was a much Better wrestler then Trish I don't understand how you people actually think Trish was better then Lita. Trish is just a average like Michelle McCool both are extremely overrated. Lita was not a terrible wrestler late in her career and she was told not to do high risk moves because she was heel. If you watched UWF in 2007 you would see that Lita wrestled the same as she did in 2002-2004 when she wrestled Christy hemme in a tag team match.

yYQsfnVGaa	I agree with the title, but i don't agree with you about snitsky and even charlie haas. That was somewhat of a mistaken move that WWE did.

So adding Kofi makes it more interesting and exciting|`|lzbxT6p9aa	I don't think that anyone should be critisising the WWE decisions at all until after the match. For all you know, adding a couple of cruiserweights could add an extra edge to the match, it would be great to see Kofi or Rey diving off the top of one of the chambers or even off the side wall of the cage.     I'm reserving my judgement until after No Way Out.|`|H5EYUh69aa	I think guys like Rey Mysterio will be awesome in the chamber,    His style of wrestling should prove interesting inside that chamber,  It's a very confined environment and I'm interested to see what he manages to pull off move wise inside that chamber.    Kofi, I have no idea what he is doing in there, I don't even think he's on RAW all that much and if he is then he isn't impacting too much.    I don't know who decided to give this spot to Kofi but again,   He's a very athletic performer and it should be interesting.    RAW is definitly behind Smackdown on the chamber front, this year, there is no doubt about that.    But with this whole PG thing, Maybe they are trying to really prove to parents that even such matches as the elimination chamber are being bought down to suit this rating.    Rey Mysterio and Kofi are admired by mostly kids so this draws kids to the match. Therefore PPV buys.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	No, think not, my friend.

37S75c4Waa	i would recommend visiting videojug.com and looking under the sports/fitness tab it gives a better explanation about the game, its a very informative site and has helped me understand the game tremendously. i would also recommend observing other players when you're at the range to see exactly what they are doing differently from the videos you watch, understanding that everyone has a different approach to the game and understanding your body type will greatly help your swing.  i have been playing for about three months now and can actually complete a round without losing to many balls, the best advice i have received so far is to keep practicing and to actually try and score. there a two types of golfers, those that go golfing to hit balls, and those that go golfing to score. if your the latter of the two than videojug.com will be what your looking for. good luck and remember its never too hot, too cold, or too wet to golf* it can only be too windy. *(unless of course its pouring and the greens are soaked beyond maintenance)|`|IplmS6ACaa	For all the advice that you will garner from watching videos etc to improve your golf the best way is to get out as often as possible to play.|`|hrkIaMHqaa	i don't know about youtube but i do know that itunes has some free (podcasts) golf academy and golf smarter are two very good tips!    good luck!|`|sBrummATaa	try the ping lesson centers. they are probly on there|`|Wa7wktLkaa	you gotta check this bloke out. he is on videojug, but im sure you can find him on youtube as well.    rickard strongert. he has lessons on everything.    good luck and good golfing
8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	ok lets break this down    Derek fisher or Moe Williams- both are good point guards i think Williams is better at offense but fisher is a better defender.     Kobe or West- this is dumb Kobe all around i can't think of one thing that west is better at.    Walton or Lebron- another dumb one Lebron is better in every aspect of the game.     Gasol or Wallace- Wallace is better defensively but not by much Gasol is just too good offensively and too big for ben wallace.     Bynum or Big Z- Bynum is better defensively and but big Z is better offensively but i think Bynum the way he was playing he is much more aggressive.     Lakers bench or Cavs Bench- Lakers bench is so much better then the Cavs bench.     the bench play is really what it comes down to     another big thing is Kobe vs. Lebron because Kobe loves to cover Lebron. Kobe is better offensively because he can spread the floor he has a great jump shot something that Lebron really doesn't have. also i think Kobe is a much better defender then Lebron.     looking over all that i have to go with the lakers Defense wins games look at the spurs and the Celtics but i also think that the lakers have a better offense too.

ThKao2mTaa	1st pick - Larry Bird - Won the USBWA College Player of the Year, Naismith and Wooden Awards, given to the year's top male college basketball player. After his three seasons at Indiana State, he left as the fifth-highest scorer in NCAA history. Bird finished his collegiate career with an average of 30.3 points per game. He is also on the Missouri Valley Conference All-Century Team.    2nd pick - Magic Johnson - Led Michigan State University and beat Indiana State University in 1978-79 season, which was led by then senior Larry Bird.In what is still the highest-rated college basketball game ever. He was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four on that season.    3rd pick - Michael Jordan - Had a stand-out career at the University of North Carolina winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984.    4th pick - LeBron James - Arguably the best High school Basketball player drafted in the NBA.    5th pick - Kobe Bryant - one of the Better High school players   drafted in the NBA.    G0t it? Go0d!!!!|`|y8qGjcZyaa	1. Michael Jordan  2. Kobe Bryant  3. Magic  4. Bird  5.

Michael Jordan - Best player in the NBA ever, led the bulls to many championships, great leader  2. Lebron James - Can do it all, but his jumpshot is subpar for his general abilities  3. Kobe Bryant - Best shot in the NBA right now, but plays only okay defense  4. Magic Johnson - one of the best passers to play the game, slow for a point guard, small for a power forward, and doesn't really have the best jumper  5. Larry Bird - Best 3PT shot ever in the NBA, but he wasn't explosive. He was clutch, a leader, a great overall player, but yeah.|`|dffe0637ce0d1fb4a653af444962ca54aa	1. Magic Johnson - best all-around player, best teammate (doesn't play like he's the only one on the floor), you can put him in any situation and just about any position and he will win.    2. Michael Jordan - I think he and Kobe would be tied for 2nd pick but I'll list him first - what can I say?  You know what he's capable of.    3.  Kobe Bryant - what can't Kobe do? He can score 81 points in a game, play injured, play sick, he's incredibly difficult to guard - one of the most versatile all-time players and still the best in the league right now IMO.    4. Larry Bird - consistently amazing.  Allow me to quote: 24.3 points per game, 10 rebounds per game, 6.3 assists per game, 1,556 steals, a .496 shooting percentage, and a .886 free-throw percentage.  Not bad!    5. LeBron James - 2nd best player in the NBA right now and will surely take Kobe's crown soon enough.  He's amazing to watch, an incredible athlete, will def. get MVP this season - his career is already astounding and will only get better.      It's hard to rank these guys though, they could all easily be tied for 1st pick.  I ranked them mostly on how much I like them :)  (even though I like LeBron the best, he's so young I had to put him last, lol)|`|nTjAAvrOaa	1) MJ -- best ever  2) Lebron -- most complete player in the NBA right now  3) best clutch player ever after MJ  4) Magic  5) Bird    If Magic and Bird played in today's league they'd get roughed up and wouldn't be as effective, so you have to take that into consideration in your question.|`|KYaM65gzaa	kobe and lebron have not done enough to warrant being in the same sentence as the other three. the first three are legends kobe and lbj have that potential (not to be as good as MJ tho) but they have to win some stuff and prove it to us.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Michael Jordan.

He has won more titles than any of the players ranked under him. Magic is 2nd because he was a very good versatile player that could play every position on the court. He has also won more championships than the guy I have ranked under him: Larry Bird who is ranked  3. I picked Kobe for  4 because he has more experience than the guy under him: Lebron who's ranked  5. Not to mention, Kobe has more NBA rings and MVP trophies than Lebron right now. Remember though, Lebron is just 24 years old and has plenty of time to win a title and MVP trophy.|`|ujMsLUcNaa	1. Michael Jordan (You don't need a dominant big men to win a championship as long as you have Jordan.  Only players on this list who could make this claim.)    2. Magic Johnson (One of the few players who could play all 5 positions very effectively.  Has an uncanny vision for seeing the floor and making plays happen.)    3. Larry Bird (The ultimate competitor who was a threat to score anywhere on the court.  A very well rounded small forward / power forward who had very little weaknesses.)    4. LeBron James (Doesn't have the rings Kobe has but he also never played with a center like Shaq or had a pool of talented big men (Odom, Gasol, and Bynum) around him either.  Has proven he can put a team on his back and carry them to the NBA Finals.)    5. Kobe Bryant (A Jordan clone minus the defensive tenacity, leadership attitude, and the clutch ability to excel at a high level in the NBA Finals.)|`|FUoKu13Daa	One of the best and interesting question yet,    I think if no one knew how well each of these players would turn out Then I think it would go like this    LBJ,  Bird, Johnson, Jordan and Kobe,  the reason why I put it in that order is Kobe was pick 16 in his draft, Jordan was picked 3 or 4 in his draft, LBJ was so much hype in high school so I believe he would be picked first and Bird was college player of the year and Johnson team won the NCAA tournament and he was also looked after favorably.    If they knew how well they would have ended up playing then I would go this way,    Jordan, Magic, Bird, Bryant and then LBJ, the reason i put it in this order is simply Jordan had more succes than any of them so far, it might change but as of now he has had more success than the rest, Magic had the second most success than the people that are left and Bird and Kobe is close but the jury is still out on the success of Kobe post Shaq era, and LBJ had not won anything yet,|`|mQEANwhOaa	1.

uduydfcUaa	Well ask ur coach if u can study the team when they play if they have any more games before yours.Try to spot the weaker players and exploit their weakness.try to get ur back court players to really concentrate on the game cause they have the best view. Then at timeouts get the back court players to tell what they have learned about the opponents. it would be best to play against them anyway because you will learn from this match whether you win or lose. if you lose it might open the coaches eyes to what to work on  Hope this has helped
DPlJiWyWaa	It's great to see a true fan of their team that hasn't changed.  I am positive that there would've been a fair amount of Lions fans change teams as a result of the 0-16 record.  I do feel sorry for them, they used to be a half decent team that just went downhill and crashed and burned.  They went through a lot also with the loss of players, Matt Millen fiasco and so much more so that is not helping the team one bit.    Stick with you team though, they'll be good one day.|`|tWUQU4Juaa	All I can say is look at what the Miami Dolphins did with a change of leadership at the top  .

The dolphins proved that you can go from worst to first.  And you guys have a better team than the dolphins had when they turned it around.  Oh. And i was just like you when the ravens were 5-11 in 2007.  I has al the excuses in the world.|`|8816fe6eb0864760b3fcfaf44e012d7faa	HA HA HA HA HA , 0-16, F*cking righteous|`|4gRCqmD6aa	they are bad.     but look on the bright side, your team wasn't as bad as the 1976 tampa bay buccaneers, you guys were actually competitive in some games.|`|yZK8NcnSaa	Hey man, I live in WV. We don't have a pro team so u get fans of every team here. I'm a Bengals fan. Have been all my life. So I feel some of your pain. My brother is a Lions fan. Has been since Barry. The glory days huh? I like them too. Its gotta get better right? You can't lose 17 this comin year. When I thought the Bengals were on the up-swing I got to experience the Playoffs for 2 plays until Carson got his leg snapped into. The Lions will get it.

No team should have to go 0-16.    But I give you props for being a true fan and sticking with them through their hard times. It will make the day they win the Super Bowl THAT much better.|`|ULw1777caa	It was unreal this season for them.  I was always a big Barry Sanders fan and it is rough watching them lose.  I hope things turn around this year for them.|`|mxXwQRfxaa	I'm a 49ers fan.  I love the Lions!  They even manage to make the niners look good.  ;)|`|FZRWMc3Baa	Is the day Millen got fired a holiday in Detroit now?  It should be.  The Lions should slowly improve over the next few years.

Cena invokes rematch clause the following night on Raw but Jericho DQ's himself. Stephanie comes out and declares at Wrestle mania it will be Orton VS Cena Vs Jericho for WHC.  I personally don't like it because ever since WM XX and Benoit/HHH/HBK pulled off a great triple match, Creative now believe if you throw 3 of your top guys in the ring at the same time will make a great match and it doesn't i.e. WM 24 Orton/HHH/Cena sucked hard.

4DcvpQXfaa	FAIR    good for bobcats they got center and 1 scorer!    goof for clippers the got perimeter defender,they suck in there and 1 combo guard!|`|D6Llh23Baa	i think bobcats would rather trade felton, instead of augustin. augustin is a rising star and larry brown loves him manning the point. and what would happen to charlotte when they receive camby? you have two defensive and no offense big men in okafor and camby.  and with the clippers, i think they want thornton more than wallace. al has more upside and he is still young.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	I think the Clippers are getting somewhat a bad deal. Gerald Wallace is great and all, but for Al Thornton, a rising star, and a Camby that has improved his game and is a prime center in the West? However, the Clippers do have Chris Kaman currently on the injury list and when he comes back he will probably put up similar numbers to Camby's. D.J. Augustin is a suitable backup for Baron Davis, or a starter in case Davis gets injured, which is frequently. Overall I'd give this trade an 8 out of 10.|`|TbEwkoQDaa	I think it would be a good trade, since Camby has been a good center and a great defensive player.  Wallace brings energy and leadership on the floor.  Thornton has been playing good and has been consistent on scoring.  This would be a good trade,|`|VRN4A8vwaa	It's a huge lost for both team    Bobcats lost their future PG and also their key player and Clippers lost their future SF and their best C|`|lVPRQj9faa	no way. the clippers wouldn't trade their best defender and a rising star in Al Thornton.|`|LllekK48aa	Doesn't Wallace have a forty percent collapsed lung?|`|rPWOZobHaa	There's something fishy about this..... Yeah this is fake too bad for all you suckers who fell for it
4DcvpQXfaa	yes conley could be good teammate for oden,they were teammate in HS year!    and grizzlies got 1 young PF/SF|`|D6Llh23Baa	good trade. one of the better trades we could see. but i just don't see this happening. memphis won't give up conley just for outlaw. outlaw is a really good player. but what memphis needs right now is not to really trade. but to just improve their plays. gay and mayo are ball-stoppers. they need to distribute the ball even better.|`|b0eYeLG1aa	might work out|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	Not that bad of a trade.....Outlaw will probably be starting then maybe move Mayo to PG, Gay to SG, and Outlaw to SF?|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Not too bad but still not that good|`|VRN4A8vwaa	It's a huge loss for Blazers    Blazers lost their status as a team that have the best 2nd string in NBA because they already don't have another better SF and the combination of OJ, Gay, and Outlaw is pretty good enough to improve their rank|`|lVPRQj9faa	good trade. could benefit both teams.
4DcvpQXfaa	good trade but won't happen i guess    RIP is enjoy as 6thman now!|`|65PS8shGaa	no. they just resigned hamilton|`|b0eYeLG1aa	nope|`|TbEwkoQDaa	It may not be a good trade since Pistons has already Rasheed Wallace playing at Power Forward.  Sixers can either win if this trade happens because Sixers play well even without Elton Brand.  Pistons just need to play as a team, for the meantime they just badly need a pointguard to orchestrate the play.|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Could be a good trade but I think Pistons resigned Hamilton|`|TrfDfpV0aa	nope brand is out for the season with a shoulder injury and they need to keep hamilton because iverson will be gone next year and it will be hamilton and stuckey starting at guard next year|`|LllekK48aa	It could benefit both sides, but I doubt it would happen.|`|lVPRQj9faa	not gonna happen. the pistons just need a better point guard then allen iverson. they did way better with Chauncey. But it would benefit the Sixers because they have proved that they can still play good without Elton Brand in the lineup. But i doubt that this trade would happen.
95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	Buying scuba gear online can have it's pitfalls. If it needs to fit you, not somebody else and if it's part of life support, like a reg set don't buy it online. Hit your local dive shop. It's no good if it doesn't fit, compatible with other gear or possibly a factory second. Things like dive knives, gloves and the like, sure, knock yourself out. But body exposure protection and regs are not something you should be purchasing online. You also need to think ahead for your gear service. If your local dive shop doesn't deal those regs you bought online, you'll be shipping them off to whomever you bought them from ( paying for that too) and not seeing them for awhile. Then there's the question of warranty etc.   Chances are, you'll get just as good a deal hitting your local shop. If you're buying it all, they'll usually toss in a hefty discount..|`|fHJqqMzLaa	Check   http://www.visibilityunlimited.com  We have quite a few customers from over the pond.

giWvSwqRaa	Wushu?|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	First off your posted link is not even close to a REAL martial art at all. This is called tricking and has been made popular by a sales system called XMA created by Mike Chat which combines gymnastics, dance and martial art techniques...but it is not a real martial art at all...and is not part of the "ninja" training.    That being said if you are moving to Japan and you do this kind of stuff over there you are going to get hammered and laughed at. I trained in Okinawa and Japan but the dojo I attended you have to be invited to...or at least a member of those "traditional and authentic" martial art systems (ie. Goju Ryu, Shuri Ryu, etc). If you want to get into a true school in Japan you will need a letter of introduction from an authentic Sensei that will help you get through the door. If not you may not be allowed to train with them unless you have no prior training and then you will start with the beginners.    Ryouko is not a martial art but a bunch of people who did train in martial arts who are tricking...that is it.|`|bCp9wZgSaa	Ahh Grasshopper all the martial arts are alike in that they come from one source the human body and each human adapts the art to his personality and physical strenghts.  Buddha's name be praised.
QQyWUDI8aa	well im going to tell you a story    Eduardo Gory Guerrero (October 9, 1967  November 13, 2005) was a Mexican-American professional wrestler born into a Mexican wrestling family. He wrestled in Mexico and Japan and in several major professional wrestling promotions in the United States He wrestled in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Guerrero's personality was that of a crafty, resourceful wrestler who would do anything to win a match. His catch phrase became "Cheat to Win." Despite being a heel for most of his career, he got over in and outside the ring. Another one of his famous slogans was "I Lie! I Cheat! I Steal!," which was used in one of his entrance themes. He partly used this phrase in his autobiography Cheating Death, Stealing Life.    Throughout his career, Guerrero encountered various substance abuse problems outside of wrestling, including alcoholism and an addiction to painkillers. His problems outside of the ring were sometimes integrated into his angles. Notwithstanding these issues, he won numerous titles during his career, including the WWE Championship. He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006.    Guerrero was known for his "I Lie, I Cheat, I Steal" motto where he often wins matches by using cheap tactics. Common tactics were:    Playing possum while opponent holds a steel chair, appearing that the opponent had attacked him. With this usually the referee was already knocked out, and whilst playing possum, Eddie would sit up and try and shake the referee awake.   Smashing the chair on the mat to make it sound like someone was hit then tossing the chair to his opponent, whilst lying on the ground pretending to be have actually been hit.   Low blowing the opponent while the referee replaces steel chair.   Also, when champion or facing a champion in a non title match, Eddie would sometimes use the championship belt in a similar way to the steel chair, by throwing it to his opponent and lying on the mat pretending to have been hit by it.     well there is story i think it is small|`|oj4rIETkaa	because he absolutely ate, slept and drank pro wrestling like few others, he lived for the business and unlike Benoit and Malenko who were both incredibly talented wrestlers, he had a much more magnetic and charismatic personality, not even the legendary Bret Hart can match him on that one|`|vdh6cwUvaa	Guerrero really came from a wrestling school. So he knows all the wrestling techniques. And he's good at the mic.|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	watch rey vs eddie summerslam 05 then u will know|`|7ACBEowxaa	everything, Eddie had the wrestling skills    Charisma, the look, the fans loved him, and when he was heel, they loved hating him,  he was truly the very best at what he did, you want to know how great eddie was, watch him on youtube, or buy his DVD,    he was an amazing person/and performer.|`|t1uKdzmLaa	For one, his wrestling ability (he was very athletic and versatile in that department). In addition, he was very charismatic (excellent mic skills, hilarious backstage segments, awesome gimmicks as a whole throughout his career). That is why I thoroughly enjoyed watching him during his wrestling career.|`|uiRkBwa9aa	purely entertaining!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( i likd the fued with rey mysterio over dominik)|`|ONuy5vniaa	Flawless wrestling, and a great showman.    when in his prime, he was great at everything required to be a wrestler.    Before he was in his prime, he improved constantly, very hard working and passionate about his performance.    Something that guys like cena or Batista wouldn't  know anything about.

xThpp6e9aa	No...theres plenty of women that tall on the womens tour wormen play in the wta no matter how tall they are|`|o2WdAKZbaa	It's funny how Maria Sharapova's height keeps increasing by an inch every couple months. If that were the case she better watch out or she will be 7'0 tall by the end of '09. She is more than likely around 6'1 maybe 6'2 at the most. There are a few 6 footers in the WTA. (Venus, Lindsay, Dinara, etc) So that's pretty messed up asking if she should play in the ATP when it's clearly based on sex and not size.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I've no idea why you think height should play a factor of what gender people play tennis under. I'd say that'd be one very insulting thing to say to someone like Maria, Ivanovic, Dementieva the Williams, Safina and the others people have named.   I think i heard somewhere on something that the average height of a female tennis player is 6'.. maybe it was the man? Maybe not considering you have the big boys like Del Potro, Berdych, Guccione, Safin...|`|5nzgNWalaa	you're either being cheeky or you don't know anything about the tennis!    anyway sharapova is not the tallest female player. The tallest successful player I can think of is Lindsay Davenport.|`|K9vkUIIAaa	no cause sharapova is a lady, and ladies play the wta while men play on the atp.    and height doesnt matter.|`|s7l6oZANaa	noo.. coz maria is a girl.. and shes has to play on the WTA..look at dinara safina... shes soo tall!! and shes plays in the wtp|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Height is not a determinant of whether or not a person needs to play in either WTA or ATP. Sharapova is actually near 6'2" (near 188cm). She is born a female. She absolutely makes no wonder why she enters WTA. Although being 6' high is a little bit higher than average height of the all men around the world, that doesn't make a person as high as that male. Look at most of the WTA players today. Most of them are at least 5'7" (170cm) high, and for the top women players in WTA like Jankovic, Safina, Ivanovic, Venus and Serena, Mauresmo, Davenport, Dementieva, they are all measured at/higher than 175cm in height, plus numerous others that I don't mention here, should they all enter ATP too?|`|9nCXigX0aa	she could play any sport or activity and still look so hot!|`|gWLhIoIiaa	no because she has a vag|`|9pLdhuBnaa	No, there are several other tall women on the WTA Tour.  Also, there are some men on the ATP Tour that are on the short side.  One player that could probably fit in to the category of being on the short side is Nikolay Davydenko.  He is 5'10".  I found this out from the ATP Tour website.
AA12274507	I have both and the only thing that comes close to what you are saying is the after market sks mag that is basically a AK mag with a big old chunk of metal welded on it to make it fit. You are wasting your time. I bought my SKS with this mag you are talking about. I got rid of it very quickly. I have a 20rd Fixed which is just like the stock magazine except it holds 20 rounds instead of 10. Stripper clips is the best way to go.

7fvzJIqvaa	Energy drink -   Today's top players are religious about their nutrition:    Before: Maximise glycogen stores before play using hi-carb nutrition for carbo-loading.   During: Replenish used-up glycogen at a maximum rate using complex carbohydrate-protein drinks.   After: Most importantly they recover using high-protein and carbohydrate drinks.  For top players the order of importance is as follows:    Recovery - Make sure you have a good recovery strategy. If not your progress will slow down soon and you end up with injuries and a poor immune system. These symptoms of overtraining can be prevented with a good recovery strategy.     Energy drink - Poor rehydration and energy and electrolyte suppletion will cause you to tire sooner and loose concentration after a while. For optimal performance en endurance a tennisplayer must optimise its glycogen levels during matches and training. Use a professional sports drink with comples carbohydrates and amino acids just before and during matches and training. A good sportsdrink will replenish your glycogen during the training at a maximum and even level. Carbohydrates taken in combination with amino acids are easier absorbed and better utilised. Timing and volume of intake and adjustment to weather conditions are of great importance. For this he will need to have the best available energy drink and take it at the right time.   Immune system - Keep your immune system strong and avoid injuries. By using the right nutrition the immune function can be supported. By using a good recovery strategy and providing your body with the nutrients needed for healthy joints, tendons and muscles injuries can be prevented and the recovery of injuries can be accelerated.   Carbo-loading - Matches can last for up to five hours and the carbohydrate fuel stores of the player are likely to be challenged.Carbo-loading before important events can provide you with the energy edge in long extended matches. Endurance athletes can not erform to their best without well planned carbohydrate loading.    The great importance of recovery - Professional players training are devoted to on-court practice but all will have additional conditioning work such as running, weight training and agility work. Such daily activity levels will challenge the athlete's ability to fully rebuild their glycogen stores between bouts. Insufficient recovery of depleted stores of glycogen will result in a build-up shortage over time resulting in deminishing performace, overtraining and injury.    Recovery without using carbohydrates and proteins immediately after training will last up to 36 - 40 hours. The use of a ordinary energy drink in the first two hours after trainig will reduce this to 20 - 24 hours. Only recently drinks using a combintion of carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids were developed that reduce recovery time to 16 hours if used within the first 30 minutes after exercise. This is the best we can do and is just enough for athletes who train over a period of 8 hours per day.     We have developed a programme of nutrients especially for tennis to be taken before, during and after exercise:    B.load is designed to maximise the the glycogen levels if taken up to two hours before major events or a major bout of exercise utilising mainly longchain glucose polymers.   B.fuel is designed to maintain hydration during exercise whilst providing some energy in the form of a combination of carbohydrates.   B.gain combines protein and carbohydrates to promote fast recovery, muscle resynthesis and growth.|`|o2WdAKZbaa	I couldn't have said it better than benton_h.

But here's the thing.  Why aren't the Knicks fans rooting for their own team to win the game against the Cavs and Lakers when they have one of the best coaches in the NBA?!|`|HLzS2z9laa	its harder for Lebron to score 63 because he cant shoot like Kobe, but its harder for Kobe to get a triple double because he's not the athlete James is, Id rather have 50 point game and a triple double|`|iz5zDFxvaa	Doesn't matter.

What did Kobe do other than score.  Oh yeah... he said... "Pau, pass me the ball so I can shoot.  Oh, Pau and Lamar, make sure you work the boards, cuz I'm going to be too busy shooting to even get 1 rebound"  Kobe's performance was nothing.  I don't care if he scored 61, he made more shots than anyone else on either team attempted.  If thats not a ball hog, I dont know what is.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	I think his triple double is more impresive and respectable than Kobe's 61.

fPPPeXhcaa	I am 14 and I just started running Cross Country last fall!    1. There really is no way to run it easily.  ~ Don't think about running. Try to get a song stuck in your head, spell words, or just zone out.  2. Some tips to do really well are to get in shape. You really have to push yourself. When you are running up a hill, pretend that your coach is at the top and is propeeling you up by a rope. It works for me. Even when you feel like you can't, do a pick-up. A pick-up is when you go just a little bit faster. And try to stay in a group when you run.  3. When I ran the 4km my time was 19:10. Your first race should probably be around 20:00.    And for your last question. Really, you just have to go out there and run every race like it is your last.|`|65ZUyCJ6aa	1. To run it easily you will need to start building up your aerobic capacity, energy. That is what makes you last longer with far distances. Swimming is a great way to build this up, or even going for a jog every second day will be great. Start running about 1km and then each week go up 500m or so until it comes to cross country.You will see when your running that you will last alot longer then you did before.    2. To do well, I would say when you are racing to keep confident, focused, dont look back just keep running. Dont let your friends or other competitors distract you.    3. I wouldnt worry about time for now, all you want to do is run, run, run and run some more.    I hope you do well. Good luck!    I|`|9f5b1b66abb2e221655727d226546d68aa	walk at least 10,000 steps a day.
DOB4tbquaa	Good question! Mountain climbing is an aerobic sport similar in physiological cost to the same hours spent distance running, jogging, hiking fast up-hill and so on.     I'm no dietician, but for me its complex carbs the day before, mostly vegetables (great source of carbs and filled with vitamins which your body will need the next day), some whole grains and loads of fruit (always). I avoid meat or hard to digest pulses.   The morning of climbing some supplements and the usual cereal and fruit.    Good luck, and be careful as always. :-)|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Complex carbs - like everyone has said.  Pastas usually.  Avoid gassy foods like broccoli.    For breakfast, I get another does of carbs - instant mashed potatoes.  They come in a variety of flavors and are so, so yummy!|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Like the poster above said Carbs the night before...think pastas, potatoes, and whole grains.  The morning of I like to have oatmeal with raisins, cranberries, and of course Cinnamon. An apple or dried fruit before helps too..the fruit gives you the sugar you need, the oats provide carbs and will keep your stomach happy.
245xte16aa	No freakin' way. It's another form of defense. But this kind of bullshit should be illegalized:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiK51nxUi...|`|KYaM65gzaa	im almost certain theres no rule against. however i never do it and never will. definitely fair to say its bad sportsmanship, very lacking in class. its just unfortunate you had to play against someone with that poor of an attitude. im used to this myself and find the reason the first few times it happens to you many will airball that is cause the guy doesnt get to you in time hence yells or screams, it catches your attention while youre in the air with the ball and even if you dont move your head in surprise to look at him your eyes likely catch him especially if hes waving his arms about as well as he sprints towards you, not realising how much of a moron he looks and sounds like. my advice and what worked for me is just come to expect it and dont let your eyes divert from where youre shooting towards even for a split second. gets easier with time.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	That's legal clearly because the ref would have done something if it's not. I think they should call a foul to people that does that because it ruins the game. It is bad sportsmanship. I think you should just forget aabout it. Next time just go drive hard if he's guarding you and run him over. wHo cares if you get called for a charge. tHat'll teach him.|`|LllekK48aa	Here, let me tell you something that works. It seems like absolute total BS, but if you want to, give it a try.    If they yell at you when you shoot, do it back to them when they shoot if you're close by. If you aren't that close, then run head first into him, but DO NOT headbutt him. He'll get the hell scared out of him and trust me, it works. They pay more attention to this guy who's running straight into their balls instead of the basket.|`|j6NImFHgaa	Yes people can do that, and well, that was a tough situation for you. But you see NBA players get treated very badly all the time and they have fans do worse to them. But in your case, you should just learn to not let people in the audience distract you. I mean, if you concentrate on that negative stuff that fans do, how will you be a good player? You have to learn to zone them out. Like me, I played basketball all throughout highschool, and I was the best shooter. Do you think if I thought about all the people in the crowd and if I was to pay attention to the negative people all the time, I would have been able to make all the shots that I did? - So my advice to you is to zone it out. Those people dont know you, so let it slide. Of course they are gonna try to make you mess up, they dont want you to win. So zone it out as well as you can. Good luck|`|9Oxu5CIoaa	Depends on the league. The guy sounds like an asshole though. Up by 30 and he is still going through all that to make you miss? You should have beat him up after the game.
2SRIv128aa	Ronaldinho for sure. Beckham is a great player, but is nowhere near his peak as England captain and member of Manchester. He is deadly accurate but not a great allrounder like Ronaldinho.|`|TxVAXBpTaa	Oh Dear.. I have to laugh at all Americunts who answered this question.. They are ignorant and don't know that Beckham has been playing well for Milan.. He help his teammate with great assists..Whereas, Ronaldinho is struggling, and becoming fat, lazy, and useless..!!!!|`|lEPcXjkgaa	Beckham has a great player in his prime but that has well past now and i think ronaldinho is about to light the soccer world on fire|`|RZhRqp06aa	Its not a matter of who is better. They are different players. Italians use players according to tactics. Beckham is there to supply Pato & Kaka. He is great at passing, freekicks & corners. He also does a lot of covering & defence & allows Zambrotta more freedom to break down the right. Ronaldhino is being used by Ancelotti on the left hand side. Milan is weaker on that side offensively - bottom line Ron is there as an attack option in the last 15m of a game to secure a win.|`|ipznrSQyaa	Beckham because Ronaldinho is not giving his best while Beckham is giving it|`|QUIrETvAaa	I personally believe Ronaldinho deserves a position on the starting 11. This brief stint with Milan for Beckham wont last as long as his recent form will. Beckham is great for free kicks, but his agility and reflexes has certainly gone down since his early days at Madrid. With this said I should mention Dinho does seem to be risky aswell. I believe he needs as much time as he can get in the starting 11 to prevent a repeat of his last months in Barcelona. Who knows, Milan certainly have two very skillfull players at hand. Of course, Ancelotti could always decide to change the formation to something which would suit both players.     Milan are definitely a force to be reckoned with this season.|`|8QxVjXUxaa	right now, its beckham. milan is now using 4-3-1-2 where pato and kaka lead the attack with seedorf working as an attacking midfielder/shadow striker. and in the midfield its ambrosini-pirlo-beckham/flamini. if they take out beckham and put in ronaldinho, that means seedorf will go to where beckham has played. however seedorf is doing very well (soo well that he started every single game of the season) in attacking midfield and beckham's passing, set-pieces, playmaking with pirlo and covering for zambrotta is just outstanding. ambrosini is doing what gattuso and flamini were doing before they both got injured so there is no problem with neither attack nor midfield. so i think beckham is the right choice for milan right now.|`|SIJMvR8waa	beckham is old and crap, the only reason they play him is so they can sell some t-shirts  ronaldinho shits all over him|`|t9jz9tMqaa	Beckham.    Beckham is in form 2 goals and 2 assist last 5 games.    Ronaldinho is getting out of shape and has sat his rear on the bench the last 4 games.|`|8f0q10ppaa	mate,  seriously it has to be Ronaldinho!  hes the worlds best player....noones better!  cheers|`|c4GykfVkaa	I don't like either of them. They're good players but somehow i came to hate them as an AC milan fan and I was in a shock when I learned about the transfers! However, I'd say Beckham. He is not better than ronaldinho as a player but in Milan he's more helpful in scoring|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	Ronaldinho doesnt really help Milan at all, you would expect better players in Milan, but Beckham is miles ahead of Ronaldinho right now.|`|7F6p9Gm9aa	DINHO|`|wi0CSqNSaa	Ive seen this question like 6 times Ronaldinho is way better.

dI3Q89i8aa	It depends...    When you sign up to jump you'll be given a health and fitness form to sign. If you have none of the medical conditions listed you just sign and you're good to go.    If you do have any e.g. spinal problems, epliepsy, athsma or if you are over 40 you will need to speak to your GP/consultant first and get them to sign the doctor's portion of the form.    Normally I wouldn't think you'll need an examinaiton (as they'll go on your test results/notes). But if you do it'll be in the privicy of a doctor's surgery with only the doc in the room.    If need to find a place to do it or have any questions www.dropzone.com (forum and DZ locator) or www.bpa.org.uk (british parachute association) are 2 very good sites.

YiDVUCdwaa	b/c your body is different than that of someone that is 205lbs you wont brun exactly the same amount of calories but you will burn more calories than you would without the extra weight. Instead of running with a weight in a bookbag you may want to invest in a weighted vest or ankle weights instead. Having a weight in a bookbag could cause injury to your back if the weight isnt strapped tightly around your body. The weighted vests are made for impact exercises so you wont have as much of a risk.|`|kDshEkXraa	Not exactly, but close yeah.  So in my understanding your body has to work to pump blood and oxygen to all of your mass, even though you would weigh 205 your body would still only be working to pump O's to 185 pounds.  So I'd think you'd burn slightly fewer calories, but not much fewer.|`|qYgLuDYkaa	yup|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	you would be in the same ballpark.  As stated before, your body won't work exactly like 205 lb man, so it will be a little off.  Also, more importantly, this will really screw up your running form, likely making you more inefficient.  While that will burn more calories, it will also greatly increase the likelihood of you hurting yourself.  I would strongly recommend that you do not run with weights.  You will screw up your knees and ankles.  Just work on running faster in the same amount of time, and you will burn more calories that way.
cKXZOLJSaa	You just need to learn how to pace yourself,  get a running buddy and run on your own time and get better at it.  Don't let your coach tell you that you're a puss, prove him wrong!  :]|`|AA10241450	Your coach has seen the progression of many runners and it is mind over matter since your brain controls your muscles.  Progression does take time hopefully your just at a barrier phase and will break through soon.      Breaking 5 minutes can take time - so more adequate questions are how fast are your 400 meter times, 800 meter and 5K times?  How are you training?  Is it smart training?  For instance are your 400 meter race time under 54 seconds and 800 meter time under 2:10.  Is your 5K under 18 minutes?  Also are you running mile intervals along with 400 and 200 meter intervals?     If your 3rd lap is slower it means you need work on endurance training mostly repetition of a combination of aerobic miles and running 400 meter (8 x 400 meters at 1 mile race pace) and 1 mile repeats (4 X 1 mile at 5K race pace).  Your rest periods should get down to 120 heart beats per minute. You should aim at getting your aerobic miles around 6 minute per mile for instance for 5 miles.  In addition, work out with resistance training - for instance squats, lunges and other leg and arm drills.  Running does take dedication and will get easier as you progress.  I'm sure when Spring comes your be able to run under 5 minutes. Good luck!|`|oqiH3fCCaa	I think that it mostly depends on how they act when you aren't practicing. My coach will yell at us and such but as a teacher he is great and after practice or when ever the team is together but not practicing, he is a fun guy and will get burritos with us. Most good coaches will have their own way of being honest or being a jerk but it's often just to push you to get better. I think that a 4:40 mile is a great goal for you.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	You probably just don't know how to pace yourself correctly.  Try going a tad bit slower on the first two laps and then speed up towards the end.    & no, you're not a crappy runner.  You definitely can do it, though.  Keep working hard!|`|OsjT9jszaa	I do agree with your coach saying that a lot of this sport is mental.  But if your current PR is a 5:10, don't expect to just drop to a 440 just like that.  Now, I do think you can get that fast after a couple months of tough training and really focusing on it.      Make sure you pace yourself during your mile.  Don't explode on the first half if you always die. Maybe back off a little so you have more juice for the second half.  Maybe with that you will get closer to breaking 5

But yeah i guess most players will be experienced and at their peak in maybe their late 20's early 30's.|`|7oHt9fTkaa	if you take JAYASURIYA  I'LL TELL 39+|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	usually,...28-32  cheers~|`|8w9JZlaGaa	don't talk like Hayden|`|z4UGwO7taa	it Depends...Talents.. 20 - 30  =)|`|cy16ihq1aa	i dont think age has anything to do with it....    But i think 30 is a good age...  Sachin, Ponting and co played well when they were 30....  Jayasuriya is playing well and he's 39 i think....|`|zoB64Ymoaa	around 27-33  eg Mitchell Johnson - 27  Nathan Bracken - 31  Simon Katich - 33  Michael Clarke - 27  Shane Watson - 27  Shaun Tait (exception) - 25    Just to name a few    oh and ah Ricky Ponting - 34  ?|`|KYf9yhvLaa	Yes for some players its 30 but most of them reach their full peak by 27.|`|7XSbpyCaaa	i think it's in his mid 30s|`|yec64oeoaa	yeah about 30|`|OdMZtz7Zaa	Then wait for this professional cricketer     Sahid Afridi|`|k7KZizRTaa	28-32  during this time frame,he plays both aggressive and matured game|`|gtOPJoUraa	if you take JAYASURIYA  people would say, 40 +  jayawewa|`|ckCXAF5Waa	BATSMAN  For a batsman it is 27-31 years . A batsman needs to be matured enough to play his game & therefore its this age ..    BOWLER  For a bowler it is 23-28 years .   -Pace bowlers need to be energetic and hence young .  -Spin bowlers may be a little older than the age mentioned above .|`|AA11088802	for me 30-32|`|f9hiPMDxaa	It shouldn't really have anything to do with their age. If they are good enough, they are old enough.|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	28
245xte16aa	Ridiculous. If they do the trade it's like departing with Garnett part 2. The Wolves have been winning games lately, why ruin it again?|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Horrible.  Plus the T Wolves are not giving up Jefferson.  He is there foundation they are trying to build around.|`|884gmUZBaa	No, that's never going to happen.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	Dude, look, the Lakers got a great player (Gasol) in return for trash (Kwame, Crittenton) last season.    If another dumb *ss trade like that one were to go through I'd boycott the NBA. Because that would just be unfair.    No way in hell Lebron, Wade, Stoudemire, Bosh etc, are going to sign with the Wolves. I don't care how much cash they have to throw around. Without Jefferson or Miller why would they sign with that team? They don't have any talent to play with! You think after what Garnett went through anyone wants to go there?    You sound like another Laker fan in panic mode because Bynum went down again.     C'mon Laker fans, think about the other team for a change when proposing these ridiculous trades.    LOL @ "Katherine L"|`|4DcvpQXfaa	NOPE    lakers big man would be the best with this trade!    and t'wolves will lost franchise player!|`|lVPRQj9faa	bad trade. Minnesota already has a good center and a good shooting guard with them.|`|LllekK48aa	No. Can't have Bynum, Gasol, and Jefferson on the same team. And also, I don' think T-Wolves are willing to replace their starting center with Chris Mihm.|`|Qj7QlmwSaa	This is pathetic|`|w2Ao2uNwaa	NO WAY|`|9vnH7LS5aa	cocaine is a dangerous drug, don't do too much of it.|`|bKdNZTvTaa	Of course people are going to come at you wrong your just plain crazy to think the timberwolves would give up Al Jefferson for basically Odom, your more then crazy so when Bynum gets back you going to start Jefferson at small forward? Umm no never, and YES Jefferson is a franchise player he's only 24 putting up big numbers like he is so stop with the bullshit
KOM1Bki8aa	everton may move grounds to kirby,    burglars in kirby steal socks off the line first, and then wear these as gloves as not to leave fingerprints !|`|uuQDWo49aa	im a cardiff fan and got 1 thing 2 say liverpool wat was the score oh liverpool wat was the score|`|c65125310c801112d2ca421b6ef869edaa	Giggs is correct.  In KIRKBY they are known as sock robbers.|`|rzPMzoxzaa	The scousers are scared because Kirkby will have a better team than they have.They couldn,t even beat our youth team.ie Gosling and Rodwell.|`|LtbINp1jaa	maybe its socker!?|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Because the dirty liverpool fans thought it would be ok to throw stuff on the pitch|`|B7LyNQtBaa	because the liverpool fans where upset about the tackle.

Its spelt Kirkby, its an old norse word, Kirk meaning church, by meaning by (surprisingly), so its Kirkby meaning 'by the church'    As for the slurs I have told you this before,    Number of crimes per100,000 in Manchester    179.25    In Liverpool    135.26    Sorry forgot, your not a Manc are you?    Lets try Westminster in central London    275.58    Edit  No Phil, thats recorded crime per 100,000 population per year    You can read it for yourself from this Official Government site    http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/ia/atla...    Read and weep    Edit  Phil, not as much as Manchester likes to steal cars you seen that figure?|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Liverpool were feeling the heat.|`|PYiQGwsAaa	Ref Neil, the liverPOO stats of crime (135.26) is that per night? Unlike Manchester or Westminster where it takes weeks to reach their figures.    Edit - Sorry Gingerlatic please forgive me, in answer to your question, i have no idea    Edit 2 - Nice site Neil, Liverpool seems to like its drugs.
bB5d5YVeaa	I don't think you have to overdo it.    From a practical standpoint, just make sure there are no obstructions in the barrel...such as a leftover cleaning patch that might be obstructing the bore.    Also, make sure you didn't have any "leftover parts" after reassembly.  That's a clue that something is not right. ha ha    Lastly, be sure to lightly lubricate the moving parts of your firearm.  Again, don't overdo it.  But just like any mechnism, they work best when they are properly lubricated.|`|AA12034449	How many parts were left over after you put it back together?.    MN 91-30.... great little battle rifle. Now it was created in an era that had farmers and illiterate russian kids doing the fighting. Not to knock the Russians but back in the day everybodies army was farm kids and not real educated folks. All those rifles are the height of simplicity...even the later M1 and M16 can be maintained in the field by folks with very basic mechanical skills...Simple is what military small arms are all about.    If the bolt works... sets the trigger and the trigger drops the firing pin, and the safety works, you have done what amounts to a "function test" for a basic bolt action rifle.    From the question you are asking I wonder why you are bringing up headspacing? That requires guages to do it correctly... and unless you swapped bolts or reamed a chamber there is probably no need to check headspace. If your bolt is hard to turn on a standard round you may need to look at that.|`|SLy9xFwkaa	well hopfully you lubricated it while you had it disassembled and were carful not to over lubricate.  and if you assempled it incorrectly you will know i.e. trigger wont pull or is hard to pull, wont ****, wont chamber rounds. its pretty easy to tell if you haven't assembled a gun correctly. however mistakes can be made like dropping a spring and not noticing and such. i dont know your level of expertice with your firearm but if you feel confident in yourself then you proably did fine.|`|nqknrW7taa	Typically just make sure that the gun/guns have been put back together properly and that the action functions properly.|`|AA10102776	yer stressing me out|`|Y4RS35M7aa	If you didn't assemble the weapon correctly, it wouldn't cycle and dry-fire.  If it does, then you've done good.   Most weapons don't need more than field-stripping most of the time.  Just check that there is nothing in the bore (like Q-tips or cleaning patches) and don't over-oil the weapon.  You should not see oil standing on the metal.  Oil lubricates and protects at the microscopic level, so don't over-do it!  Just wipe excess oil off with a cloth, Q-tip, or...paper towel!  That's what I use!
GWz5KDTwaa	They are my favorite team.  And, they're getting better.................|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	Why?  I didn't root for the Sonics.|`|dffe0637ce0d1fb4a653af444962ca54aa	I have a personal bias against any team from Oklahoma (hook 'em horns!), but it does make me kind of sad when I see them lose badly...|`|LllekK48aa	Yes. I do. It's cause of Durant, Green, and Westbrook.|`|nTjAAvrOaa	As bad as I feel for the team, I want them to lose so bad because of what ownership did to the city of Seattle. (I'm a Midwest guy too)
p9RS2Wh6aa	Yellow Stone National Park area(its not in Mo. but it borders the state), or any where between Missoula & Darby.  Other place to check would be around Glacier National Park,  Dillon, Butte, Bozeman.
wKNcNWD3aa	hmm I'm not sure exactly but, I would say football has the most diverse physical changes during an entire game. Starting from full force, ending in shear exhaustion. Also positions played in the game from kicker, mild physical use, to say an middle linebacker, who will be at the peak of endurance the entire game. Hope that helps a little

There have been many very fast bowlers. in cricket for Australia Thomson, Miller, McDonald, Spofforth. The Windies had some real firebrands in Marshall, Roberts, Griffiths and Constantine. England had Snow, Tyson, Larwood, Truman.

SWkOC7rhaa	To be perfectly honest...    I'm not interested in those kind of games as I am from Europe and we have the hardest leagues in the world. EPL, La Lige and Serie A I'd watch and International teams like, England, Spain, Italy, France, Turkey, Netherlands and Nigeria I like to watch because they have attractive football, amazing talent and HISTORY!|`|mK06dus9aa	From the standpoint that I am 100% behind Mexico|`|5fwIsT9Baa	I never really thought about it but id say Mexico would hammer them ...it would be a game worth watching id say|`|efGx6z3vaa	We watch it because we have good Mexican players here except some trashy ones that destroy theselves(Dos Santos)|`|FFE9Qztzaa	I'm curious too about their opinion :)  Good Q.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	the game is like a derby game  ppl dont care    they think mexico beat the hell out o US |`|B7LyNQtBaa	Another game.Usa aren't that good a team but Mexico are a kinda okayish team.  I watch international soccer if there european teams such as Itay,France and Ireland.  But i'll probaly watch it.  Cause i like Usa and Mexico players.
xegK7yhiaa	most of us did not even know there was a rivalry. the thing is, what makeds rivalrys so great is the passion from the players and the fans of both countries. Italy vs France for example, has an incredible amount of passion from both the players and fans. now,  i believe the mexican players and fans both have passion for the sport, but the USA not. so, i do not believe it is a great rivalry.|`|TxVAXBpTaa	Who care!!! I don't .. It's not like Argentina vs Brazil...|`|iWOjZcbLaa	is it a rivalry???? if u want an answer to the question, it is that that game is not viewed as a rivalry, but just a game  if u want a motivation is for 2 principal reasons, soccer is not the best sport in both country (prob it is in mexico) so fans are surely less excited for a game, than the quality of the seasons or the teams in it... they sucks... so it is a normal game for us, to make u an example, do u think australia vs new zelan is a rivalry?? i dont think so, games like brasil vs argentina, france vs italy or italy vs germany prob france vs england too r seen as rivalry... prob bc they r the top teams too...|`|BdR6eQWOaa	I'm from Seattle, I'm looking forward to this one, I'm going to watch this one.

ZAh8CEoGaa	LeBron will win the MVP award. The DPOY award is possible but Howard is a clear lock at the moment for the award. But now that Nelson is out  and the Magic might start losing it may affect Howard. Chris Paul is also another candidate but he is also injure and his team's record is slowly going down. If LeBron can keep his defensive intensity and the Cavs still being the leagues best defensive team and have a great record at the end of the season then it may just go his way. KG won it that way last year.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Lebron is MVP, but DPOY he's is not. he improve alot on playing defence, he a very good hustle defender he gets alot of stealsand could make the 1st or 2nd all defensive team. Plus there are players who's more deserving of DPOY like Howard who is a rebound and shot block machine, and D-wade who is 3rd in steals and lead guards in blocks. Lebron is improving defensively every year this year he deserve to be on 1st and 2n all defence.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well LeBron has raised his defense to another level, that title belongs to Dwight Howard this year, his ability to control the paint and dominate the glass is unmatched in the NBA. LeBron will probably win the MVP if the Cavs keep their current pace on wins.|`|2wrenQfuaa	Simply No. His defense is overrated. He can't contain other players in key areas of the field.|`|HLzS2z9laa	its possible for lebron to win MVP and DPOY in the same season, but not this season, his d is not the best in the league yet, maybe one day he could win both but not now|`|5ANmjtLOaa	Lebron MVP Candidate, but DPOY? oh come on...don't believe what you watch in utube.

The most prominent is an Austin-Hulk Hogan match. It would be the perfect time for it with it being Wrestlemania 25 and all. I'm not a Hogan fan at all, but I would really like to see it.  Another that I've heard is Austin-Randy Orton. I wouldn't put too much stock in this one. It would be a cool match and it would have worked had they gone in a different direction, but WWE management has been pushing Orton way to hard for him not to be in a main event championship match at Wrestlemania. It would work with Orton's "Legend Killer" gimmick, but they haven't been doing that lately. I've also heard of the possibility of Austin teaming with Shane McMahon against the Legacy group, but that doesn't seem likely either.   I'd say that the most likely scenario is Austin-Hogan. Both have to be a part of Wrestlemania in some capacity. I mean, it's where they both made their names and they're the two biggest stars in professional wrestling history.|`|jUMffCiuaa	OKE, HERE IS DA ANSER 2 DAT KWISTYON OKE?

JYO3fN4haa	Not really! I was in the same situation a few years back. I went in to the bike shop and said look I never rode before what should I start off with. They pointed to the 250r and I bought it.     Well, I am 6'0 tall and was about 200 then. It is a very short bike and although it is kinda fast because its a ninja, its actually the slowest ninja I believe and you will get sick of it fast like I did probably. It just made me feel like I was riding something shitty also when riding with my other friends. I traded mine in right away and ended up losing money and going with a Honda 929.     Go with at least a 600cc at least you wont look like your riding the tricycle when your with your friends, and will be able to at least keep up. I think the 250 is not the proper size for someone of your height. Im wondering if they recommend it because youll be back to spend more money in the near future...    Hopefully you can use a 250r or something similar just for the course and the test so you can see for yourself and it will be easier, but when your all licensed up and have been riding for a couple of weeks youll be so sick of that 250 you will regret buying it.|`|MnsZifZFaa	I would go with something more along the 600cc     Today, a 250cc motorcycle is considered small, and a 600cc motorcycle mid-size. Even a liter bike (1000cc) is no longer considered "big" in a world of 1400-1800cc heavyweight motorcycles. I have read articles in the motorcycle press about the Yamaha V-Star 1100's, calling them "middleweight" cruisers!|`|Dm73FU8Baa	dude plain and simple 600 cc|`|RnjuNJ6faa	Basically they is afew good brand of bikes in the market. Ranges from Jap and Western Bikes.    Namely Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki for the Jap makers and Ducati, BMW and Harley.D from Western makers.    As i am from Asia, most Jap bikes is quite reliable with spareparts easily available and less costly to maintain.    As for Ducati, BMW is mostly for people with status and cost much more.    As for Harley....is mostly a symbol for the niche market. FREEDOM and FREE SPRITE and cost a boom.    If you are a newbie in bikes, try asking your course instructor instead. Personally, i would advice you to get a Jap pre-owned bike for a start. Try, ride and play with it for a year or 2. Gain some experiences and understand your own style of riding before investing too much at the start.|`|CCqqTw6paa	yeah its a good bike  should be fine for your learners and provisional|`|WluRS5ivaa	for your weight a 250 is really too small. It would be a good bike to learn on, but you will be sick of it and want to sell it about a month after you own it. Get a bigger bike and just take it easy for the first six months until you become a better rider.|`|0Di3c7m0aa	Based on experience a Ninja 250r would be a good bike for a beginner but the problem with it is that you will get tired of it very quickly.  You don't want to purchase a bike that you will regret buying a couple months later.  If you are looking for a street bike you should check out bikes in the 600 - 750cc range.  Hope this helps.

I think still two or three yrs of cricket left in him. See jayasurya. But don't ask him for a attacking normal way of cricket. he is now the senior most Pro. So he will be supporting the batsmen at the other end. But once he gets going no one can stop him. He single handedly won the two finals of CB Series. remember. I feel he should be there still WC and get the WC for India in 2011. This is because not that is fame for Sachin.

zh19SFMsaa	no way, you can still start again.  just because you older doesn't mean there aren't opportunitys.  you may be too old to start competitions, but there are so many other things you could do, if you get good again, then you can audition for ice shows, and posibly get hired by a company.    also, geting teaching qualifications are also very popular, you could become a coach.    go for it !! :)  if you really love it, you can acheive anything.|`|bvnzv923aa	Since you got good when you were younger, that would make it better if you were to go back. Although, I have to say, every skater reaches a point where it becomes incredibly difficult to further advance if skating. (When you are a young adult....around 20ish...) That's why most people you see on tv are pretty much a maximum of 26ish years old. It just gets harder. But, since you did skate before, it would be fine to go back, just as long as you havent completely lost all of your skating ability.|`|uvqjqlejaa	I guess it's definately better to start off young but as you have had experience i think you will be fine. The main thing is if you enjoy it !! I've been skating since i was 5 (I'm now 16) and i would never give it up for the world!! If you also felt like this and have have felt that something has been missing from your life, please take it back up again.  I hope this post helps you and i wish you luck for the future.     xx|`|0Di3c7m0aa	You should do what makes you happy.  I think you should start skating again.|`|zJHrFBtNaa	It is never too late so just start again and see what happens. If you were really good, then perhaps you can get what you want.  Good Luck :)|`|tiZbUFmEaa	Of course not.  Where I skate, there's many adults also skating for enjoyment and exercise.    Skating will be a great thing for you, I can tell.|`|if6zwEopaa	It's never too late to do anything. It is natural that you aren't that good in it anymore. I mean, I was 7 last time I played tennis. I began doing it again because I love it! I can tell you that I am starting to be the same. Don't let anything stop you! You only have 1 life to live. So do everything you want to do before you regret not doing it!  Have fun skating!|`|ORmVmQRdaa	I had a half hour ice skating today, my first time on the ice and I'm 46.    There were pensioners ice dancing and looking great so it's never too late and at 18  you are just a baby.    Go for it.    Today I went from frozen in fear to doing a circuit and managing to stop thanks to a bit of instruction. I'm hooked.|`|VJThueYyaa	NO!!!! you are not too old, if it makes you happy and you love it do it you will pick it all up again once you start so just go for it.
MuLaZcS2aa	Cuz whoever created fotball over here was too lazy to create a new name and too retarded to realize he plays the game with his hands. For all you idiots who use the "we already have a sport called football so it'd be confusing" American football was created from real football.|`|lEPcXjkgaa	I would say because soccer (football) is bigger in areas like europe but America have the NFL which is bigger in america|`|AA11979213	We already have our version of football.  Where big guys put on pads and a helmet and knock each other around for a oval shaped ball made out of pigskin.  It's exciting, especially college football (GO TEXAS!)  So we had to call soccer, soccer as to not get it confused with the rest of the worlds "football".    Actually, I don't know why we call it soccer, we just do.  Why don't we use the metric system?  Why do we use Farenheit instead of Celsius?  These are all good questions, and none that I have the answer to.|`|wKnjGSU1aa	"Why is soccer known as football in Europe?" Haha, learn which came first, then speak. The U.S. sport is not Football. The one played around the world is.|`|o7gV56ngaa	Because we failed to educate our colonies properly.|`|1j60dOgOaa	Because we already have a different sport called football|`|kELOzS8Faa	Why is soccer known as football in Europe?    It works both ways...    Besides, America already has a sport called football. Having two sports with the same name would be confusing.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	It is not just in the USA that they call it Soccer.  There are a few reasons for this. But to cut it short. SOCCER SUCKS.
XAv3og6raa	what system are you playing it on?
65t5ie9Kaa	What area are you from? These are the following teams when i use to play under 19s.    Berwick miners ( endevour hills )  Southern seahawks ( frankston )  Nudawadding   Geelong  Western crusaders ( footscray i think )   Croyden rangers ( croyden )    i believe there might be one more team but i cant remember if they still have a under 19s team.

I don't like and haven't for ages.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I didn't really pay attention to her crack, lol, but she's gained some weight recently. That may be the reason|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Yeah, it really annoys me. Not only with Candice, but for all of the other women wrestlers out there. Whatever they wear is over the top. Please, wear something decent for once!|`|h2gZKIVnaa	um yeah it does sorta bug me but, am used to it anyway most female wrestlers are half naked anyway its like a law|`|QGSspL8aaa	-_- who cares
5GRtHQpwaa	I think it was absolute stupidity and I can't for the life of me think how it has benefitted Liverpool.    Keane is a proven striker at Premiership level and a damn good one at that. Liverpool are way way short on strikers and I'm pretty sure that there will be something come out soon about Torres and his Hamstring - I think he needs a MASSIVE lay-off, but Liverpool keep patching him up as they need him.    Keane is needed by Liverpool now. Ngog isn't ready, Kuyt is nowhere near good enough and to come out with comments that 'Babel and Benayoun can also play up front' is laughable. With Gerrard now injured, where are the goals going to come from? Selling Keane and bringing no-one in is one of the most baffling things i've seen in years.|`|TcxikWoAaa	no the club suffered a loss n jus after 6 months out of his 4 year contract now common sense tells me tat it was not worth it or necessary at all, Keane can act as a back up to Torres bcuz he might tire easily as he jus came back 2 football, so it was definitely unnecessary|`|xywgBurHaa	The problem at Liverpool is that they have a Manager that can't do his Job. .. It is up to the Manager to get the best out of his players and Benitez failed miserably in the case of Keane. .. Any Manager who can't get the best out of a quality player like Keane, ain't worth his salt nor pay packet !!    I don't know with who your faith lies Dear Asker with regard to which team you may support but in my opinion any more silly behaviour by benitez and Gerrard and the like will be down the road, before they die of embarrassment !!
GswnLKtQaa	that's sad i thought she had 1-2 years left, she's the reigning defensive player of the year.    lisa will be miss, she had a great career. 2 championships and 4 olympic gold medals.    I will still root for the Sparks because we still got Candice MVP+ROY!    CP3 back to back MVP!|`|4DcvpQXfaa	yes,it's big blow for WNBA    but candace is the new WNBA star!    "the show must go on"|`|kFcdwVwdaa	candace is the new "leslie". they picked her for her game and to replace lisa. they knew she was going to be leaving soon. candace can learn from lisa a little bit more and she will do her thing as she grows in the game.  thanks for the games lisa|`|ClQ9yJweaa	Will be sad to see Leslie retire, for I been a fan of hers and the womens game. However, despite getting a bit older, she now has a family to raise, and priorities within the home come first. Good for her though. She had a stellar career, and no doubt is a future HOF.   Wow, didnt know candace was pregnant. Is it a LA thing? LOL. Well she will be missed in the line up for sure, but Sparks can still do damage, but opens the door for other teams now also.
D6Llh23Baa	playing the run and gun offense affects badly the players' stamina. that's why not too much energy is placed on the defensive end. you're right, playing that kind of an offense is a very big gamble, because in order to start the fast break, you have to risk intercepting the ball when it is being passed or even when the point guard is still dribbling. good defense should also be anchored by a defensive inside presence. and usually, those who are pretty good post defenders don't usually run that much.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Yeah it is a big gamble.  But it worked for the Phoenix Suns for how many years?|`|H8FHx1HYaa	for me the run and gun play is a big gamble,|`|sCiuv7n3aa	No...... your defense is only LUCK... the opponents missing the ball...|`|kFcdwVwdaa	it never worked for the suns under dantoni system, they have no championships.   just play your defense first and if you get a turnover off the races you guys go.but make sure you guys play defense and shoot your 3s
mK06dus9aa	For F's sake that's hidious - I do quite like the "away" but I hate the colour of the home and shape of them all.|`|PBBkky3Faa	The 3rd kit, to me, looks alright. BUT they ALL look like a cheep training top, especially with the zip.|`|IOKilPsFaa	the home kit is so ugly.....  away kit is ok....  and the 3rd kit looks like inter's... trying get 'the special one' back  maybe?|`|c4GykfVkaa	I like the third one. not the others. Are you sure  that they will be tight fitting? I hope they won't have those stripes on the shoulders(I hated them)|`|DZ24AAkiaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    liverpools new shirt is going to be like that then (maybe)|`|tfotPdeZaa	ha ha mrs. roman abrahmovich. =p lol.  you are right the shirts do look bad but u cant always trust the picture. they might actually look good on the players.|`|BdR6eQWOaa	HA HA HA!!!  I wouldn't buy any of them either Amie.  Those kits are absolutly ugly.  Even if they weren't, I still wouldn't buy them because I'm an American Gooner not an American Glory Hunter.|`|5YKMYcxWaa	the white one is nice =]|`|JHAqEETmaa	It could be worst.  For ex. the hysteric yellow of Barcelona or the annoying blue of Man Utd.|`|efGx6z3vaa	Well You Fans are Ugly Glory Hunters so you derserve that shirt|`|14C07eygaa	Get over it, it's not a fashion contest.|`|YuAndWj6aa	ewwwwwww......  I think they should just stick to conventional jerseys...  And besides, its gonna be difficult to get a jersey your cut if they do it so tight...  Gonna be hard to mass sell...  Who's idea is this anyway? Scolari or Roman?|`|1VJkCsSNaa	no they rn't that bad   players will look like superheroes in them   CHELSEA SUPERHEREOS|`|YETEt0Dqaa	well it dont matter what they wear cos there **** anyway|`|BA1TOMr9aa	There not Chelsea's next years jersey's, they just got there one they wear now about 12 months ago.|`|p8lB73rdaa	They look like cycling jerseys , a trend started in Italy .      Amie , Kevin has proven himself time and again to be a prize Twat so I wouldn't worry about him !|`|uXXbegw5aa	Hahaha, sexy ;)|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	roman might be seeing a lot of neutrals discarding the shirt and a lot of fans as well as bad as sacking grant/mourinho|`|OYYYNCyCaa	looks like they have been designed by George Costanza (Seinfeld)|`|IXDiEX8eaa	They are just too uncomfortable to wear and the away kit is even more uglier.|`|HxET88bDaa	Haha....hey they're not bad actually (the idea, not the design:P)    Rugby started using the idea and i guess it was inevitable that football would follow suit. I think they are used to avoid shirt pulling etc, and it might be good for football...i imagine if the Chelsea ones are good then most clubs will go ahead with their own designs. As for the kits for fans i think they would do two types...so don't worry:)
dCbIHBpGaa	It looks like mission impossible but then again there have been some great escapes down there before...ask Brighton fans... so anything is possible!|`|Sooy4byaaa	No (poor buggers!!)|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Nope. They are too far behind: Ten points behind Bournemouth and 19 back of Grimsby.|`|1iSXOnZ5aa	They have a very little chance to survive.
KHUEkyNaaa	Troy Polamalu is more well-rounded plus look at that hair!!!|`|ULw1777caa	Polamalu by far.|`|AA12103453	I could go homer and say Troy. On the other hand look how much better the Colts were in the playoffs two years ago when Sanders finally came back. So to be honest it's a bit of a toss-up to me. I pick Troy because I'm a Steelers fan, but have a lot of respect for Sanders.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Troy Polamalu hands down.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Polamalu, better all around safety who will play through injuries... Sanders seems to be a lock to miss 4 games a season nowadays.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	I think Sanders is a better pick just because of what he does when he does play. Lots of people are saying Polumolu right now just because of what the steelers have done. THink about it tho, Snaders wasnt in the top d unit this year like polumolu was. Troy had guys around him that were making playsjust as often as he was. Sanders didnt have that this year or any year, thats why hes so banged up.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Polamalu over Sanders... I have to admit I'm not a big fan of the hair, but the guy can flat out play.     I'd take Reed over Sanders as well... and Reed over Polamalu...|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	Polamalu - all round game just trumps Sanders. Better hair too.|`|Y1RP2nlyaa	If Sanders could stay healthy it would be a good comparison.|`|786QN5Aeaa	Polamalu, because he plays in most of his games, I can't remember when sanders hasn't been fighting an injury|`|AA11373201	Bob Sanders it is the most overrated player in nfl|`|kcZZaNi2aa	I would rather have Troy Polamalu because he is a more proven player and is more aggresive plus he also makes bigger plays in big situations.|`|op4fEbEVaa	They're both great but Sanders is better|`|tVEm2eJXaa	I would rather have Troy Polamalu because Bob Sanders had 1 interception all year long and Polamalu had 7, not including Polamalu's 40 yard interception returned for a touchdown in the AFC Championship.|`|2yNKoaiNaa	Good question...one that seems to come up a lot in debates.  In terms of market value, you can argue that Sanders takes the cake - he's the highest paid safety in the NFL ($37 mill. over 5 years).      Personally, I'd rather have Polamalu right now.  Ask me two years ago, and I'd have to take Sanders - he led that Colts team to the Super Bowl on the defensive end.  You can argue stats all you want, but I think a main issue is durability....Troy has played in 88 games since 2003.  Sanders has been in the league one year less and played half as many (45).  Polamalu's key stats are double what Sanders has - picks, tackles, etc.    Just my opinion.|`|XgauQLqRaa	Sanders
KjEVO85Taa	Wow difficult question but i would go with 1Cahill, 2Agbonlahor 3Zaki 4Defoe 5Davies|`|GZ4ix77Saa	In no particular order    Gabriel Agbonlahor  Amr Zaki  Michael Owen (he's good when he's fit)  Roque Santa Cruz  Tim Cahill (technically a midfielder but he's still good in striker positions)|`|YqEPE90raa	Agbonlahor, Carew, Zaki, heskey, Carlton Cole|`|At9zfB1Jaa	Agbonlahor  Yakubu  Robinho  Cahill  Young|`|hpfEO0I3aa	robinho  heskey  zaki|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	1.

lPDHMOVZaa	Tony Gonzalez... Antonio has a lot to accomplish before he is on the same scale as Tony career wise...   ---  Steven Jackson... Jackson is a more complete back and, in my opinion, is more likely to break the big play. Jackson also plays for a worse team which makes his stat line that much more impressive.   ---  Philip Rivers... Rivers puts up equal, if not better, numbers than Romo on a yearly basis. He does it with a slightly worse receiving corps and a nearly equal tight end. The difference is that Rivers has won a playoff game.   ---  Ed Reed... Dawkins was a beast in his day... but that day is gone now. Reed trumps Dawkins in every skill required to be a dominant safety in the NFL... speed, coverage, hands and the ability to deliver a bone crushing hit.   ---  Patrick Willis... a bit of 49ers bias here... but there is a reason the guy has made the pro-bowl in his first two seasons as a pro. Willis is the unquestioned leader of the 49ers defense and without him the unit would be no where close to where they are today. While Beason is a beast in Carolina, there are other guys on that unit that have pro-bowl qualities... i.e. Julius Peppers.|`|tNerdFYsaa	Tony Gonzalez-Always solid even when his team goes through 3 QB's in one year  Clinton Portis-although they both get injured frequently, Portis almost all the time has a solid year  Rivers-He has barely any weapons and takes more hits than anyone in the game, yet still dominates 34 Td's 11 ints  Reed-the guy is a genius, finds the ball and finds a way to have it. He even hides behind the refferee and comes out to pick it off, like he did against Miami  Willis-He's on a crappy team with no one around him, but still can shine|`|un67D8QTaa	tony hes got better experience  clinton hes faster and stronger  romo cause hes got heart but is over rated and very fast  dawkins hes stronger  willis cuz hes got heart and has better experience|`|F6OnzUW3aa	Tony Gonzalez -- best tight end (just needs a better team)    2. Clinton Portis- Ezy     Philip Rivers--Led NFL in QB Rating     Brian Dawkins--Ed reed is only good in int's Dawkins can atleast tackle.    5. Patrick Willis or Jon Beason   -patirck wilis? i don't know these guys|`|603wBW5zaa	Gonzalez- is actually the best receiver on his team, and is a total player.    Portis- Jackson is WAY overrated and gets injured too much    Rivers- no explanation needed... look at the stats. Romo is a press boy crybaby.    Dawkins- can actually tackle    Beason by FAR!!!!!! the panther's ypc on defense would be around 9 without him, he does more for his team and is a total beast in the zone.|`|vQeKxmZyaa	My answers will be based on "when it's all said and done" and not "at this point in time".    1. Tony Gonzalez--best receiving TE to play the game.  2. Clinton Portis--Jackson is stuck on a Rams team that's only good once or twice a decade  4. Phillip Rivers--Romo's a hack on a hack team  3. Ed Reed--Although I love Dawkins and he's the heart of the Philly franchise I have to go with Reed because he's the bigger playmaker.  He personally influences the outcomes of at least 3-4 games a season.  5. Jon Beason--We have to play him twice a year and he's a beast.  I've only watched Willis a couple of times and he seems overrated.  Good player but I saw nothing worthy of being All Pro.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	Antonio Gates - I think that receiving they are alike, but blocking the edge goes to Gates    Jackson - Portis may have better stats, but I think that if SJ had a better O Line, he would rack up stats like Portis.  Plus, I think Jackson has better hands.    Toss up - Romo is a good QB until the latter portion of the season.  Plus Romo has the better WR group.  Rivers has LT to take pressure off him, as the Def has to key on LT as a game changer.  Both are still young, and have their best years ahead of them.    Reed - They are both good shut down defense players, but Reed has the extra advantage of always being able to take picks to the house.  He has better vision IMO.    Willis - He is a young player and is already making major impact on the league.  Willis is always in the right place at the right time.|`|rvl2f6ERaa	gonzalez  portis  romo  reed  willis|`|KNTofuxMaa	Gonzalez.. best TE ever  Portis... When healthy, he is a beast.  Romo... yeah I'm biased. So? The guy is a good QB.  Reed... One of the best safeties, EVER.  Willis... SEC guy and he won the Butkus award and won Rookie of the year. Guess who was second? yep, Beason.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Gonzalez-body of work  Portis- more good years  Rivers- better future-tuff stuff  Reed- knack for the ball, big plays  Willis|`|4S6V4sb4aa	I think they are all over payed, exspecialy with the way the economy is today with families being kicked into the street due to they can't afford to live in America,, Nobody should be payed that much to ""PLAY"" a game.. Those families are better,, at least they really work, and really deserve what ever they can get..|`|8wmjYlfaaa	Gonzalez-has the most receptions and TD's in the NFL.  Jackson-he's on a worse team, but he's better  Philip Rivers-waaay more consistent  Ed Reed-no comparioson  Patrick Willis.

tdG6NkEJaa	Haven't seen a spear tackle in ages. Good rule, but not needed atm. I guess it's better than having one spear tackle and then the AFL having a stupid knee jerk reaction. Didn't Hodge have to go to the Tribrunal last year for umpire abuse, because he touched him or some bullshit.|`|mXFOru11aa	WTF is this ******* netball what happened to the good old days where umpires weren't gay and would cop a beating rugby supporters are sitting there luaghing at us cos it is turning into a soft game|`|2s244jGgaa	Leave the rules alone.    Although i must say, it would make the game safer.   Players shouldnt groan, the umpires dont hate them, they get paid to tell players what to do and control the game and when the umpire says something they should just shut up and stick with it.|`|Gj8JTJGRaa	i`ll look into this|`|YcvKwRqiaa	Great.  It's good to see them dealing with the important issues. We musn't forget about the poor umpires. Maybe they should tweak the rules a bit more so that the players can't give the umps dirty looks either?|`|4wRyTY9Raa	When are umpires going to get it into their skulls the game is about the players, we don't go to the footy to see the umpires in action, they are a protected species already, you can't criticise them in any way or else you get a 'please explain',  fair dinkum they need to take a step back and realise things get said in the heat of battle.|`|PNnwHp7gaa	Do all the umpires come out of the same mold? If so I wish they'd add something to the ingredients that stiffened their backbone a bit.    Do they all have a chip on their shoulder at birth? Do they all have fragile egos?    Maybe we should do away with the players & just let the umpires run around on the oval - by themselves. They could all dress up in their canary yellow, kumquat orange & robin red-breast red outfit - blowing their whistles to their hearts' content.    They think that spectators go to the ground just to watch them, don't they?    Then they wouldn't have to waste so much time at tribunal hearings because of this dastardly crime of "umpire abuse".
OfNTLq3Qaa	Because normal fans are supposed to. You're what I call a heel mark, I know because I am one myself. I prefer most heels over face wrestlers. At live events some people get as mad at me as they do the heels, like I care.|`|B9h6VhQOaa	idk but i would love to see just 1 show where most fans are cheering for the heels. it would be funny.|`|IrwnQD2maa	You would help the wrestling business by playing along with the storyline. It's traditional to praise the good-guy and despise the the bad guy. It's good vs evil. The wrestling business thrives on these fan reactions, and ignorant fans like yourself are what's wrong in today's wrestling world.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Umm, because heels are heels for a reason. That has nothing to do with the person's wrestling ability. Randy Orton is one of my favorite wrestlers, but if I was in the arena I'd boo him too|`|DJThkWRTaa	I cheer for the Lions even though they suck because they are my favorite!|`|2KBN2lCUaa	That is how it is suppose to be. Fans have to boo heels and cheer faces|`|H5EYUh69aa	Mostly 'entertainment fans' cheer or boo ... They like to be wrapped up in the action instead of taking in how the wrestlers are working everyone around them so therefore those fans will just go with the flow and not realize how 'worked' the wrestlers are 'working' them.    All I really got in answer to you is, they are doing a great job playing their 'heel' and 'face' roles.    Although some heels do get cheered, I hear some pops for a lot of the heels.|`|7BS1L0oBaa	because they do when i went to wwe event where i was sitting nearly everyone was booing Miz and Morrison where as i was cheering for them|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Because there supposed to be booed.  Jericho and Orton have said in interviews that if people cheer them as heels then they feel they haven't done there job properly.  CM Punk isn't lame... your mum is lame.  And how is it annoying for people to express opinions.|`|ZLGr6pX3aa	They do it cause it's the way the show goes all the kids boo the baddy they don't look at their wrestling ability i was the same when i was young now when you get older you change your opinion|`|B8cf1k5Oaa	Because Like Regualr Fans Only Like Face's Espically Little Kids But Honestly I lIke Heels More Than Anything Such As Randy And Jack Swagger Cause Heels Carry Them Self's Well And They Can Do Something And Get Away With It Faces On The Other Hand Are Expected To Make Us Enjoy And Do The Right Thing And Like They Always Winning Ergo Fans Cheer For Them|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	i don't get that. everyone on here(including me) loves most of the big heels and think the big faces are annoying, but everyone that goes to the shows are the other way|`|vwoqIUR6aa	i don't know but I love randy
zFB8PKjuaa	yeah he killed his wife and kid and himself...  but i think what he did for the wwe, wwf, wcw and ecw was somewhat  amazing.... he was the best technical wrestler to ever walk the earth...  what he did OUTSIDE WWE is plain wrong but wwe wouldnt be around if it wasnt for people like benoit.....|`|89TgOjXpaa	Because he killed his wife and kid, then himself. and WWE has said he will never be inducted to the WWE hall of fame, its sad really cause he was a great wrestler but he suffered from a illness that impacted his judgment to what he has done. he should have got help before the tradgeredy happened.|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Because he is a double murderer, even going as far as taking his son's life:(     That is the reason why he has Not been put in the hall of fame, because he let WWE down.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	He isn't in the HOF because the killed his wife and youngest son.The wee would not induct some one who did those things regardless of his wrestling career.The media would tear them apart.They are really erasing his career from history because of what he has done.That's what his family wanted them to do so the wwe did it.Besides if they would acknowledge Benoit the media would tear McMahon apart.There was already enough controversy and blame being set on Vince McMahon and professional wrestling all together after the murder.McMahon isn't stupid he wouldn't set him self up for attacks by the media by putting Chris Benoit in the HOF.Benoit won't be in the HOF never mind his accomplishment in wrestling because of what he has done.They would not set them self up for the media and the public attacks and complains.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Because he killed his wife and kids, then himself.

It's all storyline... Benoit is returning at Wrestlemania to challenge Hulk Hogan for the world title of Japan.    God... you gotta love the two points.|`|PANwlcLJaa	There are two reasons he will not be inducted: reason 1:No one is around to sign a legends contract in order to be in the Hall of Fame.  Reason2: Because he killed his wife son then himself and now that WWE went TV-PG that would not be role model material.
xnhBucrjaa	actually they don't rehearse  anything. they are told how long the match has to be and what to finish the match with that's all.|`|FsnxfhEuaa	Not always, Sometimes but because some of wrestling is fake, They make those wrestlers that will win do something that doesn't look like it'll hurt them. So it's pretty much Predictable.|`|H5EYUh69aa	My guess is that the performers in the match would go over it sometime before the show.    With these matches, they need to know who's eliminating who, who's eliminated first, eliminating first, Who is first and who's last, who's between etc it goes on and on what they have to consider.    SO .. I would think they go over it and plan different spots of the match, The outcome of course.    Hell in a cell matches would be a lot different I would think because it usually consists of two people or a tag team so I would say that's just a shoot, Like any other (non elimination) match.    Apart from the climax of the match, which obviously the performers go over to make sure it's done to perfection so they get that reaction they want from the crowd.    And also any risky, dangerous spots during the match would have to be gone over before the show to make sure any injury chances are decreased.|`|DJThkWRTaa	They would have to because it is all choreographed so they rehearse like a theatre performance or a dance recital|`|5XW8T1d1aa	Most definatly,  That is why most pay per views stand out.

d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	There are too many pointless ODI series, the IPL is an unnecessary domestic tournament and utterly meaningless cash-cows called the Champions Trophy and the Stanford thingy clog up the only free spaces in the calendar. There is a simple moral: stop chasing money and start chasing cricketing excellence!    More tests, more first class cricket and less slogs-for-morons would uncomplicate the situation.|`|Mfi84xBQaa	YA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Especially this year ...................................|`|M8XmhqIhaa	Yep its a really tough job at the moment. But they're not getting all that money for no reason! They need to earn it, as its their duty to entertain the fans. The cricketers don't have to participate in the IPL if they feel they get tired. But they're professional athletes and they know what they're doing.    Also, after retirement, they won't really have to do anything. They'll get to sleep in as much as they want and they'll have so much endless time to spend with families.|`|AA11088802	too much cricket|`|kecdkv6jaa	Add IPL and ocassionally the world cup and other special events in there as well!!    Well it is their full time job, and they are expected to play a lot to entertain and earn their money. Although that much activity at such a high intensity is both physically and mentally demanding to them, not to mention not spending much time with their family.    II don't think they playy "too" much their schedule (escpecially Australia's) is not spread out enough and they are made to play non stop for months... the ICC could spread games out a bit, playing the same amount of cricket each year but it will have less toll on the body|`|wz8gx3gaaa	I don't think so.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	There is too much cricket but what can you do. The players complain and what do they do? Sign up for IPL or County cricket and then, Like Ponting, take time away from playing for Australia.    I remember in the "good old days" when I could go and watch a Shield game in Sydney and the test players were playing.|`|gfxXikenaa	Yes i agree with you too much cricket is played and cricketers in result get drained of energy and cant play with their full effectiveness~|`|dJcPxDBUaa	Yep... i totally agree with u....

Hawes will be good if Miller gets traded...McDyess is great for rebounds.  Perkins is playing well lately.  Thomas has been great lately, but with Gooden coming back, I'm not sure he sustains it..maybe he does.  Daniels isn't so great now that Dunleavy is back.  Mason the same as Manu is back.  Rudy will get you 3s and stls...Elson and Gadzuric will likely time share..I'd probably go with McDyess, Perkins, or Thomas...but I bet you end up dropping them at some point...if this it h2h you may want to consider streaming...that is adding and dropping someone nearly every day to meet your teams needs based on matchups...if roto, it depends on if you need blocks or not.  thomas is the man if you need blocks.|`|EX8FOnVpaa	drop bogut and pick up perkins or Gadzuric or Spencer
SWxnbKyyaa	I like the first,seventh,fifth and fourth    I'm just trying something of my own, IDK whether that would be funny,please do bear with me if it isnt funny    1.A bowler asked a coach, "Can you reverse swing a new ball"    Coach " Well, who said you cannot,you can swing any type of cricket ball.All you need is a slippery hand and the ball automatically goes in the opposite direction"    Bowler "thanks, now I got it"    Edit 1.  Yeah I got another one  2.A  cricketer  became very famous and popular for his contributions towards the game.From the day he got famous his electricity bill had gone down drastically, guess why?.........    Because his house always get flooded by his fans that he dint have to use the one on the ceiling!!!!!    Then this one  3.Out of the following whom would you choose to guard your house after 9 pm?  1.Sehwag  2.Sachin  3.Ishant  4.Dravid  5.Laxman      Answer is simple, its Ishant because amongst them only he can be the night watchman!!!!    Edit 2  Fourth one  Why does the Indian dressing room have no walls?  That's simple, because we have Dravid(The Wall)    Okay Answer this one--- this is regarding our cricket section  The user Bingalee is a distant relative of Sourav Ganguly,why?    B'coz its in her name, "BingaLee" = "BengaLi" = "bengali"  and Sourav is a Bengali  (Bengali is used to refer a person who is native from West Bengal)    This is all I could do on my own      Edit :3   I think Rixie(Asterix) can come up with stuff better than this, pity that he isnt  here now    Edit 4:   I have one more(ofcourse this is said by someone else and not my own one,I just felt like sharing it with you)  As a matter of fact most of us would be knowing that Inzamam is poor in English and he makes it up by saying "All credit goes to our boys" for any question asked in presentation    He was asked this question: "Its a good news to hear that your wife is going to give birth to your second child"   His response was " All credit goes to our boys for their performance"    (The credit may very well go to his boys but I don't take the credit for this one though since it was said by somebody else,LMAO)    Edit:5   LMAO Binga, Rixie was saying to me today that nowadays the cricket section has become the biggest joke!!!!!!

o1fgTGzzaa	I think the mystery surrounding the stig character is what makes it interesting, finding out who it is would just spoil it!!!|`|74OjrgGdaa	Sounds reasonable, but I believe he is a well known racer. If his identity was known there would be more focus on him than the car. Other drivers would be making challenges to get better times and the focus would be lost. Good theory though!|`|939307a82ae025e53a21c0a641378b87aa	I always assumed that he was suppose to be Stig Blomquist but they never actually got Stig to do the show.  Or maybe they did once or twice. But not consistently enough.  The physique of The Stig is nothing like Biologists. So I doubt its him which keeps it fun.|`|xkWLcv62aa	I have to say I would prefer not to knowing who the Stig was :P
mTXHW3lzaa	That is a good plan if winning is your only goal, but you can never rely on how the competition will run, the only one you can rely on is yourself. However, kickers win races but dont set records. The best way I find to run an 800m is to take it our real hard from the start and break the legs of the kickers and thin out the pack early to avoid trouble, then take it back a slight bit at the 500m mark, then blast the last 200m. In the words of the late Steve Prefontaine, "If you set the pace, you control the race"|`|xGLyp2TOaa	I was typically an even split guy, I would run 60-58, 60-59, 60-60, 59-59 when I ran.  Most people go out too fast in an 800 so by maintaining my pace and letting those people go ahead for the first 500 it allowed for me to just go right by them the last 300 meters of the race.|`|eDCyle05aa	That sounds like a great strategy, but you have to know your competition because if that guy in front of you is faster you might not be able to overtake him at the end (wind resistance is not a big factor). I made that mistake at the state championships last year and lost by 2/100 of a second. If you know you are faster than him that strategy will definitely work, but if he is faster than you, you need to put as much distance between him as you can so he can't catch you.|`|KVVvKHsAaa	RUN O_O|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	Do it on your own, you'll be sure to win.|`|Jj8JlApvaa	Simple'  get a double, and on the slow corner' let him replace you.|`|IITnJjAjaa	That sounds like a pretty good plan- just play to your strengths.  Good luck, i hope you win. (:|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	The 800 is a pretty short race.  You only have time to make one move.  If you make your move and the other guy is able to counter it, you probably aren't going to have the time or energy to make another one.  So make your move count    I found it best to go with the pack for the first 200 because some people tend to go out too fast.  Then, on that curve, I would position myself and make my move as we hit the straightaway.  Usually, everyone was nice and lined up single file to take the curve, so passing was pretty easy.  From there, it was just a matter of me running the last lap as hard as possible and not getting caught.  I would try to put enough distance on the pack that anyone with a kick would have too much ground to make up.    As a note, the 800 is really too short of a race to have much of a "kick".  Generally, if a guy has a good 800 kick, he is not running the first 400 hard enough and leaving time on the track.  I would usually aim to split within 1.5 secs of each lap.    Also, I think you overestimate the wind drag.  Unless it is an very windy day, it doesn't make much difference.|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	last year i had to plan how i was going to win my 800m race. i planned to as like you run behind the first person and than make my move the last 100m.    Things i had to consider - would i be able to keep up with the leaders pace    if i cant keep up with their pace would i loose my confidence    will i be able to make a move at the end    anyway in the end i ignored all that and used my natural instinct and ran from the begining leading the whole thing with a distance of 200m from the secound runner      what run is it? is it a real run or a school thing

0Dm3WEMcaa	I would say watch a TNA PPV, i have problems with impact myself, Vince Russo is destroying the company in my eyes, but at the PPV's they are mostly about the wrestling which is the main argument to watch TNA, i watch impact to keep up with the general story's for PPV's if im honest because of the Russo factor. Neither TNA or WWE are putting on a perfect wrestling show but TNA lets the wrestlers wrestle. John Cena can actually wrestle but is limited by the WWE like nearly all there stars.     So like i said both have problems but why not watch both? TNA does have a cheesy factor. Curry Man is actually huge in Japan and was very entertaining but he has left. Rock and rave infection have broken up and i haven't seen Sharkboy for a long time. so you haven't watched in a while but that's your choice.    If you really want to see what TNA wrestling is about i say watch Alex Shelley vs. Chris Sabin at Genesis, one of the best matches i have seen. You accept with the WWE's problems, yes the do have some as well, but you dismiss TNA for having problems as well? See that's why some people get annoyed by this, your dismissing the new guy and staying loyal for what reason? TNA isn't awful (yet will be if they don't fire Russo) so is there really a problem with watching both? Watch a TNA PPV is what i would tell a WWE fan because TNA normally delivers at PPV's|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	tna is realizing the bad gimmick flaws that you pointed out and giving them little to no air time while wwe is completely oblivious of their dumb gimmicks|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I'm a WWE fan and TNA themselves have not given me a reason to "cross the line".    About the best someone could do is say "It's different, so watch it."    I keep hearing people say what great talent TNA has. What's the point of that talent if you don't use it? That's like being the smartest kid in school, but you never do your work. We know what your potential is, but you'd still get an F.    Stupid storylines? Talk about how TNA has a character from their video game running around. Talk about how washed up has-beens are running the show. Sure WWE has some stupid storylines here and there, but WWE has cushion, they have room to fail because they are established already. Every mistake TNA makes is a costly one    I got a great slogan to get someone to watch TNA: "Come see your once favorite superstars from the last few decades break down and fall apart. Dudleys, Sting, Nash, Steiner, the best of the best (if this was 15 years ago)"|`|Gj8JTJGRaa	Whats the diffrence between tna and wwe?|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Quit letting Vince make choices for you. They have this guy AJ Styles who is better than most of the WWE roster. There are less dumb storylines, although some will debate that.   I would ask what is the harm in watching once? Are you afraid you might find out that you've been duped by Vince all these years?    Typical, If you think that WWE puts on a better show then you need help. Being the oldest out of the two does not make it the best. In fact RoH is better than both.   The WWE is so stuck on themselves, 70% of their superstars blow spots during every match. The last two Raws were so sloppy, I have seen better wrestling at Indy shows.    If I wanted storylines I'd watch a Soap, most fans watch to see wrestling. Why do you think the WWE ratings and fan support has fallen in recent years? It's because of ignorant storylines that take time away from wrestling. TNA is also guilty of this at times.    Oh, you have valid points. I'm not saying that all story lines are a waste of time but take Hornswaggle. I mean come on, it was funny for a couple of shows but got old quickly. Take Shane taking out Legacy. You have a non-wrestler taking out your Royal Rumble winner and two other superstars at once. That was a joke. These are the issues I have with the WWE, have storylines that people can believe.|`|6LQNK51uaa	I ll tell him "there is a hard way and there is an easy way Brother..Watcha gonna choose..if u say no than all this TNAmaniac is gonna running wild on you"      I think I can only suggest them to watch the clips of matches between Angle/Joe,Daniels/AJ and AJ/Joe before commenting anything stupid like TNA sucks|`|YTLlMdhDaa	1)I would tell them to simply watch an 8 man Ultimate X match for the X-Division title and you will be entertained more during that one match than you would an ENTIRE episode of Raw. You would also see moves performed that WWE wrestlers are either too roided up to pull off or not athletic enough. Sabin, Shelly, Jay Lethal, Sonjay and Senshi are more talented than 90% of the WWE roster.     2)If you try to use the arguement that WWE has way better storylines, than you haven't been watching wrestling that long. WWE has recycled so many storylines that it's a stretch just for them to come up with something fresh. I'm not saying TNA storylines are any better, but difference in crappy storylines aren't that far apart.|`|7u7N8gkiaa	i think that the fans should watch both. im a tna fan and wwe fan. but ther is something i like about tna. they are like the old wwf. they have lots of better matches liek tables, hardcore, adn that stuff. but now the wwe  thinks that a true main event is tag team or something. tna would have a tables main event. thats why i like tna.|`|lzbxT6p9aa	Forget stupid gimmicks, WWE was full of them throughout the 90's when it was fast becoming the the runaway freight train it is today. Remember Doink the Clown?, Repo Man?, Gobbledeygooker?, Midian?, NAKED Midian?, Droz?, remember Scotty 2 Hotty & Grand masta Sexay? Isaac Yankem (now Kane) IRS? Hunter Hearst Helmsley (thank god he turned into Triple H) The list goes on.......    TNA don't breed their own talent? What about Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Abyss, James Storm, Eric Young, Robert Roode, AJ Styles, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin. OK some of them may have had WWE tryouts, but none of them ever made their name in WWE, so YES they do have their own talent.     The things that I like about TNA are their incredible X-division, the quick exciting matches that the x-division wrestlers have and the accompanying innovation matches, ie, the Ultimate-X, the Elevation-X, Thunderdome etc.     I also like the Knockouts. Unlike their WWE counterparts, they know how to wrestle! take Roxxi, ODB, The Beautiful People, Christy Hemme, Raisha Saeed, Taylor Wilde and the mighty AWESOME KONG! They are all fantastic wrestlers. The best female wrestler in the WWE is Beth Phoenix and that doesn't say a lot.     TAG TEAM DIVISION!!! Ok so WWE has tag team titles, but they are just there because they always have been. Vince made the latest SVR game all about tag teams and yet, the real life tag team divisions are a bit of a joke. TNA has some amazing tag teams. Beer Money Inc, Team 3D, Creed & Jay Lethal, Abyss & Morgan (ok so technically they split last week) LAX and quite possibly the greatest tag team in the world at present: The Motorcity Machineguns!    Yes I agree, TNA has it's flaws but so does WWE! oh look, John *yawn* Cena is champ (still!) and Edge returns and immediately wins the championship from Jeff Hardy. boring!!!.    I would say to a WWE fan, if you want something a bit different, perhaps to watch some of your favourite wrestlers of the past in action again, check out TNA.
79366fe7ba342f158b20c761ff8b4203aa	Mike it would be fine. I fish for Reds and Trout all the time. I have over 20 tournaments scheduled for this year already. I use med and med heavy rods depending on the situation. For example if I'm fishing topwater I like a rod w/ more bend to it so I can work the lure better and so I dont pull it out of the fishs mouth. If I'm jigging I want something w/ a little more backbone so I can get a solid hookset. It's all about matching your setup to your situation Feel free to E-mail me for more info|`|4Nx9ZVDyaa	i'd think it would, i sometimes use a smaller panfish rod for trout... and an ugly stick works good too...|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	No. you want really light tackle for redfish and trout. why? it makes it way more fun and a challenge.  you should use 8-10 lb test on light action spinning rod...UGLY stick custom, shimano,gloomis are all great rods...i also recomend a small reel that holds nothing larger than 12lb test line.  please dont kill the redfish or trout =) GOOD LUCK!
fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Were I in your shoes I'd probably keep the Open Pros. As mentioned before, Spinergy has a high speed wobble to them, and in my opinion using a larger bearing just adds friction and rotational mass- both bad things.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	i really don't know anything about topo other than what i've read. i haven't seen anyone use them yet. but i have had 3 sets of spinergy whls and none were tru to my standards, but they rode well other than speed wobbles. if i had your money i'd get a set of topo's just to tryout.   nice frame too.

And is no the best or even close to the best...  1- Payton Manning  2- Tom Brady  3- Kurt Warner  4- Drew Brees  5- Eli Manning  6- Donovan Mcnab  7- Big Ben...  So as you can see Big Ben's pretty far off number 1!|`|tVEm2eJXaa	Even though Tom Brady missed all of last year, I would still take Brady over Peyton Manning because Brady is a better postseason quarterback because Brady wouldn't have lost in the first round to a 8-8 team.|`|ELwysDcVaa	Tom Brady then Peyton Manning then RIch Gannon..LMAO..just playing....nah then Donovan McNabb...yea...had he won a super bowl i would say he..is still third best..i mean look at it...10 year veteran and been to his conference finals 5 times and often times losing only to the eventual super bowl winner...i mean yea a loss is a loss but maybe he just got stuck playin in the wrong era much like Clyde Drexler playin during the Jordan era|`|NLj70oJIaa	I gotta go with Peyton but Matt Ryan is the next upcoming!!|`|UQYurvnYaa	Ben Roethlisberger|`|a6EndAPiaa	Right now based on his complete body of work Peyton Manning.

The Patriots and the Colts make up 4/5ths of the AFC Pro-bowl starting offensive linemen year-in and year-out.

Tom Brady- Simply amazing! can take the most awful receiver and make him into pro bowl calibar  2. Peyton Manning- Genius in the game. Can identify a Defense with his eyes closed  3. Drew Brees- He has a cannon and like Brady, takes crappy receivers such as Devery Henderson and turns him into a beast  4. Phillip Rivers-The guy takes so many hits and has virtually no one to throw to and still throws for 34 Td's  5. Jay Cutler- Young and has not matured into the NFL, but in the next year or two he should start to excell, especially if Denver drafts some better D players so he can get on the field with his O more than 2 mins a game|`|exOOXAkBaa	Phillip Rivers: Does he have any receivers, yet he always comes through big.

T8E35b11aa	I'm also a liverpool fan,I think to be honest that whether we won or lost last night we paid a high price in that match    Torres=Injured ? (not fit at the very least)  Gerrard=Injured (out for who knows how long)  The rest played in what was obviously a very sapping game both for fitness and morale.    As for the lack of firepower if we're not gonna replace Keane we have to play the young lads we have at least they'll be the right players in the right positions    Benayoun on for Gerrard............really.    At least 1 positive came out of last nights game at least Lucas will be suspended for a bit now,he makes some of the worst decisions I've ever seen from a footballer|`|1e9Oh9ykaa	ya i think dat  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://bestinternetandcabletv.blogspot.c...|`|deG4RMJhaa	Surely we should have got at leastt one player,but for Everton,big disappointment!!!!|`|3a9fab97f268dfb84b622bec18cc0cd5aa	you was beat by a better team..  raffa must stay|`|AA11654248	What makes you a genuine Liverpool fan ?  Was Anfield the nearest ground to the hospital you were born in ?    It's funny to see any of the top 4 mess up.|`|FieTL52kaa	At least we might have a break from Lucas now. It's about the only positive to take from the game.|`|W1BGqz9Faa	They just have to concentrate on the League Championship.|`|p8lB73rdaa	I've been concerned for a long time now , Rafa's lost the plot !  His signings are in general crap apart from the odd exception and his team selections are baffling !  How anyone can think that Lucas is a good player is beyond me .  I doubt Rafa will be liverpool manager next season !|`|mK06dus9aa	Lack firepower? I thought Torres was supposed to be the second coming. Anyhow with Valencia in money trouble they will sell Villa outright before loaning him and Barcelona have been sniffing.|`|u9k4Orvpaa	i'm  amazed how things have changed since xmas for you bud ... i wouldn't say your in free fall but things ain't right at anfield are they..?? rafa needs to get his head together and hope Gerrard's and Torre's injury's are only minor or the sale of keane is gonna come back and haunt him ... you still have a chance with the league and C/L but the whole club needs to have a clear the air meeting before its to late ..|`|peFtORvUaa	Shouldnt have got rid of keane.|`|j3xwgrLBaa	I was more concered with the fitness of Torres   he didnt look right all night   since when did he get brushed of the ball by Leighton Baines?!  Where's his pace gone, he wasnt fit and it showed   The FA cup is no3 priority why play a player for so long when he's so blatently no where near fit     My concern is with the medical staff that passed him fit :S|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	Its not all bad news, at least Lucas will be banned after his red card, he can't do anymore damage on the pitch.    Apart from Gerrard and Torres, there is no one else to score goals. Kuyt cant trap a bag of cement, and would make a better cross country runner than a footballer, Babel never gets a cross in, a severe hindrance for a winger Benyoun is not the player he was at West Ham, and Dossena is just rubbish.|`|Q4lzLhIvaa	u well thank ur lucky stars    and  only have urselfs 2 blame, u rarely played robbie keane  and plus u wud be noffin without gerrard and torres
OMfBrpJiaa	Well, Reggie Jackson was called "Mr. October" because no matter how he played during the regular season, he had a reputation for coming up big in the playoffs to lead the Yankees in winning championships.  He was considered to be a clutch player for stepping up his efforts in the playoffs when it counted the most.    A-Rod, especially in the past several years, has been considered to be the best overall player (at the very least the best overall offensive threat) in baseball.  He has been the regular season American League MVP three times: 2003, 2005 and 2007.  And, his career 162 game average regular season stats include a career .306 batting average and an average of 44 home runs and 127 RBI's per year.      However, A-Rod's post-season offensive production since he has been with the Yankees has not been good.  This was especially true in 2005 and 2006.  In these years, he had a total of 3 hits in 29 at-bats for a combined batting average of .103 during the 2005 and 2006 post seasons with no home runs and no RBI's total for the two years.  Instead of leading the Yankees to championships, A-Rod's efforts helped lead the Yankees to early exits from the playoffs in both of these post seasons, with the Yankees losing in the ALDS (the first round division series) both years.    From further research attempting to determine the specific origin of the "Mr. April" nickname, it appears to have been coined by a sports writer in early 2007, after the first seven games of the season.  After those first seven games of 2007, A-Rod had a .357 batting average with 6 home runs and 14 RBI's.  The sports writer appeared to have coined the nickname as a double entendre.  On one hand, the nickname could literally reflect how well A-Rod was actually playing in April.  But, really, the sportswriter wanted to highlight A-Rod's lack of performance for the Yankees in the playoffs and compare it to his stellar performance for the Yankees in the regular season.  A-Rod's amazing performance in the first seven games of 2007 as compared to his dismal performance in the playoffs after the 2006 season seemed only to further solidify the A-Rod's reputation for being the opposite of a clutch player in the playoffs.      Since Reggie Jackson is widely considered to be the ultimate Yankee clutch player in the playoffs, he was given the nickname "Mr. October".  Now, the Yankee fans consider A-Rod to be the opposite of Reggie Jackson.  So, the sports writer gave A-Rod the nickname "Mr. April" to indicate that he is the opposite of "Mr. October".|`|fnWa1Bdlaa	I'm Very Question Someone.|`|6ad9d51cf0eb3915d774ed293ef5d282aa	he hit a hr practically every game in april last season or 2 seasons ago. but does april matter when you cant hit in the playoffs?|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	I'm guessing because he gets on a hot start in April.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	because hes a beast in april y else|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Because he does everything in April. In April, he is leading the MLB in AVG and in HR.    Also, it is used as a term to define cltuchness. October being the most (Since its the last month of MLB play) and April being the least.|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the answer above.|`|XxG9SqYoaa	Because he goes all bat *** crazy in April.|`|GyJqMWdUaa	He certainly isn't Mr. October.   Thats for sure.|`|0ff6026595b71e2fb6cc408869320d34aa	Because he does horrible in the playoffs. It's a twist on the nickname "Mr. October" that Reggie Jackson got for performing well in the playoffs.   ARod sucks in the playoffs but does well in the regular season where the games aren't as meaningful, so he's called "Mr. April", and it's not meant to be a compliment, but instead is meant to be an insult to his crappy postseason record.|`|nSSKixvCaa	I think maybe it is something to do with the start of MLB season. I feel he does pretty well in mid of season around all star as well.    A little bit streaky, isn't he?|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Mr. April - Hot early in the Season.  However, he's also called Miss October - terrible late in the season.  It's kind of a spin off of Reggie Jackson's nickname... and a joke.|`|d76cd84a9e6b8f094c2eda6057fa9431aa	In Boston he is known as Miss October.

There is one thing i hate more than the stupid kiddie winkle liverpool supporting users on here and its bigotry, i had heard this HEALY/KEANE theory before and it disgusts me, i hope its not true !
ydoIYwGTaa	I am a level 2 student of Krav Maga along with other formal Martial Arts I have taken. Krav Maga is really about defending yourself from a single or multiple attackers; protecting yourself to "fight another day". When you start out you learn how to protect yourself from different grabs and chokes. Then striking and kicking. After that you learn knife protection and disarm and finally move into gun disarm.  There are 10 levels of Krav Maga. Usually the last two are only taught to Military Personnel, so level 8 is as high as you can go.  I found the classes to be fun and another way to improve your defense. I would suggest taking other Martial Arts as no one Martial Art has all the answers. Just my opinion, but I would suggest Boxing or Muay Thai and BJJ to complient Krav Maga and make you a more rounded fighter.|`|AA11410928	Its pretty cool|`|S6vXpU7Caa	At a good karate dojo after a person has a good understanding of the basics they learn two man drills called nippon kumite.  The more advanced  a person becomes the more drills they learn.  These drills eventually teach throws, take a ways ( knife, club ext.)  What I think Krav maga is is nippon kumite. Krav maga was started by a guy who said he learned it from a old guy from Israel.  The person is pictured next to him in the add.  The guy that got trained is wearing a Karate belt, while the old guy is not.  In the founders credentials he list he is a third degree in Karate.  I think the guy basically took  the Karate he learned  and left out the Kata's, sparring and gee's and made up the name Krav maga. It may be a Hebrew name like another so called Hebrew art.  I'll tell you what.  20 years ago there were no so called Israeli  arts, but were a lot of Jewish people involved in Various martial arts. The guy might be trying to repackage Karate techniques to cash in on a trend.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	I am a Krav Maga Student in England.  I have to say that I have studied Ju Jitsu & Karate and find that Krav Maga is far, far better than both these.  The techniques used are simple but very aggressive and powerful.  You learn quickly how to defend against a knife/stick/gun etc.    The other good thing about it is that you can be any age, weight or sex.  Also you do not have to be super fit to start.  That said they expect you to put a 150% in and won't accept any less.  You don't need any experience with other Marial Arts and in fact I am finding that it's harder for me to get to grips with there stances as I always go into a Karate Stance and they have a complety different stance. You get fit, Mentally become strong and learn how to use aggression to overcome any apponent.  Let me give you an example:    A guy has a knife at your back and is asking for money... You have to pacify the guy by saying please don't hurt me and I have money I will give you it.  As you are saying this you look behind you to ensure the knife is at your back and not in the guys other hand.  Then in blinding speed you puch away the knife hand whilst turning inside your attacker and elbow in the face.  ( all at same time full force maximum aggression ) then you lock the knife hand arm and kick to the groin.  You then execute the knife wrist into a lock and prise the knife out of the attackers hand.  This is done in seconds, learnt in seconds and easy to remember.   Go for it.  You will love Krav Maga.|`|4AbXxowTaa	It's the fighting style of the Israelis, I know that it involves a lot of disarming your opponent.  It's also pretty popular in action movies.|`|vi1bbvCXaa	krav maga doesnt teach you how to fight because it teaches you how to defend yourself. youtube krav maga, i waz amaze by krav maga the first time i saw it because you deal with real life situation like people point the gun at you, people use knife, how to disarm people etc. but you have to understand that if you fight against martial artists, you are likely to lose BUT it is all depends on the fighters anyway. if you talk about karate and krav maga, for self defense, definitely krav maga because it is designed to defend yourself. whereas karate still self defense but also for fighting.

Isnt that what its mostly about.|`|QzLECTUpaa	Well Stats and Regular seasons Records are the main two sector to look for in a MVP award and a great Example of that is when Dirk had the Award because to be honest people voted for Dirk because he was putting up crazy numbers and the team is cruising with i think 66wins in 2006 - 2007 season and when the Mavericks loss to Golden State in the 1st round playoffs, people who voted for Dirk regreat voting for him, so its all about (Stats - Numbers)  = MVP|`|H8FHx1HYaa	its either lebron or dwight for me|`|4DcvpQXfaa	YES    lebron is the top contender now!|`|rvl2f6ERaa	yeah kobe not getting this year b/c his team good and wade will come second|`|Pa3LKeBtaa	Yes. Kobe is really good but for the King's years he is doing very good. He's close to averaging a double-double if not a triple-double. He leads Kobe in boards and assists and steals. He's also extremely dedicated to the game and works really hard.|`|GswnLKtQaa	D-Wade deserves the MVP.    This season:    1st in scoring  1st in FG% among guards  3rd in steals  9th in assist  1st in blocks among guards.    He also lift the Miami Heat from worse record last year to 6th seed this year.|`|HLzS2z9laa	bron bron|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Statwise Yes    But Nba Announced That Best Stat DOESNT MEAN MVP    Kobe does stuff not counted in STATS|`|vFbzBo4eaa	LeBron deserves it more than Kobe,Kobe should go home or quit this thing|`|AA10744471	Right now, LeBron is way ahead, but the NBA season is still a long way to go, so we have to wait until then. But I go for LeBron to be MVP. Sorry, Kobe.|`|N2177Ameaa	NO, I think that D-Wade deserves the award more than anybody. He's gone from a walking hospital to a force to be reckoned with.|`|j6NImFHgaa	I think not. The MVP award should always go to Kobe, until he retires. Then there will be room for someone else to get it.|`|vFJtmmN0aa	lebron is earning it and i think 2nd should be d wade|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Right now, it's LeBron in a landslide over Kobe.  His PER is 31.96, which is not only tops this season, it's on a course to be the highest PER for any season in recent history.  Kobe is back in fifth place with a PER of 25.59.    But it's not just that, the league and the media are all ready to hand the "next Jordan" crown over to LBJ and hope he lives up to it.  Giving the award to Kobe last year cleared the decks of the players from the early part of the decade who haven't won it yet.  Now the NBA is ready to move on to the LeBron/Wade/CP3/Howard era, and giving LeBron the MVP this year will be the first step.|`|5ANmjtLOaa	Jellybean is MVP, he doesn't need 1,000,000 dribbles to score 50+ and 95% of the ball in a game.

HkwUGOmxaa	the board is perfect for you. It is NOT too stiff. The yukon is the stiffest. The fleetwood is a bit wide but it will still turn easily. It will have better stability for landings and deep snow. I like width. I have riden it and is fun. For what you have told me I would sell it to you. How much money and how old. The more it has been riden the softer it gets. Place the board on the ground and step between the bindings. If it doesnt resist or spring back then it could be too soft...so the price should be low. If its got alot of spring and bounce in it then you are good. I have been riding for 16 years and worked in the snowboard industry for 8. I would say go for it. If you have any doubts then go to ridesnowboards.com. remember the guide lines are a ballpark...not the rule. You wont know til you try. Ride it twice....if its not for you then sell it and move on. I am 6'2" and 210lbs size 11 boot and I ride a Ride dose wide 162cm.|`|ucot94w3aa	I would say that this should be an excellent board for you.  You have fairly big feet for your weight so a wide board would definitely  be advisable.  The Fleetwood is a very nice snowboard.  It's not a high-end board, but it performs quite well.  It's a solid all-mountain board.

I was over a friend's house, and we were out in the yard making a snowman.  His sisters kept ambushing us, but, I was the only one they kept hitting hard in the face.  After about the third time, when the older sister hit me very hard right in the eye, I started crying, and she responded with, "Ohhh, poor little baby".  My "rhino temper" had had enough, and I took off after her.  When she slipped and fell, I pinned her down, packed about 4 nice ones, and gave her a good taste of her own medicine, yelling, "IT WAS FUNNY WHEN I WAS GETTING IT, HOW COME ITS NOT FUNNY NOW???"  Needless to say, she didn't find it to be so funny when she was the one getting hit hard in the face!  Her younger sister went in to tell her parents.  My friend thought I was a bully for being so mean to his poor younger sister, and tried to lay a guilt trip on me.   I was asked to go home, and my parents were called.  Even though, when they saw how bruised my eye was, they believed my side of the story regarding what happened, I still got grounded for, "Being mean to a girl", and got a reputation as a guy who picks on poor defenseless  little girls (even though the sister I got back at was only two years younger then me)  in my neighborhood for the rest of the winter.  I've tried to avoid anything that even slightly resembled a snowball fight ever since.|`|vcx06TdQaa	*hides in the bushes and waits for his target*    Got you!|`|X7DDlR1caa	.. don't get it in my eye! that happened to me 3 times the other day and it stings :(

KOsGtal8aa	snooker counts as a sport, but i see it more of a game. its a fantastic sport, cos its so much like chess, u need absolute focus on body and mind, each move is perfected to benifit there next shot. the accuracy and the targeting is mind blowing, the understanding of the angles n geometric of the table and the ball is key to having a good possition on every shot.and so is the understanding of the combination of force, speed and spin on the ball. the players accuracy is incredible. just like chess, snooker takes a long time to learn, but a life time to master it.|`|pMhc2ywbaa	what the hell is snooker|`|w5BVDGmOaa	Snooker is a sport and I think it is boring
ACXoLn2daa	When doing any walks of such nature good walking boots are essential. They will help prevent injury to you feet and ankles if you slip.They will also provide excellent support for you feet.

Get proper walking boots for your walk on the wall.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	You need to wear good, supportive footwear for any long distance walk.    Trainers tend to be comfortable - but not especially tough.  They won't protect your feet from stones & rocks, they won't support your feet (arches & ankles) as walking boots would and they are unlikely to be waterproof.  They are also unlikely to be breathable (so your feet will get hot & sweaty if the weather is warm or wet, hot & sweaty if it is raining!)|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	No, Go for football boots.

jY6cis4Kaa	I definitely agree. For at least two years now, I've been saying that Williams could give Mayweather problems, if he uses his size and reach perfectly to his advantage. Mayweather is quick and good defensively and the best weapon to use against quick fighters is the jab. With arms as long as Williams and as much of a height difference he has, if he keep on the outside and jab his *ss off, then it would be very difficult for Mayweather to successfully get off his own offense or land anything significant.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	His size would cause anyone who is only 5'8" (probably more like 5'7") a lot of problems.    Its not his nature, but if he were to throw fewer punches he would have a better chance to win - Floyd would have fewer opportunties to counter and would already be limited by the height disparity.    Mayweather beat the hell out of Corrales who was about 6', but he didn't have the same overall length and size of Williams.      If Williams were inclined to engage in a slow boring fight, he would have a much better chance to win, than pushing foward and letting Mayweather far superior technical ability shine through.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	If he used his height and skills from the outside, maybe. I like the way he fights too. He would probably be the only one to give Mayweather many problems. Floyd was so quick. It would take a boxer like Williams to land first. But he would still be countered by Floyd.|`|lrJN4M49aa	Yes Paul Williams because of his length and reach could give Mayweather some trouble, but I also thought the same thing about Diego Corrales and he was decimated by Mayweather. Mayweather is quicker, has superior boxing technique, and is more experienced. It's a good fight that Mayweather will ultimately win, plus Mayweather is a fighter who takes that unbeaten record more serious than most boxers today he wants to stay perfect, thats extra motivation for him.|`|Gj8JTJGRaa	hell yea|`|7domw3t5aa	yea he would cause floyd tons of problems. The dude above was right saying that floyd is a far more superior boxer but floyd would mess around and have a chance to be knocked out in that one. I would like to see how their reaches measure up to each other cuz floyds arms are long too. Floyd would have to engage to win the fight which he doesnt do. Floyd would see and block a ot of pauls punches but paul throws so much, he would put alot of pressure on floyd. I think floyd would win the fight but he would have a lot of problems.|`|kg33NLi3aa	there has been alot of boxers who gave mayweather a hard time but when he become p4p champ he picked his fights zab judah and Oscar gave him a hard time that's all but before he had Castillo twice nudua? so paul williams could cause big problem for floyd but floyd boxed well when he beat a tall fighter the late diego chico col.....|`|7dfrPX7Eaa	he would cause problems for any of his opponents who are much shorter than he is.|`|AA10744471	I agree with you. With Paul Williams' height at 6'1" and reach, he could easily outbox Mayweather with his long arm and style of mixing it up. That is why many fighters are avoiding him. He is young and could still be here for a long time.    Paul Williams   Statistics   Real name Paul Williams   Nickname(s) The Punisher   Rated at Welterweight   Height 6 ft. 1 in. (185 cm.)   Nationality American   Birth date July 27, 1981 (1981-07-27) (age 27)   Birth place Aiken, South Carolina   Stance Southpaw   Boxing record   Total fights 37   Wins 36   Wins by KO 27   Losses 1     WBO welterweight title    Williams became the mandatory challenger for WBO welterweight champion Antonio Margarito. The match took place July 14, 2007, in Carson, California, at the Home Depot Center with Williams winning by decision. Williams fought Carlos Quintana on February 9, 2008 in his first defense of his title. Williams was out boxed by the challenger Quintana throughout and lost by decision.    Williams and Quintana had a rematch at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut on June 7, 2008 for the WBO welterweight title. Williams got off to a quick start when a left hand sent Quintana into a daze as several follow-up barrages put Quintana down. He got up, but Williams opened up with dozens of unanswered punches as the referee jumped in to stop the fight while Quintana was going down again.    Williams was rumored to be moving up two weight classes to fight Kelly Pavlik for the WBO Middleweight Title but instead Pavlik has decided to move up two weight classes himself to fight Bernard Hopkins. Williams fought Andy Kolle on September 25. Williams dominated the fight from the start and recorded a first round knockout in 1:37 seconds.|`|6QhACK70aa	maybe but mayweather is by far superior as boxer!  paul williams if he had any decent skills he would gain some weight and go fight another division with kessler and froch, HE TOO SKINNY FOR HIS HEIGHT!  there is no glory beating better boxers than u ,only cause u have better reach and big height!  on valuev yall can see that but in williams not??  double standards AGAIN??LOL  paulie should fight some men his height, in bigger divisions and leave alone EXCELLENT BOXERS like mayweather,hatton and pacman, NO GLORY IN WELTERWEIGHT FOR HIM!

I don't imagine it will be very light though, or that the front suspension forks will be very good.     You could try looking for 2nd hand bikes on Ebay. Use the Advance search feature to look for bikes local to you. The sellers on here tend to be fairly honest with their description as they realise they will get slated if they sell you a pile of Cr@p. To give you an idea I recently sold a 500 racing bike on there for 220. It was 5 years old but in excellent condition. The buyer knew they had got a good deal on it.|`|zrhJHsUxaa	You wont get anything good for that price unless you buy from a garage sell and the people dont know what they have. You can get a new bike from Wal-Mart, Target....for that price but it wont last long unless you are easy on it. Go to a bike shop and look at the prices and talk to some people and ask about last year model bikes they may be trying to get rid of for the new years stock.|`|elY5vkVyaa	Personally I would buy a good quality pre-owned bike from a private seller and clean it up but you need to know what you're doing for that to be a cheap option. I also much prefer steel-framed bikes to aluminium, ally frames are super-light and great for mountain bikes but they feel horrible to ride compared to old-fashioned steel.    That Muddy Fox Ella looks like a pretty good deal though.

rGGymoowaa	Ever since 1988 professionals have been allowed into the Olympics has the ban was lifted. This was why Tennis was removed from the Olympics after 1924 as there was some ? as to whether or not the players where really amateurs (Even though tennis was supposed to be an amateur sport for many years until the OPEN ERA money was secretly given along with other from of gifts and compensation. They called it a gentleman's handshake agreement). Tennis returned in 1988 as the ban was lifted and r Steffi Graff won the Gold medal in the Women singles.     It was decided that allowing professionals into the Olympics made sense as the rules on amateurs where antiquated (Created by the 19th Century aristocracy as they felt being paid to play a sport was undignified) and also a farce. Many countries around the world most notability USSR and East Germany  created pro-amateur programs thus blurring the lines.     In fact one of the earlier Olympic  sports to scrap amateurism was Athletics in 1982 thus opening up the competition  to a larger number of high performing athletes. Ever since 1997 prize money has been awarded by the IAAF to those athletes that won and performed at high level thus allowing athletes to be financially secure to pursue their sport.     Olympic Boxing is one of the few  sports in which the sport is onlly opened to amateurs.|`|hdewiFYyaa	The Olympic games are for professionals. its for the best athletes in the world, to compete against each other and see whos the best!! Thats why Rafa Nadel was there.|`|dCbIHBpGaa	The olympics have let professionals into all kinds of sports for a while now - look at the basketball with all those NBA stars in!! I think there is an opinion that people would find Nadal more interesting to watch than some amateurs that nobody has ever heard of. Having said that though, I'm not sure how important the Olympics are to some players though - am sure they would rather win the US Open than a gold medal!
4EesoL2xaa	Pros for skiing:    -Anyone can learn to do it.  Even if you're blind.  -You don't have to be in great shape to do it.  -Professional ski racers are the most under-rated athletes in the world.  Two days ago I watched a Super-G race from the lift and I still can't get over how these people can jump while leaning in one direction and land on their edges in the opposite direction.  They're amazing.  -You can do it at any age.  You wouldn't believe the amount of 60 and 70 year olds who rip.    Cons:  -Its expensive.  -It doesn't show well on television.  -Professional skiiers don't make much money compared to other athletes.    Pros for Football:    -It shows amazingly well on tv.  -It is a lot of fun to watch, whether in person or on tv.  -You can make a lot of money doing it.    Cons:  -Not everybody can play.  -You have to be in top shape to play.  -You have to start young (under 15).  -You have to end young.      Final verdict:  Skiing owns.|`|mRvZq0VZaa	Footballs a team sport and skiings a individual sport.  If you're the type of person that craves individual challenges and likes to know exactly who's at fault if something doesn't go your way, then skiings for you.

When the boys I teach kick a football at me I run away screaming like the woman I am, but stick me at the top of a black run and I'm happy!    Watching skiing on TV is great when it's the men's downhill because they look heroic and masculine in their gear as they hurtle down the mountainside; however, the ladies don't do it for me because they all have elephantine thighs and look like men anyway.    Also, skiing seems to be a sport not undertaken by Chavs and it's always nice to get away from them.

As said above, you will want to select someone who will definitely be starting every game, so either O'Gara or Beauxis will be your best bet, even though I think Stephen Jones is the best No. 10, he keeps getting subbed for Hook.|`|yfmZDXPTaa	hmm idk at least ogara is a definate. he always does us proud. love him!|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	For opening games    France = Beauxis  Italy = Bortolussi  Wales = Jones (Henson from length)  Ireland = O'Gara  England = Goode  Scotland = Godman|`|Iz5kUsCGaa	goode might not be playin  i want toby flood the guys is sickk|`|GwEs2TDxaa	If you're choosing for a fantasy league team, go with O'Gara, he's the only kicker who is more or less guaranteed to be chosen as such for every game, the others chop and change too much. I would hesitate to pick Jones because he always seems to get substituted for Hook later in the game!|`|45deb346668a7b66aee588c0399444f9aa	Exactly Henson is injured and Paterson's been dropped.    England will be Goode  Italy will be Marcato  Scotland will be Godman  Wales will be Jones  Ireland will be O'Gara  France will be interesting!
Cl6KbcAGaa	The cycling industry as a whole has gradually changed over to disc brakes on even its lower end bikes. The stopping power of a disc vs linear pull brakes is second to none and why wear down a rim when you can wear down a rotor (such as on a car) and if the wheel gets out of true the rotor does not. Now there are low end disc brakes and of course high end too and there is a difference in quality here too. The cheaper the bike then generally the cheaper the components that come with it too. As far as your frame material   aluminum is strong and you usually start with a 6061 alloy (alumimum) on the lower end stuff but still good bikes. Anymore these days you will find dept store bikes to be made from Alloy (steel / aluminum mix) and Any stainless frame would likely be a road bike?? Carbon fiber for high end road and mtn bikes, and titanium for high end road bikes and this one looks like stainless steel although I dont believe I have ever seen a stainless frame....too heavy! Stay away from the dept store type bike or bike shaped objects as they are known.   Spend a bit more from a reputable dealer near you and you will get a better bike. There is more maintenance on a disc brake bike and those equipped with hydraulic brakes are worth the $ but not something you can fix on the trail unless you have everything you need in a pack and you know how to do it properly go for disc brakes that are mechanical and once you get used to them then you can upgrade from there.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	Disc brakes are the best because they work well wet and they seem to do better if the wheel gets a little untrue over time.  But that said pull brakes work great 90 percent of the time.  The frame is important for strenght and for weight reduction the lighter the frame the easier it is to ride the bike.  I prefer Aluminum but I know some guys with carbon fiber but its super expensive.  I just bought a Trek 4500 which is a great road/mountain bike.|`|632df825b0e29d016edbbea6b6ff6ea4aa	Try looking at an brand named Aluminium framed,27 speed, disk brake bike at an affordable price to you.  A lightweight bike that is sized correctly will be a bonus.  Visit a well stocked bike store and ask questions.  Good luck!|`|7l4tR0aZaa	well if u dont give us a budget or price range we cant help u. i will include a link with everythingu need to know about buying a mountain bike    http://vernoncycle.com/page.cfm?pageID=3...            hope  i helped|`|JSGLKnA4aa	disc's are better for stopping power and hold. but even as ppl have said you don't notice untru wheels as much. you should be checking wheels for tru and spoke tension. personally i like the feel of highend steel or Ti frames over alum. frame material shouldn't be an issue for first time rider. fit and set-up are more important.most bikes come with disc brk anyway except for real lowend bikes. brands: specialized, kona,norco, giant.
c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	You have a bit of a dilema.  You are spending a reasonable amount, which will get you a specific tool.  However you are not sure what you want to buy.  So:    Sugestion one.  Buy two bikes.  Spend 500 on a road bike and 500 on an entry level hartail mountain bike.  This means that your commute should be quite fast, whereas you can yehar it at the weekend.    Evans is a good sugestion.  However, for this sort of money, no matter the manufacturer, you should get a reasonable machine.    Don't get your bike to do too much.  1000 will get you a viable entry level full susser, with hydraulic discs (Ignor the muppet who said that you should get cable brakes).  However, it will also get you a stonking hard tail.  Good, light kit, nice suspension and race viable.    Makes.  I don't know what to recommend for road bikes, other than to stick with one of the big manufacturers, Giant, Specialized, Trek.    However, For mountain bikes, Try a Boardman, from Halfords (Get your local bike shop to check it over once the Wombles at Halfords have tried to set it up).  The boardman has really great spec SRAM X0, without cutting corners, for 1000.    If you want something that is good on the trails and is generally set up well, try Specialized.  If you want speed and light, try Scott.  If you want a nice Euro bike, try Cube.      However, here is the problem that you face.  If you go around most motorcycle shops, you will see some nearly new, slightly damaged, superbikes for sale.  What has happened is that an old boy who has not been on a machine for 20 years, asks his mates what a good bike is.  They then go out and buy the bike and find that the technology has moved on and as soon as they agresivly open the throttle, the twitchy race specced machine pulls a stonking wheely and launches the rider at the nearest parked car.    So I can tell you what I think a good cycle is, but for that sort of money, DON'T take my word for it.  Go to your local bike shop and sit on a few.  Attend some test days or hire the machine your interested in.  Do not believe a word that the piply youth at Halfords mumbles at you.    In short, you will feel better if you do a bit of homework yourself, since it is your bike, your tool and only you will know what feels right.    Luck|`|OCMrQVRxaa	get a treack bruser 2 amazzinly smooth 2 ride on and of road|`|AA11603594	Try the Giant Halo 1,Norco Bigfoot,Mongoose Teocali Comp,Trek 8000-test drive what you feel would suit your style-rutlandcycling.com,winstanleysbike... for a better price, lad!|`|oPbLcfKoaa	Hi Michael...    I suggest that you avoid hydraulic discs at this price since they tend to be of low quality and won't be any better than higher quality mechanical discs, plus they will have a shorter maintenance cycle which means you'll have to have them serviced more often.    Visit an Evans Cycles in or around London and take a look at their Pinnacle range. This has become a favorite of mine to recommend to our UK friends since I saw that Bikeworks was enamored of them. Pinnacle is of very good quality and usually has better components for a lower price.|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	The above answer nails it. Try Evans Cycles and look at their Pinnacle line. http://evanscycles.com|`|R0mZqqfXaa	Check out the Genesis range.
HtYGxZcCaa	I wasnt alive to see it but I saw Glory Road where it was reinacted and loved the movie. I would reccomend for anybody to watch it.|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	No, as I was not even close to being born yet, but I believe Texas Western defeated the wildcats, and for that they deserve the utmost respect.|`|vuDE5TPbaa	Yes. Watch "Glory Road". It's all about that. They said that it was the greatest upset in NCAA history. It was also a great stepping stone for equality and equal rights in America.     It's like Remember the Titans but with basketball.|`|RQf13R74aa	I was 17 and watched it on TV.  Pat Riley was on the Kentucky team...
BkTH7LiIaa	I had a friend attend some classes with this master.  Whatever he charges or doesn't charge you need to take the art seriously if you want to train with him.  Do not waste his time.  If you're just going to "try him out," then just choose someone else.  But if you're truly serious in adopting this lifestyle then please seek him out.    This friend of mine wasn't charged a cent and was given excellent instruction with one stipulation.  He needed to practice what he was taught until the next time they met.  And only then would he consider accepting him as a paying student.  Other than that it would not matter how much money my friend offered, He Jinbao would not teach him.  Needless to say my friend did not practice and has never sought instruction from He Jinbao again.    He Jinbao is an excellent Baguazhang master.  Seek him only if you are truly interested.|`|4olfKMjUaa	Hi, I attended classes with He Jinbao in Ann Arbor Mich. He is a good instructor, and he takes his Bagua VERY seriously. Try this site Great Lakes Wushu.com and the site listed below, I hope it helps!
dfBwVxXFaa	Mathews solo-cam is about the best, but also about the most pricey!|`|ZKikquiOaa	A bow is actually a very personal thing.  Going out and buying the best money can buy can and have backfired.  A friend of mine got a bow from his girlfriend, it was Hoyt's top of the line at that time.  At $500 just for the riser, it ain't cheap.  He just couldn't get used to the bow, after shooting it for 6 months, he gave it up and switch back to his $150 bow.    Best thing to do is to take it to the shop and have him try out a few, I know it ruins the surprise and all, but a bow is all about the feel to the archer.  Pricey doesn't always equal best.  The second best thing is to talk to his archery buddies and see if any of them know the bow he's been eyeing.|`|qHUcyrytaa	Bowtech is a quality bow for the money. If money isn't an option I would buy a Matthews or a Hoyt.|`|oyuguD2Zaa	I was shooting a matthews, but i switched to the new PSE, they are kind of pricey, but very good.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Matthew's or Hoyt.*|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Just like the guy above stated, best for him is going to be different than best for me.  I chose the Alpine Silverado and couldn't be happier.  My brother doesn't like it, but loves his PSE X force 7.  A good friend went with the Mathews Drenalin, and loves it.  Neither one of us like it.  I would get him a gift certificate to a archery shop.  Let him pick the one that is just right.  He'll need to select a draw weight and length even before he choses manufacture or model.   I would recommend looking at several models before he decides.  The Mathews my buddy has is one of the top rated bows around, but I think the grip is too narrow, and my Alpine is faster (I do shoot a heavier draw, though), and quieter.  It's just too much personal preference to make a good recommendation.  I would recommend that he at least shoot a Alpine before he makes up his mind though, I've loved mine.|`|4fe7c48ee8b892832c04be92742c7894aa	Bow sights are an integral for successful bow hunting.
