xCbirkdOaa	I do German and it's tonnes of fun. A language qualification is a benefit when working in a company, whatever language you chose, they're both as important and as useful as each other. Companies will employ a person who speaks two or more languages because they feel that you would be a good communicator for customers. It doesn't matter which you chose, in the end, they are both useful. Triple science is tricky, i don't know about latin, or french. Some of my friends do all three and they seem to be coping fine. You should choose the language you enjoy most, rather than the benefits of each, because they have the same benefits and drawbacks as each other. <br>  <br>  I found French harder because it's got all those accents and rules whereas German has fewer accents and you can spell out the words the way they are said. You cover the same topics in each, so just go with the language you find more enjoyable. You can't judge how enjoyable a subject is by how other people found it. Whichever one YOU enjoy should be the one you do. Don't let other people influence your decision.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your GCSE's<br>  <br>  Hattie x|`|WKgvwCNZaa	Well, I personally think that French is more useful.

5q7uPqVmaa	One argument I think would be that unfortunately the Civil War was not a miracle that managed to make race relations perfect.  Racism still existed and despite some legislation and some initial gains, life did not change totally for many African-Americans living in the former Confederacy.  Racist laws such as poll taxes and literacy tests prevented the vast majority of African-Americans from voting or participating in political events.  Sharecropping and economic events prevented many African Americans from taking advantage of freedom.  Laws segregating schools and making it difficult for many to obtain a good education to allow people an away out of difficult economic circumstances.<br>  A counter argument?  There were exceptions, of course, and some people did make great economic and educational gains despite the difficulties.  Slavery was ended and at least in theory people were supposed to allow all men to vote, regardless of race, even if the reality was somewhat different.

He is one of the most intelligent men I know. However, even he admits that he thinks he would have been a lot further along in his life had he completed high school.<br>  <br>  My brother also got his GED. He immediately turned around and got his Adult diploma. he recently finished his Bachelors and is considering Law School. He shares the same sentiment as my colleague.<br>  <br>  I, on the other hand, finished high school. After some time in the military I went to school and got my Associates degree, and have not yet completed by Bachelors. I make a really good living, but I still don't think I have the same earning potential as my brother and friend.<br>  <br>  My sister didn't complete high school from reasons similar to yours. She hasn't made any attempt to further herself, and I don't think she will any time soon.<br>  <br>  It really depends on you and your level of commitment to your future.

58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Piece of cake! They also call it "micro-blogging". Basically what you do is to answer the question "what are you doing?" using a very short entry. Updates of your entries are shown on the people that is "following you" (checking what you write) and that way they can learn your daily life on detail. If you are already a blogger, you may be wondering "why should I use Twitter if I'm already making entries about things that happen in my life?" Well, the thing is.. you are not going to make a blog entry because you had a cup of tea or watched Bakugan on the TV... these kind of very small things that are also part of your daily life is what made micro-blogging a success! I'll explain, by making these very small entries your family and friends get a more broader picture of the things that you do and your real character. Well, I hope that helped!

I teach at the primary level and almost all children who begin kindergarten are five rather than six so you'd have to look at the older edge of your ages.  I teach 4th grade and most of the kids in my class begin at age 9 and turn 10 at some point during the year, although a couple were 8.  I'd say that most 16 year olds are sophmores or juniors.  In high school, some classes are mixed for the grades but others might have only one year in them.

Eg3VqGsuaa	you know, i'm somewhat in same category ur in. all through middle/high school i've been deciding and coming up with a million and 1 things to be but THANKS to my CRAZY mom, she made me feel guilty for not wanting to be in the medical field (she's a laboratory technologist and my dad is a radio/ultrasound technologist). She also made everything else i wanted to be seem bad. Plus everyone and their GRANDMA says i'll always have job in the medical field, so i finally just said "HELL, why the F*CK not!" and chose nursing just to shut everyone up. However, i'm not doing so hot in these nursing pre-reqs and i'm scared i won't make it into the nursing program. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry i can't tell you what do BUT if you give up and go through with nursing and graduate THEN you can go back to college and do what you REALLY wanted to do in the 1st place. You'll have the money because you'll be working as a nurse with me :) (if i get in the program)|`|LguXFbvsaa	When people enjoy what they do, they are inherently good at it, and if those first two things are true, they will inevitably make money doing it. If you have no interest in nursing now, you probably never will. I'm sure you're familiar with the qualifications, classes, and areas you would be studying if you pursued a career in nursing. Due to the fact that you have been around so many nurses in your life, I'm sure you're exceptionally aware of what their jobs/lives entail. If you are not intrigued - don't force yourself.<br>  <br>  The best answer, I think, is to find something that you thoroughly enjoy doing, and figure out what job might include that/those thing(s). If you like English, but are skeptical, you could try communications. It's a very broad degree that one can use to pursue careers in politics, writing, teaching, journalism (print or broadcast), PR, law, etc. <br>  <br>  Most people with a psychology degree that I know have ended up doing nothing with it. Unless you intend to become a professor or a psychiatrist/psychologist, I wouldn't pursue that degree. <br>  <br>  Whatever career path you go down... you will spend 60% of your time at your job as an adult. Do not pick something because you were pressured, or because you think you might make a lot of money, or because it's more convenient for you now. Try to figure out what keeps you interested and motivated, and use that as a clue to what field you might see yourself in, doing well, and enjoying it.<br>  <br>  Best of wishes, hon :) You'll be fine.|`|T9c3u1ATaa	be a math major! ...I'm liking it. lol k more seriously , I would just tell you to do your daily research.

Don't let anyone tell you what to do. NOW GO OUT THERE AND BE A DENTIST! -lol Joking.<br>  <br>  Though, it really won't be a bad idea- you know, to be a dentist. That's where I'm going at right now. My mother wanted me to go into business and wouldn't stop pushing me on the subject. Then, I too wanted to be a psychologist but I went to a career counselor and she thought I would be great as a dentist. My mother supports that idea even more then her own- It's still in the medical field, better work hours, and less stress. Not to mention it pays more then medical doctor or even surgeons (excluding plastic surgeons of course).<br>  <br>  Anyway, if English is really what you want to do, go for it! Community colleges have bad teachers anyway, they aren't really teachers, so maybe it not you but them.<br>  <br>  --Good Luck, CutieNiki|`|Skfi9F6Laa	If you're interested in a medical career, consider becoming a physicians assistant.

HjiqMDI6aa	I'd put myself in a high school in the mordern day and take up roles related to Shakespeare. Like if you ever watch the film 'She's the Man' which is a mordenised version of Shakespeare's 'The Twelfth Night', you can do a monologue where you say a few Shakespearan lines that go like 'Amidst thy love and thy worthiness...blah di blah di blah' then, you can translate that by giving a more recent version like how people now would say it like 'Yeah, so right, like, this guy, who I love, is SO fit...blah di blah di blah'... Basically you switch between an old Shakespearan character and a new mordern student.<br>  <br>  Also, you can do a scene where people are telepathic and send each other message through telepathy just by thinking stuff about each other and one of your roles can be Lauren Cooper from the Catherine Tate Show and the other is Lauren's teacher.<br>  <br>  Get creative!|`|zg82CYzIaa	I love the monologue from Macbeth where Lady Macbeth is starting to go insane and she talks to herself, and then starts to talk to owls and stuff.<br>  <br>  Enter LADY [MACBETH].<br>        LADY MACBETH <br>    1   That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; <br>    2   What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.

CXlqq0wPaa	ok, so you have the balanced reaction. The reaction tells you that the ratio between lead nitrate and sodium nitrate is 1:2, which can be 1mol:2mol. Therefore, 2 mol sodium nitrate would be produced. Now, to convert this to mass, use the periodic table. Add together the atomic masses of Na, N, and 3 oxygens. This gives you the molar mass of sodium nitrate, or the mass of 1 mol of sodium nitrate. Since your reaction gives you 2 mol sodiium nitrate, multiply the molar mass by 2.

Removing these items from your psyche now qualifies you "practice law".<br>  <br>  After undertaking this crucial first step, you will find that no matter which law school you attend, upon passing the bar, you will be initiated into a fraternity of scumbags and weasels who work in tandem to ensure mutual financial success.<br>  <br>  With this in mind, I recommend a secondary major in Finance, so as to hold on to your ill-gotten future bounty.<br>  <br>  An internship with Satan himself is highly valued among Esquires, although serving one of his lower demons is a commendable means of beefing up your legal resume.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and see ya in hell!|`|AA10065077	I would probobly do business management or human resorces. A lot of people have questions that are labor related that's why I'm recommending that. Depending on your finances there is always the top colleges like yale and harvard, but your state college is just as good. Just the name is all your paying for. As for interships I would check with the local law firms in your home town. Chances are they've been where you are now and would be more than willing to help. They also might give you "professional" advice because they might recognize your name from high school. Also I believe there is this thing called the LSAT. Score high on that and you've got any school you want to go to in a bag. Just please don't be like a lot of lawyers  that sell their soul. Good luck to you.

I found that after I read a section of the book, I would summarize/paraphrase what i just read, that way i had to pay attention.

Try to be focused and set an aim before you start and then try to accomplish it. Don't leave today's work for tomorrow.

I believe that school days are indeed the best, where we can cry, laugh, shout, play together without much worries. =D

KPP3ahlYaa	Basically, regarding Macduff, Act 4 seems to appear to the audience that Macduff's decision to leave england solo was a terrible decision, as his wife and son was murdered. Lady Macduff says, "From whence himself does fly? He loves us not:" is ironic as she still knows her husband does love her even though he has left for england. This part shows their strong love for each other and thus we as audience do feel that Macduff's decision of leaving was not properly thought through since he left his family. Besides, the scene where Lady Macduff and her son has a light conversation jokingly further shows the strong love the family holds for each other. Note that their conversation mainly revolved round Macduff, Lady Macduff and Son. Thus, we see that Macduff's decision to leave had brought on fatal consequences as seen in the murder. <br>  <br>  For the second question, I would choose to put the entire scene in. Throughout the whole play where there is mostly gore, ambitious thinkings, murder, this scene acts like a "comic relief" and creates a light mood, as compared to the other parts of the play. This scene, portraying the deep love the Macduff family has for each other will gain the audience's sympathy when Lady Macduff and her son are being killed. It brings out a more heartfelt feeling. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, just had my Literature Exam on Macbeth =P

rsNX7bdgaa	Hace poco mi hija tuvo su primer novio y al poco tiempo cortó con él (tiene 18 a?os, yo para esa edad ya había tenido varios novios y relaciones sexuales con cada uno de ellos).<br>  <br>  Yo vi un poco triste a mi hija y ella me comentó que lo que la entristecía era que a él no le importó que ella lo cortara y yo le pregunte que si había  tenido relaciones con él y ella me dijo que no (que aún era virgen).<br>  <br>  <br>  Yo loe dije, pero estas consciente de los riesgos que se corren con las relaciones sexuales y me dijo si ya se que puedo salir embarazada y lo de las enfermedades venéreas.<br>  <br>  Yo le dije: Pero hay otro riesgo mucho mayor y es el emocional, cuando tu tienes relaciones, la separación de un novio lo vas a sufrir como un divorcio y si eres jovencita es probable que no estés preparada para un divorcio (mi último divorcio fue después de los cuarenta y de cualquier forma dolió a pesar de ser el tercero).<br>  <br>  Así que la edad para tener relaciones es : Cuando estés preparada para una ruptura con un tipo con el que tienes relaciones (un día mi mamá estaba extra?ada porque yo estaba tan molesta porque un novio me "corto" a los tres días y ella me decía que ?Como podía molestarme tanto si había salido con él tres días? lo que yo no le dije fue que ya había tenido relaciones con él).|`|auLrRiIhaa	A los 18, porq ya eres mayor de edad........<br>  <br>  y eres respondables de tus cuidados|`|ATW9UitZaa	Lee detenidamente y comprende lo que te voy a escribir.<br>    <br>    Se maneja en terminos generales y basada en estudios que a la edad de 18 anos un hombre y una mujer ya estan preparados fisica y mentalmente para tener relaciones y hacer vida de pareja.<br>    Tu expresas una palabra,DEBERIAN.<br>  Tener relaciones sexuales no es un deber,es una necesidad fisica,es una necesidad psicologica,es un placer que disfrutamos y que nosotros mismos si DEBEMOS DECIDIR cuando,con quien y en donde.<br>     El sexo es de lo mejor que tenemos en esta vida pero si lo haces con responsabilidad.Y sobre todo no tomes la decision de hacerlo tan solo por lo que te cuentan amigas(os) tantas historias,usualmente quienes presumen de tantas cosas las hacen pero solo en su imaginacion.<br>  <br>    Como dato importante:el hombre inicia su capacidad de reproduccion aproximadamente entre los 12-14 anos y una vez que empieza a producir espermatozoides maduros mantiene esta capacidad para toda la vida,solo disminuye la concentracion de espermatozoides en la eyaculacion paulatinamente a partir de los 45-50 y tambien va perdiendo su capacidad de ereccion pero no de reproduccion.<br>    La mujer inicia su capacidad de reproduccion desde su ninez a la edad de 10-13 anos,cuando tiene su primera menstruacion,asi ciclicamente va estar ovulando y menstruando hasta la edad de 40-45 que es aproximadamente cuando termina su capacidad de reproduccion y tambien cuando se embaraza.Cuando una mujer tiene varios hembarazos esta edad se prolonga algunos anos mas.<br>     Una mujer tiene diversos problemas cuando se embaraza pasando los 30.<br>  <br>     Espero haber contribuido a responder tu pregunta.|`|OtnrMtCAaa	uffff vaya una pregunta! tan complicada y compleja como la vida misma.<br>  Depende del hombre,  de la mujer y de su educación... de tantas cosas que la verdad nos llevaría horas tan solo el plantearlo.<br>  Pero aun así, no hay edad.<br>  <br>  un saludo.|`|Sh3MAfQxaa	el tiempo te lo determina la naturaleza que sabia,y te lo muestra cuando ya eres fertil en cada raza.por ejemplo echamos las perritas en cria a los 6 meses de vida porque son fertiles,las cerdas el hombre las echa en cria a los6 m,eses,las vacas a los 14 meses porque ya son fertiles.despues el hombre quiere determinar a que edad una hembra humana tiene que aparearse y diceeee 18!!!!!

Cada cuál debería esperar su momento, sin importarle el qué dirán (de última, es preferible decir una "mentirita piadosa" a tus amigas, a obligarte a hacer algo que no sentís). La primera experiencia nunca se olvida y puede influenciar tu futura vida sexual. Mi consejo? Sé más inteligente que el resto y esperá tu momento.

Well I say, ok, so what.  That won’t happen for another ten billion years or so.  We’re alive now!  We live in the now!  We have to grab the now with both hands.  We have to move through the light, be warmed by the sun, while we can.  I mean, someone or something set this whole thing spinning.

You will also need a degree, usually a teaching degree if you are going to teach primary as that covers all areas of primary curriculum, although you could do a degree in a subject you enjoy first and then top up with a year teacher training (either in University with teaching work placements, or alternatively a year working in a school and training at the same time).  Obviously if you are going to get a degree the University will want some qualifications on top of the GCSEs, but what they want varies from Uni to Uni.  Some will accept you without A levels if you do an Access course.|`|dkzsbUy9aa	GCSE dont so much matter, you need atleast 5 A*-Cs to get into a decent sixth form or college.<br>  <br>  From here you need to work hard in college or sixth form and get good A levels roughly C and above.<br>  <br>  This will help you get into a university because you need to go uni and get a teaching degree before you can become a teacher<br>  <br>  all the best of luck =D|`|GY97evsBaa	Around about 5 a*s - c's <br>  definatly maths and english language at least a c<br>  <br>  then some a-levels<br>  <br>  and then a degree (in any subject) which would mean a-level results which that university requires and a PCGE in primary school teaching<br>  <br>  OR an education degree, again a-levels at the requiredd level and subject of the university<br>  <br>  (:|`|7XqsUQ7Uaa	first study alpebets|`|QFf9phAmaa	your ability to make illiterate  child a literate one you should be a certificate holder i. e. you are educated enough.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	Graduation and some solid refrences if its gonna be a govt job

Hopefully she will understand & know that you tried hard & that next time you will do better. Don't let it get to you. You will do well on your next one. Best of luck.|`|nBaHzNbRaa	hey mom...i got a really low grade in math this quarter/semester and i just wanted to tell you that i will make sure itll go back up|`|NUqUcQCHaa	she dont need to kno|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Just tell her. The question is why were you expecting a good grade? Did you ask for help? It's not like there was one test and you got a bad grade. To fail a class requires effort.     You need to come clean. No excuses. You should have asked for help from the teacher and your classmates. You should have gone to your parents too.     Tell your mom that you realize your mistakes and will make every effort to get the help you need. It's all you can do.     You don't fail a class because of one grade. Highly unlikely.     There is a stumbling block and you need to try to figure where it is that you don't understand. Are you doing the homework? Are you having it corrected so you can see where your mistakes are?     I have a step daughter that claims to work hard but she doesn't. She's scattered and has other priorities. This is where I'm coming from.    I'm dyslexic and learn differently. I can do math. I have to really work at it. I have to ask for help. It's not easy. I know.     To get her to not be upset with you, you should be honest and have a plan for what you are going to do so it's not a pattern or a repeat.     You can do this! I didn't think I would graduate from college because I had a hard time in math. I got help from my instructor and the tutoring center - I went from failing math to making an A. Serious! I can do math. I had a block and once I found out where my block was (slope), it was all good.     Don't give up. Go back over your exam (if possible) to see where you went wrong.     Best of luck to you. Don't sell yourself short.|`|xtosLCS5aa	Okay first make sure she's in a calm mood then softly go uhhmm mom well I failed math. Then tell her that you can still pass the grade so it's not like if I failed math I would be held back mom .  I'm srry ,but that gots to suck because if you are in middle school you are going to have to end your elective and take the class again . So make sure you don't fail twice ok sweety because then you're going to have to summer school .

3BrCf1dBaa	I am homeschooled, have been since I was born! I love it, and I'm sure you will too. You will be able to do SO much more than if you were confined to a school room for almost the whole day. I finish my school work in about 3 hours, and score much higher on my annual  assessment tests than most of the public schooled students that take the same test. It is fantastic. Our family gets to go on long vacations and field trips, and if there's something we want to do on a certain day, we can take the day off and just do a little extra the next day! I'm fifteen now, and will be involved in dual enrollment when I'm sixteen at a community college, thereby combining my last two years of high school with my first two years of college. I work with horses a lot as well, and being able to do my school work whenever I want makes my schedule so much easier.   You'll love it!!|`|f3LqEOv9aa	i doubt anyone on here goes to WAMS and know what it even stands for,  youll get in,dont worry.
f3LqEOv9aa	well, i think its fine, but in my opinion;    kay, well, adult stem cells DONT always work the same way. theyre matured, so they dont always form into any cell, or any quanity, thus, embyronic are better. they have not yet formed\matured,so they can become whatever needed, without rejection.  and, its not killing a life. its an undeveloped fetus. it does not think, breath, live or do any actions human-like, therefore it cannot be considered human. its not comparable to human,and its if parents make the choice to abort the fetus, thats their choice. they can either discard it, or use it for research that can cure parkinsons, diabetes, spinal cord injuries,and other major diseases\disorder.  :)
SIhxrxD3aa	There are only 28 vet schools in the US and it's very competitive and difficult to get in.    You can find more info about those various schools here:  http://www.aavmc.org    The best place to go to vet school is in your home state if you're lucky enough to have a school in your state.  It's easier for you to be accepted at an in-state school and you'll also be paying a lot less    It takes about 6-8 years to become a vet.  2-4 years of undergraduate work, but it takes 90% of people 4 years.  Then 4 years of vet school.    The big thing you need to know is GET VETERINARY EXPERIENCE.  Even if you have to work for free for awhile.  The more experience you have the better your chances of being accepted.  Also, a recommendation from a veterinarian is required.  Call around to local clinics and ask if they'll let you shadow/volunteer or even if they have any job openings.  It'll also take good grades.  The average is about a 3.5 for those accepted.

23qVYh5Aaa	Is this an introduction paragraph for an essay? if so, you should mention the book you're referring to, not just the author.<br>  <br>  1) There are many texts in the book similar to things that happened in the real world.<br>  <br>  This can be rephrased to something like: The stories found in books are often a reflection of what reality holds. <br>  <br>  Ok So I tried my best to make it better from wha tyou provided:<br>  <br>   <br>  The stories found in books are often just a reflection of what reality holds.<br>  <br>  In the book [insert book title here], Haddix brings forth [the possible problem of the future], using historical references such as the “One-Child Policy” in China and how it could set off a mini-Holocaust.<br>  <br>  [It’d help your paragraph if you mention just what the possible problem of the future is]<br>  <br>   It [?Specify, The book?Haddix?]  addresses how a totalitarian government might take advantage of a food shortage to create such a law that would restrict families to “no more than two children.”<br>  <br>   As we see in the book, people are forced to forfeit their reproductive rights, such as when the government begins sterilizing women after Luke is born. <br>  <br>  In effect, parents must resort to hiding their children to keep them away from the population police and away from harm.<br>  <br>   Through this, Haddix addresses how a totalitarian government like this becomes corrupt by taking land away from people, not allowing them to eat certain food, taking away their income, and leaving them with little money. <br>  <br>  The people are left with a horrible life while the top officials or barons live richly and powerfully. <br>  <br>  The theme of the story is to make people aware of what America could be like if we are not careful.

KVkU6WSpaa	1) 16 / 14 = 40 / s      step 1: cross multiply to get: 16s = 40 x 14      step 2: simplify to: s = 35    2) 32 / t = 48 / 30      step 1: cross multiply to get: 48t = 32 x 30      step 2: simplify to: t = 20    3) 17 / y = 1/5      step 1: cross multiply to get: 1y = 17 x 5      step 2: simplify to: y = 85    4) 5 / 15 = 6 / 18    Hope this helps!
MX0sJGJxaa	first, you want to solve for y so it becomes a function to graph. so, subtract 9x from both sides, and your equation should be -2y = 18 - 9x. to put it in y = kx form, or slope intercept, it would be -2y = -9x +18. now you want a positive y, so divide everything by -1 to make -2y positive. your equation should be 2y = 9x - 18 OR 2y = 9x + -18. now to simplify 2y. divide everything by 2 and your equation should be y = 9/2x - 9 OR  y = 9/2x + -9. now graph the line. 9/2 is the slope and -9 is the y intercept, or where the function crosses the y-axis. find each point and see if it is on the line. the correct answer is D.|`|EevMUAqJaa	Just plug in the numbers until you find a solution. The first number in the ordered pair is your X, and the second is Y.|`|SxXIUBERaa	The question is asking you to find solutions for (x, y) in that order.  since the answer is already in front of you, you can just use trial and error.  For example, in answer a), if you put 0 in for x and 0 in for y, then the out come would be 9*0-2*0=18.  Now nine times zero is zero, minus zero is zero, so that doesn't work.  Answer a is out of the question.  If you continue like this, you'll find that answer d is the right answer.|`|5gqDqooDaa	For this problem, I would solve for y first. This gives you 9x/2-9=y. Then i would plug in x values. All three of these problems have 0, so plug in 0 and you get -9 :(0, -9) and that eliminates the wrong choices, so you get one possible answer which is D. Then plug in the other x values to see if they check out.|`|Pa8fGdUlaa	ok take the first group answer A and then plug it in to see if the numbers equal 18 (x,y) and you would take 9times 0-2times 0 and see if it equals 18 and do this with all 3 answers and see which ones work but remember that all of the three anwers in a group have to equal 18   i hope this helps good luck|`|EoaP3Lj7aa	the answer is D because u plug in the number into the X and Y spot and solve and they all should equal to 18 if,  if one dont equal 18 then the whole thing is wrong (0,9) 0 is the X and 9 is the Y
Dh0JX2Onaa	Local colleges give a vocational interest test. You should take it./|`|gg2aJXoDaa	Ok - I'd look at this in two stages -    1) a short term job that helps you identify what you want    2) your "dream job"    Job 1) might not sound important, but it really is. And if you're reasonably fit, and can swim - I'd strongly recommend doing your NPLQ. What's that, I hear you say? It's a qualification that will let you lifeguard. It's valid for two years, and accepted in the UK, Australia, Canada and America - It's something that is a great fall back, and getting a job at a council run leisure centre is realtivly easy. It's also very good pay up to 9 an hour in some places - Look into it for a job during 6th form. You get other duties to perform, and you get to meet lots of people your own age. And you get to check out the hotties that use the gym there. Plus, it keeps you in shape! A brilliant result all round.    However - I doubt very much it's what you want to do long term. If you like your music as much as you say you do, then you could a) try starting a band and hope you make it big. or b) go into the music technician side of things - that usually involes a 3 year course. Being a radio DJ is also quite popular at universities these days, but the competition for jobs is imense. My ex-flat mate was superb as a DJ, and he's only just managed to get work for a local BBC radio network. Behind the scenes.     Being a primary school teacher can be bloody tough. My uncle does it for a living and he keeps saying the kids are getting worse... Maybe that's just cynicism and old age creeping in. At any rate, I doubt you'd find it as fulfilling as challenging yourself with your music.    -a x    PS - If you really ARE serious about your music, I'd recommend trying to mix some stuff together by yourself, using the music software pacage fruitloops or something similar. Try putting your end result up online with a friend's drawings or animations - you never know who might see it and want to get in touch.|`|NbiMy9Fwaa	Have a look around on the internet and ask your careers teachers and get some books aswell from the library.

The couple were first cousins and married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 27. Some biographers have suggested that the couple's relationship was more like that between brother and sister than like husband and wife and that they never consummated their marriage.     Beginning in January 1842, she struggled with tuberculosis for several years. She died of the disease in January 1847 at the age of 24 in the family's cottage outside New York City.|`|XliM2cWaaa	Virginia Clemm died on January 30, 1847 at age 24 of tuberculosis.

It's a matter of finding the schools that fit your GPA, SATs, personal interests, and which are happy to admit students like you, who have promise, but maybe haven't performed as well as they could have. And there are plenty of colleges that would be glad to see you!     Just in my area, just to give you some examples, I'd have you look at perhaps Regis College, Wheelock College, Suffolk University, Southern New Hampshire University, Marymount Manhattan, Mercy College, Dominican College of Blauvelt, Georgian Court University, Framingham State College, SUNY Plattsburgh, Felician College, Adelphi University, and quite a few others.     You can use sites like www.collegeboard.com to find colleges that fit your stats, and also speak with your guidance counsellor to help you find schools that might fit you.|`|P59bsF5Haa	It's never to late.

Onest for honest<br>       An hour ...... sounds like.............an Our<br>      unique........ sounds like.........   yuneek therefore......... A unique<br>  <br>  the beginning of all these words sound like (a,e,i,o,u)|`|vY0ScgeXaa	An unique girl.<br>  <br>  A E I O U needs to be used after an "AN"|`|ZDFP11leaa	A Biography of a Unique Girl|`|9794VMZ9aa	It's actually 'A Unique Girl'. <br>  I asked my English teacher once. I forgot what the explantion was though... doh! I think it's because the sound of the 'u' in unique isn't like 'uh', it's more like 'you'.<br>  Therefore it's treated more like a constanant, because 'unique' sounds like it should be spelt 'younique'.|`|8f2e6b2b77e98982ec1a14639f6d0a1baa	A Biography of A Unique Girl<br>  <br>  AN is grammatically incorrect.

Because 'U' is a vowel(a, e, i, o, u)|`|nvNDGP66aa	It should be "A Biography of A Unique Girl". U sounds like "you", and its Y , so it will be "A".

uX5hO3d8aa	It's a bad time to invest and a bad time to waste college loan money.    Don't be dumb, send it back. College loans interest rates compound like crazy once you graduate so that $900 now can end up costing you thousands in a few years.    And listen to your mother. When she co-signed your loan, she was given as much authority over the money as you were. You could not have gotten that loan without her and if she chose, she could have the loans canceled altogether.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Uh...does it not specify in the loan agreement that you promise not to use the money for anything other than school?  The stock market is nothing more than glorified gambling, and while I love to gamble as much as the next person, I use my own money to do so.    It might be flat-out illegal to keep it although it's unlike anyone will try to prove that, but if you have any sort of conscience, you'd pay it back.  Someone else wants an education and could use that money!|`|AA11095087	Even if her name is not on the check, since she co-signed the loan, she does have a say in what you do with it.  (And she *is* your mother.)    Given how much the stock market is gyrating just now, the safe thing to do would be to return it to the loan company so that you have less debt (and less interest to pay) when you finish school.|`|YCICrIKyaa	NIU?

AA11604732	I don't really understand how the whole A-Levels thing works -- but ask yourself if your grades are good enough to get into Oxford or Cambridge.

UCLA will be harder for you to get into -- because 95% of those they accept are from California.|`|AA10023710	You're taking the right A levels for MIT, UCLA and Stanford.

AA10023710	Schools usually have specific ways of letting you know they are closed due to weather. For example, specific radio stations, or via the school's website, etc. When your school does reopen, you need to find out where you're supposed to look to know if the school is closed.     A school won't tell you it's open. It'll only tell you it's closed. So they won't tell you they've reopened. They are open unless they tell you otherwise.

I'm unaware of any college that has a better reputation than another in that field, but someone who works in psychology would know better than I would.    As for applying to a US school: every US college and university has its own procedure, but here's basically what you need to do:    1) Complete an application (you can often find this at the colleges' website).  More information: http://www.universitylanguage.com/guides...    2) Take standardized tests, such as the ACT or SAT. These are offered around the world.  More information: http://www.universitylanguage.com/guides...    3) If English isn't your native language, you may have to take the TOEFL.

You aren't doing as well as your parents would like, and by the looks of things, you aren't going to start anytime soon. Swallow your pride and take the help being offered, or just keep being yelled at until they do something worse.    Maybe you don't need it in the future. Right now you do - if you want to get a better grade and stop being yelled at, that is. You can hate it all you want, but if you're getting a better grade and your parents aren't upset, that's just fine.    Get help.|`|AA11404742	Chloe, what would it take to get you to get over your pride or your "ego thing" and apply yourself to this?  Surely you're not saying that you're proud to be too dumb to understand math...  are you?    People can still learn, even kids in school.  It's going on all around you.      Take charge of your education.  Take ownership of it.  If you don't understand something in class, SPEAK UP.  Ask questions, ask for another explanation.      Your parents want you to succeed.  Don't you want to, also?    edit - and if this isn't enough to convince you to try this, consider this:    If you don't understand math, people will cheat you later on when they find out.  They'll cheat you in taxes, in paychecks, in hours worked, and in other ways.  It's worth your time to learn this - honest.    edit - the more advanced stuff is partly to teach you a rational and logical approach to life.  If you can learn to apply the tools they teach here, you can learn to apply other tools in other subjects.  And you can use some of these techniques and tools in those subjects, too.  Don't give up!    Besides, if you go on to college, you WILL see this stuff again.  So learning it now will make it easier for you then.  And it will save you some money, too.  In high school, you're not paying for classes by the credit hour.  In college, you may pay several hundred dollars per class.  Flunk it there, and you will pay several hundred dollars again to try to relearn it.  Would you rather have that money in your pocket, or spend it over and over on a class?|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I'm betting that you could do better if you would get past your insecurity that you just aren't good at math. That and a little extra study.     What level math are you in anyways?    EDIT  Whether you will need the math in the future depends on what you plan to do with your life. But even if you're just going to be a waitress, you may use some basic Algebra concepts in a variety of different ways. But whether you actually use the math or not, it will help you have a better understanding of the world.    The main reason your parents keep pushing you is because they don't want you to fail at something you may need in life. At the very least, if you go to college, you'll need to understand this stuff for the math classes you have to take in college.|`|PT1NJVfKaa	I was in your situation, I was terrible at math, my dad wouldn't let me drop the course, I was failing miserably in advanced functions grade 12 and sat down and had a good talk with him. I told him how I felt about Math, and how I wouldn't need this course for a prerequisite for university, as I wanted to go into history. He still insisted I take math and sciences as I would need them. One day after a 39 on a math test I came home to my mom really angry, and just told her everything. I guess my mom told my father how much I was struggling, and he came up and signed the papers to drop the course and told me how sorry he was and was unaware of my distress. I was like you 90 in every other courses but just didn't get math, talk to your parents, don't let them leave tell your done, let them know exactly how you feel. As long as you aren't going into something in college or university that requires a certain math course, you should be fine. Depending what level your at, you might want to stick with it and try as hard as you can, if you are in your senior years and no longer need it, that's when you can let it go. And there is nothing wrong with getting extra help, I too didn't like to go to extra help, but I found it help me a lot during my junior years.  Good Luck|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Get over yourself already. Seriously we all need help in something. Your pride is going to hurt you. If you don't believe me then go down this path and see where it leads. I warn you though. Don't sell yourself short.     Get the help. It's most likely a stumbling block that keeps tripping you. That was my issue. Once I got past it through help from my instructor and a tutor - I was able to excel and I enjoyed math.     You might not need help anymore once you get past your block. I didn't. But you may not be as lucky. I don't know.     But you must seek help. Math is very important. You can do it.     Pride is a dangerous thing. I know some proud poor people. They have a very dysfunctional family because of it. There is so much fighting and stupidity. It's over stupid pride. It's not worth it because life is short and moves fast.    You need algebra. You can do it. Just find your block. Ask questions. Learn from your mistakes. Follow the rules.    Don't give up. You are too young with too much potential. Just do your best. But you aren't trying your best. Get help. It's ok. Smart people get help. The rest muddle through. The rest don't get anywhere.    Ok. Maybe not but you need it now. What if you decide you want to go into engineering or pharmacy or become a doctor? There is logic in math. There are rules to follow. You may not use the exact skill set but you will use a method.     I had trouble in math. I'm telling you that you must just get the help. It can be more enjoyable. Isn't it worth a little effort on your part so you don't hate it? That's what I didn't see until I got to college. I aced math in college. I aced it when I got the help I needed.    You are young and don't know if you will need it or not. You don't know when it might come in handy. There are a lot of areas of study that use high level math that pay very well and have a great future.

p8LB7EMcaa	for improving your concentration, the first step to follow is to tell yourself firmly that you have to study and study hard, come whatever may. Once you understand one concept, quickly write in down. make notes while reading a lesson. Another very helpful tip is, that once you finish your studies for the day, revise what you learnt after 24 hours. then revise the same thing after 1 week, then 1 month and so on. the was for your concentration problem.<br>  you are an engineering student, and fearing new people will take you nowhere. dont think the hell about what others will think of you. if they think bad about you, its their problem. you simply tell yourself "i am the best person walking around". sit with guests who come to your home. reward yourself every time you interact with a new person. share your feelings and thoughts with people you trust. if something disturbs u, vomit out your emotions..if u dont hate some1, flush his photo in d toilet..such small things really get u out of d shell..they help in increasing your confidence level.and yes, the most important, ,make as many as new frnz as u can.

2zkcZNx0aa	Thanks to the invention of Rudolph Diesel, the diesel engine has proved to be extremely efficient and cost effective.  Diesel fuel is priced moderately higher than gasoline but diesel has a higher energy density, i.e. more energy can be extracted from diesel as compared with the same volume of gasoline. Therefore, diesel engines in automobiles provide higher mileage, making it an obvious choice for heavy-duty transportation and equipment. Diesel is heavier and oilier compared with gasoline, and has a boiling point higher than that of water.  And diesel engines are attracting greater attention due to higher efficiency and cost effectiveness. <br>  Diesel fuel has approximately 18% more energy per unit of volume than gasoline. It also takes less refining to make diesel. In addition, diesel engines are actually more efficient than gasoline engines. As a result, people with diesel engines enjoy better gas mileage. <br>  <br>  On the negative side, diesel contains more particulates (particles of soot) than gasoline, which cause smog. And it goes without saying that diesel-friendly stations aren't nearly as common as those that pump ol' 87 octane. <br>  <br>  couldnt you change the wording of the debate slightly to diesel should be used more commonly that any other fuel for vehicles?|`|o8o689x5aa	Actually, diesel is only used in SOME vehicles (that are not class 8, big rigs). LPG does not have the same energy per gallon as gasoline or diesel does, so you'd use more of it, i.e. MPG would be less. Also, technology has gotten to the point that small diesel engines, used in cars, have less of an environmental imprint than gasoline engines because they're more efficient. Volkswagen is coming out with a sports car that has a 2.0 liter turbo-diesel, goes from 0-60 in 6.2 seconds, and gets 35mpg in the city and 50mpg on the highway.

If so, then before you do anything, find out which choice would benefit you the most re: being able to obtain a work visa in Australia. <br>  <br>  In some countries - I don't know about AU - if you do a degree in that country, especially in certain subjects, it helps with your ability to get a visa to work and live there. If that's the case for AU, then the investment you make in an AU degree might be worth it, because it will help in the visa process. <br>  <br>  If you do decide that going to uni in Sweden is the best thing, then I'd suggest the following:<br>  - Do a degree in Sweden that allows you to do a foreign exchange as part of your studies, and do that exchange in Australia. In this way, you will get exposure to living in AU while you do your degree, and it will help you decide if you really do want to work there once you graduate. It'll also help you make connections there. <br>  - Considering doing your course/major/field of study in a field in which AU is actively seeking immigrants. If you graduate with an in-demand degree, it can help ease your immigration process. <br>  - If you decide to go on for a masters degree, consider doing that in AU.|`|B5xrYsuxaa	im assuming you have been to Australia and love it, otherwise, I suggest visiting first..last thing you wanna do is get roped up in tons of school debt and you end up hating the place too

Most employers regard them courses alot higher than art or drama as they see it in "most" jobs it isnt anything that will actively help you and show you can further yourself.

Ask for a meeting with your connections advisor if you have one if not then with your form tutor to discuss your best options and also what you want to do for when you leave school as certain courses means you will find it easier to get into work once your finished schooling.

oO4TUkVkaa	My husband is an avid hunter.  The veiw point of our family is the fact that there is an overpopulation of deer in the woods near our home.  I rather see people eat these deer and keep the population down than have them die of starvation over the winter.  Besides overpopulation it keeps the number of deer that get killed from being hit by cars down.  Deer being hit by cars is a big problem for both the deer and the cars owner.  We also eat the meat.  Deer meat is actually alot less fatty than beef and can be used in any recipe calling for ground beef.  It also cost alot less. A whole deer can be butchered for like $80.  A cow can cost as much as $1800.|`|uni2m4Mlaa	A couple of the arguments hunters put forth (and I happen to think they are powerful arguments) are....hunting "culls" the herds.  Meaning, without the animal deaths caused by deer hunters, for ex, many deer would starve to death each winter.  This would be because the deer population would be too large for the limited forage available.  Another arugument is that hunting is very regulated and taxed.  The money from hunting licences goes toward our conservation projects.  Meaning trying to keep lands and wetlands natural habitats for our animal population.  And in many cases fighting against land development which would displace or cut down the animal population.  A third argument is that for many, huniting is a fantastic opportunity for fathers and sons (tradionally, but of course mothers and daughters as well) to bond and become close.|`|1e9837b90fb6cd2da8f7ba59782f65a1aa	I am for the humane removal of excess animals from the environment.

tdJuvdeXaa	It could be about a young girl growing up in Ethiopia or some other country in Africa with extreme hunger problems, and another, very wealthy girl of the same age in a more developed country. The 2 could become pen pals, and the richer girl could start to help the poor one (sending her packages of food, farming equipment). I don't know exactly what might happen next, but maybe the poor girl could start doing the same thing for starving people around her. OR she could discover that the rich girl has problems of her own (divorce, etc.) and then IDK.

AA10023710	Know that it may or may not be possible for you to stay at the same school for pre-med and med. Med schools consciously try not to admit too many students from their undergraduate programs. Your having gone there as an undergrad may give you no advantage re: grad school.<br>  <br>  The exception is if you're able to get one of the few available places in a BS/MD program, like the one offered by Johns Hopkins. There are only about six students per year accepted, but if you are accepted, you go there for 3 years for your undergrad coursework, and if you do well, you go immediately into the med school. It's worth looking into. <br>  <br>  Some great science programs exist at colleges nearish you, and if your SATs end up being strong enough, based on your grades and current coursework, I'd have you look at: Johns Hopkins, SUNY Stony Brook (a very strong science school, a top 100 US university, and a SUNY), MIT, Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Princeton, Columbia, Holy Cross, U Penn, Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Penn State University Park, Brandeis, Rutgers New Brunswick, U Maryland College Park, Yeshiva U, NYU, UMass Amherst, U Conn, Boston College, Mt. Holyoke, Tufts, Bard, Vassar, Smith, Bryn Mawr, Fordham, Wellesley, Swarthmore, Amherst, Williams. <br>  <br>  I expanded your "two hours driving" to three hours, I'm afraid, because I really wanted to get Johns Hopkins on there. Likewise, Holy Cross, because they do such a good job getting students into med school. And then I stuck CM on there, which is more than three hours, because they're such a good science school. And to be honest, there aren't that many awesome schools very near LI. Those that are great are really great, but... the rest? Are okay. Good. Fine. But you can get into better. <br>  <br>  It's not the case that all of the schools I listed have med schools. If that's very important to you, then you can check each one to find the ones that have med schools, and focus on those.|`|b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	Consider going to community college first, then transferring to university.

I would also recommend Cornell, both a challenging and great school.<br>  <br>  I would definitely put Cornell and NYU on your watch list since they are both high profile and Cornell is Ivy League and will probably offer a pretty good scholarship to those who have good grades!
92VH41EZaa	11. I'd say it means something along the lines of... when we're good to ourselves and take care of our own responsibilities we have more time and care for others, so we treat them better and obviously (hopefully) if you treat someone well they'll treat you back in the same way. So we have to love ourselves before we can truly love anybody else.<br>  <br>  12. .. erm not sure on that one, sorry<br>  <br>  13. i think silence means peace so.. if we all took a time out of our busy lifestyles and relaxed without distraction, we'd get to know ourselves better. a bit like "me time" haha.

6mKm3iQ4aa	If there really aren't any sentences that you can cut, look for ways to condense what you're saying.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say generically, but I'm sure there are some sentences that could be condensed.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you're saying, "The dog ran through the yard, spotted the cat and proceeded to chase her up into the tree," you might simplify your statement.  Possibly, "The dog chased the cat into the tree."<br>  <br>  Email your essay to me and I'll work on it this morning...  If you want to.|`|SYkzZtW7aa	You need a second person to do some ruthless editing. You won't be able to (at least in the short term) because you're too close to it.<br>  <br>  You might even try giving it to someone who has little/no knowledge of the subject. Is the writing clear?<br>  <br>  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––
NbmnWwqEaa	Ask him out . . . on a real life, in person, date.<br>  Make it a social thing with other people around . . . skating, bowling or something like that.<br>  <br>  Ask him if he likes you!<br>  Write him a note and say you like him and wonder if there's any chance he might like you back?<br>  <br>  Why do you want "tricks" when you can have facts?
sjOelwhhaa	Independent clauses are those that can stand alone as  sentences.  Dependent clauses are part of a sentence that also has at least one independent clause.  Here is an example of an independent clause: I ate dinner.  You can add a dependent clause:  I ate dinner when I got home.  "When I got home" is dependent.  There are many other types of dependent clauses; I just gave you a simple one.<br>  <br>  Contractions are words like "don't," I'm," wouldn't," etc.  The apostrophe takes the place of an omitted letter.<br>  <br>  "Possive" is, I'm assuming, passive.  The passive is a choice we make when we don't want to say (or no one cares)  who did something.  Instead of saying, "Mr. Smith made a mistake." we can put it in the passive voice and say, "A mistake was made."  English teachers often advise against the use of the passive in essays; it gets annoying because some people use the passive instead of thinking critically.  Most readers admire sentences in the active voice although the passive is used by everyone, every day.

mYhuGonfaa	The best tool you can use for comparative essays is a visual model. You could use a venn diagram, web of some sort, outline, etc. It's important that students learn to organize their ideas before putting them into an essay format. This part will also lead to stronger ideas and a very organized and flowing piece of writing.|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	The same way I teach all essay writing:<br>  I break it down into the essay stages - info-gathering, sorting & selecting etc<br>  Then I move onto looking at the introduction, then the body etc<br>  I produce a worksheet that gives students good and bad examples of essay style and I go through (step by step) a mini essay on the board.  <br>  I drum into them how to structure and how to signpost.<br>  It isn't something you can teach in an hour, so you have to plan.<br>  You can break it up by giving them homework tasks, where the students have to prepare a plan.  They can discuss this in groups or you can try and see each plan individually for 2-3 mins.<br>  Keep the examples light if you can and add a bit of humour.<br>  Just present essay writing as a skill that can be learnt.  I am aware that some people have a natural talent for good self-expression but for the benefit of those in your class who don't, they will benefit from you giving them a model answer and examples that they can adapt and re-write to fit their own essay.

xfpJGBfwaa	I understand the IT part, I think, it's computers, right?  But is it programming or is it computer repair?  or is it electrical engineering?  I don't understand the part about "B. Tech" what does B. stand for?  <br>  <br>  Since I have done both repairs and programming, I can give ideas about that.  <br>  <br>  Classic programming projects have been about making games.  Since you're in India, how about Parcheesi?  In the USA, I've been asked to do Craps and other Casino games as part of college level programming projects.  Usually in the last year of USA college, you write an operating system program, but it's usually just a simulator.  If you're focused on a programming career, then the most important thing you can explore is the Windows API.  Even at a low level you can write a simple program that uses the API - for example, to activate the screensaver after a period of time, or on demand.  Or to test the battery life of a laptop.  <br>  <br>  I've never taken formal training in repairs, but I've done it professionally.  One of the things I am interested in professionally is the research time that people spend on a problem before they begin work.  I mean, what is the most efficient research method?  How much time does it take to answer a basic question about this or that machine?  Is it easier to answer on a Dell?  Acer?  HP?  <br>  <br>  Another thing is to discover how jargon heavy you have to be to communicate clearly with people about computers and computer problems?  Do we need to educate every person we help on things like "What is a title bar, a message box (versus dialog box), etc?"  Does it take much extra time to simply skip the explanation and try to communicate at the user's experience level?  Or not?  <br>  <br>  I haven't studied or worked in EE, but I do know that PIC devices are commonly used as project foci at USA colleges.  And that manufacturing of chips is becoming more standardized, to the point where it's becoming difficult to find someone who'll make a specialized chip for you - because almost nobody spends the money on maintaining the equipment anymore.  Beyond that, hopefully someone else will answer.|`|4Ys7Sr9caa	Since you are doing your 2nd year why don't you start with the basics.....Say something like the Digital Clock or the more complex Line following robot are good to start with !

Instead ask her for a conference with your Mom or Dad attending, to discuss how you can bring up your grade.Or just yourself if you are confident enough. You might be surprised, it might be some little thing, that you need to correct to get a better grade. And your teacher will know you are serious about your classes.<br>  I had a gym teacher that consistently graded me in the c's when I knew I was doing all I could in her class.I asked the reason and it turned out, I could not ever make a basket.

The battle between States Rights Vs. Federal Rights was the whole point of the United States Civil War.|`|pYtnOnbDaa	It is an irony of history that the name "America" did not come from Christopher Columbus. That distinction belongs to a German writer of geography. <br>  <br>  In a further twist of events, America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, a 15th century Florentine merchant who owned a business in Seville, Spain, furnishing supplies for ships, preparing them for mercantile expeditions. <br>  <br>  How do we explain what seems to mock the reality of history? <br>  <br>  Stirred by the achievements of Columbus and envious of the reputation his discoveries brought, Vespucci endeavored to cultivate Columbus' friendship and trust. <br>  <br>  Seven years after Columbus' first voyage and while Columbus was still alive, Vespucci accompanied an expedition that consisted of four ships. They sailed past the eastern coast of South America, and visited Trinidad, which Columbus had named the preceding year. On his return to Europe Vespucci wrote letters with glowing descriptions of the newly discovered countries. He called the lands he had visited a "New World." <br>  <br>  Some years later Vespucci's letters were published and read by Martin Waldseemuller, a noted geographer, and Mathias Ringmann, a schoolmaster. Recently arrived from Germany to the province of Lorraine, they were attracted to the town of Saint-Die because of a newly established print shop. Both men were engaged in working on a reproduction of Ptolemy's treatise on geography, to which they were adding a preface. <br>  <br>  After reading the account of Vespucci's travels in "Quatre Navigations d' Americ Vespuce," they decided to incorporate Vespucci's voyage into the treatise. Ringmann, acting as editor, wrote in his introduction: <br>  <br>  "There is a fourth quarter of the world which Amerigo Vespucci has discovered and which for this reason we can call 'America' or the land of Americo." <br>  <br>  Apparently ignorant of the discoveries and achievements made by Columbus fifteen years earlier, Ringmann continued: <br>  <br>  "We do not see why the name of the man of genius, Amerigo, who has discovered them, should not be given to these lands, as Europe and Asia have adopted the names of women." <br>  <br>  Their work was published on April 25, 1507 under the title "Cosmographiae Introductio." It marked the first time the word AMERICA appeared in print.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	1507 when it was mapped out, named after amerigo vespucci.

NCZK0QyGaa	I found this Information on a PeachTree Blog:<br>  <br>  The problem is caused by one maintenance record being used in thousands of transactions.<br>  <br>  Lets say, you have a Customer that you invoice for tons of transactions. At some point you will see your system slowing down, and over time it will just stop responding when clicking the save button.<br>  <br>  It appears that Peachtree has a problem with this. We assume it is because of the recalculating of balances and such, and at some point it just gets lost. It may happen with sales invoices, applying receipts, purchases, cash disbursements or actually any type of transaction.<br>  <br>  It may happen with any type of maintenance record item, such as customers, vendors and inventory items. So you ask, what can I do about it? Well there are a couple of work arounds.<br>  <br>     1. Purge your Peachtree Data<br>     2. Create a new ID for the maintenance record that is giving you trouble and start using that new ID.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you are just stuck, because the customer may have open transactions that need payments applied and you cannot apply them. At this point you will need to send your Peachtree data to us for our scrubbing service.

It was a time when every person dreamed of a warm place to stay where they didn't need to worry about their next meal. A place where they all wished they had monely left over to buy that new album, a necklace at the mall, or maybe just a better brand of coffee at the grocery. But beyond the unreachable dreams, there were nightmares. Allan was tortured repeatedly, and nightmares became so frequent he was almost certain that the things he dreamed of were actually real. Allan was confused by his real life and his nightmares; he often talked to people at the bar about things that only happened in his dreams, and those people thought of him as either mentally ill or too drunk. It was weird how people could become so out of place in society when unemployed. Finding a job was becoming a job itself. Allan was always waking up at the same time each morning, returning with disappointment on the same subway each night. There was no connection between one day and the next. He even lost track of the date...was it January, February, or maybe December? He sat on the stairs in the subway tunnel alone on this silent night, listening to the angelic voices of children as they performed Christmas carols above in the public park. Tears rolled down his scarred cheeks as he remembered his childhood, never having to care about not saving enough money to pay next month's rent, never having to compare prices over and over again in the supermarket and making budgets. Allan opened the bottle cap and gulped down another bottle of beer. He knew he was breaking his own rules on no drinking but that was the only way for him to escape his hard life. He was ashamed of himself for not meeting his own standards. Allan was a lawyer, and though he had graduated three years ago, he had absolutely no experience because he had never found a job. Now Allan relies on sleeping pills to fall into a deep, undisturbed sleep but each morning he wakes up restlessly by his heart pounding in his chest, and he thinks, "Maybe today is the day that I've been waiting for, maybe today I will find a job," and that was what kept his head up and looking forward to tomorrow. Each time he was turned down. Each time he heard the pity in their voice and saw their sympathetic eyes, he would feel a pang of anger arousing from within. It made his mind scream, "DO NOT LOOK AT ME LIKE I AM SOME KIND OF DIRTY SAVAGE." But all he could manage each time was a hopeless whisper and a forced, broken smile. Allan slumped down the stairs and pushed the broken door to the harsh world, his world. He saw all kinds of people lingering around the streets, rummaging for meals with vacant hearts and empty stomachs...and he was no different. He would find himself staring up at the broken windows on 66th Street for some breakfast in the early morning and watching the war-filled newspapers flow down Second Avenue for dinner. There was nothing left for him. The cold city was a place for the wealthy people, and there would never be a place for him in this society. He was blinded by the street lights and tricked by society's winners. Pursuing happiness would never be an option for him.|`|O7QyQl15aa	He was depressed just like every other man when the economy collapsed on them. <br>  <br>  It was a time when every person dreamed of a warm place to stay where they didn't need to worry about their next meal. A place where they all wished they had money left over to buy that new album, a necklace at the mall, or maybe just a better brand of coffee at the grocery. Beyond the unreachable clouds of joyful dreams, there were nightmares. <br>  <br>  Allan was tortured repeatedly in his nightmares, and they have become so frequent he was almost certain that the things he dreamed of was actually reality. <br>  <br>  Allan was confused by his real life and his nightmares; he often talked to people at the bar about things that only happened in his dreams. Those people thought of him as either mentally ill or simply drunk. It was weird how people could become so out of place in society without a job. Finding a job was becoming a job itself. He was always waking up at the same time each morning, returning with disappointment on the same subway each night. There was no connection between one day and the next. He even lost track of the date...was it January, February, or maybe December? He sat on the stairs in the subway tunnel alone on Silent Night, listening to the angelic voices of children as they performed christmas carols above in the public park. Tears rolled down his scarred cheeks as he remembered his childhood. Never having to care about not saving enough money to pay next week's taxes.  Never had to compare prices over and over again in the supermarket and making budgets. <br>  <br>  Allan opened the bottle cap and gulped down another bottle of beer. He knew he was breaking his own rules on no drinking, but that was the only way for him to escape his hard life. He was ashamed of himself for not meeting up to his own standards. Graduated from law school three years ago, he had absolutely no experience as he had never found a job. <br>  <br>  Allan relies on sleeping pills to fall into a deep, undisturbed sleep, but each morning he wakes up restlessly by his heart pounding against his chest, and he thinks, "maybe today is the day that I've been waiting for, maybe today I will find a job", and that was what kept his head up and looking forward to tomorrow. Each time the boss turned him down. Each time he heard the pity in their voice and saw their sympathetic eyes, he would feel a pang of anger arousing from within. It made his mind scream, "DO NOT LOOK AT ME LIKE I AM SOME KIND OF DIRTY SAVAGE". But all he could manage each time was a hopeless whisper and a forced, broken smile. Allan slumped down the stairs and pushed the broken door to the harsh world, his world. <br>  <br>  He saw all kinds of people lingering around the streets, rummaging for meals with vacant hearts and empty stomachs...and he was no different. He would find himself staring up at the broken windows on 66th street for some breakfast in the early morning and watching the war-filled newspapers flow down second avenue for dinner. There was nothing left for him. The cold city was a place for the wealthy people. There will never be a place for him in this society. He was blinded by the street lights and tricked by society's winners. Pursuiting happiness will never be an option for him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Its really good, have added full stops as think it gives it more depression and statement.  Hope this helps!
TRrEA2E5aa	It's great, the only thing is the way you spelled the third word in the second sentence. :) It's 'barely' so just fix that, and it's great! :)|`|d331e25a3bf2fa5d4adc840b4fb3276caa	Starting with "and" or "but" is technically okay. Schools teach you it's not because it's difficult to use properly. But they can be used wonderfully as a source of personal style. For example, "I was trying to finish my homework, but then the doorbell rang. And the dog barked. And the baby cried. And the laundry buzzed." You get the point. Yes, I studied English education and we talked a lot about how the writing rules they teach you in 7th grade are very often wrong.<br>  <br>  The problem is that those wrong rules are so often taught, that I've had many college professors that don't know any better. (Oh, I always got in trouble for ending with a preposition. Who cares? Language is meant to communicate. Did I communicate clearly and effectively, or are you just following some stupid rule you heard of years ago?) Anyway, my point is, some times you have to play the teachers game. In this case, I don't think you lose much by changing "and" to "then" but it's entirely writer's choice.|`|5vue0eW8aa	PEOPLE- THIS IN NOT AN OPINION- IT'S A FACT!!!!  You CAN start a sentence with the word "and". Your high school english teachers are not going to teach this concept to you- however, it's fine to do.<br>  <br>  this guy says it best read on (sorry for the long post) :<br>  <br>  It is perfectly acceptable to start this sentence with But even tough it is a part of FANBOYS -for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so- I can start a sentence with it because of the usage to coordinate two independent clauses (groups of words that can stand alone as sentences). Here are two examples, with the independent clauses in brackets: [We started to go home], but [we had run out of gas]. Most likely, many people believe they should not start a sentence with a coordinating conjunction because their grammar teachers in grade school discouraged them from doing so. Yet such a rule is completely unjustifiable. When grammar teachers teach youngsters the essentials of sentence structure, they most likely explain that coordinating conjunctions are used to hold together elements within a sentence. Therefore, they may discourage students from starting sentences with coordinating conjunctions because they are trying not only to explain conjunctions but also to help their students learn to avoid sentence fragments like this one: She was a nice girl. And smart, too. In this example, using "and" after the period is wrong because the second "sentence" is not really a sentence at all: it has neither a subject nor a verb. Thus, youngsters carry forward into adulthood the notion that a sentence should never begin with a coordinating conjunction, especially not with "and" or "but." In fact, however, professional writers have started sentences with coordinating conjunctions throughout history|`|3tnVVFjHaa	so i decided to answer it.|`|AULn9uPYaa	Sorry to tell you, it is not 'proper english' to start a sentence with 'And". <br>  Although, I have done it for effect, so it will depend on your teacher!|`|6WxsrIusaa	You can get away with starting a sentence with "And" IF it flows (is not clunky, stilted, awkward) AND the rest of your writing is masterful:  no spelling/grammar mistakes, solid, smooth style, etc.  You would need to be EXTREMELY confident that your writing is consistently strong.  If not, don't do it.  This is a stylistic liberty that is best left to the most accomplished writers.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Starting with "and" is a dangerous business.

Could this problem be the result of acting out?- Or is the teacher wrong?|`|dj00wdjKaa	You have to ask your daughter why she thinks she got a C and if she thinks she deserved that grade based on what she did. Did something go wrong when she was doing her art? May be now that you're going to see her teacher you can try to look at other student's art projects to see if your daughter didn't step up to her other classmates' art work or if the teacher really didn't get what her art was about.
v5SXqxo0aa	First, get straight A's. No mess ups freshman year, because school will only get harder. You want a 3.8+ unweighted, so save potential B's for AP classes (which you should take at least 8 of). Also get a 2250+ on your SAT, and 720+ on your SAT IIs.<br>  <br>  I hope you already have two passions that you've participated in for a long time. This could be girl scouts, cello, soccer, whatever as long as you've done it for multiple years. In high school, you should continue the passions to the upper reaches. For example, if you run, organize a race for cancer research or orphanges or whatever you are passionate about. If you are in Key Club, become a national officer in the organization. If you are violinist, play in premier youth symphonies like the San Fransisco Youth Symphony.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, spread your talent to the less fortunate. If you play violin, volunteer to create an one hour after school club where you teach violin at a school without a music program.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pBRN4xxTaa	get ready to eat rocks!|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I home study in cell

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It's not legal to teach ID in the science classroom - every time it was actually put into the state science standards in some form it's been shot down in the courts.  And evolution is in all state science standards.  But that doesn't mean evolution is actually being taught, and ID/creationism is not.  Many teachers just skip over it altogether to avoid arguments.  Yeah, it's pretty much 'god did it' with a little bit of hellfire thrown in just in case they didn't really believe that.  Although a prof at my university has been teaching an 'evolution and creationism' class for a few years now which focuses on the controversy, and he's found that including ID and refuting it without dissing religion in general results in the students having a better understanding of how evolution actually works and science in general - but of course, that's on the college level.

8yE2sYGeaa	Sure, it's unfair, but unles the students rise en masse to complain aobuthte situation, the university will do whis until it gets caught, then feign ignorance|`|hyHvG1Olaa	There are several questions here that need to be addressed but first there needs to be an understanding as to what a professor is and what s/he does.  Many students who enter college assume the professor is “all knowing” and this is not always true.<br>  <br>  To complete a doctorate degree one must be an expert in one aspect of an area.  Consider the individual who has a doctorate in history, his dissertation might be on the effect of the decrease in rainfall over time on the agro-economy of the Indians of the upper Amazon rainforest.  So, do you really expect him to know everything about United States History if he is asked as the newby on the block to teach undergraduates.  Each professor is expected to teach classes and the newest individuals get stuck with the lowest classes, in this case Freshman level United States History.<br>  <br>  As professors go up in their levels and gain tenure (usually at 5 – 10 years) they then teach increasing numbers of upper level courses nearer their areas of expertise.  It is all part of the learning curve.  If you think back to your days in elementary and secondary schools there were newby teachers there also and they usually had to teach the lowest level of student and classes.  It is the same at the college level.<br>  <br>  The INS records are your responsibility to follow up on not the responsibility of the Registrar’s Office.  So stop complaining and call the appropriate INS office to find out where the documents are and what the reason for the hold up is concerning them.<br>  <br>  On a personal note it sounds as if you expect others to do everything for you.  You are in college and as such you and only you are responsible for your education and your future.  Please stop trying to blame others for your short-comings.  Sorry about coming on so strong but I think you need a wake-up call.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	The INS problem can't be solved by your university no matter how many times they call as the INS is backed up and will catch up soon.  As far as professors go everybody has to start someplace, but there is no excuse for a teacher who doesn't have the knowledge nor the skills to teach  Maybe you could get other students involved and talk to the University about the problem. This is serious because there are many students who's primary way of learning is what is said in class vs. the textbook. There are different ways of learning and they are making it extremely difficult. This should not be happening.  Have you considered changing to another University?|`|ygGr1nX7aa	On the other hand, a big part of the University experience is independant research and learning, and how else are new professors going to gain experience?  Everyone has to start somewhere.<br>  <br>  As for the aid, you said it yourself- the uni has no control over the situation.  Nor is it THEIR responsibility to chase YOUR paperwork- if you want it followed up, why not call yourself?|`|3iuTzYGXaa	Erm exactly how else is the professor expected to gain experience if nobody gives them a teaching position.  A lack of teaching experience does not translate to lack of passion or understanding. There are good and bad teachers regardless of experience, sounds like you got a bad one.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	Let me ask you? How would they go about getting "experience" apart from actually getting a job at a college? You can do practicums until your a** falls off, but you don't get true experience until you're in the job.<br>  <br>  That being said, how do you know your professor is inexperienced and not just a really bad teacher? <br>  <br>  The issue with the documents is that you're going to a school with a lot of people. I'm sorry, but you're NOT the most important person there. They're not going to drop everything they do just to make sure everything is hunky-dory for you. YOU take the responsibility and follow up on it if it bothers you that much.<br>  <br>  Not irrelevant. Just sounds like you don't like what you're hearing and wanting someone to sympathize with you. So pathetic.

9m9gHZhpaa	Every high school senior likes to party in their few last months of high school (,) and do not think about consequences that may result. I(')m sure that every one of those high school seniors have been advised many times by their parents in order to prevent bad things from happening, many of them do listen and many of them do not. I was once one of these high school seniors. When I was 17, in 2003; I use(d) to love going out to parties, clubs, and loved driving around town, just having a good time every Friday and Saturday night. I would never think about what would happen in these parties or cruises I would take around town(.) My mother would warn me about the possibilities in getting involve in car accident and other malisons things that can happen at parties(.) (S)he would tell me to stay home and do useful things with my time other then just going to parties. I would never listen, I would tell my mom that will not happen to me, I myself thought I was very careful and conscious of everything I did but unfortunately not everything turns out the way I planned.<br>  <br>  On May 16, 2003, on a Saturday night; I was getting off from a high school drill meet and a couple of friends (Ana, Cynthia, Cathy and Cassie) and I decided to go out to a house party. As Ana drove us to the party on the feeder road of 45N and 610 a red pick up truck hit us in full speed making the car we were in flip one time and spin two times, Next thing I knew it was silence for a minute and I screamed “ Ana!!, Cassie!! Is everybody okay?!?” I tried to move but I could not, my hand was stuck in between the broken window and the edge of the door, then I heard Cathy scream “ I’m bleeding from my legs I cant move my leg!”, then Ana cried out loud “ I made it out of the car, is everyone okay ? I’m calling 911!”, “help me!” I said, “ (I'm) stuck! I cant move my left hand is stuck on the edge of the door(,) please help me!” Cassie climbed out of the car(,) (she was) okay (with just) a few scratches and bruises, (we) tried to pull Cathy out of the car as (hard as) she could and then tried to pull me out, “ I can(')t pull you out(,) your fingers are stuck underneath the door(,) it’s to heavy I do not want to hurt you”. The paramedics came 15min’s they helped me get out of the car and luckily everybody else was okay with just minor scratches, scraps and bruises.

I'm sure that many have been advised many times by their parents, teachers and school counselors the dangers of hard partying as well as preventive measures to have a good time without it getting out of hand. I was once one of those high school seniors. When I was 17 in 2003; I used to love going out to parties, clubs, and loved driving around town just having a good time every Friday and Saturday night. I never thought about what would happen in parties or cruises I would take around town. My mother would warn me about the possibilities of getting involved in a car accident and other dangerous life threatening occurences that can happen at parties. She would tell me to stay home and do useful things with my time other then just going to parties but I would never listen. I would tell my mom that nothing bad will happen to me because I was being safe. I thought I was being very careful and conscious of everything I did but unfortunately not everything turns out the way I planned.<br>  <br>  On May 16, 2003, on a Saturday night; I was getting off from a high school drill meet and a couple of friends (Ana, Cynthia, Cathy and Cassie) and I decided to go out to a house party. As Ana drove us to the party on the Feeder Road of 45N and 610 a red pick-up truck hit us in full speed making the car we were in flip one time and spin two times. Next thing I knew it was silence for a minute and I screamed “ Ana!!, Cassie!! Is everybody okay?!?” I tried to move but I could not, my hand was stuck in between the broken window and the edge of the door, then I heard Cathy scream “ I’m bleeding from my legs I cant move my leg!”, then Ana cried out loud “ I made it out of the car, is everyone okay ? I’m calling 911!” and I cried out “help me!, “ im stuck! I cant move my left hand it's stuck on the edge of the door please help me!” Cassie managed to climb out of the car with just a few scratches and bruises. She tried to pull Cathy out of the car  and then tried to pull me out, “ I cant pull you out your fingers are stuck underneath the door it’s to heavy I do not want to hurt you”. The paramedics came within 15 minutes. They helped me get out of the car and luckily every body else was okay with just minor scratches, scraps and bruises. I had 2 surgeries on my left hand both middle fingers. Two weeks later after the accident, my mother told me how afraid she had been and I thought to myself at the time, my mother was right, I should have listened to  her, we all should have listened to the warning signs to  prevent the accident so that neither one of us would have been in that situation.<br>  <br>  Take my experience for example; do not make the same mistake I did, I learned a lesson from that accident, to think and listen to the advices that our loved ones tells us. It is not because they do not wants for us young people to go out and have a good time or to enjoy our lives but because they want for us to be okay, safe and encourage us to be safe.

MHg9JhEKaa	Go with what you enjoy my love. GCSE's don't really open up options when it comes to jobs. On your CV, employers they will skim over your grades and that's about it - they won't be at all interested in which subjects you took. Try to see GCSE's as a stepping stone to doing A-levels, rather than dictating which job you could get.  With most subjects, you don't have to have a GCSE to do an A-level in it, so you certainly won't be limiting your future options by your GCSE choices now. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you're swaying towards art: you like it, so don't dismiss it because it's hard, it's good to challenge yourself!  As for the other options, well do you have a liking for any of them? Do you have any ideas about what you might like to become?|`|4Vw9An50aa	Triple Science is very useful. To start off with it is 3 GCSE's rather than 1. It is useful for a ton of jobs and a lot of people tend to do a science based course at college, so triple science will be useful. I advise you to take it as it leaves so many options open just as you said. But be prepared to work hard as well.<br>  <br>  If you don't like french then don't worry about taking it. If you do not like it then it means that you might not put much effort in and it is a waste of a GCSE.<br>  <br>  For the second choice I would chose something that you enjoy and are good at. I don't think art is all that useful to be honest. Either go with geography of history. Geography is pretty easy at GCSE and history is interesting so I would pick one if them.|`|dwtwFWc6aa	science will open so many doors for the future... i did art... its not that hard, you have to be able to write good english coz like half your marks are based on that. science is fun!!!|`|HjAVO4Kgaa	performing arts<br>  history<br>  geograpgy|`|vJa7abGfaa	def. triple science...and...if you haven't got a language then french but if you have then i'd do history!|`|xCbirkdOaa	Choose whichever you enjoy. For later jobs, i'd chose science because it's one of the core subject qualifications that a company will look for. As long as you're doing English, Maths and at least 1 science, you won't have trouble finding a company who will want to employ you. Your last choice should be the subject you enjoy most because otherwise you may not put in 100% for the subject. I'm doing English, Maths, Science, ICT (compulsory), PE, German, Geography, Food Technology.<br>  <br>  Geography's really fun, the topics we study include earthquakes and volcanoes and populations. History i don't do but my friends say it's good. If you don't know what to do, why don't you go and see your subject teacher and ask about the benefits of each subject as well as learning about the drawbacks. Then you'll be more educated and the decision will be easier to make.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Hattie x|`|hqH1EZFSaa	I took:<br>  <br>  Maths, English, French, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, PE and Computing.<br>  <br>  These can have good jobs at the end of them. I took those because i like the class or it is easy and i do not think you should take a subject you are not good at or if you use it to pass time. I think you should take geography instead of history because in geography you learn things that can help you, history is about things in the past and there is no point to it.<br>  <br>  So the 2 subjects you have to take, i would recommend triple science and geography, these two combined have very good paying jobs at the end of them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|fKH7fVHPaa	well i think you should do the things you enjoy, ive learnt that its not actually the grades theyre looking for its more of the passion you have in the particular subject/course you want to do think about it theres no point in doing somthing you dislike just because its "accademic" or "will benifit you" this will just make you miserable. stick to your guns and take the subject you actually enjoy doing.|`|AA11184501	Well if you think what your good at maybe that subject? But if you like a subject but think its too hard have a practise and see. Maybe ask your teacher what kind of things they will be asking you to do or what they will be looking for. Hope this helps a lot!<br>  <br>  x|`|d85aff64e15a29d3e932afd79e40640baa	I think Science cos it's endlessly useful and Art cos you like it.  That kind of covers all bases in real life.|`|AA11678263	Don't take French if you don't like it.  You won't enjoy it, and you won't put all of your effort into it for this reason.  It's an advantage to speak another language, but not an every day skill you must have unles you want to be a translator, or specialise in something that requires you to be bilingual.<br>  <br>  If you really enjoy art, you should take it anyway, regardless of whether it's hard.  If you kind of like it, but think you will be stressed by it, you need to weigh the pros and cons.<br>  <br>  Triple science will be very useful if you wish to go into any form of medicine or science field, e.g. nursing, Dr, pharmacy, dentist, vet.  It may be necessary to have these GCSEs to get onto the Science A Levels.<br>  <br>  I would choose subjects that you enjoy, or that you think would be useful for your A-Levels/ long term career goals.  Once you have A-Levels, your GCSEs aren't all that important anymore, although it is important to have good grades in English and Maths.  If you wanted to be an artist or fashion designer, science would be not be an advantage.  Have a think about what sort of area you are likely to go into, and use that to inform your decision.  Enjoying your study is important, as you tend to better in things you like as you try harder =o)<br>  <br>  I'd disregard French, and take art because you like it, then whatever you prefer out of science, history, and geography.
6K1D6Azmaa	In order to get accepted into pre-med school, you will need perfect grades. Then you will still need to get accepted into med school, so it is very important to choose the best pre-med program possible, as many actually have a low acceptance rate. In undergrad you should major in biology, chemistry, or preferably both. Before you graduate from med school, you will need to get accepted into an internship and then a residency in surgery at a hospital that offers this, and I believe there are far more applicants than openings. <br>  <br>  Unless there is something seriously wrong with your high school, I would not transfer. But probably the people in the guidance department can give you a better idea of whether you should do that. ?|`|vyVDWIehaa	Too early to be asking this question.

I live in Ireland, so obviously the education systems are different, and I can't really give you any answers to these questions myself. I do recommend that you try to see if anyone in your family has connections to any kind of surgeon, They could probably give you an idea of what route to take, even if they're not a neurosurgeon themselves, as you have to go to college and then study medicine before you specialise even in just surgery, let alone neuro. I found that talking to someone who had actually done what I'm aiming to do gave me a better picture of what I should do, and also what the job involves (it can be very stressful!).<br>  <br>  In general, those who wish to do medicine, or pre-med, need pretty much straight As, and high SAT scores, as well as a good GPA. I doubt you should transfer high schools, it probably won't make much of a difference overall.<br>  <br>  I wish you best of luck in your endeavours!|`|n5YJS2Z7aa	simple. get straight A's. go to a university. go to med school. get 100,000 dollars a year.

JYDzjudGaa	Metamorphic and Igneous.<br>  <br>  Metamorphic are formed from sedimentary rocks which are put under a lot of pressure and heat from the ground above. Exapmles are marble (formed from limestone), metaquartzile (formed from sandstone) and slate (formed from mudstone).<br>  They have interlocking crystals.<br>  <br>  Igneous are formed when a volcano erupts and lava cools. The faster the lava cools the smaller the sizes of crystals (exapmle basalt). The slower the lava cools the larger the crystals (example granite).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|zYRK0lDRaa	Igneous and Metamorphic rocks if I remember correctly<br>  <br>  I think igneous had bigger crystals due to slower cooling but may possibly be the other way round.

AA11404742	Study heavy duty math - you'll need it for a degree in engineering, to start with.  Probably aeronautical engineering would be a good start, Frank.  You'll likely need at least a master's degree, and maybe a Ph.D.  You'll need lots of experience with different aircraft, too, so learning to fly early would be a good idea.  Learn everything you can about aircraft.  When you're old enough, think hard about joining the military, and getting involved in the aviation arm of whatever branch you join.  This will get you some solid experience and training, and help you pay for that education afterwords, too.<br>  <br>  You sound young, but could start that learning now by getting involved in a couple of different organizations.  The EAA - Experimental Airplane Association - has chapters all over the US, and around the world, too.  Look them up and see if there's a chapter near you.  These guys should hopefully have a project building their own airplane going on, and you may be able to become a member, and could learn a lot from them.  And a week at the EAA flyin at Oshkosh would blow your mind.  Can you imagine a row of parked aircraft that's over 2 miles long?  When I was there, I never found the end of the row.  It just kept going, and going, and going, and....<br>  <br>  The other place to look into would be a radio-controlled aircraft club or group.  You can start by building gliders for just a few dollars, and these guys should be able to help you with that.  I've linked to a couple of websites of groups I know of.  The links on these pages should help you find if there's a group near you.<br>  <br>  Edit - here's one more link, to help keep the enthusiasm level up a bit.  This page publishes a group of pictures of the week every Friday.  Bookmark it and check it each Friday if you like.

rHqe7oMoaa	experience gained throughout our life makes us who we are.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	None of us are born with prejudices.  We acquire them from others, usually our family.|`|DKfScL8taa	Every bigot was once a child free of prejudice<br>  <br>  that's what I think it means<br>  this is not metaphorical in any way, it is actually very blunt and to the point, so there is no room for interpretation.|`|OJpjktj6aa	Means:<br>  <br>  we must create that environment at home and in school to make learning a pleasant and safe experience for every child. Each of us can and must contribute toward dispelling ignorance and reach out to the person next to us in a spirit of equality, justice, all-important basic dignity, and mutual respect. It's respect for diversity and must be a sacred commitment.|`|293924b4c75e0a2d4697b96b557d6740aa	Bigotry is learned and not innate.<br>  <br>  By default we are accepting of all cultures however we pick up our prejudices through life experience and from other people.<br>  <br>  Another example is phobias. We have very few natural phobias, we just pick them up from other people as we get older.|`|jVUEohsNaa	I prefer, "Every bigot was ignorant and finally woke up."|`|A1iDPPOeaa	Bigots are made not born.  Parental and peer influences create hatred.
TSc8OE4vaa	They haven't finished reading it yet but they are thinking about it.

06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	It sounds more like you have been attending a class teaching about Christian beliefs.  I suggest that you have a word with a school representative to ensure that your teacher is actually teaching the cirriculum.  <br>  <br>  Religious education teaches about the beliefs of different world religions, they aren't supposed to be preaching.|`|KyLPuSoQaa	i agree
82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	It most definitely is. It teaches them that they are unique and special, and that their uniqueness is a good thing. It teaches them to like themselves for who they are rather than to change to fit whatever the stereotype is. The child who is raised not knowing how to be an individual is the child who will give into every peer pressure in order to "fit in."|`|mYhuGonfaa	Of course. We don't teach it specifically, rather through everyday actions. We encourage kids to be themselves, to stand up for what they believe in, to do the right thing even when "everybody's doing it", and the list goes on. Social skills and personal growth are as important in the education system as numbers and letters!
I1tnVvVGaa	take as much time as you need....don't worry about putting a time limit on it. no one can tell you when you will feel better. <br>  <br>  <br>  i'm sorry for your loss!|`|crxbob5jaa	You need to talk to the professor involved. This is not a question we can answer. We can't read that professor's mind. <br>  <br>  But my sympathies on the loss of your mother.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Why don't you ask your advisor? He or she will give you a definite deadline.<br>  I'd say though that as long as it's in by the terminal date for your MA, you should be OK, as long as your advisor is getting drafts and being able to see progress towards it in the meantime...<br>  <br>  OAN: Your MA Thesis is only 5k words????

AA12234166	You probably should have thought about this last year, before you took these options. If you knew you wanted to go to uni, but wouldn't want to do 3 full A-levels plus a diploma- then why did you take them?<br>  So now you have to decide, which is more important; university or the diploma?<br>  Personally, I would choose uni- you can still say you had a years experience in H&Sc. <br>  <br>  Or of course, you could take on a massive workload and try for both- good luck.|`|eI9mkxS5aa	English! Spelling to be specific... <br>  <br>  <br>  It's "choices" not "choises"|`|dwhPolzbaa	its all according what you want to do at uni.<br>  i recommend to look at some courses and what you need to get on to them and decide from there.

SVxxJuecaa	yes ou should. or at least get your ged and take some courses in community college and make something out of yourself|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Yes.|`|63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	My daughter went back to school when she was thirty, she received her GED and then started Community college, maybe it was because she knew what it was like to work in dead end jobs. But anyway she studied hard, did well and then went on to a four year college and graduated Magna C--m Laude.<br>  It is never too late to get an education. Ask yourself where you will be in four years, if you do not get an education, comparison of salary's for educated and non educated should convince you, that yes, you should go back to school.

I used to really hate school and still do sometimes, especially when I have a really stressful piece of homework or I have to do some kind of stand-up-and-talk thing. I hate those. So, the answer is yes - I'd say most school kids hate school. But at the end of the day, we need to learn to earn money later in life. And we're really very lucky - in countries like France kids may have to go to school on a Saturday...(muahahahaha).|`|875x505Maa	Tutorials-<a href="http://tutoringsite.info/" rel="nofollow">http://tutoringsite.info/</a>|`|QiMEymIVaa	ahh i hatee school soo much, but i suppose its for our own good so we jus hav to get on withh it im afraidd :/
IXskJPlVaa	Some 10 yrs back another girl asked the same after getting thru IIT JEE and counselling - after completing B Tech Civil - she was selected by Infosys in campus recruitment and now has left the job and pursuing MBA from IIM-L. So you can see possibilities are endless. Basically all streams of Engg have sufficient Physics content but mostly - applied and it is not very difficult. Comparatively - Civil Engg has less compared to Mech/Elect/ECE/CS etc. Best of luck.|`|Moz2d806aa	Yes. You will probably get tons of extra job offers solely because you are a girl. It basically is applied physics, with a real concentration in mechanics, so yes.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Yes, it is absolutely good for females. I would encourage females to seek out hard science and engineering majors if at all possible.  Just too many of them majoring in weak social sciences (it's like a 75/25 split for psychology for example) that leave you jobless upon graduation.  Engineering is great.  It is a challenging major for anyone and there is a lot of physics, usually starts right off with at least 3 full semesters of calculus-based physics in mechanics, electricity, and quantum mechanics for any prospective engineering major.  The engineering areas are still male dominated in many areas but hopefully that can continue to balance out.|`|wsAqe1Mgaa	Yeah of course, civil engineering is good for girls. I'm a fourth year civil engineering student, and with that span of time being in the civil engineering field, i don't see gender as a major obstruction. Actually, it is your interest and your capability that matter on taking the challenge of civil engineering.  I can say that it is a very tough course, you should be hardworking, you should have enough patience. There are a lot female passers of the civil engineering board exam. Actually, in our country, last year, the topnotcher of that batch is a woman. With regards to the job opportunities, female civil engineers can be in offices, doing autocad, or if they want to be in the field, doing surveying or road works, then why not? Female civil engineers can also be in transportation or on water resources. <br>  <br>  Civil engineering involves a LOT of math (it can be basic math or the complicated math) and of course there is physics (but the best term for that is 'mechanics/ strength of materials'). it also involves analysis, steel-timber-reinforced concrete design.<br>  <br>  So, that's it. There are a lot of things about civil engineering and the above mentioned ideas are just the basic ones. You can always ask us if you want. I hope I have helped you.|`|VGhPmsQUaa	<a href="http://findingyouranswer.dalnet.ca" rel="nofollow">http://findingyouranswer.dalnet.ca</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
YMI6Yl18aa	No you don't. Actually it doesn't matter waht GCSE's you take or even what A-levels you take. There aren't any fixed, definitely required subjects for lae. In fact many people opt to do a different degree altogether and then switch into law, doing a fast-tracked degree course. <br>  <br>  At GCSE what is essential is good overal scores, so plenty of As and A*s. What subjects these are in is irrelavent and universities mainly use these to see whether they should offer you an interview. They don't particularly care which these are in, so long as they are mainly "proper" subjects, not doss ones like media studies or whatnot. <br>  <br>  At A-level, i would recommend history, english, politics and a modern language as very good options, though again these aren't required. Make sure though that yiu are involved with debating clubs and are confident with your public-speaking skills. <br>  <br>  The subjects you are thinking of taking for GCSE's are very good. Though if it were at all possible i would say that eight wasn't really enough, but if that's the standard at your school then nevermind. <br>  <br>  I would advise possibly considering history instead of Drama or atleast in addition to these subjects. Mainly because if you are determined to be a lawyer then history is a very likely option for you at A-level and you are seriously handicapping yourself by not taking it now. It teaches you valuable lessons in essay writing, and being able to evaluate and analyse critically a source. You might also not be allowed to take the A-level without the GCSE.<br>  <br>  So i would say think very hard about not taking history, i would strongly recommend it to you, as it is a much more worthwhile subject than drama, however good having a creative subject is.|`|xCbirkdOaa	You don't have to take History, i don't think. It's good that you're doing the Science's, Maths and English's because these are the qualifications most companies look for. A language is also good because if a company needs to communicate with foreigners, they'll be likely to employ someone who has leant an additional language. ICT is good, it's always good to employ someone who knows about computing - as so many companies now use computers in everyday work. Drama sounds fun - I don't personally do it but friends say it's fun. Economics'll be good - our school doesn't offer it. But it sounds good and companies will look for those qualifications, especially if you want to go into accountancy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Hattie x

Some people are very well off, other people really struggle.  Obviously, then, there will be a difference in clothing.  People with a lot of money will have expensive, designer clothing, whilst the poorer people will have cheap clothing, which would start off bullying issues.  Also, different cliques wear different types of clothes.  People would be bullied because of how they dressed as well.  Nobody likes uniform, but it's necassary.

HH37zJKraa	There are many different variables to consider.  The first, is the area in which you will be residing.  There are many very solid public schools and also many that are lacking.   I would recommend you research the school district's rating.  Also, look into the class size and student/teacher ratios.<br>  <br>  As for private and parochial schools, I would first make sure it is accredited.  Then, get as much information about how the school ranks within the city, county and state.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the largest difference between public and private, look into the incorporation and use of technology.  There's some schools, both private and public,  that have the purchase of a laptop (included in tuition for private schools) and the entire school is wi-fi.  The classroom teachers use a smart screen instead of chalk or dry erase boards and the students electronically turn in their homework assignments.

At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922, the British Empire held sway over a population of about 458 million people, one-quarter of the world's population,[1] and covered more than 13,000,000 square miles (33,670,000 km2): approximately a quarter of Earth's total land area.[2] As a result, its political, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was often said that "the sun never sets on the British Empire" because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous territories.<br>  <br>  During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Spain and Portugal pioneered European exploration of the globe and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires bestowed on Spain and Portugal, England, France and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (following the 1707 Act of Union, Britain) the dominant colonial power in North America and India. However, the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after a war of independence was a blow to Britain, depriving it of its most populous colonies. Despite this setback, British attention soon turned towards Africa, Asia and Oceania. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of effectively unchallenged dominance, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe. Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies, which were reclassified as dominions.<br>  <br>  The growth of Germany and the United States eroded Britain's economic lead by the end of the 19th century. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, for which Britain leaned heavily upon its Empire. The conflict placed enormous financial strain on Britain, and although the Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the war, it was no longer a peerless industrial or military power.

At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922, the British Empire held sway over a population of about 458 million people, one-quarter of the world's population,[1] and covered more than 13,000,000 square miles (33,670,000 km2): approximately a quarter of Earth's total land area.[2] As a result, its political, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was often said that "the sun never sets on the British Empire" because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous territories.<br>  <br>  During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Spain and Portugal pioneered European exploration of the globe and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires bestowed on Spain and Portugal, England, France and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (following the 1707 Act of Union, Britain) the dominant colonial power in North America and India. However, the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after a war of independence was a blow to Britain, depriving it of its most populous colonies. Despite this setback, British attention soon turned towards Africa, Asia and Oceania. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of effectively unchallenged dominance, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe. Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies, which were reclassified as dominions.<br>  <br>  The growth of Germany and the United States eroded Britain's economic lead by the end of the 19th century. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, for which Britain leaned heavily upon its Empire. The conflict placed enormous financial strain on Britain, and although the Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the war, it was no longer a peerless industrial or military power. Despite emerging victorious, the Second World War saw Britain's colonies in South-East Asia occupied by Japan, which damaged British prestige and accelerated the decline of the Empire.

trKgx3Ukaa	The first question you have to ask yourself is: how much money do you have available to support yourself through a degree. <br>  <br>  Australian universities, unlike those in the USA, have very few scholarships available to international students. <br>  <br>  Also, what is cheap? In Australia you will need at least around $20,000 AUD to pay for each year in an undergraduate course. The exact figure depends on the course, but this is about close to the average. Then you will need at least $10,000 to pay for your books, travel, living expenses etc. Hence, you are looking at around $30,000 per year for a university education in Australia. I don't consider that cheap. <br>  <br>  You will have permission to work in Australia for about 20 hours per week. But this will not be enough to support all your financial needs. In addition, you will need to show the Australian immigration department that you do in fact have enough money in the bank to pay for at least all of your first year expenses. <br>  <br>  The actual cost is also determined by the foreign exchange rate, which can vary from country to country. <br>  <br>  If you and your sister have exceptional academic records, you might be able to obtain scholarships in the USA. So far, it is the USA that has the most scholarships available to international students. But, the competition for these is intense. <br>  <br>  If you can get free or low cost university education in Mauritius, then you should consider that as your first option, and pursue degrees that will permit you to work in other countries. For example, medical degrees, engineering degrees, accounting, nursing, finance. <br>  <br>  Keep your dream for travel alive. Don't give up and one day it will come true. <br>  <br>  By the way your English is very good :-)|`|AA12074269	I agree with Capt. The fee for an international student is very high in Australia. We dont have scholarships for undergraduates because we have Austudy which is an allowance for Australian students who attend university - so any Australian will have some money while they study.|`|7iiOJKILaa	I do not know much about Australia but i say if you want to go, do it.

9olha1dKaa	Interesting they should say that when the future of healthcare is migrating towards wellness. That means those who are chiropractors, naturopaths, osteopaths, and medical doctors who recognize that keeping the body in optimal health proactively is the best means rather than passively by treating the symptoms. Osteopathy originally was the forefront of this ideal until the AMA wiped them out. Funny thing, this profession is undergoing a revitalization of it's identity and I still believe it's one of the best profession to lead the new wellness revolution.

Most comments like this arise from ignorance, not malice.

Here are some talking points:  DO's are fully trained in medicine with additional training in osteopathic manipulative therapies which can be used to treat many musculoskeletal and other conditions.  Though they may pursue any residency they wish, most DO's work in primary care fields such as family medicine and pediatrics, which are likely to be shortage areas in the future.  They are also more likely to work in rural and other underserved areas.  They are fully licensed in all 50 states and US-trained DO's have full practice rights in many other countries.  You may be able to download or request pamphlets about the practice of osteopathic medicine to share with others who have questions about your future profession.<br>  <br>  Try seeing these questions as opportunities to educate others about your profession, not criticisms about your career choice.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	No, you most definitely should NOT be ashamed.

There are buses in Tampa and you can get a monthly bus pass. You will have to make sure that you live on the bus route. You can get apts for $550 and up in Tampa. I would suggest you try to room with other graduate students so you make friends. Ask the housing office for help or try www.tampa.craigslist.org.

As I told you in another answer, Miami is much more expensive and if you don't speak Spanish, you will get snubbed. I don't know anything about UCF. I do know that USF is considered a better school than UCF and FIU. The state ranks the top research universities as being UF, FSU and USF. The others are the next tier down.|`|vyVDWIehaa	A couple of things to keep in mind:<br>  <br>  1) People are two faced everywhere.  No particular state has more two faced or crappy people.  If you know a lot of crappy people, it's because you're a crappy person yourself or it's bad luck.<br>  <br>  2) There's very few asians in any part of Florida.  If that's something you are concerned about, keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  3) Grad school is not like undergraduate.  I'm in grad school now.  In undergrad, you can reasonably expect to have a social life and meet friends in dorms, etc.  Whatever type of person you are, it's likely you'll meet similar folks.  In grad school, you may or may not have a social life.  Your grad program might be a small program which is one clique and some stragglers.  If you don't gel with that clique, then you might have some acquaintances, but you might have nobody to hang out with outside of school.  In grad school, I'd say the chances that you have a social life (from the school) are about 50/50.  Any social life you have outside of school would be all on your own initiative.<br>  <br>  4) You might be able to get by without a car in Miami.  The other places, I would think it would be tough.  <br>  <br>  Not trying to scare you, just giving you my impression.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  To the person above me, I had friends who moved from NYC to Miami who told me there were just about no asians there.

I live in the area. I used to live in Tampa and the traffic is awful and the public transportation sucks. There is a USF campus in St. Petersburg, so that may be an option for you. I like St. Pete better, it's nicer looking and the traffic isn't so bad. The public transportation is also better, but not great. You really need to look at a lot of other things before you move to Florida. It is really hard to find a job right now, though that is everywhere. Rents in some places are reasonable, it is a renter's market right now, but they are higher than some other states and cities. It also depends on what you are going to school for. Some schools may be better for you than others.<br>  The Tampa area does have lots of things to do like football, hockey and baseball games. There is Ybor city which has a lot of clubs. There is also the Channelside district which has clubs and entertainment. There are also beaches near by. From personal experience, if you work in retail or the service industry, you will come across a lot of jerks. That could also be anywhere. There is a mix of races down here and a lot of ethnic communities.

It does not matter whether your parent(s) claim you as a dependent on their taxes or not.  The educational system considers you a dependent until the age of 24.  If your dad is claiming you as a dependent on taxes, then there must be child support or something in there.  Otherwise he wouldn't be able to claim you if you are living with your mother.

qcGX2R8Zaa	because it discourages a student and make them think lowly of themselves...|`|hyHvG1Olaa	Your premise is “students should be given failing grades” and in some cases the idea is sound.  The concept of a student receiving a “failing grade” is sound when …<br>  <br>  1.   It is understood by all parties, i.e. the parents and/or significant others, the student, the teacher, the school’s administration that the “failing grade” provides a benchmark of the student’s individual effort and understanding to the point at which the grade was assigned for work completed.<br>  <br>  2.   The student understands that the “failing grade” is a measure of their mastery of a particular concept and provides information as to what needs to be relearned, retaught, and given increased effort.<br>  <br>  3.   The teacher and the parents use the information gleaned from reviewing an assignment with a “failing grade” as a cry for help or assistance is required and make adjustments in the work of the student accordingly.<br>  <br>  However, all too often students view a failing grade as punishment as do parents.  The reasons for this rationalization is multi-fold but basically the reasons are:<br>  <br>  1.   The student is not mature enough to realize s/he needs assistance.<br>  2.   The parents hold the educational process in low esteem and do not provide support at home.<br>  3.   The teacher has not explained his/her grading policies and rubrics used sufficiently to allow for understanding by all parties.<br>  4.    The student has been on the receiving end of some type of artificial reward system such as money or favors for higher grades so grades are acknowledged externally and not internally where real change takes place and paradigm shifts occur.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your paper …|`|Xtqq71KGaa	they should get failing grades if they deserve them, because we're doing them no favors by coddling them.  we're supposed to be preparing them for life, where you might get fired if you fail at your job, and your marriage and other relationships might fall apart if you fail at them.  it's this coddling mentality that leads to soccer moms getting violent at kids' games, and people thinking only of themselves.|`|wGrRvFePaa	Well, of COURSE they should be given failing grades if they deserve it.

It was the decisive battle of the Waterloo Campaign and Bonaparte's last. The defeat at Waterloo put an end to Napoleon's rule as the French emperor, and marked the end of Napoleon's Hundred Days of return from exile.<br>  <br>  Upon Napoleon's return to power in 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Two large forces under Wellington and von Blücher assembled close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the Coalition. The decisive engagement of this three-day Waterloo Campaign (16 June - 19 June 1815) occurred at the Battle of Waterloo. According to Wellington, the battle was "the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life."[6]<br>  <br>  Napoleon delayed giving battle until noon on 18 June to allow the ground to dry. Wellington's army, positioned across the Brussels road on the Mont St Jean escarpment, withstood repeated attacks by the French, until, in the evening, the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank. At that moment, the British counter-attacked and drove the French army in disorder from the field. Pursuing Coalition forces entered France and restored Louis XVIII to the French throne. Napoleon abdicated, surrendering to the British, and was exiled to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.<br>  <br>  The battlefield is in present-day Belgium, about eight miles (12 km) SSE of Brussels, and about a mile (2 km) from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield is today dominated by a large mound of earth, the Lion's Hillock. As this mound used earth from the battlefield itself, the original topography has not been preserved.|`|PQ9QuiNTaa	Waterloo in Belgium:<br>  <br>  "The placename, of Dutch origin, is most likely derived from "water", and lo(o), an ancient word for "forest."

TOPJybbsaa	Answer honestly after you learn more about what the MBA degree means. The MBA is a general broad degree that prepares students for high level management positions. MBA students study accounting, finance, marketing, statistics, management, economics, strategy, policy, leadership, and similar courses. The MBA is not like an MS that concentrates in one field and prepares students for staff positions. MBA programs offer concentrations in various fields, but this amounts only to 2-3 elective courses in the second year. Students develop an interest in some subjects more than others, so they tend to select a concentration in the subject of their interest. <br>  <br>  for more information, consult the Official MBA Guide. It's a comprehensive free public service with more than 2,000 MBA programs listed worldwide. It allows you to search for programs by location (US, Europe, Far East, etc.), by concentration (finance, marketing, aviation management, health management, accounting, etc.), by type of program (full-time, distance learning, part-time, etc), and by listing your own criteria and preferences to get a list of universities that satisfy your needs. You can use the Guide to contact schools of your choice, examine their data, visit their web site, and send them pre applications. You can see lists of top 40 schools ranked by starting salaries of graduates, GMAT scores, and other criteria.

If you are like almost everyone else, you say these are the later. Depending on how old you are, these times may in fact be the worst of your lifetime. Things do look pretty bleak. However, a brief survey of economic history will no doubt uncover the fact that though these times are far from the best, they are clearly  not the worst...yet. Why don't you ask your grandparents? Better still ask them how they got out of the Great Depression. Did the government just stay out of the business of the personal finances of each American? Did everyone wait patiently until the natural rebound occurred following the stock market crash?|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	Always good to start with a little humor, Quick. Try this:<br>  Shortly after class, an economics student approached his professor and asked, "I don't understand this stimulus bill. Can you explain it to me?"<br>    The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I'll be glad to explain it to you." <br>  The student agreed.<br>     At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house. The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool. They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket. Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can." <br>  The student did as he was instructed.<br>  The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it." <br>  The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.<br>  The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool. The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?"<br>  The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper. The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.<br>  However, after the six trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad. The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits. Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you'll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have been truly productive action!"<br>  The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, "Congratulations. You now understand the stimulus bill."|`|ln49OVTzaa	Yes..<br>  <br>  This is what I'd write;<br>  <br>   There is so much cutting back but when you bury into it, you reliese (idk how to spell it) its for the better. Everything in Nature will take its course. <br>  Pointing out some examples, Ireland, they have to cut back and tighten their belts allot lately.<br>  Nigira (sorry); they are in NO recession because they mind their money ....... continue....
