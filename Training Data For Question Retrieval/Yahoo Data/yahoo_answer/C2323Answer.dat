AA10309738	I don’t know about specific issues relating to Romania but I would suggest developing countries would have less formal regulation and enforcement of the accounting standards which means it would be difficult to tell if a set of accounts gave a true and fair view of the actual financial position of a company which would make it hard to evaluate whether you could achieve a good return on your investment. Companies may present their P&L and B/S in different formats also which would make comparisons very difficult.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little to get you started.|`|AA11467290	Don't bog yourself down with such minute issues like accounting methods.  Just remember that about 10% of the money will be required to be spent on miscellaneous greasing of hands...don't worry, nothing mob related...it's just the way things are done over there.<br>  <br>  Other than that...GO FOR IT.  Romania has experienced a major upswing in just about every facet of the economy.  Real Estate is still hot, development of factories, shopping malls and office buildings is en vogue.  You have a very educated workforce, which is also street smart, and is dedicated to doing well and competing with Western Europe in production and earnings.<br>  <br>  Since Romania joined the EU, they are also building new infrastructure to help along the hot economic environment.  Also, the EU will not let them play around with unorthodox accounting methods (except for my explanation above) so you will encounter a very professional and savvy business practices.  I would recommend you find an International Accounting firm working in Bucharest or any of the major cities if you're worried.<br>  <br>  So, get the money ready and invest.

Gpi3HI3Caa	For most physics calculation, the mass is assumed to be at the centre of Mass. It makes all calculations easier.<br>  <br>  it can be found by simple caluclation for each axis.|`|6DFhlt4daa	The point in a system of bodies or an extended body at which the mass of the system may be considered to be concentrated and at which external forces may be considered to be applied. Also called barycenter, centroid.<br>  <br>  That point of a material body or system of bodies which moves as though the system's total mass existed at the point and all external forces were applied at the point. The Earth-Moon system moves in the Sun's gravitational field as though both masses were located at a center of mass some 3000 mi (4700 km) from the Earth's geometric center. The function of the center-of-mass concept is to permit analysis of the motion of an entire system as distinguished from that of its individual parts.<br>  <br>  the point at which all the mass of a body may be considered to be concentrated in analyzing its motion. The center of mass of a sphere of uniform density coincides with the center of the sphere. The center of mass of a body need not be within the body itself; the center of mass of a ring or a hollow cylinder is located in the enclosed space, not in the object itself. Under the action of a constant force of gravity, a body suspended or balanced at its center of mass will be stable; there will be no net moment acting on it. Sometimes a problem may be analyzed from the point of view of the center of mass of an entire system of objects, such as several colliding elementary particles or a multiple-star system. For example, the complex motions of the earth and moon about the sun become somewhat simpler when viewed from the common center of mass of the earth-moon system, located about 1,000 mi (1,600 km) below the earth's surface. It is this point that is moving in an elliptical orbit around the sun rather than the center of mass of the earth alone.<br>  <br>  The center of mass of a system of particles is a specific point at which, for many purposes, the system's mass behaves as if it were concentrated. The center of mass is a function only of the positions and masses of the particles that comprise the system. In the case of a rigid body, the position of its center of mass is fixed in relation to the object (but not necessarily in contact with it). In the case of a loose distribution of masses in free space, such as, say, shot from a shotgun, the position of the center of mass is a point in space among them that may not correspond to the position of any individual mass. In the context of an entirely uniform gravitational field, the center of mass is often called the center of gravity — the point where gravity can be said to act.<br>  <br>  The center of mass of a body does not always coincide with its intuitive geometric center, and one can exploit this freedom. Engineers try to design a sport car center of gravity as low as possible to make the car handle better. When high jumpers perform a "Fosbury Flop", they bend their body in such a way that it is possible for the jumper to clear the bar while his or her center of mass does not.<br>  <br>  (more....)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/center%20of%20mass" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/center%20of%20mas...</a>|`|bTA5ndeMaa	Your mas should be mass.<br>  <br>  If you have a long stick - let's make it 2m long and spun it around rapidly at its end, you would see that a wobbling effect, a pulling would occur due to centrifugal forces so that the axes spinning it around would shake forth and back.<br>  <br>  If however you moved the point of rotation into the exact point of the center of mass of that stick, where equal matter exist on both sides of that point, the spinning would induce no wobbling at all.<br>  <br>  Maybe someone else will have a better explanation.|`|dvyBTotxaa	If you are asking about centre of mass.<br>  The terms "center of mass" and "center of gravity" are used synonymously in a uniform gravity field to represent the unique point in an object or system which can be used to describe the system's response to external forces and torques. The concept of the center of mass is that of an average of the masses factored by their distances from a reference point. In one plane, that is like the balancing of a seesaw about a pivot point with respect to the torques produced.|`|Coeqlg4Saa	the centre of mass is the point in any object which dosen't undergo any change in its position with change in acceleration etc.<br>  suppose you spin a ball,it goes high in the air,the outer surface of the ball undergoes change in position.but the point in the ball which does not change its position in the spin is the centre of mass of the ball.<br>  centre of mass and the centre of gravity are not same.|`|4cMuedpWaa	The center of mass of a system of particles is a specific point at which, for many purposes, the system's mass behaves as if it were concentrated.

W1tx1p2iaa	You are unable to do an intership in OT without being a OT student due to the liability and malpractice.  You can volunteer and many schools require it. You will do clerical work, cleaning, observing, and possibly transporting to and from the department.  Call your local outpatient facility, hospital or nursing home.  Many schools require this.  You can also become a CNA in a nursing home and be assigned to the OT/PT department.  Then you will be able to "touch" a patient.  Assist with treatment, ambulate patients, do range of motion, help set up patients and get paid.

Other A/L such as Cambridge, Edexcel, London A/L, or SAT 2, doesn’t worth a bit when it comes to getting in to a SL university. If u r a SriLankan @ a foreign country u should do our local A/L. yeah I know its really unfair.<br>  <br>   But in SL there’s a really big fight to get in to a university. In foreign countries just passing ur A/L s is enough. But in SL over 60% of students get sufficient marks to go to a university and only 10.5% of students are being chosen.  And, our unis are free.[b’cos of that free education act long ago]<br>  <br>  In numbers<br>  2007/2008;<br>  198,183 students did A/L<br>  121,421 got sufficient marks to go to a uni.<br>  But only 20,069 were chosen to a uni.<br>  <br>  Because of this huge struggle, even to local students, to get in to a uni we here @ SL don’t offer seats for people who have done another A/L.<br>  <br>  But there r other institutions which offer some certain degrees here @ SL. If u gonna join a one, it better to do the same degree @ some foreign country, cause it gonna cost same, as u did it on USA [may be in Europe, but I heard that in USA it doesn’t cost as in Europe, but I don’t know for sure] but it won’t be worth as a USA or Europe degree. But the degree issued by our government worth a lot. I know some people wi’ SL BSc doing great in USA. For instant my uncle teaches @ a USA uni a the professor in chemistry wi’ no prob cause of the SL degree.<br>  <br>  So all im saying is if u really wanna do ur higher studies in SL.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I've never heard the kind of meanness that your mother experienced, but certainly teachers have a sense of humor, just like everyone else.  It doesn't mean that they are laid back - in fact, the fact that they can get their acts together and act professional in the classroom suggests that they take their jobs seriously, but that doesn't mean that they behave the same way in the classroom that they do in the grocery store or on a date.  We all have different sides to our personalities which we use as appropriate.|`|mYhuGonfaa	I can't speak for all teachers, but here, we do talk, and even laugh about students. But never in a degrading way. Sometimes children do naughty things that are quite funny to adults. But we would never let on to the child that we think it's funny, because we are trying to teach them to act in a certain manner! This is just like any parent, the child can do something bad, and we must reprimand them and act angry or hurt, but sometimes its just funny! <br>  <br>  We are humans, we laugh about things, but we don't hate our students or like our students based only on their academic achievements. I love all of my students and want the best for them.|`|UxooffHZaa	Teachers are human. Yes, we all act more professional at our place of work than at our own leisure. If you go into Business and get your MBA instead of your MEd (Master of Education) you'll act a certain way at work, and differently on your own time. I realized teachers were human in high school when I went into a bar with my dad, and one of my teachers was there, "F" this and "F" that. Just like a normal human upset about something.

O4oCqaKkaa	There are about 50,000 km of convergent plate margins, mostly around the Pacific Ocean – the reason for the reference “Pacific-type” margin - but they are also in the eastern Indian Ocean, with relatively short convergent margin segments in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. Trenches are sometimes buried and lack bathymetric expression, but the fundamental structures that these represent mean that the great name should also be applied here. This applies to Cascadia, Makran, southern Lesser Antilles, and Calabrian trenches. Trenches along with volcanic arcs and zones of earthquakes that dip under the volcanic arc as deeply as 700 km are diagnostic of convergent plate boundaries and their deeper manifestations, subduction zones. Trenches are related to but distinguished from continental collision zones (like that between India and Asia to form the Himalaya), where continental crust enters the subduction zone. When buoyant continental crust enters a trench, subduction eventually stops and the convergent plate margin becomes a collision zone. Features analogous to trenches are associated with collisions zones; these are sediment-filled foredeeps referred to as peripheral foreland basins, such as that which the Ganges River and Tigris-Euphrates rivers flow along. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary a€“ also known as a convergent plate boundary or a destructive plate boundary a€“ is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of lithosphere move toward one another. ...

YS4B1Stlaa	Basically online college works by allowing students to attend classes online through the latest distance learning technologies. All classes are available in video format online. Exams and other evaluations are conducted online and some colleges offer unique methods of professor and student interaction online as well.<br>  There are a number of colleges offering online programs that are not regionally accredited which are not viewed favorably at all. If you are considering enrolling at an online college I would recommend making sure any school you are considering is regionally accredited. I would also recommend contacting a number of schools to find the best fit for you and your needs. Too often people choose to enroll in the first program they find without taking a little bit of time to do a little more research to find the best school available. The beauty of taking classes online is that you are not limited in your college choice by geography.<br>  This site has some good information on regionally accredited online degrees and some colleges to help begin your search:<br>  <a href="http://www.ecollegefinder.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecollegefinder.org</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	1.

You are not very likely to get a 40 on the MCATs.<br>  <br>  The small handful of people who are going to get 40s on the MCAT have already convinced everyone that they are geniuses and have been admitted early to top elite schools with full scholarships. You need to set a realistic goal for yourself.  And you need to arrange your financial matters. There's no way you are going all the way through undergrad and med school on loans. Why not look into the Army - they have a pretty good tuition program and you can go all the way through med school on Army scholarships. <br>  <br>  Talk to a pre-health science advisor at the local university and they can help you make some plans along the right lines.... <br>  |`|gxdej2deaa	at least a 40? lol<br>  <br>  you have a lot to learn kid!!!<br>  <br>  either you are:<br>  1) extremely full of yourself and need to be put in your place<br>  or<br>  2) too young to have any idea what you are talking about<br>  <br>  my guess is 2, but people never fail to surprise me<br>  <br>  the day you get a 40 will be the day i jump off of a building|`|EYrdHJQeaa	usually people take those weekend courses to study for the MCAT. but not until thier junior year at least. lets get through college first.

I found the university I went to challenging at times, but for the most part, pretty easy.  I was amazed at how low the professors standards were.  They are getting used to students coming into colleges with no experience in college writing.  It makes it annoying for good students out there who miss out on a challenge.<br>  <br>  If you are a slacker and think college if for drinking and partying and talking on your cell phone all day, then yes it will be hard.  I can't even count how many conversations I overheard on the bus of petty girls complaining about how hard school is and they don't have enough time to write a paper.... well if they worried more about actually thinking and less about their hair and makeup then it wouldn't be hard at all.<br>  <br>  I rarely ever studied for a test and graduated Magna *** Laude, But I did spend countless hours and sleepless nights writing essays - and if writing isn't your thing than it can be difficult.

In college you are independent and on your own, you don't have mom and dad asking if you did your homework. In college there are many distractions that may keep you from your studies. In college you make new friends and there are organizations that you might want to join All these are factors that may distract you from your studies.

When you arrive every kid you see was one of the five or ten smartest kids in his or her high school. They are all the kids who used to bust the curve when they were in the AP classes. And probably every one of them has something special about him/her that makes them stand out as passionate, capable and determined.  The professors are nice people but they expect nothing less than the best from all their students all the time.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The real question here is, since you have avoided taking technical courses like chemistry, physics and advanced math for years, why do you suddenly want to do a total switch and start on a career which is almost totally technical? The kids who you will be competing against mostly have been interested in medicine since they were in high school. They started taking chemistry - and taking chemistry seriously - when they were 15. Now you want to compete against them. It isnt so much that you CAN'T do it... the question is, why do you suddenly turn your back on all the things you have enjoyed and been interested in for years, to choose things that you never have been interested in. Did you get hit by a lightning bolt or something?<br>  <br>  I think you mainly have to look really carefully and decide what it is you are trying to do. Did you just watch too many episodes of "House"? <br>  <br>  If you go ahead with this plan, you will not have to retake the non-science courses, but you will have to take all the science courses from the beginning in sequence... chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics, calculus, etc. and you will have to do well in them - you need a B+/A average in all of them and then a very good score in the MCATs.... <br>  <br>  Good luck (you're going to need it).|`|4MkrrXIEaa	you should be fine, as most medical schools require you to have a certain number of credits in the humanities. this way you'll be able to focus more on the science classes because you have the humanities out of the way.

Virtually every top school East of Chicago and North of Washington has had smaller and smaller percentages of applicants accepted each year for many years from larger and larger pools of applicants... <br>  <br>  2. I tend to think that there are a lot of Liberals (as opposed to Democrats) in colleges because college teaches you to think. When people learn to think they pretty automatically become liberals. In fact, thinking is a skill that not many non-Liberals ever master. <br>  <br>  I bet that's pretty much the answer you were looking for, right???|`|glVNfXMBaa	you have been brainwashed by right wing propaganda.<br>  over a million high school students apply to universities each year.

He found his area of expertise where he was accepted and welcomed as Airframe and Power plant mechanic and later became Inspection Authorized licensed. <br>  <br>  At the end of his speech Mr. Ellis give a word of advice from his golden experience by saying, “Propeller is important today and the spinner is the most important.” [Check your notes is the above quote correct or is “Propeller is important today and the spinner is the most important.” – more accurate?]<br>  <br>  I am pretty sure without the A&P airplanes, and airlines could not fly anywhere.  Matter of fact, lots of airlines depend on mechanics heavily to maintain their airplanes and to keep themselves in business.

An A&P Mechanic is responsible for completing maintenance on aircraft in a timely manner. <br>  <br>  I cannot see myself as a mechanic due to my lack of interest.

If she never cared about school until now, and has mostly C's and D's, any 4-year college that would accept her is not worth attending, and she's probably not prepared to enter college.  She may need to take remedial coursework before starting even community college.  <br>  <br>  But it definitely sounds like community college is the way to go.  She can live at home, take classes for much less than at a 4-year college or university, and find out if college is really for her - without wasting the money going to a school that's not worth attending.  And if she really wants to get out of the house, she can get an apartment closer to the college.

Med students do not have specialties, you must graduate and then do a residency in general surgery, and then residencies in neurosurgery... so you are looking at a minimum of 12 - 15 years post high school. <br>  <br>  Your undergraduate college is only important insofar as it helps you get admitted to med school. Schools like JH and Columbia, or UCHicago, Duke, the Ivies, etc are good for premed because they have fabulous facilities, small classes and very smart students. Almost all of their premed kids will be accepted at med school. So all you have to do is get into one of the toughest schools in the USA - say Columbia which turned away hundreds of valedictorians this year - and then compete for A's against brilliant classmates. <br>  <br>  It would be a big mistake to try to prepare for US med school at a foreign university.

There are about 3000 colleges and universities. Nearly all of those accept a majority of all people who apply. About 100 schools accept less than 50% of the people who apply. About 20 schools accept less than 30% - those include the famous 8 schools of the Ivy league (Harvard, Yale, Brown, Princeton, Dartmouth, Penn, Cornell, Columbia) and MIT, Caltech, Stanford, Duke, Chicago, and a few others that can be argued as being in the 'elite." these schools are generally accepted as being among the very best in the world.<br>  <br>  The elite schools enroll about a total of 30 - 40, 000 students each year(they turn down probably about 200,000, many thousands  of whom are very well qualified). In those schools there are excellent resources, great libraries, science buildings, art buildings, and student and faculty who are brilliant and hardworking.  In the non-elite schools there are stil some of the best students in america, but they are mixed in with a lot of students who are less well prepared, often less talented, and less dedicated to working hard on their studies.  In those schools you can still get a very good education, but you might have to fight your way through a crowd of people who are not as dedicated to success as you are. <br>  <br>  A way to understand the American system and how it works, is to realize that in many countries only the top few percent of all students get to go to college. In the USA, over 60% (yes, sixty) of all students who can somehow make their way to high school graduation, go on to college.  So even kids who are in the bottom half of their high school class are routinely admitted to a college. Many of them dont ever graduate from college, but they are admitted and get a chance to succeed. So that makes a big difference in the way American non-elite colleges operate, compared to colleges in other countries.|`|AA12141571	I've been contemplating that.

You will go to class every time it's on and you will not leave early.<br>  1.5. And do every single assignment and every single extra credit no matter how stupid, boring, long, or difficult it might be.  Most teachers just give the majority of credit to students who show up and do all the assignments... an A is only a little more work from that point on.<br>  2.  Find the smart people in your class (usually sitting in the front) and sit close to them.<br>  3.  Always try to volunteer in class with questions and answers.  This keeps your mind alert and on the subject.<br>  4.  You can try to form a study group or ask people if they are in study groups and ask if you can join.<br>  5.  Whenever you ask somebody a question or someone asks you something use the opportunity to introduce yourself, ask their name, ask them about other classes they are taking.  Then every time you see them say hi to them and use their name.<br>  <br>  What you should remember is everyone is shy and in a new environment so if you open up others might too.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Jim Z's suggestions are right on target. You must commit yourself to your work. If you had a job where you wanted to succeed, you wouldn't miss a day of work, or ever arrive late. You would always be prepared. You would be friendly to your co o workers and your boss. . Treat college the same way just as Jim suggests. <br>  <br>  Also, you do need some recreation, so join a club. Join a music singing group, or the theatre club, or a service club that does community projects like Habitat for Humanity.  Hang out with positive, non-drinking, non-smoking people who are a serious about success, and you will be successful.|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	Join study groups, join academic clubs - great way to make friends AND find friends to study with... party less, study more.|`|7f251be80ba4719d3db0c6a427f81a33aa	Join a campus organization to make friends on campus.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Maybe this is irrelevant, but I noticed when I was looking at some data at the University of Chicago website that only a small % of their incoming freshmen had done sports in HS, but about half the freshmen had done music in HS. They won't care what you did when you were a little kid, but if you do get a 32 or 33 in ACT then they might be interested. I know three kids who are there now and one of them was a Gold medal winner in a major music competition in Boston. <br>  <br>  If you aren't majoring in music, no school is going to care too much about your music skills. It is a good thing because it shows perserverance and creativity, but not that big a deal - they could take it as a negative - that is, why did you spend all the effort on something you don't want to pursue full time?  AP courses are good if you take the AP test and pass with a 4 or 5, but if you take an AP course and dont take the exam,  that is probably a negative. Why didnt you take the exam they could say? Weren't you confident that you could pass?<br>  <br>  Your credentials are good, but far from perfect. Think about how you can firm them a little....
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The chances of you being admitted to Harvard are basically zero. <br>  Harvard is probably the most famous university in the world. The entering class is about 1200 students, and there are over 20,000 applications from the best students in America, and many thousands from the very best students in the world. Unless you are one of the best students in the Eastern Hemsiphere, you have literally NO chance of being admitted. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, there are 4000 college campuses in the USA and there are over 500,000 international students in the USA. So if you want to study inthe USA, you will be able to do so. However, it will cost a lot of money. Americans are welathy and so the prices are high. Most colleges are not supported by the government, so the fees are very high. A typical college student pays at least $20,000 US and often $45,000 US each year to attend classes and live on campus. This does not include living expenses in the vacation months. <br>  <br>  Almost every American college has a website that tells all the details of the college. To find the names of colleges go to the websites of the Princeton Review, or collegeboard.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|nuqV5KYMaa	it's true that it's unbelievably difficult to get into Harvard, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. if that's your dream go for it. even if you don't make it, at least you know you tried your best. it's been my dream to go to harvard too. i'm a sophmore in high school, and i've been doing a lot of research on Harvard and any classes that it requires you to have. here's an answer to an F.A.Q. directly from www.harvard.edu:<br>  <br>  <br>  "There is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them. An ideal four-year preparatory program includes four years of English, with extensive practice in writing; four years of math; four years of science: biology, chemistry, physics, and an advanced course in one of these subjects; three years of history, including American and European history; and four years of one foreign language."<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. I don't know much about going abroad for University, so you might want to look that up yourself. don't worry about fees yet. there's an application fee and each year at harvard costs about $47,000. but don't worry, if you do get accepted, Harvard doesn't expect families with an income lower than $60,000 pay for any of the tuition. they have need-based finfancial aid. i'm not sure if that applies to students from outside of the US though, so you might want to look that up. <br>  <br>  if you have any more questions, go on harvard.edu and click on admissions&financial aid, and then click on undergraduate. they have tons of answers for FAQ and it's really helpful. Good Luck!!! :)

Go to the library at the teachers college and check it out. <br>  <br>  I taught this format for years. It stinks. There is definitely less retention and comprehension for the students. On the other hand, it is the only practical way for many students to attend school. <br>  <br>  Obviously you need to have a wide variety of activities... some lecture, some small group, some discussion, some thought problems, some drill, some videos, some audios, some physical activities.... mix and match, and be sure the students have some very specific things to do away from class that reinforce what they are going to do within the classroom. <br>  <br>  And, always keep moving, keep smiling and keep questioning them. The time will fly by!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	It is a "matter of public record" whether a person attended and whether they received a degree from a university. The college can divulge that information to anyone it wishes. It is a private matter what courses the person took and what grades he got. That cannot be divulged without a written request from the individual. <br>  <br>  I graduated from a famous college. When I went back to the alumni reunion I happened to speak to the Registrar and I asked him about this. He said they receive many calls per day to verify that someone attended the university - they can give the dates the person attended and say that they recieved a degree. And about once a day they get a call asking about someone who claimed to attend, but who in fact never was a student there. <br>  <br>  |`|DnT8rfvOaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArK6KAzRJtecyb3OISfCG5_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081027155859AAUGyss">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|73atv0hUaa	cool |`|kml4wGw4aa	RU serious.....My what is this world coming to....just think if a doctor did that.|`|hyqf7xR0aa	Not to a private individual.

One of them liked Chicago so much he didn't come home for four years except for a week at Christmas, he made his parents come visit him at school. <br>  <br>  UChicago is famous for being a total immersion intellectual experience. DO NOT GO THERE unless you want to get one of the best educations in the world, hang around with kids who are on fire for learning, wind up with a degree that is as respected as any degree from any college anywhere. Do not go there unless you love learning things, arguing about things, studying things.... <br>  <br>  The city of Chicago is full of fun and interesting things to do, and the Chicago kids are always full speed ahead trying stuff out. <br>  <br>  It is not true that the graduation rate or retention rate for Chicago is bad - they are comparable to all the other elite schools. They had 97% retention for Freshmen, and 85% Four year graduation success, right in the range of other elite schools. <br>  <br>  For all the schools that are high on your list, you really need to visit if you possibly can.

The B.A., B.S., and BBA are generally U.S. degrees.  A lot of it just has to do with accreditation.  For example, my current institution is accredited to offer only B.S. degrees (because some former Provost thought those were somehow better than other bachelor's degrees for some reason!), so we give a B.S. regardless of the field.  We have B.S. degrees in art subject matters, believe it or not.  My last school offered a BBA in business, but a B.S. in accounting.  While some people will tell you there are definite differences, my experience at a number of schools tells me that as long as it is a bachelor's degree, there really is none.

ULZhv6KKaa	It sounds like you are very smart about your life. I think you will figure out what to do. Maybe you can take classes in all those subjects and then after a year or two you can decide what your major will be. I don't think there will be a problem getting a job in journalism/political science as long as you do a lot of internship and PT jobs while you're in college. The main thing is to have work experience. Work experience also helps you figure out what you really like and really don't like so that you can  decide what to do. It's impossible to decide on things when you haven't tried them! I'd just choose a good college, and then start taking lots of different classes and trying to get lots of volunteer jobs, internships, summer jobs etc so that you can decide later. Good luck!|`|AA10798673	Take a breath. <br>  <br>  CALM<br>  <br>  Okay.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, I am a few years older than you. I'm 20 and have been in college since I was in high school. (I know that's potentially confusing, but it really isn't.) This is what I've got to say--take your basics first. If you are not sure what you want to do, then take your time. Stressing will NOT help. As I said, take your basics first. I do not know what you are going to do about school. If anything, go to a community college, take your basics, and then transfer when you are more aware of what you want. Remember, you can change your mind. I know people in their forties who still don't know what they want to do. Life is about learning and growing. When you are in college don't put pressure yourself by declaring your major. If you must, remember you can change it. Like I said, just take your basics to begin with in college. For now, you still have time. Believe that you do. High school teachers will put pressure on you (I remember all too well, plus now I'm going to be one). However, if you feel something is not right, FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCT. Also, use your teachers and counselors. They are there to offer their knowledge, experience, and advice to you. Especially and career and/or college counselors you may have.<br>  <br>  Like I said, breathe.<br>  It helps.|`|BLUhiMCWaa	only sure fire job market is medical...everything else is outsourced

QO5p0kTXaa	Well I'm just choosing mine now too and I'm choosing:<br>  Maths ( compulsory)<br>  English language (compulsory)<br>  English literature ( compulsory)<br>  Biology<br>  Chemistry<br>  Physics<br>  History<br>  German<br>  Geography<br>  P.E<br>  <br>  For my reserves I'm going to put Art even though it's 60% coursework and sounds not very good, but still don't know what else to put. For my other reserve I don't know maybe R.E.<br>  <br>  I picked triple science because I want to be a doctor and chose german because languages are important. History and Geography because I like them and P.E because I couldn't think of anything else lol.|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	For GCSE:<br>  Graphics<br>  Art<br>  Geography<br>  Italian<br>  French<br>  <br>  I chose graphics because I despise food and not very good with manual labour. like designing anyway<br>  I chose art because I can't do music (I've played a violin until I was 16, I should know), drama was too easy, expressive arts has music and I have a learnt talent in art.<br>  Geography because it covers a spectrum of the humanities: business, economics, sociology, sciences, etc. Plus the geography teacher is thorough and pretty good. I wasn't very keen on business studies because I had negative connotations about it at the time. I did not know I had a passion for economics (labour economics was not something that encouraged me). history was something that interested me but I did not like to study pre war stuff (more of an archeological and mythological person).<br>  Italian and French - had a passion for languages although German was a possible choice if I chose it in year 9<br>  <br>  I also did Chinese because I was forced to<br>  I chose Business Studies to do in my own time to do more<br>  <br>  At A Level - I discovered my GCSEs were limited in the sense it provided few jobs that could be offered to me so I chose the following based on career advice from teachers (not always the best option - always go to the career advisor):<br>  Business studies<br>  Mathematics<br>  Geography<br>  English Literature (dropped for Pyschology)<br>  AS general studies (the most useless qualification I have)<br>  These options were chosen because I wanted to do something with finance as a career and I want my qualification and experience to be related (very hard to conform to - would have been better to choose subjects you're passionate about). I decided not to take languages here because they are notoriously hard and it's difficult to suceed unless you have dedication in the subject (and just do one language/ two will burn your brains out)<br>  <br>  For a degree I chose to do Accounting with Management BSc as a second choice (chose Money, Banking and Finance as my first). Choosing a degree that you have no prior knowledge in (despite having done a bit at business studies) is a big mistake lol. i couldn't stand legal stuff and it does that a lot in financial accounting. Management studies talks a lot about psychodynamics and really boring articles which made little pratical sense and is very ineffective (rather learn from self help books) in effect screwed up by degree which is very important for graduate schemes (they ask for a 2:1 and I hit a 2:2). Make sure you have a passion for the subject.<br>  <br>  I am currently studying a diploma in economics and thinking of doing a MSc in Economics and Finance. The MSc for management have very similar modules to the degrees.<br>  <br>  Might do a MBA once I qualify for a professional qualification once I get myself on a graduate scheme.<br>  <br>  Lessons to be learnt: choose subjects you are passionate in but also show that you have certain skills in the job you want. e.g. I wanted a finance related job so I would need maths, technical analysis so maybe economics or physics and I need to be articulate so I would choose subjects that has a bit of debate or has a few essays to do like geography or psychology.<br>  Your degree is important - don't mess up and do your best (postgrad doesn't count as much). Depression can easily set in at uni so always find someone to talk to.<br>  Your GCSEs doesn't matter as much unless you are going for a GCSE level entry job.<br>  A Levels are crucial so you will need to pick subjects you are really passionate and really good in<br>  Pick a degree that you're passionate about because you can always do a MSc in a business related context to show off your business skills or do a MBA afterwards.<br>  <br>  at the moment I am a postgraduate student and I am trying to find work experience in the investment banking sector.<br>  My decisions at first was related to my career choice. However, I did not do enough research into the area so I sort of messed up big time. Always be thorough with what you research if you base your options around your career<br>  If I could change, I would pick subjects that I am more passionate about and maybe choose a language at A Level instead of English Lit (which didn't helped me as such as the teachers promised)<br>  Always look thoroughly at the module outlines and subject intros. The people who hold these inductions have an incentive to sell you their subjects and you may not get the full picture that you want. Ask for testimonies from the people who did it (not just those who suceed in it). Look through the revision books on the subject and see whether it's something that you feel comfortable doing (the logic here is although it looks hard and you might say to yourself that you will mould into it, the question that you will always ask yourself is can you suceed in it despite the hardship and how determine you are at it). Also look at who is teaching the subject and which option slots they are in (I got A* in maths with one teacher but got C with another but those who studied<br>  If you're a career oreintated person, always go and really look into what sort of job they offer, how to get into it and what they want from you. Make sure it's a job you really want to do before deciding<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|M8rwQNyKaa	i choose<br>   Textiles<br>  History<br>  French<br>  ICT<br>  English lit<br>  English lang<br>  RE<br>  Maths<br>  Science <br>  Additional Science|`|Tdzmzu4haa	im doing my GCSE's now and i chose:<br>  <br>  Art - Textiles. i always enjoyed art and wanted a fun subject. i was never that good at art but since taking it as a GCSE my drawing has improved sooo much, it is great fun and was m best option.<br>  <br>  German: because im quite good at it lol (been predicted A*(arrgghh ill never ger that but owell) and my mum said it would be good to take a language and i hate french, and i was rubbish at it i never paid that much attention in french in year 9 cos teacher was rubbish and really boring<br>  <br>  Geography - i was always good at geography, i enjoyed it and fantastic schooll trip to iceland in summer!<br>  <br>  Food and Nutrition - had to choose 4 subjectsdidn'tt know what else to pick so choose this as my best friend was doing it but were indifferentt groups and it is quite boring so iwouldn'ttrecommendd it unless you want to be a nutritionist or something like that<br>  <br>  but choose subjects you enjoy now or think you will enjoy, thats what i did, just food tec in year 9 is fun unlike food and nutrition :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps and if youre still stuck talk to your teachers who tech those subjects, my art teacher recommended textiles to me and it is my fave subject now

Instead of choosing one of his directors or his children, he decided to do something different.<br>  <br>  He called all the young executives in his company together.<br>  <br>  "It is time for me to step down and choose the next CEO," he said. "I have<br>  decided to choose one of you."<br>  <br>  The young executives were shocked, but the boss continued. "I am going to<br>  give each one of you a seed today - a very special seed. I want you to<br>  plant the seed, water it, and come back here one year from today with what<br>  you have grown from the seed I have given you. I will then judge the plants<br>  that you bring, and the one I choose will be the next CEO."<br>  <br>  One man, named Jim, was there that day and he, like the others, received a<br>  seed.<br>  <br>  He went home and excitedly, told his wife the story. She helped him get a<br>  pot, soil and compost and he planted the seed.<br>  <br>  Every day, he would water it and watch to see if it had grown. After about<br>  three weeks, some of the other executives began to talk about their seeds<br>  and the plants that were beginning to grow. Jim kept checking his seed, but<br>  nothing ever grew.<br>  <br>  Three weeks, four weeks, five weeks went by, still nothing. By now, others<br>  were talking about their plants, but Jim didn't have a plant and he felt<br>  like a failure.<br>  <br>  Six months went by - still nothing in Jim's pot. He just knew he had killed<br>  his seed. Everyone else had trees and tall plants, but he had nothing. Jim<br>  didn't say anything to his colleagues, however. He just kept watering and<br>  fertilizing the soil - he so wanted the seed to grow.<br>  <br>  A year finally went by and all the young executives of the company brought<br>  their plants to the CEO for inspection. Jim told his wife that he wasn't<br>  going to take an empty pot. But she asked him to be honest about what<br>  happened.<br>  <br>  Jim felt sick at his stomach. It was going to be the most embarrassing<br>  moment of his life, but he knew his wife was right.<br>  <br>  He took his empty pot to the board room. When Jim arrived, he was amazed at<br>  the variety of plants grown by the other executives. They were beautiful in<br>  all shapes and sizes. Jim put his empty pot on the floor and many of his<br>  colleagues laughed. A few felt sorry for him!<br>  <br>  When the CEO arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted his young<br>  executives.<br>  <br>  Jim just tried to hide in the back.<br>  <br>  "My, what great plants, trees, and flowers you have grown," said the CEO.<br>  <br>  "Today one of you will be appointed the next CEO!"<br>  <br>  All of a sudden, the CEO spotted Jim at the back of the room with his empty<br>  pot. He ordered the financial director to bring him to the front.<br>  <br>  Jim was terrified. He thought, "The CEO knows I'm a failure! Maybe he will<br>  have me fired!"<br>  <br>  When Jim got to the front, the CEO asked him what had happened to his seed.<br>  Jim told him the story.<br>  <br>  The CEO asked everyone to sit down except Jim. He looked at Jim, and then<br>  announced to the young executives, "Here is your next Chief Executive! His<br>  name is Jim!"<br>  <br>  Jim couldn't believe it. Jim couldn't even grow his seed. How could he be<br>  the new CEO the others said?<br>  <br>  Then the CEO said, "One year ago today, I gave everyone in this room a<br>  seed.<br>  <br>  I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me<br>  today. But I gave you all boiled seeds; they were dead - it was not<br>  possible for them to grow.<br>  <br>  All of you, except Jim, have brought me trees and plants and flowers.<br>  <br>  "When you found that the seed would not grow, you substituted another seed<br>  for the one I gave you. Jim was the only one with the courage and honesty<br>  to bring me a pot with my seed in it.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This is actually quite an interesting question. <br>  <br>  Polar bears are descended from continental bears that lived further south, over time they evolved their white coats and other characteristic to live on the sea ice. Bears can live in the arctic because the arctic has a lot of seasonal ice. the bears can go out on the ice, which isnt very thick, and capture seals that come to the surface to breath. Because the Antarctic is not connected to the continents, there was no way for ancient bears to migrate there. <br>  <br>  Penguins can live in antarctica for exactly the opposite reason. There are no bears! And no foxes or other land predators. None of the ancient ancestors of todays land mammals could get there. So penguins were able to swim there, and set up their colonies.... maybe they flew and afterwards evolved to have no wings - or rather, to have wings that were too small to allow them to fly.  They don't need to fly because there are no predators to catch them. In the Arctic there are birds very similar to penguins (different bird family) same kind of coloring, same ability to swim, but the Arctic birds have not lost their ability to fly.... if they had, they would have been wiped out - the arctic bears and foxes would have gotten them.|`|b21fa9f80551f1440779f4c03a279e4aaa	www.bluemoon.net/~opus/nframe/penguin.ht... <br>  <br>  Penguins do live in the arctic as well|`|AA11145843	That's where they were born, and they have no reason to change.|`|9cb9dab7a96516755f318125af6fa3d1aa	Strange question - it is where they developed.

There are a variety of other animals such as penguins and seals on the coast of Antarctica and in the surrounding waters. See this map for an idea of what animals are found where in Antarctica and the surrounding ocean. <br>  There are no polar bears at the South Pole. Polar Bears live at the North Pole, and penguins live at the South Pole. <br>  Humans bring in the only plants at the South Pole itself. There are a variety of other plants such as moss and lichen nearer to the coast of Antarctica. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Index:<br>  Questions about penguins and polar bears and other Antarctic animals<br>  Questions about plants<br>  Questions about insects<br>  General questions<br>  <br>  Questions about penguins and polar bears<br>  Question submitted by Sandra Farley's High School class at Community School South, East Palo, Alto, California. <br>  NO!!   Are there any polar bears in Antarctica?  <br>    No, these animals live in the Arctic region near the North Pole.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Question from Ms. Keyes' class, Nassau/Spackenkill Elementary School, Poughkeepsie, NY   Are there any penguins, whales, or walruses at the South Pole?  <br>    No, there are no living animals besides us people at the South Pole. It is too cold and there is no food for them. The South Pole is near the center of the Antarctic continent. However, at the edge of the continent where the land meets the sea, there are a lot of living things. And, yes, there are lots of penquins and seals that go in the water. There are also lots of sea birds too. We see them when we stop near the shore while traveling to and from the South Pole.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Marie Martin's 1st graders, Freeport, New York    We wonder if you ran into any penguins on your trip. We're learning about them now in First Grade.  <br>    Randy says: Yes I did run into penguins but not at the Pole! After my travels to Antarctica I traveled some in New Zealand. In the north island (remember NZ is in the southern hemisphere, so north is means closer to the equator and warmer) while sailing off the coast between Auckland and the Bay of Islands I saw numerous penguins. I was very surprised at first. There are many penguins in Antarctica, I just was not in the areas where they are found, although I was close while at McMurdo.  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Elieen, age 8, Northeast Elementary, Rutland, VT.   Did you see any penguins?  <br>    Randy says: Yes I did see penguins, but not at the Pole. Penguins live mostly in the water and so are most likely seen on the coast. The South Pole is very far inland and very high up. Much to my surprise the only penguins I encountered during my travels were in New Zealand in the warm austral summer weather of the north island.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Mrs Gladstone's class, Nelson, New Zealand.   Why do Polar bears only live at the north and penguins in the south pole?  <br>    Actually neither penguins or polar bears live at the South Pole. It is too cold, too, high and too far inland to support any life. At the coast of Antarctica there is a variety of life, including penguins and orcas.<br>  The most probable reason that the North Pole has larger species and a greater variety of life is because it is much warmer than the South Pole. The reason the North is warmer than the South is that the North Pole is in the middle of a body of water while the South Pole is in the middle of a large continent, and water tends to moderate temperature.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Mrs Arfuso's class at West Leederville Primary School, West Leederville, Perth, Western Australia. Question from Mrs Gladstone's class, Nelson, New Zealand.   Are the fish in the Antarctic waters able to be eaten or are they poisonous?  <br>    This is an interesting question!<br>  Certainly the seals and penguins and whales that live there eat the fish in the ocean surrounding Antarctica, so since there are mammals that eat the fish and don't die, my suspicion is that they are not poisonous for humans either. <br>  <br>  According to what I found this morning, in the Ross Sea, which is very far south near Antarctica, there are 35 species of fish, most of them are bottom-dwellers. In Antarctic waters less far south, there are probably more species not only because there are more different types of food but also because fish need a special set of adaptations to survive in Antarctic waters, including adaptations that prevent formation of ice crystals in their blood and bodies. But I don't think that makes them poisonous.<br>  <br>  Since I'm an astronomer, not a biologist, I mailed a biologist to ask to be sure. He writes: <br>  <br>  I orginally wondered if the antifreeze that these fishes have in them to keep them from freezing is toxic because the antifreeze in our cars is toxic. But then I realized that this antifreeze is VERY different; it is a glycoprotein (a protein with sugar attached) and is not toxic. I have eaten one of the fish: Dissostichus mawsoni. It was quite tasty and I didn't get poisoned. As you say, the mammals and penguins eat many of the fishes in Antarctic waters and since their cell biology is much like ours it is unlikely that the fish they eat are poisonous to us. To more directly answer your question, I don't know of any toxic fish in Antarctic waters. However all that is known about many of the fishes is their name and what they look like. In fact new fishes are still being discovered there. It is possible that there are toxic fishes there but I don't know of any. If I find out otherwise, I'll let you know. However I do know that some of the sponges in the Antarctic waters are toxic. <br>  I myself have heard that sponges in the rest of the world's oceans can be toxic too, so I don't think that that is particularly unique to the Antarctic waters.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Questions about plants<br>  Question from Judy Moloney's second grade class at Sheridan School, Lake Forest, Il   What kinds of plants do you find in Antarctica?  <br>    Some areas have algae and moss.  <br>  <br>  According to this page from the Norweigian Polar Institute, <br>  <br>  The vegetation on the Antarctic continent consists mainly of algae, lichen and mosses. Around 300 species of algae have been observed. Of these, approximately 20 is found living on or in ice and snow. Other algae species thrive best in areas that are fertilised by penguins and seabirds, near the coasts. In addition to the algae, around 200 lichen species, 85 moss species and 25 liverwort species have been observed in Antarctica. Two flowering plants (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) have been registered in the northern coastal areas. <br>  <br>  Questions about insects<br>    Question from Mrs. Gerry's 2nd grade class, Bannes School, Tinley Park, IL.: Are there any insects in the South Pole? If so, what kinds?<br>  Question from Ms. Merker's 3rd grade class, New York: We want to find out if there are bees in Antarctica. We are studying bees and want to know which continents have bees. Please email us with your reply and we will put you on our classroom map.  <br>    There isn't any native form of life at the Pole. There is a wingless midge that can survive within a few hundred miles of the Pole. <br>  In fact the absence of other life forms makes one appreciate things that are often taken for granted. Once a bumble bee arrived with the fresh produce shipment "freshies", that arrived from New Zealand. The entire South Pole station became engrossed in the fate of the bee. Also when researchers return to Christ Church after being on the ice for some time they often go straight towards the beautiful botanical gardens, to see and smell the flora and fauna.<br>  <br>  (Penguins and whales and seals and things live on the coast of Antarctica, a long way from the Pole!) <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  General questions<br>  Question submitted by Connie Miller's eighth grade classes at Eisenhower Junior High School in Lawton Oklahoma.    What keeps the animals from freezing?  <br>    Large animals, such as penguins, seals and whales, have a thick layer of fat called blubber under their skins. This fat layer acts as an insulator to keep theses animals warm. Fish, such as the naked dragon and the Antarctic cod, survive in the cold waters of Antarctica because of a special substance inside their blood called glycopeptide. This substance acts much like antifreeze. Antifreeze added to the water in a car's radiator keeps the water from turning to ice just as glycopeptide keeps the blood of these Antarctic fish from freezing.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Question from Lacey Russel at Bear Branch Elementary School, Magnolia, TX.   Do animals that die in Antarctica rot?  <br>    Antarctic animals live along the coast of the continent. In some areas, such as the Antarctic penusula, the temperatures get above freezing. Most likely other animals would eat the dead carcass, but if not eaten it could rot in the warm summer temperatures. In colder areas of the continent where the temperatures do not get above freezing, carcasses of seals have been found in the ice that are hundreds of years old.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Mrs. Kotowske's 2nd grade class at Sheridan Elementary School, Lake Forest, IL   Do you use dog sleds?  <br>    Dogs are no longer allowed on the continent. There is a concern that seals and other mammals will get rabies (and other diseases) from dogs, so they are banned from the continent.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Lauren Russel at Bear Branch Elementary School, Magnolia, TX.   How do scientists study animals in Antarctica?  <br>    CARA scientists study astronomy at the South Pole (where there aren't any animals except for humans), but we dug around to try to find the answer to this question anyway. It seems that most of the time, they attach transmitters or actual cameras to the animals, and track the animals for as long as they can, until the transmitter falls off. Sometimes, scientists dive into the water to be with the animals in their own world -- scientists who study emporer penguins have to be in a cage (like you might have seen in shark programs), not for protection from sharks but from seals.(!) Here is an article highlighting some of the research in Antarctica, including information about the studies of Emporer penguins. <br>  Janice says: I spoke with Pam Yochem, a scientist from Hubbs-Sea World Research in San Diego, California about her studies of Weddell seal pups. Ms. Yochem is part of a 4-person team under the direction of Tom Gelatt from the University of Minnesota. Others on the team are Sharon Melin from the Univeristy of Minnesota and Brent Stewart from Hubbs Sea World in San Diego. The objective of this study is to find out more about the weddell seal pups. Little is know where these young seals spend the first year of their lives. After they are weaned they are not seen on land or in the water. To determine the movement of the pups, quick setting marine epoxy is used to glue satellite receivers to the fur of the pups. Transmissions from the transmitters can be monitored from the United States. The battery in each transmitter lasts about a year and the hair of the pups sheds about this time. I hope to be in contact with Ms. Yochem about the results of this study. But don't expect results for at least 1 year. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Gail Phillip's 5th Grade Class, Pine Street School, Bishop CA.   Do any kind of whales live in the south pole? If they do, what kind?  <br>    Whales live in the ocean and the fartherest south that the ocean goes is around Ross Island. The south pole is about 885 miles from McMurdo on Ross Island. There are no animals at the south pole.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Question from Mrs. Grothaus' 6th grade class, Greenland School, Oconomowoc.   I am doing a project on Antarctica in my 6th grade class and I was wondering if there was a web site somewhere where I could get some information about weather, animalife, plantlife, etc?  <br>    There are a multitude of sites with information on Antarctica, search the web with the key words Antarctica and weather, etc. Aside from what there is here, you should look at the NSF Office of Polar Programs and the Rice University Glacier site.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This is a tough question to answer because the definitions of 'researcher' and 'professor' are kind of loose.<br>  <br>  There are over 6000 different schools that an American student can choose from when he finishes high school. About 2000 of those are colleges and universities. A very small college might have only 5 or 10 professors, but many large universities have 1000s of professors. Some of the professors only teach, and do little or no research. Other professors, especially at some of the famous schools, do little or no teaching and only do research. <br>  And there are many thousands of researchers working at private firms.  I have know high school teachers who did really good research projects as well... so, the total number of people who might fit in your definition is definitely in the millions.

The only"communist" countries left are Cuba, which is only communist by title, and China, which has a very distorted kind of oriental communism.<br>  <br>  Cuba's health care is pretty good by the standard of most poor countries. It focuses on preventative medicine, and a generally good but not great level of health care available to everyone, rather than state-of-the-art health care available to rich people and no health care at all available to poor people, like the USA. <br>  <br>  China is in somewhat the same situation, except that the rural health care in China is not very good and many people resort to traditional methods of "healing" rather than scientific medicine. Anyone who has traveled in China knows that the sanitary standards there are not very good, and sanitation is the first step in a health care system, so that is a problem for them.<br>  <br>  ps the supposed health care in some of the socialist system in Europe has some upsides and downsides - if you want to have a good view of the British health care system, for instance, read up on the problems they have had with dental health and the extreme lack of dentists.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	See this notice - it is from the front page of Tulane University's webpage. Whenever you go to the webpage of a respectable university they will have a link to some statement similar to this. <br>  <br>  "Tulane University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097: Telephone 404-679-4501) to award bachelor's and master's degrees. Tulane's Freeman School of Business is accredited by the AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), the premier accrediting body for business schools."<br>  <br>  You should go to the website of the online school that you are interested in and they should have a very similar statement. There are lots of bogus organizations that pretend to accredit colleges, so anyone might have some kind of comment that they are accredited. Don't beleive it! The only one that really counts is what is called "Regional Accreditation" - since there are several regional organizations that do the accrediting - like Southern, Western,  New England, etc.. what you will need to do is check the website of one of the famous schools that is around the same area as the online school. Then the online school should have a notice exactly the same as the one for the famous school. Otherwise, save your money, they are probably just ripping you off. You will wind up with a phony degree that no one will honor.  Be careful!!! And good luck.|`|954128e9948b8589eb64300d3a005f14aa	I heard State accredited is better.  If you call your local community or state college and ask them if you were to go to this online school, would the credits be accepted there.  It does depend on the school though.

The only ones who can tell you how this works is the staff at the Registrar's office at your school, whether online or campus.<br>  <br>  You need to go (or email) to your school Registrar's office and ask to speak with or make an appointment with the official in charge of evaluating transcipts. No one else can give you accurate information about this, because no one else knows what the rules are for your school.  Most of the time the Faculty don't even know. At the school I used to teach in, the students could go to the Registrar;s office and they had a computer there... you could log on and then request a "degree audit" and they would tell you by return email exactly where you were in reaching your degree.<br>  <br>  If you are still trying to choose an online school, you have to be really careful. The school has to be "regionally" accredited. That is, they have to have the same accreditation as the campus schools in their neighborhood.

AA11377330	Hi, i always have a problem with answering a direct question without adding more, so here's what an old lady thinks. Maybe I can help a little. And it's not a real easy question to answer,.You know there are basically 2 kinds of nurses..the RN and the LVN.  That's your first decision.  RN's can get licensed with a degree in 4 years and the LVN can get a license in 2 years usually. Thus the RN's actually make more money, and it seems as though the future opportunities encompass a wider array of choices for career paths. But they certainly do earn it.  It takes full concentrated dedication.<br>  If you want to go into a nursing program, It might be best to start all the classes you have to take  in a university/ or college that offers a Bachelor's in Nursing.(RN)<br>    There will be: Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology, different kinds of math classes for medications to the patients. But you will get the full program. Actually a greater and more full education. Take into consideration though, that there will also be some classes like different Psychology and mental health aspects, and perhaps a foreign language, and quite a few math classes.  Then, with the RN you will have to do "time" or clinical hour rotations and actually work in a hospital, and maybe a nursing home.  There will also be practical classes like taking temperatures,blood pressures and  and learning the other medical procedures.. All this BEFORE your actual graduation.<br>  <br>  As far as a community college, that could depend on your financial position, and where you live.  Some Community colleges offer pre-nursing programs. These classes would include the basics before you actually take the required classes for the nursing program. Some don't.  However, if you would check on the classes required for the nursing degree at the college of your choice, then see if the community college offers any of those early basic classes. AND make sure the class credits will transfer over to the University nursing program, that may be a way to go too.<br>      If you are young and in a hurry, getting licensed for a LVN (Licensed Vocation Nurse) would take about 2 years and probably 5 days a week.  Could be less expensive at a community college.  Then, after you have worked a while as a LVN, you could work your way through  a RN program already having your first 2 years behind you, AND your clinical hours. And some RN programs will let you come in  the Third of their program  year IF you have a LVN license already.<br>  So, there doesn't seem to really be one better than the other, really, it has a lot to do with your personal situation.<br>  It may take some research on your part, and maybe speaking to the counselors at both university and the community college.<br>  <br>  It does depend on your grades....a lot...and your dedication ,determination, and at times, great stamina and lots and lots of your time.  Be forewarned that there are long waiting lists to get into many Nursing programs.....because there are not enough teaching nurses...sadly, it may be because of money and the investment in their careers .So information about the classes you CAN take while waiting on an opening is important.  All the information you can get.<br>  So: as far as getting accepted into a program, grades are important, your own health is important, and the school of your choice would determine your capacity.  But in final analysis, it's not the college CHOICE that you go to that determines acceptance into a program it's many of those other things.  I hoped this helped a bit on your way to making your decision.It's not a decision that anyone can definitely tell you which is best. All schools are so different in their curriculum.<br>   Best of luck, good wishes,and blessings.|`|82cd805ef981049cb4c21f5356159e05aa	You know some community colleges already have a four year RN nursing program implemented. You would never need to transfer. If you're lucky and near a comm. college that offers it and is accredited, go there.. I can't help you much as far as classes since I only minored in Chemistry and majored in English. Good luck.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You need to check with the dept of nursing at your state university to see what they say about this. Probably the Community college would be OK.<br>  <br>  One thing is, you need to be a good student to be a nurse. People's lives are going to be in your hands. So you need to study very carefully when you take chemistry and you need to practice your math so you are good at it. Not calculus -- you dont need to do really hard math, but you should be just about perfect on arithmetic and decent (B) on algebra. There are a lot of times where a nurse has to calculate a medicine dose for a patient. If you screw up, the patient dies. So you need to be reliable on that stuff.|`|AA10553661	what collage do you want to go to and what kind of grades do you get|`|978c686fad520bfc213e52d0920bf7fbaa	either one, sometimes starting out at the community college is easier because there are fewer things to distract you. the courses you take the first year are pretty basic anyway. if you're the kind that can concentrate and focus no matter what is going on around you, don't mind sharing a room with a stranger and are independent then go for college. if not go with a local college then transfer at the end of the year for a regular college. also consider cost, its much cheaper living off campus. hint: sometimes its easier to get into a more popular college by doing it this way too. but make sure the college you want in the long run accepts the credits from the community college.|`|b702bd00d070b9a4e0c39cce4658478daa	You will save a lot of money if you do 2 years at community college and then go to the university.  You will get a fine education at both places.  CCs are great learning places as well as universities.  If you're getting good grades like that in high school, you'll do fine at college.  Just never miss class, write down everything the professor discusses, read everything you're supposed to, and write well-researched and well-thought-out papers, and you will get As and Bs in college as well.  It's all about determination and the maturity to do what you have to do in order to succeed.  Good luck, girl!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Mozaaart is not really a "Romantic." But this question is a little vague... all of them played from memory. That is, they could play music without looking at the written music notation. I think what the other answerer meant was, Mozart (and several of the other famous guys) could hear music once and then play it from memory.  So that might be what you are asking. But another answer might be Beethoven - Beethoven was a famous pianist before he became famous as a composer. He went deaf and after he was deaf he could still play the piano - he couldnt hear, but he knew what the notes sounded like....

But you really need to go to your local library or the college room in your high school and go through the many excellent college guides available. The librarian will help you find one, but I have a feeling that if you need this much help, maybe  you aren't ready for a good school like Seton Hall - better think about a community college instead. <br>  <br>  ps in the diplomatic service, writing properly is very important. Better practice your spelling - they aren't going to be too impressed at Whitehead when you spell the name of their school wrong!!!!

Elite schools does not include UMBC. <br>  <br>  Check the US News rankings on line. Any of the top 50 schools will give you a very good start on your medical education, and any of the top twenty schools will almost guarantee you admittance to med school if you do well in your premed courses. And, if you cannot afford those schools (most of them are VERY expensive) then you definitely can go to almost any respectable university, state college, etc and if you are a top student, you will have a fighting chance of getting into med school. <br>  <br>  You are on the right track., Keep up with your math skills, do your AP science courses, and you are going to get where you want to go. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

The UK was the first country to go from non-industrial to industrial, but the conditions then were very different from what they are now. An LEDC faces completely different conditions than the problems that Britain had to face back then.<br>  <br>  But some things that were the same would be: poor transportation (in the early 1800s, not in 1900), uneducated workforce (although Britain had a fairly high literacy rate by 1900), poor power infrastructure, poor health care system, lack of reliable and stable democratic government (in early 1800s, not 1900)<br>  <br>  A widely recognized expert on this topic is E. J Hobshawm who wrote a book "Industry and Empire" specifically about this. If you need to do a term paper, that would be a good source.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You have to go to med school. So you have to take the courses that are required as pre-reqs for med school, namely biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics with calculus, calculus. Plus whatever courses are needed for your major. I have known premed kids who majored in biology, chemistry or math, but others who majored in history, philosophy, psychology, Sports and Fitness management or finance. <br>  <br>  If you can't handle the math and chemistry (and organic chemistry is brutal) then you might consider becoming a midwife instead of a physician....|`|7a9e3bf3dc38b5d7858c6ff15ba5440eaa	Yup gotta be a doc first , specialize second, and get a ton of malpractice insurance.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	SInce you have already done a lot of research, you have an idea of what the situation is.<br>  <br>  I know three kids who have gone to Harvard in the last two years. All three of them went to elite high schools. One was #1 in his class, the other two were # 2 and #4 in their classes. But each of them had won at least one gold medal in the National Science Olympiad contest, and numerous State medals. Each of them was a soloist in the State student Orchestra and one of them played oboe in the professional Orchestra. They all were either captains or high achievers in their school debate teams, math teams, student government, and theater groups. Two of them were Captains of sports teams and the other was an alternate to the US National team in a non-school sport. One got 2400 on the SAT and 800 on each of two advanced math SATs. The others did almost as well. One of them was a descendant of early US white settlers, one was a Pakastani and one was an Arab. <br>  <br>  And all three of them were really nice guys who were articulate and interesting to talk to and had great senses of humor.<br>  <br>  That is the kind of kid who gets into Harvard. The 800 SAT kid, by the way, started out as a astrophysics major and decided to change to a different major because he couldnt keep up with the other kids who were too far ahead of him in math!<br>  <br>  Harvard has a lot of money and if you get in they will loan you some, but in order to get a grant that you dont have to pay back, I think your family income has to be no mor than about $75,000 - still most kids would take the loan and go, if they got in. <br>  THat is the kind of person that Harvard accepts.<br>  <br>  If you want to go to school in the USA there are a lot of other schools that are very good schools but much less competitive. And you have a realistic chance of getting some kind of scholarship. <br>  <br>  Take a look at the PRinceton Review list of 300 colleges, or the US News top 100. All of those schools are good schools where you will get a good education at a much lower stress level and probably less cost.

AA11457182	I'm sure this is very frustrating.  Some places just do not promote internally past a certain level.  They always want someone from the outside for their "upper level" positions.   Maybe they think new blood is better.   You might want to look around and see if other co-workers have been promoted.   You've been there a long time and it's possible they only see you in one type of job. Also some people higher up the ladder might feel threatened by your advanced degrees and fear you could replace them, so they will be reluctant to help you.  <br>  <br>   If you have a boss or mentor whom you trust in the business I would go to that person and ask to have a conversation about your long term career goals. Tell them you feel you can do more for the company and ask them how they see your future there.   They probably won't come out and directly say you will never get promoted, but usually a conversation like that will bring clues that will tell you if it's worth staying.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Maybe it's your spelling.

They spread east across the southern USA. <br>  AT that time, from about 30,000 to 10,000 years ago, the northeast and north central part of the USA and Canada were covered by great glaciers.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Private universities in the USA often range up to $30,000 per year for tuition plus living costs of $10,000 for room and board (housing and food). The second level private schools cost just as much as the top private schools, but there is a greater chance of getting a merit scholarship at the second level private schools. <br>  <br>  Public universities may charge from $1000 to $10,000 per year for students from their own state, and much more than that for students from other states. But there are many scholarships. In our state you can go to the State U for no tuition if you are in the top 10% of your HS class.<br>  <br>  To check on the exact costs of tuition at 100s of different schools, check the 'college finder'  section of the collegeboard.com website.|`|b6f0b4f3951291e57c3a094abaae9984aa	Costs vary widely.  Top private universities (e.g., Harvard, Stanford) can run up to $40,000 a year as of the last couple of years (I haven't seen the newest figures).<br>  <br>  Publically funded institutions are much cheaper.  The least expensive will always be public universities in the state where you are a legal resident--they charge lower tuition for residents.  Costs at these institutions will run around $5-15,000/year depending on whether or not you live on campus.  In addition, many states have programs for good students that provide scholarships; the federal government also provides grants for good students, based on need.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that the cost does not reflect the quality of the school.  Many public institutions are ranked as highly as the Ivy League schools--and there are private schools that are mediocre.  Also, you can defer much of the cost of college by getting student loans--these don't have to be paid back while your are in school--and have good terms for inteerest and repayment.  Just remember that this type of aid hast to be repaid, unlike grants and scholarships.

They are home to Championship basketball men's and women's team for years! GREAT SCHOOL, great course, one of the US best public colleges...Lots of major to chose from and great fac. that can help you too! Housing is good as well, many new things on campus and I have a good friend of mine who owns a mexican cantania just off the campus! :)  There's lots of Parties too! But for academics it's GREAT!  It's in a small town setting but lots to do and great people overall! CT is a great state, lots to do and see, it's kinda like the suburbs of Boston and NYC! :) Hartford has come great night life too It's about 35 mins from campus! Also local hot spots or bars are....Huskies & Ted's....what are u planning on studying, they have a great agriculture program and business is great too! :) Lots of cultures and people from all over so you won't be alone in a new country! :) GOOD LUCK!!!!!

The state of Connecticut as a whole has high educational standards, and UConn students are drawn from the better students all over the state. Many out of state students also apply there. THe faculty and facilities are quite good and the school is respected as one of the better, though not the very top, state universities. <br>  <br>  The town where UConn is located is not very exciting, and a lot of the students commute home for weekends. So campus life is not as active as city schools like Northeastern, or residential schools like say, Nebraska. Hartford is marginally acceptable for nightlife, but Boston and New York are just 2 -3 hours away if you have a car. <br>  <br>  In general, I would say that you could get a very good education there, and your degree would be respected. You would have a good time there and meet a lot of good students.

So, for some kinds of immunizations, you must wait until the child's body reaches a certain stage of maturity. <br>  The length of time required to reach full immunization may vary. <br>  <br>  Some immunizations work very well with only one exposure, and other require that the immunization be repeated to be sure that the child develops immunity. <br>  <br>  Very young infants have immunity from their mother and they may have immunity longer if they are being breast fed. So, you can't immunize them if they already have immunity. But when they stop being breast fed then they will lose the immunity from the mother and have to develop their own immunity. So the immunization has to be timed to match the end of breast feeding.<br>  <br>  The public health doctors have to take all these and other factors into consideration in deciding when to schedule the immunizations.

The amount of chemistry and physics required is minimal and the biology is next to none. So you would certainly not be prepared as a geologist to work in other sciences than geology. <br>  <br>  Chemistry is generally regarded as the "central" science. To be a well prepared biologist you need at least 7 semesters, to be a physician or any position in the health sciences you need 6 or 7 semesters, and you need at least a year to be geologist, physicist, or even astronomer. <br>  <br>  THe best idea is to do some chemistry and then do whatever other science you want to specialize in.

They know exactly how it works, right?<br>  <br>  There is no point in going to a spiffy expensive private college to become a teacher - for one thing, they dont have the right courses. And also, they cost a huge amount, more than a teacher can easily pay back. Your best bet would be the state university or a local public college that has a dept or school of education.

I think a person who would be happy spending 3 or 4 years in Mississippi would not be happy in Boston, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  For me, Boston would be the obvious choice. NE is very intimately connected with the other universities around Boston and with the many cutting edge high-tech companies. I think you would have more opportunities there for getting involved in state of the art internships and professional activities. Where you want to spend your career life is important too. If you are educatedin TX you will likely work in TX but if you are educated in the Northeast then you will more likely (not certainly, but more likely) be working in the Northeast after graduation. <br>  <br>  I'm sure that there are plenty of good teachers at MSU and UT, but there is a world of difference in the surroundings of the three schools.

You need to do some research about the MCAT and look for a major that includes the classes for the topics you will need to master to do well on this exam.  I am a science major and know a lot of people destined for med school, most of them are bio or chem majors, some are clinical lab science majors.  Some also choose to minor in bio, chem and even psychology.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) is a private school, a member of the elite Ivy League group of schools. It is not a state university. In Pennsylvania the state university - Penn State - is very good, and is located in the town of "State College"<br>  <br>  Because Penn is an expensive private school, it tends to attract rich kids from affluent, highly educated families and most of the students are wealthy. You probably checked to see that the cost of attending there  is about $50,000 per year and at least half the kids families pay that amount without any scholarships or loans. So, they are far from poor.l <br>  <br>  On the other hand, half the kids are from families who need financial assistance. Most of those are middle class kids, but some are from poor families. <br>  <br>  The Ivy League and other elite schools like Duke, Stanford, UChicago, etc tend to accept very highly qualified students, and kids from rich families tend to do well because of all their advantages. Not that they arent smart, they are! But they are smart PLUS they have great schooling and tutoring. Kids from poor families may be smart, but they just dont get the support to make them top students most of the time. So when it comes to applying to school they are at a disadvantage. There was just a long article about this in the NY Times today (5/27/07) <br>  <br>  It is a real dilemma trying to figure out how to get money so that smart but poor students can go to the best schools.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Most colleges have a notice somewhere in their admissions materials that explicitly states that you cannot appeal the decision. I would be surprised if Williams didnt have that. <br>  <br>  You should not be surprised at being rejected by Williams. They are routinely ranked as the number one liberal arts college in the USA. That means they get thousands of applications from the best students in the USA every year. This college is quite small, so the large majority of those who apply are rejected. I think they were one of the featured schools in a NY Times article recently that said that at least 80 - 90% of their applicants were rejected.<br>  <br>  Even for very good American students, this would be a "reach" school. Being admitted is a great gift, not something that anyone in particular is entitled to.  I think there is virtually no chance at all that they will reconsider your application.|`|ZDzdMGjkaa	You can make a phone call and ask for an interview, but don't hold your breath.

The admission process is highly selective, with less than 17 percent of an extremely talented applicant group being admitted. To be competitive for admission, applicants must have outstanding academic credentials.<br>  Qualifications for International Candidates<br>  <br>     1. Documented achievement in a challenging pre-college program or secondary school<br>     2. English fluency<br>     3. Superior performance on national and/or international tests or final examinations (admitted students typically score in the top 10% of all exam takers)<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  So you can see that not only do you have a small chance of being admitted in the first place (just 17% everything else being equal), that in order to be accepted as an international student, you need to have achieved an extremely high grades and scores. You already said that you don't have a perfect GPA, so that takes you out of the running right there. <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you "didn't care" your first two years in high school.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	To get into med school inthe USA you need a four year BS or BA degree with course work in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, calculus, physics and possibly other courses. You must score high on the MCAT examinations and have the recommendation of the faculty of your college. In American medical schools the proportion of applicants accepted for enrollment from the qualified applicants is from 1% in the most elite schools to around 40% in the less regarded public universities.  If you are not very well qualified you will not be accepted anywhere. No medical schools take mediocre or incompletely qualified students.  In rare cases a very small number of extremely exceptional students are accepted before they complete their BS. That is very unusual. <br>  <br>  The cost at the private schools is about $50,000 per year. At some of the state schools the cost would be more like $20,000 a year if you are a citizen of that state. <br>  <br>  There are very few scholarships but it is possible to borrow the money as a loan and then pay it back when you are a qualified doctor.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Wow, what happened on the SAT?<br>  <br>  I don't think that would disqualify you from any of these schools except Penn. Penn is pretty tough to get in and they might see that SAT as a weakness, but it would depend on what they think of your high school - if kids from that school have done well at Penn in the past they might overlook your low SAT. <br>  <br>  I think you have a good chance at any of the others, based on your GPA and extracurriculars. I don't think there is any advantage in going to a private school...  you can get a good education at Penn State. I'm sure they send lots of kids on to med school each year.  Save you money for med school tuition. You're going to need it! <br>  <br>  Good Luck.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Although I think SoCal Dude's answer is generally good, I disagree on a couple points. <br>  <br>  The main thing is not the residency. If you graduate from a good medical school then you will be able to get a pediatrics residency.  The tough part is getting into medi school. <br>  <br>  Should you go to a tough undergrad school, or an easier school? At the easy school your grades will be higher, but you will be less well prepared for the MCAT tests which are VERY important in admission.  And, everyone at your school will have high grades because it's an easy school. On the other hand, at the tough school only a few people will have high grades, but everyone will be well prepared for the MCATs.<br>  <br>  I think the end result for this dilemma is shown in the records for admissions from different schools. If you went to a notoriously tough school like Univ of Chicago (currently 9th ranked in the USA), then everyone there gets low marks, even though they are very smart. And they ace the MCATs. The med schools realize that UCHi does not have grade inflation, so they respect the students there and nearly all of their premeds get into med school. On the other hand, at state u there may be some good students who get into med school, but a large percentage of all kids who start out as premeds do NOT get into med school. Most of them get washed out or just wind up not applying to med school because they know their chances of admission are poor. <br>  <br>  Some people just cant afford to go to a top college, but if you can, then I think it is worth it because of the superior preparation you will get there.  <br>  <br>  It's a tough decision either way. Good luck!|`|p2Blvupgaa	To be honest with you, the most important thing is to get into a good pediatric residency program after you finish medical school.  You will only learn a few basic things about pediatrics in medical school... most of what you need to learn will come during residency.<br>  <br>  After you finish high school, you do a four year undergraduate program.  You can major in anything you want, but you need to make sure you take the 4 or 5 required pre-med courses.  <br>  <br>  Your undergraduate grades are a big factor in determining whether (or where) you go to medical school.  Rather than going to a top-notch undergraduate school, you may want to consider going to a smaller liberal arts college with a good reputation, or an honors program of a larger public college, where you are more likely to get better grades.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that not everyone in your undergraduate science courses can get "A's," and at a top-notch undergraduate school, it is much harder to earn good grades because all of your classmates are excellent students too.<br>  <br>  In addition to getting good grades, you have to score well on the MCAT exam before you can get into medical school.<br>  <br>  If you get into medical school, you are in school for four years before earning your M.D.  After medical school is over, you begin a residency in a specific branch of medicine (like pediatrics).  Residencies are usually 3-6 years, depending on what type of specialty.  I think pediatrics is 3 or 4 years.<br>  <br>  In any event, good luck!

baP1ilAWaa	If you're just starting college I would not worry about starting to study the MCAT now. My friends and I call it the "law of diminishing returns,"  by the time your junior year rolls around you will have long forgotten many of the things you studied freshman year. I would say the summer before your junior year or the fall of your junior year would be the perfect time to start studying for the MCAT if you plan on taking it in the spring of that year.<br>  <br>  The best way to prep for the MCAT (in my opinion) is to take practice tests. Going through the pre-medical requirements at most universities will make you cover the material the MCAT tests. The tricky part is actually applying that information appropriately to a test that really measures your reading comprehension more than it tests your knowledge of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Could you do well on the MCAT having never studied these topics? Probably not. However, the reality is you do not need to be an expert in them in order to do well on the MCAT. A lot of the exam is being able to sift through VERY thick science paragraphs and find the information the multiple choice questions are looking for. Practicing taking MCAT exams is an excellent way to learn how to do this.<br>  <br>  In my own experience, I followed my university's plan of taking a Kaplan MCAT prep course that began in the fall of my junior year. My school (Boston College) gave a discount on this course, so I figured I might as well take it. However, I know the Princeton Review course is just as good if not better. The workload of the course was staggering when coupled with my college requirements, so I stopped going. Instead, I took advantage of all of the full length MCAT practice tests Kaplan offered via the course. After taking about 4 or 5 of them (a big commitment when you consider they take 6 or 7 hours), I saw my score steadily increase. This is without studying at all; all I did to prep was take practice exams. In the end, I ended up with a 31 which was good enough to get me into medical school. However, before you jump on this approach, I should warn you that I was a ferocious studier in college and probably wouldn't have benefited much from studying anymore outside of classes. If you don't take your pre-med classes quite as seriously, refreshing by taking a full MCAT prep course would be best. Also, a 31 is good but not outstanding. If you're shooting to get into Harvard or Stanford, you would want to score around a 35 (thus, you would want to study much more than I did).<br>  <br>  Finally, if I have any advice for an incoming college freshman looking at medical school it's this: ENJOY YOURSELF. College is a blast and goes by fast enough already. Do well in your courses (especially sciences classes), and try to find your passion. If it's medicine, awesome. If not, it's not the end of the world. Be happy before being a successful MCAT-taker. Becoming a physician is a tough road, but it can also be very fulfilling. The best way to get to medical school is finding a balance between grades/MCAT scores and enjoying what may be the best four years of your life. Good luck!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The MCAT tests are notoriously difficult. In theory you can score a 45 but in practice the average grade for the smart kids who take this test is only about 27. That's pretty hard!<br>  <br>  You can't really study for the MCAT per se because the test involves a lot of thought questions based on having a thorough knowledge of physics, chemistry, organic chemistry and biology. So, what you need to do is to study really hard on those subjects to try to really understand them completely. If you do really well in all four of these subjects and then review before you do your MCAT in your Jr or Sr year of college, then you will be in good shape. If you get about a 31 or better on the MCAT then you will have a good chance of getting in to some med school. <br>  <br>  This process takes a lot of dedication, but if you have the will power to do it, you will succeed. <br>  <br>  ps When you get to college, be sure to check in with the premed advisor right away. In fact, you should probably check in with him/her before you arrive in order tog et advice about what Freshman courses to take.

Esse momento é considerado como um importante período de transi??o envolvendo as estruturas feudo capitalistas.<br>  As bases desse movimento eram proporcionadas por uma corrente filosófica reinante, o humanismo, que descartava a escolástica medieval, até ent?o predominante, e propunha o retorno às virtudes da antiguidade.

Come?ou no século XIV na Itália e difundiu-se pela pela Europa no decorrer dos séculos XV e XVI.<br>  <br>  Além de atingir a Filosofia, as Artes e as Ciências, o Renascimento fez parte de uma ampla gama de transforma??es culturais, sociais, econ?micas, políticas e religiosas que caracterizam a transi??o do Feudalismo para o Capitalismo. Nesse sentido, o Renascimento pode ser entendido como um elemento de ruptura, no plano cultural, com a estrutura medieval.<br>  <br>  O Renascimento Cultural manifestou-se primeiro nas cidades italianas, de onde se difundiu para todos os países da Europa Ocidental. Porém, o movimento apresentou maior express?o na Itália. N?o obstante, é importante conhecer as manifesta??es renascentistas da Inglaterra, Alemanha, Países Baixos, e menos intensamente, de Portugal e E Características da Cultura Renascentista <br>  - Explicadas detalhadamente os 4 princípios básicos do Renascimento: Racionalismo, Experimentalismo, Individualismo e Antropocentrismospanha|`|0ad79f26141700ab8fcd6df642250f55aa	Contexto Histórico - O Renascimento.<br>  <br>            O Renascimento, importante movimento de renova??o cultural ocorrido na Europa durante os séculos XV e XVI, é considerado o marco inicial da era moderna.<br>  <br>            A base desse movimento encontra-se no crescimento gradativo da burguesia comercial e das atividades econ?micas entre as cidades européias. Esse desenvolvimento estimulou a vida urbana e o surgimento de um novo homem, cujo valor n?o se apoia mais no nome da família mas no prestígio adquirido por seus próprio esfor?o e talento, contribuindo para o enriquecimento do ambiente cultural. As expedi??es oceanicas, por sua vez, alargaram a vis?o do homem europeu, pondo-o em contato com povos de culturas diferentes. O desenvolvimento da matemática e do método experimental propiciaram o surgimento das bases da ciência moderna.<br>  <br>            Gra?as aos humanistas, numerosas obras gregas e latinas, de assunto literário, filosófico e científico, foram traduzidas e difundidas. A filologia desenvolveu-se; surgiram as primeiras gramáticas das línguas modernas. O pensamento da época nutria-se da filosofia grega e das realiza??es artísticas, patrocinadas cada vez mais por ricos comerciantes (os burgueses), inspirava-se nas obras da Antiguidade Clássica.<br>  <br>            Todas essas atividades resultaram na forma??o de um clima intelectual otimista e confiante na for?a do ser humano, que se torna o centro do universo, "a medida de todas as coisas". O Renascimento constituiu, pois, um dos mais prósperos movimentos intelectuais do Ocidente, mudando a imagem que o homem tinha de si mesmo.<br>  <br>            O Renascimento n?o apresentou as mesmas características em todos os lugares em que se desenvolveu. Rico e fecundo, adquiria aspectos diferentes à medida que saía de Floren?a, na Itália, onde surgiu em meados do século XV, e se difundia pelo resto da Europa. No entanto, apesar desta diversidade, manifesta sempre uma característica comum: a ruptura, em maior ou menor grau, com a tradi??o feudal, marcadamente religiosa e teocêntrica.<br>  <br>            O século XVI também foi marcado por dois movimentos religiosos que tiveram funda repercurss?o social e cultural: a Reforma Protestante, liderada por Martinho Lutero, na Alemanha, e a Reforma Católica (também chamada de Contra-Reforma), movimento de rea??o da Igreja de Roma.<br>  <br>            Na verdade, antes mesmo que Lutero desencadeasse uma vigorosa rea??o contra os abusos da Igreja de Roma, muitos católicos já tinham prostestado contra essa situa??o, particularmente o humanista Erasmo (1465-1536), que, em seu livro O Elogio da Loucura, de 1511, faz uma crítica ferina da sociedade da época, ridicularizando inclusive membros corruptos do clero católico.

There are several very good books that explain the whole process, list the 4000 colleges in the USA, and give you good advice on choosing a school, getting admitted, getting the money to pay for it, and how to stay in once you get there. <br>  <br>  A few days reading in the library will answer all your questions with reliable answers that you can depend on, not the nonsense that people usually post around here!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	In your senior year of high school, apply to colleges.  You need a 4-year college degree to apply to medical school (to be either a doctor or a surgeon), and you can do that degree pretty much anywhere in anything.  Pre-med courses are taught everywhere, and aren't a major, just a course sequence to prepare you for the medical school entrance exams.<br>  <br>  So, basically, high school -> 4-year college or university -> MCAT exam -> medical school (4 years) -> residency (3 years) -> probably additional training -> getting a job.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are eight Ivy league universities and they range from quite small to small.  All of them together enroll much less than 20,000 freshmen each year, while in the whole USA more than 2,000,000 freshmen start university... so they are only a small part of the US college system. Because they are so famous they get many thousands of applications for admission from the best students in the USA - Harvard, for instance, gets well over 20,000 applications including over 3000 applications from students ranked #1 in their high school. But only about 1200 will become Freshmen at Harvard. So, that's a pretty difficulty competition. American students are eligible for a lot of different scholarships, but in general international students have to pay the price of tuition and fees. At the Ivy League schools this year, that would be about $50,000 USD per year, plus the cost of living in the USA during the time when school is not in session. <br>  <br>  Besides the Ivy League there are about 10 or so other elite private universities in the USA. Most commonly mentioned in rankings lists are Stanford, Duke, University of Chicago, and a few others, plus of course the great technical universities such as MIT and Caltech. But, the vast majority of American students do not attend these schools. THey are only for the very best students.

You need to be careful - only the Registrar or Dean of your college can answer this question, but in the college I taught at, part time students could NOT live in the dorms, And what's more, if you drop from Full-time to part time you could lose your scholarship - or even worse, your student loans could come due and you would have to start paying them off! <br>  <br>  You need to check with your Registrar and your Financial Aid office before you drop any course that would leave you with less credits than you need for Full time status.!<br>  <br>  |`|8i5MnxWPaa	Did you pay up front?

It has lots of information about med school requirements and links to every school. <br>  <br>  Of course, first you have to get through your BS degree. That means taking a lot of tough undergrad courses like organic chem and getting pretty close to straight A's. The better ranked your undergrad school is, the better chance you will have to get into med school, if your grades are good. Some schools which have very good records for getting their premed students into med school would be Duke, UNC -Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, Emory, U of VA, etc. in the Southeast, and in the Midwest, schools like U of Chicago, Grinnell, Beloit, Purdue, Notre Dame, Case, etc... <br>  <br>  When you arrive at college each of these schools has an expert advisor who specializes in advising and coaching premed students so that they will be able to make a plan to maximize their chance of med school admission. <br>  <br>  Good luck. |`|EdDOBUC1aa	Take your pick.

Just dump them, give the students a book instead and then a few months later hand them a degree.... I'm sure the college administrators who run the food service and dorms would be able to decide whether the students had learned the material or not... and they could also decide what was appropriate for the students to learn in the first place.

The University of Chicago is famous for having the toughest undergraduate courses of any school. There is a famous saying about U Chicago "Where fun comes to die." because the kids there work so hard that they don't take time to have fun like other college kids. THat is an exaggeration, of course. But it is a place where the faculty give very tough, long assignments, and where the students are very serious about learning. Another saying about U of Chi is that they are the "teacher of teachers" because so many of their students become Professors and teachers at other schools later in life. <br>  <br>  You cannot do well at U Chicago unless you truly love to learn, love to study and love to argue and discuss what you are learning. In the end, you will have mastered what you are studying and will ready to compete against any student from any other college. A friend of mine who teaches at Yale Medical school said that they love the U Chi kids who come there because they are the only ones who understand from the beginning how to work at med school pace. <br>  <br>  To become a grad student at U Chicago, you will need to be the absolute best you can be. <br>  <br>  Good luck. 
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Admission at Harvard is "need blind" - that means that the people who are deciding whether to admit you will not know anything about your family wealth. They will not know whether you are rich or poor. After you are admitted, then the Harvard guys will examine your situation to see whether there are any available scholarships. There are not too many scholarships for international students, so you could be out of luck. <br>  <br>  Harvard receives about 25000 applications a year from student in the USA and around the world. Only about 1200 make it to campus. So, if you want to get in there, you have to be one of the best students in the world. Probably about five or six British kids a year get admitted. If you are one of the top ten or so students in Britain, then you have a fighting chance of getting into Harvard. <br>  <br>  Good luck with that! <br>  <br>  |`|OtI4tviYaa	You don't HAVE to be rich, but you do have to be smart.

OK, so you are not going to be the smartest guy in the university. So what?  You are disciplined, you are a good student, and you have the will to succeed. You might not get straight A's, but you will be able to compete and the fact that you have a Duke degree will help you to get into the grad school you want. <br>  <br>  Don't pass up the chance to have a fabulous four years at one of the great educational institutions of the world!

I want to go here two years, get the AA, and then go to NYU or USC. I want to do journalism and acting. I'm a freshman so I'm going to apply next year. When you go there two years you get a AA, then you get a BA after four. Most people transfer after two because that is the smart thing to do. I want to let you know that you may not get a high school diploma, it depends on your school. You won't need it because this would be ahead of a high school diploma. You don't have to take the SATS, but may take it when you transfer. I would call them and talk to your admissions there ASAP. They helped me a lot, and I talked to her today for a half an hour. Good Luck!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	One of my kids was interested in this school so I took him over there to look around. Once he saw what it looked like and what the campus was like, he totally changed his mind and decided it was not the place for him. He wound up at a top ten school in the middle of a big city. <br>  <br>  It might be a good school, but if you are going to take a couple years out of your life, you better go there and see what it's like. <br>  <br>  Good luck! 
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There is a reason why Harvard is routinely listed as the best or one of the very best universities in the world. They have the most money, the most famous professors, the best students, by far the best network of alumni and friends, and a campus with everything you could possible want in the way of library or research facilities, etc. It is a very bad joke for someone from Smith College to criticize Harvard -as if Smith was something to brag about! Or, for someone to criticize Harvard because Boston gets cold and has snow for a couple months in the winter. What kind of a loser would pick their school based on that! That's pathetic. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you have to choose a school based on whether it is right for you, not on what its reputation is. Harvard students are typically extraordinarily good students. Almost every one of them was a Valedictorian from a really good high school or somehow proved that they were an outstanding student - by winning some national award, or otherwise getting national attention. You cannot fit in at Harvard unless you are exceptionally smart, exceptionally hardworking, exceptionally well educated, and exceptionally creative. Frankly, that means that most home schooled kids don't measure up. <br>  <br>  If you are admitted to Harvard, there are a VERY large number of different scholarships that you can apply for. Chances are, if you can get in, then you will be able to find the money to pay for the costs. I've never heard of anyone who was admitted to Harvard who dropped out because they couldnt find the cash. <br>  <br>  Since you admit that you are not the best student, it seems unlikely to me that you can get into Harvard. But there are lots of other very good schools. You have a while before you apply to college so you have plenty of time to go on the chat boards and read what people have to say about the different colleges. I thinkyou will be able to find a school that matches your SAT scores, your interests, and your financial resources. <br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|14pjwQPLaa	Why Harvard?  I mean, it's a good school and all that, but it is NOT the Holy Grail!  You don't even know if you'd be happy there, and Boston winters are MISERABLE.<br>  <br>  Anyway -- Harvard only awards academic scholarships.  Ipso facto, you must be the absolute best in scholarship and potential.  You must have an demonstrably inquiring mind as evidenced by precocious research, or an outstanding talent in which you passionately excel. You must show that you, and you alone, will be an asset to Harvard's collection of talented individuals. Home schooled kids DO get into Harvard, but it's usually because they were intellectually advanced in the first place and their parents were intellectually gifted enough to be able to provide sufficient intellectual stimulation and structure things to allow the student to pursue a passion (i.e., in biochemical research, etc,)  If you're just wandering through Geometry and taking a few Bible classes now, that's not going to cut it.<br>  <br>  High grades are not enough.  Harvard turns down class valedictorians from around the world on a regular basis.  High SATs are not enough -- there are 2400 kids who get turned down, if they don't have the grades or extra curriculars to support being able to make a contribution to Harvard's educational mystique.<br>  <br>  Don't know how old you are, but if you haven't hit high school yet, then you have a chance to recover.  If you're in high school with Bs now, then you are probably not Harvard material.  If you can't excel in high school, how to do you expect to make any sort of meaningful contribution to Harvard life?<br>  <br>  And what if you wanted to be an engineer?  Harvard isn't necessarily the best school for engineers!<br>  <br>  Set your sights on a more reasonable goal -- a full ride at any of the top 50 schools in the country would be quite an achievment. <br>  |`|SqvU8U2Waa	You really cannot get a full ride to Harvard without either having some very well known Alumni parents, a ridiculous amount of AP classes with a 4.0 average and a 5 score on the AP tests, along with some amazing SAT and ACT scores. sorry but what you want is damn near impossible, especially for a home schooled kid.|`|xlYyWWsmaa	You have two separate issues here:<br>  <br>  1. Getting into Harvard-- Harvard is NOT the best school, contrary to popular belief and despite its ridiculously difficult application process. Have you done your research? There are good schools that are highly competitive without the ridiculous application process and tough admissions requirements. If you're looking to get into a good, private school I suggest Welsley, Smith, Columbia, Barnard. (three of these are private women's schools) I went to Smith College and they offer a lot of financial aid and scholarships for qualified applicants. (just check their website). If you're really set on Harvard, you must take the SATs, must have a strong, impressive GPA (i.e.: 3.8+), show a significant amount of academic success, be well-rounded in other realms of life (i.e.: clubs, sports, civic leadership). <br>  <br>  2. Paying for Harvard--Say you DO get into Harvard, you will need to show a significant amount of financial need to be completely covered. Your parents must be destitute and you must show that you would significantly contribute academically to Harvard if given the opportunity. This is very unlikely. You will probably need to get a loan, which is NOT a bad thing. My whole education has been on loans. Think of it as an investment in your education. Try applying for outside scholarships too. (Google them for more information)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  matt-- that is very presumptuous of you to say that Smith is "nothing to brag about". Harvard is only listed as one of the top in the US because of a very silly and rudimentary scale used to rate colleges/universities. The only reason why there are at the top is because of a long and extensive network of old money and wealthy, giving alums. That is the only reason they are ranked number one, not by their academic expectations and standards. Furthermore, Smith is a very small, historic women's college. Just because U.S. News decided to rank us lower than Harvard doesn't mean that our particular academic program stinks, it simply indicates that Smith tends to admit intelligent and talented individuals with REAL academic need. Moreover, our smaller network together with a less "old money" community of alumna results in less alum giving. We're not as concerned with making money than other colleges/universities, focusing our efforts of educating women of promise, not from long-standing, impressive genealogies. <br>  Matt--If you're going to make a broad statement about a college you know nothing about, then please...think about doing your research or shut up.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	U of C has about 1000 kids in their freshman class, so 1% means that about ten kids had scores of 18 or 19. They may have been international kids who are brilliant but still a little less than perfect in their English, or inner city kids who did really well even though they were from severely deprived backgrounds. Or they may have been disabled kids who have problems manipulating ACT forms. They may have taken both ACT and SAT and scored 2400s on SAT. There are all kinds of reasons why kids with a relatively low ACT could be admitted. <br>  <br>  U of Chi has always been famous for having a quirky admissions system... they called it their "Uncommon Application."   If you are thinking of going to U of Chi, don't worry, you are going to find plenty of smart kids to hang around with, and if you make it through, you will have a degree that everyone int he world respects. |`|tiHr87ZZaa	it all depends on the group of applicants they receive each year.<br>  one year, everyone might have scored 27 or higher on the ACT, therefore they picked those students, and as they went down the line, only a few with low scores got in.<br>  <br>  U. of Chicago is a fantastic school, so I doubt that they would really accept ANYONE with an ACT lower than 20, only if they had good extracurriculars or something.<br>  <br>  So, the next year, the people who applied for a freshman class had ACT scores all over the place. Therefore, their best picks (based on grades, extracurriculars, etc) might have had lower ACT scores.<br>  
1hEkvBzvaa	I am also pre-pharm! I also work with pharmacists as a pharmacy tech and let me tell you it's not easy! It normally takes 8 years to become a pharmacist. If you are particularily gifted you may be able to do it in 6. They now require pharmacists to earn a pharmD, so it's 4 years of graduate school, with the last year being almost like a residency (they make you pay graduate tuition so you can work 40 hours a week with no pay!!). In pharmacy school you learn about interactions, how the drugs work, pharmacy laws, etc. It might be a lot of work, but all the pharmacists I work with say it is well worth it. |`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	For info about careers in pharmacy check the website of the AACP - that is the official group that coordinates info about all accredited pharm schools in the USA.<br>  <br>  Pharmacy is chemistry, so you need to be really good in chemistry. There is quite a lot of memorizing (thousands of drugs!) and a lot of the work is pretty complicated (learning about all the different complications in heart medicines and cancer medicines). Pharmacy is not a good choice for anyone who is careless or has trouble remembering details. In pharmacy, if you screw up a detail, then you could kill someone. You have to be a very responsible person to be a pharmacist. <br>  
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Surgery is a medical specialty. You must get into med school before you can start to do any surgical training. To get into medical school you can choose any major you want as long as you complete all the premed prerequisites. Most premed kids major in chem or bio because that's what they like - science. IF you are still in high school then your best preparation is to work really hard on your chemistry and math because that is the toughest hurdle in college, organic chem and calculus/physics. If you can get A in those courses then you have a fighting chance of getting into med school.<br>  <br>  For details on med schools, check the website of the AAMC - that is the association of american med colleges.

That wouldn't work, eh?<br>  <br>  OK, there are at least two very famous Colleges of Culinary Arts that are fully accredited and will both teach you to be a skilled chef, and also get you a respected college degree at the same time. That would be the Culinary Institute of America in NY and Johnson & Wales University (Providence, Denver, Miami and Charlotte).<br>  <br>  Both of these schools have websites that explain all about their degree programs in culinary arts. I'm sure you can sign up at the website to get more information sent out to you. <br>  <br>  The important thing about these schools is that they are fully accredited.

Those are good suggestions, but also what about radio- not just AM-FM radio but the whole idea of broadcasting which led to TV, radar, cell phones, blueray, etc... Also, the whole paraphernalia of electrical systems with generators, wiring, fuses and everything that is needed to allow people to use electricity in their homes... Edison did the lightbulb in 1879 but the first real commercial lightbulbs and lighting systems came after 1880, especially the White City at the 1893 Chicago Exposition. Also, lots of improvements and advances in construction and design... hardly any big buiildings before 1880, lots of skyscrapers by 1910... small naval vessels in 1880, giant battleships by 1910. Tremendous improvements in transport - new bridges, modern subways, concrete and asphalt highways, the use of petroleum for fuel (almost unknownin 1880, common in 1910) with deep oil wells and pipeline transport. <br>  <br>  For some interesting guys who were involved in all this, check out Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, or Marconi|`|0EtXLe1jaa	wright brothers took flight in 1900.<br>  <br>  ford motors founded in 1903.

lzEuuseJaa	So you're in 7th now if I understand you correctly. It looks like Rye is quite academic, so you need to keep your grades way up and you need to do really great on the ISEE or the SSAT. Look at test prep books for both tests, test locations, differences, and decide which one you want to take. Then go through the test prep books, work a little almost every week, like learning new vocab words, until next December when you should take it. A couple months before the test, take practice tests to get down the timing.<br>  <br>  Rather than try to do too many extracurriculars, find a couple of things, like one instrument and one sport (unless you're really good in more than one) to focus on. What is your thing? See if you can use that to your advantage as an extracurricular. <br>  <br>  Do community service, like helping to feed the homeless or cleaning up at a local food bank. Try to do one day every month. The school's motto is "Not for self, but for service." so you want to make sure you have some community service on your resume. Here is their list of some of the organizations they have helped, for volunteer ideas: <a href="http://www.ryecountryday.org/page.cfm?p=739" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryecountryday.org/page.cfm?p=...</a><br>  <br>  Keep a resume of your awards, community service, leadership (team captain, student council, scout mentor, etc), performing arts, extracurriculars, sports, etc. Your teachers will need that information when they write up your recommendations. <br>  <br>  Just a guess, but it looks like they only admit around 10 - 15 students for 9th, you can call and ask how many. The economy very likely won't impact admissions much, it might cut out a very few applicants, but there are likely several to many applicants per space. The economy may impact financial aid a bit. <br>  <br>  You should also look at other schools as back ups. In a competitive market, like NY or LA, generally counselors advise students apply to 3 or 4, maybe 5 if your grades and scores aren't great and you really want to go to private school. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12021966	Learn how to spell and then they'll take you seriously.

AA11589437	In Greece, correct. In the US, I don't know.
AA12263007	I still have some in my fridge. No, seriously. The former soviet union mainly split apart because of lack of centralization of the government. The irony is that this doesn't comply with the ideology of communism. If the main sectors of the society is controlled by the government then vioula, Communism funny as it may seem some of the countries in the Soviet republic didn't accept these guidelines. There was a general lack of communication and well things like this are inevitable in the politics world, remember the blood and iron theoy..."What goes up must come down" And what I said above is by far the worst case senario of the disads of socialism. Communism is a type of government which advocates sharing of wealth, this can only happen when there is enough confidence and energy stored in the society to accept these guidelines. It is much like the stock markets, Confidence in shares and markets results in the incline of market bussiness. But politics and Bussines are really different. Well before I tell you the type of government they constructed I want to tell you what happened in the brink of failure.

This was a huge confusing problem when I was going through graduate school decisions and applications.<br>  <br>  Rule 1: Don't listen to it unless it sounds right to yourself.

There's no real way to know what job you want to do until you start to try different things and see how it goes.  It's great that you have ideas already and your mind SHOULD change as time goes on.  Right now is a great time to start to think about these things and think about how different things you're learning will help in these fields you're interested in.

31MhGY6Daa	this teacher of yours is deeply concerned about your well being. If not, she wouldn't have gone through all the trouble just to check up on you. remember, she has her own life to live aside from her life as a teacher but nonetheless, she still exerted an effort to talk to you, to call your mom, and i believe that there are still quite a lot of things that she has done for you. Don't hate her for the things she has been or is doing. If there is anyone to hate, it should be your other teachers for they have failed in doing their duty to bring you up as an independent and whole student.<br>  Try to understand what your teacher is feeling. Open up to her because from what I've read above, I can tell that she is really worried about you and I believe that every sane teacher in this world would only want what is best for her student.|`|dq0L2jsAaa	I can  assure you dear that this teacher is very much concerned about you, cares about you. One thing you need to understand that what does he/she stands to lose if he/she ignores you as a lost case as others hv taken it for granted. It is you who will lose and she/he doesn't want that to happen. Also, concern or care (when the situation doesn't affect the teacher) comes out of love. Your teacher is trying his/her best in carrying out her/his duty by going an extra mile with you, may be two. So, Plz share with your teacher your problem, ur interest and most importantly trust him/her. God bless you. Thanks.

In other words, the kingship won't stay in Macbeth's line with his kids being kings after him. To remedy this, Macbeth decides to have Banquo and his son killed so they can't take the kingship from him.

O4oCqaKkaa	Macbeth says to Lady Macbeth, "Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, / Till thou applaud the deed."  He is telling her that he doesn't want her to know until after the deed and then she'll be pleased with what he's done.   There are a couple possible reasons for why he isn't telling her.  It could be that he wants her to be proud of him for having the ability to plan and carry out a murder on his own.  In Act 1, sc. 7, when Macbeth suggests to his wife that they not go through with the murder of Duncan, she essentially calls him a wimp.  She attacks his masculinity and her tactic worked because Macbeth decides to go along with her.  She is the one who devised the plan, too. So it is entirely possible that he is trying to impress her.  Another possible reason for not telling Lady Macbeth of his plan to have Banquo and Fleance killed is "plausible deniability", but I have more belief in the first reason.|`|31MhGY6Daa	in the previous scenes, Lady Macbeth has always been the one planning and deciding things. Macbeth in this scene wants to be independent. The explanation for this is more of like a change in character in his part.

QbcnDDxUaa	Antiserum (plural: antisera) is blood serum containing polyclonal antibodies. Antiserum is used to pass on passive immunity to many diseases. Passive antibody transfusion from a previous human survivor is the only effective treatment for Ebola infection.<br>  [edit]How it works<br>  <br>  Antibodies in the antiserum bind the infectious agent or antigen. The immune system then recognizes foreign agents bound to antibodies and triggers a more robust immune response. The use of antiserum is particularly effective against pathogens which are capable of evading the immune system in the unstimulated state but which are not robust enough to evade the stimulated immune system. The existence of antibodies to the agent therefore depends on an initial "lucky survivor" whose immune system by chance discovered a counteragent to the pathogen, or a "host species" which carries the virus but does not suffer from its effects. Further stocks of antiserum can then be produced from the initial donor or from a donor organism that is inoculated with the pathogen and cured by some stock of preexisting antiserum.<br>  Mutations in the pathogen can decrease or eliminate the effectiveness of antiserum.<br>  <br>  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiserum <br>  www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286...<br>  www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Anti...
lPdCTyOAaa	Is your major pre-PT?  You might be better off getting a regular major (Bio, Kinesiology, Chemistry) and doing any pre-PT requirements on top of that.<br>  <br>  The DPT is the new standard for entry-level PTs.  Part of the reason is inflation/prestige.  Another big part of it is money.  There is the hope that transitioning the standard to DPT will help to enable "direct access", whereby patients could go to a PT for patient without the need for a prescription from an MD.  Chiropractors already enjoy direct access, which is useful for business reasons in addition to prestige.<br>  <br>  Not every school offers the DPT, but everyone is going that way.  CSU schools with MPT programs are at a disadvantage, as the CSU system does not offer doctorates (in anything, by law).  Most likely, they will get around this by setting up a partnership with the nearest UC that is without a PT school.  Out of 210 PT schools in this country, 195 offer a DPT and only 15 offer MPT.<br>  <br>  Younger PTs who only have the Masters are increasingly finding themselves doing online or part-time programs to "upgrade" their degree to a "transition DPT".  Honestly, you don't want to deal with that.  Restrict your applications to DPT programs only.  Older PTs are less likely to feel the need to upgrade, but they have the substitute of years of experience.  You won't have that luxury.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that being a PT requires a lot of continuing ed.  Maybe you want to add a clinical specialty...those exams are exceptionally demanding.  Do you really want to waste your time redoing what you could have done in PT school?<br>  <br>  There are PT schools all over the country.  If you want to stay in California, UCSF is probably the best option, as it is a great school and maybe gives the benefit of in-state tuition.  The only CSU campuses with PT schools are Long Beach, CSUN, Fresno, and Sac State.|`|W1tx1p2iaa	I agree.  New grads with the masters will be at a disadvantage.  The 15 programs or so need to change over by 2020 but it should happen sooner than that.  I initally fought the DPT thing but became a convert.  I went back even with over 13 years experience.  The learning was amazing.  Now students are doing way may clinical time then we ever did.  They are coming out better prepared.  Over the past 6 years, I have mentored new grads with both a masters and a DPT.  The DPT grads are much more self starters.  They are going to come to you with the evidence before asking a question.  At work, I was the first to get my DPT.  We have since hired DPTs and others have gone back.   We are the ones that my boss comes to for projects and inservice training.  I am not saying that all PT who have BS and MS should go back when they have 8 plus years of experience currently but if you are in school go for the doctorate.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|BBht4bGsaa	Talk to the advisors and professors in your department.  They'll know what to do.<br>  <br>  A lot of programs have been adjusting their Masters programs and awarding Doctorates.  Point there is that each program at each school will stand on its own merit not the title.<br>  <br>  (Justified or not, it's inflation, frankly.)
AA10829445	I think you're asking what an Oscar winner receives when they win?  Actually, they receive the gold plated statue, literally.  But, there is an intrinsic prize that's included with a win;  the great publicity, the notice & praise of your peers, etc.  But most of all your asking price goes up and you can earn more money per picture after you win a nomination.  On the other hand, if you don't continue with good roles, you will be soon forgotten and your asking price (salary) will go down & you will be offered less & smaller roles.  Many Oscar nominated actors & even winners are reduced to guest appearances on TV shows;  some lucky enough to get shows of  their own.  Some stars like Will Smith have never won an Oscar but have had blockbuster movies one after the other and don't need the award to be successful.  Others never live up to their one and only win;  i.e., Geena Davis, Mira Sorvino, Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin, Helen Hunt, Adrian Brody & that Italian actor, Bigini or something like that who won & jumped up on the seats for "Life is Beautiful" --never heard of again.  <br>  <br>  To answer your indirect question - there is no money awarded with the statue.  The statue is supposed to be important enough on its own.

0U6fSHGOaa	On the afternoon of June 10 - 11, 323 BC, Alexander died of a mysterious illness in the palace of Nebuchadrezzar II of Babylon. He was just one month shy of attaining 33 years of age. Various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include poisoning by the sons of Antipater or others, sickness that followed a drinking party, or a relapse of the malaria he had contracted in 336 BC.<br>  It is known that on May 29, Alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend Medius of Larissa. After some heavy drinking, immediately before or after a bath, he was forced into bed due to severe illness. The rumors of his illness circulated with the troops causing them to be more and more anxious. On June 9, the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time. They were admitted to his presence one at a time. While the king was too ill to speak, confined himself to move his hand. The day after, Alexander was dead.<br>  The poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by Justin and Curtius. The original story stated that Cassander, son of Antipater, viceroy of Greece, brought the poison to Alexander in Babylon in a mule's hoof, and that Alexander's royal cupbearer, Iollas, brother of Cassander, administered it. Many had powerful motivations for seeing Alexander gone, and were none the worse for it after his death. Deadly agents that could have killed Alexander in one or more doses include hellebore and strychnine. In R. Lane Fox's opinion, the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world, such long-acting poisons were probably not available.<br>  However, the warrior culture of Macedon favoured the sword over strychnine, and many ancient historians, like Plutarch and Arrian, maintained that Alexander was not poisoned, but died of natural causes. Instead, it is likely that Alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever, which were rampant in ancient Babylon. Other illnesses could have also been the culprit, including acute pancreatitis or the West Nile virus. Recently, theories have been advanced stating that Alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease. Hellebore, believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses, may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery, with deadly results. Disease-related theories often cite the fact that Alexander's health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds (including one in India that nearly claimed his life), and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness or another finally killed him.<br>  No story is conclusive. Alexander's death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries, and each generation offers a new take on it. What is certain is that Alexander died of a high fever on June 10 or 11 of 323 BC.<br>  On his death bed, his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom. Since Alexander had no heir (his son Alexander IV would be born after his death), it was a question of vital importance. There is some debate to what Alexander replied. Some believe that Alexander said, "To the strongest!". It should be taken into note however that he might have said, "To Craterus". This is possible because the Greek pronunciation of "the strongest" and "Craterus" is different only by accent. The phrase and name are in fact, separated by only one letter in the ancient Greek language. Most scholar's believe that if Alexander did intend to choose one of his generals, his obvious choice would've been Craterus because he was the commander of the largest part of the army (infantry), because he had proven himself to be an excellent strategist, and because he displayed traits of the "ideal" Macedonian. Regardless of his reply, Craterus was eventually assassinated before he could organize a coup with the infantry and Alexander's empire was split into 4 kingdoms.<br>  <br>  Alexander's death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life. Before long, accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another, making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half-truths from the actual events. No contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level of self-serving recording, and as a result what truly happened to Alexander the Great may never be known.<br>  Alexander's body was placed in a gold anthropid sarcophagus, which was in turn placed in a second gold casket and covered with a purple robe. Alexander's coffin was placed, together with his armour, in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an Ionic peristyle. The decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by Diodoros.<br>  According to legend, Alexander was preserved in a clay vessel full of honey (which acts as a|`|ybexjS2Paa	The reason of his death is still unknown.

He went on a boating trip while at Babylon, in summer, when the marshes of the river were full of fever. To add to all this, he had engaged in another of his notorious drinking bouts the night before. <br>  <br>  Alexander the Great died of a fever 13 June 323. For four days there was silence in Babylon, in shock and mourning. His body was conveyed to Alexandria in Egypt, where it was buried.

We are typically the worst in Franklin County of Ohio. We are in a budget cut, so there are literally no new books since like 89'. Only new ones are the required ones for P.O.D.. There will probably [probably] be no busing next year, they are cutting some teachers, a couple of security guards, and Tryouts for a sport will be $50. Along with cutting away random drug tests. I don't see this getting better. The ethnicity can range about anywhere. There are African Americans, Both Gangster, and non. We have Asians, which don't neccessarily do any harm. We have Caucasians, which are the Same level as African American Cliques. We just don't have a lot of grace since the board added split sessions, to raise more attendance in school in 05' (Possibly 300 to 2500) so it is very contagious to want  to rebel. xD<br>  <br>  (Individual/ Group Work/ Activities)<br>  Well there is about anything typically found in a school around here in Ohio. Baseball, Football, Soccer, Basketball, Track & Field, Wrestling, Bowling, and Choir / Band. I myself didn't want to be in any of these activities, because of the drama of someone in the cliques who would decide to be an arrogant prick, since being in such a low grade school, they have typically no knowledge. Mainly anyone who has room to talk , doesn't. They are the least to talk.<br>  <br>  It's merely funny. <br>  I however, decided to take choir, since I play guitar, I figured singing would help with my leverage of becoming a composer, musician, and hopefully a teacher.

2BpkXSnqaa	THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF:<br>  The Boy Who Cried Wolf, also known as The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf, is a fable attributed to Aesop. The protagonist of the fable is a bored shepherd boy who entertained himself by calling out "Wolf!". Nearby villagers who came to his rescue found that the alarms were false and that they had wasted their time. When the boy was actually confronted by a wolf, the villagers did not believe his cries for help and the wolf ate the flock (and in some versions the boy). The moral is stated at the end of the fable as:Even when liars tell the truth, they are never believed. The liar will lie once, twice, and then perish when he tells the truth.<br>  <br>  THE CAT AND THE MICE:<br>  The Cat and the Mice is a fable attributed to Aesop. It tells the story of a house full of mice, and the cat who hunts them. After the cat catches several of them, the remaining mice retreat into their holes. The cat tries to fool them by playing dead, but the mice don't fall for it. The moral of the story is that the wise are not tricked by the innocence of those previously found to be dangerous.<br>  <br>  THE FOX AND THE GRAPES:<br>  A fox, upon failing to find a way to reach grapes hanging high up on a vine, retreated and said: "The grapes are sour anyway!"

After failing to push over the pitcher, the crow devises a clever plan: it drops in pebbles, one by one, until the water rises to the top of the pitcher, allowing the crow to drink.The moral is stated at the end of the fable as:Thoughtfulness is superior to brute strength.Necessity is the mother of invention<br>  <br>  THE GREEDY DOG:<br>  The Dog and the Bone is a fable ascribed to Aesop. According to the story, a dog was carrying a bone over a bridge. Looking down into the water, the dog saw its own reflection, which looked to him like another dog carrying another bone. Wanting the other dog's bone as well as his own, the dog opened his mouth to bark at the "other" dog it saw, but in doing so, the dog dropped his own bone into the river, where it was gone for good.The sad, hungry dog learned the hard lesson that, by being greedy, one risks what one already has.<br>  <br>  THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE:<br>  One day a hare saw a tortoise walking slowly along and began to laugh and mock him. The hare challenged the tortoise to a race and the tortoise accepted. They agreed on a route and started off the race. The hare shot ahead and ran briskly for some time. Then seeing that he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he'd sit under a tree for some time and relax before continuing the race.He sat under the tree and soon fell asleep. The tortoise, plodding on, overtook him and finished the race. The hare woke up and realized that he had lost the race.The moral, stated at the end of the fable, is, "Slow and steady wins the race."<br>  <br>  THE FROGS WHO DESIRED A KING:<br>  The Frogs Who Desired a King is a fable ascribed to Aesop .According to the story, a group of frogs lived happily and peacefully in a pond. Over time, however, they became discontented with their way of life, and thought they should have a mighty king to rule over them. They called out to the great god Zeus to send them a king.Zeus was amused by the frogs' request, and cast a large log down into their pond, saying "Behold, your king!" At first, the frogs were terrified of the huge log, but after seeing that it did not move, they began to climb upon it. Once they realized the log would not move, they called out again to Zeus to send them a real king, one that moved.Annoyed by the frogs, Zeus said, "Very well, here is your new king," and sent a large stork to the pond. The stork began devouring frogs. In terror, frogs called out to Zeus to save them. Zeus refused, saying the frogs now had what they'd wanted, and had to face the consequences.To some, the simple lesson of the story is "leave well enough alone," or "be careful what you wish for."<br>  <br>  THE FOX AND THE CROW:<br>  "The Fox and the Crow" is a fable attributed to Aesop. In the fable, a crow has found a piece of cheese and has retired to a branch to eat it, when a fox approaches. The fox, wanting the cheese for himself, flatters the crow, calling it beautiful and "the king of birds". Finally the fox requests that the crow sing for him. Its ego inflated by all the flattery, the crow begins to caw. When it opens its beak, the cheese falls and is devoured by the fox.The moral of the fable is "Beware of flatterers."|`|mjSnBgyxaa	Slow and steady wins the race.<br>  This is a famous proverb<br>  and the story related to this proverb<br>  all know very well<br>  The famous story of tortoise and hare<br>  How tortoise wins the race defeating hare by slow but steady movement<br>  <br>  Hope this will help you!

He<br>  replied, "I had not leisure enough.  I passed the days in<br>  singing."

It is about a farmer who plants traps in his corn field to catch cranes. When he checks the traps, he finds among the cranes a stork, who pleads to be spared, because he isn't a crane.

The moral of the story is that associating with bad companions will lead everyone to believe you are bad yourself.<br>  <br>  THE FARMER AND THE VIPER:<br>  "The Farmer and the Viper" is a fable attributed to Aesop.

In the fable, a lion wants to eat a mouse who wakes him up. The mouse begs forgiveness and promises to return the favor if ever he is given the opportunity.

The lion is moved to uncontrollable laughter and when he recovers, lets the mouse go, stating that he has not had such a good laugh in ages.Later, the lion is captured by hunters and tied to a tree; the lion roars with all his might so that someone might help him.

kvfQWRKFaa	Im 24 years old, I know exactly how you feel because I was exactly the same way. What kind of medication are you on? Maybe you should try an A.A.D medicine, or an anti-depressant, or if you are aready on an anti depressant talk to your doctor about getting on a secondary medicine.<br>  As for school DO NOT DROP OUT!!!!!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!. You might not think so now but you will later on and I know this because I regret it. Life is soooooo much harder then school. I was the type of person in school that said F**K school im never going to use this stuff in life, but you do need to have that diploma to get any kind of job. I know ive already stated my age but again im only 24 and would give anything to be back in school again. It basically a care free life, all you have to do is keep your grades up.<br>  I dropped out at 17 and was still sitting in the 9th grade because I just didnt care. So ever since 17 I have been home babysitting (not lisenced) and it sucks, you think you need meds now, staying home all the time may sound cool now but its not fun looking at the same walls every single day being pretty much a house maid. <br>  Now I got pregnant at 17, had my daughter at 18, got married when I was 19, got pregnant again at 20, had my son at 21, and got pregnant again at 22 then had to move back home to my mother in laws house and again pushed out another baby. Granted I love my kids to death and wouldnt trade them for the world. <br>  <br>  THE SAYING IS I WISH I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW. <br>  <br>  Im not saying your going to drop out and have a bunch of kids, but just stay in school and enjoy your youth, you dont want to be older then you are, its no fun. High school doesnt last long, so just stick it out, or talk to your guidence counseler to see if your school offers night school, both of my sisters ended up transferring to night school and went to straight  A's from straight E's. <br>  I hate sounding like im lecturing people, which I know  im doing now but I hate seeing people with same attitude that I use to have and I just want to see other people do different.

TrOEFKikaa	It's been a long time since I studied htis but from what I remember we see Stanhope as a rather wretched and burned out coward at the beginning but he has a chance to suggest the reasons for his fears over the course of the pay and show that whilst he is afraid he does his duty anway, which the author believes makes him a truer hero than those who blindly jump into trouble they don't understand. The playwright might manipulate the audience because this play was shown in the jingoistic 1920s when to make a point like this would have been difficult, he had to fool them into taking an accepted anti-cowardice stance and then reel them in along a persuasive journey to sympathise with the character of Stanhope and thus the values that he represented.

a21ngdX7aa	Maya Angelou’s “Finishing school“, is a literary work full of irony.<br>  <br>  Irony can be seen right from the beginning of the text. You wouldn’t expect someone who went to a finishing school rather than getting a rigorous education to succeed as an author, but Maya Angelou informs us that she went to a finishing school with the use of the line “became my finishing school” (102). If Mrs. Cullinan, who was ugly and barren, could have had children with her husband they probably would have been pretty. It is likely, however, it is also ambiguous if the Coleman girls were the daughters of Mr. Cullinan (Angelou 103). If they were the daughters of Mr. Cullinan, it shows that since they were so pretty, the “spitting image”, of their father, and didn’t look much like their mother, if Mr. & Mrs. Coleman could have had babies they probably would have been pretty (Angelou 103). Margaret used to arrive at work early and leave late but later on she would arrive late and leave early (Angelou 103-104). You wouldn’t expect it after Margaret’s reaction to the new name, Mary, but Glory actually liked her new name (Angelou 104). You also wouldn’t expect Margaret to work for Mrs. Cullinan for a week after Mrs. Cullinan gave her a new name because of what Margaret said about Mrs. Cullinan’s friend who suggested to give her a new name “if I was starving I’d never work for her….” (Angelou 103). Perhaps the most ironic part of the story is that after Margaret broke Mrs. Cullinan’s china because she used the name Mary, Mrs. Cullinan called her Margaret (Angelou 104-105). Just as the story began with irony, and so it ends “The flying crockery caught Miss Glory right over her ear” (Angelou 105).<br>  <br>  Irony was a clear theme in “Finishing School”, especially situational irony.<br>  <br>  <br>  you jump around a lot with your information. if i were you i would aspire to find a way to link your sentences a little more seamlessly, so it would not appear to be going off track all the time

c8lBbWtQaa	If you were a peasant then you probably worked on the land,most of England then was rural, Food you mostly ate Pottage which is like a vegetable stew. Very little meat was eaten you did not earn enough to buy it. you may have had part shares in a pig which grazed common land, & you probably grew your own veggies. You may have gone poaching for rabbits& suchlike but it was a risky business poaching & carried heavy penalties. If you were working for the lord of the manor you would be living in a tied cottage made of stone wood brick or even wattle &daub it would probably be little more than a hovel. Your wife could have died in childbirth the death rate was very high{cleanliness not an issue in 16th century. Also the plague was endemic, appendicitis although they did not call it that, Smallpox measles& diphtheria all killed. The chances are you would be illiterate not many books around & they were mostly in latin You would have worked from sun up to sundown 6 days a week. Here my knowledge runs out hope this helps. Things were starting to change in Britain it was becoming a force to be reckoned with in trade & exploration but you will have to find that out for yourself.

XmdUYCDoaa	The career a parent selects can impact their child in a variety of ways. Any parent who chooses to work while raising a child must balance the pros and cons and find a way to put their child first and ensure that the child is nurtured, loved, and feels protected.<br>  <br>  I <<<<<( you shouldn't be using words like 'i' in an essay, you will nee d to rephrase that maybe to) "It is understandable.."     can understand there are parents that work long hours to provide for the family, >>>(there is no need to put sons and daughters family is fine)  sons and daughters to have the things they need such as, food(a meal) at the table, clothes to wear, a roof on top(over their head) of their head, to provide their child with a good education, put them in  recreational activities >>>>(this bit is silly, the tutor bit.. its not necessary )   or a tutor center so they can get ahead in school. But most of all so that their children can get to have a lifestyle like every other kid and not feel an outcast in life. (this outcast bit is very silly..)<br>  <br>   There are some disadvantages however, if the parents are always away from home and working, the children may feel abandoned, and in need of the parents attention.There also would be little or no communication in the household between the parents and the children. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is not an essay.. an essay NEEDS an introduction<br>  <br>  the introduction includes (in order) <br>  <br>  an interesting point about the topic<br>  <br>  in your case maybe it would be.. <br>  <br>  over a quarter of the worlds population of children a deprived of parent attention. <br>  <br>  next is a thesis. <br>  a thesis is a proposition<br>  i will need to see the question of your essay or hypothesis to do the thesis<br>  <br>  next is any definitions youl need to be covering throughout your essay that readers may be unfamiliar with<br>  <br>  and than finally its your list of points.. your essay should be built in paragraphs, each of your paragraphs should have a topic sentence, the topic sentence makes sure you stick to the point in your paragraphs and don't go of track into topics that are unrelated in the essay. the list of points is a brief outline of the topic sentences<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PARAGRAPHS<br>  <br>  in your paragraphs state a topic sentence for each. and  then elaborate on them, sticking to the topic however<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CONCLUSION<br>  your conclusion should NOT include any new information. It is a conclusion to the essay and gives a general statement and a sum up of your topic sentences.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you may want to consider planning your essay a little more.. brainstorm ideas to obtain topic sentences. There are also different types of essays such as Discussion essays, comparison essays ect. A comparison essay is what id categorize yours in. Comparison essays is just looking at the similarities and the differences (whats the same/ whats different). Also do avoid using words like you/he/she/i <br>  <br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck on your essay <br>  have a great day :D|`|rU6gvHFkaa	hope that gave you a little better idea. good luck<br>  <br>  The career a parent chooses can impact their child in a variety of ways. Parents who choose to work while raising a child must balance the pros and cons to find a way to put their child first and ensure that the child is nurtured, loved, and protected.<br>  <br>  I can understand there are parents that work long hours to provide for their family. Parents want their children to have the things they need such as, food, clothing, a home, security, and a good education. To insure they get the best education the parents should put them in recreational activities or a tutoring center so they can get ahead in school. With a good education their children can have a lifestyle like every other kid and not feel like an outcast in life.<br>  <br>  But there are some downsides to all this as the parents are always away from home and working, their child may feel lonely, and in need of the parent's attention. Also their would be little or no communication in the household.

I took the "Becoming a Master Student" class in college and it truly helped.  Depending on how your memory works, there are several different techniques.  <br>  Anagrams, taking terms by their first letters and arranging those letters into a word.  <br>  Then there's good, old fashioned repetition.  <br>  Reading aloud helps some people, depending on how their memories are stimulated. <br>  When you're taking notes in class, you're actually creating a memory trail.  And when you combine taking notes, rereading the material directly after class, and studying it later, the trail just gets deeper and deeper until you really can't help but remember it.  <br>  Also, there are different note taking methods.  I take mine in outline form - it's a good method but you better be a very dat writer.  Writing just key words, numbered for reference works as well, but be sure to go back later and clarify what you've written while your memory is still fresh.  There are other methods but they require a demonstration as opposed to me telling you.  You might want to try doing an online search.  I'm sure there are plenty of resources.<br>  And always, always prioritize from hardest to easiest.<br>  Hope I could help.

This will happen because recycling plastic saves twice as much energy as burning it in an incinerator does. It takes 70% less energy to recycle plastics than it does to make it from raw materials.

e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	There's a lot of different reasons why a teacher might like you - you might remind her of a relative, or a past student, or something.  As long as it doesn't, you know, get sexual, you shouldn't worry.|`|IWSc7xkiaa	I think if you feel comfortable talking to her, then talk to her. If you don't, then don't. It could be that you are making a little more out of this than there really is. If you are a little standoffish, it could be that she is trying to break that and set up a sort of bond that she has with the other students. Maybe she wants to make you feel more comfortable so you will speak up in class or feel welcome to come to her if you ever need to talk. I've actually tried to chit-chat with some of my quieter students in hopes of breaking down a wall that they might feel is there. I want them to feel free to ask for help and approach me about things. Sometimes nothing comes out of it, but an awkward smile from the student like "You are a TEACHER...get away!" After that, I leave them alone and let them fend for themselves.|`|JeMqAdphaa	I think she is trying to be friendly. Maybe she see's you have potential? I'm not quite sure.

n7bok7NRaa	A preface: I know what the answer is, but I bet you do too.<br>  <br>  When you're doing multiple choice questions, there's a lot of things you can do to make sure that you're choosing the right answer (especially when it's right in front of you!).<br>  <br>  1. Go back through the question with your pencil and underline verbs and nouns, positives and negatives. In this case, underline DECLINE, RESPONDING, STIMULATION and CALLED.<br>  <br>  2. Look for wrong answers. Cross them off.<br>  <br>  3. Look for answers that are grammatically incorrect. In this case, Sensing and Experiencing are verbs, not nouns, and the question is asking for a NAME (which is always going to be a noun!)<br>  <br>  4. Can you make a picture with the information given? Say you have a worm, and you stimulate it with an electric zap, eventually (according to this question) it will stop responding to the zap, or react less to it. It's become used to it. Is there a word for that in your answers?<br>  <br>  5. Think about the definitions of the answers you've got, or if you don't know the word right off, try and break down the meaning. Transduction sounds like something travelling or being conducted somewhere. Adaption is like something changing.<br>  <br>  6. Go with your gut. Often times over thinking an answer will make you choose against the right answer because "it's too simple" or that "my first guess can't be right!". Take it from someone who has done hundreds of this sort of test, your gut is almost ALWAYS right.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully I've helped you figure it out.
dca2c702f1f138a553055a97f5b22bd4aa	James Otis delivers a rousing speech, declaring that they are fighting the British so that “a man can stand up,” meaning that they are fighting for the rights of all individuals, everywhere. Forbes wrote Johnny Tremain during World War II, just after Pearl Harbor was attacked. She noticed how young men are forced to grow up quickly in times of war, as they are suddenly responsible for the fate of their country and their fellow men, not just for their own goals and ambitions. Forbes fashioned the youths of her Revolutionary War novel on her observations of the young soldiers fighting in World War II. Johnny Tremain, like the young men in World War II, could not control the circumstances in which fate placed him. Instead, he was forced to find his inner courage and become a self-assured adult.

jOM4bBMPaa	Include an explanation in your essay or your application about your illness causing your high number of absences, and what you are doing/have done to control it now so you'll be able to cut down on those absences in college and be successful.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	Colleges are not going to look at your attendance record unless maybe you are applying to West Point or one of the other Service Academies. Or unless you were to address the issue of absences due to illness as an explanation for less than stellar  grades. In most classes at most colleges no one takes attendance. Of course the service academies would be an exception. For admissions purposes colleges  are concerned with the  gpa calculated on grades earned in academic courses taken during 10th and 11th grade. SAT 1, and if required SAT 2 Subject,  scores. Letters of Recommendation if required. Extracurricular activities and Community Service activities.|`|SXZfntmUaa	yes.my attendance was bad in school life apart from secondary school, but thankfully i got in college. you should tell your college about it.  if its an serious illness then im sure the college would be okay with it and they can authorize it. attendance is very important but it sounds reasonable of what you have.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Admissions committees will certainly notice your attendance record, but if it is less-than-stellar due to a medical issue they will take that into consideration, particularly if you are taking reasonable steps to handle it.

j1fABNBmaa	It depends on your child and what their style of learning is.  There is a TON of material out there!!!  I would recommend asking other homeschoolers for their advice and another good thing for you to do would be to go to a curriculum fair so that you can look over the material in person.  If you happen to have a homeschool group in your area, I'm sure they can help you out.<br>  I will go ahead and recommend a couple things.<br>  For math-Teaching Textbooks.  This is the best math I have used and I know of many other people that use it and love it.  When you buy it you recieve a normal textbook with the lesson in writing, examples and problem sets but you also get all the lectures on a disc.  Usually the lectures on the disc give a bit more detail than the book and are very helpful.  You also receive a book with all the solutions and a CD that works through every single problem step by step to help you or your child find out what you did wrong in the problem and how to fix it.  There is also a test book and another CD with step-by-step solutions to the tests.<br>  Here is the link to their website-<a href="http://www.teachingtextbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.teachingtextbooks.com/</a><br>  <br>  For science- Apologia Educational Ministries science written by  Dr. Jay L. Wile are excellent.  It goes all the way from General Science(which is 7th grade) to Physics and advanced Biology.  These books are wonderful!  They are thorough yet are interesting and not absolute drudgery to read like many science books.  They teach it in a way that makes it stick in your head much better than the books that just throw facts at you and say "memorize this"(not to say that there isn't memorization required in the Apologia course).  <br>  <br>  Here is the link-<a href="https://apologia.securesites.net/store/?PHPSESSID=34bb6a0d118767c358007d3f27ec6797" rel="nofollow">https://apologia.securesites.net/store/?...</a><br>  <br>  I would recommend looking at these websites first to learn about the courses and then you can start searching the web for better prices.  I'm sure you can find these books used, and therefore, much cheaper.<br>  I really hope this helps you!|`|AA11674101	I homeschooled my son. I found complete books on every grade at Barnes & Nobles.

hktbfRPWaa	I know how you feel. It's not the most exciting course (I did it myself - well the whole first year). If it is your second year stick with it - its not worth dropping out now and wasting all that time. Just go and get it finished.<br>  <br>  If it is the first year then it's a little harder. If you are 100% sure it's not what you want to do then consider dropping it. If you can get on a course you want then do, otherwise it means getting a job. I wouldn't consider sticking with it for a year and dropping it as during this time you could get a job and be earning money instead.<br>  <br>  You do have the problem of getting a job, but it is possible. I don't know your age, but that might make a difference - future options and all. Overall only you can decide though.<br>  <br>  Having been in a very similar situation I will say make the decision as soon as possible - don't miss loads of college and then decide you want to continue or waste time doing nothing. But do think carefully about it all and continue lessons while you are deciding just in case you continue. You never know, you may find it gets more interesting. Problem is it is a two year course - do remember that if you leave it any point before hand you will leave with nothing.<br>  <br>  Good luck with making the decision - I hope it works out well for you whatever you choose|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	If you can get a job until next year then drop out and take a new course next year, or persue the career u want to do, though I would get a college qualification if at all possible.

Plants and animals that exist naturally from thousands of years of natural selection are optimized by the process.

xi7mq1xGaa	I'm presuming you're talking about the Nursery class of a state school rather than a private nursery? It depends on the area, and the school. Some areas take children for the full Nursery year before they begin Reception. So for your son that will be September 2010 (he will have a whole year in Nursery before going to Reception aged almost 5 in September 2011). Other areas take children the term or half term after their third brithday. So as your son's 3rd birthday is this coming November he would start in January 2010, which is the start of the next term after his birthday. Then he would have a year and 2 terms in Nursery before going to Reception in Sept 2011. The odd place accepts them literally the day after their third birthday, in which case he would start this coming November. Whichever system your local school/Education Authority operates he definitely won't be able to start until he is 3; so no earlier than 17th November 2009, and it's likely to not be until at least January 2010.|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	Right now you can send him to a playschool where he meets kids of his age but where there is no pressure on the kid and by next year to nursery.|`|cMsC5a14aa	When hes walking and talking and not crapping in his pants usually 4 years old|`|Zhdw6gqvaa	My grand daughter joined Nursery when she was three and half years old.|`|YBVQDwSEaa	any age between 1 and the half to 3 as long he can talk..walk or can get along wit people|`|3c8GsRvUaa	head start is 3,4 and 5 yrs old|`|CNSGz12zaa	I started my son when he was 4, perhaps his birth date is past the cut-off date.

mYhuGonfaa	If you aren't particularly fluent in English, you might have more luck through computer and television so she can learn the correct dialect and pronunciation. I believe Rosetta Stone makes programs for kids, and if you can't afford an actual program, you could simply immerse her in the language, through tv programs and computer games from the US (playhousedisney.com, starfall.com, nickjr.com, etc.) It won't be an easy task, but the more exposed she is, the easier it will be for her to learn!|`|AA10447831	Speak only English to her. Four year olds learn fast!! Put signs on objects in English. Most four year olds can't read yet but you can read them to her. Read her English books that may interest her, take her to English events, parks, playgrounds, movies, library reading sessions, restaurants, etc. Find her an English speaking friend or pre-school class. Make it so she wants to learn to speak English  and, most importantly, encourage English be spoken at home!!|`|YX93lq4daa	If the parents of the child have the money to invest in a program  try muzzy.
IybV1Enwaa	I agree to the other answer. A one year old can recognize letters and a 1.5 year can tell the letter sounds easily. It is mostly the matter of repetition. If children are given enough opportunities to these things they pick up  very fast. Just try to introduce these things in fun way. If you want you can teach the sounds in several sessions (3-4) in one day for max 10 minutes each time. Just put the books at easy access place, like Family room,kitchen island etc. There is a cassette 'Letter Factory by Leap Frog' . I have seen kids LOVE it. I am not a big fan of TV or so but this cassette has something amazing. <br>  <br>  Even if we don't do anything, they will probably learn everything by age. It can be anywhere between 3-5. So overall it is the play which matters most. You can introduce letters and phonics via Play at an early age if you choose to. <br>  <br>  My 2 year old knows all letter sounds and can read some words. I did not force her much, but I do accept that I love working with her on these things. I just can not play running and hide and seek much (lack of stamina) so left with book reading etc..|`|mYhuGonfaa	You can start a child learning letters and sounds when they are babies. Letters are nothing more than a physical representation of a part of a word. When a baby is learning to talk, she can point to a dog and say "dog", so she can also point to a block with the letter 'A' and say 'A'. But don't force it, focus more on speech development, social skills, and normal toddler growth, like fine motor and large motor skills, talking, listening, following directions, etc. If they are read to daily, talked to, and played with, they will be just fine by the time they enter school, no workbooks, lessons, etc. necessary!|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	i dno
34VXCyvVaa	I can't answer your question, but I'd suggest that you ask a lot of questions about both schools. How long have they been in business? What percentage of entering students graduate? For the ones who don't graduate, why do they leave school? (If they are getting jobs in the industry, fine. If not, are they leaving because they've flunked out, can't afford to attend any longer, are transferring to other schools, or some other reason?) How many graduates have they produced? What percentage of those graduates are currently working in the field of music production? What kinds of jobs do they hold? How long does it take the average grad to find a job? What percentage of them are employed at graduation? What kind of salaries are they making? What kind of internships are available through the school? (This is important because it provides work experience and contacts in the business.) What percentage of students do internships? (If there are a limited number of internships, then you may not be getting the experience or contacts you'll need.) Do any record companies/production companies recruit at the school or are students on their own after graduation when it comes to finding a job? Is a four-year degree really necessary to become a record producer? Ask about the curriculum -- what would you be studying? Is the course load entirely oriented toward the music business or would you also be required to take math/English, etc. similar to a regular university? What are the advantages of attending that particular school vs. other school? You need to ask the hard questions of the admissions people rather than just being dazzled by the possibilities. You need to make sure that whatever school you attend will be the right one to move you toward your goal.

AA10478980	It doesn't sound like she is out to get you.  It simply sounds like an assignment got lost somehow.  I would recommend that you and your cousin work separately and not do similar work.  It probably was quite obvious to your teacher that you collaborated on the poem.  Teachers see a lot of that kind of thing - switching lines and rewording is obvious to teachers.  Just do your work independently, and make sure that when you pass in assignments you hand it to the teacher personally, and have a brief conversation with her about it so that she will remember you handed it in.|`|mYhuGonfaa	Okay, the first question I have is, how are you turning these in? You mentioned it was online, so are you emailing them or do you have a program that you submit assignments into? Because if you emailed or submitted it to some kind of online program, there should be proof right there of when you turned it in and what exactly you turned in. You can go to your sent folder and show her exactly when it was sent, or to the assignment online which should have a date stamp. I wonder if you sent a blank email and forgot to attach it or something? If you truly feel that she doesn't like you (although this is only one assignment, you can't really make that assumption yet), then you need to hand things directly to her, or keep record of when things were sent online so you can clearly prove that your things were in on time.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	For the assignment you already completed, stop fighting her and have your cousin attest that y ou did the assignment.  She won't believe it coming from you, since she thinks you didn't turn it in.  For the poem, you and your cousin did the wrong thing.  You were asked to work on it individually, and since you switched lines, she now thinks you both cheat.  You will have to do another poem, and don't talk to your cousin about it at all.<br>  <br>  One thing I would suggest:  You seem to think that when you are given a week to work on an assignment that it is a good thing to turn it in early.  Most teachers hate that, for a couple of reasons.  First of all, it is hard to keep track of papers turned in at many different times, so we would prefer that everyone turn them in together when they are due.  Secondly, if you were given a week to work on it, she wanted you to put some thought and care into it, and if you just dashed something off and turned it in within a day, it is obvious that you did not do what you were expected to do.

The term was coined in 1938[1] by Milton Sirotta (1929–1980), nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner. Kasner popularized the concept in his book Mathematics and the Imagination (1940).<br>  <br>  Googol is of the same order of magnitude as the factorial of 70 (70! being approximately 1.198 googol, or 10 to the power 100.0784), and its only prime factors are 2 and 5 (100 of each). In binary it would take up 333 bits. A googol has no particular significance in mathematics, but is useful when comparing with other incredibly large quantities such as the number of subatomic particles in the visible universe or the number of possible chess games. Edward Kasner created it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity, and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/googol" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/googol</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/googolplex" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/googolplex</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/nikolai-gogol" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/nikolai-gog...</a><br>  <br>  According to the Google.com web site, "google" was chosen as "a play on" the word "googol," picked because it reflects "the company's mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the web." Yeah, right. I'd be willing to bet that either they just didn't know how to spell "googol" when they registered their domain name or, more likely, some mathematician had already snatched up "googol.com."<br>  <br>  As for "googol," back in the 1930s, U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner was trying to think of a name for a very large number, ten raised to the hundredth power, and decided to pose the question to his nine year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta. Little Milton gave the matter some serious thought and after a few minutes came up with "googol," which, once popularized by his Uncle Edward, has ever since signified 1 followed by 100 zeroes. "Googol" is something of a linguistic rarity, having been invented by an identifiable person and not being based on any other word. Evidently Milton just plain dreamed it up out of thin air.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, if contemplating how many things a "googol" might actually represent doesn't give you enough of a headache, you might try considering a later development, the "googolplex," which is ten to the power of a googol. That's a lot more than 99 bottles of beer on the wall. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.word-detective.com/011502.html#googol" rel="nofollow">http://www.word-detective.com/011502.htm...</a><br>  <br>  1940, in "Mathematics and the Imagination," a layman's book on mathematics written by U.S. mathematicians Edward Kasner (1878-1955) and James R. Newman, the word supposedly coined a year or two before by Kasner's 9- (or 8-) year-old nephew (unnamed in the book's account of the event), when asked for a name for an enormous number.

Each family was issued with a book of "points".   Not all food items were rationed, but to obtain the items that were rationed, you had to exchange some of your points plus the cash of course.   There were always some vegetables not on ration, and bread was`nt rationed.   But things like sugar, cheese, butter, meat etc were rationed and very hard to get.   Rationing finished around 1952 as I remember.

I don't know where you live, but if you live in America, you're probably trying to save your money and not waste any cash on odd things that you do not need.  This is rationing your money.

However, are you doing this solely because you want to impress the medical school folks. If so, I might reconsider. But if English truly is your passion it will certainly help you in your pursuit of a medical degree. Also, there are combined MD/JD programs that allow you to obtain your degree to become a doctor and a lawyer simultaneously. This would certainly be a huge endeavor, but if it is something that interests you then go for it!|`|YXScCSBuaa	Law school look for unique individuals with varied human experiences. I don't think you should worry too much about what your major is. In fact, sometimes they look at unconventional majors (Biology, Math) approvingly. It is more important to do well on the LSAT and create a resume that demonstrates a wide variety of service/work/life experiences that make you an interesting candidate that would bring diversity to a school. In other words, major in whatever you want!

23xC6I2Gaa	I would check into your Pharmacy School and see what their requirements are. "Pre-Pharmacy" isn't really a degree... so you may be able to get your degree in Finance and just make sure you take the other pre-requisites in order to get into Pharm. School. Many times, graduate schools don't care what your undergrad major was, they are only concerned with whether or not you have the pre-reqs to get in. My friend got into Med-School and his undergrad was in History.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a need to double major... I would just concern myself with getting the type of education you want.<br>  <br>  Also, I understand that it's important to have job security... but don't force yourself to go to school for a job that your parents want you to have. You should enjoy what you do. Make sure you make the right decisions for you.|`|XmLJ84YBaa	If you don't want to be a pharmacist then why put yourself through all that? Job security in finance will probably be just fine. Yes, the economy is in the dumps right now, but this is exactly why we need people like you to get us back on track. Also, if you plan on going to pharmacy school just to please your parents and then ultimately only look for jobs that use your finance degree that really isn't fair to someone who may not have been accepted into pharmacy school that really wanted to be a pharmacist.|`|cOhx76DFaa	It's a lot of extra work, but it couldn't hurt.  However, you should be aware that Pharm School is really difficult to get into - they expect applicants to have demonstrated interest in the field, and not simply the coursework, so it'll show if you're doing it as an afterthought.|`|7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	With pharmacy, as long as you take all of the pre-reqs, they don't care about your major.

Trying hard in school means you are determined to excel in all areas in school. NOT JOCK not nerd not pretty-young thing types but being able to be a balanced individual able to master all the areas of development in school. Some of the most popular people in school end up zeros in real life because they limit themselves to one type of achievement. Heroes in life are the result of excellent schooling. The basic of all success is goal orientation,time management and discipline where once you have mastered these skills you have truly been successfully educated.
jS10yIEwaa	Medieval age 500 - 1500 or so. The most over written or essayed character is Vlad Tepes ( Vlad the Impaler). However, the most written about means that there is a vast amount of information about him. Be careful that your information is correct and if you show how his history is relevant today or how his reign is told in stories from Germany and Russia as well as in his home country, Romania. Or, if you can show how much of Europe hated him but to the people of Romania and Moldova he was also a great King your essay may stand out and gain marks for originality. Also, he was the basis for every vampire story ever told in  the modern age. So you can show how the stories from that age still remain with us today. Remember that with so many stories about him that you would have to sort the facts from the fiction: but showing that may gain you marks for your efforts. The most important part of a research essay is showing that you really worked at the research part as much as the writing part.<br>  Good luck.

Usually, it's just that something has changed, and people are very resistant to change. Also, people tend to think that guidance or opinions published by lobby groups or campaigning organisations - like a preference not to use specific language to describe people, such as "Mongol" for people with Down's Syndrome - is somehow now enshrined in law. It usually isn't. It's just a new idea. Some people don't like new ideas either.<br>  <br>  There are of course instances where pointless decisions have been made or needless nannying has taken place, but I find it irritating that the instances of "political correctness" are almost always accepted as lunatic without challenge, while the constant harping of the nasty brigade that "political correctness has gone too far" is usually accepted without any critical thinking whatsoever. <br>  <br>  As soon as that phrase is wheeled out, there's one thing you need to do first: find out the facts.

"Have" means they've got something, presumably a situation. "Everybody" means so many people that it's perceived as everyone. "Kicking" means forcefully moving one's legs in order to wield their feet as weapons. "Hocking", I think, means to pawn one's belongings. "Away" refers to doing something repeatedly and/or with vigor.

If you are serious about switching to ASU then do so. You know ASU has a 94% acceptance rate and if you write a mediocre to excellent essay you'll be accepted easy. I assume you're a Arizona residence since you are thinking of ASU after UofA, that makes things easier because I am sure they prioritize Arizona residence above all.

EvyY3dUNaa	What are your life's goals?,<br>  <br>  If you want to earn lot of Money (I said LOT), then somewhere you cannot stick with this policy<br>  <br>  if your goal in life is to earn to feed yourself and your family and give them optimum resourses they need and otherwise you get satisfaction not from Money but from doing your work with honesty and what you are getting. Then you can be honest<br>  <br>  (Honesty is closely related with the people who are truely religious and who are God Fearing OR people who have firm beleif in their own principles and they never do any bad deeds becuase their inner self doesn't permit this, otherwise in today's senario the world is full of people who can go to any extent for feaching opportunity)<br>  <br>  The Thirst of "WANT MORE" makes a Person Corrupt and Dishonest. <br>  <br>  Honest person can also becomes Dishonest anytime due to number of reasons, out of topic.<br>  <br>  So Honesty is the best Policy if you feel it is, Otherwise it is useless if you don't think good! <br>  <br>  and What are the things that you think under Honest and Dishonest category! is your attitude and beleif.<br>  <br>  Some people think that getting things done with someone's approach is Ok, others feel this is Bad Deed and led to Dishonesty<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a tale of two brothers, who were merchants. It is also a cautionary tale about how business should, and should not be conducted.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The two brothers lived in the ancient city of Surajkund, not far from where New Delhi now stands. They used to venture to the Surajkund Mela (Fair) to sell their dubious goods and wares. The elder brother, being an honest man, soon built up a reputation for straight dealing and fairplay. For these are qualities that are valued even among double dealers and thieves – perhaps more so, since they are in such short supply amoung them.<br>  <br>  The younger brother did not do so well, for he was secretive and deceitful in his ways.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  It is sad, but true, that the success of one is the cause of envy for another. Soon, the time came for a parting of ways among them. <br>  <br>  The elder brother decided to go among the poor to sell his wares, for they were simple folk like himself. Even though he had to toil hard to earn the confidence of his clientele, and the profits were meagre (for the poor do not have wealth to spare), the elder brother was sucessful in building up the trust that is essential for doing business. The younger brother, perhaps driven by the lure of quick money, planned to offload his dubious goods wherever he could. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Many days passed…<br>  <br>  When he had not heard from his brother, the elder brother made discreet enquiries among his former acquaintances and friends. He was to hear a sorry tale. His brother, confident of success with his schemes, had been caught trying to sell stolen merchandise to some nobleman. And now languished in prison, in some forgotten cell, with others of his own kind.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  What is the moral of the story?<br>  <br>  It tells us that honesty is the best policy, even when we are dealing with people who may be less honest than ourselves.|`|2BpkXSnqaa	"honesty is the best policy" means that telling the truth should be the first response to answering any question or dilemma. If one lies, then one will wind up having to make up another lie at some point to cover the first one and on and on. Being honest is always the best choice!<br>  <br>  Proverbial Meaning: Being honest is the best way to be in life, or when you’ve done something wrong.<br>  <br>  Literal Origins: When doing business with people being honest is the best policy because without their trust your business will fail.<br>  <br>  Common Usage: This is an extremely popular proverb, often quoted to someone when they’ve asked for advice on a situation where they did something wrong, or cheated on a love partner. The truth will come out in the end is the underlying sentiment.|`|pSW4LMxlaa	it means that be honest always and you will be OK.

AA10447831	Personally I would switch teachers cause your kid has lost interest. Or try a different instrument or activity. Kids need to change their activities throughout growing up so they can see what really turns them on.|`|e9v0jjHJaa	You should probably consider a different teacher. That's in no way an affront to your current teacher... she's obviously experienced and qualified. (She's also very expensive, as most piano teachers charge $12 to $20 for a half-hour lesson.)<br>  <br>  Clearly, all the ingredients are seemingly there: Your daughter is capable of learning, she's capable of practicing, and your teacher is capable of doing a good job. So it really comes down to your daughter's motivation.<br>  <br>  For kids of this age, it's all about the connection. If they have a teacher they like--whether it's for extra-curriculars or school--they respond very well and make a concerted effort to try hard. Your current piano teacher may certainly be the best in the area, but your daughter doesn't need this level of expertise yet. It just seems to me there's no real connection there.<br>  <br>  I had a similar experience with my daughter. When she started taking lessons from a much younger teacher--a grad student in piano performance, as opposed to someone with years and years of experience--she had a much better connection and had a lot more fun. As a result, she practiced more, enjoyed the material more, and really wanted to do well.<br>  <br>  If that's an option for you, try it. Believe me, if your daughter isn't motivated and doesn't enjoy it, her teacher won't either. And she certainly won't be offended if you tell her your plan. In fact, she may welcome it!
stMcVPCMaa	Good job!  You missed a few commas, but otherwise your punctuation is great.  Watch out for "filler" words - words that are repetitive - they say the same thing you already said in another word, or words that don't add any content to the sentence.  For example, in the phrase, "She is my inspiration because she has taught me " - the word, "has" should be avoided here; it's past tense used with two present tense verbs and doesn't add anything to the sentence.  Personally I dislike the use of any form of the verb, "to have" because it so often adds no value.  My writing professor told me that you should never use that verb, although to this day I still use it occasionally - I can't figure out how he accomplishes avoiding it completely!<br>  <br>  You should rewrite "Describing the importance of composition and lighting allowed me to reach new heights as I then incorporated what she had taught into my own pieces." because you just explained how she told you these things, but the first part of this sentence indicates that you were the one describing, rather than your cousin.  I also think you should rewrite the two phrases, "she/he sat me down…” I can’t explain why I don’t like those phrases but they feel very awkward to me.  You can probably easily remove them from the sentences altogether by rewriting a few of the words remaining.<br>  <br>  My suggestions for punctuation and avoiding filler words are below.  Also note, I rearranged the sentence, "As a second job he also photographed weddings each weekend as a way to explore his creativity." because you broke up his reasons for being a wedding photographer and used "as" twice in the same sentence.  Take another look at that sentence; there might be an even better way to write it than I did.<br>  <br>  (By the way – “writer’s block” is when you can’t think of what to write about... not when you don’t know how to write it correctly ? )<br>  <br>  After completing my research I have found that the people who inspired me the most were the people closest to my life. My cousin Raissa Venables, a published photographer/ artist, dedicated her life to the teaching of her experiences and knowledge of photography at the School of Visual Arts. Her experiences have enabled her to travel to Germany and eventually open a gallery there. She is my inspiration because she taught me that even though photography might be a difficult field; those who work hard and have an education are the people that achieve the most. After her publication was released I sat down with her and she described each piece and how it was created. Describing the importance of composition and lighting allowed me to reach new heights as I then incorporated what she taught me into my own pieces. Through her encouragement I felt confident in my quest to major in photography as she taught me to always do what I love. Along with my cousin, my uncle Gary Messenetti has welcomed me into his home to teach me the means in which it takes to become a professional photographer. At an early age my Uncle Gary knew that he had a passion for photography and decided to dedicate his life to being an undercover private eye in the police force. As a second job and as a way to explore his creativity, he also photographed weddings each weekend. One afternoon he sat me down and told me that success is a state of mind. So is failure, which can be seen as success when you look at it the way Babe Ruth or Thomas Edison looked at it. You can become depressed because of your failures or they can energize you and allow you to look at your experiences not as failures but as attempts that are paving the road to success. As an artist you will rarely succeed on your first try. This is especially true if you are trying new ways to represent the world and to express your vision. A certain amount of trial and error is necessary, and a certain amount of failure is to be expected. If you let your failures discourage you, you will not maintain your creativity; instead you will be creative for some time, and then fall into depression when you fail to be successful at your first attempts. I have found within my own experiences that a failure is certainly a setback and it can show the limits of your knowledge. You failed not because of your lack of talent, or are incapable of success but the lack of knowledge in how to succeed. The process of acquiring this knowledge is what will enable us to expand our current boundaries, and it is knowledge is what will make us go beyond our actual limitations.

jxPr6dd4aa	weekends are too short
XmLJ84YBaa	Why not check for a tutor at your school? At my college there were designated tutors for the very difficult courses (math, science, etc.) but if you needed help in something else they would find a tutor for you. Also, if you found the exact answers you were looking for right out of your textbook chances are good that those answers are right.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	You have set yourself up for failure by putting yourself in a situation in which you have high bills and have to work too much to pay them.  No wonder you aren't enjoying school if you are lacking time either to study or to have fun.  If you are a full-time student, and this is your first semester, you shouldn't be working more than about 10 hours/week at most.  If you really can't do anything but work full-time, you shouldn't be taking more than one or two classes at a time.<br>  <br>  Frankly, the classes you take at college for your first two years are very general anyway, at most places, so choosing your passion isn't urgent at this point.<br>  <br>  As to other things, you could, of course go into the military, if you choose to do so and qualify to do so.  You do need to be fully aware that it isn't just an adventure, it is the military, which means you are taking major life risks, and committing yourself to something you can't just quit if you don't like it.  The Peace Corps doesn't normally take people before they graduate from college.  <br>  <br>  You could, of course, train for a trade.  Instead of going to a university, you could do a shorter course to learn to be something like an auto or aircraft mechanic, or you could do an apprenticeship to someone like an electrician or a plumber.  <br>  <br>  My concern about you would be your expectations.  I'm not sure what you were looking for in college, but you won't get passion and excitement if you try to take a full load while working full-time.  The same would be true of every other option out there.  Putting aside a couple of hours/week for something and then finding yourself stressed isn't going to get any better if you do that with anything other than school.|`|UxooffHZaa	It's better to go to college without a major, and get your BA in General Studies (called Liberal Arts at some schools). This "undecided" major, while not leading directly to any job, will give you options for the future. During it, you will study a wide array of subjects, and may find your calling. (I believe everyone has something they're meant to do, the question is just finding it) <br>  If you have your BA, there are a lot more options open to you. i.e. Let's say you're 30 and you decide you want to work in Commercials, if you don't have your degree, you can study for 4 years to earn a degree, then try to get the job, at 34, without experience. (BA classes are most often during the day, while graduate classes are most often in the evenings) If you have a BA in General Studies, you can enter a 2 year evening Master's program, during the first semester do an internship during the days, while you take classes at night, maybe have a ground level marketing job by your 2nd year of studies, and be working with your MBA by the time you're 32.|`|34VXCyvVaa	It does seem like you're kind of drifting aimlessly through life.  Perhaps you're one of those people who will never really get "into" a career, but will find some kind of job to support themselves and develop interesting hobbies and interests on the side.  If you weren't in school, what would you be doing with your free time?  Playing video games?  Watching TV?  Hanging out with your girlfriend?  Those aren't very productive activities unless the relationship has some long-term potential.  What would you like to learn in your life?  Karate?  How to take better digital pictures?  How to repair your car or computer?  How to do carpentry?  How to give a speech?  What would you like to experience?  Wind-surfing?  Travel to the Orient?  Rock-climbing?  Major rock concerts?  Dining in New Orleans?  Riding a camel?  Civil war reenactment?  Maybe you need to make a life list of things to accomplish and then start working your way down the list.  Some of your items can be accomplished locally and/or inexpensively, while others may require planning, training or preparation of some kind, but each one would be a learning experience that may revive your interest in education in general.  Along the way, you may find an interest that gives you direction in your life.|`|9rZINwbpaa	Just do it like you did for your hs diploma. youre going to regret it someday if you dropout.|`|YjvnxGGwaa	Almost every college, even junior colleges have a vocational counselor who can do an interview and give one or more of several aptitude/ interest tests. Get as much information as you can.  For a young man a tour in  the military (especially if you have a year or two of college) can get you valuable "hands on" training in the field of your choice.  Also a chance to travel (not always to combat areas).  I served two years back in the dark ages (56-58) and it was the most valuable learning experience of my life.  You can obtain valuable scholarship money for going back to college or some vocational school. With all due respect it seems as if you really do not want to do anything.  That is probably the reason everyone was so interested in seeing you in college.  They realize you are "aimlessly" drifting and could wind up in a "dead end" job.  Your dad has been very good to you.  I could say some very harsh things but I am sure you have heard them before.<br>  From the quality of your letter it is easy to see that you have taken advantage of your high school education.  Many college graduates can not write as well. (sort of late but you should have tried for advance placement in some subjects)<br>  Good luck.

In today's usage (according to a couple different dictionaries) they can both be used to refer to an infant or a young woman or sweetheart. The differences are that "babe" is also used to refer to a naive or inexperienced person and that "baby" also refers to someone who is like a baby in behavior or to something that is one's special responsibility, achievement, or interest.

You could also look into getting a tutor for that class.<br>  <br>  As for your financial aid, contact your financial aid office.  Find out what the criteria is to keep your aid.  Even if you fall out of compliance there may be a chance for you to appeal.  Schools have what is called a Satisfactory Academic Progress policy (or something simularly named) that outlines the criteria for keeping your aid.  If you fall out of compliance, it should outline your options (like having the chance to appeal).  Don't be afraid to talk to them and ask questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

For example, if they estimate ahead of time that at least 25 people will order fresh fish on a given night, but only 10 people order it, what do they do with the rest of the fish?  Likewise, if they order or make enough fresh rolls in anticipation of, say, 50 diners, but it turns out that it's an unexpectedly light night, with only a couple of tables filled, what do they do with the extra rolls?<br>  <br>  (3) Depending upon how many years he's been a restaurant manager, ask him how dining trends have changed over time, say in the past 20 years or so.<br>   <br>  (4) Ask if young children are often in his restaurant, and if so, how would he rate their behavior?  What does he do about complaints from neighboring tables, when children are disruptive?<br>  <br>  (5) What differences has he noticed in his business in the past 6 months during the steep economic downturn?  Do they have fewer customers on average?  Has he noticed any changes in the types of foods people order?  <br>  <br>  (6) With food prices rising, what changes have they been forced to make to their menu so as to make ends meet or increase profits?  <br>  <br>  (7) What was the most difficult/rudest/most outrageous diner/customer he ever encountered?  How did he handle the problem?<br>  <br>  (8) Do they honor special requests of their diners?  What was the most unusual request he ever had?  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your interview.

PrFn1Wi0aa	If this is your child's first experience with paint, then you might want to first introduce tempera paint and have your child work with just one or two colors to get used to using a paint brush, learning how to apply paint on the brush and paper, learning how to rinse a brush and change colors. <br>  <br>  Have your child experiment with different brush strokes and experiment with stamps, sponges, and even fruit. <a href="http://www.teaching-tiny-tots.com/toddler-activities-apple-printing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.teaching-tiny-tots.com/toddle...</a> and <a href="http://www.teaching-tiny-tots.com/toddler-activities-sponge-painting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.teaching-tiny-tots.com/toddle...</a> are two ideas.<br>  <br>  To teach about colors, you can use two primary colors and explore secondary colors.  Ex. red + yellow = orange. Or seeing what happens when you add white or black to a color. <br>  <br>  Later on you might try other types of paint like water colors and acrylics.  I found that watercolor in tubes are nice for young children to work with.  They can focus on just how ever many colors you give them instead of a tray of color which can look like one color at the end of the activity if they are not familiar with using watercolors. <br>  <br>  Have Fun!|`|3c8GsRvUaa	show them<br>  use 3 colors at a time|`|AA10407542	PCY,<br>  <br>  I think when you mention “teach” you are talking about introducing them to painting?  Since this forum is for preschool and a lot of the answerers are trained in this area, I will offer you some aspects of early childhood education within this.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you take the emphasis off of the product and focus more on the process.  There is something called “modeling” in art with children.  In other words, you are showing them a finished product (or describing it) and whether you want it to happen or not, they will try to reproduce it.  Im sure you have had this happen to you in some of your early experiences.  When art is reduced to modeling, it thwarts individual interpretation, sets mostly unattainable goals, and leads to frustration and avoidance of “art” activities.  So, from an early childhood view, to “teach” painting would be to “offer” painting.  Art at this age should be more of the self-help variety, where you have the materials in front of them and they create in a way that represents their visions.  Staying within the lines, coloring items the “correct” color, or any type of model to go by would not represent what painting, or art should be for a 4 year old.  Trust me, for the rest of this child’s life he will be told what to do, and how to do it plenty!  Think of what this child will gain in competency will be in a place where they can investigate, explore, manipulate, and create in a way that is purely personal.  So much emphasis is put on school readiness these days and it is of concern to me indeed.  I would put as much time and energy I could into having chances for this child to take some risks in a safe environment with YOU!  <br>  <br>  Think about materials for a four year old.  The brushes need to be small enough for him to manipulate but this could also be done with his hands too!  Having different textured items for experimentation will add to fine motor, sensory, cognitive, and creative selves.  Don’t over think this and allow this child to explore, create, and represent them self in a way that is unique and personal.|`|2mTC4wVkaa	Painting at this age should be very "process" oriented rather than "product" oriented.  I teach preschool,  and this age loves to paint with a variety of materials, including feather dusters, body puffs( the kind you would use for showering with), spray bottles and a variety of  foods. You can use apples (cut in half and show the kids the "star"), lemons, green peppers (both cut in half), then they dip those items into the paint.  They also love to paint with rollerballs and brushes of various sizes.  Be sure to try fingerpainting. That is a definite favorite!!!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!
AA10023710	That's fabulous! Most internships are unpaid, so the fact that they are paying you at all, and paying for your travel, is wonderful. <br>  <br>  Is it enough? It'll be tight. What are your options regarding housing? Will the university give you free housing, or can they help you find a flat/apartment share? I know that McGill does rent out its residence halls during the summer, so that's absolutely an option for you. You can ask them about that, and about how much it costs. Their residence halls aren't bad at all. The rooms are small, but they are singles - you do not have a roommate. They provide the basics - furniture and etc. The halls are in a nice area of Montreal, in walking distance (although up hill from) the main campus and from downtown Montreal, so you won't need to pay for transport, and that will help. The halls have one small kitchen on each floor, as I remember it, so you can do some basic cooking, and I believe they serve meals downstairs for a small fee. <br>  <br>  Speak to McGill about housing. Once you figure out your housing costs, you'll know better about whether or not $360 per week is enough. <br>  <br>  But I bet you can scrimp, share a flat or live in the dorms, and make that amount work. You should absolutely try to do so. This is a huge opportunity, and it's a prestigious thing, to get an internship, as an Indian, in Canada. McGill U is also one of the strongest universities in the world. Well done!|`|p0guNQhiaa	Considering that it's an internship, they're not required to pay you anything. So I would take what they offer and you appreciate it. The real value of an internship comes from the work experience.

tRcO5uyiaa	Internet capitalization conventions are the practices of various publishers regarding the capitalization of the term "Internet" or "internet".<br>  <br>  In formal usage, the word Internet is traditionally treated as a proper noun and written with a capital first letter. Since the widespread deployment of the Internet Protocol Suite in the early 1980s, the Internet standards-setting bodies and other related organizations, such as the Internet Society, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the World Wide Web Consortium, use this convention in their publications. In English grammar, proper nouns are capitalized. However, critics argue that some things that are unique yet distributed, such as "the power grid", "the telephone network", and even "the sky", are not considered proper nouns, and are thus not capitalized.

AA10023710	It depends. I'd want you to apply to at least one reach school, where your scores and GPA and etc. are a bit low for them, but you love the school. A few fit schools, where your scores and GPA are right in their averages. And one or two backups, where your scores and GPA are high for them. <br>  <br>  There is no set "good amount of colleges to apply to". It depends on your comfort level, and also on your need for financial aid. The only thing I can say is that you absolutely want to apply to more than one school. Even if you really, really only want to go to NC State, and know you'll probably get in there, you need a backup. In addition, if you need financial aid, you'll want to apply to more than one school so you can compare aid packages. <br>  <br>  So at minimum, apply to two schools. But you could think about applying to 1-2 reaches, 2-4 fits, 1-2 or so backups. Add more fits and backups, if you'd like, and maybe one more reach - it's up to you. <br>  <br>  I've seen students apply to only one or two colleges, and others apply to 10+. I think, on average, if I remember the stats, most students applied to about 6-10 colleges last year.|`|Moz2d806aa	Usually, should apply for about 4. 2 that you really want, and 2 backup schools in case you don't get in.

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	What you have to start with is getting to the bottom of WHY he is spitting.  Is it a condition where he feels it's the only way to communicate?  If so, there should be things in place to help him communicate different things.  <br>  <br>  Is it a discipline issue?  Well...it might be.  It's really hard to say.  If it is, it needs to be corrected and the right way to handle things should be taught.<br>  <br>  With your son having autism and being so non verbal, my GUESS is that this is from a lack of being able to communicate.  What needs to happen is notes need to be taken on when he is doing these things and what the situation was before and during the events.  Was there anything that made him stop?<br>  <br>  Some techniques for helping him communicate the need he has can then be put in place.  Pictures are often a good thing to use instead of words.  If he's hungry and he can't say anything, he can pull out a picture of food.  If he's tired and can't say anything...a picture of a bed or a person sleeping.  <br>  <br>  I agree with you on some points...the teachers should be more understanding.  But teacher's aren't necessarily trained to handle special circumstances such as autism.  If they're getting too frustrated and you feel like they're giving up, it is time to discuss with them your options and see if the classroom is really a good fit for him.<br>  <br>  As far as KP's response goes, go easy on him.  It must be sad to have no friends and have your only source of happiness be to make fun of others on yahoo answers.|`|AA10921553	I am a parent of six children. Two are special needs, one being Asperger's syndrome( a form of autism). I would suggest that you do research on the spitting issue and call a case conference to address the issue. OT and ST are NOT going to address the spitting. Does he have a BIP to re-enforce his good behaviors? If not, I would get a Behavior Intervention Plan in place with specific steps and goals for him. They can give him a reward chart for the behaviors they want him to do and give the rewards, when he does good, at set intervals. The BIP will also outline what exactly the school is supposed to do when he does it. Things such as redirection or time-outs will be in there. If it doesn't state in his IEP that he is to get sent home for bad behaviors, then the school cannot do that. It ends his day before a normal child's and that is against the law. If he's in special ed, then it's something the teacher and teacher's aide are going to have to deal with. It's their job. The picture idea mentioned above is a great idea. Austi's love pictures. I would also ask if you could go observe him while he's in the classroom. Stay outside and watch what he does so you can see if something is triggering him. If there is a trigger, then it's up to the teacher to see it's stopped. Hope this helps.|`|SCiY5JESaa	Try this: Since he is doing this when "YOU " are not around, have him take a framed picture of you and place it on his desk at school and remind him that You will be watching him at school to make sure he stops this behavior,or even set up a fake camcorder at school but tell him you'll be watching and when or if he does it again have the teacher call you without telling him she is calling you so you can say you saw him and that should help curb the situation|`|ajPRVnFVaa	The school Psychologist should complete a "Functional Behavior Assessment" to determine what the antecedents are when he spits. He should not be punished for this as this is a symptom of his disability and the federal statute "IDEA" prohibits the school from punishing him.  I would call a meeting with the principal and director of special services to address this issue.  I would also educate myself in the regulations so that the school no longer violates your sons rights to a free and appropriate public education. (FAPE)|`|IvPhch7Faa	I agree that you should go observe your son's class. you need to work with the school, his teachers and therapists.  ask the teacher nicely why she feels spitting is such a big deal.  then try to help her stop him from spitting at school.  she will appreciate your support!|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	Maybe you need to try a different school.

Plus if he is spitting in peoples faces that is just so disgusting, how do you deal with something like that? They can not tape his mouth shut or really punish him because he would just probably get either, angry, scared, or confused.

I agree that it is wrong to send him home for that,  they should try to work the problem out so he can get past his frustrations and make progress.  You are definitely in the right, feeling this way.  I would talk to the principal, ask for more progress reports, maybe have a conference with the teachers and tell them that he must be feeling frustrated because he never does it at home etc.   I wish you the best of luck.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	time to go ask for an indepth report...they aren't giving you much info and certainly arent doing their job. how many children are in his class? how many teachers and assistants? dont wat for the reports to come to you,rather go ask for them,visit his class and speak to other parents about how they feel the school and staff are responding to them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec04/autism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec04/autism....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autismeducation.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autismeducation.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://autism.about.com/od/schoolandsummer/a/edoptionshub.htm" rel="nofollow">http://autism.about.com/od/schoolandsumm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309072697." rel="nofollow">http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=030...</a><br>  <br>  this are some of the links I found rearding autism and education,will take some reading but it should help. make sure the staff gives you written reports of your childs advances and stuff like that. a meeting with both the occupational therapist and speech therapist is needed,asap.just show up in school and ask until you get some answers that make sense to you. yeah I know ,some might say make an appointment etc, come back later when there's time, but if you plant yourself in there until you get some straight answers you'll be more at peace.<br>  <br>  if you dont speak up for your child,who will?<br>  <br>  *as for the spitting,I agree a small pic inhis pocket will do,but also ask your'self why is he doing this while in school? could he be anxious or nervous. chancesare the school and class are not prepared to deal with an autistic child. they require a lot of communicatin from both sides and patience lots of patience.
