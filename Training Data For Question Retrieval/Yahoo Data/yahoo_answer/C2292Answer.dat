f47d7a7cfd58ae992b06f3f80d339c0daa	Well u can try doing research on some of the large hotel chains like Hilton, Ritz, Four Seasons, etc and even chains like Starbucks, McDonald's. Try finding how do they standardise their service and price considering the costs such as real estate prices, salary, cost of procurement of food, beverages, taxes, etc are different and at the same time maintain a standard of service.  At the same time excessive standardisation has its own demerits as service has a lot to do with customs and local tastes and preferences. For example India is probably the only country where McDonald's provides home delivery!  So all in all while it is important to provide quality service everywhere, but what parameters define quality service will differ from location to location depending on local preferences.

ed0eaa15f13e0beea655c337c7d6eb79aa	Plusieurs internautes viennent d ete rpondre en recopiant une partie de l'article de l'encyclopdie Wikipdia, sans citer leur soiurce (c'est pas bien !)    Je te donne le texte en entier :    On nomme incipit le dbut d'un roman (du latin incipio, is, ere... commencer).     l'origine, on dsignait par ce titre la premire phrase d'un roman, aussi nomme phrase-seuil. Il est cependant commun de nos jours de le considrer plut?t comme ayant une longueur variable. Il peut ne durer que quelques phrases, mais aussi plusieurs pages. Contrairement  l'incipit, l'excipit (ou clausule) est la fin d'un chapitre, d'un ouvrage (les derniers paragraphes, les dernires phrases).      **R?le de l'incipit    L'incipit rpond gnralement  trois caractristiques. Il informe, intresse et noue le contrat de lecture.        * Il informe en mettant en place les lieux, les personnages et la temporalit du rcit.        * Il intresse par divers procds techniques, par exemple l'utilisation de figures de style ou encore en une entre in medias res (le rcit dbute dans le feu de l'action).        * Il noue le contrat de lecture en indiquant au lecteur le code quil doit utiliser dans le cadre de sa lecture ; bref, il place diffrents signes annonciateurs du genre littraire auquel il appartient.    ** Incipits clbres    Certains incipits sont insolites (par exemple les droutantes premires pages de Jacques le Fataliste et son ma?tre de Diderot), et dsar?onnent le lecteur en jouant avec les conventions du roman ; d'autres, par leur concision, leur force ou leur humour, ont marqu les esprits et ont su rester dans les mmoires.        * Jacques le Fataliste, (1773), Denis Diderot :        Comment s'taient-ils rencontrs ? Par hasard, comme tout le monde. Comment s'appelaient-ils ? Que vous importe? D'o venaient-ils ? Du lieu le plus prochain. O allaient-ils ? Est-ce que l'on sait o l'on va? Que disaient-ils ? Le ma?tre ne disait rien ; et Jacques disait que son capitaine disait que tout ce qui nous arrive de bien et de mal ici-bas tait crit l-haut.        * Point de lendemain (1777), Vivant Denon        J'aimais perdument la comtesse de *** ; j'avais vingt ans, et j'tais ingnu ; elle me trompa, je me fachai, elle me quitta. J'tais ingnu, je la regrettai ; j'avais vingt ans, elle me pardonna ; et comme j'avais vingt ans, que j'tais ingnu, toujours tromp, mais plus quitt, je me croyais l'amant le mieux aim, partant le plus heureux des hommes.        * Salammb? (1862), Gustave Flaubert :        C'tait  Mgara, faubourg de Carthage, dans les jardins d'Hamilcar.        * Du c?t de chez Swann (1913), Marcel Proust :        Longtemps je me suis couch de bonne heure.        * L'tranger, (1942), Albert Camus        Aujourdhui, Maman est morte.

A m me gustan mucho Alfonsina Storni, Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz y Juana de Ibarbourou, tres maravillosas poetisas. Te comparto dos, uno de Alfonsina y otro de Sor Juana, ambos poemas muy famosos que siempre me gustaron mucho:    TU ME QUIERES BLANCA  (Alfonsina Storni)    T me quieres alba,  Me quieres de espumas,  Me quieres de ncar.  Que sea azucena  Sobre todas, casta.  De perfume tenue.  Corola cerrada    Ni un rayo de luna  Filtrado me haya.  Ni una margarita  Se diga mi hermana.  T me quieres nvea,  T me quieres blanca,  T me quieres alba.    T que hubiste todas  Las copas a mano,  De frutos y mieles  Los labios morados.  T que en el banquete  Cubierto de pmpanos  Dejaste las carnes  Festejando a Baco.  T que en los jardines  ****** del Enga?o  Vestido de rojo  Corriste al Estrago.    T que el esqueleto  Conservas intacto  No s todava  Por cules milagros,  Me pretendes blanca  (Dios te lo perdone),  Me pretendes casta  (Dios te lo perdone),  ?Me pretendes alba!    Huye hacia los bosques,  Vete a la monta?a;  Lmpiate la boca;  Vive en las caba?as;  Toca con las manos  La tierra mojada;  Alimenta el cuerpo  Con raz amarga;  Bebe de las rocas;  Duerme sobre escarcha;  Renueva tejidos  Con salitre y agua;  Habla con los pjaros  Y lvate al alba.  Y cuando las carnes  Te sean tornadas,  Y cuando hayas puesto  En ellas el alma  Que por las alcobas  Se qued enredada,  Entonces, buen hombre,  Pretndeme blanca,  Pretndeme nvea,  Pretndeme casta.  --------------------------------------...

Combats su resistencia  y luego, con gravedad,  decs que fue liviandad  lo que hizo la diligencia.

Muchas veces tenemos la tendencia a huir del amor, debido a que una relacin emocional completa implica muchas cosas, por eso escogemos personas que no son capaces de corresponder a nuestra intencin amorosa, o que las evaluamos inconcientemente como "no interesadas en nosotros".   Es como si ma?osamente una parte de nuestro ser disfrutara el tratar de conseguir el amor de una persona que sabemos de antemano no nos va a correspoder, esto para hacer un juego mental, en el cual, no podemos culparnos a nosotros mismos por no tener pareja, usando el razonamiento: yo hice mi mejor esfuerzo tratando de atraer el amor de X, pero X nunca me presto atencin.

Parece que los ojos se te hubieran volado  Y parece que un beso te cerrara la boca.  Como todas las cosas estn llenas de mi alma,  Emerges de las cosas, llena del alma ma.

Y me oyes desde lejos, y mi voz no te alcanza:  Djame que me calle con el silencio tuyo.    Djame que te hable tambin con tu silencio.  Claro como una lmpara, simple como un anillo.  Eres como la noche, callada y constelada.  Tu silencio es de estrella, tan lejano y sencillo.    Me gustas cuando callas porque ests como ausente,  Distante y dolorosa como si hubieras muerto.  Una palabra entonces, una sonrisa bastan.

So now, the 3 ounce cup contains (3-2) = 1 ounce of water.    5) Full drain out the 5 ounce cup. Transfer the 1 ounce of water from 3 ounce cup into 5 ounce cup. Now, the 5 ounce cup contains exactly 1 ounce of water.    6) Fill up the 3 ounce cup with water and transfer it to 5 ounce cup.    7) Now, 5 ounce cup will have 1 + 3 = 4 ounces of water.

9ef0efb4471c608ec02a8ec3b109f359aa	Hi.    So richtig Sinn macht das wirklich nicht, wenn sie ihre Schulpflicht erfllt hat. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass man ihr erm?glichen wollte, einen Abschluss zu machen und nicht nur mit einem Entlasszeugnis dazustehen.     In Deutschland betr?gt die Schulpflicht insgesamt 12 Jahre (9 Jahre Schule und 3 Jahre Berufsschule). Die muss sie erfllen.     Staatlich nicht anerkannte Schulen, wie du sagst, das sind Schulen, die einen privaten Tr?ger haben, also nicht vom Staat getragen werden. Wenn du da arbeitest, ist dein Arbeitgeber nicht die Regierung sondern z.B. Caritas, Lebenshilfe... Oft ist auch ein Jugendheim dabei.    Die Lehrpl?ne dort sind aber genauso wie bei staatlichen Schulen und die Abschlsse (meist Quali) werden ganz genauso anerkannt, da ist kein Unterschied.    Ausnahme sind  Waldorfschulen u sowas...      so nach deiner mail hab ich mal nachgeschaut, glaub du meinst sog. "ersatzschulen"...kannte ich nicht...schau mal...    http://www.bildungsportal.nrw.de/BP/Schu...    http://www.realschule.bayern.de/bestimmu...    http://www.privatschulen.de/index.php?op...|`|24324bf3c1c7ce2aca0dbd50907c2f34aa	Versteh ich nicht....|`|4ee8124f50c6d4590f2c56014e837a9aaa	Meine Vorantworterin hat da nicht ganz recht:  Ich bin in einer Grndungsinitiative fr eine Sudbury-Schule aktiv (www.sudbury.de) und dort mssen wir uns zwangsl?ufig mit diesem Thema besch?ftigen:  - Eine genehmigte Schule ist eine Schule, an der man die Sculpflicht erfllen kann. Und so eine Genehmigung ist echt schwer zu kriegen, wenn man den Kindern nicht den Rahmenplan aufzwingen will!  - eine staatlich anerkannte Schule, ist eine Schule, die auch Schulabschlsse vergeben kann. Ich wei? nicht genau, wie die Kriterien fr die Anerkennung sind, ich tippe auf jede Menge Fachunterricht und Noten und den ganzen Kram. Vielleicht ist es auch eine Privatschule, die noch in den Kinderschuhen steckt und ihre Anerkennung noch nicht bekommen hat. Es gibt auch Schulen (wir zum Beispiel) die gar keine Anerkennung wollen. Wir glauben, dass es wichtigeres als Abschlsse gibt. Das Lernen sollte im Vordergrund stehen, nicht die Noten oder ein Stck Papier. Wir werden aber natrlich alle unsere Schler, die einen Abschluss machen wollen, dabei untersttzen, dass sie ihren Abschluss extern machen k?nnen. So wie es die Waldorfs machen.|`|dda4e7e79fa1e94393c24e765bba9d52aa	Staatlich anerkannte Schulen halten den Rahmenplan des jeweiligen Bundeslandes ein und sind somit berechtigt Abschlussprfungen durchzufhren und Schulabschlsse zu vergeben.   Staatlich nicht anerkannte Schulen erfllen diesen Rahmenplan nicht, jedoch werden trotzdem wichtige Inhalte vermittelt oder nicht anerkannte, aber doch sehr gute Vermittlungsmethoden gew?hlt. Der Besuch einer nicht anerkannten Schule bringt so zwar nicht direkt einen Abschluss, kann aber zu einer besseren beruflichen Qualifizierung fhren und einem so leichter zu einem Ausbildungsplatz verhelfen. Sollte deine Freundin noch keinen Schulabschluss gehabt haben, als sie von der Schule flog k?nnte auch das ein Grund gewesen sein. Viele nicht anerkannte Schulen arbeiten mit anerkannten Institutionen zusammen, so dass ihre Schler extern regul?re Schulabschlsse erlangen k?nnen, somit konnte deine Freundin an der nicht anerkannten Schule lernen was n?tig war und schlie?lich (mit Abschluss oder auch nicht) gut vorbereitet ins Berufsleben starten.
4ee8124f50c6d4590f2c56014e837a9aaa	Die perfekten Schulen sind fr mich Sudbury-Schulen. Sie orientieren sich am Modell der Sudbury Valley School in den USA.  Grundkonzept: Kinder wollen lernen, vielmehr, sie k?nnen gar nicht anders.   Es gibt in Sudbury-Schulen keine Klassen, alle von 4 - 19 Jahren bewegen sich frei auf dem Schulgel?nde. Jede/r SchlerIn entscheidet selbst was er/sie wann, wie und mit wem lernt. Alle Fragen des Schulalltags werden demokratisch in der Schulversammlung geregelt. Jeder Schler und jeder Mitarbeiter hat eine gleichwertige Stimme, es wird entschieden ber Schulregeln, Anschaffungen und auch die Lehrer (Mitarbeiter) stellen sich j?hrlich zur Neuwahl. Konflikte werden durch das Justizkommittee gel?st, was zu einer ?u?erst angenehmen Schulatmosph?re, praktisch v?llig frei von Gewalt fhrt.  Es gibt weltweit etwa 30 Sudbury-Schulen, in Deutschland gibt es leider noch keine genehmigte Sudbury-Schule, aber in Hamburg sieht es wohl ganz gut aus. Und es gibt zahlreiche Grndungsinitiativen in vielen deutschen St?dten. Ich selbst arbeite auch in einer mit und habe ein Praktikum an einer amerikanischen Sudbury-Schule gemacht.

Darber hinaus wurde durch eine vielseitige P?dagogik der Schler optimal gef?rdert, da nicht jeder Schler mit eingefahrenen p?dagogischen Wegen klar kommt. Nicht jeder Schler kommt mit Montessori oder anderen Programmen klar, deshalb bietet Abwechslung hier eine gewisse Sicherheit, dass der Schler sich wohl fhlt. Darber hinaus w?hlen solche Schulen ihre Lehrer sehr sorgf?ltig aus, die Lehrer sind motiviert und auf einem aktuellen Stand, was wiederum den Schlern zu gute kommt.

befc80c7594cb094c4173640887ea334aa	Hallo,    ja, wie auch schon vorher geschrieben wurde, ist der Abschluss genauso anerkannt - zumindest bei den meisten Anbietern (da sollte man sich natrlich vorher informieren). Es ist auch ein "richtiges" Studium - ich sprech da aus Erfahrung, weil ich grad selber mitten drin stecke (also das ist kein Volkshochschulkurs!).  Angeblich macht sich so ein Studium auch ziemlich gut in deinem Lebenslauf, weil man sehr viel Eigeninitiative und Disziplin aufbringen muss, um sowas neben dem Beruf durchzuziehen. Au?erdem hat man schon Berufserfahrung und kommt nicht nur mit theoretischem Wissen frisch von der Uni an.  Deine Zweifel kann ich allerdings ein bisschen teilen.   Beim berufsbegleitendem Studium (ich kann jetzt nur von mir ausgehen, mit anderen Studieng?ngen kenn ich mich net aus) wird dir das 1. Praxissemester ganz erlassen aufgrund deiner Berufst?tigkeit, und das 2. eigentlich auch - dafr muss man einen Projektbericht schreiben. Is ja auch irgendwie logisch, weil du kannst ja nicht ein halbes Jahr Urlaub machen, um ein Praktikum zu absolvieren.  Das ist natrlich kein Problem, wenn man schon in dem Bereich arbeitet, wo man studiert.  Allerdings kann es auch sein, dass man als z.B. Krankenschwester ein BWL-Studium macht. Und wenn man da dann das Diplom in der Tasche hat, finde ich es doch ziemlich schwierig, wenn man nicht mal ein Praktikum in diesem Bereich gemacht hat! Welche Firma nimmt einen da?  Also in gewissen F?llen sind Zweifel schon angebracht. Aber wenn du das Studium auf dich gut abstimmst, sollte es wohl ein Pluspunkt in deinem Lebenslauf sein.|`|79f93e37e5d27f70afa484d3b148d7a6aa	Hallo,  bei der Auswahl  des Fernstudiums- Anbieters genau hinschauen, ob der Abschluss tats?chlich Annerkannt wird(/ist).

Im engeren Sinne werden darunter die unwillkrlichen Bewegungsvorg?nge verstanden (z. B. Bewegungen des Darms, Peristaltik).    Im weiteren Sinne wird der Begriff aber auch fr Bewegungen der K?rperteile durch die Skelettmuskulatur verwendet.     Mobilit?t = Beweglichkeit ist von "mobil" (lat. mobilis, beweglich) abgeleitet.    Mobilit?t ist ein wichtiges Merkmal menschlicher Kultur. Die Modalit?ten, wie diese Ortsver?nderungen umgesetzt werden, haben sich in den letzten zwei Jahrhunderten stark ver?ndert. Die Mobilit?t ist Ausdruck von Freiheit, die je nach Gesellschaft, Epoche oder Region unterschiedlich ausgepr?gt sein kann. So sind beispielsweise die Einfhrung von Menschen-, und Brgerrechten im 18.-20. Jh., die Abschaffung der Leibeigenschaft im 19. Jh., die Einfhrung des Frauenwahlrechts zu Beginn des 20.

ce680bb0c338e518c60b98d9174e9cfbaa	Kurzfassung:  Vorschule 1 Jahr  Grundschule 6 Jahre  Oberstufe 3 Jahre  Gymn. Schule3 Jahre    Die Gesamtschule. Klasse 1 - 6 ist die Grundschulstufe (Prim?rstufe), 7 - 9 die Oberstufe (Sekundarstufe). Der Abschluss in der 9. Klasse entspricht dem dtsch. Realschulabschluss.  Nach der 9. kann die Aufnahme in  lukio, gymnasiale Stufe oder Secundarstufe II beantragt werden (Notendurchschnitt m?glicherweise Aufnahmeprfung).  Lukio ist auf 3 Jahre ausgelegt und der Unterrichtsstoff wird in sog. Kurse aufgeteilt und getestet. Es gibt allg. bildende und berufsbildende  lukio.    Das finn. Abitur, ylioppilastutkinto, kann nach F?chern auf die Prfungstermine Herbst und Frhjahr aufgeteilt werden. Selbst nach Jahren kann man in einem Fachgebiet zus?tzliche Prfungen ablegen und dadurch neue Bef?higung zum Studium erhalten.    Zuletzt noch finn. Schulen sind Ganztagsschulen, d.h. es gibt was zu essen, Lehrmittelfreiheit bis zur 9. Klasse. An allg. Schulen wird kein Schulgeld bezahlt.    Das finn. Schulsystem wurde am Anfang teilweise vom DDR-Model bertragen, in den 80er Jahren jedoch neu gestaltet.|`|bbbd43737fa6242baf5b333c95baa084aa	Die Finnen (?), jedenfalls ein skandinavisches Land, macht es so, dass alle Schler bis zur 7. Klasse zusammen lernen und dann erst aufgeteilt werden.  Sie duzen die Lehrer....(und haben sogar mehr Respekt als wir).    Die DDR soll auch dieses System bis zur 7.Klasse gehabt haben. Nur das haben wir verteufelt, weil wir es auf die Lerninhalte bezogen haben.

Schlie?lich hatte jedes Kind anspruch auf eine Kindergartenplatz (wie in Schweden), der Klassenverband wurde ziemlich lange nicht auseinander gerissen (in Schweden bis zur 8. und bei uns mindestens auch). Durch den Mauerfall musste dann alles wie in Westdeutschland gemacht werden und heutzutage kommen sie wieder auf die alten Kamellen zurck - nicht so frh selektieren... Ich will damit nicht sagen das die DDR toll war, aber irgendwie jagen sie die gleiche Kuh nochmal durchs Dorf. Kann darber nur den Kopf schtteln wie das mal werden soll, wenn ich vor einer Klasse stehe. Ich hoffe das hilft dir weiter.
d3bbfaaf1a117ee2cc812086332c8a2eaa	Ein wahnsinnig sch?nes Land!  Landschaftlich traumhaft. Du solltest dir dort unbedingt ein Boot, egal welcher Art zulegen um die Ksten und Insellandschaften zu erforschen :)  Die Sprache l?sst sich durchaus erlernen (wenn sogar meine Mama das gelernt hat hehe...). Vieles l?sst sich vom Klang her aus dem Englischen und Deutschen ableiten, au?erdem kann praktisch jeder dort Deutsch und/oder Englisch.  Alkohol ist dort extrem teuer, trotzdem sind viele Norweger sehr(!) trinkfreudig. Besonders in den kleinen abgelegenen (und abgelegen bedeutet in Norwegen wirklich abgelegen) D?rfern. Hier merkt man schon etwas die Folgen einer gewissen Einsamkeit die sich teilweise auf die Gemter schl?gt. Die Winter sind lang, die n?chste kleinstadt leicht mal 200km entfernt und viele Familienv?ter monatelang auf irgendwelchen ?lbohrinseln. Da ist mir aufgefallen - und ich kenne es von Berichten, dass leider einige zur Flasche greifen. Das muss einem bewusst sein, wenn man dort in der "Pampa" wohnt/lebt. Bei einem Urlaub wird einem sowas nicht bewusst.  In Trondheim ist das natrlich anders, da ist einiges mehr geboten. Auch eine sehr sch?ne (alte) Stadt, mit hohem Freizeitwert! (Berge, Wasser, Inseln...) Dort sind auch einige Studis unterwegs. Also besonders fr Naturverbundene sehr zu empfehlen.  Ist das vielleicht ein Dr. med. den du da anstrebst? (wegen deinem nick...)  Dann nix wie weg!!  Da kriegst du Jobs ohne Probleme! Die nehmen dich mit Handkuss, du hast entspannte Arbeitsbedingungen und verdienst das drei- bis vierfache wie in D. (Ein Kollege von mir, Mediziner, h?tte dort sofort nach der Uni anfangen k?nnen, fr ca. 6100 brutto! Nur, wie geagt, die Einsamkeit in diesem Dorf, wo er da war, hat ihn davon abgehalten.)  Nun sind deutsche da natrlich geschichtlich (Weltkrieg) in gewisser Weise "vorbelastet". Mir ist aber niemals Kritik diesbezglich begegnet, schon gar nicht von jungen Leuten. Vielleicht ist das bei ein paar ?lteren anders...  Also ich kann das eigentlich nur empfehlen, ist in jedem Fall eine super Erfahrung, und wenns dir nicht gef?llt hindert dich niemand daran, wieder zurck zu kommen. (Es sei denn, du bleibst an einer dieser bildhbschen NorwegerInnen "h?ngen" ;))|`|d1e9dff5a7abf1decaacfeac567c5d33aa	Norwegen ist ein so wundersch?nes Land, dass man es gar nicht beschreiben kann. Ich glaube, die Norweger sind heute auch nicht mehr deutschfeindlich. Das war mir vor vielen Jahren sehr aufgefallen und hat das Bild etwas getrbt gehabt. Und Trondheim hat einen herrlichen Dom. Und berhaupt: die Fjorde, die Berge, die Landschaft, die D?rfer, die St?dte: man muss das mal gesehen haben - und schon ist man hingerissen und hat sich in das Land unsterblich verliebt.
2a614fbcac9c7c2d8a467309d3727202aa	Me parece que tiene que ver con que la sociedad no nos prepara para hacer valer nuestros derechos y poder exigir lo que nos corresponde. Muchos prefieren callarse para no molestar a otros o para resguardarse del "qu dirn" con una actitud sumisa.

AA12149383	If you're not looking for the area code, then the prefix 654 could be from anywhere. The location depends on the area code. If you knew the area code, then you could figure out what area (within that area code) that the 654 prefix is from, with sites like this: http://proagency.tripod.com/usaphones3.h...|`|wtMOXTMAaa	After the area code is set, then the telephone companies can assign numbers--and they are free to use the same prefixes that are in other area codes.    So, the 654 is quite probably used in many different areas.

Aus meiner Schulzeit habe ich mir kaum Gedichte gemerkt. Ich denke, der Sinn vom Gedicht-auswendig-lernen in der Schule stellt mehr ein allgemeines Ged?chtnistraining dar - was sicherlich effektiv ist, mir aber zum Beispiel die Lyrik fr Jahre verleidet hat.   Erst nach der Schulzeit begann ich mich fr Gedichte wieder zu interessieren, und habe meine Lieblingsgedichte auch auswendig gelernt. Das hatte zwei Grnde: zum einen Ged?chtnistraining ( (-: ) und zum anderen geben mir diese Gedichte Kraft, wenn ich mal nicht mehr weiter wei?.   Dann kommen mir meine Lieblingsgedichte in den Sinn, zum Beispiel "Stufen" von Hesse, "Ich kann dir die Welt nicht zu F?en legen" von Heiner Mller, "am Turme" von Anette von Droste-Hllshoff und und und...   Genau das selbe gilt fr Anekdoten oder Zitate.  sie erfreuen mich, geben mir Kraft und kommen mir immer genau dann in den Sinn wenn sie gerade zur Situation passen.   Ich wrde auch nur Gedichte vortragen, die ich mag, denn sie geben auch einen Teil meiner Pers?nlichkeit wieder und Gedichte werden nur dann ausdrucksvoll, wenn man sie wirklich fhlen kann.     LG|`|a8elWzweaa	Ja, "Die Entwicklung der Menschheit" ist eines der sch?nsten Gedichte gewesen, das wir lernen mussten.    Au?erdem ist, wie schon mehrfach genannt, "Der Zauberlehrling" von Goethe sehr sch?n.    Was ich auch noch fast komplett kann ist Goethes "Prometheus":    Bedecke deinen Himmel, Zeus,  Mit Wolkendunst,  Und be, dem Knaben gleich,  Der Disteln k?pft,   An Eichen dich und Bergesh?hn;  Musst mir meine Erde   Doch lassen stehn  Und mein Htte, die du nicht gebaut,  Und meinen Herd,  Um dessen Glut  Du mich beneidest. ....    usw.    Allgemein gibt es viele Goethe-Gedichte, die man zumindest einmal geh?rt haben oder aus denen man ein, zwei Zeilen wissen sollte, wie z.B. "Wer reitet so sp?t durch Nacht und Wind..." aus dem Erlk?nig ( Ich habe Freunde in Frankreich, die das vor Jahren mal lernen mussten und es immer noch ausw?ndig k?nnen!) oder "...Und doch, welch Glck, geliebt zu werden, und lieben, G?tter, welch ein Glck!" aus "Willkommen und Abschied". Ach, da gibts einfach viel zu viele...    Noch eine letzte Sache: ein paar Faust-Zitate sind auch nicht schlecht:  "Da steh ich nun, ich armer Tor,  und bin so klug als wie zuvor!"  "Hier bin ich Mensch, hier darf ich's sein."  "Das also war des Pudels Kern!"  "Werd ich zum Augenblicke sagen:  Verweile doch! du bist so sch?n!"

Sie atmen modern.  Die Erde ist ein gebildeter Stern  mit sehr viel Wassersplung.    Sie schie?en die Briefschaften durch ein Rohr.  Sie jagen und zchten Mikroben.  Sie versehen die Natur mit allem Komfort.  Sie fliegen steil in den Himmel empor  und bleiben zwei Wochen oben.    Was ihre Verdauung brig l?sst,  das verarbeiten sie zu Watte.   Sie spalten Atome. Sie heilen Inzest.  Und sie stellen durch Stiluntersuchungen fest,  dass C?sar Plattf?e hatte.    So haben sie mit dem Kopf und dem Mund  Den Fortschritt der Menschheit geschaffen.

Also bezglich dem Studium kann ich nichts erz?hlen. Zum Leben grunds?tzlich in China kann ich jedoch etwas beitragen. Also ich bin in meinem Leben schon einige Male umgezogen und China is bislang das Land das mir am wenigsten gefallen hat. Es gibt zwar positive Aspekte wie die Preise, jedoch wenn man einigerma?en an westlichen Produkten festhalten will, bezahlt man meist mehr als in Europa. Au?erdem besteht auch noch die Sprachbarriere, sodass Kontakt zu Chinesen so gut wie nicht m?glich ist, bei den meisten Leuten, die ich kenne, eingeschlossen mich, ist das jedoch kein Problem, da die Meinung ber Chinesen selbst nicht ?u?erst positiv ausf?llt. Somit wird auch der Freundeskreis beschr?nkt sein auf andere Englisch- oder Deutschsprachige. Wobei es in Qingdao vergleichsweise zu Peking recht viele Deutsche gibt, was auch mit der Geschichte zu tun hat. Ich nehme an, dass mit dem Aufenthalt hier in China auch mit dem Lernen des Mandarin verbunden ist. Dieses ist jedoch sehr zeitaufwendig, wie ich selbst erfahren musste.   Was auch nicht zu untersch?tzen ist die Luftverschmutzung in allen Gro?st?den, sodass Werte von ber 250 keine Seltenheit sind. In Deutschland wird glaub ich ab einem Wert von 50 schon Warnungen ausgegeben.Im Allgemeinen wrde ich von einem Studium in China abraten, ich selbst kann es auch nicht mehr abwarten hier wieder wegzukommen, ebenso geht es allen, die ich kenne.

Seitdem hei?t das Physikum nicht mehr Physikum, sondern 1.?rztliche Prfung (1. ?P,Ist aber das gleiche in grn *gg*)    1.-4. Semester Vorklink   Theorie ohne Ende (Anatomie, Physiologie, Terminologie, Psychologie, Soziologie, Histologie, Chemie, Biologie, Physik, Biochemie,hoffe ich hab nix vergessen,ist bei mir schon 4 Jahre her)    nach dem 4. Semester 1.?P  schriftlich: alles aus der Vorklinik  mndlich: Anatomie, Biochemie, Physiologie    5.-8. Semester  alle klinischen F?cher (Innere, Chirurgie, Urologie usw. (alles worauf man auch nen Facharzt machen kann), theoretische F?cher wie Mikrobiologie, Pharmakologie und dann neuerdings auch so tolle F?cher wie Gesundheit?konomie, Pr?vention und Gesundheitsf?rderung und andere, insges. sind es ca. 35 F?cher und jede mit mind. 1 KLausur)    9.-10. Semester  Praktikas in versch. F?chern, je 1-4 Wochen, F?cher sind vorgeschrieben, z.T. mit mndlich - praktischer Prfung hinterher    11.-12. Semester  PJ (je 4 Monate in Innere, Chirurgie und einem Wahlfach), also 1 Jahr gratis (nein, dafr gibt es KEIN Geld!) Vollzeit (je nach Klinik 8-10 Stunden am Tag) in den Kliniken fr den Staat arbeiten. Was man machen darf h?ngt von den Kliniken und dortigen ?rzten ab, wenn du Pech hast, nur die Idiotenjobs, die kein Arzt machen will (Haken halten im OP, Blutabnehmen, Aufnahmegespr?che....)    nach dem 12. Semester  2.?P  schriftlich: alles ab 5. Semester und die Grundlagen aus den ersten 4 Semestern  mndlich: die 3 F?cher aus dem PJ plus ein zugelostes Fach    Wenn du alles bestehst, musst du durch ein Brokratiechaos, damit du deine Approbation bekommst, in der Landes?rztekammer registriert wirst usw.    Und dann ist man Arzt/?rztin.    Die Prfungen (1. und 2. ?P)  werden vom impp in Mainz gestellt (www.impp.de) und sind fr alle Studenten eines Semesters in ganz Deutschland gleich.  Neuerdings gibt es reformierte Studieng?nge in Heidelberg und Mannheim, die aber noch in den Kinderschuhen stecken. In Mannheim hei?t der MARECUM, Heidelberg so ?hnlich (HERECUM glaube ich, bin mir aber nicht sicher), auch K?ln und ein paar andere St?dte haben solch Modellstudieng?nge.    Die Promotion (Doktorarbeit) macht man neben dem Studium her ( meist ab dem 6. oder 7. Semester), da man nach der Uni da kaum dazu kommt zeitlich. Wenn man dann die Approbation hat, kann man das Promotionsverfahren einreichen (dauert im Schnitt wohl so 6 Monate), wenn das dann auch vorbei ist, darf man sich Dr.med. nennen.    Regelstudienzeit: 12 Semester und 3 Monate (schaffen aber die wenigsten)|`|29c0f181f13928f1f626908e0bd2b179aa	Am besten guggst du bei google und suchst nach "Fachschaft Medizin".

But here is a basic overview of how you might start it. You are going two long flexible items (wires probably) that are parallel to each other but twist like a mirror image. The nucleic acids (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) have to be paired accordingly. A binds to T and G to C.  Adenine and guanine are your purines and they are "longer" than your pyrimidines, T and C. So take that into account. To be really specific, in the A - T bond, there meet at 2 points, and the G - C bond meet at 3. So you might want to show the two and three bonds respectively on your model. And also when you twist the opposite strands, you have to account for the grooves which you can see in your picture as a major and minor. This just means it looks like the groove is deeper in one end and not as deep on the other. I hope this helps! I know its sounds a bit complex but the DNA helix is one of my favorite biological structures!!|`|KT3Q8QUuaa	These links might help.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA  http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7615...  http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7615...

b1ea90473928ce05aaf0c2898cc14b05aa	Hello,    Very Easy.  --------------------------------------...                                          SIMPLE TENSES  --------------------------------------...  1)    The PRESENT TENSE indicates that an action is present, now, relative to the speaker or writer. Generally, it is used to describe actions that are factual or habitual -- things that occur in the present but that are not necessarily happening right now:                      Singular                     Plural                       I am                         we are                       you are                    you are                       he/she/it is              they are     2)      The PAST TENSE indicates that an action is in the past relative to the speaker or writer.when the time period has finished,when the time period is definite,with for, when the action is finished.                        Singular                      Plural                          I was                        we were                          you were                  you were                          he/she/it was           they were     3)        The FUTURE TENSE indicates that an action is in the future relative to the speaker or writer. There are no inflected forms for the future in English (nothing like those -ed or -s endings in the other tenses). Instead, the future tense employs the helping verbs will or shall with the base form of the verb                                 Singular                  Plural                                I will be                    we will be                                you will be               you will be                                he/she/it will be       they will be   --------------------------------------...                                      PERFECT TENSES  --------------------------------------...  1) The PRESENT PERFECT TENSE is formed with a present tense form of "to have" plus the past participle of the verb (which can be either regular or irregular in form). This tense indicates either that an action was completed (finished or "perfected") at some point in the past or that the action extends to the present                                    Singular                     Plural                                    I have been               we have been                                    you have been          you have been                                    he/she/it has been    they have been     2) The PAST PROGRESSIVE TENSE indicates continuing action, something that was happening, going on, at some point in the past. This tense is formed with the helping "to be" verb, in the past tense, plus the present participle of the verb (with an -ing ending):                               Singular                      Plural                              I was being                we were being                              you were being          you were being                              he/she/it was being   they were being     3)     The FUTURE PERFECT TENSE indicates that an action will have been completed (finished or "perfected") at some point in the future. This tense is formed with "will" plus "have" plus the past participle of the verb (which can be either regular or irregular in form):                                  Singular                            Plural                                I will have been                 we will have been                                you will have been            you will have been                                he/she/it will have been    they will have been     3)    The FUTURE PROGRESSIVE TENSE indicates continuing action, something that will be happening, going on, at some point in the future. This tense is formed with the modal "will" plus "be," plus the present participle of the verb (with an -ing ending):     Singular                        Plural   There is no future progressive for the "to be" verb. "Will be being" is expressed simply as "will be": "We will be being happy."|`|647e9fe26ee066003b90e16122312dc2aa	Generally, "perfect" means "something that happened in the past, and viewed from a later time".  "Present" means that time is now (indicated with "have"); "Past" means that the time is past (indicated with "had").  "Continuous" means it was a continuing event rather than an intermittent one (indicated with "have been").    "Continuous" is indicated with the present participle ("-ing"). The non-continuous are indicated with the "past participle", which in English is generally just adding "-d" or "-ed" (e.g. "typed" or "punched") but for which many common words have irregulars, often ending in "-en" (spoken, written, eaten) or but not always (come).    Present perfect: something that happened at some unspecified in the past    [HAS / HAVE] + [past participle]    "I have seen that movie many times."    Past perfect: Something that happened before something in the past.    [HAD] + [PAST PARTICIPLE]    "I had studied a little English when I came to the U.S."    Present perfect continuous: Something that has been happening in the past, without interruption, and continues until now.    [HAS / HAVE] + [BEEN] + [VERB+ing]    "I have been waiting here for two hours."    You didn't ask, but the "future perfect continuous" would be "will have been waiting": it's perfect (talking about a time in the past) from the future perspective.     In English, "continuous" is also called "progressive".  There are subtle differences between the two in other languages, but the terms aren't used consistently.
31005bf3b304e76124f49446b1cd2258aa	I don't really understand what you are trying to say but maybe I need to clarify exactly what significant figures are. If the question asks for the answer to be given to two sig figs, it means that it only wants the first two digits of the answer, and the rest to be filled in with 0s, to make it approximately the right size.     So for example, 8713 written to two sig figs.    The first two digits of the answer are 8 and 7. We then look at the next digit to see if we need to do any rounding (over five and we round up the number before).  The next number is 1 so we don't need to round up.    So the number, written to two sig figs would be 8700.    I hope this helps you with your answer. (You are thinking of writing numbers in standard form where you do the x10 bit-not sig figs.)

Pennsylvania farmers were refusing to pay a tax and he sent troops to ensure compliance.    2. In foreign affairs, Washington was a huge proponent of neutrality. In fact, he declared the Proclamation of Neutrality in 1793 which stated that the US would be impartial toward belligerent powers currently in a war. This upset some who felt we owed a greater allegiance to France. However, his belief in neutrality was reiterated during his Farewell Address in 1796 where he warned against foreign entanglements. This warning became part of the American political landscape as seen in the issues that arose around joining World War I and World War II.    Washington signed Jay's Treaty which gave away the United States' right to neutrality of the seas allowing the British to search and seize anything they found on American ships travelling into ports of Britain's enemies. In return, the British withdrew from outposts in the Northwest Territory. This forestalled further conflict with Great Britain until 1812.    In 1795, Pinckney's Treaty helped relations with Spain by creating a boundary between the United States and Spanish held Florida. Further, the US was allowed to travel the entire Mississippi for purpose of trade. In the end, George Washington should be considered one of our most important and influential presidents of all time whose legacy still lives on today.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Do you own homework, home work HELP is just that help for you to FIND the answers, NOT to do your homework for you.

HK1j2gDJaa	Music in the schools give children an outlet for self expression, allows them to learn about cultures of other people (African tribal music, Russian peasant music, jazz music from America), and allows them to engage in a productive activity. Music also promotes critical thinking (  counting, singing, listening, thinking ahead to the next musical phrase and how to ge there; this is sometimes done at the same time), and to give children a chance to be creative.    In some specialized music activities such as band, students learn the concept of teamwork. Everybody must do their part in order for the group to be successful. It promotes self-discipline in that students are expected to show up to class and practices on time all the time.      Students who have a natural knack for music are often spotted by teachers who help the student develop his/her musical talent throughout school. This is a good thing for students who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds (poorer families) because they can have a chance to attend college on a music scholarship and receive an education.|`|aab57b336446508e5c8a01c01c4135ceaa	well i am in band and i would say it is a good experience for kids especially if their family doesn't have enough money to take lessons. Sometimes the school provides instruments and the teachers help them learn how to play. It is also good to learn in a band because you learn how to play as a band and don't just play by yourself. By doing that you learn to adjust yourself and your sound to the other players and get some good leadership in.   That is my opinion anyway.
AA11318945	The whistle works by causing the smooth flow of air to be split by a narrow blade, sometimes called a fipple, creating a turbulent vortex which causes the air to vibrate. By attaching a resonant chamber to the basic whistle, it may be tuned to a particular note and made louder. The length of the chamber typically defines the resonant frequency. A whistle may also contain a small light ball, usually called the pea, which rattles around inside, creating a chaotic vibrato effect that intensifies the sound. Japanese bird whistles use several small balls and are half filled with water in order to reproduce the sound of a bird song.|`|752655df2093a479d817a969f17a84f4aa	some whistles work by splitting the air as it passes through. this is what the slanted piece after the blow hole, it splits the air making a whistling sound.

By forcing air to pass suddenly through a narrow aperture it will set up a vibration as it is suddenly compressed and then decompressed. The frequency will depend on the size of the aperture- smaller openings make higher frequencies.

AA12237125	Normally you will need at least 3 A grade A levels (preferably 4) in academic subjects (ie they don't like Art/drama/design subjects) They get a high nimber of very good applicants per place so competition is tough. I guess you are americain, i don't know how A Levels relate to GPA but I would imagine you need an almost perfect score and/or to be in about the top 5% of your Class    Socially be honest about your activities but it dosent hurt to get involved in a fair bit. they do like music/ drama/ creative things here as well as sports, leadership things (team captain, school president), Organisational things (ie social events, charity events etc) Volunteering for charities looks good too. Also any work/work experience you do that is relevant to the degree you want to take is good ie. volunteering in a hospital for medicine or work experience with a solicitor for Law.    Obviously don't lie about what you do but if you've got time do try and get involved in a few of the activities and remember that these are quite standard suggestions so see it you can think of anything a bit unusual to make you stand out from the crowd.

i5tOQGgFaa	Is there a specific skill you want to do?  Here's some that we've done in the last 3 weeks.    * Rhyming Apple Tree.  I drew my apple tree on a magnetic dry erase board.  I made pairs of apples with pictures and laminated and placed a magnet on the back.  Then the children matched the rhyming pairs...to add another literacy component I wrote the word above the apple, focusing on the beginning sound.    * We measured with apples (I have wood and plastic small apples).  I had a variety of objects to measure.   We measured and stamped the numeral onto the paper next to the pic of the object and then traced the item.  We also arranged from smallest to largest.    * We did a dictation project.  They were provided with squirrel, bare tree cutouts, foamie circles (sun), cotton balls (clouds), leaf/acron/pumpkin mini stickers.  They created a scene on a half sheet of blue construction paper.  We glued it to the top of a full sheet of white construction paper and they dictated a story as I wrote it down.  Of course they wrote their "author's signature" on the bottom.    * We have squirrel cards with the number on the tail.  Quite possibly it was off of www.childcareland.com's free printables.  Not sure but I'm sure if you search squirrels and numbers you will find them.  Anyway... they put corresponding number of cheerios.  We talked about 1st, last, more, less, did simple addition, and of course they ate the cheerios.  If you have more advanced you could incorporate skip counting, odd/even, etc.    * We have introduced the letters m,s, long e, a, t, and r.  For a review I added a construction paper circle to a cd and wrote the capital and lower case letters  on them.  I provided 4 clothespins for each cd with the capital and lower case letters on the end.  As they put the clothespins onto the cd they said the letter sound.  Some gave me words that start with that sound.  You can make it theme related by adding sticker or coloring the clothespins fall colors.    * Silly Sally Squirrel (there is actually a little song that goes with it if you are interested.)  I attached a squirrel to a paper bag.  I had acorns with the majority of them beginning with "s" sounds.  We looked at the picture, stated the object's name and decided if it began with /s/.  (Because Silly Sally is very picky about the acorns she's collecting).  You could do other concepts with this same activity.    * we had gourds, indian corn, acorns, etc. out for exploration.  I provided a scale with weight bears, maginfy glass, ruler, paper/crayons, etc.  We did all sorts of information gathering and documenting.    * we went "fishing".  This is not a "seasonal" activity but they loved it.  I placed magnet letters in a wash tub of water.  We used a magnetic fishing pole and sorted.  Once we sorted Aa's and not Aa's.  Other times we sorted by whether they are made of sticks, curves, or both.  You can use magnet numbers as well and do sequencing, more/less, odd/even, moving corresponding amount of times etc.  You can make it theme related by added images/stickers/magnets to your sorting board.  For example I had a magnetic dry erase board that we worked with and I have used fall window clings and magnets to make something theme related.    Of course we did a lot of scissors, art, and non themed related activities but I'm not thinking you are interested in those activities.  :-)  Hopefully, one of those can be a "jumping board" for you.

We read it everyday in the week.  As the week goes on the kids are able to read it with you. By the end of the week they may be able to read it to you.  As an extension activity we took pictures of every child in the class, the teachers and the group as a whole. Then the children decorated their page.  We put their picture on their page and wrote: "I see XXX looking at me?"  and   " XXX, XXX, who do your see?" In the Brown Bear book a page would say, "Brown Bear, Brown Bear what do you see?"  and  "I see a red bird looking at me"  THEN you turn the page to see the red bird.  We write everything to do with XXX on the page with the picture.  It seems less confusing to the children.  We put each page in a page protector and clip in a 3 ring binder. The children take turns taking the binder home to read to their parents. They are learning how to use a book and that written words are needed in order to tell the story.

Un giorno, ad esempio, ho letto un episodio della vita di Gandhi ke mi ha particolarmente colpito: Un d, mentre Gandhi si stava lavando le mani cn la sua "dose" di acqua discuteva cn un uomo ricco di un paese dell'Asia. Parlando nn si accorse ke stava finendo tutta la sua acqua e quando finalmente se ne rese conto cominci a piangere. L'uomo vedendolo gli chiese: Gli rispose:Allora l'uomo disse: Ma Gandhi, ancora in lacrime, rispose:  Io nn sono stata molto brava a raccontarla, ma credetemi, letta dal testo originale fa veramente capire quanto Gandhi fosse un uomo giusto!!!

A su lado el agente de la CIA Flix Rodrguez. La Higuera (Bolivia), 9 de octubre de 1967.  En el combate de Quebrada del Yuro, Guevara fue herido de bala en su pierna izquierda, hecho prisionero junto con Simen Cuba (?Willy?) y trasladado a La Higuera donde fueron recluidos en la escuela, en aulas separadas. All colocaran tambin los cadveres de los guerrilleros muertos y tambin sera recludo al da siguiente, Juan Pablo Chang. Entre las pertenencias secuestradas por los militares estaba el Diario que el Che llevaba en Bolivia.  El 9 de octubre por la ma?ana el gobierno de Bolivia anunci que Ernesto Guevara haba muerto en combate el da anterior. Simultneamente llegaron el coronel Joaqun Zenteno Anaya y el agente de la CIA Flix Rodrguez. Poco despus del medioda el presidente Barrientos di la orden de asesinar al Che Guevara. Existen dudas y versiones contradictorias sobre el grado de apoyo que la decisin tuvo por parte de Estados Unidos[121], pero lo cierto es que, tal como est registrado en el propio informe secreto de Flix Rodriguez, la CIA estaba presente en el lugar, fue el agente Rodrguez quien recibi la orden de fusilar a Guevara y quien la transmiti a los oficiales bolivianos, as como fue l tambin quien le comunic al Che Guevara que sera fusilado[122].  Escuela de La Higuera, donde estuvo prisionero y fue asesinado el Che Guevara  Antes del fusilamiento Flix Rodrguez lo interrog y lo sac del aula para sacarle varias fotografas, las ltimas en las que aparece con vida. El propio Rodrguez relata ese momento de este modo:  Sal de la habitacin, aquello estaba lleno de soldados afuera. Me dirig al Sargento Tern que sabia que estaba siendo de ejecutor de todo eso. Le dije, sargento hay instrucciones de su gobierno de eliminar al prisionero. Me puse la mano al nivel de la barbilla. No le tire de aqu para arriba, trele de aqu para abajo pues se supone que este hombre haya muerto de heridas en combate. Si mi capitn, si mi capitn dijo. Eran aproximadamente la una de la tarde de Bolivia. De ah entonces me retire al lugar avanzado donde yo haba fotografiado el diario y a la una y diez aproximadamente escuche una rfaga peque?a.[123]  Poco antes Simen Cuba y Juan Pablo Chang haban corrido la misma suerte. En 1977 la revista Paris Match entrevist a Mario Tern quien relat del siguiente modo los ltimos instantes del Che Guevara:  Dud 40 minutos antes de ejecutar la orden. Me fui a ver al coronel Prez con la esperanza de que la hubiera anulado. Pero el coronel se puso furioso. As es que fui. se fue el peor momento de mi vida. Cuando llegu, el Che estaba sentado en un banco. Al verme dijo: ?Usted ha venido a matarme?. Yo me sent cohibido y baj la cabeza sin responder. Entonces me pregunt: ??Qu han dicho los otros?? Le respond que no haban dicho nada y l contest: ??Eran unos valientes!? Yo no me atrev a disparar. En ese momento vi al Che grande, muy grande, enorme. Sus ojos brillaban intensamente. Senta que se echaba encima y cuando me mir fijamente, me dio un mareo. Pens que con un movimiento rpido el Che podra quitarme el arma. ??Pngase sereno me dijo y apunte bien! ?Va a matar a un hombre!? Entonces di un paso atrs, hacia el umbral de la puerta, cerr los ojos y dispar la primera rfaga. El Che, con las piernas destrozadas, cay al suelo, se contorsion y empez a regar muchsima sangre. Yo recobr el nimo y dispar la segunda rfaga, que lo alcanz en un brazo, en el hombro y en el corazn. Ya estaba muerto.     Sus restos    Lavadero del hospital Nuestro Se?or de Malta, en Vallegrande, donde se expuso el cadver del Che Guevara  La tarde del 9 de octubre el cuerpo del Che Guevara fue llevado en helicptero a Vallegrande y fue colocado en el lavadero del hospital Nuestro Se?or de Malta, donde permaneci en exhibicin pblica durante ese da y todo el da siguiente, introducindosele gran cantidad de formaldehdo para evitar la descomposicin.  Cientos de personas (soldados, pobladores, curiosos, periodistas) concurrieron a ver el cuerpo. Hay gran cantidad de fotos de esos momentos, en las que el Che aparece con los ojos abiertos. Las monjas del hospital y las mujeres de la villa se?alaron su parecido con Jesucristo y cortaron mechones de su pelo para preservarlos como talismanes[125]. Los soldados y funcionarios se quedaron con cosas que llevaba el Che al morir. Debido a que ya estaba decidido que se hara desaparecer el cuerpo del Che Guevara, como el del resto de los guerrilleros, la noche del 10 de octubre se le cortaron las manos al cadver para conservarlas como prueba de la muerte.  Existen diversas versiones sobre el destino final del cadver. El General Juan Jos Torres declar que el cuerpo haba sido cremado, mientras que el General Alfredo Ovando afirm lo contrario. Hay consenso entre los militares bolivianos presentes en el lugar de que la orden de cremacin fue real pero que no pudo ser ejecutada por carecer de los medios adecuados y tambin debido al hecho de una eventual reaccin negativa de la poblacin debido al hecho de que en Bolivia la cremacin era ilegal[126]. Tambin exista cierto consenso sobre el hecho de que el cadver del Che fue enterrado en la madrugada del 11 de octubre por el teniente coronel Selich, en una fosa diferente de los otros seis guerrilleros  El 28 de junio de 1997 un equipo cientficos cubanos encontraron en Vallegrande siete cuerpos enterrados clandestinamente en una sola fosa comn, e identificaron entre ellos, con apoyo del prestigioso Equipo Argentino de Antropologa Forense, al de Ernesto Guevara y los de cuatro de sus hombres.

Queste differenze sono dovute al fatto che un punto sullequatore descrive una circonferenza pi lunga che non un punto posto ad una latitudine superiore; un punto sul polo nord o sud ha velocit nulla in quanto nulla  la lunghezza della circonferenza che percorre.Stiamo parlando di velocit lineare, che aumenta dallequatore ai poli ma anche dal centro della Terra verso lesterno.    Se consideriamo invece la velocit angolare,cio langolo descritto dal raggio vettore di un dato punto della Terra nellunit di tempo, osserviamo che essa  uguale per tutti i punti in quanto tutti descrivono un angolo di 360 nello stesso tempo.    Conseguenza del moto di rotazione sono il moto apparente della sfera celeste e lalternarsi del d e della notte.    I raggi del Sole arrivano sulla Terra paralleli fra loro e in ogni momento illuminano met della superficie terrestre. La sezione che divide la parte rischiarata da quella in ombra  chiamata circolo dilluminazione.    In rapporto alle diverse posizione assunte dal Sole durante la giornata, varia anche il flusso di energia erogata da un determinato punto della superficie terrestre.Al mattino,i suoi raggi sfiorano appena la superficie terrestre e vi incidono con angoli acuti. A mezzogiorno il Sole  alto in cielo e i suoi raggi impattano sulla Terra con angoli pi grandi,vicini o uguali  a 90, i flussi energetici sono pi concentrati, la riflessione  minore. Al tramonto si ripetono le condizioni dellalba.Di notte linsolazione  ovviamente assente.    Dopo alcuni studi si  notato che  presente un lento e costante incremento della durata del giorno; tale aumento  molto piccolo ed ammonta a circa 0,0016 s per secolo; si tratta a tutti gli effetti di una diminuzione della velocit di rotazione, quindi unaccelerazione  determinata dalla forza dattrito generata dalle maree; sono presenti piccole fluttuazioni del periodo di rotazione, che determinano variazioni della durata del giorno, con effetti anche stagionali, senza alterare il valore medio annuale; le evidenze osservate derivano da fluttuazioni del moto lunare, attribuibili solo a fluttuazioni a fluttuazioni della velocit di rotazione della terra; si  anche appurato che la velocit di rotazione  minore in primavera che in autunno.                                         LA RIVOLUZIONE TERRESTRE         La rivoluzione terrestre  il movimento che la Terra compie in un anno solare, attorno al Sole, muovendosi lungo un tragitto o orbita a forma di ellisse chiamata ECLITTICA.        ECLITTICA:cerchio massimo che il Sole, nel suo moto apparente intorno alla Terra, descrive in un anno sulla sfera celeste.    Per comprendere bene le importanti conseguenze del moto di rivoluzione occorre precisare che lasse terrestre  inclinato di 66 33 sul piano delleclittica e che il piano dellorbita  inclinato di 2327 sul piano dellequatore.    La lunghezza dellorbita terrestre  di quasi 938.900.000 km, e la Terra la percorre alla velocit di 106.000 km/h. In accordo con la seconda legge di Keplero, la velocit della Terra non  costante in tutti i punti dellorbita ma  massima al perielio e minima allafelio.    Linclinazione dellasse terrestre  la causa dellalternarsi delle stagioni.    Il 22 dicembre i raggi solari cadono per pedicolari al parallelo chiamato Tropico del Capricorno; il circolo dilluminazione  tangente ai circoli polari; il Polo Nord  completamente in ombra mentre il Polo Sud  illuminato per tutte le 24 ore. Nellemisfero nord si ha la massima durata della notte e la pi breve durata del giorno,il contrario avviene nellemisfero sud. Nella Terra tutto ci avviene nel giorno del solstizio dinverno.    Dal 23 dicembre al 21 marzo il circolo dilluminazione va inclinandosi in maniera tale che aumentano le ore di luce nellemisfero nord e diminuiscono nellemisfero sud.          Il 21 marzo i raggi solari cadono perfettamente perpendicolari sullequatore, il circolo dilluminazione coincide con un meridiano e passa per entrambi i poli.Le ore dilluminazione sono pari alle ore di oscuramento sia nellemisfero nord che nellemisfero sud.Questo fenomeno  chiamato equinozio di primavera.    Dal 21 marzo al 21 giugno continuano ad aumentare le ore dilluminazione nellemisfero nord mentre diminuiscono nellemisfero sud.          Il 21 giugno i raggi solari sono perpendicolari al parallelo chiamato Tropico del Cancro; il circolo dilluminazione  tangente ai circoli polari; si ha la massima durata del giorno nellemisfero nord e la minima nellemisfero sud.Il polo sud rimane buio per 24 ore. Questo avviene nel giorno del solstizio destate.    Dal 21 giugno al 23  settembre il circolo dilluminazione va inclinandosi in maniera tale che aumentano le ore del giorno nellemisfero sud e diminuiscono nellemisfero nord.          Il 23 settembre il circolo dilluminazione coincide con un meridiano e passa per entrambi i poli. I raggi solari sono perpendicolari allequatore. Le ore dilluminazione sono pari alle ore doscuramento sia nellemisfero nord che nellemisfero sud. E chiamato equinozio dautunno il giorno in cui si presenta il fenomeno appena descritto.    Dal 24 settembre al 22 dicembre continuano ad aumentare le ore dilluminazione nellemisfero sud mentre dimin
N4vVhEATaa	I'm a preschool teacher. Typicall if you're a preschool teacher it's through a Learning Center or church program etc. To work in public schools you need to become a Prek teacher and that involves a degree. But, for a preschool teacher, pay is low. Not that it's amazing for a public school teacher, but it's lower outside of that. This will vary state to state, county to county, but the average preschool teacher where I live makes (averaged out) $7 an hour. I'm not sure where you're from but check your local centers and see.     And also, you do not have to have something like ECEP in order to do this. The most that most places require is SOMETIMES a CDA, Child Development Credential. I would do some research in your local programs and see what they require. If you are going to do the ECEP, I suggest you go another 2 years and just get a degree in Early Childhood Development like me. In Oklahoma, you can teach all the way to 3rd grade in public schools with that where pay and other aspects are so much better. Good luck!|`|7dT69hgJaa	You are on the right track by attending your local college. Start there as this will give you a great introduction into the field. However; anymore BA or BS are most desirable for preschool teachers. I've been in this field for many many many years and I have seen it go from just needing a High School diploma to a College degree.   People don't go into this field to become a millionaire, that's for sure. Your personal rewards are what the real pay off is. You can live on this salary but you won't get rich.   Early Childhood is an expanding field with much concentration on how children develop. It is no longer a glorified babysitting service.  Personally I think this is a great choice, but I am biased. Good Luck to you.|`|AA11142889	The salary of a typical preschool teacher is dismal.  It's a sad commentary on our society that we pay people who do the most important job such a low salary.    I work in a preschool, but I'm a special ed teacher with a master's degree, so I'm paid a little better.  Teachers who work in public schools earn more money.    Of course, the biggest pay off is making a profound difference in the lives of young children.|`|8SmAx9veaa	Taking the 2 year program at your local college is a good start for a Preschool teacher. That is what I started with and at first all I planed on getting. But one of my teachers helped me to understand that a 2 year is not going to cut it anymore.  The 4 year is a great thing to have and it will help with everything else down the road.    I know some places will higher you with out the 2 year or more but it does help getting the job and help with pay, I know this one from experience, before I had any degree it was hard for some of the places around here to consider me since one I am a man and I had no support from a college. Once I got my first degree I was able to get a job right away.    The pay is not what we deserve just like any other teacher but we get to something better then money. If you love your job and love children then when you can see them finally make the connection you have been trying to get them to make that smile on their face is worth more then  money.  Knowing when you have a bad day the children seem to be extra sweet to you and hug twice as much because they love their teacher is my favorite part of anything. |`|mAJXmrpSaa	I currently work in a preschool and make $13.50 an hour, but I've also been working in preschools since I was 16, I'm 22 now. It is THE most rewarding job in the world! I know our community college offers the work program *not sure of the actual name* and you working in a preschool counts as some credits towards the course. You can google salary pay for preschool teachers and it gives you multiple websites for the pay rates. Good luck!|`|52e96f7234922ac89a3f03d6d8a3e03eaa	The salaries for ECE's usually aren't that great.  I'm only earning $9.00 an hour at the daycare where I work.  The average salary around here is between $13-$15.  If you work in larger cities the salaries become higher.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	The pre school teachers where I live make about 12-15 dollars(w/experience) I live in suburbs of a major city. I think teachers w/ less experience make 9-10 dollars per hour  I think having first aide or CPR would certificate  would be a major advantage. Also  a lot of experience w/kids. I think the school I used to work at also gave  a cost of living increase each year as well.

Bis zu 30 g Sekret befindet sich in einer walnussgro?en Drse am Bauch des Hirsches vor den Geschlechtsorganen. Zur Gewinnung des Moschus wird dem erlegten Tier die Drse entfernt und getrocknet, wobei die ursprnglich salbenartige rotbraune Masse schwarz und k?rnig-pulvrig wird. ?hnliche Substanzen finden sich auch in der Bisamratte und Zibet-Katze.    Moschus hat die unerreichte F?higkeit, eine Parfm-Komposition zu beleben, die Ausstrahlung zu verst?rken, zu harmonisieren und abzurunden. Man unterscheidet im Handel im wesentlichen vier Sorten: den als beste Sorte gebr?uchlichen Tonkin-Moschus aus China und Tibet, den Assam- od. Bengal-Moschus aus Indien, den Russischen-Moschus und den preiswerten Bucharischen Moschus. Wegen seines gro?en Wertes wird Moschus h?ufig verf?lscht.    Moschus ist seit dem Altertum die am meisten gesch?tzte tierische Droge als Heilmittel gegen jede Art von Beschwerden und besonders als Grundstoff fr die Zubereitung von Parfms.

Er enth?lt Bestandteile, die Struktur?hnlichkeiten zu Pheromonen haben. Diese sollen eine aphrodisierende Wirkung haben.  Ursprnglich wurde nur das Sekret aus einer Drse des Moschushirsches "Moschus" genannt. Bereits im Altertum war Moschus ber die Vermittlung durch die Perser bekannt; Moschushirsche lebten an den Ostgrenzen ihres Reiches. blicherweise werden die Tiere get?tet, und die Drse wird ihnen entfernt. Erst im 20. Jahrhundert begann man mit Versuchen, lebenden Moschushirschen in Farmen das Sekret zu entnehmen.    Der Begriff "Moschus" wird heute auch auf Drsensekrete anderer Tiere und auch auf Pflanzens?fte angewandt, die einen ?hnlichen Geruch haben. Unter den Tieren sondern Moschusochsen, Moschusb?cke, Bisamratten und Moschusenten solchen "falschen Moschus" ab; bei den Pflanzen sind dies die Gauklerblume und der Abelmoschus.    Seit 1888 wird Moschus auch auf synthetischem Wege hergestellt. Dem Chemiker Albert Baur gelang als erstem die Herstellung von knstlichem Moschus. Der Begehrtheit des tierischen Originalmoschus tut dies allerdings wenig Abbruch, vor allem, da er auch in der Traditionellen Chinesischen Medizin Bedeutung hat und dort kein synthetischer Ersatzstoff eingesetzt wird.    Industriell werden vor allem polyzyklische Moschusersatzstoffe statt des natrlichen Moschus fr die Parfmierung von Kosmetika und Waschmitteln eingesetzt. Es handelt sich dabei meist um Gemische aus Substanzen mit den Handelsnamen Galaxolid und Tonalid, seltener auch Celestolid und Pantolid. Polyzyklische Moschusersatzstoffe reichern sich im Fettgewebe an, ihre Verwendung in Kosmetikprodukten ist umstritten. Aufgrund ihrer schweren Abbaubarkeit werden sie durch die Abwasseraufbereitungsprozesse in kommunalen Kl?ranlagen nur teilweise aus den Abw?ssern entfernt. Daher sind Galaxolid und Tonalid, untergeordnet auch Celestolid und Pantolid in Wasser, Sedimenten und Schwebstoffen aller deutschen Flsse nachweisbar.    Und, um Deine Frage um das "Warum" zu beantworten: die Leute  assoziieren "Moschus" mit dem "Moschusochsen", weil ihnen das grundlegende Wissen zu dem Thema abgeht.

6c9a18e5e1593833dbf6de0331df5ddfaa	Elis Regina  No mapa numerolgico de Elis o nmero 44 colocou o poder e a autoridade nas m?os dela, fazendo com que seus ideais fossem muito maiores do que ela mesma poderia imaginar alcan?ar.    Possua a for?a de um le?o, defendia seus propsitos com unhas e dentes. Esta caracterstica fez com que as pessoas a vissem como uma "panela de press?o" pronta para explodir a qualquer instante (talvez seja por esta raz?o que tenha ficado conhecida como Pimentinha entre os mais ntimos), algum que n?o media esfor?os para falar o que pensava e o que sentia. Ao que tudo indica ela racionalizava os sentimentos, tentando entender os porqus de tudo. Sua mente era ativa e inquieta.    Passava a imagem de seguran?a e auto-confian?a exacerbadas e de certa forma radical. Para ela era oito ou oitenta indo de um extremo ao outro com muita facilidade.    Se mostrava ao mundo de maneira dinamica, autoritria e emanava um poder capaz de dominar qualquer situa??o, e necessitava da sensa??o de controlar a tudo e a todos, chegando a ser cruel consigo mesma.     Na Bblia:  e) Outro caso interessante: O prximo nmero a aparecer depois do 42  o 45. Notavelmente, o 44 tambm est fora. Uma das raz?es claras  que, se 4  o nmero da terra e 11 o do fracasso ou das coisas incompletas, 44 (4 x 11) significaria MUNDO FRACASSADO OU INCOMPLETO. Mas aps o 42 (isto , aps o RETORNO DE CRISTO), o MUNDO SER RESTAURADO, e A GLRIA DO SENHOR ENCHER A TERRA COMO AS GUAS COBREM O MAR. N?o h mais lugar para esse mundo incompleto.     f) O nmero 44  o contrrio de 48, pois este (que  4 x 12) significa um MUNDO PERFEITO, ou GOVERNO PERFEITO. Um dia o mundo (nmero 4) ser agraciado com a presen?a da Jerusalm Celeste (a Santa Cidade que descer do Cu).

The alternative will be to burn out and lose all the benefits of your hard work so far.    As far as wanting to go out with your friends, it is understandable, but maybe you can hang out with friends who are as serious about their studies as you are. Maybe study together or go out less frequently. If you can adjust your life to a more reasonable activity level, you won't have such a strong desire to escape.

If you don't mark the data as something to remember, it won't go into memory (that's why you underline or highlight written material, or make a mental note to remember something that is said, or write down important information).     You learn best when you actively process incoming data (this means you need to be an active learner, thinking along with the speaker in a lecture, or following the main ideas of the author of a book). You forgetnot because it isn't still in memorybut because you can't retrieve it. Successful learners use strategies to encode their information so they can readily retrieve it.

YYweKXzkaa	ciao, io ho fatto un p di lezioni private quando ho iniziato l'universit. puoiscrivere nell'annuncio in cosa sei diplomata, che sei laureanda in...(quello che studi), che hai una spiccata predisposizione all'insegnamento e ai bambini e segnalare su quali materie vuoi dare lezioni, comunque se le vuoi fare ai bambini delle elementari non c' bisogno di scriverlo,tanto sarai sicuramente in grado di fare tutte le materie, magari con quelli delle medie o superiori  pi opportuno.  io lo l'annuncio lo metterei nelle bacheche delle bibblioteche pubbliche, in quelle dei centri commerciali e se te le fanno mettere in locali come pizzerie d'asporto etc...le mamme che portano a fare merenda i loro pargoli tanto non mancano mai! io mi facevo pagare tra i 7 i 10 l'ora a seconda di quante volte la settimana ci andavo e da quanto c'era da lavorare con l'infante!. ovvio  che se dai lezione ad un ragazzo tutti i giorni, come facevo io, chiederai un p di meno.buon lavoro!          x l2agazza....se uno NON laureato e quindi diplomato mi chiedesse 20 euro per una ripetizione mi farei una bella risata e gli direi che a quella cifra (o  poco di pi) assumo uno che  gi laureato|`|XpBP417taa	Non so dove abiti, ma non fidarti di chi chiede poco tipo dai 7 ai 15 euro,  una vergogna!  Se  per fare i compiti da 10 a 15 al limite ci puoi stare, ma se sono ripetizioni specifiche, come franceseo inglese o altro chiedi almeno 20.    Alcune persone laureate, o anche professori arrivano a chiedere anche 50 euro. (informatica anche)    Poi puoi trattare il prezzo in base alle ore che fai, se ne fai tante magari fagli uno sconto!    Poi  chiaro, se ti occupo di un ragazzino di 8 anni e l'aiuti nei compiti puoi chiedere 10 euro. Dipende dall'intensit della lezione e dal livello richiesto.    7 euro sono remunerazioni da baby-sitter! Non bisogna confondere lo studio con il baby-sitting!!!|`|406a7959d41514c6e3edcec5ca1390c1aa	ciao io frequento la 4 liceo tecnologico e faccio ripetizioni di tutte le materie a bambini delle elementari e ragazzi delle medie per 7 l'ora. A volte mi capita anche di aiutare ragazzi del biennio superiore nelle materie scientifiche.   Nell'annuncio puoi mettere: ragazza diplomata in ... da ripetizioni a bambini e ragazzi e poi scrivi le materie che intendi insegnare. Ciao buona fortuna|`|1OUMgmHVaa	io sono una ragazza che prende ripetizioni!sicch posso dirti un po come funziona:    nelle scuole si attaccano annuncio con il nome dell insegnante e il numero di telefono,se no puoi mettere il tuo annuncio in una cartoleria!!! alcuni hanno uno spazio apposta!!!  La mia insegnante prende 10 ai 18 euro all ora! ma dipende anche dalla materia!!!!nn c' un tariffario preciso!  baci|`|7cf488c294f20b60c5aac1b3a8ade71baa	Personalmente chiedo 7 euro l'ora....sono laureata a pieni voti in economia, ad un passo dalla laurea specialistica...si, potrei chiedere di pi ma il mio scopo non  certo lucrativo bens ai fini dell'insegnamento e quindi son a favore di un prezzo politico ed equo...20 euro l'ora secondo me sono un salasso per i poveri ragazzi (e soprattutto per i loro genitori), soprattutto considerando che le persone che necessitano di ripetizione spesso appartengono a famiglie non ricchissime....|`|aU8EjKzFaa	Per proporti ci sono vari modi: il passaparola, appendere un foglietto con il recapito in cartoleria, recarti all'informagiovani del comune (spesso predispongono delle liste)...  Per il prezzo dipende da chi aiuti e su che argomento, se  un ragazzino delle medie o uno di 5 superiore!  Io al I e II anno di universit seguivo una ragazzina delle medie e chiedevo 8/10 . Prova ad informarti su come  l'andamento dalle tue parti.|`|4lnvWIGWaa	Io l'ho fatto e per tanto tempo. Oggi non  pi secondo me molto usato "prendere ripetizioni" perch comunque le scuole organizzano corsi di ripetizioni gratuiti e fatti dagli stessi insegnanti di ruolo.  Puoi provare con ragazzi con particolari difficolt. E comunque metti annunci (anche su giorenali fa pi "serio") dove spefichi quale materie vuoi insegnare, e che il tuo compenso sar modico.
eB2jK7ywaa	O mio dio....finalmente ho trovato qualcuno con il mio stesso problema. Ogni volta a scuola mi succede la stessa cosa tua: pur essendo una studiosa.doc (forse mi impegno anche troppo) soffro di iper-ansia pre-interrogazione: mi agito, il cuore batte a mille, rispondo male a tutti e mi fa male la pancia. Poi quando vado alla cattedra puff.... tutto sparito ed il bel voto   assicurato. Secondo me per questa  comunque una cosa da superare perch questo stato d'ansia nn  per niente piacevole e magari se non ci fosse potremmo prendere voti ancora migliori. Una curiosit: Non ti danno fastidio le persone che non studiano e poi felici e spensierati vanno alla cattedra con la loro faccetta tosta e magari prendono un voto uguale al tuo se non  migliore ( ovvio che questo non succede molto spesso per..)? Ciaooo|`|dxWwVZDQaa	b penso che sia normale provare un po' di agitazione, prima di una interrogazione! l'importante  che l'ansia non ci impedisca di continuare o di fare un interrogazione decente. comunque prova a fare dei respiri profondi prima che tocchi a te.. non se funziona proprio per l'altra volta una professoressa ha detto di far cos.. ^_^|`|406a7959d41514c6e3edcec5ca1390c1aa	spesso mi capita soprattutto gli attimi prima oppure mentre il prof scorre i nomi sull'elenco. quando invece le interrogazioni sn programmate cerco di uscire per primo perch se resto al baco a ripassare cn un mio compagno, mi vengono dubbi e vado in paranoia, meglio quindi liberarsi di questo perso e uscire prima. ciao|`|nHKBtR7Saa	A tanti succede...Dovresti cercare di tranquillizarti e pensare ke tutto vada bene.

For example, optimisation of the devolatilisation process in pf-fired low-NOx -burners is essential for flame stability as well as formation of NOx from fuel-bound nitrogen. As a result, a better understanding of the devolatilisation process and reaction kinetics is important. Present mathematical models for the devolatilisation process available in CFD codes are crude and thereby limited in scope.    i don't know what exactly it means exept it might have to do with metallurgy.

f67bf2f970cdc18b147c58680eff9190aa	The UN is a tough place to get into. You have to get your foot in the door. I have a friend who worked for the UN. However she was working with a government agency that helped her get her foot in the door. It depends on experience. I myself would like to work for the UN. I believe an internship program or development program is entry level. Also there are language requirements, so having at least two languages behind you will help you.  All in all- check out their website www.un.org and do some research.   If you are still working on your BA, I recommend you to do some internships that help you gain experience. I am sure your Masters program will help you out once you get there....all in all-good luck. I am headed the route too.
WyIKPGmGaa	I think a skill everyone could benefit from universally would be communication.  Just think of all the pros and cons in fully mastering this.  This is a skill used everyday, anywhere you go.  This is something that we learn and develop as children and use until the day we die.

The amount of knowledge available and the efficiency of its distribution was vastly increased with the advent of the written word.    Other choices I can think of: typing, a second (or multiple) language fluency, and being able to play a musical instrument.

1965ccd17c243e92eb8542406ba7f026aa	Non era compito facile, da una figura cos poco romanzesca come quella di un contadino, trarre un personaggio con una sua realt psicologica e umana ben definita. Il rischio di cadere nel generico, e di creare un tipo anzich un vero e proprio personaggio, era grande. Il Manzoni vi ha eluso, concentrando su di esso il suo attento acume per gli umili ed i semplici di cuore.    Renzo  un giovane che, nato e cresciuto nel limitato ambiente del suo paese, conosce la vita solo nei suoi aspetti pi semplici e consueti (che sono poi i fondamentali), la fatica del lavoro e la forza degli affetti: luna affrontata con lentusiasmo e il vigore dei ventanni, laltra intimamente sentita e tutta concentrata su di un unico affetto.    Rimasto solo al mondo in ancor giovane et, egli  abituato a bastare a se stesso, e si  creato, con un onesto lavoro, una certa sicurezza per s e per la sposa prescelta. Nel suo animo onesto ed equilibrato fanno breccia le grazie di una contadina giovane, bella, modesta e laboriosa, ed il suo buon senso e la sua intelligenza gli indicano subito che quella  la donna fatta per lui. Egli concepisce per lei un affetto profondo, intimo, tenace, in cui si concentra tutto il suo bisogno di calore umano, rimasto  fino a quel momento  insoddisfatto. Prova per essa un rispetto che gli viene suggerito, oltre che dalle sue convinzioni morali, anche dal riservato e pudico contegno della fanciulla. E prova pure unombra di gelosia, quando le rimprovera di avergli taciuto linsidia tesale da don Rodrigo: ma si calma subito, di fronte alla candida risposta di Lucia.    Renzo, di indole buona, ha tuttavia un temperamento impetuoso, incline a scatti ed a ribellioni improvvise (un agnello se nessun lo tocca  dice di lui don Abbondio  ma se uno vuol contraddirgli): scatti e ribellioni che per vengono presto e subito si dissipano e si calmano. Si tratta quindi di esuberanza pi che di prepotenza, di vivacit unita ad uningenuit talvolta fanciullesca. Renzo, infine, non  privo di una naturale intelligenza e furberia, che si rivelano particolarmente infallibili nei momenti pi critici.    Finch questo prezioso corredo di elementi pi che positivi lo accompagna nella sua vita consueta, egli dimostra di possedere tutti i numeri per poter destreggiarsi ottimamente. Ma quando ai monti e alle tranquille distese verdeggianti del suo paesello si sostituiscono le grigie mura della citt, alla pace dei campi la vita tumultuosa dei giorni della rivolta di Milano, le sue modeste esperienze si rivelano insufficienti alle mutate condizioni, e i problemi che si presentano non trovano tanto facilmente una soluzione.    Cos egli commette parecchi errori: si mette in vista nel tumulto, e poi, come se non bastasse, tiene una specie di comizio alla presenza di una piccola folla di persone. Egli dice,  vero, delle semplicistiche, ma sacrosante verit, e  in preda alleuforia del momento  trova anche un linguaggio efficace per esprimerle; ma ci  sufficiente a destare i sospetti di un bargello (come allora si chiamavano i poliziotti), che da quel momento gli si mette alle calcagna.    Il povero Renzo non espone gi idee da rivoluzionario, da sovvertitore dellordine pubblico, ma si rivela piuttosto fautore di un giusto ed ordinato assetto sociale; se il bargello non avesse avuto come unica mira quella di accalappiare un qualunque capro espiatorio e, cosa assurda in uno sgherro, si fosse preso la pena di ascoltare e giustamente interpretare le parole del giovane, avrebbe dovuto convenire che il suo discorso non conteneva nulla di sedizioso. Renzo , s, partecipe della generale esaltazione, ed  altres convinto che il popolo abbia ragione e che la carestia sia da imputarsi ai disonesti che occultano la farina per far levitare i prezzi, ma in cuor suo alberga lingenua illusione che a ristabilire lordine e la giustizia sarebbe bastato che dirigenti illuminati della stoffa di Ferrer, interpretassero la volont del popolo, e lo aiutassero a liberarsi dei prepotenti signorotti che ormai costituivano una sorta di Stato nello Stato.    Egli, quindi, non che avversare, si rivela consenziente con i governanti, fautore dellordine e, per natura, contro ogni violenza.    Perci aiuta Ferrer e deplora la turpe condotta del vecchio malvissuto, che avrebbe voluto appendere con le proprie mani il cadavere del Vicario. Allosteria della luna piena, Renzo continua nella serie dei suoi errori: rifiuta di dare il suo nome alloste e  avendo sempre ben presenti i suoi casi personali  si agita pi che mai quando sente parlare di gride.    Cos, ingenuamente, parlando col cuore e rifacendosi ad una reale esperienza, rende sempre pi difficile la sua situazione.    Ma anche qui Renzo, pur avendo bevuto numerosi bicchieri di vino, conserva sempre un certo equilibrio e quasi un istintivo ritegno. I suoi discorsi non sono mai volgari, ma sempre espressione della sua naturale onest e vi  come un istinto che non gli lascia sfuggire il nome della sua Lucia.    Il mattino seguente, quando la presenza di un notaio e degli sgherri lo restituisce alla realt, egli, sgombro ormai dai fumi del vino, si riprende rapidamente e  dopo aver proclamato la propria innocenza  passa alla controffensiva, mettendo in moto quel tanto di prontezza e di furberia che  nativamente in lui.    Riesce cos, sulla strada, valutando dun baleno la situazione, a liberarsi e a sgattaiolare tra la folla. Perch Renzo non pensa al male, ed  anzi incline a giudicare il suo prossimo ottimisticamente, ma quando si accorge di essere vittima di un sopruso, di una prepotenza, si ribella, mettendo in moto tutta la sua intelligenza ed anche quella certaria di braveria, invero pi apparente che sostanziale.

d33658e9f05688cf69f9b7d1b5efb74faa	heat rises,|`|AA11242316	As has been stated already, heat rises. In the winter you want to keep heat inside. In the summer, you want to keep the heat outside. The roof contributes more to the heat gain of the house than the walls do. That's because the sun beats on the roof all day long. The walls are partly or fully shaded for most of the day. Also, the angle of the sun's energy is more direct on the roof than on the walls. This contributes to greater heat gain. The roof/attic is the "thermal weak spot" of a house. Extra insulation protects it.  Foam insulation, fiberglass insulation, and thermal windows (I'm assuming that means double to triple pane) and trap and hold air in place. The two types of insulation hold air in little pockets. The window has an air space between the panes. Air has very low thermal conductance. That means heat doesn't go through it very well. The air is what does the actual insulating. The foam or fiberglass is just there to hold the air pockets stationary.|`|YmjST1wxaa	The attic needs more insulation because of the nature of heat to rise.  The attic is the vertical limit of a house and the last barrier for heat before it goes up into the outside air.|`|7b6dfe25effa5d1dd067f55c35d61913aa	Because heat accumulates in the roof from heating by the sun and heats up your house in summer and escaping through the roof in winter.  Also your AC ducts may be up there (ours are) and without adequate insulation you end up paying a lot more for cooling than you would with better insulation.      The insulations on windows prevent escape and entry of air and thus prevent loss of heat or air.|`|rqUnlT1Jaa	heat rises, therefore it is trying to escape through the attic, it needs to be insulated to keep the whole house heated|`|dGpAITGYaa	I think the other answers have already adequately explained that heat rises, so I'll answer the second part of your question.    The common factor between: foam insulation, fiberglass insulation, and thermal windows is that they all utilize air as a method of prohibiting (or at least greatly slowing) heat transferrence. foam and fiberglass both trap air inside the gaps in their construction. Thermal windows trap air between the pains of glass. Stagnant air changes temperatures MUCH more slowly than the wood and metal around them, and infinitely more slowly than moving air.    Consider a thermos. It works by having a container inside of another container with no insulating material but the air between the containers.
a518c0006e99122343f73c08945009c8aa	qualche dritta interessante a livello concettuale (non ricordo date e sviluppo cronologico ma non  questo che chiedi): nel seicento in italia ed in inghilterra la mentalit scientifica comincia a contrapporsi apertamente alla chiesa, molte scoperte scientifiche contraddicono o sembrano contraddire l'autorit dei testi sacri, nel settecento, l'era della grande rivoluzione borghese, il clero e l'aristocrazia entrano in crisi, queste due classi infatti fondavano la loro autorit sul diritto divino e non sul diritto naturale (giusnaturalismo) che a differenza del primo (assoluto e gerarchico)  uguale per tutti (se leggi Hobbes il monarca leviatano  il frutto di un patto o di un'alleanza o di un contratto -cos' per Rousseau-. che gli uomini sottoscrivono nel'intenzione comune di smettere di farsi la guerra, ma la guerra pu esistere soltanto se le parti in causa sono forze che si equilibrano altrimenti vince il pi forte e pace fatta..). La natura infatti, se studiata scientificamente, non rivela affatto la presenza di un ente privilegiato o di un principio divino che non sia la scienza stessa, la quale non si fonda sull'esperimento ma sulla matematica, che  forse la principale espressione della ragione umana. La matematica per, e cos la scienza, non sono altro che strumenti dell'uomo per la comprensione (comprehensio) e il dominio della materia. Affinch la materia sia conoscibile in s stessa  cos necessario che nessun ente e nessuna creatura, tranne la ragione umana, sia considerato superiore, inferiore, o qualitativamente diverso da ogni altro ente. La matematica platonica e in genere la matematica antica avevano come proprio oggetto non gi il mondo sensibile, ma il mondo delle idee e delle forme, dei numeri e delle figure geometriche. Non era dunque possibile separare quantit e qualit mentre per Locke esistono qualit primarie cio quantit (conoscibili) e qualit secondarie (sensibili) ma l'ultra-sensibilit delle forme ideali  qualcosa che va perso -insieme con la metafisica- durante l'illuminismo. La vecchia immagine di Dio viene sostituita da quella della ragione, il grande architetto o il demiurgo  il simbolo di un Dio che non  pi oltre l'umano ma che  invece l'universalizzazione dell'umano. Attraverso le scienze positive e la matematica la civilt occidentale comincia a far luce su molti aspetti del mondo esteriore che prima risultavano occultati dal senso religioso, per il quale la materia, la natura, l'uomo stesso non sono che l'ultimo grado di manifestazione di una realt che  concepita come interamente trascendente e che va dunque ben oltre l'umano. Per questo non poteva svilupparsi una mentalit scientifica all'interno della chiesa: ha inizio dunque una campagna contro la superstizione e contro la spiritualit volta ad affermare la superiorit della ragione e dell'intelletto sulla metafisica (kant, il trascendente diventa trascendentale). La ragione  universale quanto Dio ma  immanente (non  trascendente): la sua funzione  di esprimere il mondo (quello visibile) in termini matematici per renderlo conoscibile. La conoscenza pu soltanto essere fisica o sperimentale e quindi da ultimo deve trovare il proprio fondamento sulla matematica e su una filosofia che ponga la ragione, e non lo spirito, al centro dell'universo.  La mathesis universale, in tutti i campi (scienza e diritto sopra tutti)  il grande sogno dell'illuminismo..|`|bJStiZaUaa	Gocce di illuminismo in brevi frasi!!!

24d5a97d12f007621e565cd9245fae70aa	Concievably, you have 999 x 99 as your largest possible number in the set.  That equals 98901.  So you're looking for the number closest to that.      It doesn't make sense to put your lowest numbers first in each case, you want to maximize.    Thus, if you put 6 and 9 as the top two digits, then you have to maximize the remaining three spots with 3 numbers.  The two digit number is easy - it will be either 6x or 9x.   The three digit number varies from 6zy, 6yz, 9zy, 9yz.    As a result, you get some of these combinations:  *999x99=98901* highest possible with 3 x 2  134x69=9246  169x34=5746  913x64=58432  613x94=57622  643x91=58513  641x93=59613  631x94=59314  613x94=57622  614x93=57102  634x91=57694  913x64=58432  931x64=59584  934x61=56974  943x61=57523  914x63=57582  941x63=59283  961x43=41323  963x41=39483  964x31=29884  431x96=41376  * highest possible with 4xx & 9x      The answer thus is 641 x 93|`|aab57b336446508e5c8a01c01c4135ceaa	641x93=59,613  Its the largest   you could make.|`|8Np4YVbTaa	641 * 93  59613    I believe..|`|Da7y0J7vaa	9*6*1 multlypy it by 4*3

BHj00VEbaa	Dipende dai prezzi che girano nel posto in cui ti trovi. Ovviamente considera che dovrai prendere meno delle persone gi diplomate. Puoi farlo anche se sei minorenne. Nel mio paese per le elementari alcuni prendono circa 100 euro al mese e aiutano i bambini tutti i giorni. A me sembrano pochi, ma  cos. Del resto devi considerare che qui molte famiglie vivono con un solo stipendio, quello del padre, perch le madri sono casalinghe. I laureati prendono circa 10-15 euro all'ora, non di pi, e questo vale anche con i professori di ruolo che nel pomeriggio danno ripetizioni ad alunni di altre classi. Questi prezzi sono molto bassi rispetto alla media nazionale, almeno da quello che sento in giro.

Io facendo questo metodo dei conti ci ho perso dei gran centoni    - spesso soprattutto ragazzi di medie e superiori ti chiamano all'ultimo momento dicendo che saltano l'ora o si dimenticano proprio di venire (se fai lezione a casa tua) e magari i genitori nn sanno nulla, e te ci perdi tempo e denaro: fatti pagare la lezione persa a prezzo intero o dimezzato se non avvisano in tempo (entro mattinata-mezzogiorno)    - alcuni genitori sono peggio dei figli: magari credi di trovare appoggio e comprensione da loro e invece appoggiano il figlio fannullone... brutto ma ti ci devi abituare.

Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto: io ho imparato sulla mia pelle che se le persone hanno a che fare con dei ragazzi giovani tendono ad approfittarsene in qualche modo, per cui meglio essere previdenti.
7T7P5yaPaa	I never studied this aspect of WWI, but here's my take.  The end of the Russo-Japanese war (1905) "made" Japan a world-power to be reckoned with.  Because of the Japanese threat, Russia had to have a constant force in the East during WWI.  All other nations in East Asia (esp Korea, China, Philippines) were very concerned with Japan, now that it also was a naval power.  With the number of British interests in Asia (especially concerning their trade in India and other countries), they were very concerned with the "new" Japanese threat, which would become a reality in WWII.|`|N5jFoSW6aa	Hey, you dont happen to be in Mrs Hjelmerviks AP World History Class do you??????

I would think being taught by one of the most famous philosophers of all time would have a huge effect on a person.    According to most Western standards, Alexander got the best of the best since Aristotle was Plato's student who in turn was a student of Socrates.|`|LCeegcYGaa	He was his father

NB. your introduction should state your position and your main ideas that will be discussed  your conclusion MUST NOT contain any new material, its merely a wrap-up of your argument.    hope this helps|`|Cn5oCeeSaa	well, it's harder than a normal essay that's for sure. write a normal essay ( hard enough as it is without trying to be argumentative) prove everything, make everything flow. then put attitude into the essay, without coming off as being illogical.    first off list the main points of your argument, ask yourself the question why this point is used in your argument, and what does it have to do with your argument. find examples to back yourself up, explain why, and how it has anything to do with your argument.    conclude with tons of attitude. but DONT make your essay sound illogical at ALL times    good luck, this is all the help I can give.

"government of the people - by the people - for the people".  people tend to remember it better that way.  2) use alliteration, words that start with the same letter, like 'smelly socks sit in sunshine' only dont do that one- its terrible!  3) use metaphors. where you say something IS something; 'my brother IS a pig'. he isnt REALLY a pig, but you're comparing the two.  4) use similes. where you say something is LIKE something else; 'my brother eats like a pig' or 'her eyes were like sapphires'  5) use personification. where you make something seem alive; 'the rays of sunlight LEAPT through the field'. obviously, they didntreally leap, but the act of making them seem alive can help people remember.    i hope this will help you. if you want any more, email me and ill write out some more for you!  good luck! phants x x x

Can you make the longest response?(must be words)?  can anyone make the longest response?  but it must be words.  Words, words words.  Big deal.  I love duckies!  Ducks rock, I love ducks.  And kitties!  I used to have a cat, her name was libby.  Isn't this response soooo random?  I feel like writing about what I have learned about cells in science.  I will make a story on the spot!  Let's see... actually, I don't feel like it.  I will write about MITOSIS instead!  Yeah!  Why am I so happy?  Well, I have to do it for homework anyway, so I will just do a draft right here!    Since the beginning of the life of the first living thing, all organisms, big or small, have had cells.  According to the cell theory, which, in addition to the statement above that says that all living things have cells, it tells us that the cells of multicellular organisms divide.  How?  Single cells go through a phase in their life called mitosis.  Mitosis is like having two balls of dough and pulling both halves in opposite directions, eventually making two new balls of dough.  Mitosis consists of four main phases, quite unlike the dough cells I just talked about.  These four do not include interphase, which is what cells spend most of their lives in.  90% of a cells life is spent in this phase, in which it replicates DNA, prepares for mitosis, and increases in size.  A cell growing in size is vital because, like the balls of dough, the cells will become a bit smaller than they were before.  Hopefully, the cell is ready to undergo mitosis right on time, letting the process go smoothly.   The first phase, PROPHASE, is a preparation stage for the cell.  The protective nuclear membrane of the cell disappears, making the cell a bit vulnerable.  This is why your cells do not go through mitosis all at once, where it is most likely to be damaged.  Centrioles, found only in animal cells, drift apart to take up stations on either side of the cell.  Meanwhile, spindle fibers appear and chromosomes, made out of DNA, appear and find a partner like at a square dance, ready to dance.  As mitosis progresses, the lone animal cell enters METAPHASE, a phase where our dancing chromosomes swing their partners and themselves into the middle, allowing spindle fibers to attach to their backs.   All of a sudden, ANAPHASE takes place, and the chromosome partner dance party comes to a close as the chromosomes pairs are pulled away, the dance floor, or cytoplasm, going with them.  Soon, TELEPHASE, the final stage of mitosis, begins and the cells pull apart completely, revealing two complete, identical new cells.  Spindle fibers go away, pulling the centrioles with them, and soon the chromosomes become DNA again.  Deciding to come back from its short vacation, the nuclear membrane also appears, and in plant cells, a cell wall will soon accompany it.  The party that is mitosis is over, and the two new cells must live through interphase once more.      Yay!  So fun, am I right?  RIGHT?  Right.  Now what?  I know!  No, actually, I don't.  Hey, guess what?  I get straight A's in all honors classes!  Isn't that so cool?  Even though i am only in middle school.... or am I?  No, really, I am in college... or am I?  Actually, I am in preschool, i am just super smart! Not!  I am in Elementary school!  Not!  Then what am I?  High school?  Adult?  Dead?  I'll never tell.  I'm bored.  Are you bored?

wjUi5odnaa	I graduated from the UT and this is how it works:     UT has pre-alloted number of spots for out-of-state and international students.  Depending on the number of applicants for that year in those two categories will determine the difficulty of you getting in.  For example if there's not a lot of out of state students applying your year then you'll have a better chance of admission.      With regards to state status, you should call the school's office of admissions (512-475-7399) and explain to them how your father lives in Texas and therefore you would like to qualify for in-state tuition.  If you father can claim you on his taxes as a dependent then you should qualify (even though you live in Ohio).      Here is the information directly from UT's website:     "An applicant or student who is claimed as a dependent on a parent's most recent federal tax return will be classified based on the parent's qualifications for residency."    http://www.utexas.edu/student/admissions...    Good luck and Hook 'em Horns!|`|ztvLRwl7aa	It's kinda hard to say, but in my experience, i think it is easier. My brother applied there before we moved here from CA and he got in.

d5d8a80808f848cd83d12174318c9e9faa	Read what Belford HS says about their high school diplomas and college entrance at the internet site under Source(s) below.   Other websites indicate Belford is accredited by online accredicting associations.  But not all accrediting is the same.  When on the internet, it's tough to know what to believe and what to doubt.  From my limited review of the internet, the only glowing statements about a Belford HS diploma are on their own website.  As I understand it, the Belford HS diploma is granted based upon life experience.  A somewhat relevant question is whether life experience is of the extent and quality necessary for you to apply to the college or university of your choice.  Maybe a local community college will accept your Belford HS diploma as the basis for enrolling you.  I hope you the best in your continuing education.  You may have an interest in getting trained in a trade at a trade school.|`|tgLRdBS6aa	If the reports are right about the school being fake, you've got 2 issues. First, there was probably some illegal fraud that was pulled on you and your father, so talk to a lawyer or the police about that. Second, you can still probably take an exam and get a GED from your local school district, which will be just as good as a regular high school diploma when applying to college.

Todos estos grandes proyectos a largo plazo fueron organizados y llevados a cabo por el estado, es ecir el faraon en turno.

Hacia el el tercer periodo de la cultura., se habian abandonado la construccion de arquitecturas a gran escala, incluyendo las nuevas piramides que se tenian previstas debido a la  el debilitamiento de dicha cultura, asi como acontecimientos belico que se sucitaron en la epoca .Actualmente es la unica de las siete antiguas maravillas que se encuentra de pie.

SUERTE!|`|lovVcf0kaa	La Revolucin Industrial es definida como un conjunto de transformaciones econmicas y sociales, caractersticas del desarrollo de Inglaterra en el perodo comprendido entre 1750 y 1820 y su correspondiente influencia en todo el continente europeo y si se quiere con sus repercusiones mundiales; es considerada como el mayor cambio socioeconmico y cultural de la historia, ocurrido entre fines del siglo XVIII y principios del XIX, que comenz en el Reino Unido.    En aquel tiempo la economa basada en el trabajo manual fue remplazada por otra dominada por la industria y manufactura de maquinaria. La revolucin comenz con la mecanizacin de las industrias textiles y el desarrollo de los procesos del hierro. La expansin del comercio fue favorecida por la mejora de las rutas de transportes y posteriormente por el nacimiento del ferrocarril. Las innovaciones tecnolgicas ms importantes fueron la mquina de vapor y la denominada Spinning Jenny, una potente mquina relacionada con la industria textil. Estas nuevas mquinas favorecieron enormes incrementos en la capacidad de produccin. La produccin y desarrollo de nuevos modelos de maquinaria en las dos primeras dcadas del siglo XIX facilit la manufactura en otras industrias e increment tambin su produccin.  Causas  Las causas de la revolucin industrial son diversas, de las cuales destacan las causas demogrficas, agrcolas y la mejora de nuevas vas de comunicacin y tecnologas. Algunos historiadores la contemplan como el momento en el que se dejaron atrs los cambios sociales e institucionales surgidos con el fin de la etapa feudal britnica despus de la Guerra Civil Inglesa en el siglo XVII.    En el campo de la agricultura la existencia de controles fronterizos ms intensos evitaron la propagacin de enfermedades y disminuy la propagacin de epidemias como las ocurridas en tiempos anteriores. La revolucin agrcola britnica hizo adems ms eficiente la produccin de alimentos con una menor aportacin del factor trabajo, alentando a la poblacin que no poda encontrar trabajos agrcolas a buscar empleos relacionados con la industria y, por ende, originando un movimiento migratorio desde el campo a las ciudades as como un nuevo desarrollo en las fbricas. La expansin colonial del siglo XVII acompa?ada del desarrollo del comercio internacional, la creacin de mercados financieros y la acumulacin de capital son considerados factores influyentes, como tambin lo fue la revolucin cientfica del siglo XVII. Se puede decir que se produjo en Inglaterra por su desarrollo econmico, poltico y tecnolgico.    La presencia de un mayor mercado domstico debera tambin ser considerada como un catalizador de la revolucin industrial, explicando particularmente por qu ocurri en el Reino Unido.    La invencin de la mquina de vapor fue una de las ms importantes innovaciones de la revolucin industrial. Hizo posible mejoramientos en el trabajo del metal basado en el uso de coque en vez de carbn vegetal. En el siglo XVIII la industria textil aprovech el poder del agua para el funcionamiento de algunas mquinas. Estas industrias se convirtieron en el modelo de organizacin del trabajo humano en las fbricas.    Adems de la innovacin de la maquinaria, la cadena de montaje contribuy mucho en la eficiencia de las fbricas.    Revolucin agrcola: aumento progresivo de la produccin gracias a la inversin de los propietarios en nuevas tcnicas y sistemas de cultivo, adems de la mejora del uso de fertilizantes.   El desarrollo del capital comercial: Las mquinas se aplicaron a los transportes y a la comunicacin iniciando una enorme transformacin. Ahora las relaciones entre patronos y trabajadores es nicamente laboral y con el fin de obtener beneficios.   Cambios demogrfico-sociales: la modernizacin de la agricultura permiti un crecimiento demogrfico debido a la mejora de la alimentacin. Tambin hubo adelantos en la medicina y en la higiene, de ah que creciera la poblacin. Tambin hubo una emigracin del campo a la ciudad porque la ocupacin en labores agrcolas disminuy mientras creca la demanda de trabajo en las ciudades.   Esta primera revolucin se caracteriz por un cambio en los instrumentos de trabajo de tipo artesanal por la mquina de vapor, movida por la energa del carbn. La mquina exige individuos ms calificados, produce una reduccin en el nmero de personas empleadas, arrojando de manera incesante masas de obreros de un ramo de la produccin a otra, especialmente del campo a la ciudad.    La revolucin industrial gener tambin un ensanchamiento de los mercados extranjeros y una nueva divisin internacional del trabajo' (DIT). Los nuevos mercados se conquistaron mediante el abaratamiento de los productos hechos con la mquina, por los nuevos sistemas de transporte y la apertura de vas de comunicacin, as como tambin, mediante una poltica expansionista. El Reino Unido fue el primero que llev a cabo toda una serie de transformaciones que la colocaron a la cabeza de todos los pases del mundo. Los cambios en la agricultura, en la poblacin, en los transportes, en la tecnologa y en las industrias, favorecieron un desarrollo industrial. La industria textil algodonera fue el sector lder de la industrializacin y la base de la acumulacin de capital que abrir paso, en una segunda fase, a la siderurgia y al ferrocarril.    A mediados del siglo XIX, la industria britnica tena slidas bases y con una doble expansin: las industrias de bienes de produccin y de bienes de consumo. Incluso se estimul el crecimiento de la minera del carbn y de la siderurgia con la construccin del ferrocarril. As, en Gran Breta?a se desarroll de pleno el capitalismo industrial, lo que explica su supremaca|`|7RknEpyoaa	wevon, ponte a leer, asi no vas a aprender nada y solo seras un idiota bueno para nada con titulo.|`|Hve0goDqaa	visita esta pagina es excelente... http://www.portalplanetasedna.com.ar/rev...    espero te sirva... un saludo        www.sinmasjefe.ws

La inexistencia de un derecho internacional reconocido por todas las naciones consitua un gran obstculo para imputar delitos a los polticos desde instancias ajenas a la soberana de su estado. Sus acciones estaban solo sometidas al ordenamiento jurdico de su pas y el poltico era nicamente responsable ante los tribunales de este. Los polticos nazis, pues, solo podran ser juzgados por los tribunales alemanes.         Las noticias de las atrocidades que estaban cometiendo los alemanes durante la guerra y la conviccin de que el gobierno nazi haba provocado deliberadamente la contienda favorecieron desde principios de 1941 el desarollo de la idea de someter a un juicio internacional a los dirigentes del nazismo.         Wiston Churchill fue quien primero habl de crmenes de guerra y de la necesidad de que "el castigo por estos crmenes debiera tener lugar cuando se produjera el desenlace definitivo de la contienda".         En 1942 se cre una comisin con el fin de ir elaborando una lista de responsables que deban ser juzgados cuando terminase el conflicto.         En 1945, en la conferencia de Yalta, Stalin, Churchill y Roosevelt trataron tambin este tema, analizaron un amplio documento elaborado en Estados Unidos y establecieron las bases para llegar a un convenio entre los aliados sobre la forma en que el juicio debera celebrarse.         Finalmente, el 8 de agosto de 1945, cuando ya se haba acabado la guerra, se firm en Londres el acuerdo entre los 26 paises que haban intervenido en ella contra Alemania por el que se decidi la creacin de un Tribunal Internacional Militar       JUICIO A CRIMINALES DE GUERRA           Este proceso comienza con una sesin preliminar en Berln, el 18 de octubre de 1945, presidida por el juez militar ruso Nikitchenko. Pero el proceso como tal en contra los principales culpables de crmenes contra la paz, de crmenes de guerra y de crmenes contra la humanidad se celebr entre el 20 de noviembre de 1945 y el 1 de octubre de 1946 en el Palacio de Justicia de la ciudad de Nuremberg. Lamentablemente muy pocos responsables de la barbarie alemana fueron juzgados e incluso muchos jerarcas nazis lograron evitar ser atrapados. A Nuremberg llegaron las caras ms conocidas del III Reich, al menos, aquellas personas que an seguan vivas al momento de celebrarse el proceso. Himmler, Goebbels y el propio Hitler se haban suicidado para evitar ser juzgados; solo G?ring lleg vivo a Nuremberg en su condicin de gran jerarca nazi.          Se escogi la ciudad de Nuremberg por una cuestin prctica: en Berln no haba quedado en pie ningn edificio que pudiera albergar un procedimiento judicial de estas caractersticas, pero Nuremberg posea un palacio de justicia con una sala capaz para 600 personas, contiguo a un gran centro penitenciario en el que se poda recluir a los detenidos y con un acceso a la sala, que, por una parte, evitaba todo contacto no deseado de los dirigentes nazis, y por otra, haca completamente seguros los traslados de los presos desde las celdas al tribunal.         Nuremberg ofreca adems, un aliciente a?adido: haba sido la sede de las grandes manifestaciones; all haban desplegado todos sus smbolos y banderas aclamadas por multitudes, y all se haba aprobado las leyes ms racistas del III Reich. El ingrediente simblico tambin era importante.|`|c5bc8b2efde46e5a550847a27ab9ccf7aa	Leyes de Nremberg     Grfico publicado por el gobierno Nazi en 1935, explicando los esquemas familiares que determinaban la limpieza de sangreLas Leyes de Nremberg (Nrnberger Gesetze en alemn) fueron unas leyes de carcter antisemita en la Alemania nazi adoptadas por unanimidad el 15 de septiembre de 1935 durante el sptimo Reichsparteitag (congreso anual del NSDAP) celebrado en la ciudad de Nremberg, Alemania.       Especificaciones  [editar]En funcin del origen de los cuatro abuelos que tiene un individuo, se le otorgaba la distincin "alemn" (cuatro abuelos alemanes), "judo" (cuatro abuelos judos) o "mestizo" si se descenda de uno o dos judos. El judasmo de un individuo vena determinado por la religin que profesasen su padres.    Estas leyes otorgaron una base legal a la ideologa antisemita de los nazis.    Uno de los dos cuerpos de leyes era conocido como "Ley para la proteccin de la sangre y el honor alemanes". Su principal disposicin consista en la prohibicin de toda unin entre alemanes y judos, ya sea por matrimonio, cohabitacin o relacin sexual.    El otro cuerpo de ley, conocido como "Ley de la ciudadana del Reich", estableca una divisin entre alemanes y judos, al consagrar a los primeros como "ciudadanos del Reich" y reducir a los segundos a la categora de "nacionales".

Normally, they do this a few times when school starts, and its ALWAYS for the benefit and around the parents.|`|nMSV2kcVaa	Spank Em' in fronta the parents.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Distract he w/her favorite classroom toy  Have the assistant read a book to her  Have crying child be a "teacher helper"    Have the parent leave quickly/ reassure the parent the child will be okay  Maybe update the parent midday on the status of the child/reassure parent again|`|RVABrMeSaa	try enlisting the help of another student. if the cryer is distracted they will stop and join the class. the parent can then leave.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	explain to the parents that they must do a 'drop and run'.  they need to say all their goodbyes before they get to the classroom and explain to little gomer that they'll be back.  once they enter the classroom, it's 'i love you and i'll be back later'.  kiss and leave.  they can stay in the director's office or anywhere out of sight to listen for reassurance but they can not re-enter the room or let the child see them.  they need to understand that they are the cause of gomer's problem.  they need to be strong for him.    also, suggest to the parents that they might let little gomer bring a treat to share with the class.  this can be a bag of apples, a box of crackers, a coloring book, whatever little gomer gets to pick out.  it will give him something to look forward to.  and let him do it until he's comfortable coming to school alone.    also, get him interested in things as soon as he enters the door.  have stations set up for the kids at arrival time.  a table of play dough, a table of puzzles, a table of games, etc.  that way he can join in immediately.  or even announce that 'little gomer is here, we can open the play dough table now'.    every child wants and needs to feel special and every parent wants to know that the teacher feels their child is special.  that is the part of customer service that most teachers don't get.  we are also here to educate and raise the parents as well as the children.    good luck with little gomer (and parents)|`|i5tOQGgFaa	To be truthful...it's actually easier when they come alone off the bus.  :-)  LIke the others have mentioned...having the parent there can cause a little more problems.  Number one is to show empathy.  I would prefer to hear a teacher saying to a student... "Coming to school was hard today." Instead of saying, It's okay...you're going to have fun and so on.  It might not be okay...we don't know.  Usually it works to give them a hug...show some empathy and get them interested in an activity...preferably sensory, stay near them for awhile and then slowly move away.  Sometimes reading a book with the child allows for them time to get their emotions under control.    As for parents, I find it's a good thing to discuss this with the parents prior to the first day.  That it is benefitial to have short and sweet good-byes.  Reassure them that some children do have difficulty with this transition but most join the group soon after parent leaves.  I've known some parents who are having a harder time than the child.  One of the things I've seen done was getting a digital picture of the child engrossed in something and having fun during that first day and printing it off for the parent at arrival.  Does not have to be a high quality colored picture but just something to show the parent that, yes, my child did have fun today.  Showing empathy to the parent works just as well as showing empathy to the child.  I have a youngster now who "puts on the show" at drop off and pick up and as soon as the parent shuts the door he's all smiles and so on.  But up until then he clings, bangs on the door, cries.  He's such a lovable stinker.  When mom comes he doesn't want to leave and throws a fit and so on.  I've made it clear to the mother how it is so she has learned, as hard as it is, to just smile, give him a hug, say I love you and walk out the door and let me handle him.  :-)  Encourage the parent to have a "good-bye" routine.|`|3UZy2gE2aa	I have taught preschool and kindergarten for over 20 years and there are always children who come in clinging to mom and crying.  You need to get mom out of the classroom as quickly as possible.  Short sweet good byes are the best.  Tell the mom that she is welcome to stay out in the hall out of sight until the crying stops or she can call the school to check on things.  You have to take her feelings into consideration because she is probably ready to cry, too.  Usually once you get rid of the parent you can get the child interested in something and they will stop crying.  It may take awhile for the first few times, but each time will get shorter.  As for the child who comes on the bus, it is actually easier since there is no parent there.  Just get him interested in an activity.  sometimes just ignoring it and letting him go off and find something works well too.|`|hMkSEBAdaa	Try to comfort the child and tell her other things about what she will learn at school. Tell the child that she will still go home later after class. Play with her for a while.|`|8wyMjJW9aa	Can you imagine going into a strange room with strange people and not being upset? Try having a picture class schedule. If you start with circle time, have a picture of children in circle time, then free play, then snack or whtever your schedule is. Then you can say to the child "First we are going to have a meeting, then we are going to have time to play etc all the way up to the time to go home. As the day progresses you can remove the pictures of what has already happened and just leave the ones to come.  I hve also found that having an early snack  helps the child to feel better.  As  for the Mom, tell her to say goodbye, one last kiss and then go. Give mom the phone number and tell her to call back in an hour. Also, keep copies of "The Kissing Hand" handy. Reassures Mom that she is not going through anything other parents face.|`|ecFz0aUraa	I agree with the others when they say have the parent drop them off and leave right away.  The child may cry for a few minutes, but then they will see all the stuff they are going to get to do and they will be fine. Talk with the parents. Assure them that it's in the best intrest of the child to do it that way.  My son did it for a few days, and now he races me into daycare to see if he can beat me in there.|`|0ca2b53ccf7bfa29bcf1d35de2c42092aa	You cuddle them!  Assure the parent that the child will be fine in their absence, and reassure the child that they will do plenty of activities while they are in your care.  Try to get the child interested in an activity as soon as they calm down a little.  Remind the child throughout the day that parents come back after lunch (or whenever they do come), or that the child will be going back on the bus.  You want the child to be as aware as possible of what is going to happen all day, so make sure to tell them of what is coming up.  The scariest part of a new situation is not knowing what is coming, so prewarning a child of a change is critical.  Crying is typical of children in a new situation, and the first day (or week) of school is a pretty typical place to see that behavior.  Reassurance and consistency will help the child learn to trust the new situation and you.
i5tOQGgFaa	I find that most children pick it easier and quicker when we incorporate it multiple time through the day with activities that are meaningful.    As you are folding towels together, count out loud.  Really...don't make her count with you if it is a stress point...because it will still become engrained (usually) just by hearing it over and over.    Setting the table...how many spoons do we need?  How many napkins?    If she is drawing a picture and has multiple of the same objects.  Count them.  "Look, I see 1-2-3-4-5 clouds".    You mentioned count in your main question but then said your sister has trouble recognizing the numbers.  Counting-orally and number recognition are really two different things.  :-)  Does she have trouble with both?    If she likes to be active...consider a number obstacle course in the living room or outside.  Have a number card near by each area and she needs to do that activity that many times.  Like jumping on the pillow 5 times.    Hokey Pokey- number flash cards on the floor.  Put your number 10 in, take your number 10 out.    Put number cards up above her head on a wall.  Provide a fly swatter (decorate it if you want) and have her jump up and slap a number and tell you what it is.  Then perform an action that many times.    Oral counting: Bounce or roll a ball back and forth and count.    Try getting Jump Start or Reader rabbit cd's from the local library at a preschool level.  What I like about these is that it starts at level 1...but automatically moves ahead when that level is mastered.  They really don't know much of a difference and can't change the level like my son likes to do.  (He's 5 and very capable, but he likes to play the games I have out for the babies and toddlers LOL)    Speech strength:  This age usually likes to tell stories.  Draw a picture or have her draw a picture and tell a story about it.  We call this dictation.  You can write it down on another sheet of paper or beneath the pictures.  Encourage her to incorporate numbers.  Call them number stories.    Make a number display/collage.  Each day provide a different block shaped number.  Have her create a collage on it.  Even more "learning" by only putting on that number of objects.  For example...a number 2 might have 2 pasta noodles, 2 buttons, 2 foam shapes, etc.  Display them in her bedroom at her level.    Mystery Numbers:  On half index cards, use white crayons to write one numeral on each card.  Then give her  water colors and the card.  When she paints over the card the numeral will show through it.  As an extension you can use white crayon on another set of cards and create dots to correspond.  Then she can match them, you guys can play memory, etc.    Outside: create a hopscotch board..have her yell the numbers as loud as she can as she hops.  You can also make a "phone pad" with chalk outside and have her jump to the numbers in her telephone.      Number books from your local library- 5 little monkeys is always a favorite.  It's fun to act out.  7 Little Hippos, 5 Little Pumpkins, etc.    Have her draw line pictures.  And then measure each line with a ruler.  If you use a plastic ruler you can use a washable marker or dry erase marker and underline the number and she can state what it is.    Good luck...hope one of those ideas help!|`|dNw5l68Iaa	make a game with grapes or something, cheerios... anything you can give her without it being dangerous.    make her count to 10 or something with grapes, and whens he does it right, she gets to eat em. :)|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Use every situation you can as an opportunity to count   Play hop Scotch  call out a number/letters and have her jump do that number/letter  Have her write numbers/letters outside w/ chalk and say hop to five or skip to letter A  Read number/letters books  Have an ice cube tray and  write numbers in each compartment and have her put that many object in each compartment  Play I spy w/ numbers/treasure hunt w/ numbers  Make number/ alphabet books/ focus on a number letters a  a day cut out pictures from a  from a catalogs  Make letters w/play doh  Incorperate art  c for cookie make cookies from construction paper  Sing letter and number songs (songsforteaching)  Go to preschoolexpress.com they have good ideas  Starfall.com---------great site    Use all the senses to make her understand and make it fun and very hands on|`|Hlrs3aElaa	Don't just use the computer. Use Barbies, m&m's, her favorite toys, or old school way, use apples. some kids need to feel things to learn & count w/ her so she can also hear what numbers they are.  I had a very hard time with learning numbers and letters at that age too. Don't worry, I takes, you guessed it, TIME!|`|MZiHcI9gaa	Don't pressure her.  Make it a game and work within the time frame of her attention span.  Make visuals that you spell the word three write a number 3 and make three stars and so on up to ten.

HcA7k9ZHaa	They learn all of the good things that are posted. BUT they also learn all of the other students bad habits, language, ect. And if you get a teacher that is just there for the pay check your child could actually fall behind even if they attend everyday. They can be bullied if they aren't in the click. Most half day programs at least back when our district still had one you have to pick up from or drive your child to school. They only had bussing one way.  So everything has a good side and a bad. Educating our children is one of the most important things we have to do as a parent. Remember if you aren't ready or your child isn't ready children in PA don't have to legally attend school until they are 8. I homeschool my children now.

H9PbwT8haa	You might try www.lessonplanspage.com. If you search I am sure you will find something.    As the previous response said to talk to the children about "how would they feel if so-and-so crumbled their paper" Not a good idea, I am a child development minor and we are told to never do that. Children interpret that differently than adults do. We hear that and we think, "oh yeah I should think of other people" whereas chlidren are egocentric and only think, "why do I care, it didn't happen to me in real life"    |`|wMzCuPoUaa	A parachute game  Pass the bean bag type of games|`|351ab1780b64a03e2d34f1ccbbbdd38caa	you can ask them questions to get them thinking about how others feel. For example, ask Jacob to tell you how he thinks Michael would feel if he wrinkled up his paper, etc.   You can also do build a structure out of blocks as a group one person at a time. Each person takes a turn to add a block wherever they want, but can't knock anyone else's down.  
bVNCfoykaa	Activity 1: Learning to compare  Collect bottles of various heights, and have the children work as a team to put them in order from tallest to shortest.  Learning to visually compare size is an important foundation for learning adding, subtracting, fractions, reading charts/graphs, and other important maths skills later on.  You could use boxes, toys, blocks, or whatever you think would engage the childrens' interest, and order them in size, quantity, etc.      Activity 2: Learning the written form of Numbers  Trace a large number on colored paper, and cut it out.  Next, cut the number into 2 or 3 pieces, to make it into a kind of simple puzzle.  Have the children fit the pieces together and glue it on a blank sheet of paper, to form the number.  Doing this activity, the kids can learn the general shape of the written form of numbers 0-9.  You can use a different color for each number to make it fun.  It also helps if you discuss the number forms before you do the puzzles, and for beginners, leave up samples of completed numbers, so they can use it as a reference point.      Activity 3: Learning names of Numbers  Young kids at that age, learn best through songs and stories.  They don't need to know how to read, as long as you are engaging them and spark their interest.  Fun stories that feature characters with numbers for names, or counting songs that repeat the names of the numbers over and over again are good places to start when coming up with ideas.  Remember to include visual support such as pictures or hand-movements with your stories and songs, as young children love to use as many of their senses as possible.      Activity 4: Using math in everyday living  Math is something that you get better at with practice.  Have volunteers regularly help you pass out crayons, papers, milk, carrots or whatever it is, and instruct them the pass out a specific number of items for each person.  This will help them interact and use their basic math and counting skills in a practical setting.  Some kids learn better by doing, rather than by being "instructed" in a formal setting.      Activity 5: Creative Math  Using math, but not letting it be the focus, can be a fun activity.  Once your kids and visually recognize the written forms of numbers, have them do coloring pages that are coded with numbers.  For example, all the 1's can equal blue, and all the 2's can equal red, etc.      Good luck!|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Sorting buttons by colors in sorting trays  Graphing How many boys or girls in the class   Have children count how many letters in their name and see who has the longest or shortest name  Have a clothes line and match sock w/ the same patterns  Have them make a pattern w/ objects i.e. buttons,foam shape etc  Have the students  cut picture in magazine of things that  come in pairs and make a collage  Measure objects around the room using non standard measurement i.e.e sting find something in the class longer or shorter than the string  Make a pattern w/bodies i,e one student sitting one student standing etc boy,girl,boy girl  Hide numbers around the room and have the students find it and put the numbers in order  Number bingo|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	Check the classroom ideas section.

Second, you can try to teach her how to write the alphabet if she doesn't know already. If she does, teach her the sounds of the letters. Write it for her often and make sure she sees it. Maybe you could guide her hand as she holds a pen or pencil.    To make it easier, does she have a nickname? If so, does she go by this at school? Then maybe you could teach her to write the nickname instead, and when she learns that, then she can learn to write her real name.|`|ziZQWxi3aa	mrorow whatever your name is; she said sister; so you need to learn how to read!!!  And also, if it was her child she is allowed to give her child whatever name she wants!      First she needs to be able to spell her name out loud!  so have her practice all the letters of the alphabet; if she doesn't know the name of the letters; she isn't going to know how to spell her name or write it because she doesn't know what it looks like.  If you were to write her name down and someone elses name would she know which says her name?  If so, that's a start; she's able to recognize her name!      First get her to recognize all the letters able to name them.  Don't teach her the letters in order but randomly.  Good step by doing the dotted letters.  You can get generated printouts of her name too in dots!  Kindeergarten is much harder these days my son is now in 1st grade.  He had to learn how to read, spell, know geometric shapes, site words; teach your sister site words; that is very important!  It's not too late; it takes time!

Just have her practice writing the alphabet (try writing paper with dotted alphabet so she can trace over it) That way she'll learn her letters and she'll be able to write the alphabet. |`|1JMvQoAqaa	First, instead of focusing just on writing it, help her learn the letters that are in her name.  Make letter cards (index cards cut in half, squares printed off the computer, etc.)  Use just the letters in her name.  Help her put those letters in order to spell her name, then mix them up and fix them.  Keep practicing at this until she knows how to spell her name and identify the letters within it.  Next, start writing one letter at a time.  Work on the L until she know how to write it.  Then add the u . . . continue until she knows her entire name.  You can keep those letter cards out and have her arrange them to spell her name then copy it onto paper.  Tracing is also a good idea...keep working she'll get it!  I still have a few in my class that can't write their name and we work on it this way a lot!|`|4yQUgaeIaa	Show them each letter then ask them to rewrite it.

U5EecLi1aa	Go for JOLLY PHONICS.    Each sound has an action - starting with s,a,t,i,p,n    sound S is hissing snake sound, 'a' is 'a'ngry 'a'nts walking on your arm, 't' is 't'ennis    I teach Jolly Phonics, it's amazing.    I make flashcards of all the sounds, and my students have to identify the first, second, and third sounds in words as well as spell them out.  Thanks to Zoe for rephrasing - the first book is s,a,t,i,p,n  - c/k the castanets don't come until the second book.    With Jolly Phonics, the BIG BOOK has a really big amazing picture book, you spend your 'circle time' talking about it.    The whole point of it is not so much to read them stories, though there are story books. You need to study by watching the DVD to ensure your methodology is sound (and avoid confusion).    This guy is only teaching his own child, so he won't do Circle time - though he can get the Big Books and Workbooks and make simple soundcards (s - snake sun spider, a, - ant, apple,arrow  t, i, p, n - then c,k, e,h,r,m,d - then g,o,u,l,f,b for the first three books) to play games with them.    I taught one boy one-2-one for a month, and he started not knowing ANY alphablet letter sounds - he is Thai.

Tunes such as "Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush", "Twinkle Twinkle", "Row Row Row Your Boat", and other very simple children's songs lend themselves in making easy individualized songs for the children.    Another little side note:  Teaching simple phrases in sign language makes a big difference as well because then you do not have to raise your voice to be heard...especially if you are trying to get an attention of a child across the room.|`|q2p1gZdJaa	Talk quietly your self.

tUfUjGdlaa	Yes-pretty much all of them!    It's a huge stage they go through for a long time in early years (look up Piaget and possibly Bowlby as he researched a lot of this)...    What did I do?  Practice makes perfect!!! Chidlren need to experience social development and learn empathy so its all about giving them experiences and time to learn...also its natural development so you cant push it too much!    Ideas:  -Stories: in a small group discuss the story eg: how does character feel, have you felt like that, what can she do? This will support empathy and recognising others have feelings and emotions.  -Visual rule board: showing rules such as do not snatch toys, share at preschool etc...by having a visual to prompt them they learn what is acceptable in society eg: just because they want the toy doesnt mean they can snatch it!  -Group games: Playing simple turn taking games, small group songs, walk abouts etc so they get used to sharing adult, waiting for things etc    |`|XIsdjeNOaa	All children in preschool are egocentric by the very nature of their age!  Egocentrism is a natural stage that every child goes through, and there is really not a way to make a child understand.  You can work on helping a child learn to recognize and understand the feelings of others, but you can not get then to stop being egocentric.  They should grow out of that stage on their own.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	They are VERY egocentric    Try  having the child  be empathetic  to the other children. Ask the children How would you feel if it happened to you? If the child breaks something another child building have the child who broke it help fix it.  Do a lot of sharing activities in small group  Compliment children who are doing a good job.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Young children ARE egocentric.

Small, inexpensive paint set or water color, bottle of play-dough, small toys, coloring book, crayons, box of markers, homemade foam snowman frame...     Soap set, basket with coffee and chocolate, cans of nuts with chocolate, inexpensive decorations from dollar tree(like the cube with a picture inside or a light up animal but forgot what it was called), book,  movie, bath set, candle, manicure set, those already framed pictures of dollar tree....|`|wMzCuPoUaa	For the kids maybe a new game or toy for the classroom  or books if you want to give something individually    For the rest of the staff make cookies or something else they might enjoy and put it in the staff lounge        For the boss maybe a gift card to her favorite restaurant|`|1a6a009f525618df7a7b7c68ce2da61eaa	You don't need to buy for the other workers, unless you want to. The boss is higher than you, though, so you should probably give him/her a gift.     A nice coffee mug and a package of coffee or tea from Starbucks would probably be sufficient. Or if they're more of a chocolate person, pick up a box of Choxie chocolate from Target. They have these chocolates that have little colored designs on the top-they look like they should be more expensive-I think its about $15 a box.    You could also get her something kind of cute and and unique, if she's a more "out-there" kind of boss. I included all of the products in the sources list:  Lego ice cube mold   Charlie Brown themed hot chocolate and Snoopy mug   Egglings-plants that hatch from eggs   An inexpensive bird feeder and bird feed    For the kids at your preschool, I recommend getting them each one of those cheap clay pots and a couple of packets of seeds. Seeds should still be available at any garden store throughout the year. Attach a poem about seeds or flowers that the parents can read to their kids.          |`|t4VN2JVmaa	I love buying the Bath and Body Works lotions when they're buy 3 get one free. Great deal. Then 'ta-da' you have 4 individual not too expensive but very nice gifts to give out for Christmas.     As for the children, I like to get celophane bags, go to the Dollar Store and pick out Chrismtas themed gifts, candy... remember, it has to fit in the bag!     I would only buy for your boss, and then for one or two of your good friends. It does't make sense to blow your paycheck on gifts to your office. If you gift your boss a gift you could make cookies and leave in the breakroom for everyone else - attach a note from you wishing everyone a Merry Christmas.     These are just my thoughts and what I've done in the past. I plan early too for Christmas. Already got my Christmas card list ready to go! Good luck, I hope you find what works for you.|`|HPYvwlfVaa	im just going to give you short answers sorry if it doesn't help a lot     boss - a book they like or a dvd,cd that they like   kids (easy) - sweets or teddy     i wold also give one to  the workers but that's me you don't have to   workers  - chocolate or a bit of Cheap jewellery (not to much money)|`|yj3vulGmaa	Cute stuffed animals are great for children and are inexpensive if you look at the right place. Possibly Wal-Mart or Target. I don't think you should buy for the other workers, but if you feel bad for not getting one you could buy inexpensive coffee cups and some coffee mix. For your boss, if she/he has a hobby, you could buy accordingly. Otherwise, you could buy he she movie passes, tim horton's coupons, if your boss is a female you could buy her bath products, if male you could buy him liquor (if allowed).|`|8zgzp4U7aa	well it really depends on how much you want to spend. i have no idea about wat to get the children, but if your boss is a woman, then a nice bath set kinda thing would be nice. the ones they have at sears are pretty nice. not that expensive either. |`|T4LxBymBaa	you should give her money.
KAqg13soaa	OH MY GOSH, ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS... it's a phase that some kids go through... Sorry to say this but you seem like a weak parent if your letting her crying get to you... Heres what you do...     1. ask the teacher if she notices anything going on in the classroom that might be upseting her.  2. ask the teacher if she only does this when you drop her off, and if she is fine and playing afterwards.  3.If all is fine with those 2 questions, then keep reminding her that YOU WILL BE THERE WHEN SHE GETS OUT!  4.Talk to her on the way to school, tell her you want her to do something for you weather it be drinking her milk at lunch for you so she can tell you how good it was or anything else she might like to do at school.   5 when you drop her off at school, walk her to the door and say your I love yous before you even get to the door. the longer you are there the more she is ganna want you to stay with her  6. Don't BABY HER!!! she ain't no baby she's 4 and in school... tell her look there is your classroom if she is crying tell her I know your crying or kicking or whatever fit she might be throughing and say YOU NEED TO STAY HERE open the classroom door, make eye contact with the teacher so the teacher CAN GET HER, THAT IS THEIR JOB!!! THEN LEAVE!!! DON'T LOOK BACK AND DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE HER AT ALL... SHE'LL GET OVER IT!!!!  YOUR THE PARENT NOT HER, IF YOU KEEP ACKNOWLEDGING HER WHEN SHE THROWS FITS LIKE THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE ONE SPOILED BRAT AND IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR HER IN THE REAL WORLD!!! REMEMBER THINGS AIN'T LIKE THEY USED TO BE WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP!!!     SORRY TO PUT IT STRAIGHT OUT LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN NOW WHILE THEY ARE YOUNG THEY ARE GOING TO RUN ALL OVER YOU THE REST OF THEIR LIFES!!!  |`|wMzCuPoUaa	Of course talk to the teacher/maybe someone one is picking on her  Set a routine up w/ your child before you say goodbye and adhere to it   Maybe give her an object of yours, so when she feels sad she can get it out  Have a family picture in her backpack  Usually kids stop crying right after the parents leave  Give her a sticker every time she does not cry and maybe reward her and gradually stop giving the sticker|`|i5tOQGgFaa	You've had some good responses.    I agree that you should probably check with the teacher and see if anything different is happening...new teacher/aide...changing of schedule...some "friends" being typical 4 year olds and starting to do the "you're not my friend" routine.  You may wish to take a day or two and observe yourself.    I also agree that if she is happy when you pick her up (or whomever picks her up) then there really isn't much to be concerned about.  It may be as simple as she's observed another child do something similar and she's going to test you the same way.  I would recommend a love you/good-bye ritual that you use every morning.    Another thought...how is the morning at home going?  Is she getting enough sleep?  Are you having to wake her up and "rush" her through breakfast and such?  That makes a HUGE difference.     Something else to ponder...if you give in to her now and keep her home (unless there is something really wrong) she's going to do this again next year and that's Kindergarten and it's not an option.  Think seriously about that.  It's good to start the attitude that school is their "work"/responsibility just like Daddy and Mommy need to go to work.      Good luck!  It pulls on our heart strings, doesn't it?!|`|ib2BLbDTaa	Have you tried asking her what is wrong and if anything happened to her to not like her school anymore.  If she is having attachment issues, which it sounds like, ask the teacher if you can sit in to observe or help out. (if you have the time that is)  This might make her feel alittle more comfortable there just don't do it all the time, and when you leave don't let her know you are leaving do it when she is distracted.  Good luck!!|`|9f363935da83a04ad649588218c4b33caa	I think you need to talk to the teachers and your daughter and see if there is something specific that's bothering her. Ask the teachers how she is during the day. If nothing's wrong, you need to just let her there and walk away. I know it's difficult, but chances are your daughter is happy and playing five minutes after you leave. My son used to cry every day when I dropped him off at preschool, and when I talked to the teachers, I found out it usually didn't last very long. He spend the rest of the day happy.|`|S4y7V4diaa	That sounds troubiling. Maybe someone is hurting her since this just started. You should check things out.|`|1IUD17ufaa	She will get used to it, the friends she will make will help to. Tell her it will be ok.|`|UbzL0zauaa	Kids go through different transitional phases and this could just be one of those, but . . . if she is still upset when you pick her up, I would be concerned and look into things further.  If she is happy when you pick her up then I wouldn't worry to much.  I think the best way to handle her when dropping her off is to give her a hug, tell her you love her and you will be back to pick her up.  Leave right after saying your goodbye and keep this routine consistent so she understands what is going to happen next.  It is hard when this happens, but you will both get through it.|`|On7szKAVaa	First ask your child and the teacher to make sure nothing is going on. If not I would suggest, on the ride to school use the time to talk about how much fun she will have all the friends she will make and if you know ahead of time a certain thing she will be doing that day, tell her " Oh guess what, you will making/ learning about so and so, that sounds like so much fun, mommy can't wait to hear about it this afternoon. Maybe if she is having a really hard time let her take a picture of you and her or the family and tell and the teacher any time she feels like she misses you she can look at it. IN the morning the best way to let go is say a quick Bye , kiss, hug and I love you and go. At first it will be hard for you and her, but it will get better. Also tell the teacher you will be calling through out the day to check in and to let you know how it is going. Don't let her see or act anxious around her she can sense that and it will only make it harder on both. Good luck. |`|lqAA51Kuaa	What triggered this whole crying thing?  You said it just started this week.  Maybe something is scaring her or someone is picking on her.  I know it's only pre-k, but I remember kids picking on me in pre-k.  Something must have happened.  Figure that out and see if you can help her|`|RWJnf0chaa	The children who have the delayed response to preschool with the clinging and crying are the hardest to break and the hardest to figure out. I have taught preschool for almost 20 years.  How is she when you pick her up? Is she happy as a clam?  Does the teacher say it doesn't last after you are gone?  Staying and prolonging the good byes is the worst thing you can do -it only prolongs her agony with her thinking it's working, you are staying so she will keep crying - also staying to observe the class.  a no-no and not much help for the rest of the class or your daughter.   Trust the teachers to do their jobs - allow them to take your child and snuggle her and you make a quick exit. This is your daughter's job just like your work is your job.  We had a tough case this year with a delayed reaction just like your daughter - she worked to earn a sheet of stickers with no fussing and it took a week, but she finally earned it and now she comes in all smiles.  No more stickers, just big smiles from her teachers - they are growing up and asserting their boundaries.  Good luck!
UOmhBNxKaa	'why do you want to work with kids?'  'are you ready to be a role model?'  'what specifically do you like to do with kids?'  'what part of working with kids do you not like?'  'how are you going to deal with an upst parent?'  'what is your idea of classroom management?'  'how would you handle a specific situation?'    these are just a few|`|G9ywiLqvaa	"do you love children?" would be on top of the list.      other questions will be on your teaching experience, patience, and if your style of teaching will jive with the school's teaching method (yes, they do have a lot of methods nowadays.  look 'em up for added research.).    dress smart but not fancy.  i'm pretty sure they'll expose you to the kids while you're there.  no hanging jewelry (they would get yanked --kids love shiny things), and do wear pants.  i remember a new teacher joining my son's class before and she wore the shortest skirt!  she couldn't even move on the floor to catch the fast-crawling toddlers!  lol!    and, this applies to all industry interviews --tone down on the perfume.    final tip:  you may want to research on the school you're applying for and even on the person who's going to give you the interview.  earn plus points by knowing more about the school than expected.  that will also gauge your interest on the job.    lots of luck!|`|wMzCuPoUaa	They might give you a situation and ask you how would you handle it?

Your strengths and weaknesses?|`|jWCPLVKKaa	Well, first of all. Do you love children?    Anyone who enters a daycare, preschool, Montessori, etc... has to love children unconditionally. Dress nice, not too fancy, because face it you might have to engage with the children while your there, you want to be comfortable/classy. Have a positive presence, and feel free to ask questions about the center.     Good Luck!
jWCPLVKKaa	Get some old cups or bowls, put some small noodles in it or rice, and have the children transfer the rice from bowl to bowl with a small spoon.    Get a tray, with two small bowls, plastic/glass, try the dollar store, fill with cotton balls, pompom balls, and find some old tongs, and have them transfer from bowl to bowl.     Get a big plastic mixing bowl, a small pitcher, have the children put two squirts of soap into the bowl, with two pitchers full of water. Find a whisk from home, or old school egg beaters, and have the children make bubbles in the bowl.     Get some fall corn, the hard brown corn from the grocery store, soak it in water for a night, have the children tweeze off the little corn kernals and fill into a small vase. Just find your own tweezers from home, make sure their clean :)    I could go on forever!!!

You could make GOO! He understood how too! It is so fun! 1 cup makes about 8 easter eggs.    Ingredients  Liquid Starch  Corn Starch  Elmer's Glue  One Cup Cup (I forget what they are called but they hold exactly 1 cup)  2 medium sized, deep bowls  Ziploc Bags  Food Coloring (optional)   Easter Eggs (optional)    Directions  Pour 1 cup of liquid starch into 1 of the deep bowls. Next, pour 1/2 cup of Elmer's Glue into the bowls. Mix it with spoons or hands (I prefer hands). Then, take the glue (you can remove it after about 1 minute of stirring) and put it into the other bowl. After that, take 1 spoonful of cornstarch and put it in the bowl with the glue. Mix it AGAIN! O YEAH! Break the goo into 4 pieces. Put each piece into a different ziploc baggys. Put 3 drops of a color of your choice into the bags. Mix inside bag for about 5 sec. Then remove and mix with hands. Put into easter eggs. (they have Halloween eggs @ Target for $4 for 15 eggs)     
cB8eOVlNaa	As most of your writers stated what you refer to as German Kindergarten would be our preschool system which in most places in done in private settings-not run by public education.  All the above things mentioned are areas that preschool is involved with.  The preschool I teach in starts registration for the upcoming year, the February before the school season which runs from Sept-May.     Our American Kindergarten actually starts in the public school system for most children when they are 5.  In our school district, children must be 5 by Sept. 1, and they begin registration usually in March--before the new school year. Our school year runs from August to June, but I know that can vary state to state.    My son is in kindergarten right now.  It is very involved.  He only goes to kindergarten for half day, but many schools are beginning to run kindergarten for a full(about 6 hours)day.    They do writing, reading, mathematics, homework, center activities.  They travel to other rooms for their specials once a week--art, music, library, gym, etc.  The time they have in their room does not allow much for the aspect of socialization or fun with arts and crafts.  Has he learned a lot?  I would say yes--he is doing well, but he has had 2 years of preschool.  For children that don't get a preschool start, I sometimes wonder if it can be overwhelming.      Good luck.|`|1898bb3795493ca6f65967c559f812a3aa	Here in US some preschools accept kids at 2 and some at 3.For 2 yrs same as mingle with kids,sharing and using spoon and fork.they learn a bit of songs for christmas,easter...and do some painting (u know what i mean their singing and painting).developing their mortar skills.

8SmAx9veaa	Every job has its disadvantages but if you love teaching and you love children then they don't really effect you on your job.. I am a Preschool teacher so its only one year difference. I love my job and I love working with the children, Most people are saying the screaming kids are a disadvantage but its not that's the same at any school age they will still be screaming.  The hardest thing is the public misconceptions of what happens in a preschool/kindergarten, they think there is no learning if they are not sitting down and copying the sheet of paper the teacher has in front of them. This is untrue since children learn through play and experiences just like adults.     Advantages are so many, I love working with the children because they do appericate it and they form a bond with you that is hard to put into words for people who are not teachers. The look on their faces when they finally understand something is my favorite thing to see in the class. The children love you and enjoy being with you and always want you to be happy (even though it doesnt seem it all the time).  This friday I was about to leave and get off when one of the little girls came up with tears in her eyes and said she doesn't want me to go because I am her favorite teacher and she misses me over the weekend. To most they say aww and thats it but to a teacher who loves their job it makes you feel good because it reassures that you and your students have a bond.     Hope this little bit helped you.|`|tUfUjGdlaa	Disadvantages:  -Amount of paperwork  -Responsibility over young lives  -sometimes dealing with parents!  -Lots of work and low pay!  -Lots of overtime that you wont neccessarily get paid for!  -You have to go on training a lot of training :)    Advantages:  -Fun and no two days are the same!  -Seeing kids progress is an amazing feeling  -Feeling lke you make a difference to someone!  -Activities can be fun to do.  -Getting a thank you on the last day of school :)|`|CCojnoIKaa	To answer YOUR question - The DISADVANTAGES of teaching Kindergarten are:  the children cannot write so a lot of TIME goes into preparing lessons.  Think about it - I can make an assignment to third graders and leave them to do it in class.  In Kindergarten, I cannot.  I am constantly "on stage".  They are watching my every move for 7.5 hours.  In that time, I have to teach them the building blocks for learning.  Language is in EVERYTHING and if they don't grasp that, they are doomed from the beginning.  What are letters?  Why are they important?  What do they mean?  I have a child who calls the letter a " the ball with a stick" (lowercase a).  See?  To him it is a symbol.  It doesn't MEAN anything.  That is a daunting task.  Because my students cannot write, I must figure out other ways to assess what they have learned.  For anyone who thinks teaching Kindergarten is easy, you are sorely mistaken!  It does not consist of a day full of "playing and coloring"!|`|RZOPZgnzaa	disadvantages- Little crazyyy kids screaming and running all around drawing on the walls with markers and paint....

UOmhBNxKaa	As stated in the previous answers, an assistant will make about minimum wage.  If you get your associates or cda you can earn more as a lead teacher or teacher assistant in a school system.  In some states you can be the director with a 2 year degree.  Obviously the more education, the higher the pay.  Although working with children (like working with the elderly) is a very low paying profession.  You do it because it's your calling, not to get rich.  If it isn't your passion, then find another field as you won't be happy.    Is the assistant job demanding?  No.   But it can be stressful.  You'd be doing everything the teacher doesn't want to.  Clean up accidents, run kids to the bathroom, clean up bloody noses, paperwork, etc. It's a grunt job.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Childcare workers can make any where between 9-12 dollars per hour. It is a salary  you can barley live on these days. It demanding depending the class, the age of the kids, the parents, the teacher you work with, the daycare setting. Daycare also has the following drawbacks: Long hours, No vacation, no benifits (health). It is a good place to start to see if you like working w/ kids.   Daycare assistants: Support the activity the teacher is doing, help w/dicpline , bullention  boards,copy papers,clean up, help set up centers, help set out snack or lunch, keep the centers flowing.|`|i5tOQGgFaa	I agree with Bittersweet.    As an assistant you will make minimum wage.  If you go onto to college and get at least your CDA, you'll likely be able to move up to a lead teacher.  If you go on for you Bacherlor's degree with an early childhood endorsement...you have even more options.  If you get special education and early childhood training you will have EVEN MORE options.  You'll never be rich.  :-)  But those of us in the field know that we do this for the kids not for the money.    Is it a demanding job...probably not an assistant.  However, as a lead teacher or director, etc.  Yes, it's demanding.  There is a lot involved.      Good luck in your decision making.|`|tUfUjGdlaa	Most assistants get minimum wage if they are level 2, slightly more for level 3. You can get 6 something if you have extra responsibilities.    It is demanding as there is paperwork, training, meetings and of course you are responsible for childrens welfare and education so thats demanding. But if you do the job for the love of children then its VERY rewarding.     I may not be rich, but every day i enjoy my job!|`|pgFD4n1Caa	Oh my, this is by far the worst paying job because you are not the teacher, you are over worked and under appreicated.

Some children are just spoiled that way and unless you are overly exerting/harming yourself in some fashion they will not be happy.  Ok, that's exaggerating a bit, but you get my point.  I'd say for you to keep doing what you're doing and maybe she'll come around?    I know that for me personally--little girls didn't like me either until I gave birth to my own little girl.  I don't know what it is about being a mom, b/c I don't feel like I've changed one bit--but children love me now and I don't have to try at all...    Good luck though.

Sadly some children are like that.  I agree completely that you should give her 2 choices at a time to choose from.  If you need to do all the choices...let her choose which one to do first etc.  You can also ask your direct supervisor for suggestions.

UOmhBNxKaa	Obviously this mom doesn't want to hear what you have to say unless it's all positive, as she has the perfect child.  lol.  I'd suggest that when she comes in, acknowledge her politely and just say he had a fine day.  If she wants more information, she needs to ask you.      If this doesn't work, ask for a sit down with mom, you and the director.  This way you can all discuss the situation and all hear the same info at the same time.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Maybe you can have a "My Day Report" we handed those out daily and we wrote what we did during the day and at the end we had three smiley face  A Happy Face  A neutral face  A frown face   We circled the appropriate  face based on the child's day.

Our policy is if the problem is handled at preschool through time-out, a trip to my office or whatever, the parents are not told about it since it was handled "in-house".  If the problem involves hitting or biting other children, then we do let parents know.      Any child can have an "off-day."  If you have one, no one calls your mom and tells her, right?  Before you tell a parent anything, the behavior needs to be documented over a few days.  If the problem keeps up, have the director intervene on your behalf.  ALWAYS make sure the director know what you are reporting to a parent.  My staff is not allowed to report a child's behavior to the parents until they have documented repeated problems.    In my early years, I had parents that pulled children out because they were tired of negative comments.      The child you are referring to doesn't like school because he is hearing his mom complain about you.  You can turn this around by remembering that he is a preschooler and it's his job to aggravate you.  Your job is to rise above it, keep smiling and catch that child being good and praise him.  If he is a good sitter during circle time, if he fingerpaints on the paper (most of the time) or if he manages to get his snack in his mouth, praise him!  Eventually he will want to please you elsewhere.      Sorry about the parents, but you do have their prize possession in your care.  They have to look for the good since he spends most of his time with them and not you!|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	It's called 'Helicopter Mom Syndrome'. The parents drill the child, about the day, all the details, what went wrong. Nothing you can say or do will reassure the parents. As with any parent you speak with, start off with a couple of positives. Then, discuss that 'off day' the child had. Let the parent know what you tried to do to reassure the child. Be that 'positive chipper role-model' for the parent to see.|`|cB8eOVlNaa	It is sad to say, but sometimes there are just certain people you are not going to be able to make happy.  Throughout my many years as a preschool teacher, parent interaction was always my most worrisome.  Am I saying the right thing?  Have I said enough? Did I say too much?, etc.      One year, I had a mom that I could not please, we did everything we thought was right, but it never was.  I learned to just smile and say we had a great day, and go about my business.      I know it's not easy, but try not to stress too much about it.   |`|i5tOQGgFaa	Your best bet is to just smile when you see her and let it be all the response you give her.  There are some mom's that are just like that and I agree with the "helicopter mom syndrome".  That's exactly what she sounds like.     Maybe toward the end of the day you can have the child draw a picture of something he enjoyed doing that day and he can show it to his mom and talk about it.  Then the "spotlight" isn't on you.      Another technique I used once with a "troublesome" parent.  After I smiled at her then I put my attention on the child.  We talked about the things we did that day and some of the things that I noticed that child enjoyed.  I never included the parent in the conversation.  I made a point to get down to the child's level and talk with them.  Ending it in a positive "we'll see you tomorrow".    As for the "off" day comment.  Saying they had an "off" day is not saying they were "bad".  Tsk tsk on the director and parent.  :-)  But that's just my opinion.  As a parent...I wanted to know if it was an "off" day.  It gave me a heads-up to what the evening was going to be like.  Also was a sign that the child may be coming down with something.  So sorry that your director feels you can't form such a relationship with your parents that you can honestly talk about the day.  Sure makes life easier.  Parents and teachers are a team...or should be.  Of course...3 positives to 1 negative.  :-)      Hope it gets easier for you!|`|jgYhKaACaa	smile and be as nice as you can without giving away anything important. children can have off days yes but don't tell parents that unless its a consistent problem that keeps getting worse. I think this way because its part of the child's life that they get into trouble sometimes and if the behavior doesn't happen then you cant correct it.   the idea about having the child draw about his day was good and if the parent still  insists then tell them to ask for a conference with the director and choose your words carefully like neutral carefully.|`|ad67DRbeaa	It sounds like the parents just like to complain and will do it no matter what you say. So I would just keep doing what your doing and try not to worry too much about it.

At table time, lunch, reading, outside, etc. Stick to em like glue. Oh, and start documenting everything he does in a notebook.

You might consider taking turns as hall monitor to thart escapees.    Grandpa  |`|lVuvUqoiaa	Why did the child get 3 teachers fired but still at the school?  This child needs to be reprimanded by his parents, teachers and the director of the school.  It seems like he's not getting in trouble for leaving the classroom, that the teachers are the ones getting in trouble.  He's 3, he's old enough to understand what's safe and what's dangerous, and what's ok and not ok.  He needs to be punished for trying to leave and punished for putting his hands in filthy toilet water.  So punish him, by time out or not telling him do something fun or however you see fit.  Good luck to you!  :-)  |`|wMzCuPoUaa	It happens you have to keep an eye on these types of children. They almost have to be your shadow. Reward him for staying in the classroom  maybe he needs motivation i.e. a sticker chart/ for everyday he stays in the classroom he gets a sticker. If he gets five stickers he gets a prize of some type Find out what he REALLY likes to do and use that as a reward or at the very least keeping him the class. Maybe put bells on the door so you can hear him leaving the class. Maybe he is one of those kids that need a lot of sensory activities try doing activities that stimulate the senses i.e. water table,sand table, finger painting,play doh etc. Document everything he does in a note book.     PS: Is Your class room have many open spaces? Try to make a lot of boundaries/ closed spaces  for him i.e. use desks and book cases to make it harder for him.        GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|gyzMxjAiaa	There is no way to make a day care escape proof because doing so would mean making the emergency exit doors unworkable. That could lead to disaster in case of a fire. Try putting a string of bells on the doors to the room, and keep a sharp eye on him. It's amazing how fast a determined little kid can move.|`|5qicXiniaa	The key here is the child, seems his interest is not centered on staying indoors. He tends to be disobedient and knows it by merely playing with the toilet. Security at the daycare may be sufficient, but his boundaries do not coincide with their coverage. He should be monitored more closely and get to know what can happen if he does leave, once observing that he should be rewarded for doing the right thing and staying indoors. As far as the toilet issue, if he has no business being near one, he should stay away, and again, learn that wrong choices lead to consequences.|`|tUfUjGdlaa	Yes I would be very worried about how that chap is finding ways to get out!!!    a) If his behaviour is bad he needs one to one then he should have some sort of support plan, IEP or something and you should look into funding for a support assistant to work one to one with him.    b) The setting needs to look at their security! Like you said doors should be secured, windows safe etc. Our doors have locks (sliding ones) at the top so children cant reach. If someone goes out the room then staff lock door behind them and adult knocks to get back in.     I think you should talk to owner about it or maybe even go over their head to OFSTED or something! Its not worth you getting bad record if something happens in your care but it wasnt ur fault!|`|i5tOQGgFaa	How old is this child?  Is he 3?  Younger?    Your job is to look at the general situation and work some preventative procedures in.    *  Someone mentioned to shadow him.  You bet.  It's sometimes draining to be the one who shadows every day...so work out a schedule between you and your aide(s).  You may wish to suggest that if there are any "floaters" available that they be placed in your classroom when not needed elsewhere.  Gives you all a little hand.    * bathroom- he has lost his privilege to enter the bathrooms unattended.  A staff member must be with him at all times.      * how can you rearrange the classroom to "slow" him down.  As already been mentioned...you can "escape" proof a day care.  They mentioned bells on the door.  Depending on the child's age and ability...can you put the plastic door covers on the door knobs?    Do not block the door, but set up your cubbies/shelving units so it's like a "hallway" from your door into your classroom.  Not a straight one either... make it L shaped.  It does help.  When I had an escaper...they'd get the "look" from across the room and hightail it to the door.  They had a running start.  Well, maneuvering the "hallway" slows them down.    * Write a behavior plan, include parents and director (especially director if you have never done this before).  Have a visual discipline plan for the child that EVERY staff member follows through on.  Be consistent.  Even if it doesn't seem to work.  One of the special education teachers mentioned to use that they had a rule that you keep on trying until there is a "better idea".  Having a consistent plan is better then not having one.  Sometimes it's the consistency that does the trick...not so much the consequence.    *  be honest with your director.  If you have never dealt with this before...discuss it.  Come up with a plan together.  Directors are suppose to be mentors.  It does not show "weakness" asking for help.  It shows you care and want to learn more of how to handle the situation correctly.    *  maybe I should have mentioned this one first...you need to form a positive relationship with this child.  Start fresh every day.  Have a ritual when he arrives and leaves that shows that you care about him.  Forming that relationship often helps with behavior.    *  there are public employees that deal specifically with behavior and they will come and observe him.  Discuss this with your director.  Maybe more needs to be done...especially if he's preschool age/4 years.  If he is younger...there is always at least one in a group.  :-)    *  observe the child and document.  Just watching the child over a period of time may very likely give you clues to "triggers"/reasons, etc.  Once you know where it is stemming from...you can help the child even more.    *  find some calm/sit down activities that he likes to do that can relax him. Playdough, silly putty, etc.  I find that many "escapers" are high-strung as well.    Give him a chance...do the extra work involved to help him be successful.  Not only with he be effected for life, hopefully, you will have the satisfaction of making such a difference in a child's life.  And that is what we are in this field for! Good luck!|`|AA12115624	HE got 3 teachers fired! It sounds like 3 teachers got fired because they weren't watching him close enough!   There will always be children that are challenging. You didn't say how old he was. This school may not be the right environment for this child. Talk to the parents about his behavior at home. Is it the same as at school? How does she handle his behavior at home? Does she have suggestions for things that might work with him that work at home. Involve the parent- don't blame her but help her be part of a solution to help the boy's behavior.
QASEsJXeaa	Hide the objects around the room give the children color cards let them go around the room collecting the items that match their color. Some may find three others seven don't just hide a few the more the better. If you see a child having problems finding objects help them. Some of the objects can even be on walls on top of bookshelves in other words make sure they or easy to find.
FgFmj8d2aa	I was going to answer one of your other questions, until I saw that you've asked at least 3 different ones regarding the same activity and obviously haven't even bothered to change the wording of the question given to you. Seriously? Write your own lesson plans. It's not that difficult. How will you learn to do them if other people are doing them for you?
djBMmP3Taa	Take notes of everything. For most courses in High School and Junior College, most of what is on the tests and homework will be discussed in the class. If your teacher draws a diagram on the board, copy that down - it can help you remember the information. Don't just copy what they write on the board, either: take extensive notes on everything.   Calculate how much of your grade a project is worth. Prioritize. You won't get a high score if you don't aim for one.   Homework comes first over everything else: set yourself goals and make sure you reach them before you go out and party. Social life is important too, but make sure your work comes first.   With homework, don't travel into unknown territory, use your notes to answer what the teacher is asking for: if you see something that you're not sure is true, or that you're not sure your teacher will agree with, don't say it. Do it correctly, checking to make sure you have no mistakes, and you can't mess up. Look over your homework in detail at least once before you turn it in, and if you're uncertain about something ask your teacher!   With tests, take the notes and make a study guide. Look in the textbook and add anything not in your notes, do not omit anything. Then make someone test you on the study guide, sing the question and answer, whatever. Use memory tricks. If you know it all, then make yourself do an essay on tricky stuff, like really understanding the thing. In the essay, write: know how to understand _____. Then do a problem with _____, or two problems, not omiting anything of any type. Make sure you did it right. Ask your teacher if you can do an essay or extra sheet of problems for extra credit. If she says yes, hand it in the next day. If she hands it back before the test, you'll see your mistakes and be able to fix them   When taking tests, relax. If you're fidgety, or worried that you'll fail the test, you're sure to get a low score.Except for me, I get really high scores on tests when I worry.   Remember the most important advice to get good grades is very simple; do well on tests and quizzes to get yourself a A or A-. Do your homework and do what your teacher says, and the chances are fairly good that you'll get an A+. Don't stress yourself. Act cool and calm.   Write good legible notes. Colored pens are fun to write with if you want to get more creative with your notes, but use them only for sections of your notes that you feel will be on a test or that are important. It makes them stand out. Use highlighters if there's something you need to find easily flipping through your notes, but don't highlight too much text or it destroys the point.   Making your notes fun to read will make them much easier to understand when you go back to look!   Watch to determine how your teachers teach, use the same method to learn the information. If they write on the blackboard, take notes; if they lecture, listen hard or record the lecture to listen to multiple times. This sounds simple, but many will find it hard to stay focused for an entire class period. Here is where the hard work comes in - staying focused.   Try to do your homework immediately after school. Time management is essential. If you're given an assignment that's due next week, don't procrastinate; get started the same day you get the assignment (See more about this in Tips).   Note that teachers want you to give them back what they gave you. So give it to them! By now you have learned how the teacher is giving you the information and you have had plenty of time to sink it in. Give it back to the teacher. Do this by using the knowledge they've taught you and apply it to your homework, tests, and projects.   Always do your homework! This can't be stressed enough. It's so easy to forget or to just put it off. Get a calender system for your computer to remind you a few days before the homework is due. If you have trouble remembering it, use a notebook to write it down everyday, right after the teacher assigns it. Homework counts for a large portion of your grade. If your teacher has any extra credit assignments, do them! It won't hurt if you try it out. Even if you get some wrong, I'm sure your teachers will still give you some points back.   Stay organized. A lot of people say this but it really does help. Organizing your locker helps you remember to bring your supplies to class and to your house to do your homework or studying. Organizing your notes will make them much easier to understand later on. Also keep your desk/study space tidy, and make sure you have a clean, quiet place to study and do homework that is withdrawn from the main part of the house and from noise.   Review your notes every night, so when the big test comes, remembering what you learned is a snap.   Get good sleep. you need sleep in order to stay focused and with out it you will have a hard time staying on task and you will forget what you just learned . So get lots of sleep and always eat a good breakfast. The breakfast|`|61xjSkboaa	well, in my opinion 6th grade is the easiest grade after elementary school so you should start good school habits now before its too late.  You should focus less on social things and focus on school instead.  My sister has the same problem right now because she worries more about social things and not at all on school.

Jwk7Ib2vaa	You seem like a smart kid, I'd go with Philosophy for sure. If your teacher/professor is good enough at doing their job, you'll be in for a treat. This isn't a free ride though, Philosophy tests the way you think and perceive pretty much everything around you. I took it as a freshman in college and hated it...at first. Then I started to wrap my mind around what the prof was trying to teach us, and I loved every second after wards. It truly is a very entertaining class, and since it doesn't seem like you are looking for a free ride, this is most likely right up your alley.

The gram, originally one millionth of the mass of a cubic metre of water, is currently defined by one thousandth of the mass of a specific object that is kept in a vault in France; however there are efforts underway to redefine it in terms of physical quantities that could be reproduced in any laboratory with suitable equipment. The second, originally one 86400th of the mean solar day and now defined by atomic clocks, is usually chosen as the base unit of time. Varying choices have been made for the third base unit, the one that is needed to incorporate the field of electromagnetics; As of 2006 this is the ampere, being the base unit of electrical current. Other quantities are derived from the base units; for example, the basic unit of speed is metres per second. As each new definition is introduced, it is designed to match the previous definition as precisely as possible, so these changes of definition have not affected most practical applications. (See SI and individual unit articles for full definitions.)    The names of multiples and submultiples are formed with prefixes. They include deca- (ten), hecto- (hundred), kilo- (thousand), mega- (million), and giga- (billion); deci- (tenth), centi- (hundredth), milli- (thousandth), micro- (millionth), and nano- (billionth). The most commonly used prefixes for multiples depend on the application and sometimes tradition. For example, long distances are stated in thousands of kilometres, not megametres.    Most everyday users of the metric system measure temperature in degrees Celsius, though the SI unit is the kelvin, a scale whose units have the same "size", but which starts at absolute zero. Zero degrees Celsius equals 273.15 kelvins (the word "degree" is no longer to be used with kelvins).    Angular measurements have been decimalised, but the older non-decimal units of angle are far more widely used. The decimal unit, which is not part of SI, is the gon or grad, equal to one hundredth of a right angle. Subunits are named, rather than prefixed: the gon is divided into 100 decimal minutes, each of 100 decimal seconds. The traditional system, originally Babylonian, has 360 degrees in a circle, 60 minutes of arc (also called arcminutes) in a degree, and 60 seconds of arc (also called arcseconds) in a minute. The clarifier "of arc" is dropped if it is clear from the context that we are not speaking of minutes and seconds of time). Sometimes angles are given as decimal degrees, e.g., 26.4586 degrees, or in other units such as radians (especially in scientific uses other than astronomy) or angular mils.

1ab64e59b314db5cba44c6b5716d1244aa	I think it would be easier if everybody just went to the nearest exit... you know how the teacher lines you up at the door and escorts you out? DUMB! In a real fire, I can see that happening. NOT!   What if you are in another class when somethings happens.. what if one of the entrances gets blocked? You need to know and Pracitce ALL THE EXITS!  Tiiming is a good idea, and randomizing the fired drills, so NO ONE including teachers know when it's coming..  You need to practice to see if you can improve your times so if there is a real disaster, Most if not ALL students will be able to get out.  And getting down low to avoid smoke is a good idea but know one ever practices it.  And what if there is an asthmatic in the school? He would be one of the first to pass out. I think you should install a buddy system where you everyone would help everyone else instead of everyone for themselves.  When a disaster strikes - people get OUT. They don't wait at the door for the teacher! That is compleley stupid. Let every teacher be responsible ONLY for those in his class. I don't mean homeroom class, but for example if you are in geography class - the geography teacher should be responsible for his geography students at the time the disaster breaks out - what if one of the students were running an errand for this teacher - who else would know except this teacher and his students?

Frankly, this is so common I feel there needs to be a medical diagnosis for "love sickness" because it does have sever psychological and physiological implications for the individual.
50WCN0graa	They really aren't the same, they are different.     As far as job opportunities go, there are waaaay more special education jobs available then early education jobs. Actually, early education jobs are some of the most competitive and hard to get. There has been a huge flooding of that market. Where I live there are thousands of unemployed or underemployed people with early education degrees.... that said, if you want it bad enough and work hard enough, there are still jobs available, but there are hundreds of people applying for every position.    There are parts of the country, however, where there is a shortage of teachers, so it isn't as hard to find jobs in either field. North Carolina and Florida are 2 states dealing with teacher shortages. You have to research your city... ask around so you can find out. Are you willing to move?    Both jobs are fun and rewarding. They are different. Any job in education requires patience, hard work, persistence, and tenderness, but especially special education. If you like working with children in smaller groups or one-on-one and you enjoy children with special needs, maybe you would like to be a special education teacher. If you think you would lose patience, maybe it is not the route for you.    Best Wishes|`|RVABrMeSaa	The way the economy is right now study for both. If you are done studying look for work in both fields. More chance of getting hired.|`|EY7xhPJnaa	I think special ed would be more rewarding!|`|U4NaCjbCaa	both of them are the same|`|0c26d9546e638de3a2d0bd923ac856beaa	Do both so you'll be highly qualified.  Many states won't hire a sp. ed. teacher any longer unless they have the el. ed. degree with it.  If you're only going to do one, do sp. ed. and get severe/intense disabilities with it.  That's the most promising field right now.  It is very easy to find a job in sp. ed., and somewhat difficult in many areas to get a job in regular ed.

Por lo general, la primera se?al de un embarazo suele ser la falta del perodo menstrual. Sin embargo, un perodo que no se presenta a la fecha debida no siempre significa que hay un beb en camino. No todas las mujeres comienzan sus perodos en el mismo momento cada mes. Incluso si suele tener perodos regulares, el estrs, una enfermedad o cambios en ejercicios o hbitos de la dieta pueden demorar la menstruacin. Usted podra estar embarazada si: * No le ha venido el perodo en el ltimo mes o dos meses (No me ha llegado) * Tiene que ir a orinar con frecuencia (Ay!! es cierto) * Encuentra que ciertos olores y sabores le provocan nuseas (Un poquito nomas) * Se le antoja comer algo en particular (Siii...o seran cosas mias?) * Tiene nuseas o vmitos (Pos eso no) * Los senos parecen ms hinchados y sensibles que lo normal (Si...me duelen...tan sencibles) * Se siente cansada (Y mucho!) * Est estre?ida (Eso siempre) * Est emocionalmente muy sensible y llora con facilidad (Si, buaaa) * Tiene un aumento en el flujo vaginal (Concho, eso tambien lo tengo!) No se preocupe si no tiene todas estas se?ales de embarazo. Algunas mujeres no tienen otras se?ales mas que una falta de menstruacin, otras tienen muchas de las se?ales que mencionamos. Si no le ha venido el perodo y piensa que podra estar embarazada, puede averiguarlo usando una prueba de embarazo de uso personal. Estos pruebas analizan la orina en busca de una hormona llamada "hCG" que est presente en su cuerpo cuando est embarazada. Estos sistemas le pueden decir casi inmediatamente y con precisin si est embarazada o no, y puede encontrarlos en farmacias y en algunos supermercados. Los puede usar ya en el primer da de la falta de su menstruacin. Los profesionales de la salud tambin usan el anlisis de orina como los sistemas de uso personal para averiguar si una mujer est embarazada. Tambin usan el anlisis de sangre ya que el resultado se obtiene un poco ms temprano que con el de orina y a la vez ayuda a calcular la fecha del parto cuando no est segura. Esto puede ocurrir algunas veces si tiene perodos irregulares o no se acuerda de la fecha de la que comenz su ltima menstruacin. Si el resultado de la prueba de embarazo muestra que est embarazada, es importante que se comunique con su mdico y comience con sus cuidados prenatales. Te interesa?

f4yod8haaa	Where's the question?|`|mx3gFmIKaa	My suggestion to you is to refrain from suggesting solutions.  It is likely that your step daughter views this as unsolicited advice, and she may feel like a failure as a parent.  By what you describe its seems as though she is viewing you as an opposition, when all you are trying to do is help.  Let her know you are on her side.  She may not be looking for a solution, but an ear to hear what is going on.  I would reassure her that her boy is smart, and that his abilities are underestimated.  Ask her what the teacher thinks they should do to help him.  |`|wMzCuPoUaa	Don't blame the kids teachers she has some 2o other kids to deal with in the classroom. Your grandson is one of many kids in the class.   Maybe he is not in the right setting  for him. Perhaps  a lot of unnecessary pressure is put on him that is too much for him to handle.  Or perhaps  he needs to be in a more structured school setting.  Or perhaps he is overwhelmed by the class size maybe he needs a small group setting. |`|i5tOQGgFaa	Well, unfortunately since he isn't your son... you can only set the example.  As it sounds, words/advice doesn't seem to help, so just be an example.  When he's at your house, continue with the expecations that you have.  All you can do is love both the child and his mom.  Doesn't mean you have to agree with the parenting style.  :-)      As for the teacher, yes, that is dissappointing.  What "testing" are they doing at 4 years?  Grading?  Never heard of such a thing in PreK.  I do informal evaluations and a lot of what my thoughts are regarding their development is based on what I see through their play and at small group.  I can usually see right off who is not applying themselves and who really doesn't know the skill.      You don't really have much say since you are not primary caregiver...but can you volunteer in the classroom and see how things are approached?  Maybe once you see how the program runs you can have an informal conversation with his teacher...commenting on things he has done at your place.  Also, you could ask what types of skills she is looking for and maybe you can incorporate them while playing with your grandson so that she can observe.  With children, it often boils down to expectation.  They'll do it for those that expect them to.    Good luck.|`|MWNIQ5kFaa	Make up a fun game.

i5tOQGgFaa	mommy068 is correct.  We tend to ask open ended questions that get you talking.  It's amazing what we learn regarding that person.    If you really don't know the answer, be honest.  It's okay to say that, I'm not quite sure how I would respond in the situation.  Have the attitude that you'd be interested in hearing their opinion and that you are always willing to learn.    They will probably ask you about your philosophy...so think about that.    They will ask you not only kid related questions but also, what would you do in the situation of a parent "problem".  Or a staffing problem.    Of course they will ask you your previous experience.  What you learned; what was the hardest situation you have dealt with, etc.  Good luck!|`|wMzCuPoUaa	What is your favorite part about working w/kids?least favorite?

Keep in mind traffic patterns allowing safe movement around the room, making pathways wide and clear.     Set up a circle area for daily activities and transitions from game to game.  A carpeted area for blocks, a science table located near a sink, and sand / water / sensory tables with buckets, spoons, forks, etc. for creative expression.  A dramatic play area with a pretend kitchen and a dress-up bin, an area for books and reading, and a section of the room for games and puzzles.  And a few art easels with drawing supplies and paper.     Tables spaced around the room for crafts and smooth, easy-clean surfaces and carpets will help.

We then have a quiet area with books, tape player and headphones, pillows etc, role play which is usually a house as its more comforting, a pc area with two chairs to support social skills, a small world mat with low level units full of everytype of small world so children can choose themselvesand mix n match. Then we have three low level tables and a writing area which again has a self-select shelf full of stencils, paper, pens etc. We then have open access to outdoor which isalso set up into areas to reflect the importance of learning outdoors as well as indoors.    Areas that arent being used:  -make smaller as children may not have interest for that area yet but may develop interest later so dont get rid of it! Just make interested areas bigger for now.  -have an adult there-often if adult is doing something children will go join in and then when adult leaves children often continue after being 'inspired'.  -look at the resources-are they interesting, clean, set out well, self-select or adult chosen etc. Is is bright and inviting?

Yes, I did get along with my supervisor, we both communicated with each other well, understood our roles in the work place, shared ideas on various things, had staff gatherings in the local pub!    One shouldn't feel as if they need anything from anyone in particular, however, a supervisor should be supportive, approachable, considerate, follows various equal opportunities rules and generally kind and respectful to all members of staff. The staff should also be the above with other practitioners and the supervisor.    Depends what you mean by "win you over", a supervisor shouldn't feel the need to, if they aren't happy with a member of staff, they will pull them aside and explain why. Personally, to win me over (and anyone who actually cares about the Early Years careers) should hope the supervisor is supportive and interested in both the children and the staff.    
wdmp9eYXaa	sounds like the daycare is not well organized. they should have an area where every child should have a place to keep there personal belongings. each personal belonging that comes into the center for the children should have their names on them and should be placed into their own personal space. when it is time to go out side have to children at a time go and get their belongings that are needed for them to go outside.after they have retrieved their belongings if they are capable og putting on their garments and everything themselves let them do so. if they need help with something them the teacher(s) should help them. when the first two come back then send the next two to go get their things, and so forth in the mean time have the ones already prepared sit on the floor in a circle or whatever and have someone do finger games with them i.e. finger puppets doing 5 little monkeys ,etc. until all the children are ready to go outside. i hope this gives some help to you and your center. Many Blessings!|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Have the teacher take half the class and have the assistant take the other half of the class. So the teacher puts on coats and takes the class out while the assistant  reads to the other half of the class and then when the first group is out the assistant gets her group ready to go out.    Have a clear pocket shoe holder where the kids can put extras like their mittens and hats. One pocket for each child    Teach the kids to hang up stuff properly in the first place|`|a08tR6Fkaa	I assume there are at least two adults in the class, as this is the norm nowadays.    Have one teacher or aid sit on the carpet with the children and have another outside standing by the door. The teacher on the carpet makes a big deal of looking for children who are sitting nicely. One at a time, she picks children to go over to their peg or cubby and get their coat, gloves etc. If children run or push they should be called back to the carpet.     Once they have their things, the children put their coats on and fasten up if they can and line up by the door. The teacher or aid by the door calls the children through one at a time and helps those who need it e.g. doing zips up, and keeps an eye on those who have already gone outside. Once about half the children have gone outside, the adult by the door goes to supervise outside, and the teacher who was on the carpet takes over doing zips up etc.     Coming back inside, the process is reversed with a teacher standing outside sending children through one at a time to get their coats off and wait on the carpet with the second teacher.     This is the method used in the nursery department (3 and 4 year olds) of the school where I work and the children very quickly get the hang of it. |`|i5tOQGgFaa	Looks like we mostly agree that they need to do a few children at a time.  Each child should have their own cubby with their own things in it.  One teacher is at circle time doing a transitional activity or reading a book or singing songs etc and the other teacher is helping two or three children at a time get organized.  Those children can either line up at the door or go back to the carpet and participate with the group until all are ready.  Lining up at the door works fine as long as they can still see the book or participate in the activity.  Instead of lining up at the door they can line up near the back of the carpet/circle time.  Eventually, the children will become independent and a few more children can go at one time.  It's wise to be aware of where cubbies are and dismiss children who are at different ends :-)  At least 1 cubby in between.  Especially in the winter...preschool children need space to get in their winter gear.  When we let only 2 or 3 go...there is less distraction.  Also, it would be wise to incorporate some dressing skills during the day so that the children become independent in putting their coats on, zipping, putting hats and gloves on etc.  If there are some children who are having a situation getting coats on, I suggest teaching the 1-2-3 over the head technique.  Children lay coat on floor, with arm holes up.  They stand at the hood, put their arms into their sleeves and then 1-2-3 over their head it goes.  I've had 2 year olds have success with that.  Takes practice though!      Good luck!

Positive re-directions for toddlers and preschoolers, Have some one knowledgeable in classroom arrangement is helpful, Bring some one in to talk about special needs ie; mild autism, ADAH, children with allergies.

For younger children you could have--Duck, Duck, Goose-Simon Says-  Red Light, Green Light,-Mother May I.  Have balls for catch, rolling, you can even play educational games with the ball.  For example, roll the ball to someone and have them name a; color, shape, favorite food, favorite character, etc.  Hula hoops are great for some fun games too.

UOmhBNxKaa	There are lots of reasons staff will leave a facility.  Here are just a few:    Not being supported by management when it comes to helping with behavior problems or problem parents.    Low pay.  They will leave for another job that pays 10 cents more as that makes a difference to a profession that pays so badly.    Benefits.  Could be better.  Not all centers offer benefits that workers can afford or are worth the money.    Training after hours.  Some places won't pay you for your training.  Although it is usually against the law not to.    Low moral in the center.  Centers are terrible about gossip and if management doesn't do anything about it, it can cause the good ones to leave.    Being unappreciated by management or the company.|`|tUfUjGdlaa	Reason people leave:  -Feeling forced to retrain or go higher up in education when they may not wish to or may not feel able to (esp true for more mature employees who are told to update training to level 4 to keep jobs)  -Again the above as in April settings will get funding based on how highly qualified staff are so staff feel forced to train!  -Lots of paperwork, meetings, training etc and not higher pay!  -Hiring-lots of various childcare jobs and so those with training will often go to higher paid or supervisery jobs meaning not so many assistants!  -Settings are changing-stress of OFSTED, parent partnership etc means that theres more stress and some people dont want that :)  -Hours-with nurseries now taking children just after 3rd birthday it means preschool loses children and cut hours so staff leave for jobs with more hours (often out of childcare).  -Bullying that can sometimes happen in larger settings.    Enticements:  -Higher wages or paid for paperwork time-even just hour a day at end of session so we dont have to take work home all the time!  |`|USZ4ehnSaa	I taught in a preschool and a regular day care.  It's a very stressful environment.  Punishment for the bad children means staying in a corner or sitting down and talking to the child, but if they are bad they don't listen and they just keep testing you, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.  You have dirty diapers and potty training, not with just one but many.  You could have that one bad child say you did something you didn't, and there's nothing you can do about that either.  At the end of the day you have to deal with parents that sometimes you don't agree with or you have to remember what the child did.  Every day is planned and you need to know what you are going to be teaching them.  I had major conflicts with the other teacher cause she would often be holding back my class from doing it's activities, or couldn't make it in, or what not.  Parents wanted their children ready when class was over, and it was constant teaching of manners and rules.  The kids were great and it was a fun job but the pay I received for the responsibility that was asked of me was way to low and I found that to be true at all three places I worked.

G9ywiLqvaa	in my son's old preschool, they used to have classical music play through the PA system during work period.  and believe it or not, the music really calms the savage beast!  my son, generally hyper, becomes calmer and more focused.  apparently, the soothing music subconsciously 'suggests' a certain mood and rhythm to the brain.  as opposed to silence.  in a silent classroom, children (hyper or not) will make as much noise as they can to fill the void.  try it!  i'm not a fan of mozart myself but whatever works on these kids, right?  :)|`|wMzCuPoUaa	I tried it w/ a rowdy group of kindergartners and they were very calm when working.

i5tOQGgFaa	I tend to agree with Bittersweet's response.  Often at this age they are just beginning to really notice changes and appearances and the differences between boys and girls.  Touching themselves is not abnormal at this stage.   It's wise to stay matter of fact about these types of things.    Touching his brother...saying "nasty" things (like what?) is something you need to be concerned with.  I wouldn't blame it completely on the preschool but it could be part of it.  The children all come from different families and every family as different values.  You should feel welcome to bring this up to his teacher.  She would know if there is any sort of behavior such as that happening in the classroom...and if not...she needs to be on the look out for it so she can handle it on her end...so please do inform the teacher.    As for TV...some "kid's" TV shows are not that great either.    I agree...you need to ask your son...not necessarily in the "heat of the moment".  So many times we, as adults, get "embarrassed" and it makes our "correction" sharp.  Later, discuss it with him.  He may very well tell you.      I would also consider what he may be witnessing amongst the family.  It's not uncommon for a child to "walk-in" on some love-making at this stage.  At about age 4 of our eldest, we started locking our door.  :-) If they have...it's not going to "hurt" them forever...it's how we handle it.  Being matter of fact... being clear that this is something ADULTS do to show they love each other, etc.  Maybe there is something on tv at a relative's house?  A friend's house?    Though often at this stage it isn't really necessarily a sign of molestation....you do want to be concerned about it.  Remember that most cases happen between a "loved one"...one that a child can trust...and the child.      If you feel extremely concerned...you may wish to get some trained individuals involved...your family doctor/pediatrician should be able to help you out in that regard.    |`|QyVrdgwJaa	not normal    be concerned|`|3zo8OMPqaa	He needs help, that is not normal, put filters on your tv and internet and ask him where he learned it from|`|G9ywiLqvaa	if it stopped at touching himself, that would be normal for a preschool boy.  but when you went into him touching his brother and asking him to do the nasties for him, yup, i got concerned.    if you're positive he didn't get this from home, you definitely must tell the director about this.  the things he's doing is not at all sex education.  it's something he may have seen actually happen.  or worse, done to him in school.  i don't want to panic you, but i'm just speaking as a mom of 2 boys myself.  your post worried me.  please speak to the director as soon as possible.  if he does not give you a viable explanation in a week, i'd move your son to another preschool.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Take him to your pediatrician |`|a5f0410e8f119074238a8fceda8f4787aa	if it were my son i would be very concerned that maybe hes learning it at school. but not by the teachers it could be the other children in his class that teach him.|`|Q6Md8g5iaa	A 4 year old touching himself is normal.  Touching others and asking for "nasty stuff" to be done is definitely something to be concerned about.    Do you have access to an EAP at work?  Do you have health insurance that offers any kind of family counseling?  I would suggest you seek the advice of a professional, and not necessarily anyone at the preschool.    Good Luck.|`|tUfUjGdlaa	Often at this age its simply curiosity and not neccessarily a sign that something bad has/is happening.     However if his behaviour has started to change along side this thne yes I would speak to a member of staff that you trust. If you have a childrens centre or Family Centre nearby you could also speak to someone from there...Childrens Centre has Family Support Workers who are great at helping out with this kind of situation.    In my preschool we do not teach sex ed-we play games that involve learning body parts such as Head Shoulders, Knees and Toes, have rules such as my body belongs to me (no one can touch anyone without permission including hugs as teaches them to respect themselves and others), if child asks question we try to answer it appropriatly...and I would be surprised if other preschools were much different to this.    You may want to write a list of who your son has contact with-family, friends, clubs etc as it could be something he's heard when away from the home.    Also have you asked him? Have yu asked your son where he has learnt those words, why he wants to touch other people etc....chidlren at 4 can be surprisingly truthful as often they dont realise its wrong.
rBkLFTqNaa	The best way for children 3-5yrs old to learn another language is through playing, songs and stories. Of course a group with interaction is better but maybe you have a friend that would like to have their child learn English as well. Make it a little play group.   Speak English to the child. It will be frustrating in the beginning esp if he speaks none now... but as you go on.... it will get better. Do not ever revert to whatever language you speak with him now. Get yourself some english versions of whatever he is currently into (Dora, Diego, Hi5)... I have found that Sesame Street was very helpful.... songs, counting, alphabet etc..... you have  to start from basic. Get some english books and read them to your nephew. I taught my son this way, and he speaks English now.... BUT you must make sure they are all english speakers and they must be always be at least 2 of them not counting your son... this way he is forced to try to communicate so that he is not ignored. These things all worked for me, and I have a friend who is currently trying the same tactics here. Good Luck.    |`|wMzCuPoUaa	sing songs (songs for teaching)  Alphabet puzzles  Starfall.com*****(VERY GOOD)  Read to him  jump start CD's  Leapfrog games  pbskids.com (games)|`|5110a754f0890492a3b2aff5b1ac5578aa	John D,  I s English your mother tongue?  Then I suggest you find a native speaker of English to teach him or he will learn YOUR mistakes.      Like you say, "What is the best to teach him learn some English".  What you mean is "What is the best WAY to teach him some English?"    Public Broadcasting has good shows:  Sesame Street, Reading shows, and other bilingual stuff too.

OfPQVR1Naa	I highly recommend the "JumpStart" line of educational software from Knowledge Adventure.  From Jumpstart Pre-School to JumpStart Sixth Grade, they're all good.  I started my son with JumpStart Pre-School the summer before he started Pre-School and continued on with each grade they offered each summer.  It worked wonders.  It really gave him a competitive edge in school and he enjoyed "playing" the modules.      Check them out at:    http://shop.knowledgeadventure.com/Defau...

Have them put all the matching colors together.  Then have them count each number and try to figure out what color has the highest number.  Then have them subtract - like if you have 5 red candies and you take away 1 (let them eat one) how many do you have left?  You can have flash cards of numbers and have them put the correct number of candies on the card to match the number.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Get these cd's:    GREG AND STEVE--number rock  DR.

Numbers-we have a clock jigsaw, flash cards, telephone flash cards (eg: to call doctor press 832739 etc for roleplay).    -Lots of praise and encourgement  -Support them in understanding how they got it wrong rather than just saying "thats wrong".|`|PyOCZiwjaa	Go to some local toy store.

This is problems solving, reasoning and numeracy (maths) and goes towards 'numbers for counting' and also 'calculating'. You can make it harder by asking them to count how many in each bowl-ask how to make bowls have the same number etc.    Then you can take further by labelling bowls with numbers so they have numerals to look at too.    |`|sg272hRpaa	I agree with the first answer.

1jVYfNMbaa	I think the most important issue influencing child's play right now is the family unit.  It's not like the old days when kids played house with a Mommy and a Daddy.

FgFmj8d2aa	We do the same thing for our hallway display case with each room having a month. The teacher responsible for this month did a simple but really cute one...in the middle she made a big turkey and for the feathers, she sent them home to her kid's families and as a family they decorated it and wrote what they were thankful for (as her kids are too young to be able to do it on their own). Along the bottom, she had pilgrim boys and girls with pictures of the kids faces in them. Then around the big turkey, she put little hand turkeys for each of the kids in the class. In my class, we made a collage turkey. Each child got a feather and we used all different types of materials to decorate it...feathers, pom poms, tissue paper, yarn, foam shapes, etc.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	I saw this idea in mailbox magazine.

Then for the feathers in the back of turkey, make them the special Thanksgiving colors such as yellow, red, brown, and orange. Make as many feathers as there are children in the class. (Ex: 15 kids, make 15 feathers.) Then write the kids' names on each of the feathers.    My child development class holds a preschool at our high school and I want to do this for our bulletin board. I just don't know how it will work seeing as we only have four preschoolers lol. Hope this helps! :)|`|WPt9bivgaa	Something around the idea of Thanksgiving? A huge turkey with multi-color feathers.

Corn. |`|1jVYfNMbaa	One of the best bulletin boards we did for our parents was when the children made turkeys out of their hand tracings!  On each of the "Feathers" (fingers) was something the child was grateful for.  The thumb was decorated with eyes and mouth then we added a picture of the child underneath to personalize the board.  We took it down and sent the individual turkeys and pictures home with parents before Thanksgiving break.  Everybody loved it.

f67EfIjeaa	It's really easy. Start by applying first and then they will give you a background test.  You need to have some sort of experience though, and some daycares offer programs for highschool students who are interested in child care. I own a daycare, and for my students in high school they work small hours and need to gain hours in training to stay on board. You can also obtain your CDA at you local Community College and this is usually 2 semesters long. Once you do this you will be certified to work and even own (with the right amount of hours) your own daycare. You need to follow through with all of your CEU credits, once you begin though. It is a lot of fun, you need patience and a very creative mind. Good luck!|`|wMzCuPoUaa	You get your CDA at a 2 year college    You send your resume to the day care you want to work or gain experience  i.e. babysitting    I f you send your resume  to a daycare center no doubt center you will start as a floater(you go where they need you) good experience bc/ you get to see what age you like best.|`|gDHsx5I3aa	It depends on where you live. I would suggest going to a daycare and asking the director what qualifications are needed.    You could also start off volunteering, and they would probably offer you paid work eventually. Generally you get paid better if you have education relating to child care, but if you go for the education while you're working at a daycare they might pay for your schooling.|`|jEmBJrWJaa	go to a place and ask if you can work there

How much vinegar you use depends on how many pennies you have to clean. You only need enough to cover the pennies. In most cases, 1/4 cup will do.  Step  2  Add the salt to the vinegar. You only need about a teaspoon of salt. Stir the mixture until the salt dissolves.  Step  3  Put the pennies into the vinegar and salt mixture. Let them soak for at least 5 minutes.  Step  4  Remove the pennies and rinse them off with water. You can let them dry on paper towels.    grow crystals  Plant lima beans/radish seeds|`|i5tOQGgFaa	Fingerprints    Float and Sink    5 Senses    Why we brush our teeth... egg/coke/etc (I'm sure you can find it on the internet.)    volcano (vinegar/baking soda)---you can do it with the balloon on the bottle as well.

What we do is we pour water in a clear bowl so the kids can see it then we add a few drops of food coloring (Beware of red it may freak the kids out) then we put oil on top and soap (hand soap liquid soap) and show them that they can see all 3 layers clearly. The kids love it they're so amazed. |`|5qicXiniaa	You can try one of these: Diet Coke and Mentos Eruption (also known as a Mentos eruption or a soda geyser) is a reaction of Diet Coke and mint Mentos candies. The eruption is caused by opening a bottle of Diet Coke (typically a two liter bottle) and dropping a Mentos into the bottle. The reaction causes the Diet Coke to foam at a rapid rate and spew into the air. Mint is used instead of fruit-flavor Mentos because fruit flavored Mentos have a smooth coating which slows the reaction. This will teach them about chemical reactions.  Or: Take a pencil and scribble on a piece of paper until you have a nice big black mark. Then rub your index finger in the mark. Your index finger is the one next to your thumb. Now get some tape. The best tape to use is called transparent tape or utility tape. Put a piece of it over your finger, press down, and pull it off. Then put the tape on a piece of paper. Now you can see your fingerprint. This goes to show no 2 fingerprints are the same.    That's just 2 ideas I have now..  |`|dBpmyIduaa	Lots of people had some explosive ideas which might be a lot of fun for your kids but they are not going to understand.

Good Luck!|`|3rbfCKjJaa	What I have always found to be fun with the kids is a take on the old vinegar volcanoe but easier.

tUfUjGdlaa	Why?  -boost self esteem and feel they are important to you  -shows respect  -good role model as if you listen to them they are more likely to listen to you  -to make sure you understand them and can reply appropriately.  -encourage them to speak...if they feel ignored they may start to not bother speaking...this can also lead on to behaviour issues as they try to gain attention anyway possible.  -Support their understanding-if they are asking a question, asking for help etc then you need to know what they are telling you so you can then help them.  -Part of social skills-children learn a lot about turn taking, social skillslike waiting if someones busy, build relationships through speech.    How?  -get down to their level physically.  -eye contact (unless this makes them uncomfortable in which case look in their general direction)  -smile  -speak clearly and in even tone (not too high ro too low)  -use gestures such as pointing to things you're talking about, use makaton if you know it, hand signs such as finger to lip if asking children to quieten down.  -open position-not arms and legs crossed!  -respond to them-if they are smiling you smile, if they are pulling sad face look concerned etc.  -make sure you're facing them-makes it a lot easier to concerntrate on them and shows your listening.|`|92c75202cde0a9b1dbf8095182e197f9aa	when a child talks to you if you give them full attention they know you are interested in them and what they are saying, and will feel confident that you are somebody that they can come and talk to about anything, this helps them with their confidence. the body language, facial expressions etc show that your genuinely interested and they can tell if you are interested or not, when it comes to the language you use, it should always be age appropriate and relating to what the child is telling you. if it is about something serious you must not ask any leading questions, just ask e.g. what happened then, type of thing. when it comes to gestures i'm not totally sure what you mean by this, whether you mean like patting them on the back, holding hands etc, do what you feel is appropriate, you'll be fine, don't panic or over annalise|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Role modeling behavior/good listing   Feel what they are to you saying is important  Self esteem  Create a bond/ connection/ relationship  w/ the child  Validates their feelings of the child  Can find out Information/interest/ what is happening in child's life  social skills/turn taking skills|`|1yGDFTieaa	Brilliant answer from the lady above, so I won't repeat it.     The main reasons, as well as those already mentioned is to actually make the children feel valued.  How would you feel if you began talking to someone, then they ignored you and started speaking to someone else?    A little note you may wish to add in is something like: even if the child begins to talk to you about something irrelevant (trust me, they do - all the time!), it is important not to say "no, be quiet and tell me something about the work", instead, you should say "That's really interesting, but we're doing literacy now, you can come and tell me about your dog at playtime"    Facial expressions include smiling, frowning and raising eyebrows.    
tUfUjGdlaa	Go on this website: www.standards.dcsf.gov.uk and look up document called "inclusion Development Programme-Supporting Children with speech, language and communication needs'...this is really helpful for discussing benefits of speech and language. (Ref code: 00215-2008BKT-EN)    Also look at the Early Years Foundation Stage framework under learning and development: Communication, Language and Literacy http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/eyfs    Why:  -confidence and self-esteem  -build up relationship  -social skills-ability to speak infront of others, put forward ideas and points of view  -suport development through understanding (eg they could be asking you a question, asking for help etc)  -safe guarding-they may disclose info and if you do not give them opportunity to talk you'll miss it)    How in group?  -Ensure that there's a rule "if someone is talking-you are listening"  -Some groups have an object that the speaker holds so children know its their turn.  -adults as rolemodel-dont interupt a child, if someone is talking over someone else remind them to listen, give them opportunity to practise skill.  -Ask questions-asking children questions encourages them to talk.  -Have children who are not so confident, quiet etc near adults to ensure they are heard and encouraged to join in.  -We have circle time everyday-register time (children say yes to their name), discuss calendar/weather chart, look at visual timetable to talk about the day, have show and tell for toys from home then later we have group time such as singing, story (where we ask questions about book) or group games (listening game where children call out what they hear etc)...also during freeplay we may do small group activities but children will naturally come in contact with others to talk to or infront of.|`|dFXCWN95aa	well me being a parent i think its good to listen to all children because its based on your job.  1.find a topic based on your lesson.  2.put them in groups let them talk on their topic discuss their answers  with each other.  3.call them by their groups and listen to what each child have to say and get your opinion.|`|2aa6a351069e388eff62776571ad1ec7aa	It's important because all children have unique thoughts and feelings that they should be allowed to express. Being acknowleged and allowed to express those thoughts and feelings leads to positive self-esteem. It also will help them be willing to speak up and answer in discussions when they are in older grades.     It can be difficult to allow all children in a group to be heard as sometimes there just isn't time for everyone to speak. A teacher can construct activities to allow for everyone to have a chance, such as asking a question that can be answered with a short answer and going around the circle, allowing each child to answer. A teacher also must be aware of who she calls on to speak and try not to call on the same children every time. If that's difficult, she could put children's names on popsicle sticks, draw one, and ask that child to speak (if he/she wants to). Some children don't like to speak up in a group, so the teacher should try to speak to them one-on-one and hear their thoughts and ideas at other times.     Children should also be taught to be good respectful listeners. This means raising hands and waiting to speak, not speaking when someone else is speaking, not laughing at others' ideas (unless it's meant to be funny), etc. |`|kSnFumA4aa	they should to describe them selves before they grown up, or they will be monsters when they describe them selves to the community after then  |`|wMzCuPoUaa	To express themselves/ express ideas  Be part of a group/sense of belonging  Learning to speak in public/groups|`|MRhpYS77aa	We had debating challenges at school which prepared us very well for the future. We were encouraged to speak up from a very young age. It is a good way to do it without everyone shouting at the same time.  |`|1jVYfNMbaa	Be aware of their emotions.  If you know one of them is sad or happy or angry, ask them if they are and why!  If he says angry just ask the group if any of them have ever been angry and let them talk about it, then how to resolve the anger.  This will let the initial child know they're not alone in their feelings and they usually feel better when everything is out in the open!  Suppressing their feelings usually leaves them feeling frustrated which turns into behavior problems. You'll be shocked at some of the conversations this leads to and most are pretty amusing.

fffa34135219a8b99c2b02d14ed8cdc6aa	A good fall activity for that age group is pumpkin and gourd prints.  You would need a couple of small (the mini ones you can get for around a dollar) pumpkins/gourds, paper, and paint.  I use construction paper and paint in fall colors like gold, brown, red, and orange.     Cut the pumpkin/gourd in half.  Then pour a small amount of paint in a shallow dish-I use a regular plastic plate (like the kind you can get at Target in the dollar section).  Then let the kids dip the pumpkin/gourd in the paint and make prints on the paper.       If you use a pumpkin, let the kids help you clean out any goopy stuff inside for an extra sensory experience.  You can also talk about things that happen in the fall as you do the activity.  I love this age because kids are so eager to learn about the world around them :).      You can paint with just about anything around you and 2-3 year olds love it.  Cars, dinosaurs, just about any fruit or vegetable, cookie cutters-just be creative.  It can get messy but kids learn so much from just from doing something out of the ordinary.

o4XXNhGaaa	No, and if they do its another in a long line of why to government aid programs are being horribly taken advantage of.  Get a stanford loan from a bank, low interest and it can be paid back after completion of degree      lol you thumbs down everyone that doesnt want to pay for you to go to college when we had to pay for it ourselves|`|BKG2EPz1aa	I sure hope not, considering it is my tax dollars that pays for unemployment, and you had advance notice that your company was closing. You should be searching for another job instead of taking from the people that are working hard.|`|1aav41JDaa	Probably not|`|TEE4sJscaa	Unemployment will barely provide food for you, let alone cover the basic cost for college. Apply for student federal aid or a student loan at the college. Keep in mind that attending a community college is probably the best thing to do right now. It is one of the least expensive colleges to attend. I know that you want to become a medical biller because of the amount of time it will take to get the certification. But, Please do not forget about doing your general college electives either.

This option now works for me as I home-school my daughter during the day and I work 3-11 shifts.

lXJbuz2Yaa	Buffett now richest person in the world  By Francesco Guerrera in New York      Warren Buffett has overtaken his friend and bridge partner Bill Gates to become the worlds richest person with an estimated fortune of $62bn, according to Forbes magazine.     The Microsoft co-founder, who topped Forbes Rich List for 13 consecutive years, was pushed into third position by Carlos Slim, the Mexican tycoon, whose net worth of $60bn narrowly surpassed Mr Gates $58bn.    EDITORS CHOICE  Buffett throws his lot in with stocks - Oct-18Buffett snaps up NRG stake - Aug-15Insurance woes eat into Berkshire profits - Aug-09Investment sage plays daring game - May-25Buffett trumps bond insurers - May-04Buffett hosts gloriously capitalist weekend - May-04Mr Buffetts consecration as the globes wealthiest person is a further sign that the current financial turmoil is benefiting cash-rich investors looking for assets at bargain prices.    Shares in Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffetts investment vehicle, have risen more than 20 per cent in the year to February 11, Forbes cut-off date for its 2008 Rich List.    After a number of quiet years, in recent months the Sage of Omaha has taken advantage of depressed stock markets and turbulent credit markets to buy companies, invest in undervalued shares, and launch his own bond insurer.     The rise in Berkshires shares boosted Mr Buffetts wealth by $10bn despite the fact that he has begun giving away some of his fortune to four charities, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mr Buffett gives 5 per cent of his shares to charities every July, as part of a pledge to leave 85 per cent of his money to charitable causes.    Mr Gates fortune did rise by $2bn over the year but his ranking was undermined by a slide in shares of Microsoft, which represent a substantial portion of his net worth. The biggest hit came over the past month as investors took fright at the companys decision to mount an unsolicited bid for the internet company Yahoo.     Mr Slims continued success  his fortune has doubled over the past two years  reflected investors appetite for emerging markets. The tycoons main company, the telecoms group America Movil, has seen its shares soar more than 120 per cent since the beginning of 2006.     The spread of global wealth to emerging markets was also seen in Moscows status as the worlds billionaire centre.     With 87 super-rich people living there, it is home to more billionaires than New York. Globally, the number of billionaires has nearly doubled over the past four years, and the collective riches of this years 1,125 billionaires reached $4,400bn, said Forbes.|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	that would depend on your definition of Rich|`|oM6Pem1Waa	Buffet|`|46864596f0eb8c0afb49fb09d1138950aa	Bill Gates?|`|kijIJbBxaa	There is an elite aristocracy that act as a shadow government over our world.

Most children are not that advanced. She does seem to posess a early learning ability. Many children have this ability. However, some lost it during there first few years in schooling, and become avarage. To help keep this ability, encourage learning, and try to get her to start an instrument. If I do say so, stringed instruments are a great way to increase the motor and understanding skills of children.
f02200ae196155b83f406d2d9431911daa	No history, just a child's song to sing.|`|Limt9t5Qaa	It is a song associated with the black plague.    Ring around the rosy = a ring around the collar that people would develop when they were stricken by the plague    Pocket full of posy =  people would fill their pockets with posy to mask the odor that they would emanate because of the disease.    Ashes ashes = their skin would get ashy and start to shed before they died    we all fall down = this was to denote when a person with the plague would finally die.|`|jwftwLBTaa	from what i remember hearing, it has to do with some type of plague, or pox, where children where dying.

zgTsCicNaa	Consider the hour between noon and one o'clock. The hour hand starts at the zero-minute position and moves as far as the five-minute position. Including twelve o'clock itself, when the hour and minute hand coincide, the minute hand will pass a "bit past the hour" point for one o'clock, two o'clock, and so on through eleven o'clock, for a total of twelve times in the first hour when the hour and minute hands can be swapped and still yield a possible time. For the second hour, when the hour hand is between five and ten minutes past the hour, same story -- twelve possible positions. The is true completely through the ten o'clock hour, so the first eleven hours each give twelve swappable positions.    For the eleven o'clock hour, this will still succeed while the minute hand passes between twelve and one, between one and two, and so on, all the way to when it passes between ten and eleven (that is, eleven times). But for the last five minute period, the minute hand will not reach the correct position that the hour hand would be at until the hour hand itself has reached the twelve o'clock position, which of course takes us back to our original, and already-counted, configuration. Thus, the eleven o'clock hour will only have eleven such positions.    Therefore, the total number of swappable positions is (11 * 12) + 11, or 143 different distinct configurations where the hour and minute hand can be swapped and still yield a valid time.    ?|`|PImmA8CJaa	It would seem that the only time the hour and minute hands on a clock could be interchanged without detection would be when both hands are on the same point. Or if the two are the same length.

This question is awesome!|`|pD2MtL9Oaa	You might be able to get out of it if the school grants a waiver to students of other religions.  I think that you might have a hard time though since you are agnostic as opposed to Jewish or Muslim or something like that.    I also am not sure you understand what agnostic means.  Agnosticism is a general acknowledgment that there is a God (not necessarily the Christian God, but a God) and that humans do not have a complete understanding of him/her/it.  If I remember correctly, Agnostics don't believe you can fully understand God.  However, I don't think that there is anything in Agnostic "doctrine" that runs counter to taking a religion course.|`|ThDr2uJBaa	i go to catholic school and by the time my class had done the Catholicism GCSE we were pretty much all atheists or agnostics|`|90J1C8VYaa	Probably not, since it is a private school.

The patient is at more of a risk than you are.  Tips though, are that you need to be good in math, have good memorizing skills, and be good in science.   What most people don't realize, is there is MUCH more to school than learning positions and how to use the machine.  You have to learn radiobiology (effects of radiation on human cells), physics, and much more.  As well as how the image is produced on the film or digital plate.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	very safe -as long as your perform your job correctly.|`|U4NaCjbCaa	it is good job the only one who is at risk are patient|`|AA10461474	I trust you will be attending an accredited program in x-ray. If so, part of the training is safety which is integral to working around radiation. Also, everyone wears a badge which detects the amount of radiation exposure you've had every month. My understanding is that if it ever exceeds a certain amount, than you won't be working where you'll be exposed. My husband has been in x-ray for almost 30 years and has never had his badge indicate overexposure. There are also machines you'll probably be training on that don't involve radiation such as MRI. Its a great field to go into with lots of opportunity for job expansion. Good choice!

MmYXexAyaa	I had the same problem! I was home schooled for grade school and then Gr. 9 and 10 and have never been to public school. Then this year (starting in september) I went to my local high school.  I was so scared but i went not knowing anyone and now I have tons of friends! I had no idea I was missing out on so much! In the halls i now know people and can stop and chat with them! It is great!  I think what you will find is that it is so easy! Having enrolled in an online school for 9 and 10 the work was awful but I didn't know it until I went to public school. I think you will find that it is long some days but you don't do too much. I found it so much easier to hear someone teach it to me then having to teach it myself.  What i enjoyed a lot was the stories that they tell! It is awesome now because i can relate to my teachers and see them in the halls not how it used to be as an icon on my computer!  I have to warn you though I got lost a lot! That might also just be me, but I found nice looking people and asked them directions to my classes. They looked at me funny because I don't look like a Gr. 9 but some even walked me to my classes to make I found it okay!  I never to this day feel bad about being home schooled even though some people have told me that they can tell that I have been homeschooled. I think it might be the way I talk.  Anyways I know this is long but I wanted to help out and it is nice to see that I am not the only one!|`|n5NltZVGaa	Hey, join the club.  Lived through school up to third grade and have homeschooled ever since, after my teacher called me mentally delayed.  I'M NOT!

I could not have had the notion, had my parents refused to follow the conventional schooling path.

df54f1044a5b499adb758231bb8e4a90aa	Usually the more urban areas where there is a concentration of working people is where need more preschools and child care centers are needed. For some working Mothers and Fathers, having their child near their office or workplace is more convienient easier and more reassuring than having the child a hour away in the suburbs in case something should  happen.  Also, urban areas tend to have fewer safe places for children to go. A daycare center would provide such a place.|`|pt6wIlS1aa	Normally I would say locate your preschool near an office park, but with unemployment so high, people don't need anyone to provide daycare because they're at home for their kids until they find jobs.

50WCN0graa	There really isn't an answer for that. Reason being, many children have mental health diagnoses and disabilities and do not receive special education.... in fact, probably most do not receive special education.    A child is only eligible for special education IF the mental illness or disability is negatively impacting their academic success to a significant degree. There is an involved process of intervention and team meetings to determine if this is the case before a school will conduct psychological and academic testing to evaluate the student. Even if the child has a medical or mental health diagnosis, the school must run their own assessment batteries (Multi-Factored Evaluation) to determine if the student is eligible for special ed.    That said, if the mental health or medical diagnosis IS, in fact, significantly, negatively impacting the child's academic achievement, then the school can and should provide special education services..... it doesn't matter what the diagnosis is. If we can't find an appropriate classification (for example: Emotionally disturbed, autism, etc), then we classify the child as "other health impaired" and provide special ed services that way. To classify for special ed as "other health impaired" the child must have a medical or psychological diagnosis of some mental illness or disability, though.
OVmzkRTOaa	My son is now 26 and is living in a supported setting in the north of England. He is able to be fairly independent within a supported framework.  At five he was manically hyperactive, had virtually no language, didn't sleep and had huge food issues!  He made good progress once he was in an autistic unit set in a mainstream school. The unit staff were experienced in working with children on the spectrum and there was a high ratio of staff to a small number of children.  My son has grown into a loving and caring young man who loves working with cattle and horses. He communicates well and is extremely sociable. He remains an extremely vulnerable person as he is very innocent and naive.  The autism never goes away, but skills can develop and changes will occur.|`|yPLS0FeWaa	In all honesty no one can truly answer this question for you, it would depend on the severity of his autism and what type of services he receives to help him. In some cases people on the spectrum have other conditions that co-exist with the autism. If he is diagnosed with autism, get him as much help as you can. With a diagnosis the school should be able to help him more than what they are probably doing now. In our school district (i'm in the US) there are schools that have classes specifically for those on the spectrum and schools that are just for those with autism and related disorders, and they can receive speech and occupational therapy at the school as well, but it's a good idea to try to receive therapy outside of the school too. If diagnosed you'll want to look into him having a speech and occupational therapy assessment. Many on the spectrum have language delays, fine motor skill delays, oral motor skill delays and sensory issues; speech and occupational therapy can help him with these areas. You have to consider all the treatments available for autism, some have to be done on trial basis because sometimes what may work with one on the spectrum may not work with another even if their charateristics are exactly the same. You also have to consider what services does your insurance cover and if you do not have insurance or the insurance does not cover certain services, what can you afford. If you are in the US, as he gets older (16 yrs old sometimes younger) they begin to  give transitional services which focus upon the students needs or interest in such areas as: higher education or training, employment, adult services, independent living, or taking part in the community. They also do transitional planning (14 yrs old sometimes younger) which involves helping the student plan his or her courses of study (such as advanced placement or vocational education) so that the classes the student takes will lead to his or her post-school goals. Many on the spectrum excel in math, music, and arts and have unbelievable memory skills. You'll just have to take it one step at a time. The earlier he is diagnosed and receives help both from within the home and outside of the home, the more likely he can live a normal life as he gets older.|`|2s5WSVbPaa	Our son has just been diagnosed, we don't yet know where on the scale he is but he is only 3 and not yet talking. We have an Autism outreach support worker who comes to our house weekly and when I asked her what his future would be she said don't look at the bigger picture, as much as I share your concerns as to what the future holds it does make sense what she said, you will probably know yourself that your son changes all the time (we can hardly keep up with ours at times) so who is to say he won't be the next Bill Gates!! Keep your targets within reach but make them a challenge, don't underestimate him and fight, fight, fight to get your son the help he needs now.Best wishes.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	Hi hun.    That's a really tough one to judge. They call it the Autistic Spectrum because all children with autism are different.  I have Three sons with autism at varying levels, from sever to higher functioning.  Looking at the future is a normal process when your child is first diagnosed but it's not healthy and will stress you out no end. You have to take a step back and recover first from his diagnoses  and remember that whatever he does, achieves and becomes he will always be your son and will always need you.  If he is at mainstream all he may need is one to one help with his schooling, this will help him focus and adapt to the world around him.    My eight year old has sever autism and has only this year started to speak in sentances and develop his self help skills. I know fully now that he'll never be able to live independently and will always need guidance from another adults.  My other two with austism at lower levels and may well lead prefectly independent lives, but I can't be sure of that now.    Autism is such a complex special need and even now the experts are still learning about it.  Have you contacted any other parents of children with autism? It can feel like you are doing this all on your own but you're not.  They are thousands of parents out there like me, that have the same concerns and worries you do.    Try this link, it's the National Autistic Society. They have councilliors availble  for you to chat to, they don't judge and know what upset, fears and concerns you have.  They can also help you find support in you're local area.    http://www.nas.org.uk/    Good luck hun, remember we are all hear to listen.    xx|`|wgdHd2Eraa	this is from personal family experience: My autistic cousin, Justin, is 18. He still lives at home and probably won't ever live fully live on his own. It is VERY hard, but if you potty train them by the time they are 18, it is possible for them to do a lot more on their own.

He still has 3 more years of high school though, hopefully, he will have learned much more from there.|`|3iYnokfpaa	At the age of 5 it would be difficult to say whether or not your son will become independent. Many people with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome live very independent and fulfilling lives. Others need some one to keep an eye on them day to day. Those who have profound autism will always need full time care. My daughter has Asperger syndrome and is extremely intelligent but has problems socialising, she also fails to do simple tasks such as cleaning her teeth or changing her clothes. I hope when she becomes an adult she will find her self a good career but she will always need some one to help her do simple every day things.

Kids with low-functioning autism will probably need care their entire life. Your state has services that are available for you if that is the case.    Since your child is already 5 and is just going through diagnosis..... and you said "possible diagnosis," that would lead me to believe he is probably "high-functioning" autistic if he is, in fact, autistic. Children with high functioning autism (ie: asperger's, PDD) can most definitely be successful and grow up to be independent, thriving adults. In fact, there are MANY successful individuals with high-functioning autism who excel in the professional world, live on their own, and find love.    I know this must be a tough process for you. He is still young, so you are doing the right thing by intervening now. Take all the services you can get! Best Wishes!|`|X5H8RHH1aa	Hi there,     If your child does have autism you should get care from the authorities. They will tell you all the options available. However, Most adults with learning disabilities have the option of living in a care home for special needs. I'm not sure if this is if they have no one to care for them, but it is available. I shouldn't worry. good luck with everything. Take care.|`|a9e5IZOWaa	i know this is not going to answer your question but i would like to say how impressed i am by how much people know  about autism and the autistic spectrum--they are often well informed and, in fact better informed than most educational professionals.    my son always had problems at school but was eventually diagnosed with As he was 14 at this time and to be honest he had endured 10 years of education horror--a fact which still angers me.  he was eventually offered a place in a suitable school and since then he has flourished. he is now pushing 26 and happy.    i know that special schools are closing but if that's what your son is recommended then fight to get him what he needs..    sorry gone off on a tangent.    you can only wait and see with your son--but autistic children are nothing if not unique. enjoy him

Both degrees are pointless without further education.  With a bachelors in psychology, you won't be able to do anything in the psychology field. Same with a bachelors in mathematics, you won't be able to do anything in that specific field, unless you do mathematics education.  Unless you really just want to do both because you're interested in both, I'd say take the time and money you'd spend doing a double major and go to grad school for whichever you choose.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Math is never a bad idea.

Agad3Oc4aa	Well the truth is usually good.  However, I'm guessing that maybe the parent is right because you are asking this question.  Well one never say anything that will make you lose your job because that parent may go and say you told them.  YOu should tell the parent well in my classroom this is what we do.  then you will focus on positive things that go on in your classroom such as the curriculum.  You can always divert any negative energy from a parent if you discuss what their child  will be learning, it is the reason why they are supposed to be there.  Also discuss how you foster positive relationships between the children as well as the children with the teachers.  In addition, discuss how you would like the parent to be an active particpant in the child's learning and that you look forward to working with the parent in the future in the best interest of the child.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	I would say "Let me tell you about the wonderful things about our day care......." precede to list the great things about the daycare.

UT5HS39Daa	I applied for the FAFSA before I began college (about a year ago), and it's TERRIBLY hard to get any financial aid, much harder than they make it out to be.  It does not depend on what college you want to go to, just how much money your annual household income is.  Assuming you live with your parents, you have to add both of their annual incomes together.  For a family of four or more, the annual household income must be less than 60,000.  For a family of three, it must be less than 45,000.  For a family of two 30,000 or less.  No matter if you live with your parents or not, if you are under the age of 24, they look at your parents income, and they automatically assume they are helping you with paying for college. My advice, if you can not (or even if you can) qualify for financial aid, is to look for scholarships.  Honestly, it's sort of hard to get them as a freshman in college, or even a sophomore, but when you enter your program, and you are done with your core classes, it is much easier to get scholarships.  For example, I am going into nursing, and it is very easy to get tons of scholarships for nursing.  If you are going into education, there are lots of scholarships for that too.  Don't give up on going to college though!! You can always find a way :) Lots of times, colleges will come up with a payment plan for you, so you can pay it all off when you get done.  Good Luck!! :) Hope I helped!!|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Fafsa will let you know what grants you were approved of.

I don't think I might be able to resolve this problem.|`|lV4KoPjHaa	I heard that the Ninth Grade SHSAT test is much harder to get into than the eighth grade one. In the ninth grade one, there are only enough seats to fill the number of people who left the school. Ex: 5 people dropped out of Stuy; therefore, there are only 5 open seats. Very few people leave their schools, so only a few handful seats should be open in any high school.    The ninth grade SHSAT should have trignometry/SOHCAHTOA. There should be questions on quadratic equations, factorials, permutations, etc. I'm not really sure since I didn't take it, but that's what we covering now. Yes, the Ninth grade test has 1000 point system. As for the books, I think I've seen one book with a chapter of Ninth grade level questions. It might have been Kaplan. But very very few books target the Ninth Grade SHSAT. I suggest you look over your old math notes when the test comes. Continue practicing with the passages and logic, but I think the Verbal sections should be upped up and harder to comprehend.    The Summer Discovery Program (one of my backups in case I couldn't get in) is for children who got extremely close to the cut-off score. Such as one or two points off. Not only that, you have to be economically challenged, meaning you get free lunch, speak a foreign language at home, or have some other issue that gave you a disadvantage in comparison. What it is, is a summer program where students go and take tests (or something) and after the summer is over, they get to go to whichever high school they originally picked. No reSHSAT, no repeating anything. You should ask your Guidance Counselor if you can apply, if you think you fit the criteria.      Don't ask Yahoo, ask your guidance counselor. They're supposed to be professionals at this. Good luck.
t729xEslaa	nope money is
W3UYWpxiaa	I think it is a wonderful job.  There is no other job I'd rather do!  Watching kids learn is one of the coolest experiences of my life.  Everyday is the same but different.  You may have the same exact schedule, but the kids attitudes (and mine!) are always different.  Teaching is about finding that balance and helping kids learn.  As for the salary, here beginning teachers make around $30,000 a year.  If i were a single parent it would be hard to manage on, but since I'm single with no kids I do just fine.  I have to budget and spend my money wisely.      I suggest substitute teaching or volunteering in a classroom to find out if you can really see yourself as a teacher.      Good Luck!|`|I1josn3saa	I am not an elementary teacher, but I was studying to be one for a year (and am still an education major).    Many elementary teachers enjoy their jobs, otherwise they wouldn't still be there. One fact that is constantly drummed into you in college is that you cannot teach for any reason but enjoying it or you will not be satisfied at the end of the day.    From what I hear, you are not paid very highly. Wages differ from school to school though, so there's no one answer. One school might pay $40,000; another might pay $60,000.    Before actually pursuing elementary education as a career, spend a few days in a local elementary school. It will give you a feel for what teaching is like and will also help you know whether or not you want to do it. :)

AA11082420	First you need to look at your schedule at school and compare it to you work schedule.  If you are in college you need to make sure your employer is aware of this and plan your work schedule around your classes.  Make sure you leave plenty of time for studying/homework and rest.  If you don't get any rest you won't have the patience/stamina to do well at school or your job.  Try to schedule classes in the morning or at night so you can work the opposite.
AA11093915	Statistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the physical and social sciences to the humanities; it is also used for making informed decisions in all areas of business and government.    Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Both descriptive and inferential statistics can be considered part of applied statistics. There is also a discipline of mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.    The word statistics is also the plural of statistic (singular), which refers to the result of applying a statistical algorithm to a set of data. Thus we speak of employment statistics, accident statistics, etc.        Economics is often described as a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.[1] That is, economics studies how individuals, coalitions and societies seek to satisfy needs and wants. However, the vast number of topics to which the methods of economic theory have been applied has caused some to refer to economics as simply "that which economists do."    The word "economics" is from the Greek words ?? [oikos], meaning "family, household, estate," and ?? [nomos], or "custom, law," and hence means "household management" or "management of the state." An economist is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a university degree in the subject.    Economics has two broad branches: microeconomics, where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and macroeconomics, where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes positive economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from normative economics, which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve subjective value judgments.    Economic reasoning has in recent decades been increasingly applied to social situations where there is no monetary consideration, such as politics, law, psychology, history, religion, marriage and family life, and other social interactions.    The approach to economics that is dominant today is usually referred to as mainstream economics. The more specific definition this approach implies was accurately captured by Lionel Robbins in 1932: "the science which studies human behavior as a relation between scarce means having alternative uses." Scarcity means that available resources are insufficient to satisfy all wants and needs; absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, there is no economic problem. Heterodox economics, including institutional economics, Marxist economics, socialism, and green economics, sometimes make other grounding assumptions, such as that economics primarily deals with the exchange of value, and that labor (human effort) is the source of all value.|`|338bfdec602da3d0e810e79c55f5a351aa	The word 'Statistics' is derived from the Latin word 'Statis' which means a "political state." Clearly, statistics is closely linked with the administrative affairs of a state such as facts and figures regarding defense force, population, housing, food, financial resources etc. What is true about a government is also true about industrial administration units, and even ones personal life.    The word statistics has several meanings. In the first place, it is a plural noun which describes a collection of numerical data such as employment statistics, accident statistics, population statistics, birth and death, income and expenditure, of exports and imports etc. It is in this sense that the word 'statistics' is used by a layman or a newspaper.    Secondly the word statistics as a singular noun, is used to describe a branch of applied mathematics, whose purpose is to provide methods of dealing with a collections of data and extracting information from them in compact form by tabulating, summarizing and analyzing the numerical data or a set of observations.    The various methods used are termed as statistical methods and the person using them is known as a statistician. A statistician is concerned with the analysis and interpretation of the data and drawing valid worthwhile conclusions from the same.    It is in the second sense that we are writing this guide on statistics.    Lastly the word statistics is used in a specialized sense. It describes various numerical items which are produced by using statistics ( in the second sense ) to statistics ( in the first sense ). Averages, standard deviation etc. are all statistics in this specialized third sense.    The word statistics in the first sense is defined by Professor Secrit as follows:-    "By statistics we mean aggregate of facts affected to a marked extent by multiplicity of causes, numerically expressed, enumerated or estimated according to reasonable standard of accuracy, collected in a systematic manner for a predetermined purpose and placed in relation to each other."    This definition gives all the characteristics of statistics which are (1) Aggregate of facts (2) Affected by multiplicity of causes (3) Numerically expressed (4) Estimated according to reasonable standards of accuracy (5) Collected in a systematic manner (6) Collected for a predetermined purpose (7) Placed in relation to each other.|`|AA11244170	Econometrics

Before we proceed, what is denotation or denotative meaning? Denotation refers to the literal meaning of a word, the "dictionary definition." For example, if you look up the word snake in a dictionary, you will discover that one of its denotative meanings is "any of numerous scaly, legless, sometimes venomous reptiles,having a long, tapering, cylindrical body and found in most tropical and temperate regions."     Since you're not looking for connotation, let's proceed.    CHEAP - cheap   Audio pronunciation of "cheap" ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (chp)         ***           1. Relatively low in cost; inexpensive or comparatively inexpensive.           2. Charging low prices: a cheap restaurant.         ***           1. Obtainable at a low rate of interest. Used especially of money.           2. Devalued, as in buying power: cheap dollars.     3. Achieved with little effort: a cheap victory; cheap laughs.     4. Of or considered of small value: in wartime, when life was cheap.     5. Of poor quality; inferior: a cheap toy.     6. Worthy of no respect; vulgar or contemptible: a cheap gangster.     7. Stingy; miserly.    INEXPENSIVE - inexpensive   Audio pronunciation of "inexpensive" ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (nk-spnsv)  adj.        Not high in price; cheap.  adj : relatively low in price or charging low prices; "it would have been cheap at twice the price"; "inexpensive family restaurants" [syn: cheap] [ant: expensive]    Therefore, these terms are synonymous because as you can see in one of the definitions of cheap it means inexpensive and vice versa. Most people sometimes opt for inexpensive rather than cheap because of its connotative meaning.

0a0df8302296db03c2c6cf8fadc13928aa	SISTEMA DE INVENTARIO PERMANENTE    Por medio de este sistema la empresa conoce el valor de la mercanca en existencia en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de realizar un conteo fsico, por que los movimientos de compra y venta de mercancas se registra directamente en el momento de realizar la transaccin a su precio de costo.  Las empresas que adoptan este tipo de sistema deben llevar un auxiliar de mercancas denominado "Krdex", en el cual se registra cada artculo que se compre o que se venda. La suma y la resta de todas las operaciones en un periodo da como resultado el saldo final de mercancas.   El "Krdex" puede ser PEPS (primeras mercancias en entrar, primeras en salir), o UEPS (ultimas mercancias en entrar, primeras en salir.    MTODOS PARA LA FIJACIN DEL COSTO     Los mtodos ms utilizados para fijar el costo de las mercancas de la empresa son el promedio ponderado, UEPS o FIFO y PEPS o LIFO, a continuacin se presentan sus fundamentos y un ejemplo de su aplicacin:     1. Mtodo del promedio ponderado  Este mtodo consiste en hallar el costo promedio de cada uno de los artculos que hay en el inventario final cuando las unidades son idnticas en apariencia, pero no en el precio de adquisicin, por cuanto se han comprado en distintas pocas y a diferentes precios.   Para fijar el valor del costo de la mercanca por este mtodo se toma el valor de la mercanca del inventario inicial y se le suman las compras del periodo, despus se divide por la cantidad de unidades del inventario inicial ms las compradas en en el periodo.     2. Mtodo PEPS o FIFO  Aplicndolo a las mercancas significa que las existencias que primero entran al inventario son las primeras en salir del mismo, esto quiere decir que las primeras que se compran, son las primeras que se venden.    3. Mtodo UEPS o LIFO  Este mtodo tiene como base que la ltima existencia en entrar es la primera en salir. Esto es que los ltimos adquiridos son los primeros que se venden.|`|AA10664023	PEPS es un sistema de control para el almacn que significa "PRIMERAS ENTRADAS, PRIMERAS SALIDAS" esto es que vas a sacar del almacn lo primero que recibiste.

059dbda5b96db8a8c36cd5a2814e52d8aa	I'm going to assume -- because it seems fairly obvious -- that you're going to cheat and turn in this essay as your own work. (If this is not the case, blame it on the clarity of your question.)     Now, lots of people will tell you that if you're cheating, you're really depriving yourself of a chance to learn valuable skills, and that ultimately, you're going to be a victim of your own laziness. While this is certainly true, I'm not going to emphasize this point because quite frankly, I don't care what happens to you.     Here's why: Cheaters hurt honest students. Most teachers try to set their classes up so that the average grade is a C. If your grade goes up thanks to cheating, someone else who doesn't cheat will -- in the long run, even if the class isn't officially on a curve -- see his or her own grade drop. If half of a class cheats on a multiple-choice test, so they all do well, the teacher will just make the next test harder -- something that doesn't much affect the cheater, but which is murder to the honest student. (Before I was a teacher, I was a student. Now I realize that one math class I took in high school was insanely difficult precisely because half the class was cheating. At the time, I thought people were cheating because the class was hard, but there's a feedback loop involved.)    In short, the best reason to not cheat isn't so you can learn, but so you can avoid becoming a solipsistic jerk who hurts the people around him.    Really: How badly do you want to be a jerk?|`|AA11935119	You will totally love this book:    A Short Course in Kindness  by Margot Silk Forrest    http://www.margotsilkforrest.com/    L.M.

bcd1d44e8f8feee5fa7ac6fe2ce31acdaa	Maybe you get stressed during the tests?  I had a lot of the same problem in school where I could do the work, but tests were not so good, especially in math.  I talked to my teacher to get extra help with test prep (my school actually had a free class) and some tutoring.  Yeah, I had to go early in the morning or stay late, but it helped.  Also, just talk to your teacher!  If you have test anxiety, maybe you could take your test in the library or in another classroom where you won't feel as pressured.  Or if you need an extra 10 min so you won't be pressed for time, your teacher might write you a pass for your next class.  Good luck!

r5Mxre6Saa	In Reply to: Get your goat posted by Janice on February 25, 2000     : I know "get your goat" means to annoy someone, but does anyone know the derivation of this phrase?     There is one theory, espoused by H.L. Mencken among others, that ties the phrase to the world of horse racing. It used to be common practice, goes this theory, to stable goats with race horses, trainers believing that the mere presence of the goats would help keep the excitable thoroughbreds calm. If an unscrupulous gambler were to arrange for the removal of a certain goat from a certain horse's stall the day before a race, the horse might be so flustered by the absence of its hircine pal that it would lose the race. The gambler would thus have "gotten the horse's goat."     Unfortunately, the first occurrence of the phrase in print, according to the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, was in 1908. Since goats are no longer (if they ever were) housed with race horses, the practice must have arisen near the beginning of the 20th century -- and been abandoned shortly thereafter -- for that theory to be true.     A more likely origin of the phrase lies in an earlier (1904) citation in the Random House dictionary, for "goat" as prison slang for "anger." I think this may be the key. After all, goats do, with much provocation, get angry. To bring out the "goat" in someone may take some doing, but will eventually have dramatic results.

AA11039109	Everybody takes the same thing in med school.  You don't specialize until after med school when you do your internship and residency.    Getting in med school is so competitive that they can be very demanding.  They want A's in almost everything, certainly in the courses that count, like biology, chemistry, and organic chemistry.  A pediatrician friend of mine got a single B in biology and that one grade kept him out of the best med schools.  Getting a C would have kept him out of all of them.      Unlike undergraduate college, extracurricular things don't count.  Maybe a little time volunteering in a hospital so that you know you don't pass out at the sight of blood or freak out at death.  Any other extras raise the question of why you did that instead of studying harder.|`|7Ftglo8daa	career and education  http://careeroverview.org/

8SmMYdBLaa	Don't worry! They know that you don't know all of the math (none of the other 7th graders do either!) The scores that will qualify you for this program are not scores that would usually be considered "good" ACT scores. They are scores that are good for your age, which takes your current level of education into account.     PLEASE don't spend the next day trying to cram all that math into your head, there's no way you could understand it all (and there's no reason that you SHOULD understand it all yet!) and all it will do is stress you out. Absolutely nothing happens if you don't get a high score on the test. Colleges will never see it (either way) and if you don't qualify for the program, that's all that happens. Maybe disappointing, but it won't impact any other area of your life!     Taking the ACT this young is a great opportunity for you to take it with less pressure than in high school when it counts. If nothing else, this will help you become more familiar and comfortable with the test so you will be more prepared when you take it later.     The best thing you can do for yourself is get a good nights sleep before test day and eat a good breakfast before the test.
c8d02azcaa	It sounds to me like she is lazy.  If she neglects to check the childrens hair and it is her duty, what else is she neglecting?|`|QWFvw2yvaa	thats...gross.... make the teacher do it... its her fault.... yuck...|`|C7FiLfogaa	Not demanding. Yes, I would be annoyed. Try to sue her. Try using another shampoo. That might help. Head and Shoulders?|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	You say you own a daycare. Do you thoroughly check each child EVERY DAY? That would take so much time! And ......... many parents would take offense to this. A casual stroking the hair is what my school recommends. "hey, how are you today" as you tossle their hair. Of course, this misses some cases. Head lice is annoying, but do not blame the teacher. Not all parents check their kids, and many parents try to 'hide' their child's head lice. The teacher probably shares your frustrations. Some families are repeat offenders, and do not follow instructions to completely remove head lice. This cause issues for the teacher. And of course, she too has to deal with the family blaming her for not preventing the lice outbreak.|`|hNKETYrMaa	I don't really feel like it's the teacher's job to search all the children for lice.  Her job is to teach your child.  YOU also have the power to prevent it.  I'm assuming you have less children than she does students.  As a parent it should be your job to check your own child for lice.  If you have enough time to watch the teacher not check your child correctly, then you have enough time to check your child yourself.|`|FgFmj8d2aa	First of all...to Vaatirocks, how exactly is it the teacher's fault? She's not the one who came in with head lice, so it's about as much her fault as it is yours. Secondly, it's really not the teacher's job to be checking for lice. But if she didn't want to do it, she should have spoken up so that someone qualified could be called in to do it the right way.    To answer the question, no, you're absolutely not being too demanding at all. A few months back, one of the boys in my preschool class had a sister who got head lice (she doesn't even go to our school anymore and he was kept home, though he didn't appear to be affected). The secretary brought down our doctor immediately, at the beginning of nap time, to check every child and teacher's head (we have anywhere from 17 to 20 kids on any given day), and even had to wake a few up to make sure that nobody had been infected.     Head lice spreads very quickly, especially in a school/preschool/childcare seeting and is hard to get rid of. I would think that the nurse would be the one responsible for checking the children, since they know how to check properly, but if a certain teacher was made responsible  for checking, she should be doing so thoroughly for each child in the class.|`|CdCe3dvUaa	make her check! its not only affecting your kid, but the other 11 in his class. it's HORRIBLE to have head lice! it could also spread to other members of your family, and it's hard to comb out all the eggs that they lay. if she would only check 12 kids thouroghly each day, she could spread it to more and more people outside of preschool. God Bless!|`|217f45ca54f30cb63e99ed07b568da05aa	head lice should be the nurses job not the teacher. it happens. kids that get head lice either have extremely clean hair. they can't stick to oily hair and don't like it. (that is why most dark skinned people don't get lice they grease their scalps and hair daily). or like in chickens have sick livers. instead of pouring poison onto your kid's head get livaplex from standardprocess.com it is an otc that will strengthen the liver and the lice die faster. they also will not come back unlike with poison. my daughter had a bad case of lice gotten from a school uniform store. poured 5 bottles of poison onto her scalp before a doctor recommended a more natural way of gtting rid of them. i have complete faith in the product. good luck
sjOelwhhaa	A participle is an adjective that comes from a verb.  One common one is "married."  That comes from the verb "marry."  But used as a participle, it can function as  an adjective:  A married woman sold that house.  You can see any adjective could replace "married."  "Happy,"  "pretty," "smart," etc.  The verb in that sentence is "sold," and the subject is "woman."    All participles are either past participles, like "married," or present participles, like "crying," for example.  It comes from the verb "cry."  The crying baby disturbed the church service.  Baby is the subject, and disturbed is the verb.  A participial adjective describes "baby."    The past participle also is part of every passive verb.  We add "be" and change the verb to the past participle.  Example:  Active sentence--The mailman brings the mail every day.    The passive equivalent:  The mail is brought by the mailman every day.   Brought is the past participle of bring.
OHkVsb1Laa	My grand-daughter is interested in this field! She went to her local police department and spoke with someone in that department about the best preparations she could make for this field!    Rather than sharing what they told her would be good preparation, I will tell you that they said each police department can vary some in what they want.    So, I suggest you go to the LA police department and ask! If you have a department closer to where you live, ask there as well. Check a bunch of them in the area!    Then you will know what they are all looking for and will be prepared no matter which one you eventually apply for.    But don't neglect general subjects! Sometimes people (like me) have a direction they are headed, then they learn something that makes them change their direction. If this happens to you, you will appreciate a good solid base of basic courses that makes the change easier.    It is important to check around as you study to be sure you are still interested in your chosen path. You will be spending lots of time at work, so you want it to be something that is enjoyable and fulfilling for you. The easiest time to change your mind is before you have put 5 or 10 years into that field!    You are so smart to check into what will work best for your chosen career, that I am sure you will find your way quite easily!|`|hwqwNKHyaa	South Dakota has some excellent universities for homicide - SDSU, USD...

So start firm and make sure they know you know who is the head of department and head teacher. They need to know you are part of the system, not someone random person who knows jack about the school.   Make sure you know about leaving the room and other trivial things, because they will test you on this. Make contact with a regular teacher in the next classroom so you can send misbehaving kids to them if neccessary. Know the timetable, never forget the time a lesson ends or you will lose all credibility. Even though it is new, you must give the impression that you know everything about the school and it's rules.   Have spare pencils and erasers and be prepared to let them go, it's not worth the hassle to get them back. Make sure the cover work is in place. If you don't understand it then just wing it. Have the keys that you need - a teacher who cannot open the store room looks like a fool.   Make sure your classroom is unlocked for you, or have the key. Be there before the pupils and know whether they come straight into the room or wait outside. If you get this wrong then you are doomed from the start. Make sure you have all the appropriate registers.  Sorry to sound so harsh, but unfortunately I am the voice of experience.

Come in with your own copies in several grade levels.  Word searches and math puzzles can be found on line.  You will have to pay to  have your own copies made,     Most school supply stores will have books of activities for substitutes to use, or sponge activities.      I found to keep my sanity, I would tell a student to do something once, if they do not comply, then write them up and send them to the office.  Be sure to get some discipline referral slips before you even enter the room.      Good luck.

I bet you only have to take test every chapter you read in a text book, but in college we have to take a test over 5 and 6 chapters at a time. Believe it or not school is really easy once you study.

6EOcwRkAaa	Don't get discouraged~ it does seem to take FOREVER in the beginning, but you will get much faster.  You are required to "dot all your i's" in the beginning and it is very awkward. (Remember learning to drive?-now you don't think about all the little steps) You will get into a groove.  Don't try to invent new lesson plans. Use the teacher's manual as a guideline- it  will give you way too much, but just ask your cooperating teacher what sections she uses and what parts to drop. Even a veteran teacher takes longer to do lesson plans when a new textbook is adopted- just think -ALL the textbooks are new to you. Maybe just concentrate on one creative lesson plan a week. You, and your students, will get bogged down with all the cutesy (albeit fun) stuff.  Teaching is not about the spectacular lesson plan- it is the classroom management- you need to focus on that.  Usually the university supervisor will be more impressed if you can handle the students, appear confident (even if you are shaking inside!), and are prepared for your lesson. Just be sure you fulfill their requirements - objectives stated, visual aid, etc.     Student teaching is exhausting, but the bonds you make with your first students- both of you learning! So special!|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	Print out a pro forma and write by hand, it is much faster. It takes ages at the start, maybe 30 minutes planning for an hours lesson. When you have done it more it will take 10 minutes tops. You will be fine after a while when you understand how boring and repetitive these things are. They are mostly for show and bear little relation to the reality of  lessons. Learn to work the system, because it is all superficial. Don't worry about being original or creative. If every lesson plan looks like same, that doesn't matter as long as you have met all the criteria.

The second way is to have a mnemonic./|`|gHRbi3c5aa	The best way is to learn it the way you learn best - are you a visual? if you are then writing it out again OR adding pics OR designing mnemonics or short poems can help    If you are auditory, then reading aloud to yourself will help but if you find this boring (then you're probably not auditory  or you just find your own voice boring) then use someone else . .  put it on tape and listen to it    If you are kinaesthetics then you need touch and movement so you might find it's better to write it up but do it as a flow or anything that really makes you connect with the material. Some people make lists and then dance while they're reading their lists. Be creative.     Lists are great for revision - because they bring order - for something to be ordered means it is understood on at least one level.    Spider graphs are also great - they show ideas/ events/ chemicals etc and their connection to others|`|XAi3qacOaa	My teacher used to and still does say, "If you know it, you won't have to remember it." So therefore, study hard, and intake the information you need to. If you know what is expected, and you intake it and store it in your mind, knowing that you know it off the top of your head, without having to scramble through your brain to find the answer, you won't have a problem with the exam at all.    Good luck!|`|nJtJvL7Naa	Write them down and read them over and over again.  Sing them.  Lol I know that's weird, but it works for me!  Excercise while you are memorizing.

Whew it's time to get out of this crappy gangster infested school.|`|AUkuRqP9aa	To eighth graders: Consider the type of person you are before making your decision to go a specialized high school. Are you already an achiever in middle school, or are you middle of the class that got lucky on the SHSAT? Stuyvesant (and I can probably assume the same for the majority of specialized high schools) isn't really that worth going to. The competition is cut-throat and the workload is intense. I'm not trying to discourage you from going to a great school, but do you think you have a chance of being top of the class at a specialized high school? If not, you'll be one of those mediocre students in a specialized h.s. who suffer for 4 years and end up going to a local college, or less than prestigious one (by mediocre I mean low 90 average; only about 30-50 students per grade get above 95 in Stuy w/ a real shot at a prominent college; if you can't make 90, as most in Stuy cannot, then you have almost no chance). Only the top 50 or so students really make it to the prominent colleges. So think deeply about how you want your next 4 years to be. It can be really hard with a really high chance of being outperformed (specialized h.s.) or it can be really easy and you'll probably graduate top of your class with a good shot at a good college (nonspecialized h.s.).    Extra things you might want to consider: Chances are you will wake up at 6AM and commute for at least an hour, standing. Homework takes forever, especially when piled on top of extra-curriculars. The majority of good students (94+) stay up really late, past 12AM, sometimes to 2 or 3, and some don't sleep. Those who sleep at 10PM and wake up at 7-8AM have it too good and chances are they have a low 80 average.  A good 50% of the teachers are either foreign (with an incomprehensible accent) or incompetent. It usually comes down to heavy textbook studying and cramming.|`|LVDkeutNaa	bronx 533. lol.

DaAravzOaa	Notecards are my best friend.  They sound really corny, because we were always taught to use them in elementary and middle school, but they really do work!  I usually take out my class notes form that day, my notes from my reading for homework, or a worksheet on the subject, and write down the word and the definition for the word on each notecard.  At CVS you can actually get a notecard holder for like $2 or $3 that has dividers in it - that way it is easy to organize your notecard for each subject.  You can write down more than vocab words on these cards - I sometimes write the date of something and on the back I write what happened on that date, or where a country is located, etc.  Even just writing out the word and the definition helps me to study and remember what it means.  This doesn't take long either (just think: you are the only one seeing these, you can write as messy as you want!) and you can do this just about anywhere: the bus ride home, in bed at night, in front of the tv, etc.  It's nice because the day before the test you can just pop these out and give yourself a couple quizzes on the words.  Also, give yourself some breaks!  It;s not good to cram for a test 2 hours before you have to take it - your head will hurt and you're just gonna feel like crap.  The day before the test, study for a 1/2 hour, 45 min with your note cards, then give yourself a break (like have a snack, watch tv, check your e-mail, etc). for a good 20 minutes or so.  Then resume your studying, and continue this pattern.  This helps you to not feel like a zombie, helps you to relax during studying, and also helps you to get away form the work briefly.  Also, the day before the test I read through all of my notes, worksheets, and essays.  Don;t study the things you know like the back of your hand or things you know won't be on the test,.  I just read through all of my work and make sure I STUDY the important  facts I know will be on there.    This may sound like a lot and think it will take a log time, but it really doesn't.  Just make sure you do the notecards and review your notes and whatnot and it shouldn't take long at all.|`|0dqfwKk7aa	first you need to set a time frame to study and stick with it. Review your notes, reread material, and think like a teacher.. as you review think about how or what your teacher might ask you on a test.  Focus on the big idea.     You also need to be aware of the type of learner you are.  I'm a visual learner and I have to see everything in print.  If i have to memorize vocab I have to write it over and over.  But, if you're a auditory learner, you might have to say the word over and over.|`|dq6E0qHOaa	the best way is to review what you did in class each day. study for fifteen minutes solid for each subject such as no food, drinks or snacks

47a13fa1a46c4511dc92b72ffaee1a6baa	She never listened. She told me she could take care of herself, but that didnt work. It led to her worsening habits .    Life's is a run-on sentence..|`|oYSDEWrfaa	I would probably re-phrase the statement to be a little more clear.    Example:     She refused my advice, however despite her reassurance that she could take care of herself  her habits only continued to worsen.  (I am not sure if you should put "take care of herself" in quotations, I guess it depends what type of writing you are doing and whether you are quoting her exact words).    Example:     She refused my advice and would not listen to me, she had assured me that she could take care of herself but her habits only continued to worsen as a result.     Example: She refused to listen to me and her habits only continued to worsen, despite her attempts to reassure me that she could take care of herself.     You can also divide that up into two clear concise sentences if you feel more comfortable.    Example:    She did not listen to me and refused to take my advice. She had reassured me that she could take care of herself, but her habits only continued to worsen.    Good luck!|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Because she never listened to me and told me she could take care of herself, her habits worsened.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	She didnt listen and told me she could take care of herself but that didnt work because her habits worsened.    not sure if you have to keep this structure but I would word the whole thing this way:    I offered to help her but she didn't listen saying she could take care of herself.  It didn't work because her habits worsened.|`|dBensSCmaa	thats good|`|EQ27zn0saa	She didn't listen and told me that she could take care of herself.

XktkAZVfaa	Try not to be nervous! You might be, but remember that everyone is just as nervous as you. You will most likely be fine after the first day.    Try to make friends with people in your classes and the people you will live around. Just make sure they arn't the kind of friends that will use you to answer their homework questions 24/7 or are bad influences in any way. Friends keep you sane.    Don't buy your books until after the first week, because sometimes the recommended books are not even used, or you might end up dropping a class.    Make sure you finish homework before having any fun! A lot of people seem to forget that rule lol. I would suggest using the school library for schoolwork in the morning, where its quiet and you can get everything done well and fast. Then after that and your classes, enjoy your night without any work/worries.|`|UAGEJCkDaa	Here's some totally cool advice....    http://www.mycollegecalendar.org/explore...

Based on local pricing:    100 (that's 100 pounds for all you uninformed) would get you approximately 146 lbs of whipped cream.    That same 100 would get you approximately 1 ton (2000 lbs) of river rock.    SO... Obviously 100 of rocks would be way heavier than 100 of whipped cream.|`|PwGZdVWHaa	they weigh the same, both 100 pounds.

hyHvG1Olaa	A "Teaching Plan" is the organized model for what a teacher is going to teach for a particular lesson.  The first link has the following information as well as a template ...    1. Objectives and Goals  The lesson's objectives must be clearly defined and in lined with district and/or state educational standards.  2. Anticipatory Set  Before you dig into the meat of your lesson's instruction, set the stage for your students by tapping into their prior knowledge and giving the objectives a context.  3. Direct Instruction  When writing your lesson plan, this is the section where you explicitly delineate how you will present the lesson's concepts to your students.  4. Guided Practice  Under your supervision, the students are given a chance to practice and apply the skills you taught them through direct instruction.  5. Closure  In the Closure section, outline how you will wrap up the lesson by giving the lesson concepts further meaning for your students.  6. Independent Practice  Through homework assignments or other independent assignments, your students will demonstrate whether or not they absorbed the lesson's learning goals.  7. Required Materials and Equipment  Here, you determine what supplies are required to help your students achieve the stated lesson objectives.  8. Assessment and Follow-Up  The lesson doesn't end after your students complete a worksheet. The assessment section is one of the most important parts of all.    The following sites also have information on writing teaching plans ...  http://k6educators.about.com/b/2007/07/3... http://frank.mtsu.edu/~mbalacha/partsofa...

Assuming she has a HS diploma she will need to do some form of Level 3 course to get into uni. If she has a few AP she can apply directly to uni.    She has to apply to uni / college and be accepted before she can get a visa and the visa will tie her into one particular college.    She will get no financial aid. In fact she will have to show she has enough money to fund her course before she enters the country.    She will have to pay international fees which at uni are 8-10K a year.

If you did congrats...Well theyre alot of things to think about like the commute...(I live in Brooklyn and I hate travelling so I would choose whichever is close to you)BUT (theres always a but) Brooklyn Tech and Midwood are very good schools...(Both were placed on the top highschools in NYC list). But I live 5 blocks away from Midwood and I know that school is crowded and some of the kids there are snotty (NOT ALL OF THEM SO ANYONE FROM MIDWOOD DONT GET MAD)... Remember B-Tech is a specialized Highschool and Both are Good Highschools but I would say Brooklyn Tech!!    Congrats Maybe you should do some research and choose for yourself but thats just my opinion!!

It's painfully grueling work and study and only for those who are really at home w/ business, not someone looking for more money or a steadier job, sadly.    There's a huge difference between business, finance and economics, so really look into these before you make a decision.    Everything is expensive here, that's true.  Are you living near FIDM?  If you are, I understand it, but if not, I don't see why you can't find something relatively cheap.  I live in downtown (Little Tokyo to be exact) and I only pay $570 to live alone in a very quiet youth hostel.    Yes, your tuition would be far far far cheaper if you were a resident.    You are welcome to e-mail me if you have any further questions.  I don't want us to lose another Angeleno!|`|vZqYUZk1aa	sorry i missed this question---read my answer on your next question  this might sound really strange but whatever  i can tell you all about this... a way you get free education in the USA and more.  i gave you my info on the next question you asked    David in Jesus care and prayer|`|SbsB0bwEaa	if u want a guaranteed 40k+ job coming out go with business and do accounting. if you go to ucla or berkley you will get 50k coming out

Try to write and listen at the same time, don't put your mind into writing because you can always read your notes again later. Ask your teacher to slow down so you can copy everything you need down.|`|AA10566881	Can you possibly get a Livescribe pen?  They record what's going on as you make notations.  Later, you tap on the word you wrote at a given time, and you can hear (through the earbuds) everything that was said.  For example, you are listening to the Gettysburg Address.  You write:  Gettysburg    Later, tap on the word Gettysburg, and hear the whole thing!      If you are not a fast note taker, then you might want to look for one on Ebay or Amazon.

UAGEJCkDaa	If your parents will not file a tax return:     Answer Not going to file to the Have your parents filed a tax return? question. You will then be taken to the income earned from work question.   Enter any income that your parents earned from a job that is listed as taxed on a W-2 form. Answer only those income questions that apply to your parents from that point on.     Under special circumstances the colleges (not the FAFSA peeps) will consider your FAFSA complete and will calculate your EFC.  Your parents refusing to fill out their taxes is NOT considered a special circumstance.  So get their W-2s and enter their info. for them and contact the Financial Aid Officer at the colleges you apply to ask them to consider your FAFSA complete.      Good luck!|`|G1a8nFJHaa	You can't file without your parents tax information. You're out of luck

So yes, you're right in thinking that if you need a quick decision, you should call your school's financial aid office. Good luck!

The 4 seasons are caused because at some point the earth is closer to the sun (summer) and sometimes it is further away (winter). Despite what many people believe, the Earth goes around the sun in more of an oval shape than a circle.    for the 2nd one answer 'b' is correct. Back then they thought the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us.|`|6XVIGd3Oaa	The First One is A, FOR SURE.  I'm the biggest space nerd ever.      And The Second One, is A too.  Because, many scientists did believe in Copernicus's ideas and theories,    B is true too.  Because In Early Astronomy, The "Earth Centered Solar System" was a widely accepted theory, but soon we found out that we ARE NOT the center of the universe,  The sun is.    The Earth's movement around the sun takes 365 days or 1 year, It takes 24 hours to rotate on our axis, which causes day and night, aswell as seasons, because the axis is tilted.  C is not true.    The Earth's axis and equator ARE NOT THE SAME,  So D isn't true either.    Hope I helped!  Astronomy is fun!    Recap:  1. A    2.

BVwDoV81aa	German is not a 'flexible' language like french italian or spanish. To go to study is one thing but to study without being fluent I would suggest would be very difficult.    We can all get by on holiday in a foreign country for a week or two with a phrase book. This would be different, you'd be expected to keep up, join in, no exceptions would be made for course work submissions and for most in 2nd years the pressures can be heavy enough. Would you really enjoy yourself enough ? Its tiring mentally struggling to understand and do the translation and comprehension work without then being away from home and all the new friends stuff to contend with too. The language is an added obstacle.     If you'd had 6 years of german instead of 6 years spanish I'd have said go for it without any hesitation. I have my doubts unless you are very stubborn or very keen either way.     Why not go year 3 and spend year 2 on a hot house german language tutoring course ?    best wishes|`|RvVvaVsAaa	i lived in germany for 2 years and yes its pretty hard to live there without knowing too much german. you wont survive. and they DONT like it when you ask them to speak in english for you, its sort of an insult that you didnt take out the time to learn some of their language yet you did research living there. i wouldnt go there untill you know more of the language!|`|VPUGZiQFaa	Study in Germany without fluent-german is not a good idea.

Lol last minute studying seems like a good idea, but will one more practice test really help? And if you stay up all night studying, you'll be so tired, you'll probably forget it all. Trust me, I've tried that method :D    Eat. I was starving the first time I took the SATs, which really made concentrating hard.  The ACTs are even longer, and with less breaks, so definitely eat before.  I mean, the first section is like...i dont remember, but more than an hour i know lol. So yeah, if you are hungry at first, you won't be eating for a while.  That goes for going to the bathroom too. It seems obvious, but I'm reminding you just in case, since I doubt you want to realize 10 minutes in that you have to pee really bad :P  Oh, back to food, bring a snack. What? I like my food. lol.    Bring lots of sharp pencils. OH don't forget they can't be mechanical.  There is always the one person who brings a mechanical pencil. Don't forget a calculator. Good eraser. Should be obvious stuff, but it tends to be the obvious stuff you forget.      Oh, definitely don't forget your ticket and id.  Actually, go over the list today and put everything you need in a bag tonight. My ACT was a nightmare...I hadn't prepared at all, and 5 minutes before I have to leave I'm running around looking for pencils and a bag...and then I almost forgot my id. it was horrible.    If you get stuck on a question, skip it. really. its not worth your time...all questions are worth the same.  Go back to it if you have time. I've wasted so much time on stupid questions.  Also, a lot of times its just something that you can't remember at the moment, so sometimes coming back, you suddenly remember.  And don't forget that you don't get penalized for wrong answers like in the SAT.  So when you have literally 5 seconds left and 10 questions left (I hope that won't happen to you lol) go to all the leftover ones and the ones you skipped and bubble anything in. I've actually gotten a few right like that lol.     Mainly, though, just relax.  If you're nervous, you tend to not read properly, and get confused. A lot of times, just taking a couple deep breaths and looking at the question again have been so helpful...I can calmly think of what I've learned, and a lot of times, its quite obvious.  And remember, if you don't do well, you can take it again :) lol I know thats not great, but my point is it's not the end of the world.      :D good luck, really, and just think...soon, you'll be done with all this sh!t and can go on to months of college essays!! Lol ;)

Just realize that before you know it, it'll be over and you'll be planning your future (it feels like just yesterday I was a freshman too). You realize once you turn 18 that college is REALLY important for your future, so just always work hard and don't give into stupid intentions.

Good Luck in your search ...|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	not enough. teachers don't get paid crap and most have a second job and limited benefits. what ever you do, don't major in english or art, they are worthless degrees and lead to teaching jobs anyways. look for a job that you know will be exciting, fun, and will pay enough.|`|SwyxANphaa	Anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000, depending on the state and district.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	The teacher salaries depends on which state you are in, which city, and which district.     California is around 35-40k a year before Taxes.  Colorado doesn't pay that well.  Chicago, IL pays pretty well after about 5 yrs.  Some of the less populated northern states pay pretty well. Montana, etc... because sometimes it's difficult to find teachers who want to be in small towns.     If you want to be a teacher then what you really need to think about is whether or not you are the kind of person who wants to help others learn. It isn't about the money. Can you see yourself going through years of teaching, helping poor kids, kids with disabilities, kids with issues at home, kids who are behind in many subjects and provide them opportunities outside of school to succeed?    If it's just about the money, find another profession.|`|AA10064810	The salary a teacher is paid varies wildly by school district.  You will find out that salaries are higher in places that are more expensive to live in but the cost of living robs that value.  Also, most school districts have a scale that you advance up as you teach more years and as you get more education (masters, PhD).    I found this information which is not specific to any individual school district:  http://www.teachingtips.com/average-teac...  Some teachers earn more money by teaching night school or coach.  Those opportunities are usually available to high school teachers.    Usually there are two different types of music teaching:  vocal and instrumental done by different teachers.      Since you are a junior, you have access to music teachers in your school you can question.  You can contact your local school district for a salary schedule.  You can contact the California and Colorado state teacher licensing board to find out about requirements in their states.      Most preschool jobs are not found within school systems.  They are private.   And, music and preschool teaching have very different educational requirements.      You should use your time in high school to become as well read as possible, learn as much as you can from all your courses, and learn to speak and write effectively.  These skills will help you in college and on any job.

Good Luck!!!!|`|b3TljD0Laa	Hey I'm in high school right now...  and know that what I'm about to say applies to all schools, but  so far high school isn't that confusing or scary. The staff and upperclassmen know that everyone feels that way (might-pee-in-my-pants nervous) so they go through all the stuff you need to know. Plus, more than half of the freshman class all are confused, so at least you'll be lost with someone, right? And high school is fun. You may not have lunch or classes with your friends, but you'll find a way to keep in touch, and as long as you're not a snotty brat then you'll make new friends. And about the clothes... I alternate stores a lot but Delia*s is one of my favorites. Even if they don't have a store near you, they have catalogs and a online store. Their clothes aren't exactly cheap but if you get them on sale then it's not crazy-expensive. (And even if Abercrombie, Hollister, and AE and such are all overpriced, if you get them on sale then it's not too bad.)

This means that with your 1850, you are quite above the national average. It is a good score, and can help you get accepted into more competitive colleges.  However, this does not mean you are guaranteed to be accepted into a school like Cornell. Visit www.collegeboard.com to check out Cornell University's median SAT scores and see if you match up.   Also like I stated before, your scores will help you in your applications to more competitive schools. With your apparent intelligence, you should not attend a community college. Community colleges accept anyone with a high school diploma. Shoot for a higher level school.|`|Zk4pn8oKaa	Dats good because the average sat score is 1500

23e56b78adf7e68681e320826b9f2b1faa	It depends on what your goal is and how well you do on standardized tests. The SAT tests what you should have spent your entire school career learning- how to comprehend a passage of literature, how to construct a grammatically correct paragraph, and relatively simple math (up through Algebra 2, I believe).     The first time I took the SAT, I didn't study at all and got a 2200; the second time, I did a little review the night before (mainly on things that tripped me up the first time) and got a 2280. I also know people who studied for months and had private tutors, but still didn't break 1800. However, I had taken quite a few AP and honors courses and read A LOT in my spare time. Neither of those specifically prepared me for the SAT test, but the skills (and vocab) I learned from them is why I did so well for so little studying.    From what other people have told me, I think your best course of action is to take a couple practice tests (some are available for free online and some SAT prep books have a lot of practice tests). Figure out what areas you're weak in, and then attack those. A lot of free SAT prep can be found online if you poke around.  Then, take a couple more practice tests.     On testing day, take a few deep breaths and remain calm. Don't panic. It's just a test, and you'll have opportunities to retake it. It's not worth losing sleep over.    So yes, one month is enough, especially if you're smart about how you study. Just don't freak yourself out.|`|r1cDHOsHaa	depends on the hours you spend on it. If you are studying 2 month NON STOP then yes. 3 months if only studying an hour or two a day|`|9r1zw0evaa	dont mind me, just tryin 2 get 1k pts.    NO, ITS NOT!!!

This will give me 3.5 good years of studying various books and materials to fully enhance by brain and understand the material given to students on the SAT.    I would say no. You should give yourself plenty of time to study for a big exam like the SAT. But if I was in youre case, I would first get the OFFICIAL SAT study guide(the recent one) and master it. I would do like 50 pages of the book in a day. At the end of each day, review past SAT material you have studied. When you are in youre last 4 to 5 days before the test, review the SAT book material carefully.    hope this helped.

AA10064810	If this has actually happened (the strange seating plan) complain to your parents and counselor because there is no educational advantage I can think of for this sort of thing to go on.  Unless he tries other plans, all guys in the front, etc. for variety.  Making sexist comments is also a no, no.  When you complain, have specific words written down, just say exactly what he said.  No one can help if all you tell them is that is is anti-feminist and sexist.      As for the other rumors, rumors about teachers go around all the time.  In my first elementary school, I found out that students were saying that teachers took off their clothes and danced naked on the tables in the teachers' lounge.  I'd take that all with a grain of salt.    As for propositioning students, it is up to students to support any girl or guy who comes forward because this has happened to them.

AA10064810	Some people consider being forced to volunteer an intrusion into a person's private life, forcing them to do something they may never want to do on their own and limiting the places where they can get credit for volunteering without considering the student's values.  Personally, I think that volunteering is an excellent way to help and to get insight into what other people are doing and going through.      You could also argue that the student can't spend enough time at the volunteer job to make any real difference to the organization and may actually take up the time that they could use for a better purpose.|`|AA12178390	can't really call it volunteer work if you force someone to do it.    How would that work in other areas of society if your boss says "I need someone to volunteer to work extra hours, oh by the way if you don't volunteer your fired!"    Forcing kids to do "volunteer" work is pointless and stupid and down right selfish of the school. And I say this as someone who use to work with teen volunteers at the American Red Cross.     My youth volunteers were great, amazing really and that is because they wanted to be there. When I would get a kid who was forced to be there because their parent wanted them to do it, the kid hated it, resented me, and did not do the work I asked. We don't have time to deal with kids who don't want to be there.     I have found more than enough kids want to do volunteer work for college application that I never need to seek out kids who were forced to come by their parent or school. And the kids who want to be there do an amazing job, I mean I was able to train a 16 year girl, who wanted to be an account, one of the hardest parts of my job to the point that she was doing the bookkeeping for the Red Cross by her self. With 8 kids like her I could probably take the whole week off.  But she was good because she was interested in what we were doing. A kid who is just coming to get "their  hours" will do the minimum work and probably goof off, which means I would have to fix what ever they do and watch over them while they do it. Since the school won't pay me to babysit I am not going to do that.    I see a benefit in student volunteers I do not see one in student slaves.|`|9hhoxEs0aa	Well, at my school, we have to have +45 hours completed in order to pass that grade. I have 88 but that's because I do mine over the summer. I think it is good though, because then kids give back to their community, which hardly anyone does anymore. Also it forced kids to do things other than going on the internet, playing video games, and texting. It's a good thing to do.

However an increasing GPA over your HS years is a positive - but not as good as someone who got your later years GPA all the way through.    Thanks  Bill|`|fv2L5e4Haa	All of them!  It's a common misconception that certain years (like freshman) doesn't matter. However, they all go into your GPA equally. Junior Year and the first have of Senior Year are probably a little more important because it's your most recent work and Universities like to see intellectual growth over your HS career.|`|Tfbbtxrjaa	Sure, they look at all of your grades. What also matters is how hard the class was (advanced vs. general) and your SAT and ACT scores!

i5ZNMHR9aa	It is very tough to get a student loan without a co-signer even if the co-signer makes over $19,000 as another person as suggested. I was the victim of a scam and my credit got ruined. My Dad has excellent credit but no one will approve a student loan with him as a co-signer because he's only been at his current job for 6 months. My fiance has ok credit and makes almost $40,000 and they wouldn't accept him as a co-signer either. I have applied to every bank and loan company I could find on the internet. I even started calling to find out their minimum credit scores to see if it would even be worth while to apply. I got the same answer each time "we don't give out that information". They all just wanted me to apply and "see" if I will get approved. I told them I know they wouldn't approve me because I've applied to all of them before. (I was able to get some negatives off my credit report and raise the score to 610 but no one will tell me if that's high enough and all want to run my credit again! That will show as an injury and cause it to go down even more!!)     http://loan-house.we.bs/studentloan.html     Pre Prime loans are the loans to students who have no credit and no co-signer. The only requirement is that the student does not have bad credit. They also consider the student's high school GPA and intended major as factors.    http://loan--house.blogspot.com/2008/03/...|`|RNx4ZZIVaa	That is gong to be very difficult to do. Most student loans require a cosigner despite the fact that they will lead you to believe right up until paperwork time that you can get one on your own.     You credit score is very good but how long is your credit history? I'm 25 and a common reason I got from loan companies to deny me a loan is that my credit history wasn't long enough and although I was considered "credit ready" or "credit worthy" I still needed a cosigner. Basically no matter how responsible you are with money they will want a cosigner as a backup regardless.    My advice is to find someone...anyone with good credit to cosign for you. Just explain to them that you have great credit and do not expect them to make any payments for you but you need a cosigner because the loan company requires one.    Another option you may want to consider is removing your parents financial info from your fafsa and filing as independent if you have a job and pay your own expenses.|`|xc6AgwOMaa	Have you tried chase student loans?

RvBIimOdaa	Probably the reason why you're not good is because you're nervous and I bet almost everyone in the class will be scared too.  Choose your subject. Write 10 important point about that subject. For instance, "I'm glad I'm alive when..."  I play with my puppy  I eat ice cream   It's a sunny day  I can play in the snow  I go out for pizza with Dad  I can sunggle into my bed with a book  Mum hugs me  I go on holiday with my family  Its the last day of the semester  I play basketball (or whatever)   Make a list of ALL the things which make you feel good.  Get 10 cards, or pieces of stiff paper, write the good things on one side and on the other, a few words about why they make you fel good.  For instance. "I eat ice-cream" on one side and on the other, "ice cream is so delicious, my favourite flavor is strawberry and next is chocolate. I like eating it in a bowl so I can stir it round and make it all creamy."    Next step is to lay your cards out in front of a mirror and have a clock handy.   Look at the clock to time yourself, pick a card up, say, (out loud)  'I'm glad I'm alive when I can eat ice cream and here's why....."  and turn the card over and remind yourself about those words.  Say all this out loud as if you were in class. This'll get you used to hearing your own voice and listening if any words don't sound right.  Carry on until you've mentioned all 10 points.  Do this practice in front of some or all members of your family. Speak slowly, clearly, (if you rush you have to find more words!) try to find something amusing to say so your audience laughs.  "When I was three yours old, I got ice cream on my nose but I didn't know for ages and I looked like a clown."    Practice will give you confidence.  You'll be just fine  Good luck

7Z3hWNewaa	Yes, it has failed miserably. Bush essentially put a law into effect that allows people as dumb as him to pass high school.    As a reaction to No Child Left Behind, Ohio enacted the Ohio Graduation Test, or OGT. My class, HS Grad of '07, had to take this our sophomore year of High School. The test was probably the dumbest thing I have ever taken. The passing level for it was even a 30%, with students averaging 95% on all tests.

Now the schools are just teaching to the test instead of teaching what the children need to learn.

Most of my employees are teenagers. One of the things I've noticed over the years is critical thinking and reasoning skills seem to be less and less common. I think this may be largely due to teachers having to teach students to pass a test, rather than teaching them how to think. What's worse is the students are taking tests that don't mean anything to them. As I understand it, the results of the standardized testing have little to no impact on the student's placement or anything else - it's strictly used to judge the schools and set funding.    One of the key problems is No Child Left Behind takes moneys from schools that need it most. If a school isn't producing good test scores, that's often a sign of underfunding.

She could've gotten in if it weren't for her choice to go to Brooklyn Tech. Since we all evaluated that 560 was the cutoff score for Stuy, she was ahead by 9 points, but didn't choose Stuy first. :( I spent the rest of the day yelling at her xD    I am extremely happy with what I got, I'd tell people "I'm the bottom of the top of the world" :) Some people however, were crying really badly in my school when they didn't make it to Stuy. Alot of crying in my  class as well.     The verbal part of the test was WAAY easier than I thought it was. But the math, one of my best subjects, had some hard questions. And it killed me that I figured out how to get the answers for the harder questions AFTER the test was over. But overall, I'm really happy about it all.

I got into Stuyvesant! I got in with a score of 616 along with two other people in my class. The valedictorian got 30 points higher than me, I think.     That test scared me more than anything. I thought for sure I wasn't going to get into a god high school because first thing I hear when I walked out of the testing site was: "I'm so getting into Tech! That test was so easy!"  It seemed like everyone who said it was easy got 300's, especially one kid who said he finished the test in an hour.|`|qtq516fUaa	Eh Stuy with 573... Could have done better, I slept only 6 hours, the first 10 minutes i had to go to the bathroom, and I finished with 20 minutes to spare (bad thing), I believe there won't be a class of 2013. Whew it's time to get out of this crappy gangster infested school.    Edit: The math was pretty easy for me while I absent-mindly finished the English, the SHSAT Prep I took in Nation Wide Master, Flushing was great. They split the 100 applied students for the program into 3 groups, (Class AA, Class A, and Class A1), AA being the highest and A1 being the lowest. Last year, in the AA class, everyone went to Stuyvesant.    P.S: I'm in Class AA (Eh about 4th from the bottom of the AA Class).

A lot of my friends are doing that sort of thing, ask a younger person; such as a 9th or 10th grader for a tutor, that is the grade in which tutoring is most popular. In the mean time just get extra credit and ask your teacher for you to stay after school, or class and have a little extra help, or a 1 on 1 conversation with her to see what you can do. If that doesn't help you might want to consider dropping down a math level. Colleges look at semester grades; not 6 weeks grades so you need to get an A for the next semester or else the chances of getting into a nice college are more slim.|`|8uwxNh4Kaa	That's what school is.

UmHdJbWLaa	Okay well... i was the exact same way.!!!!. Are you a girl? bc if you are JOIN CHEERLEADING!!!! that helped me get out of my shell so much.  and if you are a boy  JOIN FOOTBALL!!! that helps extremely too. It helps u get more into games with friends, and branch out. i cant explain why, but it does.    Okay and also.... just go over and talk to friends, have inside jokes and scream it out torwards the end of class when u r packing up. Or if u ahve a fun teacher, in the middle for no reason. or at lunch. Me and my friends and   'FOR NARNIA!!!!" and we do it in slow motion. Or we just pause in the middle of no where. Dont ask how... it just happens.. That makes u seem much more open and friendly. If u dont have friends, walk up to a random group and start cracking a few jokes, like Dead baby Jokes. (go on google, and look up dead baby jokes.) Or make up your own! They are easy to make up, escpecially inside jokes. maybe in the middle of gym  or math start sining  Lalalalallala!!! or a dora the explorer theme song. And to make your face not go red. just calm down relax and know nothing is going wrong. Maybe practice some situations at home That helped me. And if someone says im quiet. say No i'm not!   And maybe say I just feel tiredd. And something the best trick is to dress good and wear your hair good, bc then u feel confident u look good. So u act more confident. If u are a girl, like put ure make up on in class to seem more popular or girly, and if u r a boy maybe burp and look around and say "that wasn't me" And look around casually.   I am kind of in a rush, but i could write tons more, If u need more maybe post anothr questgion later with more info. and i'lll TRY to look for it.   remember try joinging chee|`|RmZ54Shvaa	talk little more and more every week until u get as loud as u usually are. i was th same way

34VXCyvVaa	Yes, if they accept 70% of their applicants, it means that 7 out of 10 students who apply will be accepted.  So they accept a majority of the students who apply.  A low percentage rate means that most students who apply will be rejected and only 11% (or whatever) will be accepted.

Now  mid-terms and finals are different, whereby the professor's responsibility, I think, (cause they did this when I was in college) is to at least brief the students on what chapters will be covered on the exams.  If you're so concerned, check with the department advisor and find out what their teaching guidelines or ethics consists and make a complaint. Good luck.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Students.    Your job is to learn the material. Just because the teacher does not spoon feed it to you does not absolve you of your obligation to learn the material.|`|8YYwdccpaa	No teacher is obligated to offer study sessions, give exam overviews, provide study guides, etc. Even so, some students will earn excellent grades because they are good students and they work hard.    Many teachers chose to do these things. Some students will fail or earn poor grades because they are not studying enough, because they are not the best in the class, because they don't care. . .     It is a teacher's responsibility to know the information and to convey it as he or she thinks is best. It is the student's responsibility to learn it. Once upon a time, a C was considered a respectable grade and the average for a course. It is not unfair if someone holds those standards and creates a challenging and difficult course.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	it would probably be the fault of both, students be better prepared & teacher review better with the students

5jOIyDfNaa	Middle School is probably the best experience all the education institutions. School is easy if you put a little effort in, you get a lot more freedom, and depending on what school you go to, you'll probably find a lot of friends to hang out with and maybe a girlfriend too. Remember, just a little effort goes a long way in Middle School. Chances are a lot of kids are going to be looking for new friends when they enter Middle School, so just look for the signals and you'll have a circle of friends soon enough.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Irony (from the Ancient Greek ?? eironea, meaning hypocrisy, deception, or feigned ignorance) is a literary or rhetorical device, in which there is an incongruity or discordance between what one says or does and what one means or what is generally understood. Irony is a mode of expression that calls attention to the character's knowledge and that of the audience.    There is some argument about what qualifies as ironic, but all senses of irony revolve around the perceived notion of an incongruity between what is said and what is meant; or between an understanding of reality, or an expectation of a reality, and what actually happens.    The term Socratic irony, coined by Aristotle, refers to the Socratic Method, and is not irony in the modern sense of the word.    In drama, the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus of placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. Dramatic irony has three stages - installation, exploitation and resolution (sometimes called preparation, suspension and resolution) - producing dramatic conflict is produced in what one character relies or appears to rely upon a fact, the contrary of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true.    For example:    In City Lights, the audience knows that Charlie Chaplin's character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl (Virginia Cherill) is unaware.     In Cyrano de Bergerac, the reader knows that Cyrano loves Roxane and that he is the real author of the letters that Christian is writing to the young woman; Roxane is unaware of this.     In North by Northwest, the audience knows that Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is not Kaplan; Vandamm (James Mason) and his acolytes do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger and Vandamm do not.     In Oedipus the King, the reader knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon and Jocasta do not.     In Othello, the reader knows that Desdemona has been faithful to Othello, but Othello doesn't. The reader also knows that Iago is pulling the strings, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio and Roderigo.     In Pygmalion, the reader knows that Eliza is a woman of the street; Higgins's family does not.    In Cask of Amontillado, the reader knows something bad is going to happen to Fortunato, Fortunato is oblivious
AA10023710	CanProf gave you my favorite link- the one to the SUNY Online Learning Network. You can see all the online degrees given by the SUNYs. Keep in mind that Empire State is their adult ed/distance learning college, and if you'd rather stick with a college that isn't famous for being online or adult ed, go with the few others on that list.     Other colleges in NY that I know offer online degrees include CUNY, NYIT, Excelsior College, St. Joseph's College, Mercy College, NYU, Polytechnic University, Monroe College, Pace University, Ithaca College, and there could be others as well.|`|AA11942204	You can get all sorts of degrees online through SUNY http://sln.suny.edu/sln/public/original....

You can always switch from the IB Diploma to the IB certificate where you don't have to take all IB courses! Though I've been in both IB and AP, and they're both equal for me!|`|ZpdSNccsaa	Switch to AP they will help when you get into college|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	I would switch to AP classes since you can if you score high enough in the AP college board test receive college credit for the course.

vcgtkAFLaa	Hi   As a junior you know that you need to have certain amounts of credit to graduate.  I am glad to see that you are concerned and that you are making plans for night school and summer school.  Your Bs and Cs are okay.  It is very hard to miss high school days.  When you do miss, make sure to get your work for that day from a friend, call  or email the teacher, maybe they have a school web page where the homework is posted, and try to get those done so you are not overwhelmed by the amount of work missed.  You are on the right track and realize that you want to do better.  Always do you best.  I hope you are well.   Good luck,  Freewheelingx :)|`|LvYOURPXaa	Well you should be trying hard..school sucks we all know..make the best of it and actually tried to enjoy it! thats what helped me get through it|`|8uwxNh4Kaa	You don't have too.

lx5DnQLKaa	No, i don't think for a second that you'll be failed.  You're obviously passionate about Art, and very good at it, and your tutors would have picked up on that too.  There's no way they would fail an enthusiastic pupil with high level coursework and who intends to study this subject at Degree level, just because they were off school a couple of days and missed a deadline. They would know you were not deliberately skipping school, why would you?     Besides, that is probably just the teacher's deadline so they can mark your coursework, correct errors, suggest improvements etc. Then they will give you it back to improve THEN set the REAL deadline for it to be sent off to examiners.     Don't worry, tutors are really understanding, they don't WANT to fail students. sorry if i rambled a bit, hope this helped. don't worry at all, you'll be fine ;)    edit:   to the GUY above who just said ''period  cramps mean nothing'' you cannot comment on a pain you've never felt.|`|8uwxNh4Kaa	You will probably fail because period cramps mean nothing when your working to be something big. To be someone in this world and make money.  EDIT- You weren't in the hospital,sick or not you could have gotten up and gave it to them or sent a friend.  Edit::I never said they meant NOTHING i said its NOTHING compared to working to be something big.  Learn to read,People are so ignorant.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Poisson, Raymond (c. 1630-1690). Comic actor (under the name of Belleroche) at the H?tel de Bourgogne, where he created the role of Crispin.  Although his baptismal certificate has not been found yet, all biographers agree that Raymond Poisson was born about 1630, according to the version of Henry Lyonnet. Seul Victor Fournel claims that it would have been born in 1633, but without sources. He died in Paris on the 9th or 10th of May 1690.     He used the pseudonym of Belleroche, and is also referenced under the name of Crispin Ier, referring to the character that he generally played and that he made famous.    Orphaned early, he was initially a domestic servant of the Duke Charles III of Crquy, then of his/her brother Fran?ois, but, pulled by a taste for the theater, Belleroche left their service c. 1650 to enlist in a troop of actors which played in provinces.    Noticed by Louis XIV in one of his voyages, the troop integrated at the H?tel of Burgundy in 1660, in order to play comic skits. They continued to play there continuously until the troop retired during  Easter 1685.     It is in the role of the Crispin servant that Poisson was distinguished particularly. The Crispin role established his type (i.e., typecasted him), gave him a recognizable physique, and helped him to evolve/move throughout his career, by its play and the personality that it conferred to him--particularly grimaces, mumbling, and acrobatics. The public enjoyed Poisson in this role so much that this character became a frequent first role in comedies written from in 1660 afterward.     Beginning in 1670, the name of the servant Crispin even appeared in the titles of the skits and plays.    This great comic actor was well-recognized by his peers, and his talents of improvisation enabled him on several occasions to play the roles of Italian jokers, such as Scaramouche and Arlequin in 1681.    On August 8th, 1680, when the Duke of Crqui wrote the orders of the King for the junction of two large Parisian troops, the name of Poisson appeared in the list drawn by the King.  Poisson thus appeared in the news Comdie-Fran?aise, born from the fusion of the troop of the H?tel of Burgundy and that of the Gungaud. At Comdie-Fran?aise, Poisson always played Crispin, while authors wrote roles which fit his age, sharing comic roles with Hauteroche, Raisin and the actors of old the Troupe of Molire, who all deeply appreciated him.    Belleroche wrote a dozen plays, ten of which were published between 1661 and 1681, and gathered in a volume of works in 1679, then in two volumes in 1687. One understands with the reading of the nine parts that he wrote that he was lost to posterity through the overshadowing fame of Molire who, in addition to having the genius of the scene like Poisson, was even more skilled at writing.  However, the liveliness of Poisson's play cannot be missed. Their cheerfulness can appear coarse, versification is sometimes weak, and the style is often mundane, but the personifications are truly those of an actor-author, allowing for great possibilities of play, and testifying to the intricacies of the contemporaneous theatrical profession.    Poisson's greatest success, which has attained the greatest endurance with the theater, is The Baron of the Filth (1662).  Other lasting contributions are are Lubin or the Stupid One Avenged (1661) in worms for eight syllables, The Insane Reasonable (1664), the After-soup of the Inns (1665) (which was one of the first parts to play on comic of language, with many accents, identifiable with the writing), the False Muscovites (1668), the Basque Poet (1668) (an excellent comedy of the actors which offers to the two main roles of the seldom explored possibilities of play), Vain Women (1670) (his only comedy in five acts), Sick Holland (1672), and Diverting the Insane (1680).  Poisson's ?uvres were combined in Paris, 1687 and 1743, 2 vol. in-12.    His many light comedies have been forgotten, but The Baron of Filth (Le Baron de la Crasse) stands out because it depicts a strolling company whose leader may be intended as a satirical portrait of Molire. Poisson's son Paul (16581735) carried on the family tradition, playing many of his father's parts, especially Crispin, at the Comdie-Fran?aise from 1686 to 1724. He married an actress, and their sons Philippe (16821743) and Fran?ois-Arnould (16961753) were both on the stage.
i405qKokaa	I'm not sure of the name, but I remember a college in North Shropshire providing tons of these courses not so long back, and you could advance onto courses such as Accountancy, Surveying etc etc.Think it was North Shropshire College.They were friendly enough to talk to.  Alternatively go to Learn Direct website, they have a searchable database of accredited course providers that you can search which is probably your best bet.|`|xN5QDXMmaa	Type long-distance course providers in the uk into google and it should come up with some of them for you.

If you do well, they will send you information packets or try to find out more information about you.  If you don't do well, they just won't remember your name anyways.   When you actually apply to the college, you will be required to send in all of your SAT scores, and your highest ones are the ones that count.      Send them in anyways, it will be a good source of information.  And study for the SAT.  Your school library may have a good study book, or your local library or bookstore.|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	Send the scores anyways. You will need to have them resent if your score better on the second round./|`|QC6pR4y6aa	they look at the best scrore. i am having the same problems about choooseing collleges. i filled out the whole thing online, then quit unitl next month so i can think about it. it depends on what u wanna do when u get older, certain college are better for certain things.|`|ySpFTMwFaa	If you send new scores to the same schools they don't look at the old scores unless they were better then your second scores. They look at the scores you did best in.|`|FXGqcKpEaa	If you think you can make a higher score, then you should retake the exam, that way if you do score higher you can just send those scores to the four college of your choice instead of the originals. Also, with the list of the schools you are considering to apply to, go on petersons.com or the schools' websites to check out what SAT scores are acceptable.  With this information, you will have a better idea as to whether to retake the test or not.  In that list of schools, try to weed out one school that you are really interested in, even if your not 100% sure, and work your way down to your next favorite and so forth. Besides, a lot of people aren't completely sure about what school is right for them, for no one knows for sure until they actually attend the school. So, even if you have one or two schools your not too positive about, send in those scores anyway, what can it hurt?

The UK's full title is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.|`|9oeHuGGOaa	The United Kingdom is a country that consists of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In fact, the official name of the country is "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."    Great Britain is the name of the island northwest of France and east of Ireland that consists of three somewhat autonomous regions: England, Wales and Scotland.    Therefore, England is part of Great Britain, which is part of the United Kingdom. The U.K. includes England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are not countries but the United Kingdom is. The remaining portion of the island of Ireland (that which is not the U.K.'s Northern Ireland) is an independent country called the Republic of Ireland (Eire).    JMK  http://realjobdescriptions.com
