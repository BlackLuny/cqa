I carried out three analytical experiments.   Two of the experiments were spectroscopic techniques and one was a chromatographic technique.   In the spectroscopic technique experiments I was provided with river water evidence sample and had to determine whether it was unpolluted (no coloured dye present) or if the sample contains any level of the pollutants in the water.   In the first experiment I used a colorimeter to determine the absorbance values for the river water at a range of wavelengths.   In the second experiment I used a colorimeter again to determine the absorbance values for the water reference samples of known concentration.   In the third experiment I placed the river water sample along with five dyes on a chromatogram to determine which dyes the river water contained.

20090131200519AAGvoaG	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	PLEASE HELP, I AM ABOUT TO CRY BECAUSE I CANNOT FIGURE OUT THIS CHEMISTRY QUESTION!?	This has to be done using conservation of mass and I cannot figure it out.      You carefully weigh out 11.00g of CaCO3 powder and add it to 44.55g of HCl solution. You notice bubbles as a reaction takes place. You then weigh the resulting solution and find that it has a mass of 51.04g. The relevant equation is:      CaCO2(s)+2HCl(aq)-->H2O(l)+CO2(g)+CaCl...      What mass of CO2 was produced in this reaction?   Assume that the reaction goes to 100% completion producing only three desired products.

20090131165502AASEI4C	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	I think I'm addicted to oxycontin. What should I do?	I'm seventeen, male, and just recently crashed my car into a pole. I broke my femur, tibia, and knee. For the first two weeks of recovery, my pain was treated with oxycodone. Today was my first day of transition from oxycodone to tylenol 3. I have felt really down and unmotivated all day, not to mention the excruciating pain along with it. What I'm experiencing seems to be a combination of withdrawal and not being used to the pain that my previous prescription aided completely. Come Monday, I'll have to go to school and do my best without oxycodone, and I think this will be an incredible obstacle to face. Does anyone have any suggestions for me to try and not want this drug anymore? I crave the relief it provides, and I can't have it anymore because it isn't available. Thank you.

20090131184435AA18nyj	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	What would be a good medicine over the counter or prescription that can be used for Impotence. My boyfriend ?	suffers from Impotence. He has tried Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra. None of the work for him except it will make him sick. He has been diagnosed with addictive personality, so his body has a difficult time taking medication as he has tried several medications ranging from aspirins, Dilaudid, Depakote amongst others that were given to him from doctor for back pain. Some medications doctors say will cause one to get sleepy with other side effects, however with him once he takes these medications although it relaxes him a bit it has the opposite effect on him. He'll try really hard to sleep but due to medication not working he stays awake. Doctors tried finding medication that would work but thus far nothing. He and I felt maybe there could be either a combination of two medications together or herbal remedies would work in regard to the Impotence. He feels that although the other medical issues are important he can for the most part cope with 50-60% of pain he endures but feels that there must be something he could take for the Impotence just as we believe the same is true for his medical issues. Therefore I ask does anyone know of a medication(s) either prescribed or over the counter that would work and has been known as having positive results with close to null in side effects? Any suggestions & advice would be appreciated.

20090131190405AAb3xtL	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Time, does it go on forever?	I was thinking about the theory that time goes on forever. By this logic, that would mean that every single possible scenario has been done in the pas, since time has had forever to do it, therefore meaning that eventually everything would have to be done once. However, if I told someone to put a book in one place, pick it up, and put it there again would it not be impossible? I could keep on saying that they are 0.1 mm off, 0.001 mm, and keep on adding more and more zeros. However, if time has infinite time to do this, would that mean that eventually one could accomplish this, or would it be impossible since you could just keep on putting on more zero's? Question may be a bit hard to understand, but if you get what I'm saying, it gets reaaaally confusing :P

20090131180308AADgLHF	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics problem: What is the deceleration of the vehicle?	A speed trap is set up with two pressure activated strips placed across a highway, 128 meters apart. A car is speeding along at 28.8 meters per second, while the speed limit is only 19.6 meters per second. At the instant the car activates the first strip, the driver begins slowing down. What minimum deceleration (magnitude only) is needed so that the driver's average speed is within the limit by the time the car crosses the second strip?      I've tried several times, but end up getting the wrong answer (I don't know what the correct answer is, I'm just informed that my answer is wrong).      How do I start this?   Also, apparently to find the final speed of the vehicle, you have to find the average...Is that (initial speed + speed limit)/2 ?      PLEASE HELP!   thx =)

Adam, Brooke, Corey, Danielle, and William want to bring there dog to the party, but they are having some trouble. There is only 1 boat to get back and forth from the mainland to doggy island, and the boat only has 3 seats on it. No owner is allowed to carry their dog on their lap. It goes without saying that only the dog owners can paddle the boat, with the exception of Wilbur the wonder dog. William has spent many years training his dog how to paddle a boat, so wilbur is the only dog that can paddle the boat. There must always be someone on the boat that is able to row it across the water. The problem with these dogs is that none of them are trained for good behavior. If a dog is left without its owner, it will bite any other dog owners that are around him. The dogs will never bite other dogs, only people. Figure out a way to get all the dog owners and their dogs over to doggy island to celebrate the new year!

Suppose that a drug-sniffing dog barks 95% of the time when drugs are present and barks 15% of   the time when drugs are not present. Suppose that 4% of students at a small school have drugs in   their lockers.   a) What is the probability that the dog will bark while sniffing a randomly selected locker?   b) If the dog barks at a locker, what is the probability that the locker actually contains drugs?      4. For a certain auction house, suppose that 80% of its items are sold at regular sales (the   remainder being sold at specialty sales). Additionally suppose that 15% of items are sold for more   than their appraised value. Finally, 60% of items at specialty sales are sold for more than their   appraised values. Suppose an item is selected from this auction house at random. Define event A =   {sold at specialty sale} and event B = {sold above appraised value}.   a) Are the events A and B independent? Support your answer with appropriate probabilities.   b) What is the probability that the item will be sold at a specialty sale and will be sold for more   than its appraised value?   c) Are the events A and B mutually exclusive (disjoint)? Support your answer with appropriate   probabilities.   d) Determine the probability that the selected item is not sold at a specialty sale but is sold for   more than its appraised value.
