bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	A imprensa n?o critica o Marcelo Camelo porque ela é a institui??o mais contraditória e tosca que existe.<br>  <br>  O Michael Jackson, por exemplo, quando foi lan?ado o documentário "A vida íntima de Michael Jackson" (aquele documentário polêmico lan?ado há uns 4 anos atrás, na época em que ele estava sendo julgado por pedofilia) e ele apareceu de m?os dadas com um garoto de 14 anos que aparentemente gostava do Michael Jackson e estava fazendo aquilo por vontade própria, todo mundo caiu em cima dizendo que o Michael era um aproveitador, sendo que o próprio menino e os pais dele permitiram tudo.<br>  Eu n?o acho que seja adequado um homem de 30, 40 ou 50 anos se relacionar com um adolescente, mas creio que a mídia é muito parcial ao avaliar esse tipo de situa??o. O Michael Jackson, só porque é esquisito, mundialmente famoso e polêmico é crucificado pela mídia. Já o Marcelo Camelo, só porque é um cara "normal" e n?o costuma chamar tanto a aten??o quanto o Michael, ninguém critica o cara.<br>  A minha opini?o pessoal sobre o assunto é que tanto o Michael Jackson quanto o Marcelo Camelo n?o est?o errados. Se o adolescente já tem uma certa idade (entre 14 e 18 anos), tem conhecimentos sobre sexo, sabe o que está fezendo, entra no relacionamente de livre e espontanea vontade e seus responsáveis est?o de acordo, n?o vejo grandes problemas em uma rela??o entre um adulto e um adolescente. Eu só acho errado a mídia ficar detonando umas pessoas por fazerem isso e deixar outras pessarem batidas.<br>  O mesmo é o que eu vejo acontecer com o Roberto Justus. A mídia toda critica ele por só namorar mulheres muito mais jovens do que ele (a Eliana, a Adriane Galisteu e a Ticiane Pinheiro), mas o Marcelo Camelo também está namorando uma garota bem mais jovem do que ele e ninguém fala nada! A diferen?a nessa situa??o é que, como o Roberto Justus é milionário, as revistas de fofoca exp?em ele como um "comprador de namoradas".<br>  <br>  <br>  Obs.: eu só considero um relacionamento entre um adolescente e uma pessoa muito mais velha como crime quando o adolescente é for?ado ou coagido a isso.<br>  <br>  Obs. 2: eu n?o acho que a Mallu Magalh?es seja t?o menininha assim. Ela até demonstra essa infantilidade nas entrevistas, mas eu acho que ela faz isso de propósito, mas for?ar uma imagem de "menina prodígio".<br>  <br>  Obs. 3: eu n?o sinto atra??o por pessoas mais jovens do que eu.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!|`|b78pfRp9aa	Isso é uma quest?o muito mais cultural do que legal.<br>  <br>  Se as pessoas se ocupassem mais da sua própria vida ao invés de ficar julgando a vida alheia o mundo seria um lugar muito melhor.<br>  Se alguém tem o direito de se sentir lesado é a tal Mallu e a sua respectiva familia, e ao meu ver eles est?o consentido com o fato, quem somos nós para julgar o que é certo ou errado ? Sempre tento evitar conceitos como Bem e Mal pois n?o s?o estáticos, variam de pessoa pra pessoa, época, cultura, religi?o, etc...<br>  A única coisa que podemos fazer é desejar boa sorte e que sejam felizes.|`|VoFZBMSraa	é aquela velha hstória, "filha dos outros pode"|`|8cfb3039914cf1e875ec63a8f6899403aa	Em que século estamos vivendo? XX, XIX? Moral é indispensável mas bom senso também. Se ela se sentisse molestada e se os pais notassem algo além, óbvio que alguma atitude deveria ser tomada, mas a mo?a é quase maior de idade. Hoje em dia quem tem 16 anos sai à noite com amigos, pode votar, pode aprender a dirigir junto com os pais SE QUISER. Nos EUA jovens com essa idade já podem tirar o documento equivalente à carteira de habilita??o. Menores respondem por crimes lá e cá , e no caso se o criminoso fosse Marcelo Camelo ele certamente iria responder pelo crime de sedu??o. Se ela fosse violentada seria algo abominável, mas ela permitiu a aproxima??o dele!!! Se a mentalidade dela é de uma crian?a de 8 anos isso é problema do casal, da família dela. Muita gente se casa e tem filhos sem mentalidade alguma, sem pensar nos problemas e nas conseqüências que a vida de um casal com filho sempre traz.

Nadya is unemployed and has no viable means of support. 3 of her 6 children receive disability payments for ADHD, Autism and a slight speech delay. The octuplets' medical care is being paid for by Cal-Med, the medicaid program offered by the state of Cailifornia. In addition, Nadya never gave her mother any money while she lived there with her 6 children although her food stamp and disability payments totaled close to $3,000. <br>  <br>  Nadya's mother is facing the loss of her home. She has been foreclosed on and is in the process of completing bankruptcy proceedings.

Although she receives public assistance she was able to pay for a Beverly Hills fertility clinic AND hire a publicity firm. Perhaps she needs to focus on figuring out how to care for those kids.

All those kids will be full of hate in their heart. So can things change? Yes they can. But if we want them to change for the best, we need to stop Islam extremist from teaching these kids that.

2pQUMKb2aa	I am not quite clear on the question but I will try. Nancy usually investigates locations and questions everyone that could possibly be involved in the crime. She usually finds clues and then gets stuck. She then may have a car chase or something that puts her in danger. She then has a spark of intelligence and puts everything together|`|mePPZXAsaa	With pure intellect. She new how to decipher codes and figure out clues. She was like a sorta Superman, Batman, and Green Hornet, only all wrapped up in a pretty girl in a blue convertible.She is quite a heroic figure, one that in our culture we're more accustomed to seeing portrayed as a boy than as a girl: she's incorruptibly honest, steadfast, and courageous. Nancy works alone, facing every terror on her own, although with the support, encouragement, and appreciation of the grown-ups. It reminds me of mythic initiation rites, where the young person is challenged, with the full backing of the adults, to prove herself.|`|38mPolwgaa	Well I don't really know what you're looking for without more specifics of the details of the assignment/ class.<br>  <br>  I've read the books and played the computer games and basically shes just u good detective.

MMBrsrbcaa	Here is the program in a nutshell to get out of debt.<br>  1.  Stop using credit, pay cash for everything.<br>  2.  Pay all cards the minimum payment except one, through extra money at it.  Write 2 checks 1 for minimum payment one for just principle owed.  Once you pay that off, cut up the damn card so you dont use it.<br>  3.  Repeat 2 to all the rest of the cards.<br>  4.  Ask credit card to lower payment and interest. No need to pay someone to do it for you.<br>  <br>  Dont forget to pay yourself.  I would keep Cash on hand for a rainy day, and by the way it will start to pour very soon.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
VfowGdWLaa	I agree with you. Let me add that I think that Obama has a bigger task aside from the economy and security issues. That is the fact that he has a lot of people with high hopes in him and he can't let them down. Its like people in a church, that when the leader of the church does something wrong I mean sin, people or followers in that church will leave disappointed and with very little or no intentions of returning to a church again. He made to many promises just to get elected, now he has to meet at least some of those promises. I do not think that anyone is expecting that he does everything he promised, but he promised to much. He is a good orator, and very charismatic. But I think that people need to realize that Obama is not all that great. If Obama became president is because of the young voters and the fact that 96% of black americans voted for him. At the end, the majority of the people that did their homework on the candidates did not elect Obama. Obama won based on a selfish and childish vote.|`|9x4iA8bZaa	They have only gone too far because we as Americans allow it.  Political correctness in general, has gone too far. <br>  <br>   Right now President Obama is the new flavor of the week.  Just like Angelina Jolie's babies a few months ago.  In a few days or so, there will be another flavor to take all the media attention. That is untill he does something either good or bad to get more attention.|`|0RCGy3OOaa	+frankly because he doesn't look stupid, and hasn't said or done anything stupid yet,... he is the "face of change"....and whether or not his action(s) will serve to the country's best interests is yet to be seen, i am nearly convinced that he will have one of the greatest if not THEE greatest effect on our country of any president<br>  <br>  now i'll just go out and say that i DID NOT vote for either Obama OR McCain...<br>  <br>  you're right about the black history month and BET.. it's silly now. i'm sure the intent originally was to soften the walls of segregation..and open people's eyes to "differences"....but the reality at least in my opinion is that it only helps build these racial generalization and premonitions.|`|AA10138269	I don't believe the media treats President Obama like a god nor  do I believe that Afro-American history month isn't fair because Afro-Americans deserve this.|`|8NphFD9maa	Because he sounds like one of those baptist preachers on the radio on Sunday morning.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	He acted like he was god and they bought it. SUCKERS!!|`|JevPwCCtaa	...because the media wants to break him, period. The same way the media wants to feed people with music that sounds like garbage.<br>  <br>  REAL TALK: the more the media builds him up to be someone compared to the Messiah, the more they feel they have the right to blame him when he makes a mistake. Believe me, they're waiting for him to make a mistake...then maybe that'll be the next BIG story. FRONT PAGE! "OBAMA IS NOT WHO WE THOUGHT HE WAS!"<br>  Which would then give the media the right to BASH him.<br>  <br>  AND: Obama is not the antichrist! Please don't give him that much credit. He's just somebody who belives that his plan can work. Change is here!!!

R49w1Dr7aa	What can be said that hasn't already been said? If you were in a room of racially diverse people and you stood up and said "I'm proud to be White" do you think you would make it out of that room in one piece?<br>  <br>  Whites are the villains, the oppressors. Why should that change when irresponsible minorities can use it to blame their lot in life on us? <br>  <br>  I for one am not going to be blamed for things I never did to the Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics. It is too easy for them to call us racist and then walk away. How in the world can you prove that you are not a racist? I'm not even going to try.|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	Yes, and I think it should bother every white American in America because all these people who stated these remarks are total racist against the white American. It is offensive. I also believe that Obama is racist for sitting in the pews at Rev. Wright's church who spoke against Americans. I mean what would happen if lets see, a white American spoke against Africans, or Hispanics. Oh, they would go after that guy for using racist slurs. But what about these guys, you think Obama got after them for the way they handled themselves?? I don't think so. Anyway, the guys who spoke these kinds of things are a bunch of idiots who should not even get a chance to speak. They all owe Americans an apology, you will probably never hear that either.|`|c3DqvgE4aa	no|`|GzJLIHvTaa	No, they all seem quite honest.

His words, however, hold no power in the Obama administration.<br>  <br>  Reich was far from politically correct in this statement. Holder was painfully right. I think their statements reflect mass frustrations in the country.|`|ad556ed1eb5542a3f285b07745c4b9ceaa	Well, since Obama is Caucasian and African American he could be offended by all three of those statements.<br>  Why is race an issue at ALL?<br>  I thought the heart of the person is what matters.|`|UGk26Cxraa	Sounds to me like they (whoever they may be) want to start a race war or civil war 2, which given the current economic situation, and many analysts prospecting future riots, I hope things don't get that bad. I think they WANT americans to divide based on race due to the election, so that there will be hatred and mistrust between americans. I mean think about it, since when have we ever elected a black president, the moment he won the election, people should have knew something was up.

YrxLbfiIaa	Trust me on this ---- I have been around awhile (many decades) --- I have noticed over the last 50 years every time there is an economic downturn all the loons come out of the wall..... back in the day we had no internet but there were underground newspapers that would push these goofy ideas.... I used to buy them just because I thought they were strangely entertaining but of course never bought into this stuff.....<br>  <br>  Here was a popular rag for the kooks....|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	It could be possible with the way our government is heading. I mean if they can sign a PORKULUS bill and pass it without even reading the whole bill and if they can elect a Socialist into the white house who doesn't want to even release his birth certificate, college records, medical records to show the place of birth, if they can give each state parts of the PORKULUS bill and if your state doesn't want it the Federal government will give it to someone else but your state would still have to pay for it.......if ACORN can get away with what they did of helping get Obama elected, and if Americans are forced to reward Fannie, Freddy, (Wallstreet) etc....by using our tax dollars, then I would assume that this Socialist government can do what ever the heck they want. That's why our second ammendment is so important to know that we as American should be allowed to have guns for our protection and to protect our families.<br>  <br>  All I can say is that our government is corrupted with a bunch of Socialist liberals who have their own agendas.|`|spuz7DvNaa	Just search FEMA CAMPS and FEMA CASKETS on google or YouTube.

I also worry about this "Civilian National Security Force" that he was talking about in the campaign. What the hell does that mean? Whatever it is he said it should be just as well funded as our military. Wow! So whatever he is talking about it's going to be as big as our military.

DgLBtjWoaa	Eh, you're falling into a gray area here. We're really not supposed to bend the rules of the Constitution to catch terrorist (let's leave the obvious associations with the Patriot Act out of this). <br>  <br>  I remember hearing shortly after 9/11 that they knew there were terrorist training camps in the U.S., so this really isn't anything new at all. As long as they're not breaking laws, what really can the gov't do? Do they have guns? Sure, but we're allowed to have guns. Do they have books that tell how to make explosives? Sure, but reading's not illegal. Do they talk about the best way to blow things up? They might, but that's just conjecture as long as it's not conspiracy, and if it is, it takes a while to build these cases. <br>  <br>  Trust me, the Feds are trying their best to nail these people, but they're slippery. Shut down a training camp in Washington and another pops up in Maine. If nothing else, al Qaeda is extremely well organized in that they don't rely on a central command structure to disseminate orders. It's kinda like, "Anyone hate Westerners? You do? Ok, good. Go kill them" and they do. That's why shutting down one cell won't do much to shut down other cells. They're resilient, unfortunately. <br>  <br>  We're winning this global war on terrorism, but you have to be patient if you're looking for results. Weeding these guys out is a lot trickier than sending in an air strike in an enemy country's capital... you can see evidence of this in how carefully we have to ensnare them without violating their "rights" as long as they're on American soil. It's frustrating, but beautiful at the same time- these are our founding document at work. They really work, and as long as they do, they're be an America.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	We are surrounded by terrorists and it is political correctness that is allowing it. Is that stupid of what?
4fifI4QFaa	Yes absolutly Casey(not cassie) did kill her. Why would she hide so much stuff and lie after lie after lie. She didnt report Caylee missing for 31 days and while Caylee was missing Casey was out partying at bars. When ur a parent like i am the worst fear u have is that ur child goes missing and i can tell u i would wait to report my child missing and i absolutly wouldnt be out partying. also all the new evidence that has come out lately and also Casey told everybody including her parents that she didnt know where Caylee is but in her gut she said she feels she is close to home..... well Caylee was found close to home.... dead in garbage bags. She treated her daughter like garbage. and why didnt she let her dad in the car because she had caylee in there or the smell of caylee's body was in there. <br>  <br>  Two words  DEATH PENALTY<br>  <br>  Also why she did she tell two different storys? One story she told she said she dropped Caylee off at the babysitters apartment and when she went back the babysitter was gone and so was Caylee and then her second story she told that when she was at Jay blanchard park the babysitter stole Caylee right out her arms?|`|mSt1LGfjaa	sometimes i do and then sometimes i don't,,all the evidence points to her,,why would a mother want to hurt their child,she was beautiful and so innocent,i been on this case since day one and my heart is still broken,,my little angel is gone,,and why,,,now this little haleigh in florida is kidnapped,,what is going on in florida,could this man be the one who got little caylee too.. i just pray they find this baby alive,,|`|C1y4sOfFaa	She did.

Casey is an adorable baby [may she rest in peace] and I don't think she meant to though... i think she got mixed in with drugs and to much alcohol. She needed help but her friends never brought her to an institution as she wished to go to. <br>  <br>  but i don't know why but i think caylee's dad is lee anthony[casey's brother] because caylee look EXACTLY like the two combined. and casey never did tell anyone who the dad was.... <br>  just thought i should throw that in.|`|4P3G4y0Saa	Yes, if she didn't report her baby missing for what a month she did not care about her. Plus she was 2 how many people would know her and who would want to kill her?(besides the mom) It's a yes! Her grandpa went suicide because he missed her so much. Hope i awnsered your question!|`|WW66AkgJaa	because they found her body decomposing and she didn't alert the cops til like three days later... yea she killed her baby.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Yes.

Its worse and tanking fast. The banks and car manufacturers (no one is going to buy those cars,either) are sucking up all the money thrown at them and they are still laying off people and not lending and not making any changes. Having given their CEO's those hugh bonus's from the money. Outrageous! They are all like Bernie Madoff. The sad story today at MSNBC is that poor 90 yr old man-back to work after he lost every dime of his savings through Madoff. I wonder how common, normal people can see how stupid it is to give them more money-throwing money down a rat hole-and the experts, financiers and politicians can't see it. They want to bankrupt the country and issue in the One World Gov't by bringing us down, I guess, thats the reason?|`|R49w1Dr7aa	It ain't good   =(
abJFBd7daa	I saw the cartoon and had to be asked “who does the monkey represent”? I never thought it was Obama! This knee jerk reaction to call everything under the sun racist is pathetic. Does racism exist? Of course it does and I don’t expect it will perish anytime soon as long as we perceive everything as a matter of being racial. I’m surprised no one is boycotting the billiard industry. What? You don’t see the racism in the green table representing the earth? The fact that the WHITE ball knocks the YELLOW ball off the table, then the RED ball. Then the game is won when the white ball knocks the BLACK ball off the table. Hmmmmm? Obviously everyone who plays pool is racist right?!   <br>  <br>  Or maybe someone just likes to play the game and maybe someone saw the cartoon and didn’t see Obama in the cartoon. Maybe the people who see racism are infact racist themselves and just looking for pudding heads to agree with them. <br>  <br>  That's my honest answer!|`|NvrVjOhBaa	What's the political statement? That it's OK to assassinate the president because he signed off on a bill that not everyone agrees with? I think some might be pushing it with the monkey = African Americans deal because they likely aren't associating it with the recent event involving the animal, but still. It was very classless.<br>  <br>  For the record, I don't agree with the movie made in the UK about Bush either.|`|AA12144825	If you don't care, it won't matter.|`|v6AFCH7uaa	I think whatever the intentions of the cartoon may have been, you can't ignore the historical racist associations and connotations of the cartoon. If the trajectory of our history was different and racist drawings and thought likening black people to baboons and apes never happened, then this wouldn't be an issue. On a different note: I think this a prime example of stupidity on the part of so many people. The editors made a really bad decision. And for those who defend it as satire, well, let's just say it's intelligence level has sunk down to lowest common denominator which sadly seems to be case in so many aspects of American life like TV (it's hard to believe people waste their time watching things like "The Real Housewives" or so many other like minded sh*T), music, literature (although i cringe to call genres like "chic lit" anything remotely resembling literature). Good satire should exude irony, intelligence, subtlety. This cartoon is ignorant of past associations and is as subtle as a sledgehammer.<br>  <br>  **I know what the NY Post has said about what the cartoon is supposed to be about, but the point of a political cartoon shouldn't have to come with an manual describing it's intentions. Unfortunately, whether or not the cartoon's INTENTION was racist or not, without an explanation of it from the editorial board, the potential for misinterpretation of the cartoon is far greater because of the sensitivity of past historical associations. Plus, even with the explanation, it isn't particularly funny, astute, or clever - but then again, that's why it's the NY Post publishing this crap (for those of you who don't live in NY, it's basically a tabloid paper), not the The New Yorker.|`|cZZUfXNvaa	i am sure he was giving a secret code message for somebody to kill the president, just like the did with JFK.|`|DgLBtjWoaa	You guys have it all wrong. The chimp wasn't Obama. They were just saying that the stimulus bill was poorly put together, "so bad, even a caveman could do it"... remember those Geico commercials? Like that, but with a chimp instead of a caveman. <br>  <br>  There are just too many people who are all too willing to extend their index finger and scream "RACISM! I SAW RACISM, DAMMIT!" and it's not anywhere near as prevalent as these people would like to think.<br>  <br>  The cartoonist was saying that the bill was junk, and he was playing on a current event, the one where the lady's chimp was shot and killed earlier in the week.... you know, like that chimp was the person who wrote the bill<br>  <br>  If you don't take anything else away from what I've written, keep this in mind: OBAMA DIDN'T WRITE THE BILL. PELOSI AND REID WROTE THE BILL. BILLS START IN CONGRESS AND ARE SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE PRESIDENT. It wasn't a commentary on the president, it was a commentary on the authors of the bill: Congress.<br>  <br>  C'mon people, check your emotions at the door and refer back to what you learned in 9th grade social studies. Think first.|`|AA10008572	It's really a bad situation all around. Where's the humor? It was racist because it shows two cops shooting a gorilla (Obama). What's worst the cops shooting or Obama as a gorilla. It was implied that he wrote the stimulus package. The chimp attack was a real tragedy because the chimp was killed and the poor woman had her face ripped off and and her hands destroyed by that beast.|`|n2eOdOm8aa	People making a big deal out of nothing.<br>  <br>  It is congress that writes the rules.

VfowGdWLaa	Good question. I think the best person to answer this question would be an honest person that practices Islam and clears it out for all of us. We usually hear two versions of this answer. One that Islam is a religion of love. Second, that Islam teaches its followers to kill the infidels meaning everyone that does not follow the teachings of its founder. Its also been said that Islam preaches against Israel. But, only an honest Islamic can clarify this for the ones that have not studied the Quran.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	And that's not counting the war he's waging on the American people!|`|BWvIllhKaa	How is that making him a warmonger? How is that making him go mad? I find it pretty sad that people are so quick to forget since Obama got elected that 9/11 was done by al quaeda and that the war in afghanistan was to get back at them and then defeat them and the talibans. That war is not won. It was stopped right in the middle to go to Iraq. And I'm sorry to burst your bubble but most of the fighters now in afghanistan were there BEFORE the Iraq war. The talibans haven't move out of there. They have always been there. Al quaeda are at the afghani-pakistani border. Saying that there are from Iraq is pure lies! Obama is getting more troops in afghanistan to finish the right war. The war that was never won or finished. If you think otherwise, I guess you do not want to go after the ones who did 9/11. The ones who indeed attacked the USA. The enemy. Or I guess you just want them to be left alone over there so that they can plot another one.|`|AA12292803	WEREN'T YOU THE PEOPLE WHO WELCOMED HIM AS A MESSIAH THINKING WOW THIS MAN IS REALLY GOOD,DONT YOU REALIZE THAT ITS THE BEAUROCRICY THAY RUNS YOUR COUNTRY AND ALL WESTERN GOVERNMENTS,|`|yUuS0uCWaa	AIPAC is responsible|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	You know President Obama is not a war monger.  We all know who the war monger was Former President Bush.   Republicans are the really greedy selfish ones.  Bush was the one after oil.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	-You're kidding, right ?! If sending 17,000 troops to Afganistan to kill off the Taliban who backed Bin Laden makes Obama a "war monger", WHAT was Bush when HE sent 135,000 troops to Iraq to take out Saddam Hussein because he felt "threatend" by Him ??!  :0|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	George Bush  diversified out efforts with an unnecessary war in Iraq, where there was no Al Qaeda under Saddam. What have we accomplished in Afghanistan during the past 7 years since 9/11? Nothing, Al Qaeda has grown in strength. Your aim is probably to bash Obama, but this really bringing out Bush's mistakes.|`|PmG0Isnnaa	Yes,<br>   <br>  He has waged war against the American economy and Capitalism with the mistaken communist notion that Government can solve all problems.  He is taking freedom away from individual Americans and making those who play by the rules bail out those who don't.|`|57d4f2697917e4b39ee6da4458cc830eaa	If only people had voted for McCain. If McCain had won there wouldn't be 17000 troops going to Afghanistan.|`|AA10527991	You obviously don't like President Obama.  Fine.  But to call him a war monger is absurd and you know it.
R49w1Dr7aa	It is a reminder...never again. <br>  <br>  I see that you are Black. Slavery happened much longer ago than the Holocaust and Americans hear about slavery daily.<br>  <br>  Don't you have a nose to pick?|`|XU5SVQZDaa	Because its a real reminder-it could happen again in this country or any country. The memory is kept alive as a warning to us alive now. Don't be naive and think those kind of people like Hitler are dead-that evil spirit is alive and well.|`|FCwtMDBSaa	Those who forget history tend to repeat it. I don't think we should forget tragedies of history|`|tguEmxVyaa	You're forced to read Holocaust articles? Just don't read them.|`|V7JVKApkaa	Holocaust is not a registered trademark, so you using that symbol illustrates a certain degree of hostility regarding the issue. <br>  <br>  Your inner demons are sneaking through, and not so subtly.
57d4f2697917e4b39ee6da4458cc830eaa	Does anyone remember exactly how high the water level around New York has to rise before all the subways flood? I seem to recall that a Category 3 hurricane travelling far enough up the East Coast could do that.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	It's worse than that. Most don't even know that the people who bought most of these failed housing loans didn't even have jobs. Their income was limited to welfare money. The federal courts had ruled several years ago in a Colorado case that welfare could be counted as income to purchase a house. That's the reason for most of the foreclosures. I could tell you volumes on this subject as my girlfriend is a real estate attorney and has been 39 years. She has been telling me for 10 years that the bottom would eventually fall out and it did. What the government forced banks to do would have gotten any individual life in prison. Guess what. This bail out plan is nothing more than giving more money to the same people to have the same crap happen again  with the exception of the new added on freebees they get with the bailout money. Same plan different day. It sucks because it will mega fail next time. Liberals are our biggest enemy.|`|TX5uV9bIaa	If the neighbor hood has houses and they go for 500K, then go down to 350K, everybody lost money.  But if one of those people bought it and financed it with a loan for 400K then they are "upside down" and owe more than it is worth.  But if the bank sees that they are still making payments...well, the bank has no problem and so does not offer a solution.  They actually COUNSEL the people to let it go into foreclosure so that it will qualify for a bailout.<br>  <br>  But if there is money to be given out, who should get it?  The Bank...to pay down the loan to 'fair market'?  Or the homeowner to pay it down to 'affordable' levels?  Actually they'd be better off taking the money and applying it to buy another discounted house and let the bank have the old one back...<br>  <br>  But I have to agree...if you are going to comment on stuff and get quoted, and if you are going to try and "spin" it...you ought to at least be coherent.<br>  <br>  But you have not yet seen the end of the digging.  I hear it will take $2 Trillion in additional commitments for the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debacles.<br>  <br>  We are being stampeded and manipulated into doing things that are NOT good "for everybody".
AA12292803	economies go up and go down ,its the way its been for 2000 years or more,we just have to ride it out just like before,newspaper are to blame for creating mass hysteria by printing the doom and gloom,maybe they should change their attitude start some positive thinking,but that wont happen ,i never believe anything that the newspaper say,they usually tell only part of the story,if people were to go along on their normal way of living things will change,but remember this we in the western countries really know nothing of real poverty,|`|Zqbfw2bkaa	LOOK UP THE ILLUMINATI AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER WRITTEN CIRCA 1700'S THEN MAP OUT THEIR PLANS ALONG WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. IT GETS KINDA SCARY. BANKS, MEDIA, ITS ALL THERE. AND I GET A CHILL WHEN U.S. POLITICIANS USE THE TERM (NEW WORLD ORDER) AS COMMON AS IT SOUNDS TODAY IT HAS A DEEPER MEANING. LOOK IT UP IT'LL SCARE THE HELL OUTA YA AND MAYBE PEOPLE WILL READ THIS AND CHANGE THINGS.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I don't know if the sky is falling but I sure wouldn't sell my gun. That is the next move on the Obama agenda. They won't ban guns but will come in thru your back door and tell you that you have to have a million dollars worth of insurance if you own a gun. they might put a limit on how much ammunition you can purchase. They have lots of plans.<br>  <br>  I know I got off the subject but I am a big 2nd Amendment person and they are going to push crazy laws. You might be wise to keep it.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	DO NOT sell your gun right now --- No I am not some conspiracy, end of the world, the sky is falling type but facts are facts.... The economy is contracting...... If it gets real bad crime will go up so keeping your firearm around right now would be smart.... Practice with it -- It's no good if you aren't comfortable with it....<br>  <br>  As part of your defense package keep a shotgun handy too.....
