20090220121304AAojBsI	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	I'm pregnant and need vegetarian sources of iron?	I have pretty bad morning sickness and although I'm not normally a vegetarian, I can't keep meat down- especially red meats. Fish is even worse, and I'm having a problem with eggs too. The problem is I know my body really needs iron, and I have a tendency to be anemic. I can't handle iron pills (I vomit within minutes) - but I can handle a high iron coated multivitamin, so that's what I've been taking.       What can I eat that will help with iron levels? I can eat most other foods, or force myself to if I have to :) thanks a lot!

20090203034152AAZhiBV	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Question about making soup?	I'm going to make some soup.  It's going to have stew meat, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, celery, onion, and a little tomato sauce.  (That's what my husband likes).  I know how to make the soup, that's no big deal. I just have trouble with the stew meat always being very chewy or rubbery.  I'm using lean stew meat, purchased already cut up.  Is there something I need to do to make it tender?  I usually start off by browning it, then adding the onion and cooking it a few minutes more until the onion is tender.  Then I add in the carrots with water (since they take the longest to cook) then potatoes...then celery and cabbage last (since they get tender the quickest).  The meat ends up simmering for at least an hour overall.  I just don't know if that's too long or not long enough.  I'm also willing to marinate it or something like that first, if need be.  Any ideas?  Tell me what you do!  Thanks!

I've been eating this store-bought potato salad and I'd really like to my own.      As far as I can tell, it's got potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, some sort of thick dressing, a little bit of red peppers, onion, and celery. All the veggies are very fine; I like it that way.      What I need to know is, how do I make this? I've never made potato salad before, and I really want to make mine kind of like what I've been getting. How do you make the dressing?      Thanks!

20090220124531AAw83PA	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How does make hot fudge sauce WITHOUT corn syrup or cream of tartar?	I live in Europe and it is not easy to find (although not impossible either, just costly and time consuming to do). Also, so far, I have been raising my child on mostly organic foods and when it comes to sweets, we make everything from scratch. A good basic recipe that would allow an easy substitute such as honey or maple syrup would be ideal.
20090220124532AAQuHwi	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Alcohol, Alcohol, Alcohol - who discovered it and why…!?	I didn’t know that I am going to deal with this in my life until I met my boyfriend. We have been together for a little bit over a year. We are in our 40i’s. He drinks every single day... He doesn’t get drunk daily (only sometimes) but he has to have a glass of hard alcohol. Even he keeps a small bottle in his car and for example if we go skiing he will get a sip while we are getting ready for skiing. He never does it in front of me but I can smell it. I did confront him twice and he admitted that he has an alcohol problem but still drinks. I told him that I don’t want to be in a relationship with a guy who drinks daily but he keeps drinking. I am not sure what to do. Actually I do know that if he doesn’t stop I am going to leave him. I really like him, he is a really nice guy but this alcohol is my big issue. I told him that I am scared that I am going to lose him because of the alcohol but nothing changes… Obviously, he doesn’t care about me…  It’s time to do something…I want to give a try. I have been reading a lot online for all the alcohol issues that people have and the different ways to deal with it … Any help will be appreciated

20090220125916AAissZB	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Is it legal for shops to refuse selling alcohol to holders of non-british passports?	Hello!      I'm visiting UK for several weeks. I'm 21 and I was refused in buying alcohol quite a few times. I presented my passport with which I entered the UK (it is Russian). I was told that the only acceptable form of ID is British passport or some PASS cards. These cards can be issued for UK residents after some legal procedure.      So is that right that if a young person is visiting the UK he cannot drink beer in a pub?      I was refused to buy some beer in a Wetherspoon pub and Marks and Spencer store. Strange country :-/      Could anyone please explain me. Thank you      Best regards,   Roman
