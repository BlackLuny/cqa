20090226194020AAhTqLk	Politics & Government;Elections	Why is "moment of conception" important in the abortion debate?	In my opinion, this matter is irrelevent. The mother is the sole decider in whether or not her baby that she carries should be born or not, right before she gives birth.  There are even a few crazies here who think abortion should be illegal in cases of pre-eclampsia, rape, or incest. Practically every Western nation with the exception of devoutly Catholic Poland and Ireland provide abortion on demand. The only countries in the world that still consider abortion illegal are either in Catholic Latin America or the Muslim Middle East. Colorado residents recently voted to reject a "moment of conception" measure by a resounding 75%. Even conservative South Dakota voted 55% to reject abortion limits. Do pro-lifers realize they are fighting a war they cannot win?

20090226194436AA34Gwi	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Question about felony credit card theft... PLEASE HELP!!?	I'm 17. I was living in Kentucky with my boyfriend who is 23 over the summer. We had our own place. I was 8 months pregnant, just had my baby girl in December. Basically... my boyfriend and his friend were a bunch of drunk control freaks and when I accidently came home from work with some lady's credit card in with my papers and schedule and stuff, they found it. Then my boyfriend threatened me into using it saying he would throw me out and leave me and crap and it was just me and him down there... I had nowhere else to go. He had me get him a TV, videogames, and really a bunch of stuff I'd never need/want. I got caught and got charged as a juvenile with felony credit card fraud and misdeamenor theft by unlawful taking. I didn't go to court, I got a court designated worker and they were going to set me up with community service and probably a fine. Well, before I got my "sentence" we ended up having to leave the state cause we lost our apartment since I lost my job and was having complications in my pregnancy. We moved back home with his parents. How can I resolve this? Since I am a juvenile will employers see that on my record when I try to find a job now? Will it follow me out of state and can I get arrested for it still? Would I possibly be able to do the community service here?

I live in USA but dislike much about it -- the marriage laws in most states, the lack of community, high crime rates and the gestapo-like policies of the INS for visas.  I'm a 56 year old female with no degree but I have a lot of experience in job training (trained co-workers) and tutoring school subjects.  I have 100% success rate with these.  Very interested in teaching ESL but all the ads I've seen involve temporary contracts.  Why is this if native English speaking ESL teachers are in such demand?!  I want to get at least PR in a country ASAP.  I plan to move to this country with my fiance who is from Nepal, age 35, bachelor's degree in Marketing, but has only entry-level experience as a retail clerk.  He expects to receive a diploma in social services in the near future.  I expect to receive USA social security at age 65 but would like to work both before and after.  My dream is to own and manage a boardinghouse.  Currently half owner of a property in USA worth almost $400,000 which should be sold in the near future.  I can live spartanly, but not poor.  I'm comfortable driving a big old SUV and my only luxury is a cosmetic surgery every two years or so.  My fiance and I need an area in a country that offers at least PR,  with low-crime, and either easy driving or safe public transportation.  To top if off, I have a back disability which limits the time I can sit and stand, so I may require a special workstation with a reclining chair.  I don't know if we can learn a foreign language in time.  My fiance is working towards fluent English, partly with my help.  .......Where to and how?  Any hope for us????

20090226195939AAGWwwX	Politics & Government;Politics	Cutting the top rate BOOSTED tax revenue - so why would raising the top rate also boost tax revenue?	Every news outlet is reporting that President Obama plans to "pay for part of his deficit reduction (from $1.4BN mind you) by letting the Bush tax cuts for the rich expire."    Call the tax cuts whatever you want, but the fact is that tax revenue INCREASED dramatically after the tax RATE cuts went into effect (because taxpayers reinvested the initial tax savings, and realized taxable gains on that reinvestment).   So, why would we assume that undoing a policy that raised revenue would also raise revenue?   That seems illogical.

So if anyone could point me into the direction where I can get an idea of the SCALE of things there that'd be awesome.      (looking for current stuff such as the stats for 2008 and such)

20090226201827AADBAZ1	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What are some good ways to get revenge on a neighbor who constantly takes your parking spot?	My neighbor, whom I call Ladysuit (because she looks like Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire), INSISTS on parking RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE the two parking spaces in front of our apartment building.  This makes it impossible for me to park anywhere near my house unless I get there first.      There is ample space for two cars, but she doesn't seem to get that whole "back up or pull up a few feet in either direction so another car can squeeze in" thing.       I always make sure to leave enough room for her.      I tried to confront her about this, but she flaked out and went inside her house (possibly because she is an alien dressed in a ladysuit and she didn't want me to get too close).      Also, she's fukcing weird looking.      Now I'm out for blood.  Ideas?

20090226200010AA4IFDg	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does everyone think Gitmo was so bad?!?	Okay heres all i have to say: Yes America used torture, and yes thats a horrible thing. But there are exceptions to everything.       Most of the detainees were the worst terrorists the Taliban and Al-Qaeda could throw at us. Torture was a means to an end. These terrorists needed to be punished, these people needed to be removed from anything even reminicent of normal society- even executed in some cases. I don't see how people can frown upon the torture of the 9/11 'masterminds'. The torture of people who wanted to kill innocent Americans simply for our culture, our way of life, and our freedom.       Yes every life is a life- but is every life equal? If the terrorists don't seem to think so, why should we? Did they think every life was equal when they attacked the World Trade Centers? Or the innocent people in Madrid? Or the hundreds of children in Beslan, Russia in 2004? I feel like whatever happens there- they deserve. All they had to do to avoid it, was to not end dozens of lives.      I see bumper stickers, signs, and clothing all over that say things like: "9/11: Never Forget". Has America forgotten?

20090226195826AAXTgM4	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Concerned Granddaughter Looking for Legal Advice in maybe a Negligent Doctor Case?	Please only answer if you are somewhat educated in the legal or medical field.      My Grandfather is currently in the hospital. The doctors say he has a blood infection and it has damaged his pace maker and they are considering removing his left leg (because that's were the infection is coming from as far as I can gather) They also told us if he would have been dead in a few days if they had not found this blood infection.      Now, for the last six months or so he has been experiencing these seizure like episodes, I know they are not real seizure, but that's the best way I can describe them because of the way he shakes, from head to toe, during which he has trouble breathing yet he can still talk. They can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes.   Last year after getting most of his left lung removed from cancer, he got a blood infection and the doctors had to take out his artificial left knee and gave him a pick (sp?) line where he had to have antibiotics every 8 hours and after about three months they gave him a new knee.      These 'shaking episodes' started shortly after. His old doctor kept trying to give him different medication, ( to stop the shakes) nothing seemed to work. My grandfather asked him to take some of his blood and test it, but his doctor told him "You don't need a blood culture (sp?) If you had a blood infection you'd be dead by now"      Finally, my Grandfather decided to get a new doctor. He went for an appointment on a Friday (20th) and he got a call Saturday (21st) morning telling him to go to the hospital. He had a blood infection.      So, now to my question (thank you for taking the time to read this and get this far) is there anything I can do to make sure that doctor doesn't do anything like this to another patient? I live with my Grandparents and I have watched my Grandpa suffer and it just makes my blood boil to know a simple blood test would have told us what was wrong with him.         Again thanks for your help. I tried to write as much as I could that I thought would help.   Any information or ideas are most welcome.

20090225123253AAt3HvR	Politics & Government;Government	Would this be a supportable Amendment?	I think, in light of all the talk about 'trimming' government programs that don't work, that we should add an amendment that reads as follows:      -->The Federal Government shall be required every 2 years to provide a Cost-Effectiveness Review of each government program based on the stated purpose of the program or as delegated directly to the Senate by the Constitution. If such programs do not provide a justifiable benefit, or are not delegated to the Senate by the Constitution, then they shall be diminished and ultimately abolished before the time of the next Review. Any such Treasury Revenue intended for abolished Federal Programs shall at that time revert to the States, and the Federal Taxes levied shall reflect the reduced Federal burden.        This would keep Federal growth to a minimum, while ensuring that the States could finance their local aspirations. Also, I don't know what the exact standards should be...that's why I post the question. Basically my intention is to allow the States the ability to govern themselves as is stated in the Constitution. Read it.       Now maybe there are certain issues that we don't want entrusted to the states because surely some would allow this, others would not, but isn't that the point? We ought to be able to move to seek better opportunities in life, but how can this happen if a centralized Federal Gov has spread it wings and cast all 50 states under it's shadow?

From my point of view I am not seeing how what he is doing is helping the middle class. Seems the majority of the money is going to company's and CEO's to do what they want with it (including throwing extravagant parties, sprucing up office space, and buying corporate jets). I think the money should have went more towards the American people.....I mean it is our money after all. I dont know how true it is but I heard the only thing an average middle class working man can look forward to is an extra $8 a week in his weekly paycheck (gee, thanks). I am extremely upset that the middle class is not getting any real help. If I am wrong, can someone explain to me what I am missing and how are the middle class going to benefit from the bail out?

20090225122317AAVfe1X	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do I have enough to file an lawsuit? If yes, with whom?	In the summer of last year I have been accused by an co-worker (women who I turned down) of being sexually aggressive, racist (Jews), threatening, etc. Even though those charges have been dismissed and I have been cleared of any wrong doing by my employer who spearheaded the investigation.  Fast forward to now, that same individual who filled the previous charges bad-mouthed me in front of another co-worker who also happens to be close with the residential director of the program I work for.  She claimed that I was about to punch her in her face and that I threatened and intimidated her on a separate occasion. Now the same investigative team investigated those charges, after an investigation which was clearly tainted by only looking for information that would hurt me in addition they revived the old charges. As I challenged that notion with union help they agreed to drop those charges and offered to let me of the hook on some lesser violations. Still after countless meeting's insults, etc I think that the damage has been done, and I am still being disciplined on something they had to look very hard for to find it (sleeping on the job on two separate occasions)    Point being is that I feel at this point somewhat harassed since I have never done any of those things. Do I have a basis for a lawsuit against the company, or at least any criminal charges against those two who instigated the whole thing?

20090226201627AAKoEz7	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Exactly how does a taser work?	I've always heard that it's not 'voltage' in that sense, but that it simply sends confusing signals to the central nervous system and temporarily makes a person kind of have involuntary movements so that they can't really control their muscles. Yet they advertise them in varying voltages from like 20,000 volts up to 1,000,000+ volts. It runs off from a 9-volt battery, from what I've seen. People in schools have touched 9 volt batteries to their tongues to feel the tingle out of curiosity - it didn't hurt them. This is the same little battery that goes in a smoke detector and countless other low-power units.      So...how does this 9-volt battery deliver such a shock? Is there some kind of hardware that converts the battery's energy into signals that the body can understand, to confuse signals between the brain and central nervous system? Or is it a literal electric shock?       Are there some kind of step-up transistors in it or something? It is a bit hard for me to grasp the concept that a 9V battery can stun a person, regardless of how much it is 'stepped up' via a transistor. Can anyone help me out with that? I'm asking because I just saw a video where a guy died from supposedly being tasered just 2 or 3 times. Yet I'm wondering how this could be unless he had health problems.

A gold medel to Sam Moffett for saving the lives of three people while a heavy snowstorm was taking place and he got a ticket for jaywalking. He and another guy got off and helped this two old ladies cross the road safety and ensured her safety. How stupid were these cops! They should have not ticketed this guy. In Chatham-Kent, Canada they have a courtesy cruiser program where residents can call in to thank a good samaritian for a random act of traffic kindness.      The guy should be honoured, not ticketed?      Here is the entire story:      A good Samaritan who helped push three people out of the path of a pickup truck before being struck and injured has gotten a strange reward for his good deed: A jaywalking ticket.      Family members said 58-year-old bus driver Jim Moffett and another man were helping two elderly women cross a busy Denver street in a snowstorm when he was hit Friday night.      Moffett suffered bleeding in the brain, broken bones, a dislocated shoulder and a possible ruptured spleen. He was in serious but stable condition Wednesday.      The Colorado State Patrol issued the citation. Trooper Ryan Sullivan said that despite Moffett's intentions, jaywalking contributed to the accident.      Moffett had been driving his bus when the two women got off. In the interest of safety, he got out and, together with another passenger, helped the ladies cross.      Moffett's stepson, Ken McDonald, said the driver of the pickup plowed into his stepfather, but not before Moffett pushed the two women out of the way.      When he awoke in intensive care, he learned of the ticket. "His reaction was dazed and confused. I was a little angry," said McDonald.      The other man also was cited for jaywalking, while the pickup driver was cited with careless driving that led to injury. Sullivan said the two elderly women haven't been cited but the investigation is ongoing.      Stupid eh? These cops should know better, they should be ordered to scrap those tickets.

20090226213624AAuZYEf	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Bobby Jindal's "rebuttal" speech... Yea or nay?	I thought it was poorly thought out, unstructured, and parts irrelevant...   Granted... He did follow undeniably one of, if not THE greatest orator in the world... but still...   Also, I was fairly offended when he said that they shouldn't fund volcano research... I live within 100 miles of Mount St. Helens, and she's been in a constant eruptive state since 2005, so if she has an eruption close to the side of the one in 1980, and no research is done to be able to warn us about it, I'm in trouble...      So, in a format somewhat similar to mine, what did you think about his speech...

For example: Eagle Scout (But I'm already one step away from Eagle). Just in general what things should I do to better prepare myself for the CIA and exceed the minimum requirements.

20090226194407AAJExta	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Hypothetical situation...?	Alright, this hypothetical situation deals with the obtaining of evidence during a police search. I need to know whether or not if it has been legally obtained. Ok, the situation is as follows:      A warrant is obtained to search the premises of a high school student (Sam) who is suspected to have poisoned the drinks of a couple of peers at a party. The item that they are searching for is Rolypnol (aka "roofies"). When the police officer arrives, he discovers that the Sam is not there, but a friend visiting for the weekend is there alone. This friend does not have equal or greater ownership rights to the property, but he gives the police officer consent to enter and search the house. During the search, he notices a computer in plain sight. He notices a bunch of numbers and a pharse on a screensaver, he asks Sam's friend to look at the computer. It depicts various credit card numbers and the saying "I Got Your Number". He immediately suspects credit card fraud (Which it is not, it is just the name of a local band that Sam enjoys). He accidentally bumps the table, and the screen saver disappears, and reveals a peom or phrase typed by Sam. The message reads "It is such sweet irony when the victim becomes the victor. It's such sweet revenge when those who victimize become victims themselves". The police officer thought this may be related to the crime (It was no secret that Sam was treated unfairly from the two poisoned students, which explains the officer's suspicion.) The officer then printed the document and took it as evidence. He then recieved a warrant to seize the computer.         Ok, thats it. Thank you for taking the time to read that. Now, my question is: Was the document printed off the computer seized legally, or is it illegal, therefor not admissable in court? Thank you for your time.

What if I say no and my background check shows that I lied, can I be fined? I am probably going to tell them I am not ready for MEPS, and I think we should wait until we have these records. Also, is it even possible to get a waiver for a DUI if I had cocaine in my system? Its on record, and I just think its f##% up that the president can admit to past cocaine use but it may DQ me from the service.

I know what his plan is though, he feels that when everything falls apart he is just going to blame it on either racism or Bush, but things are so bad within only a month… I don’t even think the Democrats are going to believe it.

20090226212526AAjDc8o	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can jails legally only accept Christian literature and not of any other religion?	A friend of a friend is in jail. I don't know why he's there and would rather not get into that subject about that guy as an individual. My friend brought his roommate who is in jail a novel titled "The Golden Buddha" which had nothing to do with the religion. The jail here allows people to bring inmates books. Since they thought the book had to do with Buddhism they rejected it's entry and told my friend that books having to do with religion could only be based on Christianity. I realize people in jail lack certain rights but didn't think the jail could dictate a particular religion or favor one over another. I thought you either allow books or you don't and if you allow one religion you have to allow all religions, beliefs, and creeds. Isn't that against the U.S. Constitution and discrimination of religion and mixing religion and politics/church and state? What if the inmate were Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Atheist, Agnostic, Wiccan, Pagan, or even a Satanist? Does this seem like an issue his incarcerated roommate could get the ACLU involved in?

IS THIS GUY INSANE?     http://thinkprogress.org/2009/02/25/schu...        http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/20...       Today, Colorado State Sen. Dave Schultheis (R) caused outrage by announcing that he would vote against a bill requiring HIV tests for pregnant women because the disease "stems from sexual promiscuity" and he doesn't think the government should reward "unacceptable behavior." Schultheis explained his motives before casting the lone vote against the bill:      "We do things continually to remove the negative consequences that take place from poor behavior and unacceptable behavior, quite frankly, and I don't think that's the role of this body.      As a result of that I finally came to the conclusion I would have to be a no vote on this because this stems from sexual promiscuity for the most part, and I just can't vote on this bill and I wanted to explain to this body why I was going to be a no vote on this."

Scott Renfroe, of Greeley, used biblical references in linking murder and homosexuality during debate on a bill to extend health benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian state workers.      ---------------------------   and these guys are US Senators??

We were having a fight at the time and I called the police on him.  He was charged with misdemeanor child endangerment.  My objective at the time was to force him into counseling because he had been an abused child himself and I didn't want that legacy to be passed down to my children.  It worked, the courts forced him into anger management classes, he resisted and they slapped him back into jail so when that happened he went to the group therapy, learned the lessons they had to teach and I've had no more problems with him with respect to anything like that.      However now it is on his record and he feels that it may be preventing him from getting a job with those who do background checks.  This was 14 years ago, my son is almost grown now and could verify that his father never repeated anything like that since, nor has he harmed or touched in any wrong way any other children.

20070312161346AAEU6eq	Politics & Government;Politics	Hey, did you hear about the Gathering this weekend in DC?	What: Gathering of Eagles       When: March 17th, 2007   0700-1600 (7 AM to 4 PM)       Where: The Vietnam Veteran's Memorial Wall, Washington D.C.       Why: To stand silent guard over our nation's memorials, in honor of our fallen, and in solidarity with our armed forces in harm's way today.      Taken from Mission Statement:   7. We vehemently oppose the notion that it is possible to “support the troops but not the war.” We are opposed to those groups who would claim support for the troops yet engage in behavior that is demeaning and abusive to the men and women who wear our nation’s uniform.

I am 14 and I am going into High School next year, so I've been thinking of the classes I can take. I'm interested in eventually going to the United States Naval Academy, and becoming maybe a Submarine Officer or a pilot. So basically, would it be possible to go that route and get a degree in Political Science, and after a few years in the Navy running for public office such as senator or governor (yes I have big dreams :D)? Would that make sense? I have been researching past presidents and found that some went to the naval academy. i want to either go that route, or maybe astronaut, or law enforcement. Again, I have big dreams but I feel I am smart enough and self-confident enough to get there. Thank you.

20090225124133AAvcHIx	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it illegal to videotape someone with your cell phone in school without their consent?	Hi, I'm an 8th grade student at my local middle school. Two weeks ago in school, I did something very stupid with my friend. We were having a test in Chorus class (Individual singing) and we were bored so we decided to videotape some of the people singing so we could combine them into one video for fun. I only videotaped two or three people and deleted the videos later because I thought it would be stupid, but I'm not sure about my friend. So just today, I was called down to the principal's office with my friend and he said it was illegal to do this. it was one thing that we had our phones out and were hiding it behind our books but it was another to record people. We expected our phones to be taken away and for us to maybe get a week of detention but no. the principal told us that they never dealt with this problem before so he had to have time to think. Then he came to us and told us that he has to have a meeting with our parents and we MIGHT end up getting a few days of suspension. Please give me your input!!!

I figger I'll start the bowl rollin by seein how good I practice what I preach.  I will bring out my copy of the Good Book, Exodus 34:11–27 and refresh my remembery on perzackly what ol God wants from me.      Commandment Number One: 11 Observe what I command you today. See, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  12 Take care not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it will become a snare among you.  13 You shall tear down their altars, break their pillars, and cut down their sacred poles.      My Grade: F daggum it.  I looked all over for them ol Canaanite and Jebusite and Perruzite and Leverite poles and pillars and whutnot to bust up but I could only find me a tent ground full of girl scouts so I went and cut down all them tent poles and the girl scouts got all mad and screamy and two cops came and hauled my sorry butt to jail.      Commandment Number Two: 14 (for you shall worship no other god, because the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God).      My Grade: A.  I don't even worship God, so I'm good on this one.      Commandment number three: You shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone among them will invite you, and you will eat of the sacrifice.  16 And you will take wives from among their daughters for your sons, and their daughters who prostitute themselves to their gods will make your sons also prostitute themselves to their gods.      My Grade: A+.  I aint took none of them Perruzite or Hittite or Holdtite wimmen as my wife on account of I caint find them Perruzits nowhere no how.  I bet they're hot though do you think that ol Sarah Palin is a Hittite woman or whut.      Commandment Number Four: 17 You shall not make cast idols.      My Grade: A+.  All the idols I made wuz made out of mud so I am OK on this one.      Commandment Number Four: 18 You shall keep the festival of unleavened bread.

I aint eatin no unleavened bread. And WTF is Abib I don't wear no bib them's for babies.        Commandment Number Five: 19 All that first opens the womb is mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.  20 The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.  No one shall appear before me empty-handed.      My Grade: F-.  WTF!?  Why is God so greedy to git my first born donkey?  Since he's God and everything let him get his own self his own dam ol donkey he caint have mine.      Commandment Number Six:  21 For six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in ploughing time and in harvest time you shall rest.  22 You shall observe the festival of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year.      My Grade: C.  I get a A for not workin on Sundays hail I don't work during the week but WTF is all these dam festivals I don't celebrate?      Commandment Number Seven: 23 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.  24 For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year.      My Grade: F.  Hail I aint appearin before God no three times a year.  As it is I got to see the parole lady every month on account of that misunderstandin with the girl scouts.      Commendment Number Eight:  25 You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice of the festival of the passover shall not be left until the morning.      My Grade: A.  I don't put no leaven in my sacrifice on account of I dont do no sacrifice.      Commandment Number Nine:  26 The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God.      My Grade: F.  I'm keepin all my fruits for my own self.      Commandment Number Ten:  You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.  27 The Lord said to Moses: Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.      My Grade: A.  I am all over that not boilin kids in their mommas' milk.      Overall I give me a A+ at followin God's commandments.  How bout you?

One of my other friends (guy) wanted to hang out and so I went to my other friend's (guy) house. At 10am the next morning, I received a text message from my friend (girl) saying that she threw my suitcase and bag outside on her lawn at 3:00am. A bunch of items went missing. I still have the text messages proving she threw them outside. Is she responsible for them? Should I take her to court for it?
20080129142259AAb2Goo	Politics & Government;Politics	O que vc acha da atitude deste deputado????	Na última segunga (28/01), o Jornal da Globo colocou no ar uma  matéria  com  o  deputado  estadual  paranaense Luis Cláudio  Romaneli  (PMDB),  ensinando  como   passar  no pedágio sem pagar. (  http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/s/29012008/...  ).   O que vcs acham da atitude deste legislador paranaense?     molecagem, malandragem, falta de caráter ou fruto de um estado de necessidade, já que os pedágios s?o t?o caros e ele ganha t?o pouco???      Também pergunto: o que esse imbecil espera que nós fa?amos deste País quando os próprios legisladores cuspem nas suas leis??

20081010191248AAVe7oU	Politics & Government;Elections	Do you think Obama understands commerce?	Small business and large business (read BIG evil villans) are the employers of this country.  It is the people who produce goods and services that create wealth etc and an economy for the govt to be able to govern anything in the first place.  Why does it seem that so many do not understand this and think govt is the solution to all our problems?

20090128090432AAJWSOp	Politics & Government;Elections	How can putting billions into infrastructure really help the economy in the short term?	Can someone please explain this one to me? Does anyone really know how long it takes to build a bridge, tunnel, or highway? It takes FOREVER! Well, several years anyway. You have to go through multiple stages of deciding where it will go, then residents complain, hold meetings, and take it to court because the highway is going through their neighborhood and they don't want to move. After a few years of legal battles, somebody finally gets screwed and the route is set. Then they have to make sure they follow all the environmental protection guidelines because God help them if a freakin' eastern spotted rat lives in the path of the highway. then, after years of designing, negotiating, buying land, and politicians kissing butt, the big day comes to hand out the contracts to private firms. Finally, they hire a few people and start the long process of building highways and bridges. I have personally witnessed 50 mile long stretches of highway take a decade or longer to build. It just doesn't make sense that this is going to help the economy in the immediate future. Even after the highway is built it's just a freakin' slab of conrete. It will take a few more years for businesses, new home construction, etc. to start up around the highway, which really causes the jobs and tax money to flow. We're talking looooong term investment here. Not something we'll see immediate dividens on. Am I wrong here? Can taking unemployed white collar workers and giving them a paint brush to paint a school or a shovel to work on a highway fix the economy in a year or two? Remember, we're talking about 4 million new jobs by 2010.

Take the future of fuel for example,   as a democrat I find the hunt for technologically advanced fuel alternatives exciting and challenging.        Talk to a Republican and all they can say is "Drill baby drill" and "Global warming ain't happening" They even find electing completely dumb Presidents "Cute"      Sort yourselves out Republicans,  the world is changing and you are not changing with it.

I was wondering whether anyone knows whether the Sinhalese were the first who lived in Sri Lanka or the Tamils. I know Signalise claim they've always lived there, but that is not the truth. According to my research Sinhalese came from Bengal whereas the Tamils came from Southern India. As to the epic story of Ramayana tamils lived in Sri Lanka many, many years before Sinhalese. What are your opinions?

I was told that when he gets caught this time that he will be a cillivan, so that means my daughter and grandson has no income or benifiates.

20090225124122AADuLDo	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do conservatives continue to support people like Palin and Jindal?	Bush gained the nomination because he claimed to be born-again....conservatives did not pay attention to his lack of intellect...they didn't care...he was "saved"!  Now look at the mess we are in by having had a president with lack of ideas, plans and intelligence.      Now you rally around Palin and this Jindal character.  It doesn't matter what they say or do....you still support them.  You seem again to be blinded by their professed conservative credentials.  Good grief....are you just looking for another Bush?        Why not nominate someone many American's can support?  Most Americans, like myself, are middle of the road...and would love a centrist candidate.  But, both parties keep producing extremes...what gives?

His record is clean with no page 11's and nothing below first class PFT in the past 7 years of his enlistment, as well as a Meritorious Mast.   While currently in Iraq, due to make Sargent, he was NJP'd,lost rank and was charged about $1000.  This is a problem because we were already taking a drop in income for his deployment.  We believe this punishment is too harsh.  He is having a hard time getting information over there due to their isolation.  Any information I could get about an appeal would be helpful.  Also, what are our chances of getting it overturned?
