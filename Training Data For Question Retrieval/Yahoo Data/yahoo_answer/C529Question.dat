20090223160322AAMWBwZ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Is it normal to hear/feel heartbeat in your head?	Before telling me to go to a doctor, this just now hit me as a problem.  I'm 6'4", 225 lbs.  Not too fat, don't eat unhealthy.  Most of my weight was from working out.        Sometimes, I can hear my heart in my head, throbbing for about 3 or 4 pulse beats.  Other times, I hear whooshing noises, where I hear a "whoosh whoosh whoosh" and get 'slightly' dizzy.        My blood pressure is almost always perfect.  When I listen to my heart in my head, I can actually slow it down by counting to 3 slowly in between beats, giving me a pulse rate of around 68.  Is it my heart?  Or do I have something wrong in my brain?

20090223162700AACvbWC	Health;Women's Health	Some help here please?	First of all I believe in saving sex until marriage and not living together until marriage.      I'm a Christian.      I have a rare disease that made me not reach puberty until age 23. So I have to take birth control pills prescribedby my doctor to maintain estrogen. I now have a normal sex drive and I am sexually attracted to men. I do get aroused and wet down there.      Here's the thing. Because of my medical problem I'm afraid I can't have sex physically because it'll be too painful.       When I was in college and haven't reached puberty yet I was sexually abused a lot because back then I was weak, passive, depressed and everything even saying no a million times made no difference. They still took advantage of me. Well when I was abused it hurt like heck! worst pain ever!       Don't worry I'm in counseling and since reaching puberty I'm strong and know how to set boundaries and if anyone crosses them I make sure they don't cross it again.       But if I can't have premarital sex to see if I can have sex how can I know that I can have sex? That a man's penis won't be so excruciating everytime it enters me?       I can easily insert things up there like tampons and medicine applicators.(after reaching puberty).      I'm 24 now.

20090223170156AAHT74p	Health;Mental Health	I'm scared, hurt, and lost....?	i'm in a depression. i have been for a year now. i've always heard the saying that 'give it time, time will heal things' but every day that passes things get worse. it's to the point now that i can't even open my eyes...litterally. i'll sit there in school in the chair with my knees pulled up to my chest tucked under my chin with my arms around my legs (holding myself together) with my eyes closed. i listen to the teachers lecture/give instructions with my eyes closed. when i'm on the phone with anyone/everyone my eyes are closed and i'm in that same position. i just can't stand seeing anymore. everything i see reminds my of my pain and when my eyes are open my eyes fill up with tears and i'm sick and tired of crying in front of everyone. i recently told my mom that i'm suicidal. she's my best friend and is here for me with everything no matter what. but things are continuosly getting worse. i'm afraid that i'm to the point where i'll kill myself without even thinking about it becuase i'll just be numb with pain. i can't hold myself up anymore, i don't know who to turn too because i'm done with the lectures. they make me feel better for all of 10 minutes tops. i'm already seeing a councilor (well my sessions are about to start soon) and i'm just soooo scared of hurting my mom with killing myself but i'm in soo much pain. it's not all mental i have a headache 24-7 because of all my mental pain. i'm strugalling with eating (have been for 10 months) and my body is slowly breaking down so my body aches, and i just hurt. i can't make that any more clear. I HURT SOOOO BAD!!!! and i'm so lost. i feel helpless...please, what do i do?       please.....: ' (

20090223170713AAwjboU	Health;Mental Health	Possible Tylenol PM addiction.?	I know, the commercial says that this is a good option for people who are not wanting to use prescription sleep aids, for fear of becoming dependent. That's not what this is about.    I'm a very true insomniac,  been diagnosed with depression, and bipolar, as well as anxiety, and I often get tension headaches, and migraines, and the lightest sleeper possible. Yes, I am a dangerous, and destructive package.    I used to use codeine, vicodin, lunesta, and any sort of alcohol to get me to relax and to sleep at night. I'm not interested in going down that road again, I have a child.    I don't have am unemployed, my husband supports us, as does Food Stamps. I don't have health insurance, I have applied, and been denied. I don't know when I'll have it again.      So, the point here is to say, I take tylenol PM every night, with or without pain, to fall asleep. I think it make be taking some kind of toll on my body. I am aware of the effects it will have on my liver.   Can anybody else relate? Even if you can't, but can provide advice enabling me with great ideas on how to realx at night, and fall asleep quickly, that would be welcome.   Thank you for your time.

I am still kinda freaked out though.   I did lose like 3 pounds the night before the urine test.   && they had a trace of protein in my urine.   I was just wondering if I will be fine?   I look the test on the 20th, (last friday)   exactly 70 days after I had smoked pot.         thanks.         p.s.   I know I smoked pot.   But this is really what I wanna do.   && I hardly smoked it before that.   I took two bong hits that day. December 15th.

20070207004636AA3SDta	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I feel sick after tanning..?	Today, me and my boyfriend went tanning at a tanning salon. It was his first time..but i've been going on and off for the last year. About 30 minutes - 1 hour after tanning, we both started feeling pretty bad. I thought we might be dehydrated..but we both drank alot when we got home and it didn't help. I feel very dizzy, weak and just sick. I don't seem to have a sun burn..my cheeks are a little red, but nothing different than usual. Has anyone ever had something similar happen? or know what this may be? I've looked on tons of sites and found no answers. The closest thing i found was people feeling sick for about 20 minutes after..but it's been about 5 hours, if not longer.       The only thing i found that seemed similar was sun poisoning..but I went in for 9 minutes on a machine with a 12 minutes maximum..and I've been going in for about 8 minutes normally and not feeling weird at all.      Any help would be appreciated.       Thanks!

20061107193139AAgRxWy	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I think I have claustrophobia?	It all started at a Cheap Sex concert. A ton of people in a tiny venue where the AC was broken and it was like 100 degrees, a lot of people were smoking, and I ended up on the bathroom floor thinking I was dying. Once you left you couldn't get back in, so I tried staying in the building for a while, but it was too much. The other kids I was with didn't want to leave until the show was over, so I ended up on the sidewalk outside shaking. The next night I went to the ER from an anxiety attack and stuff. There wasn't anything wrong medically, and we weren't drinking or anything. It was partially dehydration and just not eating enough too. (Whenever I think about that night I STILL feel nasty, blah.) Ever since that, I just feel really nervous about going to local concerts or parties.  It's like a burning sensation in my ears, then nausea, and then I'll start to feel really lightheaded and dizzy and then start shaking.. I hate it. Should I go to a psychologist/psychiatrist?

I just left my grandmother who is in a nursing home and is suffering from dementia.  My mom and I noticed that one of her thumbnails was completely off, except for part of it that was still there (on the very right side and this part looked healthy).  We thought this was weird.  We looked at her other nails and they looked like there was dirt under them and a few others were yellow and cracking.  We asked the nurse about it and she said that sometimes the nails get dry and fall off and that this is normal with age.  Now I want to know IF this is normal, or could we have a case of nursing home abuse here? I dont want to overlook this because there might be an abuse issue here.  I am concerned that her thumbnail was ripped off only because I saw part of the nail still there and that part was healthy.  Does anyone have any idea if its normal for you to lose your nails as you age and/or for them to turn yellow and thick? Thanks.

A veces le sangra la nariz, por ejemplo ayer estaba dormida y se va levantando a la 1:30 de la ma?ana llena de sangre, le sangrò la nariz y esto le ha pasado por varios a?os con frecuencia, por ahi dos veces al mes.      le dan todos los dias dolores de cabeza no muy muy fuertes ni suaves, mas o menos entre 11 del mediodia y 1 de la tarde, le duran 1 hora, ella estudia de 6:30am a 1:00.      maneja estres y preocupaciones, en la casa la tratan mal, se siente incomoda, en el colegio no se siente muy a gusto.      ella no practica algun deporte, solo lo del colegio.      cuando nada en piscinas le da dolor de cabeza.      duerme 6 horas diarias, pero a veces cuando la despiertan o se despierta no es capaz de conciliar el sue?o.      tambien le suelen dar mareos.

I used to work out all the time, and every once in a while my chest would feel really out of place and tight and I finally figured out a way to maneuver and get the joint around my sternum to crack and relieve the built up pressure. Unfortunately, I can't get it to work these days. I've tried a few techniques and it's not coming through. I'm very unflexible, especially in my shoulders because I've built a lot of muscle and it's very tight and knotty. Please list any techniques you have to get the sternum joint to crack/pop...I'm pretty sure there's no medical issue, but I would love to find a way to relieve this build up myself. No pain, just annoying when I reach my hands out in front of me or something. Thanks!

20090222151851AA6BpG1	Health;Mental Health	Do you believe that "people change"?	I don't. I believe that the core of someone's personality will ALWAYS remain the same no matter what. Some people might change certain BEHAVIORS...but their personality will always be the same. For example, I've met several born-again Christians who despite being born-again still have the same personality that they had before they became born-again (b*tchy, feisty, etc). Becoming religious did not change their personalities.      Also, someone who's blunt is not going to stop being blunt. They might choose to stay quiet at times to avoid getting into a confrontation (or even a fistfight). But they are not going to stop being a blunt person.

I stopped seeing him when i was 14 because he was drunk when me and my brother and sister went to see him.   At 16 i went to see him for a short while but he stopped coming to see me after his father died, because this was after my birthday he says i only wanted him for a present.   September last year i went to see him again because my brother had started to get a relationship with him, After my birthday he again left and i'm worried he will throw the same issue in my face again.   last time i saw him was 21st october.      I feel as though i have no life, i'm constantly trying to be somebody i'm not because i can't stand being me. I can't trust people and i am generally ashamed of my life. I can be seen as a bit of a 'mommy's boy' because i always stick with my mom and find it hard to break away.

20090222150613AAftnTu	Health;Women's Health	Suggestion for Deodorant?	I have a problem with my deodorant, I put on my clothes in the morning and then I put on my deodorant and it makes my arm pits wet. I am not sweaty or hot its just that the deodorant doesn't dry.Like yesterday I went out with some friends and I wore a gray shirt and I wasn't hot or sweaty at all and it made my shirt wet and it showed a lot! It made me mad. I have tried Dove, Secret, and Lady Speed Sick solids and none of them work. I don't know about trying roll on because I have a feeling it will just make my arm pitts more wet. So does anyone know of a brand and type of deodorant that doesn't cause wetness, and prevents smell? I need a deodorant that does what its supposed to!         Thank you!

I got knocked off by a metal bar and landed directly on my lower back on the gravel, hard. Since then, I've had back problems. My back will go into spasm for no apparent reason, to the point where my posture is affected and it's difficult to sit down. There's good and bad days but there's always an underlying stiffness and soreness, rubbing the muscles is always painful. If I work the muscles at all, then my back definately gets stressed out and I pay for it.      I went to the doctor, and he said since I was only sixteen years old, xrays are too risky because I might want kids someday. He gave me robaxicet, which does a decent job of relaxing my back for a bit-- but it's stiff again as soon as the medicine wears off, and within a few days, it's back into spasm. I don't want to keep covering up the problem.. I need advice as to what to do.

I'd never felt anything like it before, and so I researched a bit online just now and found these symptoms to be related to heart attacks. However, its been over 12 hours since i last felt these pains. All the websites i've been on says call 911, but I feel fine right now. Does anybody know the time periods in between heart attacks, and if this is a one time thing, such as just a fluke?(I'm only 18 and i don't believe i've done much to warrant a heart attack)

My problem is that I always seem to get sick every other week or so (cold/cough/fever symptoms). I have missed way too many days at school this year, and have been struggling to keep up with my classes feeling the way i always do. My mother says that I just have a bad immune system and I don't help it by staying up late nights on the weekend. The only unhealthy things that I can think of that I do are staying up till about 3-4 on some weekends playing xbox 360 with friends that come over, my friends all do the same and some even worse than me that get about 3-5 hours of sleep any night, yet they never get sick. from Monday to Friday, I get usually 7 hours of sleep, just Friday and Saturday nights that I stay up late ( I get more sleep though from sleeping in than I do weekdays). So basically my question is: should I take some sort of vitamin tablets or something to improve my health, what can I do to keep from being ill all of the time?

So we did, she tried one time and of course he started crying and she told me she could not do it and told us to take him to ER.

20090222120458AAbqHjA	Health;Mental Health	Is this postpartum depression?	I am 26 years old and delivered my first baby, a boy almost 2 weeks ago via c-section. He was born with an infection so he had to stay in the NICU for 7 days on antibiotics. On the day he was supposed to come home he started having dips in his respiration so they said he couldn't come home for a few more days and was put on oxygen. A few days passed and they had to up his oxygen and so we were told to wait a few more days.. well to make a long story short he is still there. Everytime I look at him I cry.. when I am home I cry because I am so terrified. I am scared because I love him so much and it hurts so intensely to have him there. I always cry when I think about him, and when I see his little clothes. I cry when he looks into my eyes because I love him so much that it literally hurts me inside.      I guess I just want to hear that I am not losing my mind. We are praying that he can come home this week. I think having him at home with me will help so much.      Can anyone relate to me, because if I do have postpartum depression I just want it to go away. I have lost so much weight because I can't eat. I cry a lot too. I have never had one thought about hurting myself or the baby, I only feel sad a lot. I also worry about my baby excessively.      Also any resources or hotlines would help.

Okay, so I was just wondering if anyone thinks it's weird that pretty much everyday I log onto www.eplans.com (a site that has a bunch of different house plans) and I look for houses. Not for me necessarily. Just for fun. Like I imagine that I live there, or that it's where I'll be when I grow up, and then I think of what I would do to the inside of the house. Is that normal? Should I stop? It's not like I'm a loner or anything either because I do hang out with my friends on a regular basis, I'm on JV track and I have a gpa of 4.0, and I'm a freshman in highschool. Is it weird that I am basically obsessed with house layouts? And tell me the honest truth. Don't try to not hurt my feelings. I just really want to know.

My husband has used meth off and on for 4-5 years but used regularly for the past 6mo - 1 yr..  I did not know he was using until recently.  Due to his abusive behavior, his anger issues and the fact that I found out he was using I moved back to my parents with our six month old son.  I am 32 we have been together 7 yrs.  He entered himself into an outpatient treatment program through our hospital and has been clean about 40 days.  I am getting therapy and attending codependency anonymous meetings.  He wants me and our son to move back home.  He says I can drug test him every day.  How does one know when it is right to live together again ?  I think it is too early but he is desperate to be with his son and says it will help him to have his wife with him while he recovers.  What do married couples normally do in this type of situation ?

20090222152912AA7Z0Sa	Health;Dental	What dental product 2 use 2 change the shape of my top lip which subsiquently changes the shape of my nostrils?	Now this is a random question, but would really appreciate the advice if poss, here goes..      Basically, i want to change the shape of my top lip so that my nose appears rounder. I don't want a nose job but have noticed when i put cotton will under my top lip between my lip and gum it makes me look like i have a bit of a fat lip, but i can deal with that. But it subsequently changes my nostrils from being horribly narrow and pointy which im paranoid about, to instead a nicer rounder pair of nostrils which gives my face a better younger appearance. It changes the shape as when there is something between the lip and gum it protrudes the top lip out as if im pouting and changes the shape of the nose nostrils. Told u it was a weird one, but its a serious thing for me and i do not want to risk surgery.      So to the point anyway lol.. i wondered if anyone new of any dental product i could use up there.. maybe a gum shield or some mould-able gum that lasts a while and doesn't move around up there. I don't want it coming down to my teeth line where people can notice it but i don't mind looking as if i have been punched =P ..and obviously it would be nice if it was safe and didn't irritate. Hoping there is some dental answer as cotton wool is starting to get bad and people can notice it also, as it moves down and i keep having to re-apply and i can't eat easily with it in.      What about botox too to change the shape of the bit above my top lip and below my nose (philtrum) i am to believe is what it is called. That is the bit that changes the nostril shape when protruded out.      Thanks ever so much for reading.      Regards   Michael

I used to not really worry about it because I was a virgin so I missing my periods just didn't really matter to me but now I am having sex. I have had sex 6 times now and they have all been within the month of February.       Sitting and thinking for a while about the situation Don't know what to do. Since I have always had irregular periods how will I ever know if I get pregnant. I've also never been to the Gyno. so I don't really know what I would say to them if I did go. I could be pregnant at the very moment and just not know it.. My biggest worry is going to see a doctor and then them saying when was your last period and I have no idea when it was, and then since I have recently been sexually active then the doctor not knowing how diagnose my problem.

20090222112136AAJ8pqD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Is it colon cancer or just a lack of fiber in my diet?	Hello,      A little over two weeks ago, I experienced really weird and very painful pain in my upper abdomen. It felt like a wave of pain was going from one side to the other. I never had that before, so I ended up spending a day at the hospital. They made me do blood tests, since they suspected I might have had a case of appendicitis. I also did a few chest x-rays, I believe in order to check if there was any obstruction in my intestine, because they also suspected constipation. None of them turned out positive for any of those signs. The general surgeon could not understand what it was. Whenever he pressed on at the top in between my lower ribs, I would be in a lot of pain. In the end, he told me that I might just have constipation, and to just improve my diet with lots of fiber and liquids.       I began doing so, but then whenever I go to the washroom now, I have rectal bleeding with pain. I find it on the toilet paper and in the bowl as well. I've been doing some readings, and what I've found was that I might have a case of hemorrhoids, which would explain the bleeding. I've been trying to keep up a high fiber diet, although I must admit I might not be taking the 35g recommendation. I will start taking Metamucil, so hopefully that'll help a bit.      Looking back at what I had, I'm really worried that I might have a type of colon cancer. Is it possible with the symptoms I had/have? Has anyone else experienced this and found any answers?       I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could help,       Thank you

Guess I have no choice, this is what the surgeon wants to do since they are impacted and I know I would rather be asleep, just the thought scares me. I am more than willing to do what my oral surgeon recommends. Anyway, how often do people have severe complications afterward? Such as infections, death, etc. Thanks! :)

20090222142010AAnE9cI	Health;Mental Health	My life is sucky these days?	I know that I am not suffering the most in the world right now, but I kinda hate my life right now. Not in a depressed-pshyco-I'm gonna turn out to be a murderer way...but It just sucks      I'm a junior now, and I hate it. My grades are slipping because every one of my teachers think that I only have one class...the one that they teach...so they cram so much homework that it destorys the little social life I have. My brother had the same teachers that I have this year, and he said they were awesome and did'nt do anything in their classes work related...but now every teacher gives me a big pile of work every day. It's like "Well Good Morning...here's an assload of work" And Tuesday...work...and Wednesday...Work...and Thur...   While my brother does nothing in his classes this year...or last year. He had Beach Day in his Calc class Friday...guess what I did in my math class friday...you guessed it...WORK      I'm a smart kid, but I go to a really smart school. A school where kids think they are failing in a class, when they really have an 86 in the class. In every class, it's like I'm in a room full of super-brained kids...relaxed over-achievers, and it feels like I'm the only one who has to bput effort in the work i have to do...it's like they enjoy work...like their friggin' robots. THere was this" rave" on FRiday...not a drug rave, but an organized social gathering by a city youth group. Oh wow...I never knew raves were organized and advertised where police could find out. " Hey Jack( that's not my name, by the way, just an example), are you going to the rave...hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaa" " Are you going to the rave...rave rave rave rave rave" NO, I CAN'T GO... I'm to busy not going to the friggin rave      Don't get me wrong, I'm an honor roll student...but so is about 60% of the school..and the other 40% are about 2 points away from getting onto it. I'm in the Academic team( as if you didn't think I was a nerd already) because my parents force me. I'm not good at it because all the questions are about operas and European fine literatute...not math or history. My parents don't allow me to do sports, and my mom has to dress me every day( not clothes or stuff, but she HAS to put cover-up, lip cream, and he has to comb my hair so I look like a F*G). She DECIDED my classes for next year. "Okay, you're going to take Calc CP(even though I could take AB, she's scared of math), you're going to take Anatomy..." It just feels like she won't let me do anything except go on the play games in my room listening to Metallica. And whenever I try to do something that she doesn't like...she just says" Hormones, hormones", and walks away because she doesn't wanna hear it      I don't really have a social life. All my friends are seniors, and I have no underclassmen friends. I don't know what I'm going to do when they leave for college. Plus, they're all very annoying too. If I hear another story about the differences between a Corvette and a Land Crusier...I swer to God...         I work at Ace Hardware, and I'm horrible at it, and I hate the people at my shifts. I want to work with my brother on his shifts, but my boss says were understaffed on cashiers on my shifts...WE have 5 cashiers and we only need 2 on my shift. By the way, their are only 4 registers. 5-4 equals that I could friggin move to the sunday shift   My grades are slipping to B's...still pretty good grades, but my Honors teachers says that I should drop to CP courses,    WTF. It's like if I miss one question on a test I can't be good at school. It's...unexplainable. I'm sick of this high school bullshmit   Well, that's pretty much my life this semester. I know I'm not a refugee in Iraq, or m family didn't die of malaria in Sudan...but I always feel that I can't feel bad about my life because some African boy has it worse.    I'm also kinda worried that one of my teachers is reading this and will answer..."THis is Mr. X, I'll see you on Monday with extra homework"    Whenever my mind tries to make me feel better, it always has to come up with another point to make me fell horrible...an undebatable point...   ...I just don't know anymore...4 more months of school...without any days off because we missed 2 days in SEptembber due to constructuion. 56 million in taxpayers money...

Do all orthodontists offer pretty designs?       Also, they said they might leave the back braces on! What does that mean? Why would they do this?      ALSO, I have metal rings on my back teeth. Are they going to take those off as well?      THANKS FOR ANSWERING. I'm sorry I asked so much, but I'm nervous.

And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

However I feel extremely negative towards about all aspects of my life and myself and my mother seems to be showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

20090222141628AAJZOoF	Health;Mental Health	What do you think about this?	Me and my boyfriend have been dating a year and two months. He suffers from winter depression and i'm trying to help him through it.       I still get confuse whether it's his depression or if he's cheating.  I have been wrong all the other times.       this winter he's telling me he's working late hours. i can't reach him on the weekends. I went to his house last weekend and he wasn't home or didn't answer his door.       Are their any other signs you can tell apart from him cheating or being depressed.       I really love him and just want to help him.   Thanks!

20090222140556AAwLome	Health;Other - Health	Did i have a panic attack or was it an allergic reaction?	After taking flagyl(Metronidazole) for 4 days i had an allergic reaction to the pill.My allergic reactions were numbness,abdominal pain,dizziness,tingling,mild muscle spasms,small rash,shortness of breath, and I could also taste and smell the pill.While having the allergic reaction i decided just to drink lots of water and i tried to remain calm and to go sleep which i did.       That morning i went to the doctor and I felt like they did not help much they only gave me a prescription for a UTI and went back home.      While i was at home i still felt the shortness of breath and minimal itching and numbness , however what kept bothering me was that i had the muscle spams and it started to really concern me that i felt like i had to go to the ER(which i did) because i thought i was going to have a seizure the only thing the doctor prescribed me was Xanax which i am not taking(i don't want to become dependent on xanax)      Its been 3 days since the allergic reaction and the itching is gone i just have the numbness,sinus pressure, and the muscle spams is this just part of the anxiety/panic attack (I can try to control this)or should I make and appointment with a doctor?       Thanks for reading and answering! :D

My question is why don't the medical administration and community offer these kind of alternatives instead of medication that treats only the symptoms and not the causes and have so many side affects that it's not even worth taking the medication? Why go through months and even years of grueling kimo therapy when something can be done without causing undo harm to the patient?

Im starting to believe my boyfriend is gonna be abusive at a point in our relationship but maybe im ..overreacting.      Ill tell u a little about him   He is a VERY emotional person and gets extremly down wen he's dissapointed. He has threated to kill himself wen i brokeup with him in the past (for cheating on me and lying about alotttt) ..we worked it out tho obviously   .......he cries a lot. he also is more jealous then he was in the begining of the relationship and he took out on me by cursing at me lst night...and cursing out my ex boyfriend to me. I noticed his behavior has changed since we were first together... i mean not drastically but he does sumtimes question me more about where iam and who im with..he's done it twice or 3 times. ...in the past week. Last night i got him mad coz i told him something that hurt him and on the other end of the phone all i heard was a loud *** sound and he told me he broke the stool because he got mad and punched it. Sometimes he gets mad and starts bugging out but he always says sorry for it. And he is soo remorseful.      The last time i went to leave him after having an argument and breaking up with him...he hugged me and i went to let g to go home.... and he held me back with a little force...and he didn't let me go to leave...and i told him i didn't like it...and he said he wasn't trying to be abusive but he said heheld me a little because it was hard to let me go         He assures**** me he would hit himself before he ever touched me...he assures me he will never ever hit me ever.          Do u think these are early warning signs..and that he may hit me in the future..or is he really just upset but hell never take it out on me...from personal expierience can anyone tell me wat other signs there are that the guy may become physical ?

Last Tuesday I played in an intramural basketball game and I fell on my back after getting my legs taken from under me while attempting a layup. I got up quickly without feeling any pain at all but two days later on Thursday I started feeling pain in my lungs, and it hurt when I breathed hard or just moved fast.      On Saturday I realized its not my lung, but my heart that hurts when I breathed hard, and sneeze and cough.      What could be wrong? It feels better now but I'm wondering if there is more to it than some type of bruising. Also the left side of my back also hurt, the bone but that's gone now.

20090222142935AAi84W9	Health;Men's Health	Circumcision: Have you had your sons circumcised or will you have your sons circumcised?	There is a growing controversy over circumcision and for a good reason.        Parents are not told of the all the possible complications Please go to  http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...  to see a list of the complications, look at the pictures, the worst of them is loss of the glans and loss of the entire penis but there are many who are left with terribly disfigured penises.        As someone with a penis you know how important a penis is to your identity as a man and I ask you how you could take a chance of ruining your son's penis for life.      If you still want to have it done to your son, please watch a video of it being done before you make your final decision. There are several available on youtube, just type in circumcision in the search section. It is very graphic but watch it all.      It has been proven by ALL major health organizations that there are no significant health benefits in favor of circumcision and none of them recommend routine circumcision.  The only reason circumcision became so popular in the USA is because parents were told that it would cut down on masturbation because it would leave the penis desensitized for life. This was in a time when doctors thought that masturbation caused a wide range of medical problems.      The main reason that doctors give for having the circumcision today is that it lowers the risk of urinary tract infections, but what they don't tell you is that there are no serious health risks from urinary tract infections, that they are easily treated and that there is a higher risk of infection from the circumcision itself.       It is your responsiblity as a parent to keep your child from harm, make an informed decision.
20090222142414AAXN4ZR	Health;Women's Health	WHY DOES MY GRANDMOTHER HATE ME SO MUCH????????????????????	This is long, but i really need advice:      I am a 16 year old girl, and ever sense i can remember, my grandmother has hated me. When i was 2-3 years old my grandfather would molest me in her presence, and she would pretend that nothing was going on, when she knew what was happening. When my older sister told my mom what was going on, my grandmother denied it, and said that we were terrible kids for making something like that up. My whole life she would ignore me. When i was 15 i had to live with her for a summer, and she treated me horrible. She told me that my mother does not love me, and tried to convince me that my mom was having an affair with random men when that was not even true. She blamed me for the reason my parents broke up, saying that my dad had a right to cheat on my mom, and because i accidentally found his match.com account, it was my fault because i was "snooping" ( I really was trying to go on myspace.com, but match.com came up first because it was on out computers history, so i showed my mom) Once i went home after that summer she lied about me to my whole family, saying that i pushed her, stole money from her, and told her that "her husband never loved her" NONE OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED. It makes me furious, because i have not way to defend myself, because everyone believes her. I do not know why my grandmother hates me so much, and wants to hurt me. She told me once "I would rather be with any of my grandchildren but YOU" It really hurt.   Why does she hate me?

20090222142322AA95Jst	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	How effective is laser dermatology on acne and acne scar removal for the body?	I am 21 years old and am plagued by body acne (mostly scars, but still some bumps) on my chest, all over my back, and I think it is starting to move lower, since I found a couple of bumps on my buttocks area and leg. I used to have mountains of big red bumps on my face, but those have subsided a few years ago and left only light scaring on the cheeks and neck.While my face looks much better than it did throughout high school, my body acne has prevented from taking my shirt off in public for the past 4 or 5 years.   I've tried everything, including accutane, which very mildly reduced the bumps, but after 5 months gave me no noticeable improvements.   I am about 6'3" 180 lbs, male, and I eat healthily. I live in Los Angeles and have heard many commercials about LDI (Laser Dermatology Institute) which claims to remove acne scars. I was wondering if anyone has received this treatment on severe acne or if anyone knows how effective it is, how long it takes to work, if results last, etc.
