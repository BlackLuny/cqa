Un ejemplo es el Miss Universo, (en la que Republica Dominicana, la representante de mi pais quedo entre las finalistas), todos nosotros felicitamos a nuestros amigos venezolanos y colombianos, y ustedes lo unico que hacian era criticar, y lo peor decir que la nariz de Bruja que los represento era mas bonita.   Un poco de Humildad.      Esa es mi opinion, soy de mente abierta si hay una mejor opinion, bienvenida.

20090223111534AAakPsW	Politics & Government;Politics	Wall Street adjustment and dangers from media question?	Initial quote paraphrased from American NPR      "When people believe the economy is a flawless system, and that everything is going, or at least better than it actually is (as both Bush's, Clinton, and Regan lead the American populace to believe) well we don't award stock prices to companies for what they're worth, but for what we think they're worth"      Obama's being truthful about the economy, and the Stock market is adjusting to the actual worth of the companies (similar to when the internet bubble burst);      Unfortunately the press is spinning the above in a way that might cause an actual stock crash, as we might stop viewing the market as it actually is and start viewing it as we think it is, this time viewing the values of companies as less than they actually are, thus causing the stock prices to reflect this belief.      Who agrees, disagrees, please try to logically support your arguments, and if possible use links to support these arguments.

20090223110337AAzKLkc	Politics & Government;Politics	Is America living in a financial fiction?	Lincoln established the idea of "the Union" (aka Federal Govt overriding state govt.) which effectively overrides the 10th amendment.      This allowed for the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 ("federal" like Federal Express) which issues paper money.      FDR confiscated all the gold bullion in 1933 via Executive Order 6102 and gave the people paper in exchange. (Shortly after this forced sale, the price of gold from the treasury for international transactions was raised to $35 an ounce; the U.S. government thereby devalued the U.S. dollar by 41%.)      Nixon abandoned the gold standard completely. (Resulted in more inflation and a dollar with even less purchasing power)      Now the whole paper financial fiction is about to collapse and people will have nothing.      ........As an interesting side note, if the govt. nationalizes the banks and then the dollar collapses, then the GOVT. could start seizing assets because THEY WOULD OWN THE BANKS. (dollar bills certainly won't cover any debt in 8 months)      Andrew Jackson (who hated Central Banks and paper money) actually managed to get the national debt down to about $30,000 at one point. The banking cartel (Federal Reserve), once established, thought it funny to then put his face on the most popular piece of paper money in history: the twenty dollar bill.

Why so hard to help?	those who sacrifice so much, including their lives?   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   AP IMPACT: Army charity hoards millions      FORT BLISS, Texas – As soldiers stream home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the biggest charity inside the U.S. military has been stockpiling tens of millions of dollars meant to help put returning fighters back on their feet, an Associated Press investigation shows.      Between 2003 and 2007 — as many military families dealt with long war deployments and increased numbers of home foreclosures — Army Emergency Relief grew into a $345 million behemoth. During those years, the charity packed away $117 million into its own reserves while spending just $64 million on direct aid, according to an AP analysis of its tax records.      Tax-exempt and legally separate from the military, AER projects a facade of independence but really operates under close Army control. The massive nonprofit — funded predominantly by troops — allows superiors to squeeze soldiers for contributions; forces struggling soldiers to repay loans — sometimes delaying transfers and promotions; and too often violates its own rules by rewarding donors, such as giving free passes from physical training, the AP found.      AER was founded in 1942 to soften the personal financial hardships on soldiers and their families as the country ramped up its fight in World War II.      Today, AER's mission is to ease cash emergencies of active-duty soldiers and retirees, and to provide college scholarships for their families. Its emergency aid covers mortgage payments and food, car repairs, medical bills, travel to family funerals, and the like.      Instead of giving money away, though, the Army charity lent out 91 percent of its emergency aid during the period 2003-2007. For accounting purposes, the loans, dispensed interest-free, are counted as expenses only when they are not paid back.      During that same five-year period, the smaller Navy and Air Force charities both put far more of their own resources into aid than reserves. The Air Force charity kept $24 million in reserves while dispensing $56 million in total aid, which includes grants, scholarships and loans not repaid. The Navy charity put $32 million into reserves and gave out $49 million in total aid.      AER executives defend their operation, insisting they need to keep sizable reserves to be ready for future catastrophes.civilian charities for service members and veterans say they are swamped by the desperate needs of recent years, with requests far outstripping ability to respond.      According to 2007 U.S. Census Bureau figures, 1.3 million veterans — or 6 percent — lived in poverty, with 537,000 unemployed.      "I have so many people who are losing their homes, they're behind on their mortgage payments, they're losing their jobs because of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) or the medication they're taking — and the Army Emergency Relief can't help them," says Outreach Director Sema Olson at U.S. Welcome Home Foundation, which finds aid for combat veterans.

Conservatives and Liberals throw the word 'socialism' around like they have some kind of Aristotilean understanding of it. Conservatives are gawking about how Obama is a socialist and is imposing socialism on our country. Liberals in some corners are saying the same things.       My question is, do any of you actually know what socialism is without having to go look up a definition of it? Do you have an honest understanding of the concept that you speak so frequently about?       Most people just analogize socialism to Soviet "Communism" and assume it is very bad. Most people think socialism and communism are political/forms of government instead of understanding what they actually are. I am looking for an obviously unreferenced answer to my question. Show me how socialism is what America is heading towards. Tell me how socialism is even possible in this system. Don't answer me like I don't know what it is, because I believe I have an operational understanding of it. I'm more interested if those that use this word over and over again have any idea what it is. Intelligible answers only please. Thanks.

For the first time in the US history, we are rewarding laziness and heralding a lack of education and self worth and self reliance. Over 40 % of the US population has a zero tax liability.

But, how have we become a welfare state where generations of people get government assisted housing, food, medical care and even cash? Why do hard working and responsible people have to pay for the lazy to never even try to support themselves?      I also feel that if you are on any form of public assistance, you should not be allowed; heck it should be illegal for one to purchase or possess alcohol, cigarettes or lottery tickets. Why should my tax dollars pay your rent, buy your groceries and provide you with other goods and services for free while in turn you use your money for vices?

From the guest list, it sure looks like the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) was on the White House front burner.         GUEST LIST::   Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters; Mark Ayers, head of the Building and Construction Trades Department of AFL-CIO; Jerry McEntee of AFSCME;  Randi Weingarten of AFT;  Dennis Van Roekel of NEA;  Carl Pope of Sierra Club;  Andre Delattre of PIRGs;  Janice McGee;  Cecile Richardson of Planned Parenthood;  Kathryn Kolbert of People For the American Way;  Joe Solomonese of Human Rights Campaign;  Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; Jerry Hudson of SEIU; Andy Stern of SEIU; Eli Pariser and Justin Ruben of MoveOn.org.

Congrats to both!); Van Jones; Tom Donahue of the US Chamber of Commerce; Harry Alford of the National Black Chamber of Commerce; John Castellani of the Business Roundtable      Obama and his wife Michelle appealed to these leaders and signaled that their groups would play a key role in driving the big progressive changes at the heart of the White House’s legislative agenda, an attendee tells me.   The message was that these groups would be valuable as a kind of progressive outside “echo chamber,” as the attendee puts it.   The party — which was organized by top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett — signals that the White House is moving forward with efforts to build coordination with outside progressive groups in order to drive the White House’s message and beat back its foes. .

20090223100924AAFB7Y1	Politics & Government;Elections	Would you hire Bristol Palin to speak out against teen pregnancy?	ABC's Teddy Davis and Sara Just report: Bristol Palin, the 18-year-old daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, told Fox News in her first interiew since giving birth that she would like to be an advocate against teen pregnancy.      "Everyone should wait 10 years," Palin said. "I hope people learn from my story."      "It's so much easier if you're married, have a house and career. It's not a situation you want to strive for."      The announcement of Bristol Palin's pregnancy made headlines last summer just days after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., selected her mother as his running mate for the Republican presidential ticket. Bristol Palin gave birth to a son, Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston, on Dec. 28, 2008.      Bristol Palin knocked down speculation that her mother's political views played a role in her decision about how to handle the unexpected pregnancy. "It was my choice to have the baby," the 18 year old said. "It doesn't matter what my mom's views are on it. It was my decision."      Bristol Palin described to Fox's Greta Van Susteren the moment when she, her boyfriend, Levi Johnston, and another friend told her parents that she was pregnant. She described that moment as "harder than labor."

It could scare away a theif and / or drawl the nieghbours attention. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with bike alarms? Do they really work? I read that a theif could smother the sound with a towl but since most theifs have never come across a bike alarm, most of them probally won't know that it has an alarm on it if I remove the sticker that says alarm on it.

20090223144301AAZ1xu2	Politics & Government;Military	What should I do...join now? or wait?	Okay so here's the back ground. My bf is joining the AF and I'm getting married and going with him after basic and tech and all of that. Unfortunately he has his GED and the spots are filled until next year so he has to wait until then to join.       I really wanted to join the AF, mostly as a nurse since that is what my career goal is at the moment. I spoke to a recruiter and unfortunately for me, I have to have my BSN in order to be a nurse in the AF. And I was told by that recruiter that they DO NOT offer any financial assistance for getting your BSN, it is only further education where they provide assistance.       I will not being applying for nursing school until my boyfriend goes into the AF so that I can go with him and then attend nursing school from wherever we are stationed.      The problem is, is that is a ways away and I still want to join the AF. I'm comtemplating whether I should join anyways and do nursing school after I serve for 4 years, or whether I should wait until after nursing school and then join as a nurse and an officer.       I've also contemplated the reserves, but I called them today and was told that if I join the reserves, at this time I would not be able to become Active duty since they are not taking anyone with prior service. I don't think the reserves are for me.       Anyways I was just wondering what you all think I should do. Thanks in advance for your advice!!

I know I have to go through boot camp so I don't think she can be with me after that. But what happens after I get through boot camp.      I'm also planning to adopt my nephew and two nieces if I get into the army. That is because my sis and her husban are having a tough situation which I don't even want to get into details. I really love this kids and will give my life to see them having a quality life full with everything that the parents can't afford for them. So I want to take care of them is not like I want to take them away from their father and mother because I have a very good relationship with them. So I just want to know if I adopt them, if is possible what benefits will they and I be getting as my dependents?      I know is a lot of stuff but I don't want to make this decision without having all my facts in my side. I also want to know what benefits I'll be getting when I get through boot camp and if there is a chance I can take my family to where I get assigned. I don't know if this is possible I really have no idea, I know that I can be with my wife, but what about the babies, my mom and my sister?      I know guys is a lot of stuff but try to help me guys wheter you know from facts, you are in the military or have been there. I know I should tell you that my strongest option is the army but I'm open to any info u guys have on the other branches.    Maybe it works a little bit different with the other one in respect to family, benefits, duties, time in war, etc etc.      Thank you guys for every answer I get. This is very important and I appreciate every minute u take to give me an answer take care guys and God bless you.

Now im confused becuase i see some people say they got 88's and such and claim thats a great score.... But at the same time i had an overage percentage of 68% which is pathetic in grading terms...

Wouldn't it be funny if our president attended the next meeting of the big whigs with gansta chains, big gansta shades, a long white muscle shirt, gansta pants down to his knees, dreadlocks, tatooed biceps, and two big earings, all while blasting cheap gansta rap on his music player?

20090223154648AAd4QB5	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Are schools legally allowed to do this?	I had to go pick up my cousin's from school today because all three of them got detention.       The reason? They refused to participate in what the school called "celebrate the nation's savior: Obama" day. The students were expected to make a report and give a speech on why Obama will "save" this country.      Now, my family didn't vote for Obama, no one in my family supported Obama, it wasn't for racist reasons, it was more of the fact that most of his supporters were unreasonable idiots who though if you didn't vote Obama you were racist.      Now, my cousins didn't participate, they refused to write the report and give a speech, when I went to pick them up the principle told me that because of their refusal that they'd fail this semester.      Now, you are probably wondering why I am asking this, its because I have custody of my cousins while My Aunt is in Detox and my Uncle is in Jail.      So can a school legally fail a student for refused to do something that shouldn't have been mandatory?

20090223153611AAaVR62	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do misdemeanor criminal  records show up in a different  state than the original crime  was committed in?	I was charged with misdemeanor shoplifting, and it was dismissed, but still shows on my record, and I plead guilty to misdemeanor loitering, because I thought it would be no big deal, and my summer job wouldn't hire with a pending case.      I have became familiar with expungement procedures and all that is preventing me from doing it is the money to pay the lawyer.       I know most think that only felonies prevent you from getting a job, but I am proof that after nearly 7 months of job searching misdemeanor records play a part too! beyond these two offenses i have no other criminal history.       So, with all this said, if I apply for employment in a different state will these two things show up on my background check?
20090223153913AASNslT	Politics & Government;Military	Worried about Army enlistment?	This march I'm on enlisting in the Army Reserves as a split-op.   I'm a junior in high school. Thing I'm worried about is that I smoked weed about 3-4 months ago. I smoked like twice in the same week. And I'm pretty positive I will be fine and pass the drug test, I'm just worried about it. I don't look back at smoking weed once in a blue moon as a problem because It never became a problem to me. I decided I wanted to do the Army Reserves, stopped smoking easily and since I quit people offered me weed numerous times and I've denied them because I know I have better things to do. What should I say if the recruiter asks me if I smoked before? I was thinking of just saying that I smoked like a half a year ago and didn't like it. I'm not planning on smoking weed  ever again so staying in the Army won't be a problem. Also If someone walks past you smoking a joint/blunt and you are able to smell it in the air for like 2 seconds that won't show up on a test would it? Thanks guys.
