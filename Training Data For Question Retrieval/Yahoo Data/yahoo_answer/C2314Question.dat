20090219230042AAqHGku	Education & Reference;Quotations	Love quote - for rendezvous note!!?	So.. my boyfriend and I have a little history at a hotel (nothing scandalous at all) - but I thought I would have a little surprise for him there. I would rent a room, he wouldn't know ahead of time, I'd have his cousin drive him there so he doesn't have a clue, with only a note stating the floor and the room number.. and of course a love quote!      This isn't anything huge, we've been dating 4 years, it's not a big anniversairy date or anthing, but he's my love and I love em'! And hotels are fun; plus the place I'm planning to stay at is baaaaalling - plasma TV, steam shower.. haha.      so    quotes anybody?      I've always like    "To love is to admire with the heart, so admire is to love with the mind"  - not exploding with cheesiness you know?  Not sure if it's appropriate though.      Thanks guys,

20090219234441AAPd4gf	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Question about dependency, and current address?	I just moved out of the house to live with my brother. I' am 20 his 28, I help him pay rent, bills and other expenses. I' am trying to get financial aid, so I can go to school, so I' am filling out fafsa and after going though it determined that I was independent, so there for I did not have to fill out my parents info. The thing is, although my current address is with my brother, my license and my vehicle is still registered to my parents address, I go to their house about 2 to 3times a week to visit and help around, and pick up any mail I have received. Will this be a problem, with the whole address thing?
20090219233414AApbFxY	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	FAFSA question about dependency?	On one of the questions on fafsa which determines whether your dependent or not reads as follows.       (((Do you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you, now and through June 30, 2010 (question 54)?)))      Again, the FAFSA is asking about "support" that includes money, gifts, loans, housing, food, clothes, car payments or expenses, medical and dental care, and payment of school costs. In this question, the people supported must live with you throughout the award year.      In my situation, I' am currently 19 years old, and I live out of the house with my older brother. I help him pay rent, food, bills, and other expenses. So for that question would that be a "yes" since I do have someone other than myself who depends on my financial help?
20090219233955AAiCrID	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone edit my paragraph please?	The book Among the Hidden reminds me of other books that I have read before and something similar. This book is really parallel to The Diary of Anne Frank. Also, the setting of the house reminds me of Charlotte’s Web. The Diary of Anne Frank was about a teenage Jewish girl, who hid from the Nazis during the occupation of Holland. This is similar to Among the Hidden because Luke was hiding from the population police and Anne was hiding from the Nazis. In addition, the hogs that Luke’s family had raised remind me of Charlotte’s Web because the surroundings were mostly plains, trees, and farms, and the plot was based on the pig which was saved by the eight year old girl from getting killed because it was a runt. Both the books Anne Frank and Among the Hidden is about a pre-teen hiding, and gets one thrilled of what would happen to the next chapter.
20090219234608AAycpTP	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone please edit my short paragraph?	Towards the beginning of the novel, I found it boring and dull. However, starting from the middle, the climax of the book, I began to enjoy it. I enjoyed the book where he starts to meet Jen and his chance of sneaking to her house. Also the chapters are really short, so that it will make you continue to read for more. I do not have a lot of connections for Among the Hidden. Probably it is more of a science fiction book. As a result, my connections for this novel lets me recall the my past life, compare the book to other books, and learn from the reality.
20090219232317AA9nWTt	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	? When is the time to apply for college/university???	I know that it's almost the weekend and nobody probably wants to answer a question about school, haha, but I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to help me out. :D I did ask this once already, but I forgot some important details and the answers weren't quite what I was looking for, so I hope you don't mind me asking a second time.   Okay, so next year I am hoping to take grades 11 and 12 (parents making me be home-schooled so I figured what the heck) and then go to college or university right away the following year. But, i don't know exactly when I would be supposed to apply, because I heard it's best to apply near Christmas to get a spot, but I will technically still be in the 11th grade! If I wait until April when I am well into 12th grade, then would it be too late? And would my chances decrease of getting into the school for applying late? I heard that you can start college/university in January, would that probably be better?   Also, if I did the whole two grades in one year thing, and went to college or university the next year, I would only be 15. Would schools be less likely to accept me because of my age, even if my grades are good?   The school system I am doing isn't exactly homeschooling, it's more like a distance schooling. It's recognized by the government and people who have graduated from it have been excepted into Harvard and Princeton so that's not a problem. You get to work at your own pace, and this year I finished my grade very early, to be honest I think it would be possible to do 3 grades in one year! So that's not a problem, either.   I know that I shouldn't plan my whole life based on Y!A answers but I am just looking to get a clearer view on the whole situation, so please don't tell me I am being dumb. I just want to figure this out, my parents are not being any help :P   Thank you in advance!   ~Amatiel~

20090219233516AAOa3kv	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How deep is your role in a company as an intern?	I am a first year communications and international relations major. I have finished my internship at an NGO and decided to work for a health  care service company  that specializes in massage therapy until the start of my third semester to gain more experience and earn some extra income.       Apart from my boss and his partner we are all interns!  He claims that he is taking us under his wing and is guiding each of us in our respective fields, but he makes us do everything in his company. And most of us are biting more than we can chew.      As a communications intern I agreed to translate the company's website into two different languages and to write articles for magazines and newspapers about the company's health care sessions and courses. But he wants me to book radio and tv interview and make a deal with the ministry of tourism so that they promote his company to tourists. He also wants me to  work on the company's pamphlets and flayers  as well as help other interns write articles.       Furthermore he is disappointed that my articles have not been published by a major newspaper. I  believe most newspapers require the company to pay for the space of their advertisements, but he wants them for free. So i have to email and fax the adverts and hope that the newspaper has a spare space somewhere, but so far i have not had any luck.      The business, management and multimedia interns all have to "multitask" as well, even if it is not related to their field of study.      I have tried my best to accomplish the tasks set in the contract as well as the other ones but he has complained that my work has not produced any real income for the company.      Are interns usually expected to generate income for the business or institution they are working for? I think my boss is abusing his power over us. He repeatedly threatens us that he will not write a recommendation letter nor an evaluation letter for their university. He also reduces our monthly allowance by  30% to 50 %   when he is not satisfied with our work.       Some of the interns have complained to their colleges. Lecturers  have met with my boss but he usually fires the interns a few days later or they quit by themselves. He then quickly finds new ones to replace them. Is there any way that  I can prevent this unfair treatment towards my fellow students and towards myself?        To put  the icing on the cake, the place where i work is very dirty. There are piles of papers everywhere, the desks are dusty, the carpets are dirty and there are cockroaches!  Sometimes they crawl on my desk or on my feet. I spray my working area  and wear bug repellent, but it doesn't really help. Don't these sanitary conditions  break the health laws?        During my second semester, i wrote articles for a college newspaper that is  distributed to several colleges and universities around the city . I was thinking of writing an article on this internship experience for my college newspaper after i finish my term with the company so as to warn others and expose the company's ill treatment. Are there any ethical issues that would prevent me from writing about it because I was a former intern there?      thanks

20090219233623AA9KpDQ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Need help choosing classes that look good for College?	I'm currently a high school junior and will be applying to colleges next september (I know I'm way ahead of both early and regular), however my classes will show up on the infamous Mid Year Report. I have to select my classes for next year, and the only required class is an english class, otherwise I have Carte Blanche, as I've completed all my other grad requirements.      My dilemma is that most colleges want four years of math, four years of science, etc. I could do that, but I'd have to take the average level math class, that I might not do too well in (I suck at math) and average science, as I don't want to go near AP Physics (i've been in honors science for all other years though!).      Or I could take a bunch of AP courses that are more history related. Right now I want to take AP World History, AP English, AP American Government and Politics, French 6, Honors Band, and an Independent Study (because we don't offer AP European History anymore, and my mentor/teacher of 3 years/ the best history teacher at my school offered to let me take it). I'd personally rather take the more rigorous looking courses, because its actually an enjoyable senior year for me. Versus the average classes in subjects I just hate.      I'm applying to W&M (as an out of state student), U Virginia (same, out of state), UNC Chapel Hill (Out of state, again), Wake Forest, Emory, Boston College, and UMass Amherst (Safety; instate student). Will I jeopardize my chances (quite precarious for W&M) if I don't take math and science? Or is this an acceptable substitute, rigor and good grades over breadth of knowledge? (If it helps, I'm planning on majoring in History).

We've been exempt from most local laws, because we're Americans, not citizens of the countries we've been in.  Now, I need to return to the States, but not to my home state.  We will be traveling around, visiting different states, for perhaps a month at a time in each.  Of course, each state has its requirements about homeschooling - some require you to register, some want annual testing, some require college or parent certification.  I'm wondering as a non-resident of the state I'm visiting, must I comply to regulations?  Do I really have to register with each school system if I travel to a different town each couple of weeks?  How long do I have to live in a state before I'm considered a resident?  Or do I have to have a permanent address?        Has anyone else done this, or is anyone else doing this right now?

20090220001839AAIHDf6	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help me edit my english paper PLEASE!(I'M TO WRITE A SHORT STORY ON SOMETHING THAT HEPPENED TO ME IN REAL LIFE?	I was just fifteen. I was already living in Naples by then. School had let out on Thursday giving us a three day weekend. My parents had agreed to bring me to my grandmothers house in Miami to visit during the weekend. Little did they know what I was really looking forward to doing was just being with my old friends. The next morning after arriving at my grandmothers house, I called my cousin to see what was up for the night. It was the night that I never forgot.     Friday January/13/2006 it was already dark out. we were on our way to the metro rail to catch a train to sunset. Julian was telling me how things didn’t really change since the last time I was there. When we got to the train station I felt my stomach growling so we went to get some sausage dogs from some food cart. It was about nine o’clock, just the two of us waiting on the train to arrive when we saw a group of about four of five guys walking towards us. Julian seemed to recognize them. But not in a good way. They looked a bit older than us, they had to be in their twenties. Julian whispered to me “don’t punk out”.  One of the guys called out Jewels! Julian’s nick name as if he knew him. His name was Johnny Carson, he asked if we would spare some dollars for the train fare. Julian said no in an unfriendly voice.  That’s when they rushed us. We were on the ground getting kicked and punched when I saw some rusted pipe laying on the floor so I swung it with all my strength to the closest guy. It hit him hard enough to stop everyone in their tracks to pick up their injured friend as we ran down the electric stair case and ran through the government buildings. We slowed down at some bus stop where no one was in sight. I could feel the sweat dripping down my eye brow. Tasting the blood in my mouth and the feel of adrenalin rushing through my veins as the smell of sweet victory flowing in the calm night breeze hit my face. My senses keen to the slightest movement. angry voices coming from the alley we ducked behind some abandoned car in an effort to hide from the angry group as they walked by in a rush. A few minutes had passed when Julian said “everything is good, we can go know“.     We were walking for several minutes when I heard the sound of several gunshots so I turned around to see. All the people in their apartments ran outside. It was just another party for them to see just who they would know. It didn’t take long for me to realize those bullets were for us. We made it to the end of the street when a homeless man too doped up to pay mind to anything, was sitting on the side walk singing some old tune. I felt a pain coming from my ankle and the singing suddenly stopped and I looked down where I was bleeding. I couldn’t believe I got shot and this was just it? I always thought It would be more painful? that’s when Julian yelled “King“! A bullet had tore through the homeless man’s back as it went back through his abdomen and hit my ankle.     I almost threw up right on the spot. I could see the ripped, punctured skin.  He started to get pale and I could see tears roll down  Julian’s face. Julian must have known him. I screamed for help I don’t think anyone could hear and if they did they didn’t care. I hated every one at that moment. The old man lye here gasping and I wondered what could I do. I heard the sirens coming. When they finally arrived and were lifted him up into the ambulance, I sat there in disbelief. A policeman had told me we were shot at with a .44 magnum revolver and if it had hit me without slowing down and weakening through the mans flesh, I would have been gone.     I watched as they loaded the guys up who shot at us. They were found in some abandoned apartment. I wanted to stick a bomb in Johnny Carson’s mouth and watch it explode. To the police and reporters it was just a story. They didn’t feel anything since they didn’t know the poor man. I never thought I’d ever be back because it would never be the same there. So I wiped away the tears and left the scene just the way I got there. Though people said I was crazy and the night could have been better. I’ll never forget the night that King sang his lullaby.

Dostoevsky describes different types of faith or lack thereof in each of his characters: Alyosha displays an almost childlike, ingenuous faith, Father Zossima exhibits a turnaround from depravity to extreme religious devotion, and Ivan demonstrates a complete lack of present faith.

I'm not looking for that kind of opinion.      (1) I want to know what your opinion is on the quality of education (from your own experience).      (2) I'm curious if you've ever been a student of an educational institute/school that was accredited by DETC and if employers (or professional organizations) have accepted your education as legit.

20070429085039AAdxhfs	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	If I've earned a degree from a nationally recognized accrediting school, does this mean I can't find a job?	I am asking because I'm finding a lot of information concerning regional vs. national accreditation. When I took a certificate course a few months ago I didn't realize it was nationally accredited... not regionally.      I already know that most people feel that regional accreditation is better, I'm just worried that my certificate will mean nothing now. I think I'm getting into the regional vs. national mess to deep.      I'm not concerned about transferring credit to another school........... I'm worried about the employment aspect. Has anyone ever found a good job with a certificate or degree by a nationally accredited school?      Do employers even care about national vs. regional accreditation? Or is it only the schools that care?

20070731171754AAaAPOr	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	If I am taking 4 classes (12units or full-time) for school- how many hours of co-current work are reasonable?	They say for every unit or hour of class (12 hours lecture/wk for me) you should study twice as much outside class as homework (12 lecture, 24 homework= 36 hours TOTAL for academics alone). If I want a full load of 40 hours per week, would that mean I should only work 4 hours a week? That would be pretty embarassing to ask of my boss. I was thinking more like 10 and maybe study less for the less intense classes. My fear is the quality of my work declining, & quality of life- exercise level and relationship satisfaction is always so much higher in the summer :(   Tips are appreciated!

I'm currently majoring in physics and having a hard time with the math-- I GET the theory, but can't seem to get the equations to work out.  Anyways, I haven't declared a major yet, and have until December to do so.  Read my description of me on my facebook profile, and tell me what your first thought in your head is for what I should major in!!!   I'm a sophomore at a University. I'm pretty sure I want to write for National Geographic, but I also want to be a high school teacher, the chemist who discovers a cure for cancer and a vaccine for HIV, a member of our first interplanetary astrophysics team, a truck driver, a mother, and the President of the USA. I'll let you know when i have it all worked out: that might not be for a decade or so!

We're close"; I could be a fruititarian; I dress down or dress up...for me there is no in-between; I am not anti-social, but neither am I for it; I never wear normal bras; I haven't ever drank; I used to be that kid who sat alone in the cafeteria, and now I am that kid who sits with that kid; I'm an excellent racewalker; I will occasionally substitute the word "Phyllis" for the number seven; I am physically incapable of lying, as my body gives it away pretty clearly; I was born in the year of the dragon; I am the queen of the awkward moments; I sometimes eat a lot, and sometimes don't; I love to run in the rain; running is my anti-drug; I don't like movies without plots; I love to go to amusement parks; my puppy is my significant other; I could out-eat anyone in a gusher eating contest; I love roller coasters-the bigger the better; I want to be an actress when I grow up; I never want to grow up; I love to learn, but hate the homework; I miss my cousins very much and wish that we could see each other much more often; I have a thing for nerdy/geeky/smart guys with glasses (Dr. Daniel Jackson, Harry Potter, and Danny Messer are three of my favorite fictional characters); I am not a fan of professional sports; I have been to Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, Vatican City, and Germany; I was third in my high school class, first in my middle school class; though not actually related to any of them, Sky Lakers are my family, especially the music camp class of Oh-Phyllis!; I traveled across America in a 1996 Ford Taurus station wagon with all six members of my family inside; I have two dogs, a cat, and two rats at my home; I write poetry in my blog... just for the heck of it; I love Domino's Pizza; my eyes are bigger than my stomach; I read for fun... my mother never took the tv away, but she has banned me from reading; I am almost never early; I believe that smoking in all public places should be illegal, and that violators should go to jail...
