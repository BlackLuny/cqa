20090203150624AAHSuI2	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Back pain....what to do?	My lower back right at the tail bone has been giving me problems for weeks. It hurts from hip to hip so I guess it's hurting on the back side of the pelvic bone. I have done some research and it says sitting a long time can cause the pain. Even when I stand up or are on my feet for a long time, it bothers me. The pain medicine I am is not helping and no I'm not taking more than it recommends. It's not a kidney infection because I have been tested for that and it was negative. I don't know what to do. I have no insurance and I cannot go to a chiropractor. Please help. Any information will help. Laying on a heating pad only reduces the pain but once the heat is gone, the pain is back. I haven't done any heavy lifting or anything of that nature so it's not an injury. It's not my weight because it would've started bothering me a lot sooner. I'm sick and tired of this back pain because I cannot do any heavy lifting and that's going to bother me when I start my new job. I can't even bend down or pick something up off a floor or under a cabinet.

At first they work as good as other brands, but he has continued to loose hearing, really only "hearing" what he can read on the speakers lips.  I was investigating options, speaker systems, and teleloops - which require the hearing aid to use telecoil.  I couldn't find anything useful on their website, not even in the .pdf manuals.        Also, if anyone can recommend something like a speaker system that the phone could be plugged into, and/or set infront of the tv..something with multiple uses, or something to that effect :) would be greatly appreciated.

Is the silent treatment/disappearing act related to bipolar disorder or is he just a heartless loser who dumps a romantic partner without even discussing it or returning my calls, emails, voicemails, etc.      I guess theres nothing i can do is someone doesnt want to talk to me after being friends for  almost a year and intimate several times.

20090203152403AAeLM2W	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Atrial fibrilation - blood thinner problem.?	My wife has a heart condition but the docs can't find a remedy.      She has an implanted defibrillator.  Normally it would "shock" her heart into correct rhythm.        The Medtronic 3-wire ICD was recently replaced with a St Jude 3-wire model.  Apparently St Jude is superior.      Unfortunately it's programmed NOT to shock under most conditions.  As a result, she went into afib (out of rhythm) about a week ago and is in the hospital.  She's very weak.      The docs say they can't shock her now because she might have blood clots.  They have to give her blood thinner for awhile.  BUT they can't give her blood thinner because the last time she went to the hospital her gums started bleeding.        Apparently her blood is TOO thin already.  I think they are going to release her soon, still with afib and still with blood that is too thin but also still risking that the next shock from the ICD will release blood clots.      My argument is they handle this while she is still at the hospital.  Otherwise, it will happen at some random time in the future when she is not at the hospital.      My second argument is there must be blood thickeners that could be used before they use coumadin, which also should be administered while she is at the hospital.      It's a puzzle.  The St Jude ICD could be triggered and her heart could be stabilized.  If not, she might be too weak to go for dialysis, leading to worse problems.      Suggestions?

I get even more tired when I take Midol. I have heavy periods. But something new happened. I am going to tell you about my period that I got n January of this year and my period that I  have right know. Well 12 days ago which was 1/21/09 I believe. I had a dark brown discharge than it turned to a light hazelish brown color and I assume it was my period, and I had a tiny a bit of red blood for maybe 1-5minutes. I was spotting those colors for only a day and 1/4- 1/2. Then I got my period yesterday. When I went to the bathroom I had a clot that was 6-8 inches when stretched out but big as a dime or nickel. Than Got tinier clots last night. When I went to the bathroom this morning I peed out a lot of clots. The clots would be atleast big as a golf ball I guess or a face of a watch you wear on your wrist.  Oh and last night my boobs were hurting me really bad. Finally, I felt like I was going to throw up and I had a bad headache last night.

20090203154607AA9LIjR	Health;Other - Health	Anybody want to get taller?	This is for all of you wondering how to get taller. The answer is three simple things nutrition, hydration, body wellness. For nutrition you need some protein on top of all the other nutrients. about 20-30grams. for hydration you need about 30 oz of water or enough so that you feel refreshed.  lastly you need some exercise and adequate sleep. Try this and you will grow trust me. I grew 2 in. in about 2 months following this.

I just turned 14 about 3 weeks ago, I weigh between 105 or 110 and I am about 4'10". My shoe size is 5 (I usually buy size 7 shoes to make me taller and usually adds 2 - 3 inches depending on the brand). My mom is 4'11" and my dad is 5'2.5". I generally run from a short family on both sides from my mom and dad. But the later back I look the taller my relatitives are. My last name is Whynot. I generally don't exercise often because I have a club foot and asthma. I think I have a high or fast metabolism because I eat quite a lot and don't gain weight although lately I have gained a few pounds and not noticed. So anyways can someone help me find how tall I will be, my estimated weight and if I am at a normal rate for height and weight.

20090203154104AArLvR7	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Does it sound like I should see a doctor about my black eye?	On Sunday morning 2/1/09 (very early) I was punched in the eye (forehead and orbital, not the actual eye) pretty hard. It swelled up pretty good right away. I was at a party so I was unable to put ice on it right away. Yes we were drinking but I wasn't that drunk. I ended up going home about an hour later and went to sleep (I know, bad idea). I got up and iced it intermittently for about an hour and then the same about 5 hours later.  By the next morning I had a nice black eye. I never had any actual pain in the eye itself.      Anyway, it has been about 60 hours since the injury and my bruise seems to be spreading around my eye. I figured it would get better not spread more? Most of the swelling has gone down but there is still a little swelling. It is slightly painful to the touch and if I wink that eye hard. I also have had a bad headache since.I am just concerned because I figured the bruising would start to go away not spread and I also figured it wouldn't be as tender after three days. Im just not sure if this is normal and I am hoping you do. Thanks  Also, my neck is very stiff and I was wondering if this could be because of the fight?

I'm almost always sad, and even when I'm not the happiness just seems like a temporary distraction. I hate feeling this way. I've come so close to suicide multiple times, and both of times it was really serious the only reason I didn't do it was because my mom came home. My dad doesn't care about me or any of us. He hasn't been involved in my life at all and he just lost his job and all of a sudden he thinks that he can come in and try to be a father to me when he doesn't even know me. and my best friend, someone who i've depended on for years recently started being horrible to me without even trying to. So I was left for a few months feelings like I had no friends. I have new friends now but we're not that close and this isn't really something I can tell them. I only have one friend who I would consider telling, but I barely see her and I don't even know how to tell her or if she would understand. I feel like I'm always tired and I can't concentrate on school work without getting migranes, and because of that my grades are slipping. I've been swimming since I was very young and for the past couple weeks I haven't felt like going at all. Please help me. I'm tired of feeling this horrible and I don't want to kill myself. Who can I talk to? I'm afraid of telling my mom because she already has a lot to deal with and I don't know how she'll react. Please help.

But earlier today, I felt a dull, but persistent, pain in my lower abdomen, a couple inches above my lady parts. It didn't go away after a couple hours, so when I got home, I pressed down where it hurt and I feel a lump, and it hurts worse when I press on it.      I've never pressed down on this area before, so I have no idea if I'm feeling a normal part of my body, or if something is wrong. It still hurts... best way to describe it is a stomach ache too far down... Any ideas?

20090203161139AAiCsnk	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Is this seasonal affective disorder?	Or am I crazy?  Maybe I'm opening up the door for nasty comments, but I don't care.      I'm 29 and lived in North Carolina for nearly 15 years.  We moved  here from Florida when I was in high school for "a better life in North Carolina."  Everyone told me how lucky I was to be in North Carolina and have a better life... but I HATE it here.   I had a really rough time adjusting.  The thought of spending the rest of my life here makes my heart sink.    Sometimes I tell myself that I'll manage, that I'll get out.       It's snowing right now and I just feel overwhelmed with depression.  I've been crying all day.  I just lose my mind during the winter.           I studied abroad in Latin America as a senior in college and for the first time in years, I was happy.    I long to be back.  People constantly tell me how lucky I am to be in North Carolina and that I need to fall in love with North Carolina as my home, but my heart isn't here.  I just know I don't belong here.      We're having terrible weather right now, and I just feel hopeless when it snows.  I imagine being trapped in the dark, cut off from the world, immobilized, for days, maybe weeks.  I feel overcome with the fear that I'll never get out.      I can't stand North Carolina anymore and I am so scared I'll never escape.  I just want to go somewhere where there's plenty of sunshine and people talk to me in Spanish.  I hate North Carolina and I'm sick of the crappy weather and the nasty cold people.        I'm scared that I'm going crazy.  During the winter months, especially during winter weather I feel this way.  I am depressed and cry a lot.  My heart is in Florida, in Spain, in Mexico.  Anywhere but here.      What's wrong with me?

The doctors are not very forthcoming in their explanations of it and McMillan haven't been near yet,although i have phoned them for advice and counselling for my mam.      No treatment has started yet apart from stent inserted.The oncologists are trying to work out what to give him for a better quality of life.Chemo or radiation aren't supposed to be favourable for this type of cancer.So i don't know what they are going to do..

Ok, this is a dumb question, but I'm just curious what a dentist/orthodontist would do in this situation.                         Ok, let's pretend I have 2 crooked teeth and they are the ONLY reason why I'm getting braces is because of those 2 slightly crooked teeth...but anyway, on to the point.                   Let's pretend someone threw a iceball (not snowball) at your face, and it's hits those two SLIGHTLY crooked teeth and they break right were the gum begins, so the roots are still in there, but the seeable tooth is gone. If I went to the dentist, what would they do? Would they pull the roots out and put in dentures, or would they do something else? If they did put in fake teeth, would they straighten those fake teeth out so I WOULDN'T need braces, or would they put them back in the exact same position so I would still need braces?        Thanks.

I am sure I have this but my parent's said I was just going through "adolescence" or something like that, and that I would grow out of it.      But I hate it. I dread going to school. I feel like people are always watching my everymove and laughing at me. I can't think of anything to say when someone tries to talk to me, my mind is blank. And when I do say something it's stupid and I hate myself for saying anything at all. Sometimes I stutter. When I watch TV I watch it is so that I can "take notes." Example: If someone says "this" to me, I say "that" back. I feel it's better off for me to say nothing...But I'm lonely. I'm so lonely it hurts. And no one cares.      I want to kill myself rather than going through this torture every day. I can't take it anymore, I want to die. I'm a little careless...Like when I cross the street I don't even look. If I notice a car coming, I take the chance....Maybe this time they'll hit me.

A couple of nights ago I noticed bumps on the inside of the lips of my vagina, They weren't irritable and I would have never noticed them without reaching my hand down there. I inspected them in the mirror and they were just red little bumps on both sides of my lips, almost resembling a rash. When I went to the doctor she said it looked like the herpes virus but I was confused by this because I have never had unprotected sex? She took a swab of the sores and I will find out the results next week but in the meantime I am freaking out!! If it's not herpes what else could it be? If it is herpes how long ago would I have contracted the virus? I have eczema could it just be this? I havent noticed any other symptoms other than a slight ache in the groin area. The sores still look the same and are not pus filled or white, today they are a little more sore and are irritating when I walk a certain way. Please Help!

20090203161444AALLnhh	Health;Other - Health	Anger Problem Please Help!?	Im 14.  I think that I have a anger problem.  I wouldnt have thought so until just a couple of minutes ago when my computer for some reason stopped working, and now wont work(on a laptop now).  I had been working on an assignment for about 3 hours for school which is due tomorrow, and then the computer crashes, and I didnt save it at all.  That made me really mad.  I started swearing, punching the desk.  Then my 10 year old brother comes up to me to try to calm me down, but I shove him to the ground really hard, and am about to start punching him when I see that he is crying in fear, and that was enough to get me to calm down and realize what I had done.  I start to cry a little.  I would never want to hurt my brother.  He is my best friend.  And my brother looks up to me for help and advice.  So I sat down with him and tried to Comfort him, hugging him telling him that everything will be ok.  He did end up spraining his wrist, but other than that, he is fine.      I dont normally react like this.  It has only happened a couple of times, but has never been bad enough that I would try and hurt anybody.  So is this a sign that I have anger problems?  And how would I control my anger?

I run cross country and track, I keep a watch on my diet, and I don't have abs, strong arms, or anything for that matter. I have no shape, I'm not muscular, at all. I have that weird body type where I'm OK except there's like a pouch of fat on my lower stomach and small/minuscule love handles. This is embarrassing because when the team does max outs on weights I usually lift as much as the girls or less. This sucks, and I hate looking at the other guys who actually look good shirtless, it makes me die inside. The hottest girls in school always go for the athletic douchebags who don't know anything but to be douchebags and I'm just watching it as it happens. Damn genetics, unathletic family, and me.

Usually, the first day the sugar pills start, I stop talking them & I'll get my period. This time, I haven't.   Last month i accidently forgot to take it for 3 days and I got my period. Then, when the sugar pills came, I got it again, but lightly.   My boyfriend & I had sex last week & the week before, but he pulled out just to be safe even though I was on the pill. I took my pills regularly every night during that time.       Could it be because I technically had "two" periods last month that this one is coming a little late or may not come at all? Or could I be pregnant?      I need help! Thank you so much.

As the day went on, I noticed a small white bump on the rim of my eye, right next to my tear gland on my right eye. Now, right underneath the bump my eye is getting swollen. the bump is facing in and it is rubbing my eye (which hurts!) and it is sore to the touch and it hurts to blink.       I really cannot afford to go to the docter unless i HAVE to. what is going on with my eye? is this somthing that will go away over time? is it very serious??

Alright, I've been doing a lot of research since i decided to stop birth control about water retention and losing weight while getting off of it and i'm not really getting anywhere.

Within the first few weeks I blew up like a baloon, mainly in my midsection (which i never had a problem with til now !)

I've been off for two days and growing impatient. I'm cutting calories, drinking tons of water, and doing toning workouts...but i've been doing that while i was on bc....gr.

20090225071031AAjVxN7	Health;Optical	Contacts left redness in my eye?	I've been wearing contacts for about 4 months, and for the past few days or so my left eye has been having problems. It felt like there was something under them, so I took them out for a whole day, and when I put them back in they were fine. Until it sometime in the afternoon where it felt like it was screwed up in the upper part of my eye again. Unfortunately, I did not bring my solution or anything to work, so I had to wait til I got home to take them out. However my boss needed me to stay late, so I did, but it just kept getting worse. By the time I left I had to hold my eye open so it wouldn't burn. When I took them out the pain went away after a few minutes, but it's now a day later and my eye still has the same amount of redness in the same area. It's basically contained to a rectangle straight up from the edge my iris. Any ideas what's up?

20090304180933AAVuZYE	Health;Other - Health	YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	So, i have just read that reading about yawning actually makes you yawn. Lets try it out.    So, one day there was a little girl who went to school everyday, but, each day kept repeating the previous. The small girl started to get bored, so she would constantly yawn. Dute to that.The average yawn lasts about six seconds.    Your heart rate can rise as much as 30 percent during a yawn.    55 percent of people will yawn within five minutes of seeing someone else yawn.    Blind people yawn more after hearing an audio tape of people yawning.    Reading about yawning will make you yawn.    Olympic athletes often yawn before competition. Yawning is an involuntary action that causes us to open our mouths wide and breathe in deeply. We know it's involuntary because we do it even before we are born. Research shows that 11-week-old fetuses yawn.      how many times did you yawn?

There was no female nurse there because it was just for my stomach and then he was using the stethoscope and told me I had to take my pants off so he could hear my breathing better, but he said nothing about taking my undies off.  So I did it and then once I got back on the table he slide the stethoscope under my undies and like pulled them up and looked in, then told me I needed to remove them, I thought it was alittle odd, but hes a doctor so I did.  Then so he listened for a while then he kept doing the rest of the places and didn't let me re dress.  Then he told me to remove my shirt but then I asked him, "Why do I have to undress for this?"  Then he responded "So I can hear you better"  then I told him no just go under and he Just looked at me, and yes now I am still pantsless and he is resting his hand *down there* and by this point I'm ready to leave.  And now he goes for the "better look" under my shirt and then he stoped listening and felt my breasts then I told him "Is that how you are soposda do this?" he responded "Yes, I can feel the stomach problem in your breasts too" Then the exam was finished and he made me fill out the pappers STILL pants less.  LIke he handed them to me well I was still not coverd and wide open there.  So I filled them out and dressed myself with him still in there.  It seemed OK at that time but now I feel very upset that, that happended to me.  Do you guys think it was as bad as I do?  And when he was doing the stuff *down there* he pressed hard and it hurt quite a bit.  Should I report him, does that seem wrong? Please help me over come this, I'm feel very upset about this.   Please tell me how I can go about reporting him, or if its really not that bad   Thanksss   Oh and BTW I'm 19 and the doctor was a male around the age of 35.

Do i need to eat (reasonably) well & excercise more than usual to keep the weight off for the rest of my life?      2.How much should i excercise a day? I am only 14 (please no comments like "you're only 14, dont worry about your weight", because i am 5' 21/2'' and 130 lbs, which is considered overweight.) so i really cant get a gym membership, and i would prefer not to do excercise outside (other than walking) because it is kinda embarassing for a 14 yr old to go jogging...      3.How many calories should i eat a day based on my age, height & activity level?      4.Do you think i will be able to lose 15+ lbs by the beginning of may if i eat reasonably healthy, and do sit-ups, running for 30 mins, a bit of yoga, and a few lunges/twists everyday? And i am planning to continue on doing those excercises everyday after may, and eat a little bit worse, because i am not planning to eat very very healthy for the rest of my life...      5. once its may, and i continue excercising, but eat a bit more junkfood, will i automatically gain back all my weight & more?      6. oh, one more important thing. Do you even think this will actually work??      Thanks very very much.   Also please give me suggestions or corrections on my plan, because i would rather not work very hard to lose weight, and gain it all back...

I have recently heard several success stories about the south beach diet and it has definitely made me interested. I attempted the atkins diet a while back and I didn't like it much. I hear the south beach diet is somewhat similar but instead of eliminating all carbs, it separates the good from the bad. How so?      So far I have found out this diet includes lots of vegetables and grilled chicken and seafood. And then there is this whole thing about the first 14 days? and then your diet changes after that and you are allowed to eat more types of food?   Basically I don't know much about this diet and everywhere I look online, they are asking for a credit card number so you can be guided through this diet by an online team? Well I don't want to pay a web site for something I am perfectly capable of doing myself.       I want to try this diet. I want to lose about 20 pounds. Even 10 would make me happy. Of course exercise would help but what is this diet capable of with just eating the required foods alone?   What are the guidelines   What types of foods can I eat?    Any quick snack foods involved in this diet?   Does it work?   Any success stories?      I just want someone to explain this diet to me. I'm looking for a clear informational description from someone who isn't asking for a credit card number. I want a PERSONAL insight to this diet.      Help?         THanks so much =)

(nobody noticed, i didn't really move)      at night:   -right when i start falling asleep, sometimes i will catch myself in the process, realize it, and then just feel a rush of panic for a split second and wake right back up. sometimes it will happen 5 times before i'm finally asleep.   -another time when it happens is when i wake up around 2-3 in the morning, i won't be able to go back to sleep without turning my light on. turning the light on is a big step for me too...i'm just terrified to turn the light on, and sometimes i will panic if i don't get it on fast enough.   -it will sometimes drag on into the morning; i will wake up and get out    of bed, and feel a rush of paranoia   _______      i am not depressed, i live pretty much a "normal" life and i am usually not tremendously stressed out. the weird thing is, is that i panic for NO reason. i just panic. so it's gotta be something about my brain chemistry?      i'm just looking for feedback or any help/suggestions, please.   thanks.

20090304195656AAMaufb	Health;Women's Health	Are my breasts normal?	For the longest time, ever since I was fourteen, (I'm sixteen now), my breast's shape have been extremely weird. They're pointy, have huge areolas, and drop down. I have an inward curvature on the inside, but the curve on the outside is fine. My sister has called them "pig snouts", my mom says she's never seen anything like it, and I'm just overall really self-conscious about them.  They never seem to change, and I'm thinking of just getting them fixed.  There are many possible reasons as to why this issue, i guess, came about.  I did gymnastics a lot when I was younger from 3 to 13 for twelve hours a week, which somewhat stunted my growth. I didn't get cramps until 15, when I stopped excercising.  I'm thinking it also stunted my breast development.  I also think it has to do with my choice of preteen bras.  I wanted to be like my mom, who went to bed without a bra on because she was used to breast-feeding us as babies, and I got this self made thought that I should do the same (go to bed without a bra) because my breasts would develop normally that way. But no, I think they're shaped forever based on the way they developed. So my question is, do many other women have this problem, and is it normal? Or do you have any expertise on this sort of subject?

This was about a week after my period had ended. I was supposed to get my period on the 21st of February and it is now March 4th and I still haven't gotten it. I took a pregnancy test the day my period was supposed to be here (because it is almost always on the same day) and it was negative. I still haven't gotten it and I feel something on one side of my lower abdomen like a fullness and sometimes it is sore, other times it isn't. When I stretch I feel like I am tugging on something. I don't have vomiting or sore breasts and I don't think I am pregnant but because of the coincidence of the unprotected sex and the now almost 2 week late period, I can't help but start to get nervous. Is there any possibility this could be a cyst? Or could this be caused by the yeast infection I have just self-diagnosed myself with? Please help.

She has since gotten better and has been for roughly a week maybe week and a half. Anyways, in the last couple of days she is unable to eat hardly anything. She says she is very hungry and wants to eat, but as soon as she puts the food in her mouth it is an instant gag reflex, and she has thrown up a couple of times. She said other than that she feels totally normal, no other sick feelings. She is not anarexic or bulemic (sp?) I understand what both of these disorders entail. She got pretty upset about it today and I watched her try to eat the littlest bit of food and it was like torture for her. Could this possibly be a pregnant side effect or something else? She has taken two pregnancy tests and both have said not pregnant. Any help would be great!

My palms never sweat, and I only get "wet" in extreme heat or activity. I just get the feeling of being hot while everyone else is okay. Even now, it's cold with winter, but if we put the temperature above 70 it's too hot for me. I've been told by multiple people that I actually radiate heat. My thyroid glands and all that kinda stuff is normal. I've always been a pretty healthy person, and this certainly isn't the slightest bit debilitating. I just want to know why I get hot so easily!

20090304202009AAqYBub	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	I AM SO SICK OF ACNE?	ive been suffering from acne for about 3 years now.  nothing works.  nothing.  everything ive tried just fails miserably.   ive used stridex, biore, neutrogena, proactiv, retin-a, clindamycin.  all of them have done nothing and i just want clear skin, like almost everybody else i know.        whenever i start using a new product, it either really dries out my skin, or it hurts.  everyone says to use a moisturizer for my dry skin, but all it does is soothe it for about five minutes, and then my skin still looks flaky and gross.  then im told that if i keep using it for a few weeks, all of that would stop.  nope, just keeps peeling, over and over again, and the acne barely goes away.  is there anything i can do?  or do i just have to sit it out until it goes away by itself, if that even happens.  it has lowered my self esteem greatly, and i just want it to be gone.

I began to use them like 10 days ago which my period started that day. Some times I have my periods every month sometimes every 45 days, so my doctor told me to use b-control pills to regulate my cycles. I was having my menstrual cycle about 10 days ago and it stopped on the 3rd day. A couple days later there was some bleeding then it stopped after couple days again. I thought it's over until yesterday. I never had a sex in my life but I had touching- with my b.f yesterday. We didn't have sex though...Than I had bleeding again but that time the color was darker than my usual periods. I don't know if I would lose my virginity or not. I don't even know how can I learn it. Is there a proper way to test the virginity at the hospitals? I need some advice, please assist me. I appreciate...      Thanks

20090304221902AAEvqH2	Health;Mental Health	Friends with a psychopath???	Okay, so there is this person I met in high school and we used to be really good friends although she has always seemed a little off.   She was really smart yet rarely ever did her homework, anyway one day when we were sophomores (15) she showed me a gold necklace that she stole from her bf's mom. I was really surprised and told her she should put it back, but she just responded by getting really angry and saying she never should have told me but she thought I would understand; she was only mad for a few seconds then she just smiled and left… when I asked her about it later she denied the incident saying I might have dreamed about it and calling me crazy.   So a few years later (after we all graduated) I found out she went to an insane asylum for a while because they said she was a sociopath, after that happened everything from high school started to make more sense.   She was there for a few years and now she moved back, she seems pretty much the same just really fake as if she is acting though sometimes when I see her around children or when she is comfortable I can see parts of her old self coming back, she used to be wild and unpredictable but now she is more reserved and quiet.      What does this mean exactly? Do you think she is just putting on an act?   Should I stop hanging out with her and just start avoiding her?      The thing is sometimes when I talk to her about it she seems to be bragging about being a sociopath and other times she gets angry. The thing is I really feel like she loves me and I think she would be devastated if something happened. But is it possible for a sociopath to love? I heard it wasn’t but what if the person benefited the sociopath in some way I mean my friend seems to like interaction with others, so wouldn’t she be upset if they all died? She also seems to get along with children and like them, so what does that mean?

My friend is on the "Wild Rose D-Tox" cleanse, which consists of not eating sugars, wheats, yeast, and processed food, in addition to taking some herbal supplements and laxatives.       She is perplexed, because her poop has a fragrance like fruit, and doesn't smell bad, only sweet.       Does anyone have any insight??   What in particular might cause this?

20090304220354AAnVQY0	Health;Men's Health	My wife told me my penis is "average". Her first was bigger.?	Recently penis size came up in a late night conversation with my wife. My wife answered my direct question about size with a matter of fact average response for me. To hear my wife say the words average so coldly has really crushed me. Before you past judgment on me. I little back story. My wife told me wife I met her she wouldn't do certain sexual things because of a bad boyfriend in her past, and that her first time she was drunk and the guy to advantage. After we have been married I find out that she did certain sexual things to other people after her supposed bad boyfriend before she met me. When my penis size came up she said her first time was bigger. This crushed me because her first was a one night stand where she cheated on her boyfriend with another guy. When I first met her she mocked the penis size of the boyfriend she mocked. She said he was small. So this poor guy had a small penis and she lost her virginity to a guy with a big penis while dating him. I didn't think much of it, but turns out that guy she lost her virginity too, had a bigger penis than me also. I feel used. She lead me to believe that I was special and I was different than the other guys and that I saved her from her bad boyfriends. Turns out she knew all along when she told me my penis was bigger than thiers, she also knew my penis was smaller than her first. So my wife manipulated me to thinking she was some victim, all the while she was actually a person who cheats on her boyfriend with a guy, gives up her virginity to a guy a with a big dick, and mocks the guys she was dating at the time, by saying he had a small dick.
