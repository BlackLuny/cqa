ArtZzDU8aa	If you wanted to eat raw meats you can eat...  Beef (but you shouldn't eat much of that cooked or not)  Fish  Ostrich (the only poultry that you can eat raw "safely")    If you want raw dairy then I suggest getting yourself a goat.|`|9ilXVowLaa	am i understanding?  raw meat?  that's quite dangerous.  for raw,stick with produce and nuts/legumes.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	The Living Foods diet is vegan and doen't include any meat or dairy.  The Raw diet can be vegan, vegetarian or omnivore.  There are lots of people who include raw meat, fish, eggs and dairy. You can google for Aojanus Vonderplanitz, a proponent of his Primal Diet, or google for the Raw Paleo diet which is more balanced and more natural. People on raw omnivore diets experience all the same good effects of those on raw vegan diets but without the deficiencies/problems. Sorry folks, but it's true. 50% of raw vegans thrive, and 50% develop health problems which go away when they start eating either cooked grain and legumes, or raw animal products. I think the problem is not that the raw vegan diet is raw, or that it's vegan, but that the two together make it very restrictive. Wild animals live on either greens or meat as their staple. Vegetarian people throughout the world throughout history, have made grains+legumes together, their staple. (Rice and lentils in India, beans corn and squash for the Native Americans, soya beans and rice in China). If you're cutting out all the staple foods - no meat OR greens OR cooked grains + legumes, then I think you're asking for trouble. Of course raw vegans could make raw greens or raw grains+legumes their staples, but most don't. Greens are very expensive, its not possible for most people to buy enough, and the grains require a lot of processing (soak, sprout, grind, eat plain or dehydrate into bread/crackers...it's a lot of work) so most don't eat them 3 times a day. The raw vegans who do best *Long term* - over many years - are those who eat mostly fruit and greens with some fat. This is also how the other primates eat. Our closest relatives the chimpanzees eat 50% fruit, 40% greens.     Anyway, I digress. If you're asking if you can eat raw food + cooked dairy and chicken, then this would not be a raw diet. Heating foods creates harmful substances - this is scientific fact. The most harmful substances are those created when you heat meat and dairy.....cooking plant foods is far less harmful than cooking animal products. So if you're going to cook any of your food it should be the fruit and veg.   It's upto you what you eat, if you want to eat like that go ahead, but I think the cooked meat and dairy would undo the benefits of the raw food and would be a bit pointless. A lot of studies have shown how bad pasteurised dairy is for your health, and just about anyone whose given it up has found their health improved dramatically.    Raw dairy is perfectly safe to eat/drink. Those who say it isn't have no experience of it, they're just giving uninformed opinions.   I have an immune disease which makes me very vulnerable to infections. I only have to look at someone with flue or a virus or infection and I catch it. From when I got this disease, every time I ate cooked eggs I got really bad food poisoning. I noticed I didn't get this from cake mix, so I tried raw eggs, and found they didn't make me ill either. I tried cooked eggs again, and sure enough - food poisoning. For a while I ate 12 raw eggs a day in fruit smoothies and never once got ill from them. Even though they were past their sell by date. (I asked shops for eggs they throw away, for free, to wash my hair with, because I didn't want to buy them because of chicken-cruelty.)     In China they eat Century eggs which are not 100 years old, but they are fermented and way past their use by date.  Eskimos used to bury their raw fish, come back when it was rotten and eat it. Fermented fish was considered better than fresh.   I used to buy raw goats milk (not organic or grassfed just ordinary) and after a week it went solid. I would eat it like this (and this used to be a common everyday food in Scotland) and never got sick. I wouldn't have dreamed of eating sour pasteurised milk.   Rotten cooked food will make you very ill. Rotten raw food rarely will - and fresh raw certainly won't.     Raw milk used to be considered dangerous because of the risk of TB which could be passed from infected cows OR from infected milk-maids. Now animals are milked mechanically, the milk is not exposed to air so no risk of anyone coughing/breathing on it and the hygiene standards are much higher, and cows are carefully screened for TB. History is also full of cultures who consumed raw milk with no fridges, no hygiene AND no TB.    I would recommend you find raw unpasteurised dairy - preferably from goats rather than cows - and make your own kefir (a cultured milk product, like yogurt, only liquid, and much better for you). You can leave kefir to ferment longer and it will separate into curds and whey so you can make your own cheese. You can make your own icecream and with cows milk you can make your own butter and cream.     Eat cooked chicken if you want to but please don't call it a raw/living foods diet. Cooked meat/dairy is considered the very worst foods you could eat by raw foodists.    It is completely untrue what the above poster said about enzymes. A man called William Kelly used massive doses of enzyme capsules to cure himself of cancer. I know of lots of people who have experienced dramatic improvements in their health by taking enzyme capsules.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	No. Raw meat contains harmful parasites and bacteria that humans cannot handle. Raw goat's dairy is Ok *IF* it's organic and grass fed. Raw fruits and veggies should be the main part of your raw food diet.|`|Kru3PZbkaa	Please do not buy into the Raw diet.  It is nothing but a load of cr@p!  I've read the claims.  I'm also a health professional and can tell you that none of the claims make any sense.  Your body is not going to absorb all the supposed "enzymes" that are supposed to be so beneficial.  Once those proteins (that's what enzymes are) hit the acid bath that is your stomach, they will be denatured.  That's a fancy way of saying they will be cooked!!  No enzymes make it to the intestine without being denatured, so they can't be absorbed as claimed.  They will be absorbed like any other protein and used by the body to build the proteins it needs.  The same thing that would happen if you ate cooked food.|`|jR0GYS0waa	The benefits of raw food is an excellent way to lose weight on a naturally way and it will help you to improve your health.There are different recipes available which replaces the non vegetarian food.|`|AA10061441	contrary to popular belief dairy is very unhealthy the list goes for days why this is and why we are aloud to keep thinking that it is.     salmon is allright and halibut is delicious     i have a believe that if you go out in the wild and hunt the food yourself it will be a hell of a lot more healthy than HGH layden mass over farmed cows and chickens etc...|`|jenDDSr3aa	Starting a raw diet can be confusing!  I've lost 30 pounds so far and I'm getting ready for another 30. I have read and learned a LOT.      First of all, keep in mind there are many variations of the raw diet.  And you'll find lots of people who believe that their way is the RIGHT way.  You have to do what works for you.      For instance, there is 100% raw vegan, mostly raw vegan, 50% raw vegan, 80% vegetarian, "mostly raw", etc.    I fall into the later category, I'm "mostly raw."      I personally try to eat mostly raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, certain grains, seaweeds, etc.  I will have rare "normal" food and also will occasionally have meat.  I *try* to make good choices like lean fish and small amounts, but if it's Christmas and my aunt just made a roast, I may have a little - but I know full well what it will do to my body and I pay attention to the effects.  This helps me to have less or maybe avoid it next time.      My personal reasoning is this.  I don't want to take B12 supplements which many vegetarians/vegans have to take.  You can get this from meat, especially organ meats.  And you can eat a little and your body will store it for a long time.  I respect the wisdom of how the Native Americans around here ate before the Spanish arrived.  They ate fresh wild and grown foods.  They had a high-fiber low-fat diet and did not eat a lot of meat at all...but they DID have it once in a while at ceremonies or celebrations.  I try to keep that in mind.  I also keep in mind after I have meat, I will feel like poop.  :)  So I don't have it very often at all.      There are a couple great books by Natalia Rose.  Her books are for people who aren't ready to go 100% raw and allow transitional foods like fish, wild-range meats, goat cheese, etc.  I liked "Raw Food Life Force Energy."  She has two other books too, and google her name, she has a website.      You can also follow me on my blog which also features a vlog.  My blog is at:  http://www.bjaysblog.blogspot.com

It's not that expensive, only a few dollars a meal, so I don't see how it would be anything but cardboardy.    All of the "hype" is just commercials with paid celebrity sponsors.

j4a5kiu5aa	Hi.  It's not hard to be a vegan.  The only thing you will want to think about is B12.  You can get it from bee pollen, but if you are against that you can get supplements.    You might want to consider sprouting seeds.  Or mung beans, alfalfa, clover, anything!  They are rich in pytonutrients and protein.    Most people worry about protein.  You do not need as much as you think.    In addition to learning how to make killer salads, you can buy seaweed and make vegan sushi out of nori, lettuce, a sauce of your choice, and sprouts or marinated mushrooms.    Yeah, marinate some veggies in olive oil and a bit of Apple Cider Vinegar over night or longer and that's tasty.  Mushrooms, shredded cabbage, etc.    Sunflower seeds, almonds, cashews, these will be your protein and fat.  They need to be soaked in order to digest properly.  If you have food processor you can make nut pates.  Mmmm...  ex.  soaked sunflower seeds (overnight), some fresh herbs, fourth of cup of sundried tomatoes mixed in a food processor eaten on salad or on a sandwhich if you eat bread.        Be a smart vegan.  Don't eat white bread.  Realize that gluten is not great.  Do some research on it.      Fats!  You need them. Avocado, oils (coconut, sesame, olive, hemp, walnut, etc).        Make fake brownies.  Soak walnuts overnight.  Grind them in food processor with some cacao powder and a handful of pitted dates.  Put them in a container by pressing them down.  You have vegan brownies.        The possibilities are endless.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	If you have no idea where to start, becoming vegan today is not a good idea.  A vegan lifestyle requires a lot of dedication, planning, and knowledge, and if you don't go into it prepared, you are much more likely to fail.  You need to do some research before you decide to pursue a diet like this.  Both your body and mind will thank you.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Vegans consume NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS! That includes honey!!! You'll need to become an avid reader of food labels to make sure of that! Buy up on fresh fruits and vegies (or frozen or canned, whatever), soy milk or rice milk, brown rice, pasta, etc...Also, just because chips are vegan friendly, doesn't mean you should start living off them! A lot of new vegheads cut protein out of their diet without knowing they need it to maintain a healthy weight, so watch out for those empty carbs!  My favourite recipes include pasta with homemade tomato sauce and heaps of fresh herbs. Just cook the pasta according to the packet direction, and in a heated pan put in some olive oil, fresh or canned tomatoes (if fresh, cook until the're soft and easily crushed) and herbs (basil works well for this). Once cooked, drain the pasta and add sauce over the top, and sprinkle with roasted pinenuts. If you can find that vegan cheese, you could grate some of that on top but personally I don't like it.  Or you could always go for salads. Get some cos lettuce, fresh peas (straight from their pod!), sundried tomatoes in their oil, avocado, grated carrot, cucumber, green and red capsicum or any other good salad ingredients, then squeeze the juice of half a lemon over it! Yummy!  Soy breakfast smoothies are nice too. Get a blender and put a banana (broken into smaller pieces), a handful of frozen mixed berries, a teaspoon of psyllium husks and another teaspoon of mixed berry yoghurt, and blend until smooth!|`|AA11123061	if u plan to quit meat producs than add these in ur diet :    toufu , it has the proteins of meat  mushroom , it replaces chicken  soy milk instead of dairy milk  introduce more vegetables in your meal ,like salads .   u can become vegan although meat has its own nutrients too .|`|AA10824931	Total vegan?  Buy organic only.  You will go through a detox the first week and it will be challenging.  Stick with it and after one week you will start to feel better and begin to feel like super man.  You will also become more psychic.  I recommend going to the Optimum Health Institute in San Diego or Texas. Good luck and make sure you are getting enough B-12.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	Strictly speaking, vegans also get rid of ANY PRODUCT THE EXPLOITS ANIMALS:    Honey, milk, eggs, meat, Rennet (cow stomachs), Gelatin(animal collagen I believe), leather, silk, wool, fur some beers, wines and spirits (some are filtered through animal organs!)... lanolin,  whey, casein, beeswax, isinglass, and shellac.    Becoming a vegan is very hard and demanding. about 60% of all supermarket items contain at least a small amount of one of the above additives. So find a health food store or get used to reading labels! If not, perhaps start off vegetarian and ease your way into Veganism, if that's still your goal... I call myself a vegan, but I don't look out for all the things above in great depth, I simply don't eat meat, eggs and dairy. Perhaps I shouldn't call myself vegan? :P Good luck, you're embarking on a hard but very rewarding lifestyle !!!|`|L0a3Q1Rqaa	So you want a bunch of strangers on YA tell you how to be a vegetarian?  Go to your local library and take out a couple books on vegetarianism. Buy a vegetarian cookbook or two.
36a3ynpJaa	Humans evolved as opportunistic carnivores.  We started by using rocks to break open large bones in lion kills to get at the marrow and eventually learned to hunt.       There are simply no indigenous cultures that are vegetarian. Hunter gatherer humans have been in existence for over a million years and if you look at Aboriginal cave paintings, they were hunting.      We have canines and molars, just as dogs and pigs do.  We are not lions but we like many other animals, will eat meat when we have a chance.    Our teeth are NOT like a cow or sheep's teeth.    As for people who say meat is dangerous, well salt, fat and sugar are dangerous too if you eat too much of it.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Mankind lived on meat for well over 100,000 years.  It's only been within the past 10,000 years that people have figured out crops like wheat and barley and peas and beans.  People exist best on meat - and that's the Atkins diet.      You can certainly exist without meat, but that means you have to eat grains all the time and lots of people are allergic to grains, especially wheat.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Meat is unnessecary. It already supposed to make up a small fraction of your diet, so eliminating it wouldn't cause any problems.|`|AA12334360	Thankyou for you previous unsolicited insulting emails, its always nice to know just exactly how mature people are when i reply to them.    We don't "need" meat. if we "needed" it then all vegetarians would die, wouldn't they ?    "get your point "?     No, i have no clue as to what point you are trying to make. Absolutely none at all    If you have to en-list the help of the local gas company to make your food palatable then its probably not a very "natural" thing to eat    most vegetarins do not care if their body is designed to eat meat or not. There are many things I am capable of but it doesn't make them automatically right.    Fortunately, some of us have evolved to be able to make decisions rather than rely on instinct.|`|VdbhuUYBaa	The Original Cosnipa. A not so original troll.    "Are we designed to eat meat?"-we aren't designed at all.    "Is it just not a necessity?"-Because we can get the nutrients we need without eating meat that makes meat not a necessity. That's difficult for you to comprehend? Wow.    Also, the other non-"necessities" that you list usually don't result in death and suffering, which is the point of the whole issue.|`|t0vuwuGXaa	Nature has a great way of telling us this: we are able to eat meat and digest it, thus we are "built" to eat meat.  Example:  I had a steak for dinner last week and I am fine now.  Sorry to be a smart ***, but it is really a ridiculous argument.    For the "raw" argument, I had beef carpaccio last week, and I am fine now.  (beef carpaccio is raw steak)|`|AA12031316	Think about it-if we were "designed" to eat meat, we would have the ability to chase, catch, capture, and kill our prey and consume it without the use of tools or cooking.  We are the only species that does none of those.  All carnivorous animals can eat their meat raw.  Humans get sick if they consume raw meat.  We have only 4 tiny pointed teeth, as opposed to a mouthful of canine teeth that other carnivores have.  The rest of our teeth are flat, like other vegetarian creatures.  With our imposable thumbs, and slow gait, we are MUCH better suited to gardening, gathering fruits and vegetables, all of which we can consume raw without getting sick.  That pretty much sums it up, doesn't it?  As for our nutritional needs, we can get EVERY vitamin, mineral, protein, enzyme and all of the other nutrients a human needs from a plant based diet.  I like your point though-giving you a star!|`|FicyC2TXaa	Get your point? No, not really.    We weren't 'designed', we evolved.    Eating meat isn't a necessity; just as we no longer NEED (in the west anyway) to live in caves or to kill animals and use their skins as clothing, so we no longer NEED to eat meat to survive.    And because we're omnivores we can exist healthily on a meat-free and plant based diet if we have to, or if we choose to.    And so some people choose not to eat meat; others make a different choice.    Meat isn't necessary to health. Nor are melons or porridge oats. People make choices based on ethics, or preference.    What exactly IS your point?|`|MidmHtp5aa	We are designed to eat meat.  We need to eat meat.  Studies have shone that vegetarians and vegans have a harder time giving birth, and have a weaker immune system (get sick easily).  Besides, why deprive yourself of something this wonderful?|`|b9uOax0aaa	I doubt that we absolutely need meat but I intend to keep eating it as long as I am alive.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	"evolutionarily, humans are meant to eat meat. it is the reason we have molars, etc..."    Well actually, the molars are flat and ridged. Designed for "grinding" and "chomping" down/through tough vegetables, not for ripping apart animals. Look in a cow's,  a sheep's, a horse's,  goat's (the list goes on) - they all have these "large, ridged" molars, used for grinding grass, and so forth. If you're opening sentence is wrong, I didn't bother reading the rest. Sorry to burst your "we evolved to eat meat" bubble.   If you can catch a chicken with your bare hands and eat it without so much as feeling even slightly remorseful, freaked out or repulsed, then I'll agree with you, we are indeed omnivores... Until that day, I'd much rather pick a mango with my bare hands and eat it raw! :)    If we "evolved" to eat meat, we wouldn't be innately repulsed by even the slightest hint of killing an animal without a tools or a gun. A tiger would have no trouble doing so, simply because nature as evolved them to have the urge to. I can sit here all night telling you exactly how our bodies have evolved over millions of years to eat fruits and vegetables, and sit here even longer telling you why we're not meant to eat me, but I'd much rather you do the research. Try google first!      "Nature has a great way of telling us this: we are able to eat meat and digest it, thus we are "built" to eat meat."    -- We can digest cardboard too, should we eat it?|`|uT44Ae03aa	It's a little bit of both I think. I think there was a point in our development when we needed to eat flesh to survive. That's why we have meat-eater like teeth, eyes in front, all that good stuff. Of course back in those days we were a lot more muscley and lived in caves. We've evolved into physically frail creatures. We're obviously no longer supposed to be hunters. We developed agriculture and that now makes up the largest part of our diet. Our teeth and bodies would no longer allow us to kill a large animal without tools. And of course meat isn't a necessity, that is absolutely obvious. I find it hard to understand why some meat eaters continue to preach that meat is necessary when there are millions of thriving and healthy vegetarians all over the world. It's not some conspiracy that vegetarianism works, it's real-world fact.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	Yes. We do not need meat (apparently we can get b12 somewhere else)    Everyone that says we cannot hunt animals with our bare hands: Yes, that is why we EVOLVED from apes. we can build tools like spears to hunt our prey (well actually just the men, the women gather and defend the nest)    To Ray P: It is simply a social stigma. If a baby grew up around its parents that wrung the heads off of chickens, and no one was there to say 'it's wrong', then, when it is able, the baby would have no problem doing so itself.|`|v2PP7kNlaa	evolutionarily, humans are meant to eat meat. it is the reason we have molars, etc...    also, there is a vast amount of vitamins and proteins we get from meat that isn't necessarily easy to get from other food sources    in conclusion... MEAT IS GOOD|`|RpgoBWZ2aa	it's not a necessity...however, if you have a great option like meat in your diet, why would you not eat it?    think of it like this...  you have the opportunity to win 300$ by doing nothing...do you do it?  of course you do.  is it necessary? no.|`|cCUVwsMvaa	have you ever looked at your teeth? are they similar to a lions or a cows? we are not built to eat meat. dont get me wrong...im a big meat eater, but our bodies arent meant to eat it. do we have the speed or strength to go running after an antelope? do we have the stomach acid to digest it without getting sick. of course not. but if we eat a carrot out of the ground or an apple out of a tree we'd be fine.      also...we dont get anything important from meat because when we cook it, it loses almost everything good in it. we get everything we need from vegetables and fruits. meat is not a necessity.|`|LCIf7Jokaa	We evolved to enjoy meat and eat it. But it is not necessary any more, we are just stuck in a stupid tradition and say its ok coz 'we've been eating animals for thousands of years' or coz 'other animals eat animals'. Animals have to hunt for survival, do we? And saying because its been happening for a long time is a stupid excuse. Think about it.     Eating meat is no longer a necessity. We can live perfectly healthily without it. And it be MUCH better for the planet if we stopped over-feeding animals to eat them and just ate the crops ourselves, do you know how wasteful that is? We're over-feeding cows SO much so they can be fat, to feed maybe about 10 people? But the crops used to fatten them could have fed 30.     Yes its a tradition to eat meat, and we have evolved to enjoy it but these simply aren't good enough reasons to destroy the planet, slaughter millions of animals and make everyone overweight.     I think people prefer to be brainwashed by the meat industry then actually THINK about what they're eating. I'm not anti-meat, its a choice. But people need to learn about this and stop being told that we need meat to be healthy, we DON'T. We've just become so used to eating meat that we don't know how to stop, and don't even want to.    Besides most meat these days isn't even nutritional, what with all the hormones and preservatives they put in there.    xx|`|32uGH3cVaa	yes i get your point.  many things in life aren't necessary.   and i agree that a lot of things EVERYONE does isn't necessary.  i don't think that we're not designedd to eat meat.   i personally think its better on our bodies not too..  but whatever about that..   its just that you don't need it to live because its not a necessity.   and neither is being on Y!A at 2 am in the morning when i have school tomorrow. :(     haha.|`|6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	We are built to be gatherers; but technology gives us the choice of being an omnivore or herbivore.

I haven't eaten meat for 20 years and I have seen carnivores die young from heart disease, bowel cancer and the effects of obesity.

The meat eating man was only designed to last forty years which is why so many meat eaters start to get chronic diseases after that time.|`|J54q2aVtaa	It isn't necessary, and the reason it is very different from listening to music is that living creatures aren't killed just so you can listen to the music.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Humans need protein.

But seriously, humans were meant to be herbivores.  Check out our teeth!  We don't need meat.|`|PuPQF8QIaa	Yes you do need meat, if you haven't noticed it's still apart of the food pyramid. It contains essential proteins, and iron and some other junk that i can think of...    We are designed to eat meat, we have "canine" teeth for tearing, molars for mashing the crap out of our food.   but i understand what you're saying how some vegetarians use the argument that meat is not necessary yet they do or have things that aren't necessities. That is they hypocrisy that is the human race.    There is room for all of "God's" creatures....right next to the mashed potatoes.|`|b9wICW1Paa	I would agree with many that in this day and age, meat eating is probably not a necessity.  But we certainly evolved to eat meat.  We cannot apply modern food predjudice to our ancestors and many groups living today to determine what we were "designed" to eat.  Many living even in the present do not have any qualms with eating raw meat, offal/organs of every kind, blood, insects, raw eggs, scavenged carcasses, and others that the typical citizen of a modern industrial society would find disgusting or otherwise unappealing.      Fire and tools are not necessary in order to capture or eat meat. Humans are capable of running long distances slowly, while many animals, even deer, antelope, and gazelle, can run very fast over short distances, but do not have the endurance for longer distances.  Early humans were known to run these creatures to death over long distances.  Many other creatures, such as frogs, snakes, fish, shellfish, insects, lizards, alligators, as well as their eggs, can be caught and consumed with nothing but our bare hands and teeth.  And our intelligence and cooperative ability has always been such that we could outsmart many animals by corraling them into pits, over cliffs, or into another trap of some kind.        But back to the question at hand.  Although meat might no be entirely necessary, animal product consumption is necessary for optimum health.  Sure, vegans can supplement with Vitamin B12 and other nutrients that are richest in animal sources, but digestion is not just about nutrient quantity.  Just as important is nutrient bio-availability and absorption, and many plant based nutrients will offer neither of these critical digestive considerations.       So in my opinion, and that of many others including researchers and scientists, we can survive without meat and animal products, but we cannot thrive.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It's completely unnecessary and the proof is in all the people who live a healthy normal life without any meat.    You're right about those other things but they aren't hurting anyone if people are responsible.

You may not know this, but for each person in America 100 animals (approx.) die each year. (I'm Australian, I'm sure it's a lot less for us)... But regardless. The USA alone consumes 10billion, that's 10,000 million animals each year.... Not to mention every other country....    Even if you still eat chicken, imagine all the pigs, cows, turkeys, ducks, fish you're saving!  Also buy free range chicken - the animals aren't as abused as much...    Geneveve:  Do you know that beef contains 14 essential nutrients that your body needs everyday?    - Yes, I did know that, did you know soybeans contain 19 essential nutrients your body needs? Not only that, but A LOT less saturated fats and more healthy fats. It also contains Omega 3 and 6! 10times more fibre, and is more easily digested! It also contains no cholesterol.    Protein is vital for muscle growth and provides great energy for your body.    - Yes youre right, protein is good for muscle growth, but doesnt have to be animal protein. And strictly speaking no, it isnt great energy for your body. In fact, it is very inefficient and resource consuming energy. Carbohydrates are your brains preferred source of energy (Glucose in particular), which is abundant in fruits and vegetables, and relatively non-existent in meat.    The best source of protein is from beef.    - Sadly, youre wrong again. Considering the protein/kcal and along with saturated fats beef as been deemed too high in sat fat and cholesterol, too low in vitamins and minerals, and not high in fibre, carbohydrates or calories. As a result soy protein as been deemed the number 1 protein. Its a lot cheaper too! And poor innocent animals dont have to suffer. You can grow cows on a plot of land and feed 50 people, but on the same size plot, you can grow soybeans and feed 1500 people. Which is better in the long run for the sustainability of the planet and for food?|`|AA11454606	If you are thinking about becoming a vegetarian because you can no longer bring yourself to eat the creatures that the good lord put here for you then yes you must give up your chicken otherwise why do it?

These nutrients can be found in all the cuts of beef, such as, ground beef, roast beef, and even great tasting steaks.  Beef also contains, zinc, iron and protein.  Zinc is an anti-oxidant that helps to prevent early aging of the skin and muscles of the body. Iron is great at helping to carry oxygen through the body. Having too little can greatly affect your mood and your alertness. Protein is vital for muscle growth and provides great energy for your body.    The best source of protein is from beef.  Worried about calories?  Sirloin tip is very low in calories, almost the same as chicken with the skin removed.    Protein should never be cut out of your diet.  To keep looking great, continue to eat all proteins, cut back on your in take of prepared or packaged foods, junk foods, sugary snacks.  Even fruit juices are not good for us, they are very high in calories.  A glass of water and a piece of fruit is a healthier alternative,  this way you are getting all the fiber in the fruit as well.  As my wise mother taught me, everything in moderation.    Ray    I don't know what planet you are on, but here on earth, we can only grow certain crops in certain areas.  Yes!  Soy beans  are a productive crop in certain areas.  Ever travelled to western Canada?  This crop cannnot be produced here.  In some areas of western Canada, the best and indeed the ONLY choice for agriculture is cattle, they can travel the terrain, and enjoy the freedom exploring of muliple quarter sections.  Their lives have been created for us to use as food.  Read Genesis.  You stated  the importance of "saving another innocent animal, what are we to save these creatures for?  You are not correct in your statements,  actually Beef is the number one economical choice per acre.  Best to do both sides of the math.  We are agricultural producers  and deal with those who grow a wide range of crops, you could say we have our hands in all the pots, because of this are knowlegable about costs and markets, land usage, what yields best per acre.    Our cattle live very well, are tended to medically much better than we are in the health care system, have the very best pastures, minerals, grains.  We treat them carefully, and as naturally as we can, keeping them stress free, but also protecting them from predators, disease and any other harm that we can for see, or that may come their way.    For us, yes, this is a choice, but one that we think is best, God put these animals here for us to consume, and yes, we earn a living from raising them.  Don't believe all that you hear from others about beef ranching.  Go and see for yourselves, talk to producers.  Much of what you hear is very exagerated, propaganda.    We are all free to make our own choices, and I am not insulting yours.  Keep that in mind if you choose to respond.|`|4f43b9242d5aa0dc25198e8a354c3794aa	Most probably you are rejecting the blessing of God if you force restrictions on yourself not eating meat.|`|b916f6962d68b4ccca7c451250580511aa	Chicken was the first meat I gave up when I started cutting meat out in Winter 1997 and by Spring 1998 I was meat free.

AA10636233	baking soda will fizz in reaction to citric acid or lemon juice as well. My 8 year old loves finding different acids and testing their reactions with baking soda. We do these "experiments" several times a week. Our next test will be with cola since she read today that coca cola can be used to clean mineral deposits out of toilets because it is so strong. Baking soda is Sodium Bi carbonate, so it contains sodium and carbon both. Her favorite experiment was the beer salt(actually dried citric acid) that they sell at gas stations. She added it to a tsp of water, stirred it until dissolved and then added the baking soda. She got such a kick out of watching it fizz over its little paper cup like that!|`|0652e17f9d7b965dbf45d90fb460f124aa	When vinegar is added to sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it produces a volatile mixture of carbonic acid rapidly decomposing into water and carbon dioxide bubbles, making the reaction, "fizz". It is exemplified as the typical acid-base reaction in school science experiments. The salt that is formed is sodium acetate. This also serves as a qualitative test for some carboxylic acids.

Dom Perignon is expensive but good.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	I agree with Amanda.  Perignon is expensive however.  I'd go with it's clone "Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin"at about 1/3rd the price.  Highly rated and hard to tell the difference( unless your an absolute Champagne expert).  That's usually $50 or so.  If you don't want to spend that much and want a bubbly, go with an Asti Spumante.  I like Martini and Rossi the best.|`|xX9D292Laa	Parrot Bay Mango or  Mike's hard lemonade

qzY2tRTeaa	Have everything at room temperature. To the bowl of your food processor, with the steel blade at ready, add:      2 egg yolks    1 whole egg    1 Tbl. French style mustard    grind of black pepper, or bit of white or red    pinch of salt    juice of lemon      Turn on food processor, and let run for 10-15 seconds. Then, while still running, dribble in:      2 cups oil.      Use corn, peanut or other oil. For the distinctive taste, some or all of the oil can be olive. Be careful though, in a Mayonnaise made with all olive oil, if the oil is the least bit heavy the Mayonnaise will be a heavy thing indeed.      When all the oil has been added, shut off the machine and taste the Mayonnaise. You might want to add a bit more lemon juice or salt. This is also the time to add a bit of Tarragon, or a few chives, maybe a tiny touch of a fine curry powder, or anything else that might give it a distinctive flair. Whirl it few more seconds, and scrape into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Enjoy fresh and warm, or chill well before using.|`|a7w97D43aa	I  can    condensed milk, 1/2 can brown vinegar, same can as you just emptied condensed milk, 1tspn dry mustard powder, 1/2 tspsalt.

It's worth it, and it slows you down so you can enjoy your food, not just gobble-gobble-gobble.     In Japan, strangely enough, they swallow the seeds, but spit out the skins.

xBdTAVljaa	Ciao    Un alimento sottoposto a congelazione pu rimanere in queste condizioni x un tempo illimitato....l'importante che non venga interrotta la catena del freddo e che le temperature del congelatore siano inferiori a - 18C / -20C (che sarebbe il punto eutetico delle soluzioni di NaCl.).

PENSA UN PO CHE NELLA TUNDRA SIBERIANA ancora oggi si estraggono le carcasse intere di MAMMUT (elefanti preistorici)..... molti dei villaggi della Yacuzia (russia) hanno anche mangiato la carne di questi mammut perfettamente conservati dal ghiaccio e l'hanno trovato buono.

ZeE0749uaa	Okay, how about a Hawaiian themed party! You can have lias and tropical drinks, and cool party favors. Definitely have games like apples to apples, etc. and maybe outdoor games! If you have a pool that would be great. You can also  do spa stuff like make masks or paint each others nails.   Here's a site with other ideas:     http://familyfun.go.com/parties/birthday...    happy birthday&&have fun!|`|pYm11JqYaa	Karaoke is fun.  Really...    Twister    Charades    Movies    You could even have a few board games out if people want to play them...like Pictionary, Apples to Apples, ...    Round up some airsoft guns from friends and neighbors    Video game playoffs (single elimination)      If you want to go with a theme, I think a beach theme would be really easy...since everyone is on those lines anyway.  Another fun one would be to have a costume party.  Halloween was 7 months ago, so I'm sure people would love to dress up!|`|5X0AQHYZaa	well, no Alcohol-why- because it's bad for you. Try finger foods-----buffalo wings, mini-corn dogs, french fries---things of that nature.  Try having fun thinking games, like:  hit or miss  cards    or create one.    have fun!!    And for the theme try maybe   hollywoood  bowling  school like  poker  beach-like  wacky tacky  or anything of your liking.|`|AA11883275	Themes are always fun, but maybe simplifying it like hawaiian theme girls can wear hula skirts and lays...

You do pictionary, trivia, mold things with clay, cherades etc.|`|a4dd07a758c4e98160ec4b411dfd61c2aa	There are LOTS of great ideas posted here already, but here's some input from someone your grandma's age.  If the party is going to be held at your home, I really liked Rebel G's idea of make-your-own-pizza (bagels, English Muffins sliced in half, with plenty of topping options); plus movies, popcorn, beverages.  Also, a costume party is usually fun, long as you keep the theme simple (dress like your parents, or your favorite or LEAST favorite teacher, etc.), but that's not quite enough to keep the gang entertained all afternoon/evening.  Interactive board games like Pictionary are always fun.  If these are your 12 closest friends, figure out what it is you all have in common, & go with that. You're 12-13?  Absolutely no alcohol, & no smoking of anything, etc... Don't even be tempted.  The consequences will be detrimental, & not fun.  Not a good way to end the year or a party.|`|QvxUDjdGaa	dont drink alcohol|`|7h0CJMXGaa	Well your forgetting the most importent part....

s4WywJ8baa	No, hard boiled eggs do not have to be shelled immediately. They are usually good for one month after cooking.    The proper method for cooking hard boiled eggs is this:    A large pot. With enough water to cover all the eggs you are hard boiling by three times. Liberally salt the water, and add 1 cup of white vinegar. The vinegar will stop any eggs with cracks from leaking too much.    Bring the water to a rolling boil.    Place the eggs in one by one with a large kitchen spoon.    Wait for the water to come back to a rolling boil. Set a timer for 19 minutes.    Get another large pot or container and place a bunch of ice in it with cold water.    When the timer goes off, drain the eggs immediately. Then get into the ice water as soon as possible.    Let cool for about 15 minutes or until the ice melts.    Store them in the fridge in a clean container.    But if you need them right away... when the ice has melted, the hard boiled eggs peel so easily its not funny.    )Yes I am a chef too.)|`|da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	Assuming you must be speaking about boiled eggs.  I boil several every Sunday night, and just store them in the refrigerator never cracking/peeling until they are to be used/eaten.    We eat boiled eggs as snacks all the time, as well as egg salad sandwiches for hungry kids after school, and I just love them when I am hungry in-between meals sprinkled with salt and cayenne/black pepper.    Hope this helps ;)|`|c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	Like everyone else said, you don't have to do it. It's fine as is.    But, if you are in a hurry, cracking the egg shell will let the cold water in more easily, make it easier to peel, and cool the egg faster. So, if you are eating them right away and want them cool, I would do it.    But if you are storing them, leave them uncracked -- it's more sanitary, and they will last several days uncracked. (Cracking them will also let bacteria in, so you'll want to eat them quite soon if you crack them.)|`|4eLzY2hfaa	you might find it more efficacious to prick a hole in the large end of the egg shell prior to cooking, a thumb tack, or pushpin works fine.  this will equalize the pressure inside the egg.  when the egg is removed from the cooking bath crack the egg completely and peel shell from the pricked end upward.  a little bit of vinegar, and salt in the cooking bath will prevent the egg from running through any other larger crack in the shell.|`|PlEEZTRsaa	No,not if it's boiled.|`|ftVXoyOUaa	no? crack it when you want|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I agree.  I don't crack hard boiled eggs at all unless I am to use them right away.  I do however like to crack my eggs prior to cooking when making breakfast.|`|93AgePoZaa	No, if its hard boiled you cool it in cold water and then you can put them in the fridge for a few days|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Do you mean for hard boiled? Cuz other wise you should crack the shell Before it is cooked.    No. There is no need to. I cool my eggs completely, over night even. I actually keep them in the peel until I eat the egg.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	You mean hard boiled?....I often leave them in the shell for days.
s4WywJ8baa	Well, get a rolling boil going, with salt in the water (my rule of thumb for pasta and blanching veggies is the water should taste like sea water). Use Kosher of sea salt.    For snow peas... blanch them no longer than a minute or until they look a nice shiny green.    (Yes I am a chef too.)|`|da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	Hope this helps ;)      "Does it matter how long vegetables are blanched?    Blanching time is crucial and varies with the vegetables and size. Under-blanching stimulates the activity of enzymes and is worse than no blanching. Overblanching causes loss of color, flavor, vitamins and minerals.

I get down when my freezer is full, because I can't cook to stock it up. I like Indian, Chinese but especially Italian, for it's simplicity and passion.     One of my favourite Italian recipes is this one. It just gives such a luxurious result from so few relatively simple ingredients. I shall be cooking it for my Valentine on the day.     SMOKED SALMON TAGLIATELLE    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS     125g pack of smoked salmon pieces  2 cloves of garlic  1 onion  1 tablespoon of olive oil  1 tablespoon of flour  150ml carton of single cream  1 teaspoon of mixed herbs  At least 300ml of water    ? of a teaspoon of salt  200g of tagliatelle  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Cut the smoked salmon into 2cm (1 inch) pieces. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion has gone soft. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the flour and stir until it has absorbed the oil and juices in the pan. Add the cream, herbs and smoked salmon. Stir and cook for about a minute until it has made a smooth sauce.     Put the water and salt into a saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to the boil. Add the pasta. Stir it to stop it sticking to the bottom of the pan. Bring back to the boil and continue to cook. Stir frequently to stop it sticking.     Begin testing it about 2 minutes before the packet instructions say it should be done. The best way to judge if pasta is cooked is to bite it. This is tricky, because if you fish out a bit and stick in your mouth you may burn your mouth on the boiling water. Wait a bit and blow on it, then bite it. If it is hard it needs longer. If it is chewy (or al dente, Italian for to the teeth) it is ready. If it is soft it is overcooked.      Drain the pasta in a sieve or colander.     Always take the pasta to the sauce. Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir together until thoroughly coated.     Season with the pepper.    ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS    Use crme fra?che instead of the cream.     The half cream, half green mixed tagliatelle (called paglia e fieno, or straw and hay) looks really good with this sauce.     TIPS    If you use enough water, add the pasta when the water is boiling, stir the pasta frequently and dont wander off (Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia, or spaghetti loves company) and dont overcook it, adding olive oil to the water to stop it sticking is totally unnecessary.|`|yNv2Pazxaa	I think when I was a collage in 2018    but,    I learn to cook last year when my tita cook Halayang Ube.

0maJCeLCaa	The colour is named after the fruit.     The original fruit, the bitter orange (pomerans to some - the peel is sugar-preserved, sometimes dried, and used in desserts and cakes) is called Citrus aurantium in latin .. the word orange derives from the "aurantium"-part.    To follow the example of the orange, bananas would still be bananas, but the colour yellow might be musey in stead (from the latin name for banana).|`|aZXnW6AUaa	color named after it|`|AA11123061	the color is named after the fruit .|`|Z0nooDxDaa	thats a good question, but i guess we will never know.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	Oh dear!

Before this was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in Old English) as geoluhread, which translates into Modern English as yellow-red.    The first recorded use of orange as a colour name in English was in 1512 in the court of King Henry VIII.

0maJCeLCaa	The teflon or non-stick coating is one of the many inventions, that came out of the space-program.   So of course it's a great invention: it's rocket science!! Does it get any better than that? ;)|`|ua61WAvIaa	Sorry, but I really disagree. I recently read about how teflon causes an unnoticeable toxic gas that kills birds, much like the canaries that were used in mines to detect carbon monoxide.   Non stick bakeware is basically a plastic resin that's heat corrosion resistant.  Few people hear about the many health problems caused by non stick coatingPlease be careful using it

SjDVMh3Uaa	Since i am not rich, I do ask how much drinks cost and if I was going to drink a chaser I would just ask the bartender. Okay maybe it will get you laughed at, people laugh at me but I don't care but you may also find that it is okay to ask questions.|`|wxcmnFEKaa	Ask for the bar menu maybe a good idea, pretending you are looking at some cocktail hehe.    Chases? I don't think you need a chaser lol! Just have that shot and give a loud "WHOO" that's it.. =P the "WHOO" is your chaser.. =P..!!    The first shot of Vodka is always hard for beginners, after the first shot, the second, third, fourth.. etc are so easy like drinking water.. =P..    Cheers,|`|zWaIjJKXaa	It's fine to ask. People ask me what drinks cost all the time -  BUT if it seems a little expensive do not make a show of disapproval -eye rolling etc looks incredibly uncool; its usually hicks, old guys or derelict types who do that. Bartenders hate it, and that does look cheap, especially if you ask what like five things cost as if you're making price comparissons in your head. Just cooly order something else without a word. (Unless your friends agree or the consensus seems to be that its way overpriced - but in any case don't act like its the bartenders fault. They don't make the prices and basically just won't like you if you fault them for it.)  Secondly - chasers - we don't do them much in australia. Soft. If you were ordering grey goose I'd hope that you weren't chasing it with dirty softdrink - its expensive vodka. Basically, if you order something cheap and unpleasant, a chaser is probably in order.  You say "[cheap liquor of choice] with a 7up chaser please mr bartender you sexy beast."  And you should get a shot with a small glass or just a dash of soda which you drink a bit of straight after the shot to get rid of the dirty taste in your mouth. That whats chasers are for.... then you have fun. yay|`|jcGnBgAPaa	you can also use a lemon. that helps as a chaser|`|9cTAi7waaa	this is the second question of yours im answering. May I ask why it matters if you live in NY?     Yea dont ask the price. Well liqours (the house) are the cheapest. if you want vodka just say vodka martini to get the well vodka. Otherwise if your upselling (using a better vodka) there is going to be an upcharge. Only like 50 cents or something.     No dont ask that way about a chaser. If youve never done shots, dont do vodka. Theyre not tasty as shots. Ask for a shot of Patron, its a tequila and goes down smooth. Most people use beer as a chaser, you look silly asking for soda. Or ask for a lemon as a chaser, they way you do it, is take the full shot then immediatly take sips of a chaser to get that strong alcohol taste out of your mouth. If your a man, use beer as a chaser.
ixNcql9iaa	THE BEST NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA      Cooking Tools:    1. Pizza stone (critical to the pizza crust texture)  2. Pizza peel (looks like a wooden pan, important in transferring the pizza to the oven  3. Thermometer (to measure water temperature)  4. Pizza cutter    2 cups all purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon olive oil  2/3 cups warm water (110F to 115F)  1 teaspoon sugar  5/8 teaspoon active dry yeast    flour  cornmeal  2 tablespoons olive oil  4 tablespoons pizza sauce  2/3 lb mozzarella cheese  1/4 lb Romano and Parmesan cheese  chopped basil  crushed red pepper  garlic powder  onion powder  oregano    1. Mix the warm water and sugar in a small bowl until blended together.    2. Add the yeast and mix well. Then wait until the top becomes foamy (about 5-10 minutes).    3. In the meantime mix the flour, salt and olive oil in large bowl.    4. Once yeast/water mixture is ready, add it to the flour mixture and stir. Continue to mix until you get a doughy mass that is smooth and elastic. If it is still sticky, add some extra flour to it (It's okay if dough is slightly sticky).    5. Form the dough mass into a ball and place in an oiled bowl (you can use oil or a cooking spray). Roll the ball in the bowl so that it is covered in oil. Cover the bowl in plastic wrap and place in a warm place; let rise for at least an hour. (I run my clothes dryer for a minute then stop it and put the bowl inside).    6. If you are planning on cooking the pizza immediately, preheat the oven to 475F and place the pizza stone inside the oven on the lowest rack. The stone should be heated in the oven for around an hour before placing the pizza. This way, your dough and your pizza stone will be ready around the same time.    1. Place dough ball on a flat (clean) floured surface.    2. Punch it down and work into a circular disc. At this point the dough should be smooth and elastic and easy to work with. If not, add a pinch full of flour and rub it on top of the dough.    3. Use your hands to spread out the dough (Don't use a rolling pin). You should work from the center and spread outwards (this ensures the center dough is thinner and keeps a thicker crust). You can also stretch the dough out by holding it on top of both fists and spreading them apart slowly.    Occasionally, flip the dough over and sprinkle a little flour on to make sure dough is not sticky. Continue to work dough until you have circular disc about 12"-14" in diameter.    4. Be sure when you have completed stretching out the dough that there are no parts of the dough that are sticky, as this will make transferring the pizza to the oven difficult.    Once ready, transfer dough to a pizza peel. The peel should be lightly covered in flour and corn meal (this will help keep the pizza from sticking to the peel).    5. Brush the pizza crust with olive oil. Then top with pizza sauce and cheeses.    6. Now add the spices over the cheese. Just add enough to lightly coat the surface with a single pass. You can add any toppings that you prefer to the pizza.    7. The pizza is now ready to be cooked. If you had your oven prepared with the pizza stone at 475F for an hour, you are ready to go.    Using the pizza peel, slide the pizza on top of the stone. This can be tricky. Have the peel inside the oven at about a 20 degree angle. Then push the peel forward and jerk backwards. The pizza should slide right in like this.    8. Cook for 14 minutes and then remove only the pizza (use a pair of spatulas to remove the pizza). Let the stone remain in the oven and allow it to cool inside the oven.    9. Let the pizza cool for about 7 minutes before serving. Use a pizza cutter and make 8 slices.    Serves 2-4 people.    To clean the pizza stone:    Once it is cooled, use a metal spatula to scrape off any residue and use a wet paper towel to wipe off.    Don't use any soaps or detergents, the stone will absorb the chemicals and possibly affect the taste of the pizza. Stone will stain brown and is normal.|`|VrzX3mWsaa	Ingredients  ? 1kg strong white bread flour or Tipo 00 flour  or 800g strong white bread flour or Tipo 00 flour, plus 200g finely ground semolina flour  ? 1 level tablespoon fine sea salt  ? 2 x 7g sachets of dried yeast  ? 1 tablespoon golden caster sugar  ? 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  ? 650ml lukewarm water     pizza dough   This is a fantastic, reliable, everyday pizza dough, which can also be used to make bread. Its best made with Italian Tipo 00 flour, which is finer ground than normal flour, and it will give your dough an incredible super-smooth texture. Look for it in Italian delis and good supermarkets. If using white bread flour instead, make sure its a strong one thats high in gluten, as this will transform into a lovely, elastic dough, which is what you want. Mix in some semolina flour for a bit of colour and flavour if you like.     Sieve the flour/s and salt on to a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into the water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and when it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean, flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough.    Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about an hour until the dough has doubled in size.     Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands  this is called knocking back the dough. You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straight away, divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas  this amount of dough is enough to make about six to eight medium pizzas.    Timing-wise, its a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Dont roll them out and leave them hanging around for a few hours, though  if you are working in advance like this its better to leave your dough, covered with clingfilm, in the fridge. However, if you want to get them rolled out so theres one less thing to do when your guests are round, simply roll the dough out into rough circles, about 0.5cm thick, and place them on slightly larger pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted tinfoil. You can then stack the pizzas, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge.  --------------------------------------...  you can also watch videos on this link:    http://uk.youtube.com/results?search_typ...|`|889bdf746f8db41a658d481702371e15aa	Pizza Dough for Thin Crust Pizza           Ingredients  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (may substitute whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose)   1 (1/4 ounce) package active dry yeast   1/4 teaspoon salt   1 cup warm water   1/2-1 tablespoon olive oil   cornmeal, for sprinkling     Directions  1 Mix a little sugar into the warm water.     2 Sprinkle yeast on top.     3 Wait for 10 minutes or until it gets all foamy.     4 Pour into a large bowl  .   5 Add flour, salt, olive oil.     6 Combine.     7 Knead for 6-8 minutes until you have a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (add a bit more flour if you need to).     8 Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes.     9Lightly grease two 12-inch pizza pans.     10 Sprinkle with a little bit of cornmeal.     11 Divide dough in half.     12 Place each half on a pizza pan and pat it with your fingers until it stretches over the whole pan.     13 Try to make it thicker around the edge.     14 If desired, pre-bake at 425 F for 10 minutes (I don't always do this).     15 Then spread with pizza sauce and use the toppings of your choice.     16 Bake at 425 F for 10-20 minutes longer or until bubbly and hot.     Makes 2 12-inch pizzas.       If you don't want to use all the dough, you can freeze it.   Take a portion of dough, form into a ball, rub olive oil over it and place it in a freezer bag (the oil makes it easier to take out of the bag).   When you want to make a pizza, take dough out of freezer and allow to thaw before using.

The only thing I'm aware of that commonly occurs in crisps that could be chemically addictive is monosodium glutamate, a flavour enhancer (it makes flavours in food taste more strongly, so the manufacturers don't have to use so much): in particular, it brings out the salty taste in foods like crisps. However, MSG is only very mildly addictive and in order to develop a chemical addiction to it, you'd probably have to be eating a huge amount of crisps with it in - check the ingredients to see if this applies to Quavers.

AA10039768	Ampliando lo que dicen Espectro y lamoretas:    Las cocinas del mundo se clasifican por su autenticidad que en este caso se refiere a los ingredientes autctonos utilizados y a las preparaciones, su sabor, su variedad y su presentacin.    En base a estos detalles, la primera cocina del mundo es la China, seguida por la Francesa y terciada por la Peruana:    Aunque la cocina Peruana utiliza ingredientes del viejo mundo, muchos de sus deliciosos platos solo se pueden hacer en el Per. El olluquito con charqui por ejemplo necesita de ollucos y carne de llama salada, la carapulcra requiere de una variedad de papa especfica puesta sobre el tejado durante una noche para que la helada la convierta en peque?as piedritas duras de papa y as una gran cantidad de ejemplos mas (yaugcdem). La preparacin de los platos es muy sui generis en muchos casos: el cebiche implica pescados y mariscos cocinados en zumo de limn,  la pachamanca exige cocinar diversas carnes tubrculos y verduras en un hueco cavado en tierra y utilizando piedras calcinadas yaugcdem. Adems de ello se utilizan especies animales y vegetales que en otras latitudes son impensables: el cuy (conejillo de Indias), el erizo de mar, el corazn, cerebro y dems interioridades de la vaca, la harina del camote yaugcdem.    El sabor de la comida Peruana es clebre ya que las combinaciones de elementos son hechas en sa direccin y se utilizan muchas especies, condimentos y yerbas que lo exaltan sin sobrecargarlo. Parte del porqu se explica en ingredientes frescos (no se utilizan alimentos congelados),  y al ser los platos provenientes de costa, sierra y selva, la combinacin de sabores es realzada. Los pescados y mariscos son de un sabor nicos (solo comparables con la de ciertas partes de Espa?a) debido a una mar fra y bruta.    Su variedad es inagotable debido a la riqueza natural del pas en tres diferentes regiones y a la inventiva del Peruano en este respecto: el cebiche tambin lo hace de pato, las papas las rellena, cuando no hay camarn para la ocopa usa muy-muy yaugcdem.    La presentacin es atractiva, conjugndose colores con texturas en una vista agradable. Un simple aj de gallina es presentado as: la textura cremosa y amarilla de la salsa es puesta sobre cama de papas sancochadas cortadas a lo largo: reluciente y contrastante aceituna negra encima teniendo como vecino al huevo duro cortado a lo largo mientras que verde y crujiente hoja de lechuga a un costado sella la vistosa entrada.    Se trata de una cocina suculenta que consiste de 2 a 4 platos diferentes: entrada, sopa, segundo y postre.    Estos ltimos son tan variados e incontables como la cocina Peruana misma y  en lo relativo a las bebidas espirituosas, el Per cuenta con un cctel que se pasea por el mundo: el pisco sour, sin dejar de lado a los excelentes vinos blancos y rojos con que cuenta. Para los abstemios, cristianos verdaderos y alcohfobos, la deliciosa INKA KOLA es un refresco que no se consigue en ninguna otra parte, excepto en el Ecuador y en partes de USA donde se produce y exporta respectivamente.    Donde hay buena cocina hay tradicin de hombres al fogn. Efectivamente, tanto la cocina China como la Francesa y la Peruana se destacan porque los hombres se involucran en ellas como Chefs o cocineros domingueros (caso Peruano).    Finalmente los Peruanos, acostumbrados a apreciar lo bueno gastronmicamente hablando, son curiosos y saboreadores de las cocinas de otros pases: China, Japonesa, Italiana, etc|`|AA10468617	Tienen una muy buena variedad de mariscos, el cebiche es delicioso|`|5ac566b4cc38b51072087cf85757221daa	Hay varias cocinas internacionales que destacan sobre todas las dems en variedad: Entre las mejores est la cocina peruana y la china.|`|90e0e71551f6466ce3b0895205ae1f9aaa	La cocina peruana es una de las mas diversas puesto que tenemos todos los climas del planeta y por lo tanto tambien tenemos una variedad asombrosa de ingredientes de primera calidad donde la frescura es lo mas importante.

Generally speaking, if you can't pronounce the ingrediants ~they might not be so healthy.  When dealing with bad breath, would you rather treat the cause or the symptoms?  If you mask your breath with this product rather than flossing, rinsing and brushing, then that is not good.   Approved by the FDA? ~ that does not mean it is healthy for you.

0799caf29c3da87ebe48876754946fa0aa	Harvesting & Handling Sunflowers  Sunflowers growing in the backyard are easy to harvest and roast for a tasty treat. Sunflowers should be allowed to mature in the garden. There are several indicators of maturity. The back of the flower head will be brown and dry; most of the yellow petals will have dried and fallen; the seeds will be plump; and the seed coats will be black and white striped.      When the seeds are ready, but before the seeds begin to loosen and dry, cut the head off the stem leaving about one foot of stem attached. Rub the seeds out on the head by hand, dry, and store.       If birds and squirrels harvest your sunflowers before you do, you have a couple of options to discourage the critters. Cover the heads with paper sacks so the seeds are harder to retrieve. Heads may also be picked when the back turns from green to rich yellow, and then dried in a dry, protected location.      If your seeds are for the birds, store them sealed containers in a dry spot.       Sunflower seeds are good as a snack or added to favorite recipes in place of nuts. Raw mature sunflower seeds are easy to prepare at home. Cover unshelled seeds with salted water. Use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of salt per two quarts of water. Bring to a boil and simmer for two hours. Drain and dry on absorbent paper. Seeds may also be soaked overnight in a salt solution.      Roast sunflower seeds in a shallow pan at 300 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally. After removing from the oven, stir in one teaspoon of melted butter or margarine for every cup of seeds. Cool on an absorbent towel and salt to taste.      One-quarter cup of sunflower seeds is 200 calories. Sunflower seeds are high in potassium, calcium, and phosphorus.|`|2a276945ec678fa33c33038e28808efbaa	soak in a very strong salt brine and soak them in it.  then place on a sheet pan and let dry i usually lay them on paper towels ist on sheet pan.......|`|AA10140002	TO ROAST SUNFLOWER SEEDS:  Spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet, and toast them in a 350 degree F oven for about 10 minutes.

c449047eba652df69168853774e40c8baa	Gelato is Italys version of ice cream, with 3 major differences.     1.  gelato has significantly less butterfat than ice cream's typical 18 and 26 percent. Gelato usually has less than 10 percent butterfat. With the lower butterfat content, gelato is less solidly frozen than ice cream and melts in the mouth faster.Therefore, you taste gelatos full flavor immediately.    2. gelato has a much higher density than ice cream. Ice cream is produced by mixing cream, milk and sugar, then adding air. Manufacturers add air to ice cream because it nearly doubles the quantity of their product. But, it cuts their quality in half. No air is added to gelato. The result is a higher quality dessert with a richer, creamier taste.    3. gelato is served slightly warmer than ice cream. gelato is served 10 to 15 degrees warmer than ice cream. Because it is less solidly frozen, gelatos taste is further enhanced as it melts in the mouth.    And, gelato does have cream in it.|`|AA11588385	Gelato uses frozen Milk, not cream.|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	To be called ice cream it must contain 9% butter fat.

The same word is commonly used in English speaking countries to refer to "ice cream" that is prepared in the Italian way. "Gelato" comes from the Italian word gelare, meaning "to freeze."    The gelato ingredients (after an optional pasteurization) are super-cooled while stirring to break up ice crystals as they form. Like high end ice cream, gelato generally has less than 35% air - resulting in a dense and extremely flavoursome product.|`|2eba27b58ae67f7f343246e3b9820adfaa	Gelato is Italian. It's fabulously sinful and worth  every calorie. It has more calories than regular ice  cream- I don't think they use cream. It tastes more  like smooooooth sherbert- but rich.

AA12046853	Meat Dishes and Recipes    Fantastic Stir Fry Recipe    If not Vegetarian add about ? a pound of flank steak sliced into thin morsels that you marinate for a while in soy sauce or 1-2 chicken breasts also cut in cubes and let marinate in soy sauce    1 teaspoon of sesame oil or sunflower oil     1 yellow onion  (chopped in large pieces)   3 cloves of garlic  (minced)   I head of Broccoli     Snow Peas     2 Carrots cut in small pieces   1 package of bean sprouts     Mushrooms  (White, cremini, oyster, shitake whatever is your fancy)   1 teaspoon of black bean sauce     2-3 tablespoon of Soya sauce     You can add any other vegetable to your liking (Peppers, eggplant)     cooked over either a bed of rice or Chinese noodles       Add the oil to your wok or pan, raise the burner to high heat and add the garlic onions carrots and broccoli.   With a wooden spatula continuously stir so as to not let the vegetables burn.   Add the 1 teaspoon of black bean sauce   Lower the heat to medium   If you are making a beef or chicken stir fry, add the meat with the sauce it has been marinating in.   If you are using mushrooms, snowpeas or peppers add them at this point. It takes longer for Broccoli and carrots to cook through than mushrooms and peppers and you dont want any of your veggies to be soggy   Once you see all is cooking well add your soy sauce and bean sprouts- it takes very little time to cook those suckers.   Once you see that they have wilted, your stirfry is cooked   Serve it either on top of a bed of rice or if you are making noodles (rice or egg noodles) have them pre cooked ahead of time and add them to your wok and toss everything together.        Marinated Chicken Breast    Sick and tired of plain chicken breasts - too boring and bland- Here are a few marinade recipes that are real easy and will spice them up.    Honey Balsamic Recipe    2 tablespoons of honey    1 tablespoon of Balsamic vinegar   1 teaspoon of oil   juice of half a lemon   1 clove of garlic (minced)   ? teaspoon salt     In a bowl mix all these ingredients together and add your chicken- Marinate the full breasts or cubes (if you decide to cut them) for at least an hour- preferably longer-   Cook them in a skillet with the remainder of the marinade- it will create a thick tasty sauce to accompany your chicken   White wine/lemon marinade recipe    Juice of half a lemon    ? cup of white wine  (preferably dry)   1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard    1 clove of garlic  (minced)   1 teaspoon of oil    oregano and thyme    salt and pepper      Combine all of your ingredients together and add your chicken (full breast or diced). Let marinate for at least an hour. Heat your skillet and cook chicken at high heat until the outside is brown and lower the heat so the insides cook. Add the remaining marinade so as to create a sauce for your dish.   If you want to thicken your sauce- you can add some cream to your sauce at the last minute. Whisk it in (about 3-4 tablespoons) and bring to a boil and then simmer for a couple of minutes. Gives a great taste.   You can serve this with rice or any veggie.   Lemon Ginger Chicken Recipe    2 chicken breasts  cut in cubes or thin strips   Juice of a lemon  ? cup   1 ? teaspoon of Ginger  minced   2 cloves of garlic  minced   1 teaspoon of oil     1 tablespoon of brown sugar  ( or as much as you want to get the desired sweetness- usually between ? to 1 tablespoon is right)   ?-1 teaspoon of cornstarch       Cook the chicken in a skillet with a little oil. When chicken is almost cooked remove it from the skillet. Add the ginger and garlic and saut until lightly brown. Add the lemon juice and the brown sugar and mix well. Let boil.   In a little water dilute the cornstarch so that it does not clump. Add this mixture to the skillet. Add the chicken and stir until the sauce thickens to the desired consistency. If you see it is still too liquidy add some more cornstarch.   Serve over a bed of rice   Serves 2-3 people   You can actually prepare the same recipe but substitute orange juice for the lemon juice. If you decide to do this do not add the brown sugar because the orange juice is already naturally sweetened.   Greek Roasted Chicken Recipe    This dish is not only fabulous to eat, the smell is overwhelming and really creates much salivation to your awaiting tastebuds. This recipe is so easy and such a treat. The only patience you need is 1 ? to cook. Preparation time is minimal and you usually make enough to last 3 meals. The beauty of this dish is the more you reheat it, the more succulent it is. Here goes    3 chicken legs  (Leave the skin on)   3 chicken thighs  (Leave the skin on)   8-10 small white potatoes      2 large red tomatoes     3-4 cloves of garlic     1 lemon     2 tablespoons of olive oil or sunflower oil     thyme      salt and pepper        Peel your potatoes and cut in small chunks.   Dice your tomatoes and mince your garlic.   Mix all of these ingredients together and squeeze half a lemon on them.   Add a tablespoon of oil, salt and pepper and thyme.   In another bowl you are going to marinate your chicken with the other half of lemon (you can only use ? of a lemon if you wish) the other tablespoon of oil, salt and pepper and thyme.   You want to have both your vegetables and chicken marinating for an hours time so as to absorb all the lemon juice.

It takes 30 minutes to an hour to make it.  It's one of the most flexible dishes you can make because you can put all sorts of things into it.  From the source below, look for the Rachel Ray's 30 minute cooking, or Paula's Home Cooking shows and type in "meatloaf" in the search engine, you'll get a few great recipes.    When I make meatloaf, I usually make a salad as a side dish; fresh green lettuce, cucumbers- diced, tomatoes- diced, avocado- diced, cilantro- chopped, one stem of green onion- chopped, one boiled egg- sliced.  I use the boiled eggs' yoke to make my own dressing, or you can use ranch dressing.  My homemade dressing consists of minced garlic, soy sauce or fish sauce- whichever one is fine, olive oil, salt and pepper, and lime/lemon juice- either one is good.  mix them all into a bowl, smash in the boiled eggs' yoke and right before you eat, dress your salad.  If you're just prepping until you eat later, I suggest you put it into the fridge to cool.|`|AA11154560	Special Pork Chops  Submitted by: PaulaAnn18  Category: Pork Cutlets, Chops & Roasts  Rating:    Total Time: 1 hr 10 min  Makes: 6 servings        Ingredients:  6 pork chops  2/3 cup brown sugar  1 teaspoon paprika  1 teaspoon sage  1 teaspoon dry mustard  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon pepper  1-1/2 tablespoons cold water    Preparation:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

dbe2eb2f4bce5ba413cf891959ba7115aa	Ingredients:  1/2 cup white glue   6 Tbsp. water   Food coloring   1-4 tsp. Borax   1-4 Tbsp. water       Directions:  Mix the glue, 6 tablespoons water and food coloring until it is dissolved.     In a separate bowl, dissolve 1 teaspoon borax into 1 tablespoon water. Add to the glue solution. You will get a very thick clump of slime when the two mix. Pull the clump of slime out of the glue mixture and put it in a separate bowl.     Mix another batch of the borax solution and add to the remaining glue mixture. Repeat until all the glue mixture is used (about 3-4 times).     With clean hands, knead the slime to mix. This will take about 10 minutes and is not very difficult as the slime easily separates between your fingers.     If a looser, more slimy texture is desired knead in a bit more water. The more water you add, the slimier it gets.     The slime doesn't leave a residue and doesn't get stuck on anything.     Store in an airtight container. This can easily be doubled, tripled or quadrupled.

aa922f10521f34ddffccf3f9cc482293aa	Alcohol and drugs are temporary solutions to life's problem. Drugs and alcohol are the easy way out. What people don't realize is that escaping or running away from problems only makes things worse, and the problem only continues to grow. The only real solution is to face the problem dead on, and deal with the things in life that may cause some distress. It's true that some problems are too great to deal with, and that the problem may actually get alot worse before it gets alot better, if at all, so people instead ignore it and hope it goes away. But it eats at them inside, so they try to numb the feeling with drugs and alcohol, but you only end up ruining your life. If poverty is your problem, the difficult thing to do is get a degree and get a good job. The easy thing to do is smoke and drink and convert your mind into thinking poverty isn't so bad. If depression is your problem, then drugs may be the substance in life that keeps you happy. But for how long? Yes, it's true that in the beginning drugs are fun. They speed the dopamine levels in your brain which causes a euphoric feeling. But it overworks those chemicals in your mind, and alot of it burns out and dies, so eventually you have a lowered dopamine level, and it is harder to feel joy. So in the end the drugs just made things worse. There are many other problems, and many other "reasons" to escape reality and enter a dimension of drugs and alcohol, but none will ever be solved through substance abuse. Only the strong one can deal with the problem head on and find the solution. Drugs and alcohol are not the answer my friend. But they sure as hell are fun :)|`|0798cb01fe7cf89bfa47360ff18c6962aa	Because Bush is still in office.|`|AA10608180	it's not the answer, it's just a response.  it's a way to dull the pain, to separate the user from reality for a short time, but it doesn't answer or solve anything.  people turn to drugs or alcohol when they have nothing else to turn to (or at least think they don't), or they don't know how to or don't want to cope with their problems.  it's an easy way out, faster and less painful (in the short term) than actually confronting problems and dealing with them.|`|5dbb8806a579328ddb81f849489d6534aa	It takes people away from a reality they can't handle at that point in time.

But that said, till you're in the position of someone who has chosen to choose substance abuse as their panacea, don't judge.  In fact, if you are a recovering substance abuser, don't judge either.      The main reason so many turn to substances is because of how readily available they are.  But substances aren't the only problem addictions that exist - think about those who gamble as a way to cope or escape, others steal, committ crimes against others including murder.    So be aware of making such a quick and hasty judgement of people who do choose alcohol or drugs as their answer...

Chefs Incredible Tip: After you thoroughly wash and rinse the sausage casings, soak them in pineapple juice for 24-36 hours (in the fridge) and then rinse them again prior to stuffing them. This process softens the casings and makes them much more tender and palatable!   1/2  lb ground lean pork    1/2  lb lean ground veal or lamb    6  ounces suet     fresh breadcrumbs, made from 3 slices of white bread,including crust    1  teaspoon seasoning salt    1/2  teaspoon lemon pepper    1/2  teaspoon black pepper    1/4  teaspoon cayenne pepper    1/4  teaspoon grated nutmeg    1/8  teaspoon mace    1/8  teaspoon dried thyme    1/8  teaspoon dried marjoram    2  teaspoons dried sage    2  teaspoons onion powder    1  teaspoon finely grated lemons, rind of    1  large egg     prepared hog casings (can't get sausage casings, shape the sausage mixture into patties instead of link sausages) (optional)      8-12 servings 2 pounds Change size or US/metric   Change to:  pounds US Metric       55 minutes 45 mins prep      Knead together the pork, veal, fat, and bread.   Stir the salt, pepper, cayenne, nutmeg, mace, thyme, marjoram, sage, onion powder and lemon peel into the egg, and then knead into the meat mixture.   CHEF'S NOTE: At this point, I fry a small sausage patty and taste it so that I can adjust the seasonings, because the recipe so far is fairly mild.   Firmly stuff the mixture into the prepared hog (sausage) casings.   Prick any air pockets with a pin.   Poach, broil, grill, or fry them before serving.   Serve the bangers, drowned in nice thick onion and mushroom gravy, with a heap of mashed potatoes.   The raw sausages can be refrigerated for 3 days, cooked sausages for 1 week.   They can also be frozen (raw, poached, or broiled) for 3 months.|`|e39d316460b0b7858392bbfeed62b152aa	Bangers and Mash:  INGREDIENTS:  8 large baking potatoes, peeled and quartered   2 teaspoons butter, divided   1/2 cup milk, or as needed   salt and pepper to taste   1 1/2 pounds beef sausage   1/2 cup diced onion   1 (.75 ounce) package dry brown gravy mix   1 cup water, or as needed     --------------------------------------...    DIRECTIONS:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place potatoes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, and mash with 1 teaspoon of butter, and enough milk to reach your desired creaminess. Continue mashing, or beat with an electric mixer, until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.   In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until heated through. Remove from pan, and set aside. Add remaining teaspoon of butter to the skillet, and fry the onions over medium heat until tender. Mix gravy mix and water as directed on the package, and add to the skillet with the onions. Simmer, stirring constantly, to form a thick gravy.   Pour half of the gravy into a square casserole dish so that is coats the bottom. Place sausages in a layer over the gravy (you can butterfly the sausages if you wish). Pour remaining gravy over them, then top with mashed potatoes.   Bake uncovered for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until potatoes are evenly brown.

Halloween  nel solco della tradizione sipontina   La tradizione sipontina, ormai scomparsa, di commemorare i defunti  simile alla festa di Halloween.   di Nicola Riccardi  --------------------------------------...      --------------------------------------...     Tra pochi giorni cade la ricorrenza di Ognissanti e sembra quasi che non esista pi. I media italiani danno la sgradevole sensazione che sia stata sostituita dalla festa di Halloween.    Ci siamo chiesti se il modo di celebrare questa solennit di origine anglosassone, anche se i media fanno riferimento specificatamente a quella americana,  molto distante dalla tradizione sipontina di commemorare i defunti.    Secondo la credenza popolare sipontina e garganica, la notte tra il 1 e il 2 novembre,  l'unica occasione che Dio offra alle anime dei morti di ritornare sulla terra per far visita ai parenti.     In ogni paese tutte le anime dei morti, vestite di bianco e con una lanterna in mano, si riuniscono tutte insieme e girano, fino all'alba, in processione per le strade cantando litanie e pregando. Durante la processione di tanto in tanto alcune anime si staccano dal corteo ed entrano nelle case.    Ogni famiglia, prima di coricarsi, ha apparecchiato la tavola con una tovaglia bianca, del pane, un coltello, per tagliare il pane, una palma benedetta posta su un bicchiere contenente acqua santa e una lucerna, realizzata con acqua in cui galleggiava l'olio d'oliva in cui veniva posto uno stoppino, per rischiarare la stanza.    I bambini sono stati messi a letto con la speranza di ottenere i doni che le anime dei morti lasciano durante la visita. Naturalmente non prima di aver collocato la propria calza, necessaria per contenere i doni, in un posto ben visibile: sulla porta dell'uscio, sul caminetto o altrove.    Il pomeriggio di Ognissanti i ragazzi, in gruppetti, bussavano alle porte di parenti, conoscenti ed estranei e chiedevano "l'aneme de li murte", ovviamente con poche speranze di successo. Dopo un breve scambio di convenevoli proferivano "e damme nu fiche, e damme nu fiche". Al termine del giro tornavano a casa con tante cose buone: dolciumi, frutta, caramelle ed altro.    Il giorno successivo erano i poveri del paese a fare il giro porta porta con la speranza di racimolare qualcosa per sfamarsi.    Queste tradizioni sono del tutto scomparse. Ci che vive ancora  la calza dei morti e la visita ai parenti pi stretti, di norma i nonni, per ricevere qualche regalino, ma senza la connotazione tradizionale.    A ben vedere, la festa di Halloween, con il suo girare per le case, dal punto di vista sostanziale,  nel solco della tradizione sipontina e garganica. Le differenze esteriori, - travestimento, scherzetto e zucca illuminata -, che di primo acchito sembrano lontane dalla nostra tradizione ad un analisi pi attenta non lo sono.    Il travestimento e lo scherzetto, basti pensare al nostro carnevale, appartengono di diritto alla tradizione sipontina. La zucca illuminata  il lumino che ogni famiglia metteva sulla tavola per rischiarere la stanza.    Ben venga, quindi, la festa di Halloween che permette un ritorno alla vecchia tradizione sipontina, ormai scomparsa, di girare casa per casa. Per il sipontino la festa di Halloween , certamente, la sintesi perfetta tra il sacro, la commemorazione dei defunti, e il profano, il carnevale.|`|fd90be6d060cb7d64ac5d72241ee9db1aa	io la faccio al mio fidanzato che  foggiano,  un usanza tipica di quelle zone.... io sono di como e da noi la calza si fa alla befana!|`|a5efd5dbbb4c45d0039be682f41aa244aa	grazie non la sapevo neach'io e visto che ho un bimbo di un mese e mezzo non manchero di fargli trovare questa calza piena di dolci  grazie mille a me piacciono tantissimo queste tradizioni  ps grazie anche da parte del mio piccolo Andrea|`|5f32fa08c5797a34bd1fd20961437bbdaa	mai sentita cosa simile|`|6009c3a025ebb508e280029ec6778686aa	No in Puglia non c' questa usanza, perlomeno a Bari.

It explained how you could go to a steakhouse and get a steak that has been "aged" for a few weeks.  It involves not freezing them but keeping them under a cover with ventilation and then in the preparation you remove the outside leathery areas before cooking.  See the website or his books for more info but it sounded like it was a pretty good way to not freeze the steaks and make them come out better.|`|6b4f84b8f4bff0407ad563bf7db913d7aa	Don't overcook it - the longer you cook it,  the tougher it gets.  After it's cooked let the steak rest on a warm plate for 5 minutes for the meat to relax.  Don't worry - it won't go cold in that time.|`|46973fe62db90e77ca1d560382685772aa	Lemme see, there are a number of things that could be causing your chewy problem. It is probably not the freezing. Freezing tends to break the structure of the meat down rather than making it tough. We use a vacuum sealer to package the meat before freezing to keep it as fresh as possible. My husband is a serious beef fanatic and is very opinionated about steak. Here's a couple of points from him that seem to do the trick.    All meat is not the same. Depending on which store or butcher you buy your meat from, you can get meat which is of varying quality. Even though you may buy the same cuts from several different places, some stores sell meats have little or no taste, while others are tender and very flavorful. Try buying in several different stores and keep track of your results. Once you have found a store that has good quality (flavor, tenderness and price) buy your meats there, Costco is the store I have the best luck with. They have very good quality in thier products.If you have a local butcher you can usually get some nice cuts of good quality but it tends to be a little pricey.              How you prepare it has a lot to do with the texture of the meat as well. My husband (serious cook) says "not to screw up a nice piece of meat by overcooking it". He adds that the steak should be quickly seared on high heat. It has to be grilled or cooked in a very lightly oiled cast iron skillet. And it has to be coated with a rub, we use montreal or pepper and sea salt. Then the steak has to rest (If he liked steak anymore he would give it a trip to a spa) My husband likes his steak with, garlic, saute'd yellow onions and portabello mushrooms. Whatever you do, don't leave it in the pan or on the grill too long, it destroys the flavor and dries out the meat.     Lastly, after you have prepared it, let it sit for a few minutes, to rest again.

e8f83d4549217daf971adf65fb77d1e7aa	Sun Dried Tomatoes    *Note that there is a lot of shrinkage in this process. Someone recently  posted that it takes 15-20 pounds of tomatoes to make 1 pound of dried tomatoes. This is part of the reason they are so expensive. The best tomato to use in this process is the Roma tomato (also known as a plum, pear, or Italian tomato), because it contains less water and seeds than other varieties. Howev cut in half if small, quarters omato, even cherry tomatoes. They will just take a little longer to dry and yield a little less product.     Dried Tomatoes (yields about 1 pint)   Wash carefully and wipe dry:  7 or 8 pounds of firm, ripe (preferably Roma) tomatoes.   Cut out the stem, and if the tomato has a scar (discolored area of tough skin), remove it and the hardened core lying under it.   Cut the tomatoes in half, lengthwise. If the tomato is more than about 2 inches long, cut it in quarters.     Scrape out all of the seeds that you can without removing the pulp.     Arrange the tomatoes, with the cut surface up, on non-stick cookie sheets (glass or porcelain dishes are OK. They will have to withstand temperatures of a few hundred degrees F if you are going to oven-dry the tomatoes).     Do *not* use aluminum foil, or bare aluminum cookie sheets. The  acid in the tomatoes will react with the metal.     Mix together thoroughly:  1 tsp dried basil  1 tsp dried oregano  1 tsp dried thyme  2 tsp salt.  Sprinkle a small amount of this mixture on each tomato. (You may customize this mixture to suit your own taste.)   Dry the tomatoes in the oven, dehydrator, or in the sun.   Directions follow for each of these methods. However, no matter what method you choose, be aware that not all of the tomatoes will dry at the same rate. They do not all have the same amount of moisture, nor do they experience the same temperature and air circulation while they are drying.     They are done when they are very dry, but still pliable - about the  texture of a dried apricot. If dried too long, they become tough and  leathery. If not dried long enough, they will mold and mildew, unless packed in oil. So watch them carefully while they dry. Try to remove them on an individual basis, before they become tough.     Here are the drying methods. There is a time listed with each method. This time is approximate, and can vary significantly depending on the moisture of the tomato. Do not rely on this time as more than a very rough guide.     Oven-drying (approximately 12 hours):   Bake, cut side up, in 170 F oven for about 3 hours. Leave the oven door propped open about 3 inches to allow moisture to escape. After 3 hours, turn the tomatoes over and press flat with your hand or a spatula. Continue to dry, turning the tomatoes every few hours, and gently pressing flatter and flatter, until tomatoes are dry.     Dehydrator method (approximately 8 hours):   Place the tomatoes, cut side up, directly onto the dehydrator trays. Set dehydrator temperature to about 140 F. After 4 or 5 hours, turn the tomatoes over and press flat with your hand or a spatula. After a few hours, turn the tomatoes again and flatten gently. Continue drying until done.     Sun-drying (approximately 3 days):   Dry in hot weather, with relatively low humidity.   Place tomatoes, cut side down, in shallow wood-framed trays with nylon netting for the bottom of the trays. Cover trays with protective netting (or cheesecloth). Place in direct sun, raised from the ground on blocks or anything else that allows air to circulate under the trays. Turn the tomatoes over after about 1 1/2 days, to expose the cut side to the sun. Place the trays in a sheltered spot after sundown, or if the weather turns bad.   After the tomatoes are dry, store in air-tight containers, or pack in oil.     To pack in oil:  Dip each tomato into a small dish of white wine vinegar. Shake off the excess vinegar and pack them in olive oil. Make sure they are completely immersed in the oil. When the jar is full, cap it tightly and store at *cool* room temperature for at least a month before using. They may be stored in the refrigerator. but the oil will solidify at refrigerator temperatures (it quickly reliquifies at room temperature however).  As tomatoes are removed from the jar, add more olive oil as necessary to keep the remaining tomatoes covered.     The author notes that she has stored oil-packed tomatoes in her pantry for over a year with tremendous success. She also notes that she has tried a number of methods to pack the tomatoes in oil, but she says the vinegar treatment is the difference between a good dried tomato and a great one. It is also important from a food safety standpoint, as it acidifies the oil and discourages growth of bacteria and mold.     ****** WARNING ********   Do *NOT* add fresh garlic cloves to oil-packed dried tomatoes, UNLESS you store them in the refrigerator. Garlic is a low-acid food which, when placed in oil, creates a low-acid anaerobic environment - the perfect growth medium for botulinum bacteria if the mixture is not refrigerated. Botulism poisoning is characterized by a very high mortality rate. Be safe and add your garlic to the dried tomatoes as part of the recipe for them *after* they come out of the oil.     Now that we have a pint of sun-dried tomatoes, what do we do with them? Their chewiness makes them somewhat unwieldy, unless sliced or chopped. The author offers the following recipe, which is "Rich, dark, and pungent, ... a heavenly concoction".     Essence of Sun-Dried Tomatoes   1 C (moderately packed) sun-dried tomatoes (if oil-packed, drain and  reserve the oil)  2 cloves garlic, peeled  2 tsp drained capers  1 Tbl coarsely chopped fresh basil (or 1 1/2 tsp dried) 1 1/2 Tbl olive  oil (use reserved o|`|AA10289366	INGREDIENTS        * 4 pounds tomatoes      * salt to taste    DIRECTIONS       1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).     2. Wash and halve tomatoes. Gently squeeze out the seeds. Place the tomatoes on a non-stick cookie sheet, and sprinkle with salt to taste.     3. Bake until tomatoes take on a leathery texture. This could literally take all day; smaller pieces will require less oven time.|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	I made them, from plum tomatoes that i grew.  Slice them about 1/8 th inch thick and place on a sheet tray and into a 180 degree oven, very low heat.  It will take 6-10 hours to dry them out.  You can use them in salads, sauces, garnishes ect.  you can pour olive oil over them and enjoy them with a good piece of french or italian bread as an appetizer.

In India, try Dindori Reserve (its a decent Shiraz from India's Sula vineyards). And if you visit Indonesia, you should taste the award-winning semi-sweet wine Pino de Bali. If you go to Thailand, try Siam Winery's Chatemp. And in Japan, the best for me is Katsunuma-  Chateau Mercian      Enjoy!|`|AA11847233	I can't say it is honest-to-goodness type good but, one brand of from Asia (Beijing, China) that is avail in the U.S. is Dragon Seal.  The wines are available in noble grape varieties like Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot, etc.      They are inexpensive (generally under $10 per bottle retail).  To find out more visit www.dragonsealusa.com.  I have tried a few and they are not my favorite wines but I have clients who enjoy them.      There is also plum wine.  Gekkikahn makes two plum wines and they are sold all over the U.S..  The plums are hand picked and aged for approximately three years to bring it to the peak of maturity.  I like to drink them at the end of a meal instead of dessert or I share them with guests who generally don't care for wines.  They are very sweet.  One of their wines is heavier than the other (Plum Gekkeikan).    I'm not sure where you live but, if you have a Whole Foods Market in your area they carry several plum wines.  There is even one that have the plums floating in the bottle.    I hope this helps.|`|d7dd462aaca2f3f6864eb52dbf7754d7aa	you could look to other growing regions aside from China and Japan.

AA11847233	There are special stoppers called "champagne stoppers" that you can purchase on amazon.com, housewares stores, wine and grocery stores.  These stoppers have added rubber and grip that are designed to fit the chunky necks of Champagne-style bottles.    A good "champagne stopper" used on a high quality sparkling wine or Champagne should keep the bubbles 'alive' for four to five days.|`|434f3a2d5f4b623996e1c124b030b214aa	It's like any other carbonated beverage. Opening it will release the pressure in the bottle and allow more of the CO2 to come out of the liquid. Keeping it cold will keep more of the CO2 in the liquid. This may make it seem flat, but bring it up to room temperature and the CO2 will be released more easily and it will be more bubbly.|`|AA11981521	Nope, it loses the fizz when you open it, but you can buy these special tops to keep the fizz in!|`|77f28a9963ef80a065313fc701d3dbe8aa	It will go flat, as in less fizzy, but it will still contain the same amount of alcohol.  The CO2 will eventually evaporate, but the ethanol won't.    Flat champagne/sparkling wine doesn't taste very good, though.
