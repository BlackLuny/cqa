10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	Aviation paints are different in formulation than automotive or industrial paints. Although with some of the newer automotive paints not a lot different. Acrylic urethane and polyester urethane paints are the most commonly used options when it comes to painting aircraft. Aviation paints are produced by Pratt and Lambert, Sherwin-Williams, PRC Desoto (PPG), Akzo Nobel, and Axon. Jet Glo and Acry Glo by Sherwin-Williams, as well as Dupont. <br>  <br>  The paint for aircraft is more flexible than that used for most automobiles. The surfaces of an aircraft are subject to more flex and thus have to have paints to accommodate the flex or the paint cracks. It also needs to be capable of higher impact protection than does MOST automotive paints. (Few cars travel at 200mph).  Imron is used on many GA aircraft which is in common with automotive finishes. Even it has slightly different formulation for aircraft. <a href="http://www.mikeandjerrys.com/dImron.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mikeandjerrys.com/dImron.asp</a><br>  <br>  You also have to select the proper paint for the materials used in the aircraft. Aluminum vs Fabric vs Composites makes a difference for what paint is best.<br>  Here is a good article on aviation painting and selection.<br>  <a href="http://articles.directorym.net/Appearances_Count-a906603.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.directorym.net/Appearanc...</a><br>  <br>  As for as the chemistry used?  I have no idea what all goes into that. It is entirely possible that many of the coatings are identical in all three fields -- but I trust the companies that make paint for aviation are really customizing the bases for the use.<br>  <br>  Painting an aircraft is not cheap and should be done by those who know what to use and how. An AI/AP has to balance all control surfaces once paint has been applied (regardless of who applied the paint)  or the aircraft can be at high risk of a control failure! <br>  <br>  The value is impacted by poor paint or wrong paint being used as well. All painting has to be entered in the logs for the aircraft.|`|0jMTJjwYaa	I don't know exactly what kind, but airlines use lighter painters than normal so they can save fuel.<br>  <br>  here's the real fact: fully-painted boeing 747-400 weighs 11 tons more than unpainted 747-400..<br>  <br>  think how much the airline can save money if they don't paint the airplane...<br>  <br>    HOWEVER, the reason they have to paint the airplane is because if they don't, the metal will be messed up(weaker) much much faster.
wpgRMjgraa	A car seat belt is designed to minimise injury when the car is in a full head-on crash. If you have a full head-on crash in an aircraft . . . <br>  <br>  An aircraft seat belt is designed to minimise injury during severe turbulance (be it turbulance caused by a natural atmospheric phenomena, by aircraft performance or relatively low stability during take-off and landing). <br>  <br>  Hence the requirement is to wear a car seat belt whenever the car is in motion. But airliners are fitted with "fasten seat belt" signs as it is not required to wear them at all times that the aircraft is in motion. <br>  <br>  Clearly if fitting lap belts instead of inertia chest belts is a cost saving exercise designed to save installation costs and weight then the airlines are missing a lot of opportunities. Why go to the bother and cost of fitting the seat-belt signs when they could save that cost and weight simply with a safety instruction card that told the passengers to keep belted up at all times?<br>  <br>  Other possible cost savings they could consider would the cost and weight saving of getting rid of WCs and galleys. If passengers had to remain belted-up at all times when the aircraft was in motion they clearly could not use the WCs and serving food and drink during a flight would cause passengers significant problems. So would we need FAs? Or is their safety unimportant? After all if they and the passengers had to remain belted-up throughout the flight what would they do?<br>  <br>  Yes. It is all prertty ridiculous. But think about it. Is it any less ridiculous than suggesting airlines are putting cost savings before passenger safety by using lap belts and not inertia reel chest belts?<br>  <br>  And a final thought. You are in an airliner and wearing an inertia reel, car-type, crash (not safety) belt. The aircraft is in trouble and is going to crash land. So what do you have to do? First you release the seat belt catch. Only then can you adopt the position recommended by all airlines' safety cards in the event of a crash. So your inertia reel belt would actually be a safety hazzard as on impact you will now be thrown about the cabin.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/4219162/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums...</a>|`|S9QyF6NQaa	auto seat belts have pretensioners while airplane ones do not

Make sure they sign exactly as the title lists them and check for any erasure marks because the DMV will most likely reject it. Once you bring it back to New York, you will pay taxes, registration, and title fees. In addition, if the title is dated and you go to the DMV after 30 days, then you might be charged an additional fee.<br>  <br>  If you are going to buy from a dealer, then you will have to pay Vermont Sales Tax and assuming they are a reciprocal state, you will get an ST108 form stating the taxes you already paid on the vehicle.

AA10419188	Ok, - so you have gotten the hood open somehow! The next thing is to try to figure out what the "smoke" is, and how it smells, --- or if it is even smoke!  Your ears eyes should give you a clue here as to how bad it is, ---  generally speaking, the more noise it makes, and the worse it smokes, -- the worse it is!  Do you hear water boiling, - or see great volumes of steam blowing all over under the hood area, - look for missing belts (waterpump especially), broken hoses, leaks around top and bottom (or in some cases ends)of radiator, - these are the "water pans" that core hooks too !  If system properly filled with antifreeze mixture, - it will have a "sweetish" smell, and a taste (from tip of finger) will have a bitterish taste (spit it out as much as possible),--- don't drink a cup full, it is poison and will kill you,- or make you extremely sick anyway!<br>  <br>  Oil on the other hand has an entirely different smell, and varys between type of oil (engine trans. power steering etc)--  and even between brands.  Oil will pretty much stop within a ninute or two, - boiling water will continue boiling for quite some time!<br>  <br>  When all the noise stops, and things stops "dancing", check "fluid" levels, anything showing shortage of fluid, is probably the culprit!  Caution - if you can not touch top or radiator by radiator cap without getting burned, don't remove the cap!  If it is leaking water very badly , do not drive, - you could ruin engine!<br>  <br>  With your knowledge level, - probably better to take it somewhere, -- if it seems to not be losing a whole lot rapidly (especially water and engine oil levels), let mechanic figure it out and repair!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i raise the hood and find out where it,s coming from. it could be a oil leak or anti-freeze leak.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	you pull over and shut the car off then open the hood and see whats on fire|`|nAK8bm91aa	Smoke is one of two types here, steam from a broken radiator or hose, or there is a Fire.

4QdiXs03aa	With proper and quality maintenance, a vehicle can last for a very long time. To be honest, with the apparent quality maintenance that he did, the Suburban is probably closer to "new vehicle" reliable than most with just average maintenance.<br>  <br>  Towing always puts additional strain on the drive train, especially in hilly or mountainous areas, so I'd be more concerned on whether the transmission filter and fluid has been changed too...the addition of a transmission cooler is always a good preventive add on too.<br>  <br>  Based upon your description, I'd feel confident...|`|mwu6aJuyaa	there is never a gaurantee with an engine of that age. (or any engine really) stress can make parts break. Something that works fine one second can snap the next. With higher mileage engines your odds of something going wrong obviously increase. If your engine was well maintained which it sounds like it was, then your odds of a successful trip are perhaps improved over the same engine with the same miles that wasn't maintained as well. But that's as good as anyone is going to be able to tell you. If you feel it's a good reliable engine, your going to have to take your chances. If not, then you may want to make other plans.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	I've got one at 307,000 miles.<br>  <br>  Because I maintain it properly.<br>  <br>  Results will vary, depending on how well you maintain yours.<br>  <br>  Is it reliable to do the 1500 mile trip?

Synthetic oils protect better, keep things cleaner, preserve expensive engine guts, and more than triple engine life. Mobil One 0W grade oil, ELF or Amzoil are the only ones worth using. Forget ANYTHING else. WHen you get to 500,000 miles, contact Ripley's Believe it or Not. They might just get you a brand new engine!|`|HUluAQM3aa	I'd check the basics.<br>  Condition of the plugs and belts.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	Couple of reasons that I can think of cost being one of them. Anything, installed in an aircraft, has to have FAA certification. That is expensive and the units approved for installation are therefore also expensive. The $100 am/fm/cd that you put in your car, is about $2000 for an aircraft! So it really isn't just put one in and go. You have to get the unit, the installation, the wiring, the weight, all approved if it gets "installed". Normal "car" speakers are out as the magnets used are too big and cause compass issues so you need stereo intercom systems as well. Most pilots and owners would rather put the 2-3k into needed items not entertainment.<br>  <br>  Secondly, since many pilots are in constant communication, or near constant communication with air traffic control the entertainment is interrupted as a matter of routine.  Since the first order of business is to fly the plane the pilot doesn't need the system. A large portion of GA is not flown with anyone other than the pilot. <br>  Larger GA aircraft do usually have entertainment but most 4 to 6 place aircraft do not for these reasons.<br>  <br>  There are CD players, Ipods, and other entertainment that are in use in many GA aircraft - just plug them into the existing intercom.<br>  <br>   As the XM weather products increase, so will the use of XM radio as well.|`|FjvTSyoSaa	they r usually used 4 short trips or the crew is 2 or more people, so no need for them<br>  plus, these systems will incur weights and therefore the aircraft will be heavier, therefore more fuel, therefore more costs

2VVU7gNfaa	They probably just change the wheel position so they can fit into the car or safely move it.  Has nothing to do with any maintenance test.  As far as turning down the lights goes, I have no idea - maybe they just bump the switch/dial by accident?<br>  <br>  You might want to write down the exact mileage of your car when you drop it off next time - there's a (probably slim) chance someone is driving your car around without your permission but things are most likely just getting changed around so that the tech can fit in the car long enough to pull it into the service bay.|`|TQoM8vCZaa	i would change mechanics. they arent supposed to mess with your personal settings, unless it was hard for them to get in the seat|`|RiQA4Epraa	maybe when they sit it in to drive it in the shop, they adjust the stuff to their settings..<br>  <br>  but if your just doing an oil change, you just drive in, shouldnt need them to

Black also has to be waxed periodically to keep the shine.  I know people don't wax cars like they used to, but black is still a hard color to maintain.  I would choose silver.|`|AA10461474	Like Kimberle says, unless you are really into detailing cars, black is a difficult color to maintain. It shows every bit of dirt & water mark. Silver is much better. But, I don't recommend Silver if you live in a part of the country were there's lots of gray skies (Pacific Northwest) or fog. Your Silver 4 Runner will disappear in those conditions. I drive a small car, so I like to be seen, so mine in white (easy to keep clean, too). Another good color, might be the Driftwood Pearl.

AA11264416	this is why i'll never take anything to Walmart, there's a reason they do things cheaper, you get what you pay for, even if they did leave it off you can't get it back now, its been 6 months so im pretty sure they threw the intake system away by now, i think its too much trouble trying to get a lawyer because its no real way you could prove they're the ones that left it off because its been so long, i wish you could but it was 1 month ago so its no way you could prove they're the ones that took it off and left it off, get my point? well all you can really do is maybe try to find a whole air intake system from a junkyard or salvage yard and then buy a new filter, if you've been driving a car for 1 month without a filter then its no telling how it looks in the engine, i guess now you know not to get Walmart to do any work, all i've heard are bad stories about Walmart service centers|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	A couple things here.

dWLgwb3baa	If you work for an airline right now, you should already know this information.<br>  <br>  If you are asking about this for future reference, SSRI medications are not allowed for any class of medical certificate.  When you apply for a medical certificate, you must disclose any medications that you are taking as well as your comprehensive medical history.  You would have to check the box saying that you were diagnosed with "Mental disorders of any sort" and explain the diagnosis.<br>  <br>  If an Aviation Medical Examiner can issue a first class medical certificate or not depends on your diagnosis and how long you took the medication.  If you are still on the medication, if you have taken the medication within the last 3 months, or if you have taken the medication for longer than 6 months in the past, or if you had a diagnosis for anything other than "minor" depression, the medical issuance is based on an FAA decision.<br>  <br>  You MUST disclose your medical history.  The little box by the line you sign on your medical application states that falsification (including hiding information) can result in fines up to $250,000 and/or 5 years in prison.

QpP1xJ4Naa	This is a vanity issue more then what the car has to have!<br>  I always buy speed rated tires for my Miata cars (1990 models). I know this is a vanity issue for me, because I have no real need for 140 MPH tires, when the speed limit any place I go is never over 75 and most roads I drive are 55 or less.<br>  Some drivers believe that the reason they can not go through a turn as fast as another is because they need better tires. Which most times is not the case.<br>  I might suggest that you drop the subject, or get him into a safe place to learn what the car can do (like Solo II competitions that SSCA sponsors).|`|tBtxzmP6aa	Assuming his car has the original wheels (14x6 or 15x6) then yes you can get tires that will last longer than "performance tires".  There will be a trade off though, generally speaking tires that last longer don't have as much grip and aren't as responsive.  I suspect his car has wheels other than stock if he spent $200 for each tire though...  <br>  <br>  Without knowing what wheels he has we can only offer very general comments.  Post again with what size wheels (diameter and width) and we can offer more specific advice.  It would be very helpful to know how the car will be driven - sedately or enthusiastically?  daily driver or weekend fun?

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	Even among Lexus models, there are different generation navigation systems, so the map DVD updates are not always interchangeable.  Same for Toyota.

But, again i'm not that into toyota's or lexus's, so if toyota does have a model with touch screen navigation, chances are that it is the same one. Along goes with the non touch screen navigation.

You'll pay a small fee and they might ask her to explain her situation and proof that she was married to him or that the have divorced. Anyways, it depends.. they might not even ask you all those questions. If you have the bill of sale you can have a new title made to your name. Sometimes they won't do anything and tell you "this is the law!" B.S.! You bought that care and it's yours!<br>  In that case go to a third party agency like getnewtitle.com or other (google new car title). They might give you the title to the ex name again. In that case tell your friend to just sign it over to you. You don't have to go to the tag office or notary or whatever.

wBrPA1Dlaa	I agree, the vr6 is probably your best bet.  The g60 is a bit lighter, therefore it handles a little better.  The main drawback on the g60 is the supercharger itself.  They have a tendency to go out and are very costly to replace.  As a previous owner of a VR6 corrado a word of advice,  cost of repairs on the VR6 ain't no picnic either.  <br>  <br>  I wrecked mine a few years ago and am still kicking myself.  it was a super cool car.  I hope to get another one someday.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	The VR6 is faster if both cars are stock.  The VR6 was the newer version of the two.  The G60 might be a little easier to make faster through the aftermarket since it was supercharged from the factory (so it might be easier to add aftermarket boost to the G60's 4cyl without tearing the whole motor apart), but I'd go with the VR6 if I were choosing between the two as a daily driver.

It packs an impressively roomy rear seat, and the tall roofline allows easy access. The 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine is relatively refined, but needs to be revved to deliver power. The standard six-speed manual is a bit clunky, and a continuously variable transmission is optional. Fuel economy is good, but not a standout at 28 mpg for the CVT. The ride is relatively comfortable and quiet, but handling isn't particularly agile.

Once creosote treated ties are afire, their flames are difficult to extinguish.  Tie fires on the railroad can occur due to something as simple as carelessly discarded cigarette, and when rail grinders are working tie fires as a result of hot sparks are a daily consequence of grinding operations during clement weather.<br>  <br>  Even if the construction could get past a building inspector, every insurance agent you contact to try to get fire insurance will enjoy a much needed belly laugh... <br>  <br>  Although they make dandy fence posts and are perfect for retaining walls, they are a poor choice for dwelling or even out-building construction.

Make sure that the preamp cables are plugged in to the back of the stereo. You don't necessarily need to pull the stereo out of the dash. Just use a multimeter and check for voltage. If you have voltage, you're good. Then, check the connection at the amp. From there, check for voltage on the speaker terminals on the amp. Once again, if you have voltage, you should be good.

ys3DHzDuaa	The car is solid.  It received high ratings from frontal crash test results which means you should be fairly well protected from head to toe.  It comes standard with front, side, and even knee protection airbags.  The car is expected to get about 30 mpg on the highway and about 22 in the city.

I own a 2008 Lancer, and I can tell you this though. It has a lot of airbags. The car seems good and well built. Its computer also has restrictions like doesn't let you accelerate too fast that you might blow the engine up and it knows its limitations which is good for daily driving. The gas/mpg is good overall, but it could've been better for a 4 cylinder car though. It was rated 29-30 for the 2008 lancers and the 2009 lancer gts is rated 28. I got like 33-35 the most out of the CVT Lancers. But like I said these numbers are really low for a small economy compact car. The Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla are way much better with gas than the new Lancers. But overall, all the new model cars should be fine and crash ratings are very good.

LuqZXXyBaa	If you just have your permit you don't need to be added as a driver to your parents insurance policy; only if you have your actual drivers license, then you'll need to be added as a driver and their insurance premium will be outrageous. But you're right, you should at least get your permit.
LuqZXXyBaa	Is the title signed over to you? If not, that's your first step. Once you have the title signed over to you, go into an insurance office. Get insurance coverage... most insurance companies can bind coverage as long as the title is notarized on the back. After you've got an insurance policy get the emission test and registration and your new title.

m2AJmfIRaa	When your vehicle is sitting, extra gas vapor in the motor is collected in the evap canister. (This is like a sponge sitting outside on a wet day: it will become moist by absorbing the water vapor in the surrounding air.)<br>  <br>  The evap purge valve opens when the vehicle is at normal operating temperature, and allows the engine to suck the gasoline fumes out of the charcoal media in the evap canister, burning vapor that would have otherwise vented into the atmosphere. This process also empties the charcoal of vapor and prepares it to be able to collect more vapors. <br>  <br>  Driving the vehicle without the valve should not hurt it, as long as you plug any potential vacuum leaks. The only thing I can think of that will be affected is the environment, in a small way, because of the tiny amount of gas fumes venting into the atmosphere instead of being trapped.|`|klCh1CWAaa	I don't think so

64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	Yes there is a difference.  Running a tire of a different width than the rest is never a good idea, but the main concern would be the extra height.  The first number 225 or 245 is the width of the tire in millimeters.  The second number is the aspect ratio.  The sidewall height represented as a percentage of the tread width.  In your case a 225/35 would have a sidewall of 78.75 mm.  The 245/35 would have a sidewall of 85.75 mm.  That is a 7 mm difference.  Multiply that by two for the sidewall top and bottom and you'd have a tire that was 14 mm taller in overall diameter, over 1/2 an inch.|`|TQoM8vCZaa	Since its that small, there wouldnt be a difference. That is the width of the tire which doesnt really matter. I would be more concerned with the tread thickness bc you dont really want to be running one tire that is bigger than the others because of less wear.

EMC7JwVBaa	American builders never have built a good aluminum engine. It warps and cracks if it overheats, and engines work off heat. Some of them can't seem to even build a good iron engine. Aluminum has its characteristic of transferring a lot of heat, being light and not being very hard. Engine parts must be an alloy of aluminum to try and harden it, but expansion is still a problem. Volkswagen and Porsche made good aluminum engines. GM made a bunch of "throw away" aluminum engines- including the NORTHSTAR. Think Corvair, Olds Jetfire (they used to blow up all the time) and the Vega (P.O.S.). Toyota is making all-aluminum engines that are good for tons of troublefree miles.|`|klCh1CWAaa	if you take of it then there is no difference|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	IMO they are more likely to be effected by overheating.

It depends on how it's treated. Most vehicles with aluminum heads are either very new or higher end vehicles, or sports cars.

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	The torque converter clutch (TCC) engages when you are at cruising speed.  It basically makes both halves of the torque converter mesh together and gives you a 1 to 1 ratio.  Chances are that you will never know it is not working correctly other than the light flashing and a slight reduction in fuel economy due to the converter halves never meshing fully.  The TCC solenoid is in the valve body of the transmission, and can cause this problem, but it could also be caused by the torque converter itself, really no way to tell without going in and replacing one or the other.  It can be either, and it is really difficult to determine which is causing the problem.  Usually I replace the solenoid first because it is cheaper and less intrusive, and see if it makes the concern go away, if it doesn't, then it is in the torque converter and the tranny needs to be removed to replace the converter.  If it doesn't bother you, it can usually be driven as is, just a small reduction in fuel economy will be noted.
EMC7JwVBaa	Take the plug off the bottom of the gas tank and drain it, then look at the gas. If the car runs OK then leave it alone- except for, like somebody already said- get a locking gas cap. The kids probably took the cap off to sniff the gas and were too wasted to remember to put it back on.<br>  <br>  The gas tank has a filter on its fuel pick up. There's another filter on the other end of the fuel line and probably another one on the carburetor or throttle body. Crap has to be pretty fine and dissolved to get past all that. There are things which dissolve (not sugar) in gas that can make a mess- and I am not going to mention any of them. Or immiscible liquids which cause trouble. Those can drain out.|`|klCh1CWAaa	what kind of car is it|`|viGqMW1Xaa	there is a locking gas cap u can purchase for like $12 to prevent this in the future|`|Og3vKQeWaa	you can check the inside of a tank, with an endoscope.

PVadraNTaa	I'd return them just to be safe. Regardless of them being legal or not, the white backup lights are there to help you see what is behind you when you back your car up. They also help other drivers and pedestrians predict your movements during both the day and night, this is especially helpful in crowded parking lots and other places that reduce visibility. The red lenses will probably make others think that you are stopped, or you have your headlights on and the taillights are on, possibly causing someone to walk or pull out behind you while trying to backup. The lenses will also dim the light, reducing visibility at night and increasing the chance of you backing into something and causing damage.<br>  <br>  Think about safety and return them or exchange them for a different style. Most online stores have a return policy, unless you purchased them from an independent seller on a website like eBay. If you did, contact the seller and see what they can do.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Try these site.....white or amber but red would be illegal.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4513.13" rel="nofollow">http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4513.13</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://law.justia.com/ohio/codes/orc/jd_4513-e697.html" rel="nofollow">http://law.justia.com/ohio/codes/orc/jd_...</a>|`|MmTe8W8uaa	No, because red is the same color as brake and tail lights.

Yes, you will feel like an idiot for a while, but you weren't hurt (I assume) & the other driver had a sore neck (the ambulance is a precaution in this day & age).  Cars can be replaced, people can't.  Don't be surprised if the other driver or her insurance sues you for the damages or your insurance goes up.  All you can do now is take this experience as a life lesson.|`|AA11658197	Having wrecks like that sucks. On one hand it's good that you feel bad and shook up, it shows you realize the weight of the situation. On the other hand don't beat yourself up too bad.

I am sorry this happened to you. You got a ticket, the driver got hurt, you were at fault.  I think you are very young, it takes a lot of driving time to accurately evaluate speed and distance. Most likely you were also distracted, and driving too fast. Did you have your phone in your hand when you hit? No one was killed, its unlikely they will sue you since you have insurance. Granted, I dont know if your parents will be able to afford insurance in the future for you. Driving is serious business, and you were at fault in this accident.  Someone very well could have been killed, I think you should consider this a wakeup call.  what if a pedestrian had darted between you and that car you hit? Expensive insurance is in your future. I know accidents happen, but rearending a stopped vehicle is purely your fault.|`|olujacECaa	I would just relax. After being in any sort of accident, anyone would be very shook up and guilty for some reason. Just defiantly relax, talk to some friends or family, and maybe take a nap and try to clear your mind.

q0GuI6oraa	It can. However most of the time the only way it affects the amp is if the sub grounds out and puts feedback into the amp. Most generally amps have fuses to handle such scenario's and in that case you just replace the fuse.
0OZ9dsUjaa	Get used ones and only replace the bad ones.<br>  <br>  And yeah as long as they have not completely locked up or collapsed you can drive it around and not damage anything. (however it won't run great till you fix them)

q0GuI6oraa	You can take it out fairly easily yourself.<br>  <br>  Step1: Unhook from battery under the hood (or in trunk?)<br>  Step2: If amp is screwed onto box just unplug all the wires except the wires going to the subs.<br>  Step3: Pull all the wiring out of your vehicle that is run back to the subs.<br>  <br>  For the rca and remote wire they will be tired into the back of your stereo. Simply cut the Remote wire (will say like auto antenna or remote on your stereo) be sure to cut the wire with plenty of room to re splice. Forget this step if it has a plug you can easily unplug it.<br>  <br>  Place your stereo back in shouldn't have much a problem with this.. it takes a lot more to wire it in than it does to take out.. I have no doubt you can handle this yourself.|`|pmbTAjRYaa	there is no need to waste money it is very simple you can do it the lazy way by leaving the wires and just capping off the ends with lots of electrical tape or you could follow every wire leading from the amp to the car and unplug them.

v6NdNE4xaa	dont tighten the nut until until you have removed the rear brake drums and adjusted the brake shoes so that there is a very slight drag on the drum when spinning the drum all you will do is tigten the cable you wont be adjusting the brake. by the way on a mk4 (astra g) the nut to tighten the cable is behind the handbrake gaiter (the leather cover at the lever) its always best too loosen this off before adjusting the rear shoes then tighten it up once adjuste untill their is around 5 clicks when pulling the handbrake up. dont know about any online manuals but you cant go far wrong with a haynes manual which you can borrow from your local library if they dont have it there the can get it for you|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	You need to adjust the rear brakes first, that should fix the hand brake being too loose.

L0H4iVHWaa	no, you will blow the subs if you hook 2 of those subs up to that 100watt amp cuz if the subs are 250rms watts, that means the pair of 500rms watts and that amp will give off 1000rms to that load that you use which is giving 500more watts than it should give off which means your subs will be over-powered and they will eventually blow, maybe in 1-2 weeks time.  you want a 500watt mono amp. such as the alpine mrp-m500, it puts out 500rms watts @ 2 ohms, which is what your subwoofer load needs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  __________________________________<br>  <br>  actually clint:<br>  <br>  a 1000rms watt amp would be around 500-600rms @ 4 ohms, but at 2 ohms it is 1000 rms watts, that is how mono block amps work, the number of watts that it shows is that output @ 2 ohms, its that way with ALL mono-block amps unless of course it is 1 ohm stable, which 80% of mono block amps are not 1 ohm stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  also NEVER set the gain by ear, do it this way:<br>  <br>  Here is a guide that will help you set the gain correctly <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88</a><br>  <br>  You'll need a multi-meter (AC voltmeter, $15 from Radio$hack), Microsoft Excel and a way to burn an audio CD from an MP3.<br>  <br>  If you don't have Excel, use this link <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g</a><br>  <br>  Set the LPF to just below the highest range of the frequency response of the subs.

Not sure which amp exactly you are looking at but remember to look at rms power more so than peak power when choosing an amp... Class D CEA compliant amps are the best to have.<br>  <br>  -------------<br>  Thanks edward... I use an oscilloscope and multimeter to personally set my gains. Are all monoblocks cea compliant if not that means your statement is incorrect. Not saying you are wrong on any of that but some off brands will say 1000w on them when its 1000w peak power when its only like 200w rms which is really what you need to care about.<br>  <br>  Edward is correct you should use an oscilloscope or multimeter or both to adjust your amp if available.

pmbTAjRYaa	no, it depends on how powerful your amp is...  Also it is not the reason your ap i in power save mode check your ground wire leading from the amp that is most likely the reason... make sure the wire is attached to bare metal andnot painted metal/plastic/or anything elong those lines. An amp will work properly without a dry cell batter. The difference is a dry cell battery recovers its charge quicker and may help if your headlights and interior lights dim. But so will a capacitor and a capacitor is also cheaper. for every 500 watts rms you need 1 farad in a cap. so if you have a 3500 rms amp like i do you need at least 7 farad to keep the lights from dimming|`|AA10721138	A yellow top is a deep cycle battery.

These can go bad and make a squeaking or grinding noise.|`|niskyMHRaa	Check your pulleys, take the belt off and hand spin all the pulleys, if one of them is out it will not spin as easy and may even squeak..replace belt whenever you take the time to remove it, usually its time for a replacement anyways. if its something like an idler pulley, or a delete pulley then its a simple fix, but if its something like an a/c compressor, or a power steering pump, then take to a mechanic. After this step, if the pulleys are ok your car should be taken to a mechanic because there is not much an average person can do.You should have your transmission fluid and your oil changed, those can cause a squeaking. If that doesnt work(yes, automotive can get expensive after this) then your bearings on the connecting rod are going out, if your check engine light is on while the squeaking is going on, take it to a repair shop as soon as you can, if the bearings are in fact busted, then it can end up causing the motor to seize, or stop running and not crank.
HMgRFOhqaa	Clutch judder is caused by, oil or other contaminates on plate, or a faulty pressure plate, I haven't a clue what your mechanic is talking about..'sweating of clutch' , if it's contaminates, try slipping the clutch<br>  ( handbrake on, 3rd or 4th gear, eng.revs about 2500, hold clutch pedal at 'biting point' for a minute or so,)  you will probably need a new complete clutch assy. and a rear crankshaft oil seal (if first remedy is no good) oh happy days...

hWc65sEtaa	I had something similar happen to me.  The person driving down the center lane was misusing the lane.  They should be at fault.  That's what the cop said in my case.  After our insurances fought it out, they both concluded it was 50/50 both faults. Good Luck, never admit fault.  Let the insurance companies deal with it.|`|qWmwI9PBaa	That is a good question.  First I want to say they were at fault as they were driving left of center, yet than again, it may be said that you failed to yield to the right of way.  I am gonna have to say that they were at fault.  This is because they were driving left of center, and therefore did not legally have the right of way.<br>  <br>  Keep me informed how this turns out, I am curious.|`|HfnXZ6T5aa	I think in your insurers eyes you would be at fault, due to not giving way, but if your insurer  is good enough you should be able to get a 50/50.
EjTikPNcaa	Most likely its an internal problem.  Could be the shift fork, a gear, shift cable or any number of clutch discs worn and out of place.

If it's internal, the part can be replaced but labor could be as much as 11 hours.  <br>  It's usually cheaper to replace the whole transmission.<br>  <br>  Reman from Hyundai $1508.00 with $1000.00 core charge.

Airflow meter values, 02 sensor<br>  readings, cylinder misfires, true running values, and adaptations/<br>  fuel trims are just a few that have to be verified.<br>  Visual and functional inspections of vacuum and air hoses are needed<br>  too.

0OZ9dsUjaa	The rollers and tensioners guide the engine timing belt and keeps a certain amount of tension on the belt so it doesn't allow the timing belt any slack to jump the belt  out of time (bending the valves) These items are normally a weak link so its recommended replacing them on a regular basis before they fail and destroy the engine.|`|KsMLHzbzaa	they provide smooth operation of the timing belts. When doing a big job, like waterpump or timing belt it is a very good idea to replace all the tensioners and rollers so they dont fail on you.Also replace the front seals. They wear just like any other part. You can buy whole timing kits, which include belts, tensioners, rollers. This is not a job for amateur mechanics. You need a special tensioning tool which can be bought from pelicanparts.com in order to do this. If you plan on doing this, take your time and do it right. good luck|`|Tdk3XohXaa	Rollers are the little round wheels that spin the belts.   Many t-belt failures are due to rollers that sieze up and cause the belt to break as a result. Tensioners are what keep the belt tight, slack free and from losing its tension.  Both are critical to do when the major service is carried out.

If the cost of fixing your car exceeds the fair market value, they will total it, and there is nothing you can do to change that.  Once they do, the car is theirs, they have bought it.  You can sometimes buy it back for salvage value, but if you do you will be given a salvage title, and will have a hard time getting insurance coverage for it if you plan to keep driving it.<br>  <br>  No, an attorney won't be able to help, nor will his ability to drive.

kFsviR9waa	Depending on the spring height you will need to compress them to get them of the strut, But sometimes just pushing down on the mount and tightening the bolt when u r putting on lowering spring should be enough, if everything is tightend and installed properly maybe you just bought blown tokicos , check if they are greasy and etc , rode on blown tokicos for a while and yes my car drifted over bumps nostop|`|AA10286987	Like Greg said, compressing the spring is only needed to get the strut top/top hat mounted on the strut safely, usually need with oem springs or oem length springs.<br>  <br>  If your ride is extremely bouncy then u could have blown struts (feels soft/squishy and suspension bottoms out easily). Struts are wet/oily where the shaft enters the strut housing.<br>  <br>  But I think you need an alignment done. When lowering this type of suspension it causes the front wheels to toe out and make the car not want to track straight (front feels loose and wonder side to side). Just recheck your work to make sure you guys didn't leave anything loose. Then take it to get aligned and "set Toe to factory specs" nothing else can be adjusted on this Honda/Acura factory suspension. Hope this helps out, good luck.
7Vj0vaSyaa	well...believe it or not, but the engineers who built your orignal suspension system designed it carefully so the car would handle well. By lowering it you are throwing all sorts of things out the window such as your castor angle, centre point steering and swivel pin inclination. This will result in poorer handling .|`|ii0hMr0caa	If your has strut type front suspension which by the reference to a top hat, I think it has, you will need a spring compressor to change the springs. You say the ride is poor, by this I assume you refer to body roll when cornering, before changing the springs check the condition of the dampers and the front anti roll bar bushes and couplings, if these are worn the ride will suffer. The purpose of suspension on a car is to keep all 4 wheels in contact with the road when cornering, lowering the suspension may lower the car's centre of gravity but it will also reduce the travel on the suspension. This will be great, up to a point when unexpectedly when cornering sharply, a wheel may lift off the road, drive and traction will be lost as well as the more important direction control (steering). You could spend a load of cash on a car to try to make it better, in my long experience, including some dramatic and memorable failures, if you want a better ride, buy a car with a better ride, remember the old saying, You can polish a turd all you like, but it's still a turd. Happy and probably expensive motoring!

CFA4KG2Uaa	your definitely going to have glass incurance since you probably financed the car and when you finance a car you have to get comprehensive coverage which comes with glass coverage. but i dont get why you are going with the insurance to fix this the dealer should. if you go through insurance your going to need to make a claim. it cant just happen like that.. i bought a pre owned bmw and the dealer gave  me a 30 day warranty in the beggining that covered every singl  part on the car such as tires and brakes. the dealer should be the one covering this.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Should have gotten a Toyota Celica GT-S!

I also think the consumer is so apprehensive that they almost force dealerships to do things the old way. If  customer goes into the dealership they want to get a price to shop with so they ask for the dealers best price, the dealer says you go shopping and i'll give you my best price when your done shopping. The customer then says no matter what i'll come back to give you a shot at the deal, then never shows up, because they bought somewhere else. Then they will tell you one thing and re-neg on it, they will say i'll buy it if you can do $10,000 plus trade, the dealer says ok you got a deal, the customer says ok i'll let you know.or the customer says they have perfect credit and they want the lowest payment so you base the payment on perfect credit rating and find out they have a 600 credit score. So until both sides get a trusting relationship things will never change, but people feel they are getting burned and the dealership feels they are getting lied to. i know a guy that told the dealer he had never been in a accident with his car when the dealer asked him if it ever had damage, when the dealer got the title the title was stamped salvaged. but they want the dealer to be straight with them.|`|k56mmj2eaa	I do not like the salesman they are a bit two pushy. they will not let you look at what you want to . they have to show you what they think you can afford.
UeWHGsqzaa	Firstly what are you allowed to ride? To begin with racing leagues are set up dependent on age of the rider. If the rider is quite young than it is more likely that they will be categorised for racing. These will also be restricted to how big the bike they can ride is. For example the youngest of riders will not be allowed to ride anything larger than say a 50cc or 85cc bike.<br>  <br>  However once you get older there are leagues set up dependent on the size of bike you ride or your ability.<br>  <br>  So check beforehand with your local organisation what the regulations are for you to enter the race. After this you are ready to look into buying a bike.<br>  <br>  Depending on what you are allowed to ride there are many different manufacturers of dirt bikes out there for you to choose from, and a lot of them have many options when it comes to after market parts for your bike.<br>  <br>  However again, if you are looking to modify your bike, make sure that you can enter into a league which allows you to do this, as some leagues will be set up for factory bikes (standard).<br>  <br>  The main manufacturers for you to choose from are the likes of KTM, Kawasaki, Gas Gas and Honda dirt bikes. There are also many more to choose from which will have similar build quality and performance specs to match these.<br>  <br>  So look into these different manufacturers and decide which bike is best for you, once you have purchased your bike all I can say is happy riding!|`|3CZxXdiLaa	Well, just start looking around, on websites such as craigslist.com, brand doesn't matter, just buy major manufacturers, like Honda, Kawasaki,  Yamaha, or Suzuki.  Definitely get a 4-stroke, dont even consider a 2-stroke as a beginner. Height and Weight matter too! a smaller bike would be better. like a yamaha tt-r 230 is a great beginner bike, its very forgiving. Just learn to ride before you buy anything, make sure its for you. then test ride a few bikes, and see what you like, and what you're comfortable with.

h7KKJA95aa	Lewis M, For car insurance the quickest method to get a free quote is do a auto policy comparison.

sqEydCZVaa	Its a difficult game.  The price paid for the platinum fluctuates from extreme highs to down in the dirt lows.  I go to my local metal recyclers from time to time and see what they are paying or predict in the future.  <br>  The price for all metal scrap is a wild ride.  One day I take in 3 aluminum wheels and get 45 bucks and the next day I get 4 bucks litterly.|`|CFA4KG2Uaa	yeah the best bet would be either ebay or craigslist but on ebay you could sell worldwide but craigslist i wouldnt suggest it. but you can sell CATS and DOGS on those websites.|`|eRX96A73aa	You will never get what you paid for them.

4Pe8yZnuaa	Get the job first.<br>  <br>  If you're young and have little to no credit, you'll need a parent co-signer, not to mention some cash down.|`|AA10788612	That's fine, but do not be surprised when they don't approve you. If you have no job yet, then you have no way of proving you can pay it back. Banks have really increased the standards to whom they give loans too. There was a time when you could get anything, but look at the economic times. People making minimum wage were getting cars that cost more than their monthly take home pay. Even a co-signer isn't a guarantee anymore. By all means go ahead & inquire, but be ready for disappointment. It's hard to get a loan unless your credit score is 720+, worked for 2 years straight at the same place, & have an income to debt ratio of 40% or lower. Plus, if you make (example) $30K/yr, they won't approve a loan that's over $15K for the car. And that's a good rule. Whatever you make annually, divide that by 1/2 & that should be the sticker price of your car (incentives not included). Doing that & staying in a car that's functional instead of "looks cool", will keep you out of trouble. But for now, one thing at a time. G'luck.|`|peRiq2Swaa	After you get a job you could check this place out.<br>  <br>  www.simplecredithelp.net

But that's not the case since you already took it to them for the same problem.<br>  <br>  (anyone who offers a lifetime warranty is probably going to try and get you to do a Co-Pay or weasel out of it with fine print, but the will have to honor it if you stand by your guns)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	that,s part of the motor then yes it should be covered. that,s a great warranty the dealership gave her.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	If you have a written warranty, you have the upper hand. You might just have a leaky water pump or hose, but don't take the chance. Have an independent shop look at it, first, to verify the problem. Remember, use ONLY genuine NISSAN coolant in thie car, or will have trouble on down the road!!! Don't let anyone tell you that all coolants are universal, or that it doesn't matter. These people have no experience or knowledge. Did you buy this car from a Nissan dealership??? Head gaskets are ALWAYS covered under the engine warranty. Good Luck!!|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Yes it should be unless otherwise noted on the warranty paperwork. usually it is all internal lubricated parts of the motor, and the head gasket is internal.|`|k56mmj2eaa	You would have to read the warranty to see if it is covered. Don't think it is under the warranty. or you could call the dealer and ask if it is covered.|`|5QrgHqZHaa	ya it should be, i remeber getting mine done under wranty.
d9ECb7N8aa	Contact BMW, or another trailer parts store. <br>  If I remember correctly, you will need the accessory harness made by BMW; If you try to splice in to the existing harness it will screw with the burnt-bulb indicators.|`|91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	you might have to wire that one from scratch. you will also need a hd flasher for the turn signals|`|k56mmj2eaa	Try calling the dealer. see if they have a harness. If not you can go to an automotive electrician and have them build you a harness it may be a bit pricey but that is what i would do if i could not find one.|`|VFTn5MVtaa	Try a local automotive parts shop or go to the BMW website! Good luck|`|PE1k59pcaa	you will need to use a converter module harness, tow ready #119190.look at etrailer.com.
d9ECb7N8aa	It does it only when the motor is cold?<br>  <br>  Blame the hydraulic lifters. You can run a lighter oil in the winter, this will help with the issue, then go to a heavier oil during the summer. The lighter oil is easier to pump through the motor, so it reaches the lifters quicker. Not a big deal though.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	alot of them do that, my dads had the same problem, and my 2000 with a 5.3 did it for a little, its nothing to worry about i think it just takes a little for the oil to get distributed throughout the valve train and for everything to heat up and fit snug.  i should note that when i put an ls2 in my silverado the noise has not been an issue, its a different valvetrain but the same basic engine design, who knows|`|k56mmj2eaa	Sounds like your lifters are starting to stick. Take a pint of transmission Fluid put it in the oil and that will clean your lifters if they are dirty. If you have bad lifter springs you will need to change lifters. but give the transmission oil a try before changing anything. Believe me it will not hurt the engine. i use it all the time in my ford ranger.|`|PE1k59pcaa	try putting in some marvel mystery oil this might loosen up sticky lifter,it wont harm anything if it doesnt solve ticking noise|`|VFTn5MVtaa	Try using a thicker motor oil, as engines age they create little spaces in between moving parts and so if you still use a thin motor oil when you start it, it makes those noises until oil reaches those parts.  Good luck!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	that,s your valve lifters. if they are adjustable then you can take up the slack in them.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Someone has been using really cheap oil in this engine. It might be you, or a previous owner. What is happening is that the valve lifters, which rely on a steady flow of oil through them to retain hydraulic pressure, are gummed up with sludge. The correction is to have the engine oil flushed with a chemical, like butyl cellosolve, that under oil pressure will dissolve the crusty sludge and varnish infused through-out your entire lubrication system. This "crud" should litterally melt away, and the lubrication pores in the valve lifters and the oil feeds to the lifters will wash out. Then, begin using a good synthetic oil,like Mobil One, or ELF oil, that will maintain the internal cleanliness of your engine and will prevent future oil gallery clogging. If you have been unlucky enough to have been using QS or other bulk oils, you may need more than one treatment. Good Luck!!! Regular dino oils always break down under heat and age ino their waxy counterparts. SYnthetic oils simply last longer, protect better, and continuous ly clean things as you drive. Get the picture???

5mCm2XTLaa	Seeing there's no coolant in the oil pan what your looking at is one of the oil galley plugs. Most likely you'll find it came from the front of the engine block and got mangled up by the timing chain or gears. So the first place I'd look is behind the timing cover. Usually oil galley plugs are threaded, and people wonder why G.M. is on the skids.<br>  <br>  Check out the link for a picture looks like a freeze plug only smaller diameter is 45/64" or .700 slightly smaller than a dime, Dorman part # 555082<br>  <br>  Edit: Most likely it came from one of the lifter galleys, there's one on either side of the cam shaft slightly above the center line. You'll have to remove the timing cover and timing gear to gain access.<br>  <br>  Check out the picture in the link. It's not the same engine as your but V8 engine block but pretty similar. Note where the timing cover used to be. See the cam bearing? The oil galley plug is right next to it, one on each side. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dcadillac%2Bengine%2Bblock%26ni%3D18%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fr2%3Dtab-web%26xargs%3D0%26pstart%3D1%26b%3D37&w=500&h=333&imgurl=static.flickr.com%2F26%2F66391425_fb1c849980.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fcadmanof50s%2F66391425%2F&size=164.8kB&name=66391425_fb1c849980.jpg&p=cadillac+engine+block&type=JPG&oid=234eecf6c43e29bc&fusr=cadmanof50s&tit=66391425_fb1c849980.jpg&hurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fcadmanof50s%2F&no=52&tt=272&sigr=11inlfh9g&sigi=11csp9b2o&sigb=13lkj9otc&sigh=119hlano4">http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...</a>|`|HFrsH9MRaa	It is a common problem in many old Cadillac engines for the head to not receive proper oil pressure. The oil pumps in these cars are like tinker toys. If synthetic oil has not been used in this engine regularly, many parts of the lubrication system can fail. They usually fail, anyway from the design. The part you see in the pan most likely is the oil pressure relief valve, or a part of it. It is supposed to regulate the oil pressure throughout the engine. I have had 3 Caddy's literally break down on the way to my shop with this problem. Your best solution is to replace the oil pump, complete with new pressure relief valve. Hopefully, an aftermarket part will last longer than the factory unit. It is also possible that the cam bearings have spun around in their shells, and lock off oil pressure feed to cam bearings and head. In Detroit, there used to be 10 shops that only rebuilt Caddy engines. They were constantly busy!!!! Good Luck!!!!

Newer cars have OBD2 and in 2011 they will come out with OBD3. Auto Zone can only read cars that have OBD2 systems which are on cars from 1996 till present. To get your car scanned you need to go to a mechanic their scan tools are much better than the ones auto zone has. Also just so you know the only fan that's supposed to be on when the A/C is on is the drivers side fan. The passenger side fan will only come on if the car needs extra cooling after the drivers side fan has come on. The fans will only come on once the temp goes past 225~230 degrees. But your car probably has not bean serviced properly when it comes to the coolant system. Read my other answer I gave you it tells how to properly fill the coolant system. If your car sits in traffic the temp will rise up but once you start to go than the gage will drop (assuming you have a Lumina Euro with the optional sport gage cluster) if you don't than you have the base gage cluster which only has a speedo and a fuel gage. Your temp "gage", battery voltage, and oil pressure are just idiot lights.|`|RiQA4Epraa	go to autozone<br>  get it scanned<br>  itll tell you what the problemis

You could perhaps have a dead short which is robbing your current. If the lights are dim it does sound like the current from the alternator is not getting back to the battery. Not sure if your vehicle has what is called a voltage regulator, this is what regulates the volts going back to the battery from  the alternator. You could have a bad ground, make sure the ground cable from the battery has a good connection not only on the battery but where it is attached at the other end, usually to the frame of the vehicle. Good hunting.

ESY1pBnPaa	Find a local tuner, and find out what they are comfortable using.  You're going to have to pay someone to tune it for you anyways, because tuning is not an easy thing to do and you'll need to get it tuned on a dyno.  If the tuner is familiar with Honda, then they should also be familiar with different systems.  For example, getting your ECU chipped, and then having the tuner use a program like Crome, eCtune, or Uberdata (all free programs), will be much cheaper than getting something like a Hondata unit and having them tune it.

However if you do not get the proper answer of any that you're satisfied with please just PM me and I will let you know what I find out.<br>  <br>  The very best of luck with this.<br>  <br>  Have a great evening....<br>  <br>  PS...you can also contact me at mclill @ yahoo . com  <br>  Just copy and paste but do some backspacing as you can't put email addresses here.

Gn0nR2S1aa	Why do you want the car to backfire? Perhaps you want it to flame out the tail pipe or something? If you describe what you wish to accomplish, then maybe you'll get the answers you are looking for.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	You are joking, aren't you?|`|plFyCtm3aa	A flame kit.

You don't need to be out on the water and have something go wrong that ends up costing you hundreds to get towed back in.

7BHIyMFmaa	It's a "Triton engine" although it's a weaker one. The non-PI 4.6/5,4L engines were pretty gutless in the bigger trucks. 235 HP really isn't enough for a 6000+ pound vehicle. If your budget allows it get a newer model, 2000 or newer that has the more powerful P.I. engines.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Only if it's the F250LD (or is it also the F150HD which looks like the newer F150) with the rounded front end.<br>  <br>  The older boxy front end trucks still had the 351/460/7.3L|`|pqNDMvJJaa	they had triton engines in 1998.5.4 L

ZEwAalKPaa	I do not know just why people want tinted windows in grey old England but there you go, whatever rings your bell.<br>  <br>  Many of the diy tint jobs i have seen have not looked too good so i guess if you really want tints maybe you would be safer having them professionally done.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	I did it on the rear side windows of an old car I had and actually had success, but the windows were basically flat and I was able to completely remove them which greatly simplified the job. The front side windows of my truck were done professionally with the same stick on tint and look great. Don't just get any Mechanic though, find a shop that specializes in customizing. Here its about $100 per window.|`|1NK1hK1Taa	It isn't a case of some kits not looking good and leaving bubbles. It is ALL down to the skill of the person doing the job. You need to have prepared the glass well before applying the material. Only by going slowly and pressing the material as you stick it on the glass will you not have any bubbles. Ideally you need something stiff but with a rounded edge to use to rub hard along the line where the material is sticking to the glass, The best thing to use is the proper tool. Look for a sign writer who sells stick on signs and ask them very nicely for one of their plastic application tools. You might get one for free or it will only cost you a couple of quid. Prepare the glass first, and then apply the material slowly and as per the instructions.|`|8kd1uvqVaa	1<br>  scub the glass your working on  inside and out with a spray bottle with a bit of  johnstones  baby oil<br>   <br>  2<br>  soak the outside of the window with the solution then apply the  tint(the  tint apply it so that  when the adhesive side is facing you if comes pre cut all the better<br>  if not cut a bit  of tint larger than the  window your doing<br>   once this is on with a craft knife or a scalpel trim around the shape of the glass and careful and take your time<br>  <br>  3<br>  <br>    use a plastic card( or a car body filler  spreader)  and a soft lint free cloth and  spread out the  the wrinkles and bubbles<br>  <br>  4<br>  if you get crease or fingers as known as if use a  heat gun  or a hot hairdryer and apply the heat over the finger ( little is better than more as if too much heat will damage the tint film)<br>  <br>   keep doing this till you have the tint on the window as is all flat and level<br>  <br>   when thi is doen you will have the  perfect  shape of the glass as some glass curves in more than one direction<br>  <br>  5 <br>  once  this is done<br>   soak the inside of the window with the solution<br>  take the film from outside of the  window and peel the backing from the tint<br>  <br>  6 apply the tint and again use the card with soft cloth to squeeze out  bubbles  and solution<br>  <br>   if any finger apear  again with the heat gun apply  some light heat and   will get the tint to  go flat<br>  <br>  7<br>  once this is done  with the card and a small bit of solution damp the edges of the tint   and push  any edges into the  window seals or what ever<br>  <br>   leve a few days to dry<br>  <br>   rmemeber the front window( front doors) cannot b anymore than 30% tint<br>  <br>   the  window  back  from them can be any tint you prefer|`|bQmMNG5vaa	I would get it done professionally,its too easy to leave air bubbles in it unless you are confident of doing it yourself.<br>  You need to take the windows out to make a really good job of it.|`|zeZtFbGjaa	I tried to do it myself and i ruined them!! ya have 2 peel both sides aswell as cut out the shape of your windows, never mind the bubbles!!!<br>  <br>  Get some1 professional, otherwise your wasting your money|`|EhyT1GnHaa	You can do it yourself if you feel confident. Price around $30, compared to professional $150-$200 depending on how many windows. The side or flat glass windows are fairly easy, the back glass which alot of them are curved is quite difficult unless you did it before. If you don't put the tint on properly yes there will be bubbles.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Actually a fair question.  It was originally called the "Reserve Officer Training Corps", because one got a "Reserve Commission" when one graduated.  This is opposed to a "Regular Commission" which is what one got out of the Academy.  The idea stemmed from the 1950's when the US thought it would have to refight WW2 this time against the Soviets.  At the beginning of that war, there were not enough active-duty, and National Guard (The Reserve as we know it didn't exist) officers to handle the expansion. So the idea came about to get some junior officers trained up, that's the idea behind the active duty commitment, then release them to go to Reserve units or civilian jobs.  When the Big Red Machine crossed the German border, recall them.<br>  The biggest difference between Regular and Reserve commissions was as a Regular officer one cannot be summarily dismissed, i.e. removed from active-duty due to downsizing or the whim of one's service.  Used to actually go to an "Augmentation Board" not unlike a promotion board to be selected for a Regular commission.  That's how mine came down.<br>  Good news for you is, ALL officers upon commissioning are now given Regular Commissions.<br>  - You do choose what you fly based on your SUPT CLASS ranking, not your military rank.  Primarily though it's needs of the service and instructor recommendations.<br>  SUPT: Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training.|`|DkrgKFgraa	Yeah, that's what's it for. I'm going that route too for a pilot. Good luck!
AA11435704	Unless your name is on the car loan, there is no way that you will be held responsible. If he finances the car and passes away before it is paid off, the and the loan will be part of his estate. Usually in cases like this either someone in the family will want the car for the loan balance, or the bank will take the car back as a repossession. <br>  <br>  As long as he is healthy enough to drive, and can afford the car that he wants he should go for it.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Why does he want another car? Why not sell or trade one or both of the other cars?<br>  <br>  When someone dies, their estate is responsible for settlement of debts, which means there's less going to heirs such as yourself. This is usually handled in probate court.|`|GHd84xipaa	your your father can get credit insurance when he buys the car and if he passes away that coverage will paid the car off.have him ask the dealer about it.something like this is available on all loans.|`|AA10788612	OK, I'm in a similar situation. Both of my folks, they're retired, have two cars already. They only use one. I have encouraged them to sell the nicer of the two for money to be used for bills. Then they can trade off the other car for a decent econo-box. When they finance the car at a bank, some places offer insurance to pay off the car in the event of an emergency or loss of life. This is what he should do to prevent you from having to deal with this extra burden. If he should pass away in the next four or five years, the car will just about be paid for. Then the balance will be manageable if you want to resume the loan. For now if he is in good health, active, & is able to understand what he is doing, then let him do as he pleases. It feel that it would be hard to talk him out of it, so save your energy. But do try to have him trade one of the cars off. Just to save on insurance & have extra room. Good luck.|`|QAEm0Yitaa	You should go for it :) being that old he deserves a new car to be comfortable in. if he passes away they will not come after you, they will just repossess the car.<br>  Hope i helped <br>  (please give points)|`|bW931jBaaa	It would be paid off in that time. Even if it was not paid off, the estate would pay it off.<br>  Why not lease a new car? Then there is no worries!|`|AA11516198	a person his age can NOT get credit insurance., the money left owing may go against his estate, maybe he could trade in his other cars, on a nice 2008 -09 low milage, it would pay off quicker. and really make more sense.

bqLvWpcZaa	If you're looking specifically at those years, you only have 4 choices:<br>  240D ( 2.4 L 4-cylinder )<br>  300DT ( 3.0 L 5-cylinder turbo )<br>  300SD ( 3.0 L 5-cylinder turbo )<br>  190D 2.2 ( 2.2 L 4-cylinder )<br>  The 5-cylinder turbo diesel would be my recommendation in either the W123 300D or the W126 300SD. It's essentially the same engine in both vehicles ( just some very minor differences between the 2 ) but they're about as close to indestructible as you can get for an internal combustion engine. The diesel injection pump is also mechanical so it can be converted quite easily.|`|QEgpIxuKaa	In addition to what Jay P included, if you can find a 2.5 Turbo, (5 cyl), by all means pick it up as it was one of the most trouble free diesels ever built by MB or pretty much by anyone.  I'm not sure exactly what years would include that engine in the US but I had a 90 300D2.5 that was a wonderful vehicle with very good acceleration and 35 to 38 MPG highway.  With dates that old you are in a bit of a gamble as to how these were maintained.  I had a 1985 190D 2.2 with a 5 speed transmission and, while it was painfully doggy, ran to 250K miles when I sold it without using a drop of oil between changes and got, (no kidding), 42 - 45 MPG highway on a straight road trip.  Unfortunately the rest of the car did not hold up as well as the engine and I ended up rebuilding the front end as well as replacing the rear end differential over the 5 years I owned it.  This car by the way is still on the road today with over 350K miles.  The 190D 2.2 was the car of choice for German taxi cabs for many years as they ran forever and got great mileage|`|Dqwajq4Qaa	Given the fact that the years you are looking into are long gone and the cars are no considered semi-classic ONE piece of consideration should be used before anything else. <br>  <br>  What the condition is the car in? <br>  <br>  Look at key strengths of these cars such as:<br>  <br>  Mileage, <br>  Check frame for rust and/or warpage<br>  Check the condition of the brake pedal under the driver's seat.<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb; if the rubber is really "smeared" the car was a city car, if not it was a primary highway commute. Highway is best.<br>  <br>  Specifically, I checked the years you asked about, and no definite review came up, just personal mb owners bragging about their own. <br>  <br>  Do your research as to how to examine ANY used car and you'll be fine.

Or it may be some other reason entirely - hard to say why exactly without knowing about your driving style or where you drive most often.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	18K miles is really short for brakes.   You should be getting easily twice that.  But you were right in having the squeaking checked out.   Some advice though is NEVER go to a dealership unless it is for warranty work.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, what I do is every six months or so I take off the wheels of my truck and check the wear on the brake pads front and back.  I check for even wear and if the rotors are not being marred.   If the pads needs replacing I buy new pads and replace them myself.  Keep in mind that you replace both front or both back not just one side or the other.<br>  <br>  If the rotors/drums need work that is when you need the services of a good machine shop.  <br>  <br>  Continuing.  Then I make sure the brake fluid reservoir is topped off and go for a little drive around the block to make sure the brakes are working properly.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the parking brake!<br>  <br>  You should do this with your Honda as well.   This will do a few things.  It will let you know how fast your brakes are wearing out.  It will get you more familiar with your vehicle (always a good idea).  And you can learn how to replace the brakes yourself.  Disc brake pads are very easy to replace and the pads are not that expensive.  A decent set of pads are $45.00 from any auto parts store.<br>  <br>  I bet Honda charged you a hell of a lot more than $45.00!|`|3mo8vrpTaa	It is not unheard of to replace brakes that often, IF a driver brakes hard going into corners and waits to the last moment to stop.  It is all about driving style.  Learn to change your own brakes, its simple on a honda.<br>  Then have fun driving.  Or radical change your style.<br>  <br>  P.S. There are different compounds used in break pads and shoes.  The ceramic and metal compounds do last longer but they use up your rotors much faster.  I use the softer compounds myself and change pads more often then some. They are cheep and takes only minuets to change|`|DV4xyeChaa	18K not normal...with a new car id expect 40 to 60K...unless you r a bad driver and live in bumper to bumper or ride the brake...   and the front brakes do 80% of braking..and should wear out twice as fast as rear....unless u got a sticking caliper.....better ask..
