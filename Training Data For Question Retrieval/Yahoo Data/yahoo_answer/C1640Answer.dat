FxFqg5Qhaa	I've lived in Melbourne and Brisbane, and visited Canberra and Sydney. Out of these I would recommend Brisbane. Really depends what kinda lifestyle you're after though. Brisbane is a lot more laid back than the other cities from my experience. It is only an hour north or south to beautiful beaches and holiday destinations, and the theme parks. Also Brisbane is the closest biggest city to northern QLD with the reefs and beautiful islands etc. <br>  <br>  I personally find Sydney and Melbourne to busy and hectic and big. <br>  <br>  Also as you will be nursing, there are some good hospitals in Brisbane. I work as a paramedic so know them well  - Royal Brisbane Hospital, Prince Charles for predominantly Respiratory/Cardiac, The Princess Alexandra, Mater Public, Royal Children's, and Mater Children's. And these are just the public hospitals around Brisbane City. Plus the many private hospitals and public hospitals further out. <br>  <br>  Brisbane house prices and rent prices are also falling at the moment and would definitely be cheaper than Melb or Sydney. And the outer suburbs of Brisbane are still on 20-25mins from the CBD. <br>  <br>  Weather wise I also think Brisbane has the best climate of Australia. We get hot summers around 30-35C and mild winters, normally not having too many days below 20C during winter. Melbourne can have four season's weather in one day!! We were there a few weeks ago and it was 46C one one day, and 19C the next day, no joke! <br>  <br>  I've never been to Adelaide, Perth or Tasmania so can't comment on those.|`|DRaq0kz9aa	Depends on what lifestyle your after.<br>  <br>  I would say Sydney because of the nice weather, beaches, harbour and friendly people. But I live in Sydney so may be bias :).  Sydney is probably the most expensive place to live in Australia though ie rents.  And it can be very hard to find a place as we have a rental shortage.  <br>  <br>  I lived in Melbourne for 25 years and found it rather boring and the weather depressing (overcast 9 months of the year). <br>  <br>  I hear all the time Perth is a very nice city to live, but then you are isolated from the rest of Australia.|`|MI3r3jWeaa	Sydney or Adelaide.
TskZHzZyaa	Plenty to do:<br>  - Shopping on Michigan Avenue or State Street in the City, Oak Brook Mall in the west burbs, Old Orchard in the North burbs, Rover Oaks in the south burbs.<br>  - Walk around Chicago and you'll see great architecture and sculpture, some of which you'll recognize from movies and TV.<br>  - Hang out at Millennium Park and Grant Park.  Bring a bike and ride the 26-mile lakefront trail.  Bring your swimsuit in the summer and visit the beaches.<br>  - Get a birds eye view at the Hancock or Sears Towers.<br>  - World Class Museums: Art, Contemporary Art, Field, Mus of Sci and Industry, Chicago History.  <br>  - The Chicago Cultural Center has a lot of great free stuff to do at Michigan and Randolph.  If you're a TV nut there is the Museum of Broadcasting in the Cultural Center.<br>  - Zoos: Lincoln Park, Notebeart Nature Center, Brookfield Zoo.<br>  - Garfield Conservatory (free!) on the west side, Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Chicago Botanical Gardens north side.<br>  - Biking: Illinois Prairie Path runs from Forest Park blue line station parking lot on to Wheaton, the splits with a branch to Aurora and another to Elgin, both connected by the Fox River Trail.<br>  - There is a very cool authentic windmill in Geneva, it was relocated there from Oak Brook in the 1900's and has been restored.  There is a Frank Lloyd Wright house nearby as well.<br>  - Speaking of, Oak Park is a very nice city with many Frank Lloyd Wright houses and Unity Temple, a wonderful church he did.<br>  - Ride the train, Metra or CTA, to your destinations, save on parking and gas, and experience a train ride.  Everyone can chat and not worry about being behind the wheel.<br>  - Cubs and Six start in a month!  And the Chicago Fire soon as well.<br>  - Naperville has a really nice Riverwalk with great public spaces, bridges, a pool, and the fourth largest Campanile (bell tower) in the world.  There is a hill nearby great for listening to campanile concerts in the summer and for sledding in the winter.<br>  - The Naper Settlement in Naperville is a great place to learn about early history.<br>  - St. Charles and Geneva are charming little towns in the far west burbs, restful with unique shopping and nice river walks.<br>  - Evanston is a great city and Northwestern University has shows lectures and attractions.<br>  - Hop on the South Shore and explored the Dunes.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|3sP4Mto6aa	Their is Navy Pier, downtown, and there is the Shedd Aquarium, and other things you might think are fun, but Im not sure on whats in the suburbs, just familiar with down town, Hope this Helps!|`|3UqHzIK6aa	Six Flags Great America in Gurnee.

PA0bGBtCaa	There's a whole bunch of factors that goes into determining the price of an airline ticket:<br>  <br>  1.) Competition: If there are multiple carriers running a market, they are all usually in the same general ballpark in means of pricing. <br>  <br>  2.) Economic Factors: Things such as fuel. When jet fuel is really expensive as it was in 2008, then the all of the airlines will increase their air fares to compensate for the extra cost in the fuel.<br>  <br>  3.) Load Factor: This is the single greatest factor in pricing. The load factor is the percentage of how many seats are filled with revenue customers on a given flight. The key here is to get the perfect load factor. Sure you may think that having a sold out flight is the best method, but not always. With all the extra people, comes extra weight. So airlines are tricky here. They will price their air fares a bit more expensive to ensure that the plane is only filled up to a certain capacity, maybe 70-80% They may figure that this percentage gives the best optimum fuel range on the plane and the plane can still make money on the flight.<br>  <br>  Gone are the days of just selling cheap fares to fill the seats. That isn't making money. When it comes to the yield, or the profit they actually made off the flight, they need higher air fares. Are there formulas? Yes, and they are really complicated. I would recommend reading this book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UPLnchdDQLcC&dq=richard+zeni+books&printsec=frontcover&source=in&hl=en&ei=B6CySYYai6C3B7H_4bsH&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=14&ct=result#PPP1,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=UPLnchd...</a><br>  <br>  It was written by Richard Zeni. He currently works for JetBlue Airways and is lieterally the "pioneer" in the way that air fares are calculated today. He used to work for US Airways and he was the behind the scenes crusader in bringing them out of the hole with better revenue management. The book online is a sample, but there's more than enough stuff in there to give you the big picture.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	There are LOTS of equations involved.

I'm sure there's at least one. You might need to resort to a motel though. Try out of the actual city too, like 5-10 miles out. You might have better luck that way and better rates. Also you could try recruiting someone who's 21 to go on the trip with you, that way you won't have anything to worry about.
pSd8a8ieaa	It's a medium sized, modern city with a population of 1.8million and 7.2million of metro population.<br>  The public transportation system is mediocre, transporting in downtown shouldn't be a problem but to the suburbs, traffic is often congested and the metro system isn't that extensive. The buses are dirty and poorly maintained except Rapid KL, which is the bets among all IMO. The cost of living is extremely low, foods are cheap (normally RM3 onwards), hotel fares are cheap, transportation is cheap, fuel is cheap, real estate is cheap. The only expensive thing is Liquor. <br>  Downtown Kuala Lumpur is still considered safe for tourists or westerners but do be noted that bag snatching is on the rise.<br>  This city is multi-cultured, so you'll be able to see lot's of colors in this city. Night life is good but it shuts down before 2am.

If a Muslim Imam comes on TV. telling people or advising people in how to behave according to the Islam which does not match your ideas then on the spot you will see such a spreading to the world telling how BAD is Islam. Well ... to be honest with you friend I take what ever Christians or Jewish say about Islam is to show me how afraid they are from the spreading of this great religion. They are trying to persuade and tell all those people who are on the way to convert to Islam that Islam is no good... That makes Islam very strong rather than putting Islam down to those people. I can tell you that much about the latest statistics from European countries which is really alarming for many priests and to the Pope, There are no less than 1000 new converts to Islam on monthly basses in Europe since the Sep.11th. attacks. I think that is why most of the Europeans are worried today and that is why they keep on doing all that kind of stuff. I Call it fearing these converts from their new believes.<br>  I am a Muslim and by God very proud of it too|`|uidg8Uh0aa	this is an old tv extract of an interview with a muslim scholar.<br>  clearly he is not representative of all bahrainis or muslims around the world for that matter and he only represents himself and the people willing to take advice from him. <br>  <br>  When a british christian priest denies the holocaust, noone claims all of chrisitianity to be responsible for his sayings. please adhere to the same principle of judgement for all religions.|`|Gynfzaoxaa	Let me put it this way, the view of individuals you know does not necessarily reflect the view of all.<br>  <br>  <br>  And drivers in Bahrain are yes, rude.

But if you're likely to become noisy or belligerent when you're drunk then obviously it's not a good idea.  It might be a better idea to take anxiety medication and/or a Tylenol PM (or some other sleeping medication) to knock yourself out.  It will not only help with your anxiety, but if you can sleep for most of the flight, you will feel better once you're in Europe and it will help with the jet lag as well.  A couple of drinks could also help you sleep, but I wouldn't recommend having several drinks and getting drunk because that could also make you feel hungover (especially since you're more likely to be dehydrated on a plane).|`|a7c22dd3a3ed6b12011a02bf27c95704aa	You'll probably get belligerent with the flight attendants & get kicked off the plane.|`|WBYVEViraa	I'm ALWAYS a fan of getting drunk before a flight.

If you want to save some money, the Uniden GMR1235-2 work great as well and are only $20 on Amazon.|`|XBulMn2zaa	Walkie talkies are the answer, but make sure to get the best you can afford.  some of the cheaper ones won't go through all the metal to work if someone is several floors below.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Cruise lines actually encourage bringing walkie talkies on board for this reason.

MwCQ5zkMaa	At my place, I live in the canton (similar to state) Zurich, in the city Winterthur, and my high school graduation will be in July 11th. We do have holiday in the month February for two weeks as a winter sport holiday.|`|tMJhvpeEaa	summer vacation is in some where in June|`|AA10982716	I don't know if there is much of a graduation per se, but school ends in mid-June to mid-July. Summer vacation depends on the canton, here in Zurich it's from the second week in July to the third week in August. Most places seem to have a couple more weeks off.<br>  <br>  There is school in Feb but most places get one or two weeks off for a sport holiday. A few have it the end of January or the beginning of March.

RbmfJX5gaa	Ignore the bogan answer.<br>  <br>  Personally the eastern side of Lake Macquarie is much nicer than the Newcastle area. Warners Bay, Speers Point area is really good as it is really close to the lake, schools, sporting fields, shopping centres and is only 20-30 mins from Newcastle CBD.<br>  <br>  Other good suburbs in Newcastle are New Lambton, Kotara,  Adamstown Heights. It all depends on your housing budget though. I am not naming rich suburbs either. Just normal family suburbs close to amenities.<br>  <br>  Places to avoid are the western side of Lake Macquarie, Windale, Glendale, Barnsley, West Wallsend and anything out that way. Windale is NSW worst suburb. It is a hole. The western side of Lake Macquarie has much higher crime rates and lower socio economic people living in housing commission properties. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is check out each council's website which will gove you an idea of services for the community.<br>  <br>  www.lakemac.com.au<br>  www.ncc.nsw.gov.au<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9rFLdntlaa	Industrial.<br>  <br>  If you have a choice, try further up the coast.

fKpBXXJbaa	A 200g letter can be sent airmail to Germany for ￡2.44 (￡1.90 if you write "SMALL PACKET" on the top of the envelope - to use the small packet rate you can send a letter relating to the contents, but no other personal correspondence). Prices go up for each 20g in weight - the "large letter" size is irrelevant for when you're sending mail abroad, it only affects pricing within the UK. The maximum size for an airmail letter or packet is the same - no single dimension (length, width, and depth) longer than 600 mm, and the three dimensions together must not total more than 900 mm. A4 is 210 x 297 mm. <br>  <br>  I think you got the size a bit wrong - A2 (420 x 594 mm)  folded in half is A3 (297 x 420 mm), A3 folded in half is A4. You can't send something A2 sized by airmail because 420 + 594 is more than 900 mm. But you could send something A3 sized (717 mm total, up to 183 mm thick (a bit less, allowing for slightly larger envelopes) before you hit the 900 mm limit), and something A4 sized (507 mm) up to 397 mm thick.|`|4UQegWk0aa	Go into the post office and they will weight it and print a stamp, it needs an airmail sticker too. It will be more expensive if you say there is a letter in there, it will go small packet rate if it doesn't have a letter inside it. But a letter  can also be described as a note and that could go small packet rate. (hint hint.....)|`|4SRrWBVZaa	hi go on ebay and go to the sell link they have a postage calculator if you know the weight you can work it out x hi just worked it out on the site would be about ￡2.44 airmail letters hope this help.x
Jm3vMKx3aa	The regular one-way fare for the destination Roma Termini to Napoli Centrale amounts to<br>  ? €10.50 on Regional trains (2h 41 min.)<br>  ? €19.50 on Intercity trains (2h 02 min.)<br>  ? €36.10 on Eurostar Italia (1h 21 mins.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=c79686605528a110VgnVCM1000003f16f90aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.js...</a>|`|CDhn1NrKaa	I think € 20 max|`|d9a3701ca2b1a14e04c269f60d8cc693aa	The best solution is the train, I even don't know if a bus does still exist.<br>  You could purchase the train ticket online (english web-site).<br>  I would buy a ticket for a train called Frecciarossa (1h,21min, ca 36-Euro) but also a Eurostar (abbr. ES, it takes 1:54min, ca. 28-Euro)  or the Intercity (ICplus, 2h, 09min, about 20-euro) are very good. The other lines are less comfortable, expecially for a tourist. All start from Napoli-Centrale and they arrive in Roma-Termini. For price reduction I think, you should ask at the ticket window in Naples.<br>  If your travel starts from Pompeii then you have to take first the Circumvesuviana (see enclosed link in english) to go to Naples. It stops in Napoli Centrale, where the train to Rome starts. I don't take a Circumvesuviana since ages but they told me it is unpleasant because of the population, a bit like the metro in NY, when you travel to the JFK-airport. (To be sure avoid it at night). I believe, that people in Pompeii (i.e.the hotel keeper) will tell you the best way to travel to Naples (tell them you want to go to "Stazione Centrale", the main station).<br>  Good luck, enjoy your voyage and of course take care but don't worry too much. Italy is not so dangerous, despite Berlusconi ;-)

I20mtK1Oaa	It'll likely be warm by then so if you're planning to be outside a lot (i.e. touring the monuments and walking around the city) I'd suggest bringing shorts.  That said, our temperatures can fluctuate very quickly.  We got 6" of snow here on Monday and today (Saturday) it's 70 degrees.<br>  <br>  If you bring light layers you should be fine (some shorts and jeans, plus a light sweater just in case).<br>  <br>  Have a good trip!!|`|23b69e7f8073aa893274935eee6f43ceaa	Definitely shorts for sightseeing - and comfortable shoes.  It will likely be at least warm, and could actually get quite hot - it's not as likely to be unbearably hot as July or August, but it would not be unheard of for it to get up to to 90 in June. And it will probably be at least well into the 70s for a high temperature.  Maybe bring jeans or other long pants (i.e. khakis) for going out to dinner - unless you're planning on going to a more formal restaurant, but there really aren't too many restaurants that are so formal. But for doing any of the tourist stuff - I would say bring shorts and short sleeved t-shirt.  If it's unusually cool at night, maybe bring a windbreaker or light sweater but you shouldn't need anything heavier than that.|`|JuiZR23Paa	It should be in the 70's to 80's.<br>  Bring capris and shorts.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	usually pretty hot.

TLA7A3Ksaa	I checked on the Italian Wikipedia.  And I'm italian. <br>  Valle d'Aosta is the smallest region of Italy.  It's 100% mountain so it is not very populated ( 126.660 people in 3.263 km^2). Economy is based on tourism, and on 3^rd sector in general. Some agricultural products are cheese ( Fontina, Toma di Gressoney, Reblec, Seras...), bread, wine, fruit.... <br>  <br>  - main lakes: Lago di Beauregard, lago di Place-Moulin, Lago di Cignana. They  are artificial, lakes for electricity. <br>  <br>  - main rivers: Dorea Baltica. "Valle" is valley in italian and the region is the valley of this river.<br>  <br>  - it is a touristic region for ski during winter. there are other sites like <br>  Castello di Fénis ? Castello di Issogne ? Forte di Bard ? Castello di Verrès ? Castello Savoia a Gressoney-Saint-Jean.<br>  <br>  they are castles. <br>  <br>  if you have others questions, ask, i m italian so i can get more infos

From Houston to Las Vegas, it is 6.1 hours in a car, and 3.4 hours in a plane.|`|SVIDSzLfaa	i'd take the shortest possible flight at the cheapest possible rate.|`|i47AGNpJaa	It's flight time versus driving time.<br>  <br>  Gd Bless you-<br>  <br>  Captain Art Griego|`|keGOvavbaa	The people who have suggested that this is the flight time versus the driving time apparently have never driven between Las Vegas and Houston (and, therefore, realize that even via the interstate, it's hard to travel nearly 1,500 miles in 6.1 hours), or they don't realize that Tucson is actually further east than Las Vegas and is closer to Houston, not further away.<br>  <br>  To the person asking the question, you're going to have to give more context as to what you mean by your question.  If I were to venture a guess as to the first stat for each city, it's the approximate flight time for a non-stop flight between those cities (e.g. 1.1 hours to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco), but it's difficult to tell whether this even is what is meant by this, given the incomplete information you've provided, and it's impossible to tell what is really meant by the second stat.

uUzbqGh5aa	Well as you said, you have your son, your own place, your family and not much or no money. I live in Trinidad, and my advise to you would be to stay put and give him sometime to really make up his mind what he wants to do. I'm sure you'll still keep in touch with each other while he's here. While you wait, use that opportunity to gather up some more money and if you do finally decide to come, rent out your flat or let a family member keep it for you, that way you don't lose it if you decide not to stay. Come to Trinidad, see your options and decide if it's all worth it then. Hope it works out for you.<br>  <br>  By the way, we don't pay for school education in Trinidad, it's free education from Nursery to Tertiary. l live here and l didn't know we were in a "minor crisis" and furthermore, where are there not people being laid off in this "Global Economic Meltdown"?|`|fv2GAAdPaa	I do sympathise with you for what is happening right now to you, i can feel the passion that you have for your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I must say though that at the end of the day he is doing what he feels is better for him and i think you should do what is better for YOU and your SON.<br>  <br>  I know this will hurt and i am not being harsh at all but people come and go( men to be specific) and we cant let those things make us make wrong decisons.<br>  <br>  Dont forget that its not only you but you have an 8 year old son.

Alternatively, you can bring him with you and let him go to school here. He is young so you will want to keep an eye on him. You did not say if you own the flat.  If it is yours you can rent it out and use the money for living expenses in Trinidad. Trinidadians are very friendly people so you will make friends so don't worry.
rSq790ksaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  I have a really weak stomach too and I always get motion sick in the car so I know how you feel. However, I have been to Disney World more than 13 times and I never really had a problem with any of the rides. I recommend if you're not feeling well that day or just ate then don't go on:<br>  <br>  Hollywood Studios:<br>  Tower of Terror<br>  Rock N Roller Coaster<br>  Star Tours<br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom:<br>  Space Mountain<br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom:<br>  Primeval Whirl (may want to sit that one out no matter what)<br>  Dinosaur<br>  Expedition Everest<br>  <br>  Epcot:<br>  There is nothing to worry about there.|`|giKCTfnfaa	caribbean beach club is a very nice resort.  i'd be happy just sitting by the pools all day! <br>  <br>  there are lots of fun things to do at disney !  i don't like drops so that leaves out the roller coasters and such for me.  there's all kinds of shows to see, tame rides (my favorite being buzz lightyear), shops and food!  there's a place in downtown disney called disneyquest.  it's pretty neat if you like video games.  it's a 4 story building filled with video games, interactive games and virtual rides. <br>  <br>  if your queasy stomach is caused by motion sickness, try taking dramamine or using a motion sickness patch.  it helps a lot!|`|CWQNNJYUaa	oh man, the best rides are expedition everest (I rode that one 3 times in a row...) rock n' roller coaster and tower of terror at hollywood studios. <br>  I would NOT reccomend space mountain to anyway. It gets a lot of hype because its so old and everything....but thats exactly why you SHOULDNT go on it. Very jerky ride...makes you feel like your about to either fall out or break your back.|`|uihC5j6Laa	If you're staying at the BC, then you'll have a great time. It's a really cool resort. As far as your stomach goes, don't ride any of the rollercoasters and stay away from Mission Space (the original version) in Epcot. For more tips, check out my blog.|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	there are many mild rides at Magic Kingdom<br>  you can also go to SeaWorld to see sealife, and Downtown Disney for shopping and dinning
qLkMSEBwaa	That they are stupid.  <br>  That they are ALL great cooks..Although I am not stupid and I am a good cook, and my mom has been dead sadly since I was 13 and people still brag on her cooking, her sisters cooking sucks!!!!!!!!!!  UGHHHHHHHHHHHH  <br>  Plus, that they enjoy cooking...I'm a good cook, but, I hate cooking!!! My mom loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She would cook enough to feed and have leftovers an entire Church!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  We don't wear shoes...lmfao  I own every color of shoes they make..in flip flops  lol<br>  I admit, I hate shoes, but I wear them!!!!!!!!!  LOL<br>  You are correct about the 1st one, especially,  Although most of my family and people I know from the south are racist...I am not.  but, in defense on the issue, they are no more racist than people in the north!!!!!!!!!!!  <br>  As far as having sex, Nothing could be further from the truth or my aunts wouldn't be whores!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  There is a whole damn list I could go on about..but, I have much needed rest coming due and I'm taking it.  Have a good day!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Ps........As far as the accents, I despise the fact I have family that's been in Ohio for over 40 years and still sound just as stupid as the ones still in Ky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I admit, I have a faint accent, but greatly improved since I was 16 and saying kiss my @ss, sounding like kiss my ice...lol.  I have people in Ky tell me, I sound like a snob because my accent is too faint and I speak proper English..UGHHHHHHHH I hate stupid people!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, there is a huge misconception about southern women not knowing how to use birth control..I love my only son with all my heart, but I told the Dr. if 2 comes out, FIX ME ON THE TABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Now which REDNECK thumbs down me?????????????  I'm Org. from the damn south, I know WTF I'm talking about!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Edit.......2nd part of your question.  A huge misconception that southern people have about people from the north would be that they are well off.  NOT TRUE, they are no better off than any one else unless they are flat out rich.  Many live what seems to be a rich lifestyle, and are now losing their homes.  Granted, we moved from the south after my parents died because my 2 older brothers raised myself and my younger brother..kids raising kids..They needed safer work that paid decent.  The mines in Ky was the only high paying jobs and is the most dangerous.  Right after we moved to Ohio, one of my good friends was killed in the mines.<br>  Also, people in the north have as many prejudice people as people in the south.  What they are prejuduice against, may be different, but they are still prejudice.  You will find ignorant people all over the world.  When I first moved up here, MANY blacks/females in my school treated me so bad that I would be in tears.  I came from a school in Ky that if you didn't fight, you got beat up and being raised by brothers, no one could beat me in a fight.  But, the schools up here had very strict rules on fighting..at least for some.  If you were in a certain group/played sports, you can get by with anything, that is a fact even in my son's previous schools.  My brothers flat out forbid me  to fight even in self-defense.  But despite ALL efforts, including trying to get help from the principle against being bullied every single day by the same group of girls, NOTHING stopped it..Until, I grabbed the ring leader and beat her down and the rest never uttered a word to me after that.  To this day, that same girl will speak to me as if we are best friends and I leave her standing talking to herself.  I have no use for bullies, cowards, ignorant, prejudice  people from ANY RACE or where ever they are from!!!!!!!!!!  I do NOT discriminate,  I despise ALL @SSHOLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br>  People in the north and south...You will find people who think they are better than others for whatever reason, and I not only despise them, but refuse to allow the in my life!!!!!!!!!  Family included.  <br>  Don't even get me started on the sick assumption that ALL people in the south are perverted and are involved in incest.  THAT BS IS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just because it happens anywhere but the south, DOESN'T JUSTIFY IT and MAKES ME SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br>  <br>  GRANTED Oh/Ky isn't considered the most north/south..but it is for me because it's the only states I've lived in...But, it doesn't mean I have no friends further south/north and can't read the damn news.  <br>  Another misconception is that people from the south are not smart..when in fact, they are smarter than given credit.  My parents and their families may have had to drop out of school to get a job to help the family, but when it came to running a household, farming, canning, making the most out of what they had, instead of depending on welfare and handouts, and making clothes, not being book smart does not make you stupid.  I've seen many book smart people who have the most stupid views and misconceptions I've ever seen.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the book..but, you asked...lol|`|eGiLYNlzaa	They think we're ALL hillbilles, which i refuse to be called. I speak proper English better than anyone with a college level degree in English! I hate being steryotyped into that...And of course, i am not racist or even consider color or nationality when thinking about stuff, but my dad sort of is, and my grandfather used to be. I guess that part is almost true, but still not ALL of us. <br>  <br>  About the south-north question, my parents think that all northerns are goody-goody's. They do have funny accents in New York and stuff, but no more funny than hillbilly accents. I personally think Northerns are more open minded, but that may be a steryotype on my part?|`|DkFoX4pHaa	SOUTHERNERS:<br>  They don't speak Real American English because they drawl and slur their speech. <br>  They live only for beer, fishing and perverse sex.<br>  Their first  and middle names are BUBBA,  BOY or 'Y-BOB.<br>  Their greatest event in life was graduating from 5th grade and getting a job at the distillery or the Cotton Gin.<br>  They only wear shoes at their own funeral.<br>  Safety pins are easier to use than buttons or zippers.<br>  If there were no suspenders, their thumbs would shrivel up and die.<br>  Cars have only 2 purposes: A- running moon and B- mooning babes.<br>  Sheep are more fun than the average girl.<br>  They believe that Black people have an advantage over them at night. <br>  Mud Bugs go best with hot Gin.<br>  Pickles are dessert food. <br>  The Navy always assigns them to Mess Duty at JAX NAS.<br>  Yes !!!

gZLGhuVHaa	It all depends on your budget.   From the Arch de Triomphe to the Louvre, that's all a walking distance.  You walk through the Ave. Champs Elysees.     There are very good four star hotels like Sofitel  <a href="http://www.sofitel.com/gb/home/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sofitel.com/gb/home/index.sht...</a>      <br>  <br>  The hotel Clarion would be very  nice. It's very near to the Elysees, where Sarkozy lives.  But it's really expensive.   I don't mind staying at hotel Ibis (2-3 stars). It's clean and the price is right. Check their website  <a href="http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/home/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/home/index.s...</a><br>  <br>  I suggest to stay near the 8th, 6th or 7th arrondissement.  It's the most strategic in terms of transportation and tourist attractions.   Don't ever stay on the 15th. It's terribly "served" by local transportation.     <br>  <br>  <br>  Whole day at Euro Disney?  You can go there at 9 am and you should be done by the time it closes.  It's quite small as compared to Anaheim and Orlando.   <br>  <br>  afraidraid 3 days is not enough to cover the Louvre and then Euro Disney.  Plus, there is a very long line outside the Tour Eiffel.   It would be nice if you can go early in the morning to Notre Dame, and take the RER B  from St. Michel  to Chatelet les Halles then change to RER A going to direction Marne La Vallee -Chessy.   For the day in which you go to Disney, get the all day ticket for Zone 5 (Disney).   It turns out cheaper.   For the rest of the days, since paris is best visited by foot, get a Carnet of 10 tickets.

sAYu1JNDaa	YAY! I hope you guys have fun!<br>  <br>  OK...<br>  1) Negril is my favourite place on the island. I mean the hotels and the beaches are just amazing, i can't get enough. [Relaxation]<br>  <br>  2) Dunn's River Falls, Mystic Mountains and Dolphin Cove in Ocho Rios. At these places you can climb the falls go canopy zip lining through the trees, ride a bobsled (not on ice) and swim with dolphins [Outdoorsy fun]<br>  <br>  3) Montego Bay. Not my fav but nice none-the-less. Beaches, hotels, nightlife. [Relaxation]<br>  <br>  4) Kingston! This is where I live. People will always tell you that it's dangerous here but I've never been robbed, hijacked or shot at and I'm 19 and have lived here all my life. Clubs, Parties and Restaurants galore. [Nightlife] Avoid innercity areas and downtown. Stick to Areas like New Kingston, Liguanea, Manor Park, Constant Spring. You can go shopping, Bob Marley museum {his house}, Devon House, Lime cay beach etc.<br>  <br>  5) South coast. [Yummy Food :)/Relaxation]<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :).

Its all inclusive so you can eat and drink whenever you'd like.  You can also be shuttled to the other 2 resorts in Montego Bay.  You won't regret booking this trip.|`|xsQE3icPaa	oh yes ...u can go to Negril thats a very nice place also to swim with tha dolphins........go to dunns river falls thats fantastic....u should look in the internet about tourist sights...there R sooooooooooo many... and youll LOVEEEE it....<br>  oh if u go to kingston watch yo bags keep it as close to yo body as possible....<br>  let people whp live there tell u where the BAD places r so u dont end up gettin robbed or shot....

5CRXkxksaa	You can spend a week in Puerto Rico like this: two days in the capital area (San Juan), visiting the Old San Juan, El Morro and a side trip to the east coast to visit el Yunque rainforest. After that I’ll move to the west coast and stay in the town of Rincon (surfing & great sunsets) or Cabo Rojo (near playa el combate) other nearby town is Lajas where you can visit other great beaches such as bahia sucia & Boqueron. While in the south west you can’t miss the bioluminescence bay, it’s a unique experience. If you like mountains, then the center of PR is the place, you may want to stay in paradores such as Gripinas in Jayuya. In the south side of the island in the town of Guanica there’s a Dry forest which is a very interesting place to visit after you have seen all the different topography & vegetation of the island. Finally I’ll say that a visit to the small islands of Vieques & Culebra would be great side trips while in the east side of the island. It will all depend on your interests. Just go to www.gotopuertorico.com and you’ll get a good idea of things & places in PR. <br>  PS<br>  The food is great so dont miss it!|`|PoOKXiHWaa	Old San Juan, you must go visit it, a beautiful site.
dpKntiZoaa	Some people bank on $150-200 a day when on holiday in Western Europe, so to anticipate this for a month is not realistic.<br>  <br>  To save costs you could look at <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.couchsurfing.com/</a> or if you don't fancy that, then look at camp sites (if you have the equipment) or if not then at cheap hostels out of city centre sites <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hostelworld.com/</a><br>  <br>  However (assuming your accomodation is free and) banking on the fact that $200 = 158 euro's and so that is 5.26 euro's a day - well this means you cannot eat out anywhere (even in South Eastern countries in Europe where is it considerably cheaper).

cWLB1w1uaa	a Great beach to go to is Panama City Beach in Panama City,FL.The beach is very crowded during Spring Break(because it's known as "The Spring Break Capital of the World," due to about 400,000 college and high school students who arrive during the months of March and April.)other than that it's not crowded.The last know shark attack in Panama City was in 1979.(so sharks shouldn't be a problem)<br>  YES,you can bring animals(dogs,cats,parrots,etc.any animal you can keep under control.and you must pick up their poo poo,because it's really a law)& yes it's very safe to bring your dog(I brought my dog all 4 times I went)Some celebrities go their, but the beach is so long I personally don,t think you will spot a celebrity.This is also known as the most beautiful beach in America because of the crystal clear waters.I would say Panama City Beach is the best beach in america, and they have thousands of other things to do in Panama City(Mini Golf,Zoo,Aquarium,Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum,swim with the dolphins,deep sea fishing,Shell Island boat trip,And I can keep naming things for days.that was just a few of my favorite things to do)and on top of all that it's pretty cheap.........Thats why Panama City,FL is the best place to go.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	You know if a celebrity goes to a beach, they are MOST LIKELY not going to be on a public one. They'll either go to their private island or their own private beach. No way are they going to risk hurting themselves from people like you.<br>  <br>  If you want a good beach for your dog, then give Panama City, FL a try. As for sharks? There's no way in telling until a life guard spots one.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	If you mean in the continental US - anywhere in San Diego.  Gorgeous beaches, great surfing, fairly uncrowded if you know where to go.  Celebrities come to Coronado and La Jolla from time to time.  There was that shark attack last year, but that was a bizarre fluke and really far out in the water.  The OC is pretty good too.<br>  <br>  I think almost by definition good beaches don't allow dogs.  Dog crap and unleashed disobedient dogs tends to ruin the beach experience.  You have to go to a mediocre beach or a private one to bring your dog.<br>  <br>  The celebrities tend to go to Malibu, and to a lesser extent South Beach.  Malibu is overrated IMO, it's just celebrity housing with no entertainment.  LA's waters tend to be a little dirty too.  South Beach is packed and Florida is too humid.<br>  <br>  Hawaii and the US Virgin islands probably are the best in the US, but I've never been.  They're not particularly accessible.<br>  <br>  Australia, South Africa, and the Philippines probably top everything.
AA10806067	If I’m reading you right, you’re looking for things to do at C.O.P. other than skiing, correct?  Well, there’s actually a LOT of things besides skiing that you can do there!!<br>  <br>  You can do some the free things, like hiking and walking and just enjoying the breathtaking views form the top of Calgary’s best viewpoints. There’s a great obstacle course called the “Challenge Course”, but that may be restricted to groups only, not individuals.  There’s the icehouse, where you can learn to luge, but I believe they have temporarily suspended public access due to training requirements for this pre-Olympic year.  There’s the bobsleigh track, where you can take the thrill-ride of a lifetime!!  Only ever did it once… scared me so bad I would never do it again, but I do recommend everyone do it at least once in their lifetime!!! You could tour the ski jump tower, which happens to have the highest view point in Calgary.  While you’re up there, why not strap yourself into the fastest zipline in North America?  You’ll reach speeds of up to 140kmh over the length of half a kilometer!  Crazy!!  :o)   You can also mountain bike the hill if you’re so inclined, and don’t worry about having to haul your bike up to the top… they rig the ski-chair lifts to take you AND your bike up there!!  When you’ve worked up a good appetite, take a break and enjoy one of the dining options available, including a food court, a full service restaurant and lounge, and my personal favorite, the Naturbahn Teahouse at the top of the hill, where every Sunday you can get the best brunch in town with the most incredible views of this gorgeous city!!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|otS8Gf0laa	What are you asking?  Are you asking what else is there to do at COP if you don't like to ski?  The website lists all of their activities.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I don't know what your question is.

7Y2jmO7Taa	I'm a bit confused by your question.<br>  <br>  MacArthur Airport is, I gather, in Islip, Long Island. This is not in NYC, but rather in the suburbs outside NYC. (Some cities regard their suburbs as a part of the city, but in NYC that is not the case. If it's not in the 5 boroughs of NYC, it is NOT in NYC, not even culturally!)<br>  <br>  To do what you are asking, you would first need to take a train INTO NYC, and then take subway trains to the various tourist locations.<br>  <br>  First you would need to take the Long Island Railroad. I don't know which branch of the LIRR you would be on in Islip, but one line takes you directly to 33rd Street/Penn Station, and the other would require you to change trains in Queens to get to 33rd Street/Penn Station.<br>  <br>  In any event, once you are at Penn Station, you would need to take a subway. To go to the Statue of Liberty, you could take the Number 1 train from Penn Station "downtown" to South Ferry station, where you could get a NY Waterways ferry to Liberty Island. Or, if you just want to see the statue from the water, you could stand at the water's edge and see the statue. Or for a really great view, you could hop on the Staten Island Ferry and see the Statue from the ferry (it's free!)<br>  <br>  To get to Central Park from Penn Station you could walk just a block or so East to Broadway, and go into the subway. Take the D train to Columbus Circle. You'll be on the South/West corner of Central Park. Or, to get to a more intersting part of the Park, don't get out at Columbus Circle, but change for any local train on the track that is across the platform from the D. Take that to 81st Street. Get out of the subway and cross the street to the Park. That's a really nice section of the park! Cross there, or wander south a little bit.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	The link below show s a list of hotels near MacArthur Airport. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.macarthurinternationalairport.com/hotels.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.macarthurinternationalairport...</a><br>  <br>  From your hotel, you can take a free shuttle bus (were avaliable) to the Ronkonkoma train station and take the LIRR's Ronkonkoma Branch to Penn Station. <br>  <br>  Once in Manhattan you can take the subway to Central Park and South Ferry.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck
Dfeemjagaa	hi, i live near there and i can tell you that while yes there are some shops, they are pricey! your best bet is to taxi into Sousse(about 10 minutes) there you will find shops galore, shoes, trinkets, food, clothes. you will also find a Medina, it's an outdoor shopping area. here you will find everything from food to gold to hair ties. everything! i suggest sticking to vendors who have set, clear prices or to not be afraid to bargain them down. they up the prices and bargaining is part of the experience.<br>  oh and they have a lot of bag shops in the medina.|`|zxdEYy3Iaa	I've never been there so I am not sure.

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Sorry, but you are just going to have to save up enough money to support yourself on your visit to America.  It is absolutely illegal to work  while in the U.S. on a tourist visa or under the visa waiver program.  That car bit is simply not true.  Very seldom a person needs a car delivered to another part of the country...and pays a bonded service or person to do that...no way is anyone going to just let a stranger drive their car ...and you certainly could not legally sell it.   Absolutely NOBODY buys encyclopedias from door to door salesman, in the age of computer based encyclopedias.  Unemployment is increasing in the U.S. right now, jobs are going to be harder and harder to find..and besides, you cannot work when here as a tourist.|`|Vh29Of9qaa	You could try getting involved in some sort of telemarketing or phone sales.

If your home country is on the visa waiver list, you may enter the U.S. with your Canadian permanent resident card and your passport from your home country. You do not need a visa.  If your country is not on that list, you must apply for a B-2 tourist visa.  Follow directions on that page.  It will certainly take more than a day...depends on how long you must wait to get a visa interview.  The site will lead you thru the process.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Probably.  Unless you are a terrorist, looking to set something up in the US.  You have a passport, right?  Surely you had to have one to get IN to Canada?  You'll need it to cross the border.  You shouldn't have any problem unless the authorities have been recently tipped off about someone who either looks like you or has a name that is similar. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, they're generally fairly cool.  Where you are from, how you are dressed, and sometimes, which number person you are crossing the border, could determine how many questions they ask you.  If you don't look guilty of anything, there should be no hassles (most of that goes for anyone, no matter WHERE their passport is from).<br>  <br>  I remember crossing the border with a busload of students (many times) and having our advisors tell us not to act like jerks.  Invariably, one of the boys would say something stupid to the officials, and occasionally we would be delayed, thought rarely, because the adults were well known.|`|FvmgX0vNaa	Not as easily as a Canadian citizen can.  It depends on your nationality.  If you live in Canada and possess a passport from a country that is listed in the US visa waiver program then you are okay to go to the US without a visa, provided that your passport is machine readable. (biometric)<br>  <br>  If you have a passport from a country that is not participating in the US visa waiver program then you will need a visa.  In this case, a visa to the US will cost you, take nearly a day of your time to obtain (interviews at the US consulate) and requires some paperwork for you to do.|`|SVIDSzLfaa	Yes.... but you might need a passport.

Xkas9BG2aa	I live in Salt Lake City, and it is more diversified than the rest of the state.  I think the statistic is that 2/3rd's of Utah is Mormon....I'm in the 1/3rd that isn't.  In SLC, maybe only half the city is Mormon.  As I mentioned it is more diversified than the other smaller cities/towns in Utah.  I'm also a single woman that lives comfortably on a lower salary than yours.  The cost of living is cheaper here.  Rents and house prices are reasonable.  If you like a wild nightlife, you'll find that only in limitation here.  I find it more peaceful to live here than other cities I've lived....so for me personally it's a nice place to live.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	It depends, If you are really into outdoor sports it is a great place to live.  However, the social life in the city is pretty limited as the Mormon Church pretty much controls everything.  Most of the Mormons have lives that are centered around the church and for anyone else there isn't a lot to do, especially if you are interested in any kind of cultural events.  The salary is going to be more than adequate to live well there.

QiBBgOA5aa	Atleast in America, women don't need permission to leave the house from men, they can drive and are free to choose what they want to wear|`|AA10232243	There are different parts to Saudi Arabia. If we are talking about urban areas, such as Riyadh, I'm sure the women look upon American women with some concern in terms of taste and properness, but there is a significant portion of women in Riyadh that do not wear the traditional burkas. They wear jeans and tshirts. I'm sure they don't really think of American women and differently than themselves.<br>  <br>  As for rural parts of Saudi Arabia, I'm certain women do not even know about the existence of other countries, besides perhaps Egypt or Syria (UAE, et cetera).<br>  <br>  If you asked the average Saudi woman about what she thinks of an average US women, I doubt she would say anything tasteful about her, but exploited seems like the wrong word.<br>  <br>  On a side note, Saudi men look down upon the porn industry in the US, but still watch it anyway, it's pretty ironic.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, Saudi Arabia really isn't more sexually repressed than the US was in the early 1900's.

TxqjBQleaa	The first two haven't really answered the question properly - and I'm afraid I can't answer it much further, but I can at least correct the first two!<br>  <br>  Moss Side wasn't rebuilt after the war - the old houses were only bulldozed in the 1970s - long after the war - and the new estate built. My family lived there until the 70s when they moved out when the old Victorian houses were demolished.<br>  <br>  As for bombing - parts of Moss Side were definitely hit. It's a bit too late to ring my Dad but I'll ask him tomorrow. He grew up in the heart of Moss Side and he's got stories about some areas round there being flattened (though not the whole area destroyed, entire rows of houses were flattened, apparently). As a kid he remembers going out to the air raid shelter in the back yard during bombing raids at night and playing on the bomb sites and collecting bits of bomb shrapnel during the day. He also remembers their windows being blown in, so the bombs must have been pretty close.|`|4786d32b584fcb26c69f4fab5c440db6aa	Not bad enough - it's still there!|`|OBemKKwoaa	Don't think it suffered that much, more so because of the affects elsewhere in Manchester.

W11nQzVPaa	In Reno itself no there isn't any snow as we have been having some really nice warm and sunny days albeit windy right now. Up in the mountains it is a different story as snow in the higher elevations is a constant thing. Check with the local ski resorts to see what their base is like before heading out.

There is wonderful fishing, hiking trails and secluded swimming spots and also winter sports when the city has snow which has been quite common for the past few years.  Victoria and especially the suburb of Oak Bay are a bit like England with the scenery and the people.  Nice place to visit.|`|6igXDkkJaa	well, from an outsiders perspective, I am in my early twenties and live very close to the oak Bay High school, so I frequently witness social interactions between high school students. I have worked with quite a few people around my age and slightly younger who have grown up also in Victoria.<br>  <br>  A lot of people are very similar to the rest of people you would normally meet across Canada. Since I do live in Oak Bay (one of the richest areas of the city), I would say that there are more kids driving BMW's than when I was in school, but that's to be taken with a grain of salt there are plenty of crappy cars as there were at my high school anyways. Plus, I notice very few students outside smoking which was also different from my high school. In fact I was told by one girl that I worked with, that smoking was un-cool. I think you will find cliques where ever you go (school, work, a gym etc.) and as far as quaint goes, I wouldn't believe so. I think that kids are more exposed to real life just simply living in the city. I was walking down Pandora avenue when a guy was just holding a rock in his hand.<br>  <br>  so yeah I think you should give this city a chance.|`|KkjOXRRWaa	It's quite quaint and clicky.|`|OFdsoBjUaa	it is quaint but not cliquey. i lived there for a number of years, and quite enjoyed it . and yes it does have it 's problems. the homeless are now allowed to erect tents in pars, and the downtown area isn't as safe at night due to the drug problems. there is alot to do and see, and has alot to offer. the schoolong is fairly good, and a variety of clubs to go to at night if that is your thing. the temp is usually mild, with a fair amount of rain in the winter.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	There aren't too many people I wouldn't go on a cruise with.  I mean rooms are sold double occupancy so it's cheaper to have someone take the other half of that room than pay for a single room.<br>  <br>  A cruise ship is so big and with so many things to do.  It's not like going to the beach with someone where you can sorta expect that you two will spend the whole time together.  On a cruise I would specifically talk about the fact that I don't.  I want to lay out.  If you don't, there is so much to do during the day.  We might do a shore excursion together but we will be seated at dinner together and can talk about our day then.  <br>  <br>  The only thing I would worry about with a gay hairdresser is the bathroom.  There is only a limited amount of time to get ready for dinner so if someone is hogging the bathroom it will make it very difficult (as they are very small bathrooms).  So all your...hair and makeup routine or skin care or whatever you want to call it, should be done outside the bathroom at the "vanity" area.<br>  <br>  If you are honest and discuss your expectations, I see no reason why not to go on a cruise with any friend or acquaintance.

AA10323130	I've had long conversations with myself about this one.. it was triggered by a saying I once read on a bumper sticker.. it said: I was so open minded till my brains fell out.. it made me think because I thought it was brilliant and funny..<br>  <br>  Now.. my definition of an open minded person is somebody who can accept other people's different behavior/thoughts/opinions.. without feeling the need or urge to change what they think nor be affected.. an open minded person does NOT mean somebody with no morals.. it simply means (at least to me) somebody with his own ideas but that doesn't necessarily mean he/she has to shove it down other people's throats.. An open minded person might also believe the saying 'live and let live'.. somebody who is NOT judgmental.. somebody who knows that people are different and that variety is the spice of life.. somebody who is aware of the things it takes to make a person so he/she wouldn't blindly criticize as long as he/she didn't walk a mile in the other person's shoes.. <br>  <br>  that's what I think..|`|bf53076282d63a118b6c6376828ec305aa	it depend of of the Definition of open-minded <br>  if you mean by open-minded is to be very liberate man/woman it may be bad if u r conservative but if u r liberate too then it is ok <br>  but if u mean to be cultured and wise then it's not bad at all|`|Ul8jifyuaa	it depend on to what range open minded|`|9R8uYHcPaa	there's always a thin line separating every thing from its opposite ...<br>  <br>  open minded , yes ... <br>  <br>  loose , no ...<br>  <br>  but personally i'm open to anything , even swinging ;)|`|ravzJTVOaa	my spouse has to be open minded , ie , flexible and not rigid .<br>  <br>  he shouldnt be too liberal, ie , too unconventional  and ready to stand against traditions .<br>  i respect traditions that are part of my culture , ie respect of the elders , respect of the lines that mark morality and immorality .<br>  if my spouse obeys the laws of God in an open minded way , that would be the best .|`|bnRDldxbaa	An open mind is good .<br>  <br>  I was very important to me, & thankfully i was lucky to meet a man who came with no preconceived ideas. Although he seems to have been taught that we of the west are the root of all evil (joke), he was wise enough to trust his own judgement, which made it much more easy for him to settle here. <br>  I have found that giving him the info & letting him make up his own mind goes a long way as well, as he's a very intelligent man. Shame he had such a poor education, but thats part of coming from a poor background i guess.<br>  <br>  Too open minded is to me not committing to something, just keeps looking, not the best person to pick as he'd never be satisfied.|`|DSVUvfGuaa	To be open minded inside the muslim boundaries is very acceptable to me.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	It's not good or bad, it's essential.

b8tgCAQJaa	So am I! But these things are all around the world, not just in Newcastle. It's all the work of this very mysterious French artist:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_(artist)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_(ar...</a><br>  <br>  He's been doing it since the 1990s and has now installed many hundreds of them worldwide. If I've read his website correctly, there are 25 of them in Newcastle alone, so good luck finding them all!<br>  <br>  They literally represent "space invasion", or the invasion of public spaces. He's done installations with other classic game characters as well, like the Pac-Man characters.<br>  <br>  The reason a lot of them sprang up in Newcastle over a short period of time is because of the "Spank the Monkey" street art exhibition at the Baltic gallery, in which Invader's work featured.

23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	Have a look at www.upmystreet.com for a rough breakdown of the demographics, crime and house prices. It's a good place to start but tends to break the city into quite large areas so don't rely on it alone.<br>  <br>  You don't give a price for your property and Bristol has some huge variations for the same size of house. The differences are due to a mix of factors: safety, access, schools, public transport, fashion etc. so you can't generalise too much. Normally the leafy suburbs are more expensive than the central properties.<br>  <br>  Clifton is the "poshest" area and has the best open spaces and facilities. This is also one of the most expensive. Sea Mills is in the "second layer" of poshness but there is little in the way of parks. Unless you like golf. <br>  <br>  The district of Totterdown is predominantly Victorian terraces. The houses look bland and flat-fronted from the road but are all quite large inside (they "go back" a long way). This district was refurbished a few years ago and is now safe, clean and very much up and coming with young professionals. It's within easy walking distance of Temple Meads and Bedminster stations and on good bus routes. Some good tidy local pubs and restaurants too. There is a very large Victoria Park for the children to play in. Look it up on Google Maps for a general idea. The big downside is that it is Victorian terraces so parking is mostly on the road which means access can involve "skillful" driving.<br>  If you are familiar with the television programme "Being Human", it was filmed in Totterdown.<br>  <br>  Horfield is also very good and safe, but houses can be more expensive than Totterdown. This is mainly because the district was built about 60 years after Totterdown and they're more sympathetic to cars. There is a large open space "Filton Park". This area is slightly to the north and surrounds the A38 so access is easy. The big downside is the proximity of the aeroplance factory and Rolls Royce engines at Filton and the subsequent rush hour traffic levels. Also, there is a major Rugby and Football ground which causes congestion occasionally.<br>  <br>  Southmead is a huge estate that has some excellent areas but also some "iffy" ones. You should drive around the whole district at different times of day and night to get a feel for where you want to live. Public Transport is good.<br>  <br>  If you want a satellite town then look at Patchway or even Bradley Stoke (check this on upmystreet). This is a new town on the north edge of Bristol. It is bounded by the M5 and M4 so road access is good. The local railway station is Bristol Parkway so you can't get much better trains than that. There are houses and flats of all shapes and sizes because it was built by more than one builder. The graffiti levels are quite low so it's fairly free from yobbos.<br>  <br>  Avoid St Pauls, St Werburghs, Shirehampton, Long Cross, Henbury, Whitchurch and Easton.|`|gFRqZzY6aa	I'd recommend the Redland & Cotham area. It's got low crime rates, several excellent secondary schools (Cotham, which is one of the best in the whole city, Redland Green which is a new build and Colston's Girl's that is private-turned-academy as of this year) and the primary schools are perfectly good (I don't know much about the primaries though TBH). If you want to go private then there is Redland High which is a girls school for 3--18 year olds, with more private schools slightly further away. <br>  <br>  The Downs (a vast 400 acre area of open grassland and trees) is very close and there is a Cotham Gardens which is a nice playpark. The area can generally be classified as 'leafy suburbs'. The houses are generally large and Victorian. However, many have been split into flats and maisonettes and there are some newer houses e.g. where bombs were dropped during the war, although there aren't many of these. You are right next to the Gloucester Road (which boasts the highest percentage of independent shops in the UK), 20-30 minutes walk from Broadmead (the main shopping area in the middle of town) and cheek-by-jowl with Clifton, which also has lots of lovely shops. <br>  <br>  Basically, it's a good area if you can afford it.|`|zaepsFJKaa	I live in Yate (outskirts of Bristol) and am 17. There are three main secondary schools in Yate, all 15mins walk from one another (slightly!) King Edmunds community school, Brimsham Green School, Chipping Sodbury School.  I'd recommend Brimsham ;) <br>  <br>  Primary school wise there is... 5? <br>  <br>  The "Brimsham Park" area of Yate is very nice with it's own local shops. <br>  <br>  Shopping centre in Yate with over 100 shops. We've got a Tesco, Morrissons and Lidl, and a 20min drive to Asda!<br>  <br>  Despite not having a cinema there is a 20min drive to the mall, with a cinema, bownling, resturants etc. <br>  <br>  I've lived here my whole life and would recommend it to anyone!|`|qR9RDSEEaa	im from bristol :)<br>  well i used to live in ashton.. but i moved (long story)<br>  there's lots of schools, parks, very child friendly and reasonably quite<br>  nothing really happens because everyone knows everyone, so if your going to move to bristol that's where i would recommend or somewhere near there :)  hoped this helped and good luck :)|`|yKoqj8u8aa	The tank has good information.

We are self employed and we never had to worry about finding work and getting good contracts, well now it is getting tough, we have a lot of competition from other companies to try and get the contracts we have first bid on. <br>  <br>  Last week in Fort Mac when he was up there getting some things for the truck there were over 150 gravel trucks sitting waiting for work. That never happened this time last year, you would get the odd day where they would have to sit because of slow down or weather but now they are sitting for days at a time<br>  <br>  All I can suggest to  you is check the job boards and the major companies sites to see what they have available.<br>  <br>  Alberta is having a bit of a rough go at the moment but it will pick up in time|`|GK3oMq9haa	I think there might still be some jobs for trucking available there, but honestly right now everywhere in Alberta is suffering as far as jobs go, including Fort Mcmurray.

Take into consideration with your mortgage that you also have taxes and insurance.

ANLbWyMeaa	Unless someone can purely trace their heritage (both through their mother's and father's ancestry) back to the 'Cajun' who originally left Acadia, it would be hard to answer your question.  I may be wrong, but to me, not everyone can trace their history back 200-250 years.<br>  <br>  My mother's family is supposedly that of Cajun descent, though I honestly don't know how many generations I can go back on.  My father's family came from France and I can only trace my ancestors back to the early 1800's when the first of them arrived.  Even if you find someone who can trace back both sets of ancestors all the way back to Acadia, who's to say everyone there looked alike?<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, my brother and I have medium/dark blonde hair, my sister has brown hair.  Eye colors are grey, hazel, and brown respectively.  My skin tone is fair, almost medium.  My siblings skin tones are medium.  My father has medium/slightly darker skin, hazel eyes, dark brown hair.  My mother has fair, medium skin, brown eyes, brown hair.<br>  <br>  I have two blond haired, blue eyed nephews.  Several cousins with like traits.  People with that ancestry now could have any trait.  If I had to guess, I'd say the original Cajuns had more of a darker set of genes.  But that's just a guess. <br>  <br>  Are you researching something?  This just seems an odd, but kind of interesting question just to be thinking of.|`|4iUejzGvaa	Usually we have darker genes however my family has lighter genes but some of us tan really easily <br>  it's really hard to trace anything back that well like saying everyone from Europe is pale which isn't necessarily true lol<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|puYiHEbLaa	They are Acadians, they have a "french" sounding accent.

It is doable with out much travel stress and the cool thing about driving vs flying is when you get there you don't have to worry about having transportation.  <br>  Just make sure you give your car some TLC before you go and after you get back.|`|XD7s1VBkaa	driving is much cheaper and the road from Michigan to North Carolina is beautiful and will make a great drive. Money depends on if youre staying at the mountains, the coast, or the piedmond and how much time you want to spend there. No matter where you stay here though, its not going to be very expensive at all and NC is a beautiful state!

I mean toddlers are very young.  You wouldn't be able to see or do much with them and Disney is just easier to come back for naptime.  You can stay at Contemporary on the Monorail, come back for nap time and then go right back for the parade and stuff after nap time.  Whereas a cruise, there isn't much for them to do.  Older kids have all sorts of activities going on with the Camp program.  They can play games and activities and enjoy the beach.  Whereas a 1-2 year old really can't play games.  They just don't understand rules yet.  You wouldn't enjoy your vacation if the kid is just crying all the time and you have to spend the whole day pacing the cruise ship for the kid's entertainment.  You'll either miss your child too much or try to bring your child places like dinner where they just don't belong and ruin your tablemates trip.<br>  <br>  Disney is just far more on a toddler's entertainment level.

AA10202108	Whether it is Malta or any other airlines, the allowed baggage weight is shown in the ticket after the flight details like flight number, date of travel, class, status of ticket etc.  If it is 20K you can carry 20KG of baggage and if it is 30K you can carry 30 KG of registered baggage as free baggage. Anything above this is charged at the prevailing excess baggage rates for the destination.  The cabin baggage for all airlines generally is about 7 to 8 kgs.  If you have still a doubt please call the airline office and clear it. Alternatively, see the website of the airline concerned.

Now that her remains are in The Bahamas this will be a tourism landmark forever.
oaWrnK1Saa	San Juan is 37.37 miles from Fajardo, PR.  I would say 50 mins to an hour maybe a lil bit more if there is traffic.  I have done it 25 mins but I was kind of driving crazy and speeding, would not recommend doing what I did.  One thing I would recommend is taking Route 66, you turn left at the light where the outlet mall is at.  The outlet mall used to be called Belz, I don't remember the new name.  Route 66 is a lil bit faster  than taking the old way.  Traveling from Fajardo to San Juan there are quite a few lights.|`|AA11349832	range from 1:30 to 2:30 hours, depending on the trafic|`|2pXHcHzJaa	It's about an hour.

1FPTD5I5aa	Do you need the price of a flight from somewhere in your country to Bangkok or will you take care of that?    Different cities different prices.  A year from now the price of oil may be high or low and that will influence the price of your plane ticket.   Try to narrow down the time period that you want to travel to Thailand.   You can get some prices for flights using the airlines websites.   What city will you fly out of?  Perhaps someone can recommend an airline.  <br>  <br>  Accommodation mid range doesn't mean anything because my midrange might be different than your mid range - how much per night do you want to spend on a hotel room in baht?<br>  <br>  At the worse Bangkok will cost no more than what you spend in your own country in your capital city (Australia??)   Figure on that amount of money for hotels and you will be ahead.  <br>  <br>  Where you eat in Thailand will determine how much money you need.  If you plan to eat in the best places and party away in the expensive nightclubs you will need more money.    <br>  <br>  Here are some travel forum websites that you can look over.  Be specific when you need information, such as how much per night for a hotel, how much is in your budget for meals.   Thailand can be as cheap as you want and as expensive as you want.  Up to you!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293916-i3687-o20-Bangkok.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g29...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://forum.virtualtourist.com/forum-1943-1-Travel-Thailand-1-forum.html" rel="nofollow">http://forum.virtualtourist.com/forum-19...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forum.jspa?forumID=51" rel="nofollow">http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/fo...</a><br>  <br>  For food you can probably subsist on a couple hundred baht a day but that is eating a lot of food off of street vendors and buying your water in Seven Elevens.  You have to have some idea on how much money you will have available come trip time.   Plan on at least 500 baht a day and if you spend less so be it!   You can get hotels with air from down around 700 baht on up to over 4000 baht a night - all with air.  Smaller cities hotels may be cheaper.<br>  <br>  Spend a few days in Bangkok, while you are there you can purchase a plane ticket to Phuket if you want.  Maybe you can also fit in a trip to Chiang Mai.   Get a hotel near the Skytrain in Bangkok so you can use that overhead rail service.  Spend the last night in Bangkok so you can get some last minute shopping in and be close enough to take a taxi in to the airport.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

If you rent a car it is fairly easy to get from one place to another although watch out for the monster pothole areas that can stretch on for miles.  I have seen cars stuck in pot holes and also with blown tires.
a6JZjRG1aa	it's only cheaper if you buy fakes...<br>  the price for real is same everywhere...|`|AA11141136	China is awash with fakes in every field!|`|f9No4eRBaa	I have been to China (from Canada) 4 times in the past 3 years. I love the country and shopping but there is one thing to keep in mind. Unless you go into a high end store specific to the brand ie: Rolex, Tiffanie's, 99% probabilities the product is a knock-off (fake),<br>  If you are going to buy a fake item, it is cheaper in China than London or Hong Kong.<br>  My advise is unless you are in those specific high end stores, not to buy any items as the real product.|`|ipw5zYZYaa	Authentic items are NOT cheaper here in China as they are usually imported.  Yesterday, I took my daughter shopping for clothes.  We walked through a high-end mall and glanced at the Esprit store.  One shirt . . . only ONE . . . cost 549 yuan . . .which equals 80 US dollars (sorry, I don't know the British exchange rate).  We shook our heads because that shirt was no better quality than things we bought in non-label shops.  We ended up buying two sweaters, one pair of jeans, one denim vest and one pair of black/gold pants for 198 yuan.  Much less, same quality and just as trendy for a pre-teen. <br>  <br>  I use Chinese eye shadows, eye liner and lip gloss.  They are not fakes . . . they are genuine Chinese labels.   I bring my own Clinique foundation because I like it and don't want to have to hunt for another brand.<br>  <br>  I'm not one that impressed with labels.  After all, many of the designer labels people want are made here in China at the very same factories that the knock-offs are made.  The main difference is that they are not sold through "authorized" outlets; therefore, they don't have the same markup as seen outside of China. <br>  <br>  Happy shopping.|`|lMH2cA1kaa	Not really if you what genuine designer's items. They are much more expensive comparing to UK and US. Those items are for very rich people in China anyway; they don't care about prices. China's import duties on luxury items are also among the highest in the world.|`|kAi14kKxaa	The only place where you would find authentic stuff would be from the GST free shops at the airport.<br>  <br>  They are marginally cheaper than what you would find in UK because of the exchange rate.|`|PYTC1H4zaa	For the brands you mentioned, I don't believe it is cheaper in China. It's simply because they are not those Made in China. As far as I know, many Chinese people prefer to buy Dior, LV, Coach etc abroad (the real ones) .<br>  <br>  but coca cola, KFC, McDonald's, pantene，head-shoulders must be cheaper in China, because they are made in China also.|`|DRPThd2Qaa	It is more or less the same, the prices in China could be a bit lower but not that much. Some price adjustment might occurs in some country to cope with the buying power. Just make sure that you buy them in some respected store/mall to guarantee its originality. Buying them in HK is considered to be cheaper than in mainland China, HK is a tax free shopping heaven.|`|pWxEwmoNaa	Depends where in China you are going I would have thought.<br>  <br>  When I been over there the prices have either been the same or slightly higher.<br>  <br>  Check out the prices in the duty free outlets at the airports that you will be travelling to and from on line.<br>  <br>  I recon that will be a good place to start.|`|hot7YiVWaa	Sure, the things China sells there are cheap, but you have to be careful about the product you are purchasing. There are the fakes and the authentic stuff. Be on alert. I believe China does sell designer things cheaper.|`|pPxNypYRaa	it would be cheaper but they would probably be fake :)|`|bc672f6eb9191dfc00d1b8146c3ccbbfaa	if u did then ur never be 100% sure there not fakes...and the fakes are usally tested on animals..so steer clear

Each of them are beautiful in their own way and the citizens will tell you that theirs is the best. It all depends also on what you are looking for. Best in terms of what.<br>  <br>  As Jus Jaz said you can go on a caribbean cruise so that you can visit more than one island.  Carnival Victory has a 7-day cruise leaving Barbados and going to 6 other islands.  Alternatively you can eave from San Juan.<br>  <a href="http://www.carnival.com/find_a_cruise/Search_Results.aspx?SaveSearchToProfile=true&src=qp&dest=C&destinationText=C&minDays=6&maxDays=9&startDate=03/09/2009&cruiseMonth=March&endDate=03/09/2012&Senior=N&PastGuest=N&embkCode=BDS&portName=BDS" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnival.com/find_a_cruise/Se...</a><br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I am from Barbados so I will not say that it is the best but would love you to come here.<br>  <br>  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.<br>  <br>  When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.<br>  <br>  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You will feel its your home and will want to come back again and again to Barbados: A unique Caribbean paradise, surprisingly sophisticated, friendly, fun and always Naturally Charming!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://barbados.org/" rel="nofollow">http://barbados.org/</a>|`|daZS4jNGaa	jamaica. why? because its a big island full with fun things to do trust me you will never be bored. you can climb the waterfalls, go to rivers, see hills, climb the blue mountain which is very gorgeous. here is a tourist guide for things to do in jamaica:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jamaicatourist.net/downloads/Jamaica_Tourist_9_SinglePage.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamaicatourist.net/downloads/...</a><br>  if you donot choose jamaica my second would be bahamas because the beaches there are just as beautiful as jamaica.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	I would say Barbados or The Bahmas:<br>  <br>  Barbados:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.barbados.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barbados.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados</a><br>  <br>  The Bahmas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bahamas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bahamas.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamas</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  =]|`|PoOKXiHWaa	Barbados is beautiful and you meet plenty of indigenous people.

"Stop watching that idiot box already" When really, the person means 'TV', but just calls it an idiot box because he/she doesn't like it because it makes you an 'idiot'.<br>  <br>  In normal conversations and 99% of time time it is a 'TV', 'Television' or 'Telly'.|`|sZFA4XXZaa	Well, I call it:<br>  <br>  TV or telly when I'm speaking.<br>  <br>  Rarely "television" except when I'm writing formally.<br>  <br>  eg.

NTJwVcWuaa	That’s a great idea, <br>  Yeah, if it’s a directory, it should be organized like one. <br>  Broad categories should be appear on the home page. Food, Travel, Health, Education, Automotive, etc. Probably the best place is on the left column  where you currently have your photos or the main content area (but that may mean you change the design of the page, so left might work best in your case). <br>  <br>  See for example, <a href="http://www.sciway.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciway.net/</a> Then those links should take you to subcategories. <br>  <br>  Your google ads should move to the right column.

You will save a lot of time when you make your pages. If you have the styling on each page and you want to change something,  you will have to update every single page. Not to mention, your pages are heavier to load. With an external style sheet you only have to update that page. It’s not hard to do, let me know if you need help with that. <br>  <br>  Your pages can’t be that long. Your home page is waaaay too long. And you don’t have anchors either, which is a no-no for a long page. <br>  <br>  I would suggest bigger text. Maybe 12 or at least 11.  Also, be consistent. I don’t know why you have bigger text and italics in other pages. <br>  <br>  There are other things, but no sense talking about them until you address the main issues of navigation first. <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  This might help: <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/usability/pdfs/guidelines.html#2" rel="nofollow">http://www.hhs.gov/usability/pdfs/guidel...</a>|`|WIEH455laa	Are you talking about a directory or a city portal.

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Whether or not you need a visa depends on your nationality.  You sound like you are from the U.K...in which case you do not need a visa.  anyway, see site below.  If your country in on the visa waiver list, you do not need a visa.  if your country is not on the list, follow the instructions to apply for a B-2 tourist visa.  The instructions and links are o the same page.  If you do need to apply for a visa, you will be required to have an interview...there is no such thing as being "accepted" for an interview...you simply will have one.  It is extremely short. The ONLY thing the visa officer will be interested in is if you can show proof that you will return to your home.  You must show that you have compelling reasons to return home..owning a home, having a job waiting for you, money in the bank,.  They want to be as sure as possible that you will not violate your visa and stay in the U.S. past the date you should.

Yes, Phoenix does get hot in the winter but there are plenty of ways to avoid the heat.  Different parts of the city display different attributes of the Phoenician culture.  The downtown life is pretty busy, there are night clubs, bars, coffee shops, and just about anything you could want since Phoenix is such large town.  Of course, there are surrounding cities like Tempe, Mesa, Scottsdale, Glendale, Avondale, Buckeye, Chandler, Gilbert etc.  These cities all have a lot to offer, and they all surround Phoenix.  <br>  <br>  The scenery leaves some to be desired but there are nice views of the mountain ranges from just about anywhere in the city.  Like anywhere else these days, the job market is highly competitive as there are fewer and fewer jobs.  The crime rate varies by which area of the city.  The better areas in relation to crime, are Scottsdale, Mesa, Tempe, North Phoenix, Glendale, and other west valley cities.  Nice places to go include the Phoenix Zoo, art and science museums, Cactus league baseball (lots of them), and AZ is not too far from California or Las Vegas.  The cost of living here I would say is average.  Its probably more then N. Dakota but I think its pretty reasonable.  Phoenix is big enough to get supplies and stuff pretty easy.  With foreclosure houses on the market, you could get a nice house for less then 100k.  Well, I hope I have been of help.<br>  <br>  Another good city in Arizona is Flagstaff.  Nice weather, scenery, low crime rate, college town, lots of outdoor activities, close to California and Las Vegas.  The cost of living is very high and jobs and waiges are very low.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Give Raleigh, NC a shot. Jobs are slow there (as everywhere else), the trees are what attracts me to NC.

There will be more noise and rowdiness around town, students everywhere acting out because they are away from home.  Driving and riding our bicycles will be a little more dangerous because of the students who have consumed a little alcohol riding around on rented bicycles and scooters.  Duval Street will be wall to wall people at night.  It will be active and lively and exciting to many people.  Warm weather, sun and sand will lead to a lot of people with sunburns.  So yes, a little crazy.|`|GVyM27Jqaa	yes it is crazy with a bunch of people running around naked and bumping into poles

Washington DC is not far depending on what part of Virginia you are going to.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	There's a lot to do and it depends upon whether you'd like to stay in one place for the week or would like to travel around.  As the previous answers noted, Colonial Williamsburg is a great place to visit and you can spend a lot of time there.  Busch Gardens would be open for a change of place.  Newport News is close and you'd be able to see some museums there.<br>  Richmond has a lot to offer, also, particularly in the way of museums and history.  It also has a bit more nightlife than Williamsburg.<br>  Virginia Beach is worth a visit if you like to go to the beach.<br>  In western Virginia, there's a lot of nature that you can go see.

ioVIAewjaa	cancun is commericalized quite a bit, so i doubt you'll ever have to barter unless you want to buy from a vendor on the beach.<br>  other places in mexico, like cabo, for example, are a lot more... mexican.<br>  so.. let's say a vendor or a shop owner has their items with tags on them marked as... 6 pesos. you pick up the item, and say something like, "How about 5?" or 4, or 3, so on..<br>  and they will usually nodd and say yes.<br>  another trick is to say you will pay them american money instead of pesos. except actually pay them LESS in american that what it's worth in pesos. for some reason,  mexicans really like american money. i think part of it is because they need change to pay back american customers.<br>  <br>  and about tipping, some higher end resorts expect tips for their maids. they usually provide a small envelope on the counter or something for you to put the money in at the end of your trip. it's your descision to tip, however, because some maids might not do the best job. though most do.<br>  also, mexican bands who play during your meals sometimes expect tips. they carry around sombreros for them. :D you probably don't encounter these at home. :D<br>  <br>  another tip.. when you get into the aeropuerto at cancun, you want to get out of there as soon as possible. there are tons of mexican vendors and salespeople who practically pounce on tourists as they come in. they try to sell you timeshares, dolphin swimming, 4-wheel rides, jungle tours, etc. most of these are very pricey and you probably want to stay with the tours provided by your resort anyways, as they will be much less expensive and won't take so long to sign up.<br>  mexican salespersons are very agressive, so if they shout out, "senor! senor!" at you, just ignore them and keep walking.<br>  <br>  other than that, stay safe. especially on the roads, and when a mexican flips you the bird, they do it with their ring finger. :D<br>  enjoy your trip.|`|KdHshaX1aa	I've found that in a lot of cases the shop keepers will take care of the bartering for you. If you are looking at an item, maybe discuss it with someone you are there with or whatever, and don't immediately offer to buy it a lot of the vendors will say 80 pesos, or whatever... and just keep on going down until you commit. Just wait them out. <br>  <br>  As you said, you aren't going to get away with this at a lot of business type stores, but from the folks on the street side/beach or whatever you can pretty much say whatever as far as bartering, and if they don't like it, they'll let you know.<br>  <br>  The tipping is pretty standard, maid, bellhop, concierge, water those type of folk are good to tip. We left a little something for the maid/house keeping every day, thanking them for the job they did, but also its usually the same one or two staff that look after your room throughout the trip, so tipping them every day made sure our room was well cleaned.<br>  <br>  With reference to the airport, its definitely a good idea to get out and get everything straight once you land. If you have an all inclusive package it's likely that you'll be getting a ride to your resort with the tour provider. Around the baggage area as you are walking to the transportation there are often young guys there looking to help people with their baggage. My tip - take his help - for a five or ten dollar tip he'll grab all your stuff (even though I protested and said, its ok, I'll carry some) and take you to the right tour bus. That way there is no confusion and you're out of the airport and off to where you are going in a hurry. I'd definitely recommend it.

lcj1AKt1aa	The Global Conference was held in Barbados from 25 April - 6 May 1994.<br>  This global conference was held here to consider how small island States could face up to their special challenges. The Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States determined that sustainable development was the logical answer, and adopted the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to help bring it about.<br>  <br>  Some 125 States and territories participated in the conference, 46 of which were small island developing States and territories. As part of the follow-up action, the Commission on Sustainable Development, in the context of its Multi-Year thematic Programme of Work, reviewed the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action at its fourth session in 1996 and its sixth session in 1998. <br>  <a href="http://www.unep.ch/regionalseas/partners/sids.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unep.ch/regionalseas/partners...</a><br>  <br>  Further reading<br>  <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sids/sidstbc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sids/sidst...</a><br>  <br>  This will tell you who are the countries of SIDS.<br>  <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sids/sidslist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sids/sidsl...</a>|`|fv2GAAdPaa	The events which led to the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are examined, and provide the basis for an evaluation of the implementation of the SIDS Programme of Action.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Just walk Yonge street from lakeshore to as far as you want to go. There are TONS of independent places that have totally different stuff than the malls. Some are cheap (one place I go to sometimes is 5/10/15 for everything in the store) and some are more expensive designer places. They're really good. <br>  You could also check out Chinatown. They're stuff is usually not as great of quality, but it's really interesting and innovative and cheap. They have the best shoe stores there... Go Fresh (though I'm not sure they carry guy's shoes) you can get REALLY nice shoes for like 7 dollars.. the kind of stuff that's hard to find elsewhere. They always have great clothes. If you don't mind knockoffs, you can get sunglasses for like 5 dollars on the street there. <br>  Kensington market is alright too, but it's more vintage type stuff... Not completely, but a large portion of it is. I don't like vintage, but there are a few shops i like in kensington. <br>  <br>  Yonge and chinatown would be my suggestion though.. If your a bit "hip hop", chinatown likely will have the stuff that suits your taste and it'll be really unique and cheap :) ESPECIALLY shoes.|`|gtDvPyLKaa	urban outfitters ?

kLEpKWntaa	Well, I live in the city ranked #36 and it's a lot smaller then your city. I know it's a rough city but I also know the areas to stay out of, the people not to mess with and where not to go after dark. Drive by shootings and things like that are often targeted at certain people. I think that if you take precautions to stay safe then you most likely will be.<br>  <br>  I used to live in a very small town with like no crime. While that is very comforting it's also pretty inconvenient sometimes. You have to travel to shop, to go to the doctor, to get to school, a larger center has usually more assets then draw backs.<br>  <br>  Also people do get involved with your business when you live in a small town.

Gj4o5222aa	You could drive part of the way, and take the Alaska Marine Highway from Bellingham WA.  There is no rail service to Alaska.  There is bus service - Greyhound to Whitehorse YT, then Alaska Direct Bus Lines into Alaska.|`|FI916ISFaa	Cruise ship.  I took a submarine.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	There is no train or bus to Alaska. You are right, flying is really expensive. Sometimes you can get a web special. <br>  <br>  If you have the Alaska Airlines Signature Visa card you get free tickets and companion tickets. Just for signing up, you get enough miles for almost a free ticket. Then, you get miles for every dollar that you spend. If you are planning to buy anything big, like a car or building supplies or materials for a business, put it on the card and pay it off at the end of the month. <br>  <br>  If your children are really small, I would recommend driving all the way, rather than taking the ferry. Riding the ferry is fun, but keeping track of small children for days on the ferry would be hard on mom. And then you would still have to drive from Haines to Anchorage or Fairbanks, which takes another 1 and a half to 2 days.<br>  <br>  I've made some long car trips, inside and out of Alaska, with young children. The key is to stop and stretch every hour, even if it is just to rotate who sits in which seats. The small kids tend to sleep a lot. Bring lots of snacks, comics, music, etc. Every time you see something interesting, stop and look at it. In the summer, you will see lots of animals, birds, waterfalls, and other cool things. Take your time and make the drive part of the fun. Buy a large tent (I like the ones that you can stand up in) and stay in campgrounds. That will save some money.<br>  You can buy a copy of the Milepost, which lists most of the campgrounds, gas stations and other attractions along the highway.<br>  <br>  My mother drove the Alaska Highway in a brand new 1963 Ford Falcon with 3 kids in the back seat. The road wasn't paved then. Consider this trip an adventure! Plan ahead and you'll have a fun trip.

There used to be something called the "Weights and Measures Authority" - maybe they still exist.<br>  <br>  Try this one first - Weights and Measures Act 1985.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=43&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=2191980&activetextdocid=2192029" rel="nofollow">http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.asp...</a><br>  <br>  It might simply be the case that the weigh-scales at the airports come under the control of the local authority - there seems to be a weights and measure department in every townhall.  See guidance paper at the link below [pdf].<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nwml.gov.uk/Docs/Legislation/NAWI/INT03%20guidance%20notes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwml.gov.uk/Docs/Legislation/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nwml.gov.uk/Docs/Literature%20&%20Events/Corporate%20documents/Local%20standards%20report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwml.gov.uk/Docs/Literature%2...</a><br>  <br>  I think the accuracy of the weighing machines at the airport check-in desks comes under the control of whoever is the local authority.  So your first port of call in investigating this matter, should be Edinburugh Council - try link below - click etc. . .<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/internet" rel="nofollow">http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/internet</a>|`|Q6XYkUUNaa	The company who operates the check in are the ones who are responsible. It will also be a responsibility of a leasing company if the airline company, (eg Virgin), hires the scales<br>  Trading Standards (weights and measures department) are available if you have a complaint and they are the only ones who can 'officially' check the accuracy of any scales in a way that 100% legal for court proceedings

In beaches where there are expats u can maybe wear bikini ,same in Dubai ,Since ur an expat already people wud be gazing at you , so showing skin wud draw unnecessary attractions,u can try to show skin if ur finding it hard to get a cab, but if u need to sunbath ,u shud wear....only in beaches .|`|HUrYSp4oaa	yes that dress is fine on beaches, hotels beach clubs etc and everywhere there are expats. for malls, sightseeing etc then its better to dress a little more modestly, jeans, t shirts, rather than shorts but be guided by what u see eveyrone else wearing. have fun|`|AA10523012	For tourist it's easy to follow the "dress code". Beach wear at the beach/pool and everywhere just normal clothes.<br>  <br>  Also if you may see it, it would show respect to the Muslim society and yourself, if you would not wear a super mini skirt, belly free and boobs falling out shirts. City shorts in the city are okay, otherwise, shorts please on the beach only.<br>  Nobody will say a thing if you do not follow the a.m., but you will get attention of lots of men. Please be aware that there are thousands of bachelors who would stare at a young woman showing to much skin. You wouldn't like it at all.<br>  <br>  Have a nice trip.

Cross the street (in the same direction) , go down into the subway.  Follow the signs to the PATH system, (staircase on your ruight when you go down from the street) but them take a staircase on the right next to the Hudson News newsstand, down to the B, D, F and V lines (numbers in orange circles).  Take a DOWNTOWN D train to the last stop (Stillwell Av/Coney Island).<br>  <br>  ---Alternative using 2 trains.  In Penn Station look for the signs to the A, C and E lines (letters in blue circles).  Take a DOWNTOWN A, C or E train to W4th Street.  Then go downstairs 2 levels and get the DOWNTOWN D train.<br>  <br>  Little Italy is in Manhattan next to Chinatown<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.littleitalynyc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.littleitalynyc.com/</a><br>  <br>  From the East Side: Take the 6 (number in green circle) subway downtown to the Spring Street station. Walk East 2 blocks to Mulberry Street. OR Take the M103 bus on Lexington Avenue down to Grand Street and walk West 3 blocks to Mulberry Street.<br>  <br>  From the West Side: Take the N or R (letters in yellow circles) subways downtown to the Prince Street station. Walk East 3 blocks to Mulberry Street. OR Take the F or V (letters in orange circles) subways downtown to the Broadway/Lafayette station and walk East 4 blocks to Mulberry Street and then walk south.<br>  <br>  It is wise to take a look at the subway map online first so you can get an idea of what the system looks like BUT once you get here you can get a subway map FREE at any subway station booth.<br>  <br>  Online map:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm</a><br>  <br>  Just so you are aware - on weekends there is a lot of construction going on in the subway.  This may or may not require certain train routes to be sent on other routes.  Look for tan, red and blue signs posted in the subway stations to see if the train route you want is affected (it will give alternate routings).<br>  <br>  Enjoy spring break.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	When you arrive at Penn, go upstairs to street level on 34th street, then walk up a block (towards Macy's) and then go down the stairs into the Herald Square station where you can get the D going downtown/Brooklyn. There are subway maps in the station to guide you, don't worry it is easy once you get the hang of it.<br>  <br>  Little Italy used to be downtown (Manhattan) below Houston street by Soho, but it is mostly gone now, there are some remaining Italian neighborhoods in parts of Brooklyn.<br>  <br>  Coney Island is closed up this time of year and might be headed for the scrap heap due to redevelopment - I'd check on that before you make the trip out there.|`|abELhjcoaa	penn station is actually connected to the subway line, specifically  to get to the d, you have to walk to 34th street 6th ave and herald square to catch a d train, and for little italy take anything yellow to downtown, get off at chinatown, specifically canal street, look for mulberry street, make a left and little italy will be around there|`|d6OD54Puaa	From a Marylander herself who's been there, done that.  Penn Station is a NY subway stop in itself.  But what you want to do is go to up to 34th St. take a left and go to Herald Sq.  Take the F (orange line) train all the way to the end, the stop is Stillwell Ave.  That is the last stop.  A faster alternative is to take the Q or W (yellow line) which if I recall is in close proximity to Herald Sq., Just look for Q or W. on you way to Herald Sq.  Take this all the way also to Stillwell Ave.  Get off the train and follow the signs to Stillwell Ave.  It will lead you to the main road and Coney Island is just across the street.  You can't miss it.  When you come out of the tunnels, enjoy the ride.  You go through a long bridge.  Look into the harbor, look, look, look!...You can see the Statue of Liberty.  Enjoy, BUT PLEASE be aware of where you are.  There are a lot of shady characters around this area.<br>  If you have any questions about the subway or where you are going, just ask someone who looks like they're a Native NewYorker.  They are more than happy to help you on your right path.  Hope this helps.  Like I said before, been there, done that.  I took my 9yr. old son there for a daycation in August.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, there are two ways to get from Penn Station to Coney Island.<br>  <br>  Option 1 via Jay Street<br>  <br>  Step 1: from Penn Station, follow the directional sign to the "A" "C" or "E" subway lines (Blue Line on the subway map). Take the Brooklyn-bound (southbound) "A" or "C" lines from Penn Station to Jay Street-Borough Hall.<br>  <br>  Step 2: at Jay Street-Borough Hall, transfer across the platform to the Coney Island-bound (southbound) "F" train (Orange Line), which will take from Jay Street to Coney Island.<br>  <br>  Option 2 via West 4th Street<br>  <br>  Step 1: from Penn Station, follow the directional sign to the "A" "C" or "E" subway lines (Blue Line). Take either downtown (southbound) train from Penn Station to West 4th Street-Washington Square.<br>  <br>  Step 2: at West 4th Street-Washington Square, transfer downstairs to the "B", "D" or "F" lines (Orange Line). Take either train from West 4th Street to Coney Island.<br>  <br>  In regard to Little Italy, there are two. The one in Manhattan and in The Bronx. Assuming you're going to stay in Manhattan, you can take the #6 subway line (Green Line on the subway map) to Spring Street.<br>  <br>  If you're going to the one in The Bronx, which is on Aurthur Avenue, you can take the Bronx-bound (northbound) #2 train from Penn Station to Pelham Parkway. Once there, transfer to the Bx12 local bus to Aurthur Avenue.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful. If you have any questions or need travel directions while in town, just drop me a line by clicking on the avatar and e-mail icon in the profile. I'll be glad to help.<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your trip.<br>  Native New York

32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	It depends on a) your nationality and b) which airline you are going with.<br>  <br>  If you are a British National you don't officially need a passport to fly or travel anywhere in the UK.  (Remember, the full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland!)<br>  <br>  BUT some airlines eg Easyjet require photographic identification in which case you will need your passport or driving licence in order to travel.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	No you do not need a passport to enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain, since, as you correctly point out, it's part of the United Kingdom.<br>  <br>  Like any UK domestic flight or cross-sea ferry service, you do need a photo ID to be able to board your plane or ferry, but this doesn't have to be a passport if you're a British citizen. A photocard driving licence is fine.<br>  <br>  Note: this question is asked around 3 times a week on average.|`|SK5wHr5zaa	No, however you will need some form of photographic identification to board the flight and a passport is as good a document as any other. Otherwise you can fly from any other part of the U.K, into N. Ireland without a passport.|`|aQCTR0Heaa	I think so as it's over sea|`|uJDCoXH9aa	No.<br>  <br>  Why would you? Since you're flying from somewhere in the UK to somewhere else in the UK.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Probably not, if you are a British citizen.|`|6J6S6ECoaa	The answer is quite simply..NO|`|Jm3vMKx3aa	It depends on your citizenship. Citizens of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland don't. All others need a passport (since they would not have gotten into the country without it).<br>  <br>  For a domestic flight only a government photo ID like the driver's license is required.|`|TPVvddHWaa	Technically not but in fact your airline has to identify you and they usually insist on a passport for that purpose.<br>  <br>  Check with them if you do not have one, they may accept a photo driving license but I doubt it will be sufficient.

g05wGcPhaa	If you take the Turnpike it's about 115 miles depending on which part of Miami you are leaving from and the trip is roughly about 1 hour and 45 minutes. If you have a Sunpass the total cost of tolls would be $5.05. If you have cash only the total cost of tolls would be $6.75.<br>  <br>  Now If you take the I-95 the ride would be nearly the same time as the Turnpike. The distance is only 121 miles depending on where in Miami you are leaving from and it's about a 2 hour drive since I-95 curves around the west side of  Port St. Lucie where as the Turnpike goes straight through the middle saving time. The good thing at least is you can contribute that $6 bucks towards gas instead of tolls. <br>  <br>  In the end no matter which route you take you'll be there in 2 hours or less unless there's a nasty accident on the road. How do I know all of this? Google Maps and I've made this trip numerous times.

They would have to be able to use the toilet them selves, because in between times the carer would be free to go off on their on their own.<br>  <br>  You could try a Care Home near to where you want to go. Sometimes they take in residents for just a few days and have staff on hand to assist to the needs. Residents are often elderly but younger people who have disabilities often need them too.

I would search for it all over the web, and get it from one of the online stores that is US-based.  You’ll get more options that way. The only problem that you’ll encounter is not having a US shipping address and a credit card – I found a great solution to this problem. Check out <a href="http://www.usunlocked.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.usunlocked.com</a> -- they can give you card that gives you a US shipping address and US credit card, basically everything you need to be able to shop on a US site.

If you are stuck on just one kind of media, then you could be brainwashed by them. <br>  <br>  Israel does not want this, this is why no reporters are aloud in. Except for those reporter that are Zionist.|`|eneLtkY1aa	First, there is no such thing as Palestine, much less palestinian people.<br>  <br>  Having said that, other Arab/Muslim countries do not even allow the Gazans (terrorists) into their country (example: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, etc).  Why would they send their people to fight along side them.  The only one who sends support (not people) is the lunatic from Iran, I'm_A_Gingy_Nut.|`|fVmdmbLRaa	I agree with Beautiful Sunset, the Palestinians handled themselves pretty nicely over there.<br>  Israel was damaged tenfold and not only that but also antisemitism is on the rise here in the US, of course this maybe of the Stock market looting, since all the money stolen from us ended up in some secure personal Jewish accounts in the Israeli banks.|`|yY4AKVFIaa	All I know there have been some Iranian-trained hamas fighters, which been all eliminated, other than that they get financial support and weapons from Iran, Syria.<br>  <br>  And I agree with cher!|`|TR6OFp5daa	And risk being invaded by AIPAC-controlled America?

If anyone believes that other Arab countries actually care about the plight of the Palestinians, well, I have a bridge to sell you.|`|DTog0VZWaa	On you kidding :) - they were cheering on Israel to destroy Hamas!!<br>  <br>  They mixed in the usual "Israel is awful" commentary, but if you listen, they also didn't support Hamas, complained about Hamas & more importantly, on an international politics front, they supported Israel's actions.<br>  <br>  They did against Hizbollah too.<br>  <br>  There's another conflict in the ME that's very old, but heated up recently that's changed the dynamics completely.  Namely the Shiite-Sunni conflict is part of the ancient "who will dominate the region" conflict between Arabs & Iranians.  Iranians are NOT Arabs.  While the alliances have gotten more creative, with Shiite Iran in bed with some Sunni groups... there's a split in the region.<br>  <br>  Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon (non-Hiz factions), Saudi Arabia & a few others are afraid of Iran going nuclear & Iran's intent to take over.  On the other side, Iran has allied with Syria, Quatar, Hamas, Hizobollah (which is run as an extension of Syria's goals to own Lebanon as well.)  There is some alliance with Al-Quada in that 2nd group.<br>  <br>  So, obviously the chess game is much more complicated than the media presents it. <br>  <br>  If you keep an eye out for more indepth articles on the area this these concepts start to show up.

Once you've checked in for your flight whether on-line or in the lobby you are good to go.|`|P4q33OAnaa	I'm pretty sure if you checked in online that you don't have to do anything but check in your luggage.<br>  <br>  But to be sure I would ask when you check in your luggage.|`|285e8b302bc60e4817f5d45c744bdcfeaa	Nope,Your all set to go. When you arrive at the airport, just head through security and straight to the terminal you will be leaving out of.

PA0bGBtCaa	No, air marshalls are not on every flight. I'm not going to go into the criteria for how they choose what flights to be put on, but I can assure you that they do not have them on every single flight. <br>  <br>  It's ALMOST impossible to identify them in the terminal gate area and on the plane. I said almost, so it's still possible to pick them out if you are dilligent and know what to look for. Again, I won't get into that either. <br>  <br>  I will answer this part of your question in more detail though. Air Marshalls have COMPLETE jurisdiction in the air when it comes to any "policing". Ultimately the pilot will decide if a diversion is necessary, however, they would take recommendations from the "LEO's" who are onboard the airplane since they are on the frontlines if you will. When you have multiple armed individual law enforcement people on board, they all pre-board ahead of any other customers. That way they can meet the pilots and each other. Basically the Air Marshalls say "stay out of my way.." Even if there's a minor disturbance, the Air Marshalls won't get involved and they will let the flight attendants deal with it unless they pose a threat to the plane's safety. Unless called upon, any other law enforcement agent must not interfere.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Only a small fraction of U.S. domestic flights have air marshalls on board.<br>  <br>  No matter who is on board, the person in charge is always the pilot in command, by law (see Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 91.3). Most airlines call the pilot in command the "captain," although that's just an honorary title.<br>  <br>  Of course, the pilot will generally defer to the requests of air marshals or other LEOs, but the final authority is with the pilot, not the guys with the guns or badges.

PA0bGBtCaa	You can fly in class B airspace as a student pilot, but you must be accompanied by a certified flight instructor. When you start learning to read sectional charts, you'll see that in your class B airspace by your flight school, the "floor" of the airspace may be 2,000 feet MSL or higher. Basically that means you can fly your plane up to 1,999 feet and not have to talk to a controller in Class B airspace. Anything above the floor of any airspace and you must talk to someone, unless it's uncontrolled airspace such as E, or G.|`|ClZWgDoxaa	It would definitely be hard to learn to fly in a Class B. You'll definitely be VERY limitied in what you can do.. You should try and find one in a C or D airspace.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	If the school is truly in a surface area of a Class B, learning there is going to be a challenge.  However, I suspect that you might find that the school is actually under a Class B, but not actually in the Class B.  In that case, you can probably fly in and out of the airport used by the school without entering Class B airspace, and that's probably how things will be done.
5DnHABmPaa	I've used Priceline a few times.  I've always ended up with a decent flight, either non-stop or with one stop and never at crazy hours.  However, this isn't to say that it couldn't happen.<br>  <br>  The best way to get an idea of what your outcome may be is to search for flights through a site like Orbitz or Travelocity.  See what airline has the most flights along your route and what times they are at.  It has been my experience that the airline with the most flights is usually the one with a few more empty seats and the one that is more likely to accept a Priceline deal.  This airline is also usually the one with the least-expensive fare, and so they are more likely to accept your deal because they are losing less money, as well.<br>  <br>  So, for example, if American is the big carrier and you had no problem with any of their flights, then I would say the odds are very much in your favor.  However, if American is the big carrier and they have a flight with a very long layover and/or a flight that leaves/arrives at a crazy hour, then you may want to reconsider and book the "safe" route.<br>  <br>  I know it can seem a bit scary since you don't know the details of your flight at first, but a great deal can make it worth it!|`|AuvMZYTSaa	I've used Hotline before and been very happy with it.<br>  <br>  With Priceline there is a tradeoff with naming your own price and the departure time - there is a possibility of arriving the next day that you intend to and I'm not too keen on that
urHPuzMsaa	The pools might not be open at that time but it is possible to get a tan. The sun shines 360 days a year here and is very intense.

March tends to be windy and occassionally with a little chill.|`|URZNtrxsaa	Good Morning,<br>  The end of March is some of our best weather with Temps in the mid 70's, hardly any chance of rain and lows in the upper 50's at night. We havel already had mid to upper 80's here, but we have also had snow. Its been a strange winter out west.  That said, we can also begin to spike temps into the mid-upper 80's and low 90's the end of march.
