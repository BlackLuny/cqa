dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	The only way to get rid of split ends is to get it trimmed on a regular basis, usually about every 6-8 weeks. Then you need to deep condition at least twice a week. I use Aussie 3 minute miracle and it leaves my hair so shiny, smooth and smells good too. Before you get out of the shower do a cold water rinse to close to pores of the hair to avoid damage and also it will give it a nice shine. Let your hair air dry as long as possible before blow drying to avoid long heat exposure. Before you straighten your hair apply the hair protectant to of course protect it from the heat and don't leave the straightener on your hair for long periods. After finishing your hair, do a cold blast from the hair dryer to once again close the pores of the hair. To avoid more split ends avoid over brushing. Hope I helped!!|`|rHKW1CJJaa	snip snip|`|8F3IHGADaa	The only wait to get rid of bad split ends is to cut them off. You can't reverse that kind of damage, you can only prevent it.|`|g7SsBZLuaa	get a trim. buy ion silk drops. use a little before you dry. Get some cholesterol and do treatments. Find all of this at ur local beauty supply. No more than $20 all together for long term use!! I do it its great!|`|2Urd6VLqaa	You have to cut your hair.  Split ends do not mend themselves, or heal.  They will continue to spit further up without a haircut.    Make sure you have a good quality straightener.  If it does not have ceramic plates then it's probably killing your hair.  Also try blow drying your hair on the cold setting, if your blow dryer is equipped with one.    On products, I would recommend a professional brand of shampoo and conditioner. One that is hydrating. Redken and Enjoy are two amazing brands.  Also try a leave in conditioner. I like to use the Enjoy spray leave in conditioner. It helps my hair so much and smells amazing.  Once in a while use a deep conditioner, or protein pack to build up the strength of your hair. Sally's Beauty Supply have lots to chose from.    ?|`|7w7Q12fFaa	I know exactly how u feel....sometimes in the right way split ends can look really good. It's kinda boring when you have perfect hair.|`|fIIeI68Iaa	I no how much people hate to cut their hair but if you trim the ends every month it grows faster. When you get split ends that means your hair is dead there and it goes up your hair till the root so the more you cut it the healthier it will look and will grow better.    carrot oil creme it has no petroleum or mineral oil in it which is good for your hair and it helps it grow.      =]|`|1jt6WXUkaa	I have the same hair type as you and MUST straighten my hair, so I totally understand where you are coming from.  Your best bet is to condition your hair as often as possible.  I personally hate leave-in conditioners because they tend to weigh down my hair and make it look oily and dirty, so I prefer my own conditioning/washing regimen:  I place conditioner in my hair as soon as I get in the shower (to make it soft and detangle it), then I comb through it to get out the knots, I shampoo my hair, then I finish off with a 3 minute leave in and rinse out conditioner by Christophe. This does not weigh down my hair. It leaves it super smooth and detangled-- perfectly ready for the blow drying and straigtening. Once I get out of the shower, I put John Frieda's Frizz Ease extra stength serum (in the yellow bottle) in my wet hair to prep it for straigtening and take out the frizz. Also, go for regular trims at your salon to eliminate the dead ends. You don't need to chop inches off your hair every time you visit a hair dresser, but you should go and get  the ends trimmed.  I used to have really bad split ends. I found that VO5 hot oil treatments once or twice a month made a big difference.  Also, I sprayed a detangler on my hair before combing it. You have no idea the damage you can do to your hair when you brush it. Also, make sure you brush from the ends, up to the roots rather than roots to ends.  Lastly, DO NOT WASH OR STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! You will kill your hair and strip it of its natural vitamins and oils.
HSjKjDJ3aa	Hi,    Great idea! But, I would save yourself the trouble of buying everything and let the professionals come to you!    It's not expensive to get a mobile spa to visit, and they make brilliant parties because everyone gets professionally pampered with gorgeous products!    There's a great site called Wahanda which lists mobile spas here:  http://www.wahanda.com/spas/type/mobile-...

For that you'd need make-up (at least the basics: mascara, foundation, lip gloss, then maybe eye-liner, shadow, blusher), hair curlers/straighteners, and some pretty clothes.

r4i7xPnMaa	You don't have to use much UDPP to make it work. use the wand and get a little bit on each eyelid (if you have to re-dip the wand into the bottle for each eyelid, you're using waaaaay too much) and rub it in with your finger or a clean concealer brush. Give it a minute or two to set, and apply eyeshadow.     Applying eyeshadow while the UDPP is still wet probably isn't a good idea, because it hasn't entirely absorbed into your eyelid yet.    Hope this helps!|`|N5qx5NUvaa	You use a little and it works well. When you run out, i would recommend purchasing Too Faced Shadow Insurance though. I bought the urban decay primer potion and there was still a lot of product I couldn't get out of the tube because of the design of the tube.|`|wXloRCegaa	With U.D. primer you want to use very little, just enough for a slight coating.  Wait for it to dry before you add shadow.  If it stays tacky then you need a new bottle.|`|080934e29f274b8260654d8ae8456f65aa	With UFPP a little bit goes a long way.  It sounds like you are using too much.  You need to application about a forth of a pea size amount and rub it on your eye lid very well.  Give it a couples of secs to dry before applying your shadow, and you should get a much better result.

NpaJsM3Caa	wash your face with a blemish fighting cleanser  for individual pimples, i dab on a little toothpaste(make sure its the pasty kind and not the gel kind) leave it on overnight and just wash it off in the morn. the paste sucks out dirt and oil so the pimple goes away fast! thats my trick.|`|OtYAkRrRaa	I hate to say it but you're probably breaking out due to stress over the prom. I recommend several things however, understand there is no magic wand on this.  Stress makes pimples worse along with eating greasy foods.   Drink more water cause you're gonna need it after this explanation.    1. Wash your face and DON'T TOUCH THE PIMPLES! because the oil from your fingers will make it worse.    2. Use Isopropyl alcohol about 6 or 7 times a day. Hold it on the pimples for about 30 seconds. It will dry out your skin considerably and you will have to put vaseline on it at night before bed because you don't want it to be that dry. Don't use it more often than that because it may make your skin turn really red. After the pimples get dried out they will shrink. At this point I would:     3. Go to the store in the makeup section and get: "Cover Girl The Invisible Concealer" Look for a color that is closest to your skin tone.   Apply that in stages. Try thin coats until the pimples are not that visible. Take it with you to the prom just in case it rubs off.  Hope this helps.   :)  Have fun at the prom!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.

A good face wash is a must, and wear sunscreen every day! You have no idea how important that is. It'll make a huge difference in how you age. It doesnt matter what kind of skin you have, exfoliating is a must as well. It gets rid of all of your dead skin cells, your skin will look healthier. Drink a lot of water! And toners are great because it balances out the ph of your skin. Also what brand of makeup you use is huge! Mac is really bad for your skin. I could give you way more specifics if you mentioned any problems you have with your skin. Either way I hope this helps!

Here's a link...  http://tartecosmetics.com/|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Depends on what your definition of "natural" is, but I guess you could probably try some mineral eyeshadows. They're really pigmented and bright. I have a few from a company called Micabella (they normally have a little kiosk/cart in the mall. Nice pigmentation but a bit pricey) or you could try Bare Minerals eyeshadows. Either way, try a mineral eyeshadow, they're generally pretty nice. Good luck!|`|AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.    First off, you need to be more specific...natural?? do you mean natural colors (browns, beiges, taupes, etc) or ORGANIC? Natural would be not wearing makeup at all sweet heart!    If you mean mineral makeup, MAC makes the most pigmented mineral eyeshadows out there right now. They come in a duo, which is more bang for the buck, at $19:    http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....  However, all of Mac's eyeshadows are extremely pigmented, but not all are minerals.    I don't know of any other companies that are producing vibrant color mineral or organic shadows, but i'm sure there will be more coming soon with this whole organic craze!

The only way to get a real looking tattoo is by actually getting a real tattoo.    But the closest things to real are henna and airbrush.

70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	You shop a season ahead. When its winter you shop for spring. When its spring you shop for summer. When its summer you shop for fall. When its fall you shop for winter. So right now is the best time to start shopping for spring. Prices are lower and you'll be ready when the season start. When you shop in season the prices go up. I know it seem like it sucks. You were suppose to buy those boots two-three months ago.|`|7syjNjwhaa	Buy the boots at the BEGINNING of each season, not the middle of it. That's the idea.

It begins with the major fashion houses and trickles down to the low-end shops.  Spring/summer lines are being previewed and released now.  If they released stuff the same season it was to be used in, how could people buy ahead?  You can still find stuff, you just have to go to the clearance/sale areas.  You are lucky because you, by waiting til now, will probably pay less than people that bought boots & other winter items during the summer and fall. I always shop a season ahead.  Unfortunately, things aren't going to change, so just keep that in mind for next year. Start shopping for spring and summer now so you don't find yourself unable to find flip flops and sandals in a few months! ;)

Remember tho to go by a *professional* hairdresser..u shudnt trust any other with emo/scene haircuts !! after you get your haircut, styling is rather simple..once again you can search for styling tips on google and look at videos on youtube. that's what i do :) styling is basically straightening and teasing.|`|IwXy8KLVaa	okay i would go to photobucket and search "emo haircuts for guys" you should find a bunch of different haircuts then just find one that you like and take it to your hair dresser that should work :-)  Best of luck :-))|`|RdRsQsiQaa	Like those girls said, you should find pictures online.     But to get the style you really want it, you need to go to a PROFESSIONAL hair salon.   Like the ones in the mall.  I you do it at the cheap salons, it won't come out as good.

YaudCXUPaa	go to the hair dresser and ask for suggestions..maybe instead of dying it; highlighting it. than if you like it, you can dye it completely that color.  I have seen red highlights in blonds that look good.  But if you are looking for a drastic change, go completely red. my bf did it several years ago, and has never gone back...|`|8oHlIrLOaa	get some auburn or copper colored highlights(:|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	View album @ a Beauty Saloon, make a choice and get it done|`|GiYVrmI3aa	Go light brown.

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	A little wont be noticeable, as long as you don't pile it on. It could be a bit obvious if your cheeks are slightly blushed one day and not the next. Just don't over apply it. Also, applying blush to the apples of your cheeks (The fat parts) will just make your face appear rounder. Instead, apply it in a motion that goes from your cheek to the middle of your ear. Or, suck your cheeks in (Fishy face) and apply the blush starting at the indent and going to the middle of your ear. It's not going to make your face tremendously thinner and you probably wont even notice if it does. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc6RdHTZQqc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc6RdHTZQ...</a>|`|A5PWZgHfaa	It is not a very good idea.

The girly lesson of the day! :)<br>  <br>  Anyhow. 5 Simple tasks:<br>  <br>  1. Find bronzer.<br>  2. Find a makeup brush, or a sponge.<br>  3. Suck in your cheeks like your a fish.<br>  4. In the hollow of your cheek (space where it goes cause you suck in your cheek) put bronzer on diagnally. <br>  5. If you need help, go on www.youtube.com and search "how to contour your cheeks"<br>  <br>  Note: Make sure its a sweeping motion, dont put too much.<br>  <br>  Hope these instructions aren't too girly for you (;<br>  Good luck. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: If you put on blush , people will probably notice. And it won't help much, lol.<br>  <br>  But good luck. (:<br>  And its okay, even if people do "accuse you" you dont have any legitimate reason to have blush on, so you can just make up a good lie. :D<br>  <br>  Confidence, is the key!|`|29aa5d804359264740f072800bf47e31aa	The thinning trick using blush is called contouring and it's pretty noticeable, even on women and even when done perfectly. Its only real application is for stage makeup and photos with heavy lighting.<br>  <br>  Just don't worry about it, I'm sure you're the only one who thinks your face looks fat -- we are our worst critics, after all.|`|zGQt7sAOaa	i dont think it will make your face look thinner. lol<br>  but maybe what you should try is powder foundation. try to find some. or buy some when no one is around. in a light color. dont try the blush because you are a d00d and so you dont really know how to do makeup so if you do end up putting on a noticeable amount...then that would be a bad thing. so... if you do anything try the powder stuff. but you probably look fine just as you are. so dont worry about it. =D|`|RQdSSW7Caa	just make sure it doesnt come off in water (even if you arent near water you could sweat and it might come off) and you blend it in well or otherwise you can probablu see the line. try it at home 1st|`|Y9gsbHKYaa	that would be kind of weird, especially if you got caught using it.<br>  <br>  Drink More Water:<br>  You can slim your face by drinking more water. Your fat or puffy looking face may be caused by bloating. If the body does not get enough water, it will retain water. As a bonus, you will be less hungry and that will aid in weight loss. <br>  <br>  A healthy diet with adequate water and exercise<br>  <br>  Repeat the following exercises - hold your head back, open and close your mouth <br>  <br>  Assuming the plumpness is the result of fat deposits and not from some medical problem, one must lose weight from the body as a whole. So far, there is no evidence that fat can be removed from only speciifc areas of the body.<br>  once u trim down the body..the face will come with time. <br>  <br>  <br>  Fat face and double chin means excessive fat.control over food and exercise is the solution to your problem

zmjAccMFaa	You mean stretching your ears.  Gauge refers to the size.<br>  The smallest you can have is a 20g.  This is like a normal earring stud.<br>  No it does not hurt...<br>  Then the numbers go up by twos, like 18, 16, 14, etc.<br>  <br>  If you go to a professional parlor they can pierce your ear at a larger gauge if you prefer.  The standard is either 18 or 16 at most places.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions feel free to ask.|`|idhcqr5Daa	NEVER SKIP SIZES! ex: 12g to 6g <br>  .Going from a 2g to a 0g hurts the most. It is a drastic change. If you want, you could go to professionals and buy a 1g. It makes it much easier and less painful <br>  Make sure that you are comfortable with this change. <br>  If you go too fast, you could cause permanent damage to your ears, including tearing. If you bleed at all after a stretch, it means you have torn your ear and need to downsize (put smaller jewelry in) immediately. It takes AT LEAST a month at each size before you can move to the next size <br>  The larger the gauge, the less likely your ear will ever heal. <br>  Also note that if you gauge too quickly or up too big you will have a remaining hole. Such as going from 14g to 0g in one month, you will have a remaining hole around 8g/6g, don't do it! <br>  Consult your doctor before piercing or stretching if you have existing health problems. Stretching may not be advisable for those with hemophilia or diabetes because of potential blood loss, infection, and, due to the existing health issues, slow healing response. <br>  Piercings guns are bad. Your best bet is to go to a professional piercer, who can pierce you at a larger size if you want. <br>  Never stretch until your piercings are healed. Stretching should never be very painful. <br>  DO NOT stretch your ears with the improper materials, such as drinking straws. <br>  NEVER use acrylic jewelry in a freshly pierced/stretched hole. Acrylic harbors bacteria, inviting infection. Acrylic jewelry in not appropriate until your piercing is fully healed. <br>  Wait until your piercing is healed before wearing double-flared plugs or tunnels. The flare causes them to be a little larger in diameter than their measurement indicates and inserting one will actually involve another slight stretch. <br>  Double flares are not good for new gauges because your ear may heal around it, and to remove them, you may have to rip them out, which can cause tissue damage. <br>  DON'T let anyone stretch/gauge your ears for you, unless it is a professional, at a store/shop, you should be comfortable, and go at your own pace. If you are afraid, don't do it, the effects can be permanent. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|zGQt7sAOaa	well i have 1/2s<br>  and the smallest to stretch is generally 18g<br>  the really small ones dont hurt as much as the bigger ones because the smaller they are the less you stretch, but generally when you get up to about 2, then it starts to really hurt. the 1/2s where the worst for me! such a big jump from 7/16!|`|0gONjiSzaa	The smallest size is typically 20 gauge, what a normal earring would look like. And no, it should never, ever hurt. If it hurts, you should stop because you're likely damaging your ears.|`|6kP1UeMLaa	smallest size is 20 and that's the size of a normal earing, then it gets larger by lower numbers. you can go up to 18 easily.|`|z3uUtr33aa	like a 20g that's extremely small. it's probably what you have in your ear now if you have your ears pierced and the next smallest size is a 18g which is a waste of time and money to buy tapers and jewelry for a whole that small. the smallest most reasonable gauge is probably a 10g. look it up and see if you like the size.

Losing up to 100 hairs a day is normal. <br>  <br>  But if hair loss runs in your family, you could lose a lot more hair. Over time, you may end up with bald spots or hair that slowly gets thinner. About half of all people have this type of hair loss by around age 50.1, 2<br>  <br>  Other factors, such as diseases and medicines, also can cause you to lose more hair than normal.<br>  <br>  Although hair loss is fairly common, it can be a tough thing to live with, especially when it changes how you look. But there are ways you can treat your hair loss.<br>  <br>  What causes hair loss?<br>  Common causes of hair loss include:<br>  <br>  Heredity. In most cases, hair loss is inherited, which means it’s passed down from one or both of your parents. This is called male-pattern or female-pattern hair loss. <br>  Stress, including physical stress from surgery, illness, or high fever. <br>  Chemotherapy, which is powerful medicine that destroys cancer cells. <br>  Damage to your hair from pulling it back too tightly, wearing tight braids or ponytails, or using curling irons or dyes. <br>  Age, since you grow less hair as you get older. Hair also gets thinner and tends to break more easily as you age. <br>  Poor diet, especially not getting enough protein or iron. <br>  Thyroid diseases, like hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. <br>  Ringworm of the scalp, which is common in children. <br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  Your symptoms will depend on what kind of hair loss you have. <br>  <br>  If your hair is thinning, it happens slowly over time, so you may not notice the hairs falling out. If your hair is shedding, then clumps of hair fall out. You may lose hair all over your scalp, which is called general hair loss. Or you may lose hair only in one area, which is called focal hair loss.<br>  <br>  With inherited hair loss, men usually get bald spots around the forehead or on the top of the head, while women have thinning all over the scalp. <br>  <br>  See a picture of typical inherited hair loss.<br>  <br>  Since your hair has a lot to do with your appearance, losing it may cause you to have lower self-esteem if you don't like how you look. This is especially true in women and teens. <br>  <br>  How is hair loss diagnosed?<br>  Your doctor will ask you some questions, like how much hair you're losing, when it started, and whether your parents have hair loss. He or she will look closely at your scalp and hair-loss pattern and may gently pull out a few hairs for tests.<br>  <br>  If it’s not clear what’s causing you to lose your hair, your doctor may do a blood test or look at a sample of your hair or scalp with a microscope.<br>  <br>  How is it treated?<br>  How you choose to treat your hair loss depends on the cause. It also depends on your feelings. You may decide that you need treatment, or you may not be worried about thinning hair or baldness. The choice is up to you.<br>  <br>  Hair loss that runs in the family can be treated with medicines or with surgery, such as a hair transplant. Some people choose to wear hairpieces, like wigs or toupees (say "too-PAYZ"). Finding different ways of styling your hair, like dyeing or combing, also can help. If hair loss is caused by something you can control, like stress or medicines, you can treat it by getting rid of the cause.<br>  <br>  When you are deciding about treatment, think about these questions:<br>  <br>  Which treatment is most likely to work? <br>  How long will it take? <br>  Will it last? <br>  What are the side effects and other risks? <br>  How much will it cost, and will insurance cover it? <br>  Will your hair grow back?<br>  When your hair loss is inherited, your hair won't grow back naturally. Treatment can help some hair grow back and prevent more from falling out, but you probably won't get all your hair back. And treatment doesn't work for everyone. <br>  <br>  When medicines, stress, or hair damage cause you to lose your hair, it often will grow back after you take away the cause. If this doesn't help, you may need other treatment. <br>  <br>  If you're unhappy with how hair loss makes you look, treatment may boost your self-esteem. It’s natural to want to like the way you look. <br>  <br>  But keep in mind that treatment, especially medicines and surgery, can have some side effects and risks. Be sure to discuss your decision with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Frequently Asked Questions <br>  <br>  Learning about hair loss: <br>   What is hair loss? <br>  What causes it? <br>  Can I prevent hair loss? <br>  What are the symptoms? <br>  What happens in hair loss? <br>  What increases my risk of losing my hair? <br>  What is alopecia areata? <br>  Who is affected by hair loss? <br>   <br>  Being diagnosed: <br>   Who can diagnose hair loss? <br>  How is it diagnosed? <br>   <br>  Getting treatment: <br>   How is hair loss treated? <br>  What medicines do I need to take? <br>  Will I need surgery? <br>  What other treatments might be recommended? <br>  Should I take medications for inherited hair loss? <br>  What do I need to know about hair transplant surgery? <br>   <br>  Living with hair loss: <br>   What can I do at home for hair loss? <br>  How often will I need to see my doctor? <br>  When should I call my doctor?|`|mAcRAo5Uaa	oh my goodness.

nAwqrAqDaa	Because you do not have sweat glands on your knees or elbows at such a scale as the rest of your body, they tend to be the most dry areas of your body. This often makes the skin turn darker over time, unless properly moisturized. My best advice is to apply some moisturizer to them one half-hour before using the self tanning lotion. This should be done in steps, though:<br>  <br>  1. Soak a rag in hot water, then place it on the knee or elbow of your choice for about 5 minutes until the pores are opened. Repeat for the rest of the body.<br>  2. Apply a natural moisturizer such as Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, rubbing it into the pores for a good 30 seconds.<br>  3. Wait for about 20 seconds for it to somewhat dry/soak in, then gently pat off some of the excess lotion.<br>  4. Wait for at least 10 minutes before doing anything with the spray tan lotion. This will ensure that your skin is properly moisturized.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	You can either avoid putting it on those areas or mix it with a lotion to make it go on more smoothly and also even it out.|`|lgTHnW7Baa	You eally should avoid using sunless tanner on these parts of your body.  The skin is a lot less smooth and more porous.  You can try exfoliating these areas before putting the tanner on.  Use a mixture of salt or sugar, a little baby oil or body oil and just a little bit of soap.  This should help just a little bit.|`|LfFdQwcdaa	Use lemon juice on elbows and knees.

4vXZbvgSaa	Do you mean you have straight across bangs? if so, you can soften them up with just a pair of shears.

qdpLoiiSaa	First use a neutral base then in the crease of your lid use a brown eye shadow and then use black eye shadow as an eyeliner (which means that it will look softer and a thicker line). I am half American and half Afghan and this is how I do my makeup.|`|5ifgrIp4aa	Use darker make-up. Liquid eyeliner will help with this a lot.|`|Juzpn1Kqaa	armenian isn't middle eastern it's european. but anyways, most middle eastern women have VERY thin eyebrows, and wear a lot of make up. look up people like maryam fares, haifa wehbe, nancy ajram, najwa karam.. etc and see how they do their makeup.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Armenians Rock!|`|XYBHM8aSaa	Wear a burka

I don't think i've ever liked a mascara so much. It does wonders. I think its the volume and length one|`|6aEhPcDAaa	Hmm.....<br>  <br>  The only one that I have actually tried is the XXL XX-treme length, and it is pretty good.  The primer works very well, and so does the regular mascara.  As for how long the tube lasts, it lasts a pretty decent amount of time.  Of course, since it is double sided, and the tube can only be so big, so there can only be half of each amount of product from what there would be in a regular tube.  I hope that makes sense.  So, it does last a bit shorter than regular mascaras, but not like its going to be gone in the first two weeks.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|JYQ6M5xmaa	i say go with covergirl lashblastt. it's the best. the fat orange mascaraaa, ah its amazingg!|`|Pznw9kEvaa	I don't know the name of it but I use the somewhat new lime green one.

pRXejsdXaa	rite now im in my 7th week of Dans regimen and its giving me very good results(im almost clear). This stuff works a whole lot better than Proactiv. if you do try it i suggest you buy some jojoba oil because your face can get dry and flaky. Here is a "does the regimen work?" poll <a href="http://www.acne.org/regimen_poll.php?action=viewresults&anchor=poll" rel="nofollow">http://www.acne.org/regimen_poll.php?act...</a> check it out. I strongly suggest people who have trouble with acne try this stuff. The starter kit is 34 dollars so i think its definately worth a try!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	yes it does, my older sister used it to a great result. But the best product out there according to her is the Acne Stop Powerful Salicylic Acid Peel. I think it's by Original Skinstore or something like that. I remember her using the liquid and literally having her cysts, blackheads and all those suckers gone in a week. I use some too when ever I get bad breakouts around my chin area, and it's amazing. only it stings so bad everytime I literally hop and dance in the restroom everytime I use it.<br>  oh yeah, one more thing. I suggest going on Makeupalley.com to see reviews about skin care products if you decide to buy something.

4vXZbvgSaa	Temporary color is a LOT of fun, but the process to get it will not be reversable. Once you bleach your hair, your natural color is gone, and it will have to grow out, even after your temporary color is gone. I recently dyed a lot of my hair pink, and even after I dyed over the pink and bleached hair back brown, the other color still shows through a little bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  You all have dark hair, so go to a beauty store and buy a bleach product like "White Lighting" or something the same. A 20 vol product should do the trick. Put the bleach on the parts of your hair that you want to lighten, and foil the hair. Keep a heat source on the foil, to accelerate the bleaching process. KEEP CHECKING THE HAIR. You want it to turn a yellowy color, like the inside of the banana. Don't let it turn white, or else the temp color wont stick.<br>  <br>  After your hair is bleached, wash your hair. Apply the pink to the light hair, and let it sit. Rinse with vinegar and cold water to lock the color... don't shampoo for 24 hours. <br>  <br>  And... You're done =]|`|Qkg98XtHaa	you can get a feria hair color that is made so you can do the pink highlights yourself <br>  its available at walmart but not on the site|`|9X7YBQl3aa	Just some advice, don't ever bleach your hair.<br>  It drys out your hair, and your hair will look like crap.

If you can't handle a little pain in your ear lobe then you probably don't really want gauges after all.|`|lSD3BgyCaa	i agree with kendra. its how i stretched mine. if you switch gauge sizes in order and dont skip any, the pain will be minimal. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE make sure you sanitize any earring youre using before putting it in. your ears could get infected. also, if youre allergic to anything, dont wear that particular thing because you may break out. like i did. how big are you planning on going? have fun!

SQnrkvstaa	Eat healthy, exercise, drink 6-8 glasses of water, massage your scalp daily for a few minutes, get trims every 6-8 weeks, deep condition every 2 weeks if your hair is in normal condition [do it once a week if your hair is severely damaged] and keep your hair as heat and chemical free as possible [if they're a must, only use heat products once a week and chemicals every 6-8 weeks].

tgCNwQ2Saa	use an underarm whitening lotion or any deo that have whitening chemicals(like Dove)...|`|idhcqr5Daa	Spray it on. Find an old spray bottle, and put lemon juice in it. If you want, add some water. Spray it on your skin. <br>  Rub it on. Rub a lemon rind over your skin. It cleanses the skin. <br>  Use it to "wash" your face. Splash it onto your face in the morning the same way you'd use water to wash your face. Drink a glass of water with lemon juice and honey in early morning. <br>  Put on sunscreen when going outside. Wash your face with lemons every night. Lemon juice is an acid. Depending on your skin type, it may react with the sun to cause blisters. If it does, dilute the lemon juice with an equal amount of water, and always wash it off afterwards. <br>  Watch out for your eyes! <br>  Do not go in the sun while there is lemon juice on your skin. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|wnyuH0aTaa	A torch.|`|0C8lOe6Faa	you can get the dove deodorant and that works after a few weeks of use you will see a difference

6aEhPcDAaa	Well, those site model girls use A LOT of Photoshop in their photos, so I can tell that that whole photo, including the eyeliner was partly fake.  However, it looks like she smudged her eyeliner a bit, but in a good way.  So, how you would go around doing that would be:<br>  <br>  -Put on the eyeliner all around the eye, try your hardest to not smudge it.  If its just not working, here is a tutorial on how to put on eyeliner easily.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRgHR8b6cUk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRgHR8b6c...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  For the lips, do a light pink lipstick, with just a tiny bit of gloss on top of it.

rGfmCZM8aa	or, a much simpler way, put a bit of lotion in your hair. Dab about a quarter size in your hand, rub your hands together, and flatten it over your hair. It works because you can also control the smell of it. And you don't have to worry about bringing a dryer sheet to school, most people carry lotion. To get rid of static all over, take a bit more lotion and kind of comb it through your hair. It works wonders. And usually lasts the whole day as long as you don't play with your hair much. But if it gets static-y again, just apply more. <br>  best of luck. :]|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Mist it lightly with water... -For SOME reason, the static cling isn't as Bad- even AFTER your hair dries...  ;)|`|BtK9nSalaa	take a dryer sheet like Bounce and just pass it over your hair. straightening hair makes it quite staticty too.<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219180026AAhdDjP">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|tLrJhDfKaa	Take a dryer sheet and run it over your hair.

idhcqr5Daa	Try blue. Blue is a very common eyeshadow color. Blues are all about being noticed, not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop. <br>  Consider silver/gray. Silver/gray brings on heavy metals and drama. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with blue or brown eyes. <br>  Put on brown. Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown eyes and hazel or light brown eyes depending on the shade of brown. <br>  Be careful with green. Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of springs best colors, it looks wonderful with Light brown or blue eyes. It can also be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the wicked witch of the East! Be careful and sparing in adding it. <br>  Add some purple. This was the spring of 07's signature color but it looks great in any season when done well. It looks awesome with brown or green eyes. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|eMZthQnKaa	well, i have dark browned eyes, dark dark brown hair, but i am light skinned. So i usually  wear neutrals and purples. u can even try going 2 the store and finding eyeshadows that enhance your eyes.|`|SolKr1Amaa	I have the same problem, i was sick of the same colours that made my eyes look plain.<br>  The best colours for your eyes is a light pink/purple,dark shimmery brown, and a really light whitish colour. Those colours really bring out your eyes!  with those colours, apply the pink/purple on you eyelid up to your crease(line on your eyelid), the dark brown will go on your crease , and the white colour will go above the brown and up to your eyebrows. OH, and a brown mascara will work perfectly to bring out your eyes.<br>  You'll be getting tons of compliments on your eyes! Trust me :)\<br>  Good luck!|`|3EBGykXEaa	any color of purples, pinks, light creams and neutral tones. you can mix and match and try out different eyeliners along with it. if you need help learning how to put certain shades on properly you can go to youtube and type in "smokey eye" or "how to do eyeliner" that kind of thing. good luck!!!!|`|8x0oe23aaa	<a href="http://www.vuneacosmetics.com/products/images/eye-shadow-dark-brown.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.vuneacosmetics.com/products/i...</a><br>  that should be a perfect color for u.|`|A5PWZgHfaa	Try shimmery browns and bronze colors.

F3FblS6Haa	use luke warm water and buy a facial cleanser. just use your hands and don't wash it more than twice! it'll dry out your face, causing your skin to produce more oil than it needs and you'll end up breaking out|`|nftcTLXKaa	lol i kno it can be confusing but they just basically mean to wash with warm water and a facial cleaner.. dont wash with soap cuz often it dries out skin instead of moisturize.. or it can also make skin rlly oily depending on ur skin type and different ppl. u can just use ur hands. this is the brand i use: Cetaphil. there's a lotion too. i bought the lotion and the cleanser (facial wash). it says "mild" so even if it gets in ur eyes it wont burn. but soap will defineately burn dont use soap. just put some on ur face and rinse it off. its that easy. i bought mine at walgreens. u can get it at any drugstore. remember: Cetaphil facial cleanser. u can buy the lotion if u want. u can also buy it at any drugstore. good luck!! :D|`|dBPCT41kaa	You want to use warm water.<br>  Dont use a washcloth because it will rub your skin so its better to use your hands<br>  You should find a face wash instead of soap<br>  And each time you wash it, you want to wash it 2 times if you wear make up. If you dont wear make up then 1 time 2 times a day should be good. And if you wash it more, depending on the face wash you use, you could dry out your skin a lot and that wont feel good. So read the recommended usage. Especially if it is a strong wash.|`|bBX98ZnGaa	well, it's always good to first splash your face with warm water first (to open the pores) and then finish with cold water (to close them). you can use your hands, so long as they aren't too dirty. Types of soap depend on what you want to accomplish. Do you want to rid your face of blackheads, acne, or just a simple clean? Try neutrogena or clean & clear. And make sure that you get a wash that is tailored to your specific needs. Secondly, make sure you wash your face at least once a day, twice is fine, but more than that will significantly dry your face out. lastly, using a moisturizer from clean & clear or something like that will help out will smoothness.|`|HdOVYIWjaa	I'm not sure the "proper" way to wash your face, but I use lukewarm to warm water, I use my hands to gently later the cleanser on my skin, I use aveeno facial cleanser (its the most gentle and non irritating) and I only wash my face twice a day, any more can strip the natural oils from your skin.  I wouldn't recommend using a product labeled as "soap" for your face, it can dry out your skin and irritate it.|`|gKegXKaSaa	1) Start with warm water to open your pores, switch to cold water at the end to close your pores.<br>  2) Hands are OK, but a wash rag will exfoliate your skin.<br>  3) Of course use soap, use one that is made for your skin type, not regular bar soap.<br>  4) I wouldn't wash your face more than 3 times a day, you may dry it out.

JrLyMfDdaa	its probably too early to tell.  you might not swell right away, so give it some time (and general aggravation) and you might be appreciating the extra room on the bars.  no matter how unsightly or annoying, i'd recommend not changing the jewelry for 6 weeks to prevent irritation and infection.  piercings heal from the outside in, so even if the skin seems healed and good to go, chances are high that inside the lip is still open and ripe for infection.  that being said, try not to play with them too much at first, and don't move or turn them a lot.<br>  get used to them rubbing your teeth, it will feel less weird after a few months, and its all healed and you have proper fitting jewelry.|`|slppTZi1aa	I think one of the reasons your noticing so much is because you just got them, the feeling generally goes away as you get used to it. I had mine pierced at the very top of the lip, and it always felt longer at first because mine didnt swell very much the first day either, it swelled the second day. If you got it done professionally and you like where the postitioning is when you look at it then dont worry about it, youll get used to the feeling.|`|KqBlgD6Xaa	The position is wrong.<br>  you should feel them on your gums. or not at all.<br>  try getting a shorter stud and if you still feel it on your teeth then yeah.<br>  they were peirced wrong.|`|AN2svreQaa	I also have snake bites....its cause your lip will swell and take up the whole stud....wait till tomorrow....do not change them for 90 days|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	wait, are you getting really getting a real snake to bite you??|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	yeah its cuz they are long. after they heal switch to a shorter bar so they dont rub against the teeth/ gums as much|`|09X3ozvzaa	I think it is due to the bar, but you probably need the bar pretty long since your lip will be swollen, but as soon as you are allowed to change the bar, I would suggest getting an acrylic bar, so it will protect your teeth whether or not it's supposed to be that close to your teeth or not.|`|sfYsac5Vaa	It can be either thing.  Think back to what the person who pierced your lip said.  In 24 hours, if it's still like that, go back and ask what's going on.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	It's because they are long, they might rub against your teeth all the time though, mine used to.|`|AA11725952	well it is because of the bar once you get that shortened it wont be rubbing as bad...

But then again a darker room can seem more peaceful, but I still don't think it's the best.<br>  <br>  Room 2: 3 I think this is a very good room for a couple. It's nice and peaceful and i think you could make it look really nice especially if you had a elegant but poppy color on the wall. That just seems like the best choice for your situation :)<br>  <br>  Room 3: 2 This room also gives off that teenage vibe. I think the purple is almost too loud. It ruins the peacefulness of the black. It also doesn't give as much variety with decorating as Room 1 and 2 do. like room 1 you cud add a few red pillows to make it a lil more fun. and in Room 2 you can add light blue pillows or something to give off a peaceful cloud thing lol you know... so all and all i think Room 2 is the winner :D|`|yuT6tqXraa	well,it depends on your and your fiance's personality.If you guys are kinda dark and creepy then room 1,but if you guys are perky and upbeat the i would go with room 2,but if you guys are very contemporary the go with room 3.But if you are not really and of the above personalities then you could always decorate a room around a favorite painting or something,like my mom and dad decorated their room around vincent van gogh's the stary night|`|8716lmYLaa	my two favorites are room 1 & 2<br>  <br>  room 1 - kind of dark, simple, masculine room <br>  room 2 - neat, fresh , clean <br>  room 3 - kind of trendy , feminine <br>  <br>  <br>  but my favorite is room 2 .<br>  is both feminine & masculine .<br>  its perfect for a lovely couple that likes clean, fresh styles .<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck choosing and decorating your bedroom .<br>  <br>  hope this answer helped <3|`|SnqsDt1Caa	Room 1<br>  <br>  is wayyyy to dark u might regret it later i think<br>  <br>  room 2 <br>  <br>  is the best i think you should trow in some dark items but i like it the best cause its more grown up<br>  <br>  room 3<br>  <br>  looks like a highschool/middle schoolers goth room<br>  <br>  ROOM 2 ALL THE WAY =]|`|uAzToWC7aa	3 is the best<br>  #2 is the second best<br>  #1 is too dark and saddening|`|NjL6UlRwaa	i like all of them but i think room 2 looks the best,it has a victorian look to it.|`|qYTYcVGGaa	Ok the sex would be better in room 1- im just gonna say that. the colors aree very sexy so go with room 1|`|IBqjTKfWaa	the pictures don't show up...|`|ZJIIHYqyaa	ok so the first one i think would be a little too dark and would feel like a dungeon when you walked into it. It wouldn't really be somewhere you could feel happy and a place you could go to relax. The second one i fell is too light. You would want to change it after a couple weeks/months. The third one is the best of the three but maybe change the black to a more light color. Maybe gray. Or if you wanna completley change it you could do purple and maybe a pale blue. That would be adorable. But if you have your mind set on one of the three then the third one for sure. hope i helped and good luck =]|`|16o6qrtdaa	room 1: cute but a little to dark. i would add some color to it.<br>  room 2: nonono. it is WAYYY to white! that would get very annoying after awhile! and it looks like a wedding.<br>  room 3: very cool and fesetive. out of all 3 i would choose that one. but purples my favorite color so i might be a bit biast. but the zebra and purple go really good together!<br>  <br>  advice: put some variety of color into the room. from what you made it looks like your only doing 1 color. you should do alot of colors that all go together.<br>  <br>  good luck with your room!|`|VXeJ550laa	I actually thing a balance between one and two would work perfectly and then you can have the best of both worlds.  You could paint the walls something from the dark taupe/gray family.  Vespar has some fantastic color families that will work.  Then you can hang your flat screen and accent with clear glass to bring in light.  Some clear glass lamps would look cool.  They have tons at TJ Maxx homestore.  Then you could get a modern white bed with fluffly white bedding.  For the bedside tables you can go with the mirrored glass chest on one side and maybe like a hand painted piece or something.|`|MGp3asPTaa	Room 2 is amazing! i rate it a 3.<br>  Room 1 i'd rate it a 1.5.<br>  Room 3 is pretty, but keep in mind your husband sleeps in there too. so i'd rate it a 2.<br>  <br>  ROOM 2 is the best because it's perfect, romantic and its not TOO feminen. plus it's totally right if you guys are about to get married. love is in the air, and its' really cute xD i love it|`|rHQbWHnSaa	the first one is best. <br>  the second one is just too WHITE and you probably don't want bright colored walls. otherwise: white overload!!<br>  the third one is a little more like two-girls-out-of-college-who-have-their-...     <br>  the first one looks very chic but i think it works with other dark-colored furniture. but make sure not to overload on one color/theme.|`|AnSFRCnraa	Number one is ok but way to dark I give it 2.<br>  <br>  I like number two the best, its very cute and its not to dark so i give it a 3.<br>  <br>  Number three, looks like a little teenagers room I give it a 1.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go with number two.I hope everything works out with you two and I hope my answer helps :).|`|yUpHZwTMaa	1.. is way to dark it could still be naughty but still need a little color..<br>  <br>  2. its really cute and i lov eit but i think it would make me feel like being in a hospital room or something... just beucase its all white.. other than that i love it!!!<br>  <br>  3. i love it.

WwQ1y5TMaa	When your hair wet comb knots out and spray in a leave in conditioner and a little soft hold hairspray. Get a hairdryer and with a paddle brush, brush all your hair back like your going to put it into a pony tail whilst following the brush with your blow dryer, once all your hair is dry, carefully brush all your hair back into a mid length ponytail with an anti snag elastic but leave a bit out. With the bit your left out twirl it around the elastic so that it covers the elastic and pin. Carefully bobby pin the sides to ensure no layers will fall out and place a head band on top for extra security (and it looks really cute) hairspray again. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|QVtE5w2qaa	just wash your hair at night instead before you go to bed, then let it dry when you sleep when you wake up it will be smooth and put it in a ponytail!|`|def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	i dont think it's cool to go throwing around words like "Retard" k? it's rude and offensive.<br>  <br>  the only way to have a perfect pony tail  is to practice.<br>  use a comb and brush from your bangs back while gathering it.<br>  if your hair is layered it's probably not going to stay in the pony tail and if bobby pins and spray doesn't work than thats just the way things are.<br>  <br>  most girls don't have perfect pony tails anyhow they normally have hair around their face.
h0wDABGbaa	no, you can get them for $60 or so.<br>  and make sure you get the epilators, not the normal shavers. normal shavers make your hair grow back faster because its only shaving the top bit of the hair off whereas epilators pull out the hair including the root.

Any tan consaultant can refure you to good skin treatments.

Ii0PpO8naa	I have, and I currently am taking Biotin, which is basically the same thing.  My nails already grow fast to begin with, but they seem to be growing even faster and haven't been splitting like they usually do in the dry winter.<br>  <br>  As for my hair, I think it's growing a little faster, but it's hard to tell.  It doesn't make your existing hair any different because the hair that is already hanging out of your head is composed of dead cells.  But the hair growing in should be healthier.|`|CJu38cmnaa	i take biotin as well and my hair seems to be growing a little bit better because i dont cut or trim it either. though it's been a couple months.|`|7SNPAJm4aa	I was actually thinking about buying this. I've done some reserach about it online and it's quite popular, but some people say they've gotten pimples from it and decided to stop. It has biotin in it, so I'm guessing that was what caused the pimples or maybe one of the things that caused it (I'm not sure what else is in the bottle, so I can't say what else in it can cause possibly them), but I do know that biotin causes pimples in some people. Some take it and get pimples while others do not. I've taken biotin and gotten them, and had to stop, so I know from experience. People say if you take it with vitamin C, you shouldn't get them and I did, but still got them, those massivver pimples too. So I'm glad I found out that the hair, skin and nails multivitamin can cause them as well before I bought them because it would have been a waste as I would have to stop. I'm sad I had to stop taking biotin because it did work. I saw a big difference in my hair withn days of taken it as far as thickening goes. And I'm sure the hair, skin and nails vitamin has all the other good vitamins for hair, so it'll work great. Give it a try and see how it goes. I'm still considering getting it, if I can find a way to stop the pimpels from coming. Good luck
NiPuaY0Saa	dont do it..my friend did and her ear is infected|`|zgBelCROaa	Ew. Use a flame to sterilize a needle then poke it through. It will bleed and hurt a lot.

A sewing needle isn't the same thing and cannot be properly sterilized (fire & alcohol does not make something sterile).  <br>  <br>  An earring is blunt.

Ouagu7e0aa	There are these really good oil blotting pads that you can buy at CVS/Walgreens..any place like that.  <br>  <br>  I really like the Neutrogena ones. They're about $7 for a pack of 60.  All you do is rub it all over your face and it sucks up all your oil.  <br>  <br>  They're really great!!|`|DWnBKMncaa	i sort of had the same problem. i used roaccutane for a bit and it cleared my skin up but then i started getting some breakouts and used proactiv, but just the facewash. it works really well<br>  <br>  try just using the face wash. its a good routine to have, washing your face, but if you still have problems, ween yourself off the other stuff. also, try using other face washing products to see whats best for you. i recommend nivea face washes, not neutrogena as it can often be too harsh|`|KbxWS8GOaa	I f you want to use other brand other than proactiv. read the direction if it is for oily, dry or normal skin. The more you stop, the more oil or pimples will appear again( maybe due your eating habits or hormone is changing). I m using acne free ( if you want to try that).|`|tWePoJYNaa	that happens to a lot of people with proaciv apparently. For short term help wash your face with an oil free face wash for acne. I use Neutrogena (it's orange in a square pump bottle. Every drug store has it). Then have something to put on your skin twice a day after you wash it. I have a doctor prescribed creme, but you can find some great stuff at the store. Any product with benzol peroxide will be great for you. Or even just straight benzol peroxide. It comes in a 5% and 10% formula. <br>  <br>  To help your acne in the long run, watch what you put in your body. Acne isn't just an external reaction to your life (and genetics unfortunately). It also needs to be treated internally to be even more affective. I started drinking more water daily, and after a month I noticed a huge difference in my skin. It was less oily and I had only one active pimple. I also take Chinese herbs I got from my acupuncturist which work wonderfully and have helped immensely as well,  but those may be harder to come by. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

9h5phsluaa	Ok, so i've done the national american miss pageant for 4 years before i finally won in 2006. The pageant isnt "rigged" but there are some things that the pageant staff does not tell you.<br>  <br>  In order to win, you generally have to do at least 3 of the optional contests, and at least one of these must be spokesmodel or talent. The reason is that if you're going to be "queen" you need to be, well, talented. Sorry if this seems arrogant but, it IS a pageant.<br>  <br>  So, if you are great at  public speaking or communication, do spokesmodel. If you can sing or dance, do the talent. If you have got both, all the power to you.<br>  <br>  For optional contests I suggest a combination of the  Runway Competition, talent and/or spokesmodel, and photogenic. It shows that you are well-rounded.  Of course, how you execute the required competitions is important too!<br>  <br>  You know how for personal introduction they tell you to only say "name, hometown, & ambition"? Well, sorry sister, but that's the MINIMUM.  You have to add flavor and personality to it.For example, when i was Miss Maine i said   <br>  <br>  "Bonsoir ladies & gentlemen.  This 16 year-old from the state where 'America's day Begins'  is raising the curtain on her theatrical career in acting, song, and dance. I enjoy volunteering in my community with such organizations as the American Red Cross. In the future I also see myself attending college, and pursuing a career in Clinical Psychology.  From beautiful Arundel, Maine, I AM Hillary Riemenschneider."<br>  <br>  It sounds cheesy, but if you go back & watch your pageant video, you'll see that the winner had a unique introduction that made it memorable.<br>  <br>  I could give ALOT of advice for NAM, but only if you want it. Message me if you'd like :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~hills|`|Rcs1X5Zeaa	Sure why not? :)|`|J8xRVPulaa	Everything is corrupt nowadays.

4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	There are ones who just take on those styles as a trend and they're likely to stop dressing that way after high school or at least after college, but then there's those who it's not simply a fad/trying to be different but rather a genuine interest in the culture.  I guess the current emo and scene thing is a little different because it's more recent so I don't know how kids are going to go with that, but I'm goth and out of high school.  I never dress that extreme anyway, unless I'm going to a goth night or something (and I don't really mean extreme in the outrageous sense because that would be tacky to me, but I mean wearing things I wouldn't wear on a day to day basis like corsets and fishnets).  But anyway, I'm in college, still goth and I'm going to graduate in a year and a half and may go to grad school first, or may enter the workforce (probably book publishing), but I don't intend on dropping my goth style.  I might have to get dressy clothes for an office, but I have clothes currently that are both professional, but worn in the right combination that will look goth and still be acceptable in an office setting.

What's great about her is that she gets her clothes from small-name designers and looks just as good as anyone else. Also, she's very bright and seems to also be very kind and good-natured. Michelle Obama is an example for young girls, similar to Jackie O., because she knows some things her husband doesn't know (which is precious in an atmosphere of sexism and inequality) and is still graceful and feminine at the same time.<br>  <br>  That's why people love her, and that's why Vogue finds her interesting. It's not all about age or weight or race or what you'd usually find on the cover of Vogue - sometimes, Vogue includes actual content, and this is one of those times.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I see no reason why she shouldn't be.|`|hzQDocWaaa	well how did other girls get on the cover of vogue like lizzy mcguire their aren;t the prettiest girls either

ZfSELfCvaa	Most likely your girlfriend is correct and its inflamation from the razor. <br>  <br>  It could also be that she wears a helmet of some sort that clings to this area... the sweat build up could clog pores and result in acne. <br>  <br>  You could ask her but you probably shouldn't haha ; )|`|8PwPmQUpaa	maybe idk im answwering for the pints|`|tlsgvCwHaa	Who cares, its not on you, so let her worry about it.<br>  <br>  But sounds like she does shave and has razor burn.<br>  Or maybe she sweats because of her hair around that area and has irritation.<br>  <br>  Or maybe she's just prone to acne around that area.<br>  <br>  Again, I wouldn't worry.|`|hh9hoMA2aa	If you really are concerned about her, you at least can try to talk to her in private--so as not to embarrass her-- and not ask other people's opinion how did this thing happened.

BWfg2oLvaa	Yes, it's an excellent makeup. They have one of the widest ranges of colors available on the market, and do not contain bismuth oxychloride, which is an additive that Bare minerals uses that makes you look strangely shiny and can cause itchy skin that breaks out. I myself have been using Everyday Minerals and could not be happier with it.  It is also significantly cheaper than bare minerals, though is only available over the web ( they have inexpensive sample sizes you can buy to try).

AA11575632	I am 5'8 and 130 and people think I am skinny-healthy. My mom thinks I need to eat more but I wear a size 2 long in Abercrombie and even smaller sizes in Aero, Lucky, and 7 for all Mankind. I wear size xs,s and medium in tops depending on the type of top and sometimes I like my tops to hang loose. I feel fat some days and will wear flowy tops and other times I wear fitted tees. It's not what size clothing you wear or how you look, but how you carry yourself and how you feel about yourself. I agree with someone above me who said you probably have distorted body image. I used to wear 6 in Abercrombie in High School and now I wear 2 or 0... pretty ridiculous. You gain and loose weight quite easily during teenage years. I seriously don't think there is any way you can look "chubby" with 5'6 as your height and 125 Ibs as your weight as I am quite close to that myself and none of my friends would call me "chubby". Healthy, perhaps, but not chubby. <br>  This may sound stupid, but the type of mirror you use can drastically effect how you percieve yourself. I used to think I was fat when I used a wide mirror but ever since I started using door mirrors (the long ones), I think I look pretty thin. Not skinny, but healthy thin (isn't that an oxymoron?). Lol. Maybe its the mirror. Don't worry about your body. I am sure you look just fine. Look on the bright side, you are not overweight and you are not skinny. You've got it good. People can't say your are anorexic or fat. You look healthy but you know you are thin... sounds pretty satisfying to me.|`|7BjSrIsGaa	You are not chubby! That is perfectly normal weight! And if your friends judge you by your weight, then they are not good people. Pants sizes vary, and you could be skinny, but have size 5 or 6 size,it all depends the size of your hips and waist. If I were you, I would not be worried about that. Unless you are in the overweight range (which your not I checked), then weight is just a pointless number. Good luck =)|`|EWETAH0daa	it is possible to be skinny for your height. i have large bones and i looked sick like i puke at a size eight. are you wearing the same brands as your friends? some brands are bigger others are smaller. in the last 10 years sizes have changed. 5 is now a 1 and so on. and you may have larger bones. or yes some body fat but a a size 1 2 i wouldnt worry about it.|`|xTaE8GLUaa	everyone carries weight differently.  You're probably not as "chubby" as you think you are.  You might have a distorted body image.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	your so weird. just go with it.|`|rJG4Hc1Daa	It depends on where you're buying your jeans. Different stores size them differently. For example, I'm a four at most stores, like Gap, J. Crew, or Banana Republic, but when I go to the "young" stores, like Hollister or Ambercrombie, I'm a nine. Also, I'm sure that you judge your own body much more critically than you judge your friends' bodies. And if you fit into a size one, then there's no way you could be considered "chubby"!|`|nbE87b9paa	Clothing brands made sizes differently.<br>  Your def not chubby either.|`|nbWO3IANaa	Maybe you are untoned/flabby?<br>  1] Do some aerobic exercise for 45 min three days a week, <br>  2] light weights three days a week, alternating with <br>  3]  3 sets each of 10 reps of pushups, pullups, situps, obliques, and crunches three days a week
GgHYpASIaa	When you get out of the shower put some "garnier fructis sleek & shine" serum in your hair. <----$3 in Wal*Mart.<br>  Then some "frizz ease".<----$5 salon.<br>  Then some "Got2b hair thickener". <----$1 at the dollar store.<br>  Blow dry, and curl.<br>  Also what I noticed helps, is if you put a bit like an a fourth of a squirt of serum on each piece of hair your going to curl.<br>  You'll have the most gorgeous curls, I promise you.<br>  Also make sure your curling iron is gold plated, or whatever you wanna call it.<br>  Make sure you have some sort of heat protection.
Z0OCvVQbaa	It works pretty good and smells incredible.I prefer Garnier Fructis though.
cNZAO5BRaa	Powder will make it ten times more visible. You definitely need to start using a cream or liquid sort of makeup: NOT powder or even cream-to-powder.<br>  <br>  Lipgloss won't highlight it at all though; actually, as long as the rest of your face is matte, it will make the peach fuzz much less noticeable because the focus will be on your luscious, glossy lips!|`|yMzDqdzbaa	wax it off,<br>  it fixes it.<br>  <br>  both powder and lipgloss will make it more prominent-looking.<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry:(<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:<br>  if you dont want to remove it,<br>  youre screwed!<br>  you dont have a choice. <br>  theres no other way..|`|reh7xuNlaa	Ok.. Never put the powder on.. It will make it stand out more. The powder latches to it. Making it rise. The liq foundation helps it lie down. Put liq foundation on and leave it. That's going to be your best bet with out having to remove it.  Lip gloss don't really make it stand out.  Hope I helped. :)|`|J6X0JZkKaa	dont try powder it'll make it stand out if you dont want to try wax try a hair removal cream it's not painful and takes it right off just make sure it's for facial use.|`|gIChvgVWaa	DON'T WAX if you can help it. powder does make it a little better, and if the lip gloss accidentally gets on your "fuzz" it can make it stand out more|`|6FbB3q7Raa	How do you feel about bleaching?

You say **** YOU because I am a woman and I don't matter what I look like it matters what is INSIDE your looks shouldn't have to make you happy. You just need a girls night out with your closest friends remember, a girls best accessory is her friends :* Self-esteem really has nothing to do with anything other than your own judgment of worthy you are, so stop thinking about yourself! When you stand in front of the mirror don't think about your flaws, think about the good things like your killer eyes or beautiful hair. Smile. Smile a lot. Even if you do have braces, when you're older and have the most amazing smile it will all be worth it (trust me I've had braces for a while too...) Believe you are beautiful. Think beautiful and live beautiful. Walk on the street and feel beautiful. Hold your head up high, toss your hair, and take a deep breath. If you don't believe you are beautiful, how will others see you as beautiful?

(:|`|JlG0Rv3Haa	omg I can't believe everyone is saying short hair!!! :-0 <br>  <br>  Listen to the husband, if he says you look sexier with long hair believe him. Men are attracted to long hair because long hair says to them young, fertile, sexy... I cut my hair short a year after I was married and all my friends told me married women cut their hair short because sometimes it's easier to style, takes less time. And I regretted it the moment I got home!<br>  <br>  As a woman I tell you long hair looks sexier, way way way more. If you're wanting a sexy look, you can go for layers, bangs, texture on long hair, but whatever you do don't cut it short, I know you'll regret it. And besides, don't we want to please our husbands? My husband has also told me long hair on women is so much sexier. :-) Good luck deciding, I hope I've persuaded you to stay with long hair!

Play off of that. usually works if you really want to manipulate your own mother.|`|B8oct3Yfaa	If your just dying it darker it has less chance of damage so I say go for it.|`|9924978a027d4db9bf72b068fc058d30aa	Well, it depends on your skin tone.

N5qx5NUvaa	I just bought the hello kitty lip conditioner from MAC in pink fish. I didn't think of it too much before I bought it, but now I love it. I just got a second one as a back-up because i'm obsessed with it. It is tinted, so it gives a subtle pink to your lips. It isn't sticky and thick like VS. It is expensive, but I think its totally 100% worth it. Also, MAC is really good about returns/exchanges, so if you don't like it, you can return it without any problems! :)|`|XrMMH5tZaa	i have the vics one and love it<br>  its cheaper too|`|ZjG8780saa	i havent tried VS soothing lip balm but i do have macs lip conditioner and i love it. it is totally worth the 15 bucks. its smooth and moisturizing. there is also tinted lip conditioner from mac if you want a hint of color. the new hello kitty line by mac has two tinted lip conditioners in the collection. a coral-y color called popster and a soft pink in pink fish. both are so cute!!|`|cef204e55ef21b92f83ccc265fe6d6d4aa	MAC's is probably better, but really you should just buy Victoria's Secret (assuming it's cheaper). Clear lip balm is not something you need to splurge on when it comes to makeup|`|a4rhTUeyaa	victoria secret... smells super good and is really glossy<br>  but one downside is that it is sticky. <br>  if you have your hair down your hair may get stuck to your lips.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	Mac's! It smells and even TASTES like frosting and you can just put it over your lipstick to lock in moisture and have a great smell/taste!
wEKhOOOSaa	MAC and Sephora|`|VN2wyTnFaa	If I had to pick one I'd say go to Sephora because they have a variety of brands so it's more likely that you'll find something that works perfectly for you. Sephora has a lot of really good brushes for good prices. For an eyeliner you should try either Urban Decay's 24/ Glide-on Pencil or Make Up Forever Aqua Eyes, they're about $16-$17. As for blush I like a lot of different kinds, but NARS is a good one, Stila's Convertible Colors are a nice cream blush, Tarte has good cream/gel blushes too that look really natural, and Benefit has some nice powder blushes. You should also check out Sephora brand blushes because they're about $10 or so. Good luck!|`|gXrwqoTGaa	Sephora and MAC without a doubt. Both have great return policies where you can return opened makeup and still get a full refund.|`|DixbTv9oaa	Sephora or MAC|`|rAAYZU7Raa	sephora|`|CkABSeYmaa	sephora and mac both have great selections

ojwRgCLqaa	Use Shampoo and Conditioner for dry hair. You can also get special serum for shiny hair. Your hair also gets shinier if you straighten it.<br>  <br>  Tip: If you have dry, dull, or really frizzy hair like me you should leave conditioner in for at least 3 min.

Gew6pZhbaa	Skip foundation, liner, and lipstick. You want to work with the basics since this is your first time wearing makeup. If you have problem spots on your face, like acne marks or dark spots, use a stick concealer, like New York Color Cover Stick ($1.72) in a shade lighter than your skin tone. If you get a little shiney or oily during the day, try New York Colors pressed powder in transluctant ($1.72). Next you want to try mascara. Jane Hi-Fiber and Jane Fan Club are both big favorites of mine. I believe they run less than $4.00, and are perfect for beginners (I still love using them, and I''ve been wearing makeup for years). If you can't find Jane, try Cover Girl Professional Mascara ($3.99). Pick a brown or black/brown shade of mascara to keep the look soft. Next, you can give shadow a whirl. Rimmel makes really cute eyeshadow sets for less than $4.00. Stick to light colors, like pink or pale browns and tans. After you get everything picked out, applying it is pretty easy. When using concealer, just dab it on and blend as much as you can to keep it from looking cakey or off-colored. Lightly pat pressed powder where you need it, like your nose, forehead, and over concealer. Next is mascara. Start at the bottom of your lashes and just swipe up a couple times until you get the right look. Don't do too much though, one full coat should be good for now. Next is eyeshadow. Usually sets come with a dark, medium, and light shade. The light shade is applied along your brow, the medium you put all over your lid, and the dark you apply on your crease. If you think it's too much, skip using the dark shade until you feel comfortable. Hope I could be some help, good luck!!|`|3PYBSFSyaa	I'm in the same situation you are.

Apply a small amount of shimmer right by the tear duct. For eyeshadow, use a one shade darker than your skin. Then, mascara. If you have blonde, red, or light hair, you should apply dark brown mascara, which will give you a softer look. For a really easy natural look just put on some clear mascara. <br>  Apply a clear or slightly tinted lip gloss to finish the look. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Method Two<br>  Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone (light, medium, or dark) and style (matt, natural, or dewy). <br>  Apply foundation by first putting on moisturizer to clean skin. Dab foundation onto cheeks, nose, and forehead. Blend it with your fingers and use downward strokes to flatten baby hairs. <br>  Apply concealer under your eyelids and smooth with fingers. <br>  Apply blush using a color that matches your natural glow. Apply with fingers or a sponge to the apples of your cheeks. <br>  Apply powder that matches your foundation color. Use a brush and tap of the excess powder. After waiting several minutes for your makeup to settle, start at the center and blend downwards. <br>  Schedule a free makeover at a beauty counter in a department store. Ask them for a natural look, listen carefully, and consider using similar techniques if you like the results. Sometimes a professional knows best. <br>  If you have oily skin, use a powder or else your pores will show through. <br>  When choosing a foundation, make sure it is your skin tone. If not, you will always look unnatural. <br>  Choose makeup that is matte, with no glitter. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi

oA066Stbaa	u can't go wrong with golds and browns. they look great on everything especially a color like red. or u could try a light shade of red mixing with a light brown, orange, pink or a golden yello will look nice. anthing but blue it will clash with the dress and look too rainbowish and dumb, like u don't know how to put on make up. just so you know golds, browns, and greens with make brown eyes pop like crazy they look beautiful on brown eyes. and add some balck eyeiner and mascara too. somkey eyes will look good too. but in my opinion try this.<a href="http://img241.imageshack.us/img241/2370/smokey2zs5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img241.imageshack.us/img241/2370/...</a><br>  it'll look amazing.<br>  or these.<br>  <a href="http://www.allure.com/images/trends/2008/01/trsl01_versace.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.allure.com/images/trends/2008...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/users/2/20652/26_2007/CashmereCocoa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.teamsugar.com/files/users/...</a>|`|zFwjZy53aa	I agree a smokey look goes well with almost everything and looks nice no matter what look you go for, dramatic or flirty.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I would recommend using gray shades and go with a smokey eye look. It's the safest way to go.|`|3EBGykXEaa	you could go for the somkey eye with a greyish/black color eyeshadow. it would look nice!|`|RZmGSlhYaa	I would go with a neutral taupe color.  A variety of browns would go well with the dress.  You could do a tan color over the entire eyelid and put a darker shade of brown inside the eye creases and in the corners of the eyelids to add a more dramatic effect since it's a formal occasion.  Make sure to put a lighter shade like tan on the brow bone to accentuate her brows and use a nice brush to blend all of shades together.|`|MAtnvBT6aa	mabee metalic grayish like mac smut is rlly pretty an says it has red shimmer so it wood look good wit the dress|`|a4rhTUeyaa	light brown eye shadow|`|SmJ8jXwRaa	Browns would be good|`|nbWO3IANaa	Suggest browns/golds, to enhance brown eyes and NOT clash with dress.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Try blue. Blue is a very common eyeshadow color. Blues are all about being noticed, not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop. <br>  Consider silver/gray. Silver/gray brings on heavy metals and drama. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with blue or brown eyes. <br>  Put on brown. Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown eyes and hazel or light brown eyes depending on the shade of brown. <br>  Be careful with green. Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of springs best colors, it looks wonderful with Light brown or blue eyes. It can also be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the wicked witch of the East! Be careful and sparing in adding it. <br>  Add some purple. This was the spring of 07's signature color but it looks great in any season when done well. It looks awesome with brown or green eyes. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi

I pretty much wear T's all year round, but I layer more in winter, a little less in early spring and not at all in late spring and summer. I usually don't wear flip flops or shorts until summer, but some sandals, all flats, bermudas, skirts, capri's and some jeans are still in my wardrobe. Depending on the day, I might wear a rain coat/ pea coat, a hoodie, or just a cardigan. Basically, it all depends on what the weather for the day is, because in spring, it can go from rainy to sunny and cool to warm in a day. Ha ha. Hope this helps.

Your hair looks great pulled off your face. Bangs will accent your eyes.<br>  Most Complimentary Style: You look best when styling hair off you face. Hair pulled back<br>  Avoid: Wearing to much hair in your face. You want to show off those perfectly proportioned features! <br>  Keep in mind, if you want to play up certain areas of your face here's how:<br>  Bangs- Will accents eyes.

Buy her a different piece of jewelry if you want and make your intentions known, but I don't think most women need that.|`|ksZfTHyQaa	I think so. The celtic ring that might be perfect for this is the Claddagh. Here's a description of it: <br>  <br>  The Claddagh's distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart, and usually surmounted by a crown. The elements of this symbol are often said to correspond to the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). The expression which was associated with these symbols in the giving of the ring was: "With my hands I give you my heart, and crown it with my love."

vg9C2TqQaa	shop at popular stores. delia's, abercrombie, hollister, pacsun, gilly hicks, forever 21, barneys new york, the loft, ralph lauren, and especially juicy couture. depending on your style, is which store you go to. floral prints, dresses, converse sneakers, gladiator sandals, cardigans, scarves, and bright colors are very popular this season. thick bracelets and chunky necklaces are also very stylish. dress age appropriate too. and have fun with your clothes!! express yourself through your outfits. thats important, too. for pocketbooks, use slouchy tote bags or large metallic studded bags. if you're buying clothes at the same store as they sell toaster ovens, like kohl's or target or walmart, then chances are you aren't very stylish. (no offense to anyone). if money is an issue, forever21 is your best bet. theyre affordable and way in fashion. it is however hard to find something nice there sometimes. urban outfitters is also another bold, fashion forward, euro/new york style store that is pretty awesome. i really hope this helps!!|`|JFA9DpFCaa	please dont dont dont shop at hollister/abercrombie/etc.  It is sooo tacky not trendy.

OHs8yJiOaa	The half jackets came out in 2002, the flak jackets in 2007.<br>  <br>  The half jacket models are a good deal smaller than the flak jacket, and tend to "fit on the face," generally towards the front of the face. The flak jackets are larger in general, and can extend out towards the edges of the face. The stems are thicker, and the lenses provide more coverage. Some people think the half jackets were too small, and some others think the flak jackets are a little too large. I personally far prefer the flak jackets (in the XLJ model). They're essentially what Oakley came up with as an alternative after a few years of feedback on the half jackets.<br>  <br>  Also, all flak jacket lenses use Oakley's permanent hydrophobic coating, which makes them a lot more smudge, fog, dust, and water (and even scratch) resistant than the half jacket lenses. Though the half jackets were (and still are) pretty popular, they were known for issues with sometimes fogging, and especially with smudging as people would get sweat on them, try to wipe them, etc. With the flak jackets, things stay pretty clear and they wipe clean quite painlessly.<br>  <br>  Since the half jackets have been around longer, they've had more lens options available for a good while, though Oakley seems to be rapidly filling out the flak jacket options as they prove fairly popular. The flak jackets were all over the 2008 Olympics, but I'm not sure I recall seeing any half jackets this round -- many athletes have switched over for the hydrophobic lenses if nothing else (though other models like the Radars have them too).<br>  <br>  You might want to stop by an Oakley dealer to actually try things on. Though it might help to see photos on someone's face (see below), I think the difference is a lot more apparent in person, and especially during actual use.<br>  <br>  It might help to also read reviews of the models at the following:<br>  <a href="http://o-review.com/glasses.asp#Jackets" rel="nofollow">http://o-review.com/glasses.asp#Jackets</a>|`|0cagihhwaa	logo is different. take a look eshopintuition.com or ebay.com, there are many designer sunglasses,  u can compare it with each other,

If you have to ask strangers what the better tattoo is to get, I would say you need to think long and hard about whether to get the tattoo at all. It has to mean something to you.

Pick one from each hat and give that person the truth/dare written on the paper.  <br>    It's hard to play board games when you've got a lot of people so movies and truth or dare probably work the best.  Maybe you can give eachother mani/pedis!  <br>  Hope I helped  =)<br>  Good luck, and have fun!!!

(easily found online) and wear shoes like Nike and Emerica. <br>  good luck (:<br>  <br>  you can email me for more info.|`|0TTQ0AI6aa	those are all very good brands! <br>  :)... try some hollister,american eagle, abercrombie and fitch|`|vQWZx5Yuaa	awww cute lol...<br>  yea like abercrombie or hollister<br>  pac sun is awesome to =]|`|kpTlEW59aa	try pac sun (pacific sun wear)|`|FzL2bRuFaa	American style ranges but most are on the preppy side. I don't think you're too fancy stores like the ones you listed show you have class. I see a lot of guys wear dc (hats,shoes,hoodies)and graphic tees.

But i guess if you live in NYC designer stores are all they got. Nike, Hugo Boss, surfer brands like Volcome, billabong, hurley, and O'Neil, Vans, and Element are what every american boy pretty much wears because there stuff is cute on guys and its not all that expensive. <br>  <br>  <br>  I dont think you need too impove anything by the way<br>  I give you a ten :))
dBqV5ZjQaa	That has happened to mine to! I thought it was from my washing machine but since it was yours to I guess it is just the quality of them.|`|jamvptm0aa	idk not me maybe its too old..or you forlded it so it poped out..

TprIqGhCaa	Dove Clinical Strength|`|tlsgvCwHaa	I use Teen Spirit. It smells great and lasts really long, especially the smell. It comes in three colors I believer, blue for berry, pink for flower blossoms and red for strawberries. I love it, it barely gets on my shirt or stains.  Its worth it though, because it smells great. Its cheap too, like less than $2.00 It's a teen deodorant but I like it and have been using it for over 3 yrs now. XD|`|dBPCT41kaa	I think secret platinum is the best.|`|wEKhOOOSaa	I like Avon|`|bAicPpJaaa	i like secret platinum invisible solid. it works really well, but it does leave marks on your shirts if you wear super short sleeves. when i wear clothes like that i use secret clinical strength.  it works really well and it doesn't rub off onto your clothes.  the reason i use 2 different kinds is because secret platinum is bigger and a lot cheaper than the clinical strength stuff (about $4 vs. $10) so i only use the clinical strength when i need too. hope this helps!|`|Qp6gqIW2aa	SECRET|`|NiPuaY0Saa	secret|`|BHDXE76oaa	i use dove|`|l2E4qEsAaa	I have tried them all and have found the longest lasting one to be Degree Invisible Solid.

I think it really depends on the persons all-around looks/face. I think people with sharper, thinner faces look best with dreads. :D|`|qkLqlW4Caa	heyy okay so i personally don't like dreads cause i don't like really long hair on guys and most people do think that they are dirty and those people will instantly turn you off. even if you do keep it really really clean it is a turn off for some.

idhcqr5Daa	'Stop popping!' It's tempting, but honestly, it make things worse. If you absolutely must pop, make sure that the area (and your fingers) are clean and disinfected. Best method of dealing with acne scars and cuts is just to let your body do the works. Keep the irritated area clean and use as little make-up on the area as possible. <br>  Use a Scar Treatment. For post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation (brown or red marks on the skin) try something like "Zenmed's Scar Treatment Kit", Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Acne Mark Fading Peel. Mederma is also a good "spot" treatment. For "ice picks" or "crater-like" scars, which are actual dents in the skin, often the most effective treatment is seeing a doctor. <br>  Moisturize and protect. Always use an oil-free moisturizer that has SPF. Try Body Guard Exquisitely Light SPF 30 For Face & Body. <br>  Triple Antibiotic ointment If you put this on overnight, it will fade your scars and get rid of them. Don't put too much on in one spot, it can cause your skin to get overly oily <br>  Avoid touching your face. Your hands can transfer additional oil to an infected area. <br>  Scars tend to be more noticeable on pale skin. You can combat this with a safe self-tanner (not to be confused with tanning booths and/or sun-tanning, which are unhealthy for your skin). You could also buy a natural redness - countering concealer. <br>  Neosporin is ideal for speeding up healing time thus causing lesser scarring. There is also Neosporin Scar Solution. <br>  You can use plain yogurt to help fade scars. Apply it to your face twice daily. It will moisturize your face, purify it and your skin will heal much faster. <br>  Apply aloe vera or vitamin E; it will speed up the healing process. <br>  Cocoa butter is a rich moisturizer that is very effective. Try Palmer's Scar Serum. It contains Cocoa butter, Vitamin E, Shark Liver Oil, Silicone, and Allium CEPA and is around $15 available from most chemists. <br>  Use lemon on scars daily, but use moisturizer before going to bed as the lemon may cause dry skin. <br>  Honey Mixed with lemon & almond oil and milk = acne free <br>  Moisture helps scars heal, so be sure to moisturize (But be careful of heavy moisturizers that can clog pores). <br>  Do TCA peels of 12% three weeks apart. Amazing, effective, and inexpensive. <br>  Aloe-vera often helps. If you rub the gooey inside of an aloe-vera plant on the affected area, you will see results in a matter of days. Do it once or twice a day, and simply leave it on. Aloe-vera also helps to eradicate acne scars. <br>  For mild scars and cuts, using Neoporin works well. Put a little on each morning and night after cleansing your face. <br>  Picking at the scabs and scars will only make things worse. <br>  If your acne ruptures even when you don't touch it, you need to see a dermatologist. Bleeding or excessive acne is not natural, and may be the result of an infection or allergies. Get treatment as soon as possible. <br>  Acne is caused by a bacterial infections - more times than not.

lg2RfcrQaa	It's because you've used soap on it. Soap dries things up. It happened with me because I was using a special antiseptic spray, and it cleared up a little when I stuck to just using salt a few times a week (after a few weeks, you don't need to be doing it every single day).

AA10224643	When you are 18 you have the legal authority to do what you please with your body.  Having said that, if you are still living under their roof you must remember to be respectful.  If you feel you are adult enough to make those kind of decisions then you are adult enough to get a job and your own place of residence.  If you still need to rely on your parents to take care of you then be prepared to take the heat.  I am a parent of teenagers and have just recently let my daughter get her nose done.  I am, however, making them wait until they are adults and on their own for tattoos as sometimes young ones tend to make rash decisions and do not realize that they are forever. It's really up to you to decide what is more important to you.  A rocky life at home or maybe waiting awhile until you are on your own.  Good luck!|`|TilqqjNMaa	I seriously doubt you are going to change his mind!<br>  And if you try to do it when you are 18 he may just keep his word.<br>  If you are still living under his roof he will still tell you what you can or cannot do.<br>  And of course will tell you if you don't like it get out<br>  I am only saying this from experience.<br>  I wanted my tongue pierced when I was 18 but my dad hated all the crap.<br>  I waited till I moved out and then got all the tattoos and piercings I wanted<br>  =)|`|AhBJT5xFaa	Oh..

Hopefully you can find a way to make sure they aren't present for the surgery.(Don't tell them) Once it has already been done , tell them you didn't want them to worry. You found out that you were going to  have to have some breast surgery, and that it would require some reconstructive surgery that could be done at the same time. If there are any questions as to the size, you can tell them that since you had to have the surgery anyway, that you decided to have them reconstructed the way you've always wanted them. If they start talking cancer, just tell them , it was non malignant tumors in both breast that were causing you some pain and unsightly deformities that you felt you just couldn't live with, and that your Dr. said could get worse, and slim chance, but may become malignant  in the future. You just decided that you weren't going to take any chances, and got the problem fixed. Besides you couldn't imagine living with that discomfort any longer.  We won't tell them that the real discomfort was your own mental image of your breast.Now wasn't that easy. Just pray that nothing goes wrong during surgery, and for forgiveness for the tall but ingenious tale. Hope all goes well, or you'll have a lot of explaining to do. Hey, if you chose this option, you should change your screen name to sneaky.
RvddYKqjaa	Many black women have found that the men in their lives are extremely weak, and the women have to take over the household. Rather than have to go out to work to support a lazy husband, they would rather be single. Black women are a real force to be reckoned with as far as weak men go. I really admire them. <br>  The Million Man March was an opportunity for men to get together and just learn the responsibilities of being a man in this society. Most of the women don't think it helped. Actually I think black men are a lot less judgemental than many white men, and black women have a better self image too. They are not always dieting or trying to dress like everyone else. Many black women are quite beautiful. EDIT: I live near Baltimore. My information comes from having many single, black women as co-workers and friends. I can't speak for all black women, or any women in general. In our school system we have a majority of children with only one parent, and that's their mother.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	U know you are going to get razed on this Q, right? a lot of men do not find black women unattractive. <br>  <br>  If (any) woman is single it is because:<br>  <br>  She's focusing on herself<br>  She just broke up and needs a breather<br>  She refuses to settle|`|sg0m6LBRaa	uhm thats vry general.<br>   a ton of "white women" are single too...<br>  <br>  mine with pic?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvVBt24Q_x70EeUTk6mM26Tsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219173305AAnkSKX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|BBZbXfC4aa	because either they are ugly or really hot, and there are very few of those.|`|XZ0RvmTRaa	and that's not stereotypical at all -_-|`|R1scPRfVaa	...

i38Ev1Zaaa	what size curling iron are you using?<br>  <br>  for that look, your going to want a 1 1/2 inch curling iron.<br>  <br>  For that look, just spritz your hair with some heat protectant, and clip it into sections, curl 2 inch sections of hair at a time in a spiral motion, holding them on the iron until they're warm on the outer layer.<br>  <br>  Finish your whole head and STOP.<br>  <br>  The curls should look curlier than what you want them to be at the end. The them cool completely for about 10 minutes before you proceed styling.<br>  <br>  To get that loose curl style, just grab a little bit of styling creme, like the Garnier styling creme:<br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2144117&productId=prod2144117&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat120028" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a> <br>  <br>  rub the styling creme inbetween your palms, then run your fingers through your curls. This should loosen them up a bit.<br>  <br>  After you get the style you want, just finish it off with a nice hard hold hairspray.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|441GSyaMaa	Can't you use some straightners (mainly GHD's I think would work best), clamp the hair then role it up the hair so it's ont too much heat on the hair to make it mega curly <br>  <br>  :-S I think that may work, being a guy I can't really be sure... but hey, it's worth a go... as I'd like to know how that turns out lol|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	You are probably holding the curling tongs for too long each time. Try reducing the heat time to half what you did and see what the results are. If that proves unsuccessful then you could try standard curlers after washing your hair and let your hair dry naturally. Don't use heated rollers otherwise the curls will be too prominent which you don't want.|`|ONTzkwSqaa	You would either got to scrunch it a little <br>  <br>  Or you can get a flat iron that can make waves.|`|sUc1jUHhaa	well you could try washing your hair then when its wet put your hair in a middle parton and put your hair in 2 plaits , leave it maybe overnight so it will dry naturally.<br>  hope this helps x|`|kaHU3YiYaa	i think you should print out the picture and go to a salon and ask them. i bet they can help you :)

It was a radical solution to a frustrating problem.|`|SyyBtXFuaa	it possibly could be dandruff try headn shoulders or selsom blue 1st if they don't work try rid and a really fine lice comb but make sure its metal not plastic|`|tedJD26Uaa	Are you sure it might just be dandruff. But if you noticed bugs or eggs you may have lice so what you need is to take a shower with some lice shampoo found everywhere. Comb out as much eggs as you can and if that doesen't work put baby oil in your hair trust me it works! Its so slippery that the bugs slide out/drown and they die! if that doesent get ALLL of them out call a doctor to help you out and there is no side affects i had lice before and it worked make sure that you wash everything because lice like to hide in pillows and clothes so make sure you wash all of the clothes you used when u had lice. Hoped that helped! Good luck!!|`|XcBPoQSxaa	It sounds like dandruff to me...you may want to go and get it checked jsut to make sure because if it is lice, it needs to be treated because anyone with clean hair can get it from you if it is!

Maybe use Herbal Essences the blue bottle (Hello Hydration) or Head and shoulders.|`|dQcOpu2iaa	lice is black and they are really fast so if u touch them the will run. the white parts are eggs and they are only attached to the strands of ur hair and they are reallly sticky and hard to pull off. dandruff is white and flacky and can be on the scalp and or the hair strands (if you scratch ur head alot) dandruff is cause from either dry scalp or too much left in conditionor or even due to the whether or dry water. Look into dandruff shampoos i dont think u have lice.|`|AAlB49iraa	First off, you need to find out if you have lice. They are bugs that are tiny. you can hardly see them. if your "white particles" aren't crawling then you prob just need some type of medicated shampoo like head and shoulders. if you DO have lice you have to be very diligent in treating yourself and everyone in your household and washing EVERYTHING in either bleach water or very hot water. try  resources online for more info. And btw, if you only have dandruff and you treat it with RID or some other lice shampoo i cant even begin to tell you how irritated it will make your scalp.|`|p4RH3h1maa	Perhaps it may just me dandruff. Usually if it was lice I would recommend someone check to see if you do have them. (anyone with good eyes will do) And if you do have lice I went cvs and bought a kit of shampoo, lice comb, and bed spray (came all together in a box). If it's dandruff since dry skin can cause irratation use Head & shoulders.|`|owCzkhNRaa	you could try to wash Your hair everyday.<br>  and if that doesn't work then get dandruff shampoo.<br>  that should help but if it doesn't then maybe you need to shave Your head or something.if not then just keep washing Your hair every single day and use Your own brush and comb and shampoo don't wear antibody's hats or hoods.<br>  Just Be Cautious.<br>  So if you do have it you<br>   don't spread it.|`|H2yac1kUaa	see a doctor before you go all bazurk.<br>  it could also just be dandruff...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  please please pleasee answer my dating question. i'm in serious need of help:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjroFc4RO6xOrVY.WEbsXj7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219170637AAJG194">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  thx!!|`|2d551121552d809b5579c385a4e1891daa	You can go to any pharmacy and buy their recommendation.|`|h0XtWUW3aa	Just go to your local chemist and ask there and they will recomend the best shampoo.|`|3FYwht8Uaa	You most likely don't have lice, just dandruff.

When you have thick hair it is easy to get them and hard to get rid of them. I've never heard of anyone losing their hair but you can get an irritated scalp.<br>  <br>  Make sure to comb and comb your hair with a small-toothed comb. They make special combs for this. Maybe someone can help you with this.<br>  <br>  Also, you can talk to a county health nurse in your area.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!<br>  <br>  From the Mayo Clinic:<br>  <br>  Treatments and drugs<br>  <br>  Head lice<br>  Over-the-counter lotions or shampoos (Nix, Rid, others) are usually the first line of defense against head lice. However, if nonprescription products don't kill the lice, your doctor can prescribe a stronger shampoo or lotion.<br>  <br>      * Malathion (Ovide). This has been re-approved as a prescription drug for treating head lice. Malathion is flammable, so keep it away from heat sources such as hair dryers, electric curlers and cigarettes. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, talk to your doctor before using this product.<br>      * Lindane. Another type of prescription treatment for lice contains the medication lindane. Your doctor may not recommend lindane if you weigh less than 110 pounds, have used it in the past few months or if you're a women who is breast-feeding. Side effects may include skin irritation, seizures and, rarely, death. Using lindane in higher than recommended amounts, or for longer than recommended, increases the risk of side effects.<br>  <br>  Use these medications only as directed. Applying too much can cause red, irritated skin.<br>  <br>  Self-care important, too<br>  Whether you use over-the-counter or prescription shampoo to kill lice, much of the treatment involves self-care steps you can take at home. These include making sure all the nits are removed and that all clothing, bedding, personal items and furniture are decontaminated. In most cases, killing lice on your body isn't difficult. The challenge is getting rid of all the nits and avoiding contact with other lice at home or school.

ezoKuZLgaa	The phrase chiseled originates from Greek statues, where most of the men one, had a very defined jaw and bone structure, like high cheekbones, and a distinguished chin.<br>  <br>  Only time can give you one. While you may not get the "chiseled look you want" at the latest, by the age of twenty you should have a somewhat prominent facial structure. Give it time to let the baby fat wear off. If your over twenty and still have a round or "chubby" face try exorcising, and you'll find your cheeks becoming hollower.<br>  <br>  Look at your family. If many people have good defined bone structures on their face chances are you will too. They tend to come from more of the European heritages.|`|v5YBydCGaa	it means strong bone structure like a male model.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	chiseled jaw line means that you have a strong..well....jaw. <br>  <br>  It is usually masculine, and shows how defined your jaw and chin are.

You also would need some sort of professional or semi-professional makeup experience that may be hard to get at 18.  As for how much you get paid, I wouldn't know.  I am guessing that it differentiates from counter to counter, depending what brand you are selling, but you also would be working on commission, so, some of what you sell goes into your paycheck. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|2gstVBcMaa	I am pretty sure you need to be at least 18 with some sort of make-up background and experience (which might be hard for an 18 year old to get)|`|kQf5TbUFaa	idk on the hours but probally 14 although it may very cause you may need to be trained and other education needs

Fxb2eKcLaa	U will go through hell, but I can say that if you stick to what you just wrote you could lose about 1-2 pounds Daily.  As you said you got to keep your exercise up. When your body goes into starvation mode it will slow your metabolism to a crawl to save energy.  You could lose up to 20 pounds in the time that you said.  Also, no carbs, soda, sugar.  Just stick on protein. You may not LOSE weight but you will lose fat and gain muscle, which as you know makes your clothes fit better. Good Luck|`|nI9gXEHxaa	don't do it, its a bad idea

Concealers usually do a good job of hiding blemishes by blending the imprefection into the surrounding skin tone. This product is mainly used by women, but use among men is increasing.<br>  <br>  Both concealer and foundation are typically used to make skin appear more uniform in color. These two types of cosmetics differ in that concealers tend to be more heavily pigmented. Also, foundation is usually applied to larger areas than concealer is. The first commercially available concealer was Max Factor's erace, launched in 1938.<br>  <br>  Concealer is available in a variety of shades, from lightest to deepest. Some colors are intended to look like a natural skin tone, while others are meant to contrast with a particular type of blemish. White can be used to blur dark circles or bruising, and to brighten dull skin. Green and blue can counteract red patches on the skin, such as those caused by pimples, broken veins, or rosacea. A purple-tinted concealer can make shallow complexions look brighter. Colored concealers such as these are usually applied sparingly beneath a concealer or foundation that matches the wearer's skin tone. Skin-toned concealers are not only the most common type, but are often sufficient on their own at hiding/bluring imperfections.<br>  <br>  Concealers come in a multitude of formulations, from moisturizing to acne-fighting. Concealers are produced from lightest coverage all the way to the heaviest coverage. Let's use a scale system to show you the coverage level of a concealer (1-lightest to 7-heaviest). 1-loose powder concealer, 2-pressed powder concealer,3-matte mousse concealer, 4-pencil concealer, 5-liquid concelar, 6- Cream concealer, 7- Paste concealer. Depending on what type of imperfection you are trying to cover, will determine what form of concealer you will need. For example, hiding enlarged pores or mildly discolored spots may require a light concealer (1-3). For hiding something like acne, dark circles, or eye bags, 3-6 would be ideal. But for hiding/blurring medical scars or moles you will need the heaviest product (6+). Certain concealers may be used by itself, or in conjunction with foundation.|`|ewOD5x0taa	Well, I'm 13 and a guy. Concealer is makeup you put on before foundation, usually to cover dark areas like under the eyes.|`|3EBGykXEaa	Haha probably not, unless they have sisters|`|c008639131d10cb89d12c2d03e6f96f6aa	Prob not|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	if they're homo.|`|WHN5cuGZaa	i just found out a couple months ago.. <br>  i am 18 :D|`|91AMtKEraa	makeup that goes on your eyes to hide black bags right?|`|KjkOT5rfaa	i doubt it. unless he is gay or has 20 sisters :]|`|E8rFixesaa	Is it bad that I do?

Also, a really good idea for a punch is this:<br>  <br>  2 tubs of sherbet<br>  4 gallons of lemon lime soda<br>  <br>  Put em both in a large bowl and give it time.

65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	You should get a good razor such as Venus Divine, and you should shave before you get out of the shower like do it last because then your legs are really moist, and use a Body wash to shave, I like Dove Body wash, or Softsoap Spa the purple one, and dont rub your legs so hard with the towel just like gently touch the towel to them and then put on lotion right away, I have found Palmers Cocoa Butter works wonders on my legs, its real thick but it makes my legs soft and shiny and smooth.

L30nc3wsaa	Nars in the color named Orgasm or Deep Throat. Nars has the BEST blush in my opinion. You can find it at Sephora. However, they don't come cheap.|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Yeah go with Nars. And never go for cream blush... personally I don't think it ever looks natural because it's so heavy and you can't blend it as well. It's just a lot harder to work with.|`|hahwsMd7aa	mac and a rosy pink will do|`|ksZfTHyQaa	I think NARS makes the best blushes! But I also like MAC's. <br>  <br>  NARS: Orgasm is a great peachy pink with a bit of shimmer and if you want a pink one check out Angelika. <br>  <br>  MAC: The Hello Kitty blush in Tippy if you can still find it, Love Thing mineralized blush, Dollymix looks really bright on the pot but you can apply it with a light hand and build up the color. It's a really cute pink. <br>  <br>  Try the MAC 116 or 187 brush for application. I love and always use both. The 187 gives you a more subtle application.|`|KF4NmDqLaa	NARS makes an AMAZING blush called Orgasm. They sell it at Sephora. It's such a pretty shade and you would definitely love it. It's a little pricey... It around 25 I think.
6FbB3q7Raa	I generally choose blush color depending on what I'll be wearing.  For instance, if I'm going to be wearing warm colors, such as brown or orange, I go for a warm, peachy blush.  If I'm going to be wearing cool colors such as blue or silver, I'll go for a cool, pink-y blush.<br>  <br>  For smooth application, it's good to wear at least a light layer of powder on your face before applying blush.  A good, easy way to do this is to purchase a pressed powder that matches your skin tone and apply a light, even layer with a powder brush.<br>  <br>  My favorite smudge-proof eyeliner is MAC's Fluidline.  It takes a little practice to use, but it lasts and lasts.  I recommend using the NYX brand eyeliner brush to apply it.|`|SolKr1Amaa	1) To pick the shade of blush isnt that hard... its just a matter of what colour skin you have, and which colour you like best. Almay has a liquidy blush and its called Berry, i love that stuff, it works great!<br>  2)Foundation should go on before blush.. if you put the blush on then the foundation , the foundation will just cover up the blush . so dont do that. <br>  Eyeliner<br>  1)Almay and maybelline eyeliner work great, but eyeliner on the waterline isnt the greatest, because water washes off the liner. But try those 2 , they are the best kinds that i know of. <br>   :)|`|yMzDqdzbaa	i like maybelline new york eyeliner,<br>  <br>  and peach colored blush for me looks good(:|`|3EBGykXEaa	I like covergirl eyeliner. as for foundation you can wear powder foundation then put the blush on top. it really depends on your skin tone and type. if you want, you could go to a makeup counter at like macys and have a woman help you out with the right shades.|`|HoXhuqrEaa	I bought the best eyeliner ever! It is kind of expensive, but it stays on all day!<br>  I bought it at sephora and it is called makeup forever eyes. You have to buy a certian sharpener to use it so ask the ladies there for that too.

Gslf19Uvaa	That's pretty much exactly how my skin is. I have a brown sugar scrub from bath and body works, and I use that 2-3 times a week. Then every night I just wash my face with Neutrogena Rapid Clear Pads...they work wonders for me, and usually keep my face clear (you can get them at any drugstore or target, and maybe even king soopers). I also have a moisturizer from bath and body works, and it works well for me. A lot of people skip moisturizing because they think it will make them even oilier, but actually if you don't, than your skin produces more oil than it normally would.|`|4UXJoMbKaa	I've tried a lot of products for my extremely oily skin, and these are the only things that have worked for me.<br>  <br>  Apple Cider Vinegar: Dilute it 1:3 with water (1 part ACV, 3 parts water) and use on a cotton ball on your face. The normal pH level of your skin is slightly acidic (low pH), but the products we use, like soaps and cleansers, are basic (high pH). This can cause breakouts, and oily skin. Using it as a toner will dissolve oil, and balance the pH level of your skin so it won't produce so much oil.<br>  <br>  Light Moisturizer: Use a light moisturizer that won't clog your pores, or be too oily. Moisturizing is important, because if you don't, your skin needs to overcompensate and produce excess oil. I use Clean&Clear Dual Moisturizer. It contains a little Salicylic acid, so it controls oil throughout the day and fights pimples.<br>  <br>  A few extra tips: Lavender oil is really good for your skin (not to mention that it smells good and helps you sleep and keeps you focused and relaxed through the day). If you add one or two drops of it to your moisturizer, it will help keep oil at bay. It's not an oily oil-it won't make your skin shiny, and it's not heavy, because it's a dry oil. Get pure Lavender oil, nothing else added. It costs about $6-$8, but it lasts a long time and it totally worth it. I've seen good improvements in the oiliness and health of my skin. Also, make sure you're drinking a lot of water. More than you think you need to. This will help flush out your body, and moisturize your skin from the inside so it won't need to produce a lot of oil.<br>  <br>  :)|`|nAwqrAqDaa	What I do is use Tetracycline pills (2 250 mg pills a day), along with a commonly prescribed medical cream called Benzaclin. The pills help maintain the skin from clogging, the cream for drying the skin out and stopping surface oil.<br>  <br>  I have also used successfully the Clinique clarifying Lotion 2, which was originally created for removing makeup, but the alcohol in it is so powerful that it does a good job of drying and partially cleansing. I also washed my face when I did this with regular facial soap.<br>  <br>  A third thing, an exfoliate that I love, is the Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads, which are gentle and come in handy whenever I need them. They work for the entire day after using them once in the morning. Great for softening the skin and removing dead cells.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I completely understand what you are going through! I have dealt with acne for over 15 years. I have tried everything from the department stores as well. The only thing that works (consistently) for me is Proactiv. Everything else that I have purchased works for a couple weeks, then it's always back to oily skin and acne. You could try the Clinique 3 step acne system. It works okay, but like I said, it just wasn't consistent for me. If you are worried about buying online, I only buy my proactiv from QVC because they are reliable and they usually have a sale on it. I would look into the proactiv it will really help you, and you won't have to waste money on all the other stuff that just doesn't work. Good luck!|`|GrDQ2jb4aa	I had the same problem and went through a bunch of creams and facial washes and cleansing pads, the whole deal! The thing that has worked for me is Proactiv. I feel like I am on a commercial or something but I really love this product it works like within the first week you use it! AMAZING. My mall here in town actually has a vending machine that sells it, but you can also just order it online at www.proactiv.com  : )|`|idhcqr5Daa	Remove bacteria from your pores. Your skin can become "allergic" to this bacteria. Use anti-bacterial products containing benzoyl peroxide by rubbing, twice daily, into the pores over the affected region or washing with a medicated bar soap or wash. Keep in mind that this may cause dryness, local irritation and redness. Warm water cleans your pores very well. So you should fill the sink with warm water, pull your hair back and put your face under water for about 10 seconds. <br>  Avoid exposing your skin to other sources of oil and irritants.<br>  <br>  <br>  Break the habit of touching your face. <br>  Keep bangs off of your forehead. The oil in hair as well as hair products in general may clog pores. Or use oil absorbing sheets. <br>  If you use a phone a lot, don't let it touch your face. <br>  Change your pillowcases and sheets once a week to prevent the build-up of oils and bacteria that can re-occupy your pores. <br>  Use non-comedogenic moisturizers and makeup. Choose cosmetics that are water-based and hypoallergenic. Avoid oil-based products, coal tar derivatives, and heavy creams. Make sure you wash your skin thoroughly every night to remove makeup residue. <br>  Review your diet and the research surrounding the links between diet and acne. The relationship between food and acne is a debatable topic. Your diet may or may not have an effect on acne.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stay hydrated. <br>  Studies have shown a correlation between milk and acne. Try substituting with soy milk and other calcium-rich foods. <br>  Excessive consumption of foods high in iodine, such as seafood, may worsen acne, but probably won't trigger it. <br>  Research suggests--but does not prove--that a diet with a low glycemic index may reduce the likelihood of acne. High glycemic foods to replace with healthier alternatives include:<br>  <br>  <br>  soft drinks (drink water instead) <br>  sweets (substitute with fruit) <br>  white bread (replace with whole wheat bread) <br>  Consult a dermatologist regarding your acne. Minimize use of medication containing halogens (iodides, chlorides, bromides), lithium, barbiturates, or androgens. <br>  Keep your bedsheets clean. Wash your pillow case on a regular schedule to reduce the transfer of natural body oils. <br>  Wash your face one time a day. Don't overwash , because that will cause only more production of oil on your skin. Or use very gentle cleansers for normal skin that don't dehydrate the skin and wash twice a day. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|6ORP9P06aa	This stuffff is amazinggg <3<br>  Vitamin C Tea Tree Oil Peel Off Mask<br>  It minimizes your pores, and doesn't make your skin oily, & stops / gets rid of acne (:|`|tnQGOsaeaa	Use clean and clear Oil absorbing sheets, they take oil right off. <br>  For acne, wash your face everyday and moisturize with lotion<br>  <br>  ~bobo

Don't forget to vote for best answer!|`|6TTsFFVYaa	because woman have more pressure to look good and they just keep trying to make themselves look hotter and hotter all the time, it's never enough for society, and also with all the media and stuff...I could be wrong idk but thats my possible theory|`|qkLqlW4Caa	well i know this for a fact. men don't really care about their style. and they only have like 2 of them. but woman constantly care about what other people think of them and what they dress like. so if they see some one who is wearing an outfit and a guy is checking her out then they have to get it to seem like they fit in and have people notice them :)|`|xGHCDUT9aa	because we have more options...there's only so much you can do with a shirt and trousers! like men would never wear florals or certain patterns we do and women can also wear mens clothing and all they need to do is add a feminine piece to it|`|tiddZZuAaa	women tend to be more interested in fashion, so designers are constantly thinking of new designs because the clients want to stand out more or make a fashion statement, so fashions are constantly changing. well thats my theory anyway|`|1N73V2Ygaa	Because woman will actually buy the new trends where men won't. :-)|`|vsFp9faiaa	because we have more clothing options
KLG9FCWGaa	Go to a department store that has an underwear section and a bra fitter, like Sears or Dillards. They will measure you free and tell you your size. I was having the same problem. 34C was too small so I got fitted and she told me I wear a 32D. They are hard to find so I just buy 34D and they work great!|`|t4BpFdmdaa	look we cant find out ur SIZE out of no where, and i cant tell u to post ur pic cuz that would be gross. go to walmart or somewhere and ask them to get ur measurement. <br>  <br>  okay??<br>  =)|`|msNXomjTaa	Okay, I'm a guy, but lets just say I have a certain interest in this area! ;)<br>  <br>  Anyway, as I understand it, many, many women wear the wrong sized bra.  Few get themselves properly fitted, and few even know where to do the measurements.<br>  <br>  So: get yourself to a place where they know of such things, and get an experienced person to fit a bra properly.  They will know where and how to measure, and know what to look for in getting it right.  From what women who have done it tell me, it makes a really big difference in comfort and support.<br>  <br>  Now, I have some opinions as to what looks good, but that is 'way off topic here!|`|SYPcyNoTaa	look into the older women departments. they tend to have weird sizes  Your bra size changes as you get older and older people tend to have weird problems and get like 32D. try any department stores|`|aS81Ckdcaa	its possible to be between sizes

MFKgVsoAaa	well i'm not completely sure, but it seems to me that maybe the long dresses that women used to wear around the 1800's could be an inspiration to the fancy looks that are common now in balls and proms, etc. like these <a href="http://www.jadedcompass.com/ocular_helmsman/attire/evolofviccloths.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.jadedcompass.com/ocular_helms...</a><br>  <br>  also it seems to me that a lot of fashion for women is inspired by fashion that was once considered for men, like in this picture <a href="http://www.costumes.org/history/18thcent/general/mcclellan/fig340-344.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.costumes.org/history/18thcent...</a><br>  the tights, the buttoned or ruffled shirts, the suit jackets and fedora-style hats and those little booties like these <a href="http://ny-image3.etsy.com/il_430xN.25896631.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ny-image3.etsy.com/il_430xN.25896...</a> or <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=266280" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.o...</a> <a href="http://www.splendicity.com/shoeblitz/files/2007/11/corgie-ankle-boot.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.splendicity.com/shoeblitz/fil...</a><br>  <br>  also in the picture the women have these curly loose kind of updo hairstyles, which are common today for a more elegant look <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/taylor-swift-updo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/blog/wp...</a><br>  and also the corsets that they used to wear aren't really worn that commonly now, but we use different methods to get that little waist.<br>  idk, a lot of these are probably not directly inspired by the 1700-1900 fashion, but everything goes to the roots i guess. some people just carried that stuff on lol

Heres how to achieve the wavy look: <br>  <br>  Use a conditioner with detangling agent. <br>  Avoid washing your hair everyday. It is recommended to wash your on alternative days. <br>  Gels with Guar Gum as ingredient gives style to curly hair and avoids tangles. <br>  While using hair dryers leave them slightly damp and allow them to air dry. <br>  Keep long layers to avoid the curls to spring out especially when your hairs are over curly. <br>  Don't use hair products that have alcohol as their content. <br>  Try light highlighting with thin stands to add shine and depths to your curly locks. <br>  To separate the curs, wash hair, dry them using a towel, and use a spray or mousse with a non-aerosol hairspray. Now comb your hair and dry them with a diffuser. <br>  Keep you hair short, as it is easy to manage short curly hair than long ones.|`|dUaMqLZKaa	Get a loose perm.

A tattoo gun basically punctures the skin 1000 times a second. For some people the pain is more severe. It depends upon your personal tolerance. My first tattoo did not really hurt, but it tickled and the vibration from the gun got sort of annoying after awhile. <br>  <br>  16 is young to get a tattoo. You didn't ask for advice on this, but I would wait a few years if I were you. If you still want the same tattoo in the same spot then, go for it. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure the place you go has great credentials and is incredibly clean. They should use new ink, and new needles for each client. It might be a good idea to go to the place you are thinking of going to talk to the people that work there and watch them in action. most people don't mind letting other people watch while they get tattoos.|`|quHnUWyWaa	how do you perceive pain? i sleep when i get ink work done, and i don't like sessions to be less than three hours. <br>  but you can survive easier if you relax and practice deep breathing, to do this, breath in through your nose, taking the breath deep into your lower abdomen, slowly. on the exhale, breath out through your mouth, again slowly. if you focus on your breathing, you will not be as aware of what is happening on your arm, the human brain is not a multitasking machine, it can only focus on one thing at a time.|`|AzME6jxNaa	all tats hurt|`|A1xOf1O9aa	yea if your a wussy..<br>  <br>  grow some.

2zLOm497aa	Ok just the eyes right....Start by curling your eyelashes if you need to.  Apply dark brown eyeshadow from your lash line up to crease of your eye, and a little underlining your lower lashes.  Apply light color from crease up to eyebrow.  Then eye line your eye with black(top and bottom[pencil is best for this look]) Next eye line the inside of bottom lash line with a white pencil.  Finally apply two coats of black mascara on both your top and bottom lashes.

Q5hzle7Saa	It is not necessarily bad for your hair, but if you wash your hair everyday it can dry it out depending on the shampoo you use. It is just to just wash it every other day to let the natural oils moisturize you hair. It is still ok to get it wet though, just do not wash it everytime|`|o9lWV9gwaa	I personally don't think so, I take a shower every day and use shampoo, etc. I haven't noticed any detrimental effects.<br>  Although it is true that the body's natural oils will promote healthy hair. it is preferable to wash daily or at least every other day. This also depends on the amount of oil your skin produces during the day. If you find that your scalp is very dry, you may simply need to use an anti-dandruff/ moisturizing conditioner. On the other hand, if you find your hair is excessively greasy, you may need to wash it more thoroughly...<br>  <br>  Why do I know these things???|`|MuVPoAUiaa	I don't think so...I thought it was healthy to wash your hair daily!<br>  <br>  Probably as long as the chemicals in your shampoo aren't too strong...?|`|j34Eduvdaa	yeah its bad for your hair to wash it everyday because it will dry it out<br>  If your hair is oily then you will make the sebascious  ( or however you spell that word)glands move even faster when your scrub your scalp there for these sebascious glands will produce more oil faster

ZkporQ3gaa	First of all, maybe the shapoo you're using isnt really right for you. Try to find a shampoo to help oily hair. Wash your face at least 2-3 times a day. This prevents more oil from getting on the upper part of your body. If you have to use a conditioner, only condition the botom tips of your hair. Conditioners are usually what makes your hair more oily. Also Shower more often. The excess oil always goes away when you shower. So in other words, You should stay more clean!<br>  Hope this helps!!

It is a vitamin supplement recommended before and during pregnancy however there is no harm in taking them if you are not pregnant. Prenatal vitamins contain folic acid which is essential in promoting stronger and healthier hair (and nails).|`|3oanK9hkaa	I linked an article called "How to Stimulate Hair Growth". There is just way too much to type here! Hope it helps :)|`|AA11202462	try looking threw Chi products.<br>  i use that stuff all the time and get great results.<br>  they just came out with a hair growth product it works reallly well.<br>  and its only like 10-20 dollars.<br>  and honestly is works!|`|0tlkSKScaa	Mane and Tail shampoo and conditioner.<br>  It's for horses but it has human instructions on the back, you can get it from Walmart. It has tons of vitamins, I've used it for years.. it works I promise :]

There are a few different ways they can help.  You really should get it taken care of.  There could be a problem with infection of an open wound and you can't see that well back there.  good luck.

HpWCjBv6aa	It CAN ruin your hair, but conditioning will help out.<br>  <br>  If straightening every day is frustrating you, then change something up.  Make sure you use plenty of conditioner, as well as a heat-resistant spray to protect your hair from the damage of your flat iron.  Do not let your hair air dry, make sure you blowdry your hair before attempting to straighten it, it will make your life a lot easier.  As long as you're conditioning and blow-drying, your flat iron process shouldn't take more than ten minutes (I have the thickest of thick hair).<br>  <br>  Also, some people just have hair that is going to be curly or wavy no matter what they do.|`|Dyn8oLVxaa	it is so worth it. i hated straightening my hair every day and then go jogging or do sports and have it be ruined. now since i got it done my hair stays straight even when im drenched in sweat. yes it does damage your hair but thats where deep conditioners and hot oil treatments come in handy. i recommend pureology as they are the best even though they are expensive as hell.|`|bRbL4EGOaa	yes!<br>  It is very worth it.

WpgEqGrvaa	In my opinion the black vest with an orange tie would look better than the orange vest AND orange tie.<br>  All you need is a splash of orange to match, the tie would be perfect.|`|G0KEMulSaa	Black best orange tie personally I think colored vests look cheesy|`|ZyTZ9wDeaa	Go with the black best and tie, it will match with out looking like your trying too hard.|`|AnSFRCnraa	Go with the Black vest and orange tie its cheaper and it will look better.The orange on orange thing is just to orange.|`|oqcjAMJQaa	yeah, either would look fine. often guys just get a matching tie, as opposed to a matching vest. good luck!|`|AfKhj0Yuaa	black vest && orange tie

BcXMLGIKaa	no to the kool-aid.<br>  my moms a hairdresser and ive been getting my hair highlighted for two years now. i'm 13.<br>  it does ruin your hair; but extremely slowly.<br>  i hope this helps!! :)|`|OiLBE6hraa	unless your hair is very dark and you want it very  light blonde then no. and if you are getting the highlights touched up make sure they touch up the new natural color only (putting more bleach on the color that is already blonde may damage). highlights aren't exactly healthy for your hair but if you take good care of your hair and don't do it too often, your hair will remain in good shape|`|TprIqGhCaa	Kool-Aid makes you look dirty, don't.<br>  And as long as you don't dye your hair over and over again, it won't ruin it.

You could ask a Tattoo parlor. Or one of the web sites you hit on.
wT6ZcHRyaa	Your best bet would be to find a salon you've heard good things about and call them to ask. I'm not sure where you're from, but I'm from Long Island so things are typically more expensive here. Not only your location, but how good the salon is comes into account. Just check Yellow Pages. Their website most likely has some rating system on there.<br>  <br>  Also, you can usually tell the quality of the work the salon does by the price. Typically, the more expensive, the better they are. This isn't always true cause some crappy place could just rip you off, but usually that doesn't happen. So don't be so hooked on going somewhere that only charges $20, because chances are, your hair will just turn orange. Or it'll end badly in some other way, and with bleach, there are hundreds of ways it could go wrong.|`|LVO8ixtaaa	It depends on the salon, but it is usually around $100.|`|yMGIG5LBaa	Im from Long Island and its quite expensive !
qwhsRm3Vaa	you have to be 18 in order to get it done with your parents permission, but if you are younger than that, which you are, you must be 16 and have your parent sign a concent form saying that they agree to the terms. but then again in some places, there is no age limit.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	In Pennsylvania, you have to be 18 or older to get piercings and tattoos by yourself.

wHInFj4qaa	There is nothing wrong with your schools name on your butt. Order them in navy with THUNDER on your butt. Be proud and show off your bum in those sweats.|`|VXeJ550laa	You would have to have a fashionable swagger to pull it off.  Like, if you pull them up to your knees, cute thong sandals, and tight fitted shirt with a thick leather cuff.  That would look cool.

So think carefully before you do the color.|`|wJ45gsyZaa	It might make it harder, it depends where you apply. Most places are okay with it.

2qQPBDlkaa	hmm never listen to a girl or a gay guy about how long your hair should be.. after all it is NOT in their best interest if you attract the attention of guys...<br>  <br>  <br>  as far as how long it will take.. no one can answer tht everyone is different.. some it simply won't grow that long at all.|`|85KrSJh3aa	www.howtogrowhairfast.com is your solution|`|wT6ZcHRyaa	Hair grows 1/2in. a month. If you're straightening it or doing anything that makes the ends break off (ironing, coloring, wearing it in a ponytail too often, etc.), you should probably stop because then the ends will just break off and you won't notice your hair is growing. If your not doing anything damaging, I'd advise you get a trim every month or two just to get the dead ends off. Well, you should get a trim if you're damaging your hair too. But if you are damaging your hair, stop damaging it and get trims.<br>  Also, brushing your hair stimulates your hair follicles and helps your hair grow faster. Maybe not too much faster, but that's basically the only way to get your hair to grow faster. Don't think that a shampoo or some ridiculous concoction they sell in the stores will help, cause they won't.|`|4vXZbvgSaa	I agree with the first answer. Don't do it. You don't need hair down to your waist. I had my hair down to my belly button just last week, but I finally decided to cut it to just the top of my breasts, and I feel like I look more mature, serious, and stylish. Plus hair that you keep cutting remains softer and healthier.|`|J6Tdrd8Xaa	Don't bother love, hair that long always looks square, dull and old-fashioned. Anything longer than elbow length and the appearance is exactly the same as if it was at elbow length anyway.|`|Cmnn78Gaaa	8 months to a year, depending on how fast your hair grows.
2W14u0xoaa	No, not at all. I find that those tops look best on people with smaller boobs. I have a C cup and those tops don't offer much support for me.

I'd maybe skip out the first day or three, just because it might hurt to pull your facial muscles like you do to apply some eye makeup. <br>  <br>  The only thing you might need to stop doing is drawing the brows, but really, since the barbell goes under the skin of the brow, other than irritating it/causing pain (which isn't the ideal thing to do), there should be no problem.|`|TQ2lQedZaa	you can easily do that. Of course you dont have to stop wearing makeup.

l46COY9eaa	Oh yeah! I think everyone has drawn on themselves at least once in their life! Henna is ok, but I don't like that they are only like 1 or 2 colors. I had a friend draw me a beautiful design for a tat once, but by the time I saved up enough money I kept spending it on clothes! Seriously I like tats on some people, but I know my personality and anything odd or new on my body, I tend to focus on and can't ignore it (ink drawing, scab, scar, etc) so I decided that a real tat would just drive me insane because I would never just let it become part of me.  So, you can do what some people do, and go to a real tattoo shop, some of them will just draw on you (for a small fee) and then you have a nice, temporary tattoo, at least you could see if you liked how it looked in the area you get it, before going for the real thing.|`|AbkJZchdaa	Lol i used fake tattoos before and they look preety real|`|PQzrsXsKaa	Oh wow. I just had a dream last night that I was drawing tattoos on people using glitter pens. Then I knocked down several trees, trapping my father in the bathroom. We had to cut up the trees, put them in the back of the truck, and take them somewhere, like a gas station or something... And then I think we were running from my mother in the truck... and she was scary...    Anyway... o.0    Henna is awesome for temps. And sharpies. ;)|`|gx8iF0lfaa	air brush really looks authentic...henna is also good but after a few weeks it will fade as will aribrush i would go with airbrush becuase it looks authentic (it fades faster though)    And yes i used to draw on myself even though my mom would yell at me! *smile*|`|LjWpo57Maa	henna is good. you can buy it at craft stores. you can use a little bit and when it starts to fade, go over it again. if you keep going over it, it lasts longer when you stop going over it.     air brush is also good, but i've had it and it always rubbed off in a week. henna lasts for atleast 2 weeks!    sharpies are probably the easiest and most inexpensive way. if you're going to do sharpie, then make sure you have a fan, sometimes the edges blurr otherwise!    i have drawn them on myself.   hope this helped,

hLdIO43Xaa	First of all, you need knowledge about clothing construction as well as drawing so you can properly convey your ideas and know that they are possible. You should have an eye out for applying to a fashion school like FIT---fashion institute of technology in New York City after high school.

"is it hard to become a fashion designer"    you can probobly name a good 20 or so top designers off the top of your head,right?    now think about how many people are in college at FIDM or the ny school of fashion..or the countless other schools for fashion majors    thousands right?    what im trying to say is you rrally really have to have just the natural skill and start looking at internships maybe at local department stores (im currently involved in one at nordstrom..im 16)    take drawing classesnl now..join or start a fashion club at school...something to get your foot in the door early.    so you.see to answer your question..yes it is hard to become a fashion designer....that is unless you land a role on THE HILLS...then you can have anything you want..including adding designer to your resume :]

ORluWHGAaa	1. Picking out the right dress can be a nerve wrecking. The first step to picking out a dress is first decide on what kind style you are looking for. Decided on whether you want a short or long dress. For a winter formal or dance, I would recommend wearing a mid to short length dress, because it is more comfortable to dance in. Next its time search for your dress! Go to stores, online websites, and don t forget to look in magazines for inspiration. Always try on several dresses before making your pick. My top tip to finding a dress, is find a dress that fits your personal style and that you feel beautiful in.  2. Hair is the second most important aspect of planning for a winter formal. What I would do was go through hair magazines and look for ideas. When you find a hairstyle you like, take the picture to your hairdresser and try it out. You can also re create the hairstyle, yourself at home.  3. If wearing makeup, I would recommend going to a mall makeup counter and ask they do make up application for events. If they do offer that service, than make appointment for the day of your event. Preferably you want to go to a makeup counter that you is oyur favorite or at least familiar with the products. Makeup counters offer this service typically for free or for a small price. This not only allows you to get your makeup done by a professional, but also allows you try out new products.  4. Find the right shoes that are comfortable. find something that is not super high and also bring a pair of flats too
De6n2MaIaa	they're just another useless fashion statement.|`|ISKM1z8iaa	Um nope. If I were you, I wouldn't bother.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	They are comfortable and do keep you warm. However, I have some from payless too and they are as good as the real ones. I say get knockout one...if you don't want to spend all the money on the real uggs. But, if you live in a cold place then go for it.|`|GKJEgidzaa	Hey, I have Ugg boots, but I have 'EMU' Uggs at the moment, after my real uggs fell apart, they are an australian brand, and Im not sure... but I think they may have been around before the 'real' Ugg boots.   They are still not cheap, because the quality is so high. You just need to search for them on google.   The sole on the EMU UGGS is actually better.      Edit: Many people think Uggs are ugly, but at the end of the day, its how you wear them that counts. I have seen them on chavs and though 'oh lords'. But I've also seen them on others and though, 'ooo'.   Plus, they are just the coziest things ever, so soft. And good for your feet.

dyHKPlgZaa	they dont last that long and they turn you orange :/|`|hj952SLyaa	If you are going to get a spray tan dont get st tropez everyone bigs it up but its not actually that great th ebest one would be fake bake and it will stain your sheets if you dont let it dry but if it is dry it should be ok remeber to wear loose clothing|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Hello. I work at a tanning salon. First of all. You WONT turn orange. If you where getting sprayed back in the 80's yeah maybe you would be orange but its 2009 and they have better ingredient. The use a derivative of brown sugar to give you a brown color, NOT orange. Anyways...    If you get a personal air brush the salon can make you as light or as dark as you want to be!    Just make sure you exfoliate as much as possible before getting it done so the solution can soak into your skin better!      They last 4 to 7 days depending on how you shower and no they don't rub off on your bed sheets!|`|YgPYv4OPaa	spray tans turn you orange .|`|WKxuvTMIaa	spray tans are blotchy and orange.... they dont look too good... just go tanning in a tanning bed|`|4Pa8TnLeaa	mm tanning bed is a better option   it will look even more orange against your pale skin|`|GKJEgidzaa	Spray tans are a disaster, go to a reputable beauty salon and get a fake bake! I have them for special occasions, the colors adapts to your own skin tone, I am fair and blonde, and the color always ends up perfect for me.|`|NCl7B7diaa	You can get a spray tan done by a professional at a tanning salon and they will tell you everything you need to know!  Or you can buy self tanners. I like the gradual self tanner by Vaseline. Seeing as you have pale skin that might be best (a gradual one) so you arent orangy. I have turned orange before using certain types of self tanners so ask around.lol.   You have to let the tanner dry before you put your clothes on because it can stain your clothes and no it shouldnt mark your bed sheets unless your skin is still wet.  Good Luck|`|gx8iF0lfaa	DONT DO IT! if your pale or very light skinned it will make you look like an orange!    just be comfortable with yourself...pale skin is beautiful|`|kqM33CFNaa	I dont think that you can get better than St Tropez, it is a spary tan in a bottle and is available in boots or superdrug or any other stores like them. I should last strong for 2-3 days and start to fade after that. If  you allow it to dry properly and follow the insructions then u shud be fine. It oonly comes in one colour its ajustable to all skin colours and tones.    Instructions for use :  1. When you have ur shower or bath the day you are goin to apply the spray tan exfoliate your entire skin (i would use a sponge or scruchie sponge) with showergell or body wash whatever you use to remeve all dead skin, then use body cream or mosturiser when you get out of the water and have dryed and aply all over.    2. Then spray the st tropez at an upright angle and evenly spray it all way over (may be easier for someone to help you out specialy for the back area).     3.Leave 10 mins to dry then you are ready to get dressed. It will develope in a hour or so then develpe graduly.     Try the lotion st tropez tan too its just as good.   For a moisturiser lotion tanner try Hawwian tropic moisturised lotion its in a yellow bottle and is my secret weopen lol xx    http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...|`|QKh5gCkfaa	I would get a St Tropez spray tan they are the best. And yes it will come off on the bed sheets as you are unable to have a shower for 24 hours after.

I mean, there are some things that are always considered pretty and you can't do much to change your face shape, but if you hav a great body, great hair, and great style, as well as wearing the right make-up and keeping your skin good, almost everyone looks pretty... the only difference is that it takes a little more work!|`|gXrwqoTGaa	I think that everyone, especially girls, can make themselves pretty. These days there are so many products and services aimed at making a woman beautiful that it is almost impossible for a woman to still be ugly if she used all of her resources, excluding plastic surgery.  Getting their hair done, wearing stylish clothes, and accentuating their good features with makeup can make a big difference. If you don't believe it just look at when prom comes and notice the difference in how people look on prom than how they look on a regular day. The difference is that the people who are not lucky enough to be born pretty have to work hard to be good looking.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well everyone is pretty, it is all of the matter of confidence.

hxM8AXVRaa	I use Cetaphil liquid soap. I have extremly dry skin. face and body. My Dr recommended it and it doesn't dry me out like regular soap.   Dove did the same thing to my face. I have been using Delicate Balance by Merle Norman for my face. It's a moisturizer for sensitive skin.|`|0zxiLWdcaa	I'm an esthetician and I can tell you bar soaps are really bad for your skin! It strips your acid mantle which protects your skin. You should switch to a face wash for your skin type, I use dermalogica. No matter what face wash you decide to go with you should still moisturize every day even if you have oily skin. At the very least, wear sunscreen during the day after you wash your face.|`|OtYAkRrRaa	Sounds like you need a moisturizing skin cream. It could be because your skin is changing due to the weather, (if you're in a cold climate) Maybe allergies. I suggest first to drink lots more water. It worked for me and it helps a lot. Next, Try other white soaps with fewer perfumes if possible like ivory. Sometimes you can't help if a soap dries out your skin. It's what you do afterwards that can make a difference. Try Ponds dry skin cream. I use it everyday and have been for years. It keeps my skin moisturized all day. It has a light scent.  Hope this helps.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I use Spectro Gel.  You can find it for different skin type.  I have a very dry and sensitive skin and it works for me(that's for the face).  As for the body, when the weather is cold and my skin becomes itchy, I use Aveeno but that soap is very expensive. In average, one bar for approximately $5.00|`|CNgVwJgEaa	I use oilatum shower gel and aqeuous cream.     Both were given to me by the doc, but you can buy them from the chemist too, it is AMAZING for dry skin (I have mine for v.dry exzema on my arms) but they're for sensitive skin so it will be fine for your skin too.    Also, just for moisturiser for face try doublebase - that is the best moisturiser in the world, but you only need a tiny bit cus it's so moisturising and 2nd to that get simple.     Good luck!

aHWGRNbDaa	Aw! Auburn would look adorable. If you want to go a brunette I would definitly go for Auburn or Warm Amber like Jessica Alba. I think Amber would be the best for you. You should think about it for at least a week before you do it trust me.

If you want to go w/ something other than pants then I would suggest a cute spring/summer dress w/ a cardigan (if it's still chilly where you live).      The trick w/ the dress is finding something that is simple yet very girly, the contrast of a girly dress and the leather shoes will actually strike a balance.     Maybe something like this....

You are drying out your poor skin so bad. Neutrogena contains sodium laurel sulfate which is not a good ingredient you want in your skin care product and will cause your skin to produce MORE oil, then you are in the pool so much your skin is really lacking that natural and essential oil your skin is needing. Toss your face washes and look for a cleanser that does not contain harsh ingredients, look at burts bees products. Wash only at night, and tone in the morning and after the pool. Find a good moisturizer to put on in the morning, after the pool and at night. Your skin is so deprived of moisture and oils its breaking out. Look out for fragrances and dyes in your moisturizer and dont use a body lotion. Your face has a different PH than the rest of your skin and is more delicate. Good Luck!
OqD4Z6wpaa	are you using tapers?<br>  dont just put a 4 gauge plug in, you might tear your ear or get a blow out. just take a hot shower, and then when you get out massage ky jelly or vitamin e oil on your ears and put it on the taper and just slide it in.|`|m8nCrzuVaa	I had the same problem a while ago. Hold off on it for about a week or two. Just don't rush it. While you're sitting around, literally play with your gauge. Even if they're healed, a little movement in them help your ears become use to it more. <br>  It's different for everyone. Just give it some more time. :]|`|joA5Rcyzaa	well if you're not using a taper (said above) then you should be<br>  <br>  and if it wont go though your ear then give it more time<br>  <br>  and scar tissue buildup can make it harder to stretch so be sure you're stretching properly (ie. not skipping sizes or stretching too soon)|`|bAYVSfdJaa	A 4g what?  Gauge is a size, so knowing what type of jewelry you're using would help.  Hopefully you're not just trying to shove a 4g plug in there.  Use tapers to ease the plug in - and make sure that it's not double flared.  <br>  <br>  Also: Petroleum jelly isn't the best lubricant.
VPf2uJFsaa	what a MAJOR coincidence.<br>  i just put that stuff in my hair, but anyways<br>  i use it a lot like right after i take a shower, i towel<br>  dry it then put that in. it makes my hair really soft<br>  and shiny , & even makes it smell reeaaally good! :)<br>  how do you use it? all you do is just try to distribute it<br>  all through your hair, if your like me who uses a lot of hot tools<br>  focus on the ends. i suggest not using this stuff when your hair is dry, it makes it a little sticky but i dunno your hair may be different from mines.i put this in my hair everynight and trust me it leaves your hair feels fresh and shiny. how much you put in your depends. just put in a quarter-size amount. too much won't do any good. -___-'<br>  well anyways i hope i helpeed you.<br>  :)|`|4vXZbvgSaa	All it does is condition your hair. Then you wash it out... simple as that. <br>  <br>  If you want to try something, rinse your hair with water only. Then coat all of your hair in a lot of conditioner. Tie a plastic bag around your hair, and go to sleep with a towel on your pillow. Rinse out in the morning. It will make your hair silky and healthy =]|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	I use a spray leave in conditioner, but a different brand name and in hair products that can change ALOT.mine detangles and adds shine and texture.  It locks in my curl, too.  I can go a while without washing (few days!) but i wash mine EVERY day anyways|`|EqksHuAWaa	Leave-in conditioner is a fairly self-explanatory hair care product. Unlike conditioners for your hair that you might use in the shower, leave-in conditioner is applied after you shower, and is left in the hair until the next washing. Many hair conditioners are fairly dense or contain oils, and you may notice that they’re difficult to wash out of the hair to get that squeaky clean feel. Leave-in conditioner tends to rely not on oils, (though some do use oil) which could make the hair look greasy, but instead use products like glycerin, which can help calm tangled hair or impart a little moisture to dry hair.<br>  <br>  There are huge numbers of leave-in conditioners on the market. Thus, judging how effectively they work is difficult, since some are superior to others. If you’re looking to get rid of tangled hair, simple conditioners like No More Tangles?: make by Johnsons? is probably just as likely to be effective as more pricey brands. You will note extraordinary variance in prices, from about $2-3 US Dollars (USD) for brands like Johnsons? or Suave? to over $20 USD for the same size bottle made by famous hair designers like Jonathon, or even over $50 USD for leave-in conditioners from companies like Ojon?.<br>  <br>  Some other hair products have leave-in conditioner built in. If you’re using hair gel, mousse, styling cream, pomade, or wax, the light oils or glycerin in these products will add extra moisture to the hair and may protect the hair slightly from exposure to the sun, or from damage caused by styling. It usually isn’t necessary to use a leave-in conditioner and another styling product too.<br>  <br>  Leave-in conditioners that have lots of oil, and some do, may make the hair feel weighted down or simply leave it looking greasy. It’s a good idea to test out a few to see which one seems to provide moisture without making hair look unwashed. At beauty supply stores you can often get samples of different brands for less than a dollar, or even sometimes for free, so you can give a product a test before committing to buying hair product you won’t end up using.<br>  <br>  Hair stylists often say that moisturizing the hair is just as important as moisturizing the skin. If you feel like your hair is a little dry, it may be time to investigate a few leave-in conditioners that might be right for you. Within this range of products, you’ll find those made specifically for vegans, those with more chemical ingredients (usually grocery store brands), different scents, and different oils. It can be overwhelming to be faced with so much choice. There are plenty of less well-known brands in the $10-20 USD range that are made of natural ingredients with fewer unpronounceable chemicals, and there are the old standbys like No More Tangles?, which though they do have more chemicals, also tend to work pretty well.|`|XuU2Fv5aaa	well I use leave in conditioner also and I also have curly hair. <br>  To use leave in conditioner you just out it in your hair and don't wash it out. It keeps your hair moist and less puffy. You can put as much as you want but 2 quarter size dollops should be good. Put it on after your shower it settles better in your hair that way. It is kinda like mousse|`|dxeb0BfBaa	My only advice is: don't use it. I would recommend you stay well away from commercial products like Pantene & Garnier Fructis. The short term effect they have on your hair is brilliant but in the long run they actually make your problem a million times worse. Professional products on the other hand may take a few washes before you notice the difference but the effects are long term & although they may be a bit pricey they are extremely concentrated so in the long run its an all round win-win situation.<br>  <br>  Here are a few of my favourite products for your hair type:<br>  <br>  TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Moisturiser(best quality & results)<br>  Nexxus Curl Energee(more affordable)<br>  <br>  Leave In conditioner helps moisturise, smooth & protect hair, at least that's what the professional 1s do. They arent crunchy & with good 1s it looks like you have no product in your hair but it looks & feels soft. You would apply approx. a hazelnut size amount of the conditioner. Rub it between your hands & imagine you're trying to clean the product from your hands by wiping it in your hair. It has no affect once its washed out. It temporarily moisturises in the same way moisturiser for the face or body does.The commercial 1s tend to make your hair look healthy but not by moisturising the hair. They often use some form of silicon to coat the hair & make the cuticles lay flat so it appears to be healthy & moisturised. The main problem with silicon is that it doesn't wash off the hair & so leaves a nasty build up on it which means your hair cannot absorb moisture from conditioner.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Leave in conditioner is a cream that you put in your hair after washing it. You don't rinse it out. Basically, just put enough in to cover your hair, like you would conditioner or mousse. It probably won't make your hair look any different, it's mainly used for girls who have dry hair, because since it isn't rinsed out, your hair has longer to soak up the moisture. It will most likely make your hair feel softer within a couple uses. If you're unsure about using it, after you shampoo and condition with your regular conditioner, put a little leave-in on your ends. That way you can get a better idea of how well it works and how you like it.

wT6ZcHRyaa	1) You're gonna have to go to the salon. They'll use special products so it doesn't turn orange again. And I'm not sure why people are saying prices on here, but if your hair isn't even past your eyes, it will most certainly NOT be $100-$150. Unless the salon you go to is ridiculously overpriced. I'd say about $50. Maybe less, maybe more. It depends on where you go.<br>  2) I'm not a big fan of hair colors that don't match skin tones (black hair on super pale guys, blonde hair on super dark guys, etc.) But I don't know what you look like, so who knows, you might be ablt to pull it off. And if you can pull it off, more power to ya. :]<br>  3) I used to have the bottom layers of my hair bleached out and dyed green (it looked really cool though, I promise) and basically the only thing I can tell you about it is that the bleach tickles alot on your scalp. That's about the only thing I can think of that's important...haha.<br>  Good luck! I'm sure it'll turn out fine. :]|`|bjW1BZBXaa	1. Obviously bleaching/dyeing. Go to your stylist, this will cost $100-$150.<br>  2&3 When my friends and I see asians/blacks/hispanics with blonde hair, we laugh!  As for me, I'm part Asian, and although i'm part White I don't like light hair on myself. Not that it wouldn't look right, it's just that I am proud to have my beautiful silky black hair.|`|4vXZbvgSaa	Certain people can look great with blonde hair, and I'm sure you will too!<br>  <br>  Going completely blonde is a long process. Go to a professional stylist to do the job right. It might take a couple weeks and will look kind of crazy at first, but once all the processing is done, the results will look fantastic. Good luck!|`|4EOIcRYzaa	well, with black/dark hair its hard to get it to go all the way blonde without hitting that orange-brown color. if u leave a strong bleach in for more than the time it says on the box, (just a really long time), then it will turn out pretty blonde. i'm also asian, but im japanese and i tried to get blonde highlights and the first time i tried it, it turned orange but the second time i left it in for a long time and it turned out blonde. it also damages your hair, so its up to you if you decide to do that. i think there may be some other ways to get your hair lighter though. well, good luck! :]]|`|VPf2uJFsaa	aigoo, most korean guys with Blonde hair<br>  just look like plain old FOBS [fresh off the boat].<br>  but thats just my opinion. hmm, there are a lot of cute korean guys<br>  that have blonde hair, like Jaejoong from DBSK looked pretty alright.<br>  you just need to know how to work it, know what i mean?<br>  oh and to answer one of your questions one way to get ACTUAL blonde hair that won't turn into any other color is to go to a salon.<br>  trust me it'll be worth it. you'll get the color that you want! yeah it maybe a little pricey but if you really want your hair to be blonde that bad.. :)<br>  <br>  hmm, SOME asian guys with blonde hair look hot, not all of them, some asain guys with blonde hair actually look like they're gay.<br>  :| and again most[if not all] of them look like fobs. ;) teeheeee|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	Hoping I can help you out:D<br>  You want to spend a little extra money to get it done at a salon, A good one will tell you how to keep the color, how ot style it and care for it the best, pluss they know what blonde is(:<br>  Ppl assume that asians with blonde hair (male) are either gey or cence/skater.  BUT you can make it on the edge classy depending on how you dress.  I think some are hot and can pull it off... where as others need to look in a mirror.!  BUT at the end of the day you should go for it- it grows back, it fades, and better to do it now rather than when you hit50(;

Because of this, the name Megan does kind of seem to plain for you. However, I do believe that you deserve a classy kind of name... and to be honest, the names you provided sound to diva-esque to be taken seriously! Why don't you try taking a classic name and spelling it differently? Like Abbey Rose, Molli Rae, etc etc.    To change your name, you will have to go through some serious legal papers and spend a ton of money. Why don't you just start going by a name you chose? It's not like everyone's going to be looking at your birth certificate, after all. Just try it out.    Hope I helped. XD|`|XmITJyQsaa	Your really pretty :]    Yeah i think you suit your name!!

Then, use a moisturizing chap stick or other such product, and preferably one with SPF. Also, if you have to use lipstick, only use a moisturizing kind, and use chapstick under it.

Another option is Nexxus Heat Protexx which is on the cheaper/more affordable end of the scale. TIGI Catwalk Fashionista Spritz & Shine is great too. The best 1 I've ever used though is TIGI S Factor Flat Iron Shine Spray but it is fairly pricey. The CHS & Nexxus are the least expensive but they do the job so if your on a budget I'd go with that. Fashionista is kind of mid range & then the S factor is the most expensive.

BSU9pNUWaa	The theory behind them is the heat from the scissors will close split ends. Some what similar to cutting hair with fire, which some high end salons offer. <br>  <br>  "You can use other hair treatment products for your hair's revival, but in case of a hair cut with hot scissors, it will every single hair solder immediately. This method is good for preventing split ends. It provides healthy looking hair and luxurious fluffy hair. However, professionals advise against the hair cut with hot scissors if you want short hair."

The way i fixed it was i went to a chiropractor and they ended up sending in a mold of my foot and i got special sneakers that had better arch support, and that completely fixed my knees! <br>  Basically, if you fix the arch in your feet, i'm pretty sure if fixes your knees too. At least, that's what happened to me. The way to fix your arch is to start wearing shoes that have waaaay better arch support than high heels ;) that doesn't mean you can't wear heels ever again, it's just that you have to wear better arch-supporting shoes to get your arch back!<br>  good luck! try asking your doctor about it too, i'm sure they could help!
oCeOaH3eaa	Anything really. Just mix and match your wardrobe to find some things that go good with it. It doesn't have to match the pattern, really. It can be without a pattern, and if you go with a pattern make sure they don't clash. Leopard print is easily clashed with other prints.<br>  I'll suggest black skinnies and maybe a purple sweater... Well that's just my opinion. If you don't have black skinnies in particular then you can wear black pants it really doesn't matter...

MAtnvBT6aa	use a thick cover up that matches ur skin rly well over ur foundation if u wear any and <br>  put powder over it to set it for the whole day<br>  also duh wash ur face lol|`|idhcqr5Daa	Wash your face with a medicated acne cleanser, not a scrub.(Ex, noxema cream cleanser, clean and clear cream cleanser) Apply a hydrating toner, not a drying one.(Try The Body Shop Vitamin E toner) Then moisturize using vitamin E gel, or aloe vera gel or a water based moisturizer. If you have dark circles under your eyes, use an eye brightener cream and gently pat in with your pinky. (Try Dove Eye Brightener cream) <br>  DO NOT USE A HEAVY LIQUID FOUNDATION OR CONCEALER! No matter how bad your skin is, use a tinted moisturizer (like clinique or almay) because a)even if you have lots of skin blemishes, most of your face still does not need coverage and b)tinted moisturizers are SO easy to match to your skin tone and you will avoid the fake color look...you only need to pick if you are light, medium, or dark usually. With your fingers, dab small dots of tinted moisturizer on your chin, forehead, nose, cheeks. Use your fingertips to blend in a circular motion. Don't try and cover all your blemishes at this point - just create a sheer, base layer to cover the smallest imperfections. <br>  Now use a concealer brush (should look a bit bigger than an eyeshadow brush, and be firm but not stiff) to try and cover directly bigger imperfections with tinted moisturizer. What isn't covered, use the same brush and a liquid concealer (covergirl or maybelline) to apply the tiniest amount of concealer directly to the blemish only. Use a smaller (eyeliner brush) one if necessary. <br>  If you have any oozing or oily blemishes, use the concealer brush to apply some loose powder directly to it. Otherwise, use a natural bristle brush to apply loose powder to set the make up. Use a transparent shade of loose powder, try Clinique. Brush in a circular upward motion. <br>  If putting on the powder revealed any blemishes, use a smaller brush (eyeliner brush) and a tiny bit of tinted moisturizer to reconceal. Then set by gently dabbing some powder over. <br>  Wipe any excess powder from your brows. Curl your eyelashes and apply black mascara to the top only. Use a lengthening mascara not a thickening one---these only clump and look awful. Put a second coat on just the tips. <br>  Use a liquid cheek tint (try Benefit Brand) and put four small dots on the apples of your cheek and gently blend with your finger tip. <br>  Use a bronzer (only a few shades darker than your own skin!) and apply lightly to hairline, nose and chin. Use your fingertip and apply some to your eyelid outer corners. <br>  Use a pink or red tinted lip gloss. <br>  Use as little makeup as you can.....only add more if you need it. Don't be tempted to use a thick concealer all over your face to hide your acne. This looks awful and draws attention to your bad skin. <br>  Especially with applying makeup to blemish directly: use just a tiny tiny bit, you should hardly be able to see it at all! Do not surround the entire area of the blemish--this is just excess makeup in the wrong spot. <br>  Do not pick your skin! It makes your skin bumpy and irritated and you cannot cover puffiness with makeup! <br>  If you have a large pimple you must accept you cannot conceal shape with makeup or anything else! You can only conceal color, dryness, oiliness. But if you put just a tiny brushing of bronzer over at the end this may reduce its appearance. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|a4rhTUeyaa	I use L'oreal tue match and it works amazingly. You can purchase it at Shoppers Drug Mart. It is around $10. You just have to choose you shade and apply.  Make sure you don't use too much because it will close your pores and make you break out even more. Before you go to bed make sure you wash your face thoroughly.|`|vRSgCK2iaa	If I were you I'd try Dream Matte Foundation (At least I think that's the name.) It works for me, but try to get various acne creams. Right now I'm using Clean And Clear, it work's pretty nicely.<br>  <br>  This will probably work.
rDNBcYZGaa	Find a foundation ever so slightly darker than your own, and carefully (with an applicator sponge), use the darker foundation on the sides of your nose. Make sure to blend the edges of the dark foundation with a mix of your normal foundation around the edges, then apply your normal foundation everywhere else. Use a lighter color (I usually just use a light beige eyeshadow), along the bridge of your nose to accentuate it.|`|ky1is4HCaa	contouring your nose look it up on youtube.|`|4oA5WAV0aa	sorry your nose is made out of bone and cartilage... it is pretty much not going to change.|`|HEvdQEa4aa	while having ur chin up,,<br>  <br>  run into a brick wall.!|`|2dya7YeKaa	Surgery is your only option.

4qyMF86iaa	go to the salon and get it fixed|`|Ti476VHkaa	Go to a hair solon and get it fixed. That's my suggestion.|`|wT6ZcHRyaa	Well my number one suggestion is to go to a salon and have them fix it.<br>  But if you don't want to do that, buy a box of SEMI-PERMANENT hair dye in whatever color you want. But shoot for a darker color, cause if it's a light brown or something, your roots will still be lighter than the rest of your hair. Since the dye is semi-permanent, it'll just absorb in the bleached areas. It might not make sense to you, but trust me, permanent will wash out in one week tops.

RH7K4rsmaa	No. You said it looks like sand paper, considering you can't even shave your legs - this doesn't sound like a good option for you. You might want to talk to your doctor for a referral to a dermatologist. Even though waxing leaves your skin irritated, it might be the best solution because waxing will thin out the hair. Also, you might want to consider finding an after shave balm, something that will calm your skin after you remove the hair. There are tons of good products for sale - search "after shave balms" on the internet for options.

Get a h2Ocean at hottopic.. clean it with that<br>  OR go to your piercer to ask whats wrong. <br>  <br>  But if you just got it done, that sounds pretty normal.<br>  Still, you should know how to care for a piercing before you got it done.|`|2dya7YeKaa	First off, your links are non functional.<br>  <br>  Second, do not put Neosporin on a piercing.  It specifically says on the package that you are not supposed to use it on puncture wounds.<br>  <br>  Do not take the jewelry out, if it IS infected all that will do is trap the infection in your nose and that is no good.<br>  <br>  If it were infected it would be red, hot and painful to the touch and oozing pus.  To me it sounds like it is just irritated, probably due to the way you are cleaning it.  All you need to do to keep a new piercing clean is sea salt soaks about 3 times a day.  Mix 1/8 tsp non-iodized sea salt in 8 OZ of warm water.  Dunk a cotton ball in the solution.  Hold the cotton ball to your piercing for 10 minutes or so.<br>  <br>  If you are not cleaning your piercing, do not touch it under any circumstances.  Do not rotate it.  Do not mess with it.  If it gets worse, go back to your piercer and have them take a look at it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Please grow into a WOMAN .,,,,,,, <br>  Then get a tattoo of who you really are ....|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Spice it up by adding color to it- the brighter the colors, the better, in my opinion.|`|slppTZi1aa	A way to make your stars different would be (depending on where your getting the tattoo) would be to make them in negative space, so the star will be the color of your skin and the ink will be colored around it so it looks like shooting stars. I have that design on my foot with black ink around it, i didnt intentionally want shooting stars when i thought of it but it ended up looking like that.. its really creative and cute, its popular in big pieces but looks just as good as its own small piece.

It is basically good to eat healthy, drink lots of water and good sleep. But to be able to really lighten skin, diet and natural products should be complimented with other products such as supplements and/or topical solutions.<br>  <br>  Have you heard about a product used by celebrities to lighten and maintain their flawless glowing skin?<br>  <br>  Its called Glutathione, try to reseach on google about "glutathione and skin whitening"<br>  <br>  Glutathione is a compound that possess antioxidant ability, its actually called the master-antioxidant.<br>  <br>  It also has another ability, it lightens the skin<br>  <br>  Read some of the articles here for more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.whitening-capsules.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitening-capsules.com/</a>
5Kr2szSsaa	well whether you want the lectures or not your going to get them ain't yah?!<br>  right do u know how to build a tattoo machine? if not dont even bother most tattooing kits the armature bar needs to be adjusted because there usually isn't enough resistance.<br>  most tattooing kits online come with polymer inks which are not good for you, organic ink is the best way to go.<br>  i have a tattoo by someone who used a tattoo machine online and he was to quote you "great at design and not stupid" and well to cut a long story short i had a very very bad experience i have a scar not a tattoo, i was close and this is where is gets scary i was close to having my foot amputated because it got infected because of the polymer ink and the armature bar wasn't set right so it pretty much dug trenches in my skin.<br>  this isn't a lecture, but that's how your gonna see it, if u do get a kit, i hope it goes wrong to teach you the lesson, that without the proper training...you know jack ****.|`|VhhZXqA3aa	IM SORRY I DONT KNOW WHAT IT CONTAINS BUT A SAFE SITE YOU CAN TRY IS EBAY I HOPE IT HELPPED|`|8THz1sp9aa	don't waste your money.|`|clInlnIqaa	You can not get a professional tattoo kit online. All the kits you will find online are crappy.|`|0X7DWnyeaa	There's nothing wrong with wanting to learn how to tattoo. I suggest that since you've braved piercing yourself that you practice tattooing on fake skin. Some kits come with "practice skin". I don't know of any websites off hand but I know if you pick up any tattoo magazine there are plenty of ads to buy ink, kits, equipment, etc. <br>  <br>  It's really not safe to be piercing or tattooing with out the know how. I would suggest that you find a shop in your area and become an apprentice to learn these professions from a professional. You wouldn't want to pierce or tattoo yourself or someone else and have something major go wrong.|`|Cavz3kAPaa	Haha, you know what my favourite part was? The part where you're you say you're not stupid. Because clearly you are if you want to tattoo yourself. Just because your good at design and piercings doesn't mean your going to be good to tattoo. Do you know how deep to go? If you press to hard, you could get a halo effect. You probably don't have a steady hand, so your lines are going to be straight. If it's got colour, you probably can't do a good job at shading. You might think we are rude, but we are trying to save you regret, and save you from making a horrible (and possibly expensive) mistake when you need to get it removed.<br>  <br>  But because you want the actual question answered, here goes:<br>  <br>  Where to get a tattoo kit from:<br>  Probably the 'scratcher' that works from their basement. I'm sure they have some old used needles you could have. No one with an ounce of credibility would sell something like this.|`|z98RlStyaa	if you do,<br>  your ARE going to mess up. and you ARE going to cry and feel bad. and your gonna go though a shatlode of $$$$ to get it off. and it wont even get completely off.<br>  <br>  just let a professional do it dude.

JCG36VRVaa	i'd do them scattered through out all the layers of your hair  ( including bangs if u have them)<br>  <br>  doing just the top layer looks tacky IMO|`|sm7DJGOoaa	im getting my hair like this;<br>  <br>  light bonde on top,<br>  dark brown underneeth,<br>  purple highlights on eachside.<br>  <br>  if youo have straight hair where it up in a high pony, its very cute like that. and i love purple because it donst fade into some wierd color. <br>  <br>  ex. pink fades into orange.<br>  <br>  good luck,(:|`|7kFt3YQ5aa	Personally, I'd say put some on top AND underneath. That way you can always see them.<br>  Consider how you typically wear your hair, how they'll show up when it's in those styles, and how obvious you want them to be.

a7c40583290789c6ea0453de5e51b445aa	use a straightening shampoo. I've tried all the drugstore brands (Pantene, Herbal Esscences, Aussie) but ive found the BEST straightening shampoo is from Sunsilk. It's called Straight to perfection and its really cheap. also get the conditioner and the heat defense cream|`|KQjBLyU3aa	My hair was like that, it was really straight but when I chopped most of it off then it started growing in ugly and wavy. I tried all sorts of serums and shampoos and stuff, but the best treatment for me was to get a straight perm. However, my hair is insanely unmanagable. If your hair isn't hair to manage, then I'd go ahead and use the straightening serums and such. Good luck!|`|qYTYcVGGaa	use sunsilk straightening shampoo- my hair is also retarded wavy but it works for me also sstop putting your hair in buns and it might be straight again|`|Cmnn78Gaaa	go to a salon and ask them for a perm and say you want it straightend, it will naturlay straiten you hair again.|`|0KtFtnZVaa	Grow your hair out. It probably pulled strait due to the weight when it was long.

slppTZi1aa	If you want surface piercings not anchors where i go its 50 per piercing, a dermal anchor is more, and that is just one stud that sticks out. I would actually recomend a dermal anchor because if you plan on having this long term your body will reject it soon after a year. I had my nape pierced which is a surface piercing and it started to reject after not even a year and 1/2 so i took it out. Also, the anchor is less common and i think its wayy cuter!<br>  <br>  You should look at them, if not the surface is cute too, but not very long term. Oh, and make sure the piercer is using tygon for a surface piercing.. its the best material to use when doing those piercings.|`|JrLyMfDdaa	as far as cost, it depends on the studio, but shouldn't cost any less than 100-200 to get both sides done (a reputable, experienced shop will cost more, but its been my experience that you get what you pay for with tattoos and piercings).  surface piercings take a long time to heal, especially on the part of the body that you're thinking about doing.  they also have a huge tendency to migrate, meaning that the skin will push out the jewelry slowly over time, basically rejecting it.  this normally leaves a nasty scar, and can leave the area unable to be re-pierced, even after healing.<br>  <br>  oh, and not to be negative but its "collarbones"|`|L0u3uEJLaa	i don't know how much they cost but they do look cool one of my friends got her cheek pierced and it looked nice.the down side is you can only have them in for a couple of months.|`|KqBlgD6Xaa	45-60 dollars for one.|`|ss48BEk5aa	well, most places charge about $40 per surface piercing, might be able to get a good deal for 2 at a time. (I know a place in Fillmore CA that only charges $25!!!!) www.myspace.com/fillmoretattoo
s90jW3rwaa	Some people believe dairy products are bad for acne because they contain hormones, and crazy hormones can be the cause of acne so theoratically dairy products would make it worse. If you are currentely eating a lot of dairy, I think you should try maybe not eating dairy products for a week and if your acne improves, you might want to consider cutting it out completely. If you do do this, you might need to get your calcium intake from something else. <br>  Otherwise, 1 or 2 servings a day is okay.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Just do the amount of servings you as an individual are suppose to have in one day. Go to mypyramid.com/org I am unsure and enter in your age and weight and maybe height. They will give you are a chart that you can follow. But you can eat dairy products and just drink the daily recommended 8 to 10 glasses of water. The water flushes out the toxins and oils from our body. Instead of it exiting from the pores in our skin, making acne, it exits out in our urine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|1yQJlon8aa	There is no link between foodstuffs of any kind and acne. Too much dairy, eating chocolate, fried foods or cake will not cause acne, or make it any worse.<br>  <br>  All of these myths are purely old wives tales.|`|q6r3dByraa	No it shouldn't just make sure you drink a lot of water as well. Also, make sure you at least get an acne fighting cleanser so you get all the bacteria off of your face.

DhUMjZxtaa	No it is not.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it all depends on your hair.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different.<br>  <br>  I like to buy good things that usually are always expensive but here are a few things I still buy because they work the best for me:<br>  <br>  Mascara. I have tried every single mascara out there, whether I paid less than $10 or $30.<br>  <br>  Namely, Clinique and Bad Gal Lash by Benefit. Each averaging about $20 a tube.<br>  <br>  I always seem to go back to my first love: Maybelline Volum Express Mascara very black (navy blue tube) it NEVER lets me down as every other single mascara I have used did. Even right down to when I need to buy a new one it still works GREAT!<br>  <br>  Another thing..SHAMPOO<br>  <br>  I always seem to LOVE pantene..any kind, whichever you need for your hair, it seems that no matter what kind of hair you have, pantene always does the trick<br>  <br>  I think for shampoo, stick to regulars (like my fav. pantene), but when it comes to styling products, I find ones that are more expensive (salon grade, like CHI), always work for me.|`|MAtnvBT6aa	no<br>  its not worth it<br>  i like pantene, garnier fructis, aussie, dove, or tresseme<br>  they all workk pretty good for me|`|QrCqqqtDaa	Keratase shampoo is also known to most by it's original name, butter.|`|8UN4Fr0Faa	smells like cheese
JfumPukYaa	Yes, that is fine..its the steam from the water evaporating.  Of course, flat ironing you hair isn't good for it, but its not worse than any other flat iron out there.|`|KQjBLyU3aa	Yeah, when it sizzles thats because the water is evaporating. The heat of the iron does that to the water....|`|qYTYcVGGaa	yes its ok-but i suggest fdoing it when yur hair is damp and nt fully wet. you might get electrocuted|`|B2jIiOwnaa	Hair is more fragile when wet and it isn't a good idea to flat iron wet hair, even if the packaging says you can.  The damage will be more severe than it has to be.  The sizzling and smoking isn't good.  If you see or smell smoke, that means something is burning.<br>  <br>  While your hair is damp, apply a product that protects your hair from heat.  The ingredients should include dimethicone or panthenol.  Let your hair air dry or use a blow dryer and then use the flat iron.<br>  <br>  CHI flat irons work OK at first, but they break easily and have short "lifespans".  But--the CHI Silk Infusion serum is excellent.<br>  <br>  P.S.--Don't worry to much.  You only ironed one section.  I doubt the damage is bad.|`|voYxjeTCaa	yeah its fine, thats just what wet2dry straighteners do. You should try to get a special hair products from the store to make sure your hair doesnt get too dry. There are tons of different shampoos, conditioners, and creams you can buy. My hair has done that alot though and my hair isnt dry or damaged at all(: Hope i was able to help|`|2lqqRcMvaa	Yeah I think its fine because when I had a wet to dry straightener, it did the same thing. I switched though because i heard it can b bad for your hair.|`|MAtnvBT6aa	even if u have a wet to strait flat iron its better to do it dry because when u do it wet the steam kills the hair faster|`|dLPFPjleaa	yea. its just the water in your hair evaporating. its fine. just dont do it too close to your head.. it WILL burn you (and believe me, it hurts!). Also, your hair shouldn't be too wet, otherwise it just gets all freaky. <br>  <br>  PS. you should get some heat protectant spray (even when your blow drying, it really helps, i use TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray, and it works really well.)<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!<br>  :)|`|uCD2Uc4Baa	don't use that it ruins your hair. invest in a new straightener like a chi. and yes it is supposed to sizzle/smoke.
5bhrzIasaa	PU leather, aka Bycast Leather, is Reconstituted Leather (small leather scraps) or Bonded Leather that is layered with thick Polyurethane to give it a sheen like real leather.  The image of such a process that comes to my mind is like gluing scraps of wood together and pack it really tight to look & feel like real wood.<br>  <br>  Since it is synthetic material, it doesn't last as long as real leather.  However, for a handbag, I personally think it is ok to use.  For shoes, I wouldn't recommend it though, as shoes tend to wear out faster and Polyurethane is not a breathable material like leather.<br>  <br>  As for sheep skin....well, within the accessories industry (bags, belts, shoes, planners, etc), they classify any animal skin (cow, calf, lamb, sheep, even pig) as "leather."  <br>  <br>  Here's a link that explains the different grades of leather:<br>  <a href="http://www.bankhardts.com/Merchant/selectin1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankhardts.com/Merchant/selec...</a><br>  <br>  For handbags, it really depends on what type of look & feel you want and how much you can afford to spend.  Just because certain designer brands label certain products as Sheep Skin does not necessarily warrant charging consumers an arm-and-leg price.  After you read that link, go to different stores, from Wilson's Leather to expensive designer brands, close your eyes and feel with your hand the various textures of each grade you come across.  Don't let the trendy colors and glossy coating fool you into paying too high of a price, as they do often use glaze to give lower-grade leather a smooth, lotion-y type of false softness.  That's why I am personally wary of ordering handbags online.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps in your decisions for future purchases.<br>  Best Wishes.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	are you sure its not Pleather? which is fake leather and better because it doesnt kill the poor little animals|`|yuT6tqXraa	i think it is leather from a cow that has been puued on!! HEHEHEHEHE|`|0cagihhwaa	for prices, pu handbags is cheaper than lesther handbags. if you want to buy a cheap one, you can buy pu handbags, there are many similar handbags on ebay.com, eshopintuition.com or amazon.com or other online store. you can take a look these sites.
eJsR7BZvaa	Try Veet. In my opinion it's better than Nair. You can also try waxing if you want to. I'd recommend Sally Hansen wax strips and Veet wax strips. They're a lot easier to use and way less messy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
M0TyJcuNaa	you cant, just...be happy with whatyou got.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Brush your hair gently with preferably wooden brushes to increase hair growth and make it longer.

zpvHqzlXaa	You should wear pencil if your a beginner. It's much easier. Uhmm to apply it just lift your head back, close one eye but not all the way. Keep the other one open so you can see clearer. Rest your hand on your cheeks so your hand will be more stable. Start drawing the line at the middle of your eye and draw with small even lines.Then go back and fill in the half of the other eye. Gooood luck! :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Oh uhm for products, the one best for me is Revlon's Colour Stay. I think it's a crayon .. not a pencil. It stays on for a really long time (even if you have oily skin), so it won't smudge to the bottom and make you look like you have raccoon eyes. But the problem is that it's kind of hard to fix when you mess up. Because of course, it's "colour stay". Lol hmm.. I don't think it's the best eyeliner out there though.. Iunno I switched to liquid because all the other ones I used smudged to the bottom. But yeah.. you could buy this at a drugstore.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Get waterproof and I would begin with a pencil. you can get a cheap one at walmart for a buck even. Once you master that move on to liquid.

"Ring" style tattoos never work out as they literally wear off on the underside (palm side) of the finger where the body has an additional layer of skin.    That being said all tattoos are based based on the size, complexity and location all of which boils down to how much time and effort is required by the artist to complete the work. The only definitive answer would be to get estimates in person by local artists.

JfOuzOJGaa	If you've only had your piercing for a couple weeks, then a clearish to slightly yellow discharge is pretty normal.  If the discharge becomes greenish accompanied by really red, painful, and a warm to the touch piercing site, then that's most likely an infection.  It sounds as if everything is normal.  Just continue to clean it as you were directed by your piercer.  If you suspect that you're developing an infection, then go back to your piercer and ask their opinion on the condition of your piercing.|`|YUEVhOxsaa	In the case of any discharge around a new piercing you should remove the piercing immediately and get it checked out by a doctor as this can be a sign of an infection. Normally an infection will be apparent by inflammed and sensitive tissue around the piercing in addition to the ***** discharge you are describing.|`|knOychnyaa	i don't personally have mine done, but anyone i have talked to has said that that ends up happening.  its completely normal.  i was debating about getting it done and that is one thing that my friends told me would happen|`|11TYEOI1aa	thts normal it means tht its healing just keep cleaning it|`|IwqTI7Rfaa	You should be soaking it in a small shot glass of saline each night or twice a day for 30 min each time.  If it does not start to become un gooy in the next 2-3 days you need to call your physician or the people who pierced it and ask what to do.|`|Pnn3VgFpaa	I have got several piercings and I do think that it is an infection. Does it hurt a little bit as well?<br>  Try not to touch your piercing at all, picking it will only make it worse. Clean it with special anti bacterial soap (can get it in the supermarket) while you are under the shower. That has always done the trick for me. If it gets worse though, you might wanna go back to your piercing shop and get some more advice. In my hometown we are always welcome to do so.
69MIm6bEaa	I think that cut/style would look great on you. Just bring in a picture to show your barber/stylist so that he/she knows exactly what you want.

TN72hvpEaa	I think you should never try to cover them up. I am 24, Irish/German decent....I am girl & my parents named me Ryan. I know how it feels to be a little different than the 'normal girl' at school or whatever. My entire body including my face is full of freckles. I know you hate it now & you envy all girls with clear skin. You feel different & don't feel pretty sometimes because of it but............I guarantee that you are beautiful. As you get older you will learn that having that many freckles only makes you special and unique. Every boyfriend I've had has always told me how beautiful I am. "A face without freckles is like a night without stars" Remember that. Remember to wear a lot of sunblock in the summer time & you can use lotion with spf any other time (Every time I step outside when the sun is out, I literally get another freckle. Not just the 'cute' red irish kind. Regular brown freckles all different sizes!!!!!) K girl?|`|HV3H73UZaa	I mean if your freckles are like the second picture then I think they look fine. I know there is a type of bleach solution that you can put on to get rid of them.|`|gNvuBITqaa	I am a freckle faced girl myself.  Much similar to your pattern. When I was younger I HATED them, but now I don't mind them so much.  The girls in the first picture are gorgeous!  Their freckles are super pretty and they have gorgeous skin.    What I can tell u that makes my freckles fade (but not go away) is that I wear sunblock everyday.  Even in the winter.  Us fair skinned freckled girls have to do that.  OUr skin is sensitive to the sun and we don't tan, we just freckle.  Since wearing sunblock on my face and arms it seems my freckles have faded.  So maybe try that.  Minimum 45.    p.s. I wear sunblock not to fade my freckles but to keep me from getting wrinkles and sunspots when I'm older.
k3TCOBZhaa	i doubt that you are so overweight that you can't enjoy your life. however you feel, you shouldn't let appearance get in the way of your fun or tell yourself that you're not worth or not pretty enough to go to a concert and have a good time. <br>  <br>  but back to your question; i think that flowy dresses are really in right now, maybe a black one with red flowers like this <br>  <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?itemdescription=true&itemCount=60&startValue=1&selectedProductColor=black&sortby=&id=15347511&parentid=W_APP_DRESSES&sortProperties=+product.marketingPriority,-product.startDate&navCount=45&navAction=poppushpush&color=&pushId=W_APP_DRESSES&popId=WOMENS_APPAREL&prepushId=" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...</a><br>  <br>  it would also hide whatever you are self conscious of. <br>  <br>  you could pair this with a cute cream white cardigan and if you want, some black tights and ankle boots.<br>  <br>  the result would be kind of rocker chic.<br>  <br>  make sure to go to the concert and have fun! :)|`|6yXe3wvraa	wear  some colored skinneys with a white v neck or any white t with a leather jacket n converse of flats or heels i recomend heels im a heels person|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	wear black. <br>  or try something like this<br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6UzdmF8O-Oo/SY16C4NS3tI/AAAAAAAANm0/nOuPsAz-t4s/s1600-h/IMG_5185.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6UzdmF8O-Oo/SY...</a><br>  but it sounds like you're not confident so i dunno if that outfit would work on you .<br>   just go jeans and a t . an interesting necklace.|`|AA11915664	OMG! girl, go and have fun. go for comfort b/c concerts are so much fun. jeans and tshirt or go a little emo or even dress up a bit. its all fair game.<br>  you only get one go at this life so own who you are. i'm kind of "fluffy" myself so i speak from experience. please don't let the good times pass you by. go out there and ROCK!
U2x39JPyaa	you need to be 18 to work as an in store model<br>  and for the fragrence you should try looking on ebay they'll probably ship it to you|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	I'd think you'd probably have to be 18 or maybe 21 and older. And since you don't have and there, you'd probably have to move to the United States..
5nmFtzgqaa	I think that's SO GOOD for the amount you got!<br>  Especially from those places.<br>  ESPECIALLY when there are jeans included.<br>  I mean, to be honest, you could get cheaper else where<br>  but good job at finding the bargains at American Eagle and Hollister.<br>  Usually a pair of jeans is close to 60-80 and a cardigan, about the same.<br>  Most tank tops there average on about 20 each and a pair of shorts can be 40.<br>  With the hoodie added, which would be about 60-70, <br>  I would say you could've ended up with a 200-some purchase.|`|b3FkhOicaa	That's about $21.16 per item, which to me sounds like a lot, but maybe you don't think so.  I usually shop on clearance at AE and Hollister, where I can get the same things for a lot cheaper.  But, AE and Hollister are moderatley expensive stores, so $21/16 isn't that surprising.|`|GcgrFMuNaa	That's a rip-off. If you gave me $127, I could give you<br>  an entirely new wardrobe.|`|c9a3d9dca5392c96cefc139c2c2ceaddaa	If thats the style you want to dress in you're gonna end up paying like that.  Alex up there is totally right, $127 is cheap, if I were shopping (I'm a guy) and I got jeans, shorts, a hoodie, a cardigan (I'd never wear that lol) and two tee's I'd spend like..<br>  <br>  $50~60 jeans<br>  $30 cargo shorts or even athletic shorts<br>  $40 hoodie<br>  $50 sweater<br>  and about 30 bucks for 2 shirts so I'd be around $210.<br>  <br>  But seeing as you're 14 you don't really need to dress up to that extent..|`|vFCxdraNaa	Personally I think that American Eagle and Hollister are extremely over-rated but since your only 14 you are heavily influenced by other girls. Were any of the items on sale? I definately know in the men's section at Hollister they have a supberb sale rack you might want to try the sale rack before paying full price!|`|hg5I1O2xaa	YES! <br>  <br>  AE and Hollister are expensive to begin with! Personally, I just think that's unreasonable. You could go to other stores and get the same thing for $50 or more less.<br>  <br>  Personal opinion. I don't mean to offend.|`|wfnQNIhCaa	its pretty good actually....are you getting a pair of each from both stores or just one?|`|zbqL749iaa	Well, for those stores that's a pretty good price considering the prices at those stores.<br>  <br>  But I think you could probably find more clothes, for a better price at other cool stores too. (:|`|xxGEnylfaa	you should share it|`|GnT2CnhBaa	(im australian) but jeez!. if i could get that much clothing here for $127 id be in heaven lol.

ZZJKTV8laa	it was prolly just the brand. or it does sound like you could have that astigmitism or whatever that makes your contacts move around a lot. color wise i think the brown ones are the only ones that look real.|`|gXrwqoTGaa	Well did your doctor fit you for them or did you just buy them without going to an optometrist first?<br>  <br>  I know many people who have prescription color contacts and it does not move around. Tell your doctor if you have been fitted. She probably may fit you again or maybe it's something else with your eye that has to be fixed.<br>  <br>  Color wise, every color looks real if it fits your face. Meaning if you are a very dark girl don't get blue or honey. My cousin has gray contacts which fits her face and I know two other people with gray and brown contacts that fits their face.

rtSmUZNuaa	Biotin really worked for me. My hair is naturally curly, so of course I want to straighten it as much as possible, but all that heat on my hair fried it to the point it was like straw. So I cut all the dead hair off and started taking Biotin.

It just makes you get a nasty build up over time.<br>  <br>  Hair is again, dead, so taking a vitamin and having good lifestyle habits is the best way to help out damaged hair.  Just don't expect this to help your existing hair, it would just allow your new hair to grow in more healthy.|`|d9am6wDqaa	Hi, use pure apricot oil before going to bed daily.

Small joke from the past. Fast forward a little more.Then there were vidieo games. Kind of fun at first, until a whole generation of gamers quit showing up to work, ignored their own persolal hygene, their familys, their health, etc. Get the picture. Worse than any drug addiction that ever came across the pike.But my favorite highly technological device was dental floss. I never used it, never had a cavity. Then my dentist said you need to try this stuff. so I did. The next year, 6 cavitys !! I said to him what the heck? He said you need to use the dental floss more. Another year goes by, again the same thing. 6 more cavities. So I said Doc what's up with this ? So he said not using the dental floss enough. So now I'm dental flossing 3 times a day. Another year goes by. Now I go to the dentist. He says "PROBLEM SOLVED". I say really !! He says yes. We need to take all your teeth out, you have 96 cavitys. You'll never have the problem again.

You can try over the counter medications and natural medications, but if your pimples are very deep, they will leave scarring if you don't get a perscription medication.  I know because I have scars from when I was a teenager.  I took my son to a dermatologist so he wouldn't go through the painful time I had in my college days because of my scars.  He put my son on Accutane and within 3 days, his skin cleared.  It was a big hassle to get on Accutane and you have to have blood drawn monthly to make sure your kidneys aren't affected, but it is definately worth the trouble. The only reason it is such a hassle to get on is because there were some cases of a people who committed suicide while taking Accutane in conjuction with some anti-depressant medications.  My son is on Zoloft and it did not affect him at all.  If anything, it made him feel better because he looked better.  But, it is a decision for you and your parents to look into and see if you feel Accutane is best for you.  If that is too much trouble, the dermatologist can also prescribe some other type of medication or put you on antibiotics that can help.  All of the other ideas are great, but if you are serious about preventing scarring (if you have the larger pimples), I would try and get to a dermatologist.  Good luck.

QsVMeaPXaa	none of them really work and you spend a lot of money and Thermage is painful.<br>  <br>  Came back to offer you more info.<br>  Accent? and Thermage? both claim to recontour the face and body by reducing fat and tightening the skin in the process. They both use radiofrequency technology but in different ways. Many of the websites display the manufacturer-supplied before and after images and I suggest you ask the clinic for photos of their own patients to see how successful they are! Accent? is often performed by a fully trained aesthetic nurse, and a treatment course usually consists of between 4-6 treatments whereas Thermage? is usually performed by a doctor and is performed over 1-2 treatments. Many cosmetic doctors are starting to favour the Accent? machine due to its lower costs, pain-free treatments and better results. However, results with both technologies are still inconsistent.<br>  <br>  The Ultrasound and Infra-red products offer similar inconsistencies and are potentially less likely to work compared with the radiofrequency models. However, if you have found a clinic who does achieve good, reliable results with their technology, and have happy clients to show to you, then go with them.
