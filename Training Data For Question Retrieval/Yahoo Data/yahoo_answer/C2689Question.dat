I heard somewhere that cat's shouldn't drink milk because it could be dangerous for them, I don't have a cat or anything, I was just curious though. Because it didn't make sense to me, because when cats are kittens they drink milk from their mother, please answer? Thank you!

20090223161314AAoEA7o	Pets;Dogs	9 yr old non-spayed Cocker, trained by me. He lived away for 6 yrs. Has doggie door,but pees in house at night?	I have a Cocker Spaniel that is incredibly smart, loyal and obedient. After 6 yrs w/ my mom, (i'm in the Navy) i've acquired him. Instead of using the doggie door freely, he chooses to urinate in certain locations around the house while I sleep. After having him back for 3 mos, I got a male puppy. I didn't think it an issue, as he had the company of 2 dogs (M;F) when he was w/ my mom. He's been placed outside during the daytime bc he would urinate around the house, while I was at work. He is walked, fed well and given equal attention as the puppy. The puppy is constantly on his heels; never lets up. How do I prevent his urinating around the house?
20090223163140AAn1E73	Pets;Cats	I'm going to start charging by the minute---?	Hello friends and cat lovers:      This morning I asked a question as to whether or not I have a bobcat in my backyard and I was fearful that he may have hurt one of the strays I've been feeding....well that theory is completly eliminated.      I came home from work to find all three (and after seeing him in broad daylight, the "bobcat" is actually just one eff'd up looking cat).  They all were rolling around on the ground/pressing themselves against each other and PEEING ON MY GRILL!!  No lie, all three were taking turns.      Then while I was trying to eat dinner, I look outside and see a male cat sitting quietly, staring RIGHT at the grill, as if he's answering their calls (b/c last night, what I thought was screaming from the cats, thinking the bobcat is eating them, was actually a mating call by all three females).  Another reason why I know this cat is male is because MY CAT Larry was going crazy, and he doesn't notice the other three females.      Help, I don't know what to do b/c I knoe they are all going to have a jolly old time tonight and probably get preggo and I don't know what to do for them..what happens if they have babies?  They will just keep producing kittens until they die.      I can try and call the Helen Kraus foundation, but what if we have to catch them ourselves?  THe humane soicety will neuter them, but they will also keep them and then euthanize...where as the H.K.Foundation will spay/neuter and then release them (that's how we got Larry).      My husband just went outside and hosed down the grill and grill cover w/bleach...he said the smells are horrific.  I think it was pointless, b/c they are just going to pee on it again.      As I am typing this, I hear the "cat calling"...it's only 7:30 and it's already starting!!

A LOT.. and we have a puppy pad in there just in case but he still goes.. i do what people have told me to do in the past which is take away the food and only leave a couple ice cubes for him so he doesn't get dehydrated.. i usually take his food away around 830/9.. take him out 10-15mins after that and then right before we lay down  and when we are expected to be gone for more then an hour we do the same thing.. is this normal for puppies and will he eventually be able to hold it.. i know he's not going to be potty trained completely with the snap of my finger and it takes time and patients(so dont leave any rude comments about that).. but just wondering if he'll eventually quit going when he's put up over night or longer then 1hr or 2

Guppies out numbered the rest of the fish by quite a few.

Every couple days for the last week I've been finding dead medium to full size guppies with their tail completely missing. I originally thought it was my filter so I covered it so not fish would be injured; however; it keeps happening. How do I find out which fish are causing the damage? Do you think it's just one?

She has a hoarse cough and occasionally will cough up a clear mucus.        Other than that she seems fine.  Shes still very active and eats and drinks no problems, but the cough kind of worries me.  So how long should a dog cold last before I get too worried?        She has only had it two days so far from what I can tell.  So should I wait a few more days and watch her?  And if the cough keeps up im definitely going to get her a veterinary appointment.      I was reading around that as long as her mucus is clear colored and not of the green/golden color I shouldn't worry a lot.

With the economy the way it is, I've seen a LOT of horses being given up for almost nothing.  The latest advertisement for winning, Thoroughbred mares in foal for $175.  Crazy.      Of course, I know the cost of the animal is the least expense to worry about.  So, just how much does it cost to keep a horse?  One rider told me that for her, it was a "car payment".  What do you think?      Can you give me an average and likely monthly or yearly cost of keeping a healthy horse?  A horse with common ailments?  Can you list costs?

20090222143506AAVGuNr	Pets;Horses	Looking at an equine vet as a career, I have a few questions though?	Thanks in advance for reading this, I REALLY appreciate it!         1) I know that there's a lot of years of university and vet school that I'll have to go through and that the schooling itself will cost ALOT. Any comments on how long it will take before I'm able to break even on money again?      2) What are the pros and cons of working privately and being your own boss as opposed to working under someone else as one of their employee vets?      3) I know the hours as a vet of any type can be kind of odd with emergency's, being on call, etc.    Would I be constantly working all the time? Would my days just be longer then regular work days? Holidays?   Can someone just comment on what the timetable and hours as a vet would be like.      4) Do you need lots of strong math or english to be an equine vet? I know you need strong science, biology, and physics to be a vet.         Thanks so, so, SO much! I've always wanted to be an equine vet but now I'm wondering whether I'd be working all the time and have no time to enjoy myself outside of work.

20090222151506AAqLmTc	Pets;Reptiles	What type of snake should I get?	I want to get a bigger snake then the ones I have now. But I just can't decide on what snake would be best for me(just because I love them all)      About me:   I currently own (all full grown adults) 6 ball pythons, 6 red tail boas, 1 corn snake, 1 king snake. And I love them all dearly!   *Now before you jump to conclusion, all my snakes are kept in different tanks, each one get their own tanks/cage. I have 2 snake rooms, one room for the cages/tanks and one for the soon-to-be larger snake(it's not going to have a tank, but it's own glass room).      I don't know which snake would be best for me(truthfully, I want them all(lol), and I want to hear your opinions/experiences. I was thinking a burmese or retic. I do realize that feeding them will be a handful but it's not a problem for me, my friend is a rat breeder so I'll always have food for the sweethearts.      Do you have any suggestions? What are your experience with the larger snakes? Which snake do you think would be best?      Thanks in advance. (I will pick best answer)      *Please no rude/mean comment, I will report you.
20090222140150AAwcVDe	Pets;Birds	Breeds of my hens???	I got my chickens last week but didn't ask the farmer about the breed as he dropped them at my dads, i have two hens and a cockerel.   Im wondering what breeds they are and if we need there wings clipped as we want to let them around the garden. There are fences around one metre high. The cockerel seems quite quiet and friendly. Also with the huth there is a hook to shut the hen house door. Should i lock them all in at night for safety. They have a mesh coop and most fences are sealed off. Do they need to feed on grit too? We have laying pellets so would the cockerel need somethin different as he eats it anyway? i also wondered if your chickens liked grapes as mine loved them? and any other ideads on treats are welcome. As the cockerel is quite friendly where should i stroke him as he doesn't seem to react to anythin lol. The hens (and cockerel) only use the hen house at late night, is this normal? also the cokerel doesn't call out, Is he too young? is there any bedding we should use in the house, we have two nesting boxes and a perch in the hen house. there is saw-dust on the boxes and a bit on the floor. in the small run there is soil and pebbles and we scatter the food on the floor so they forrage (dont know if i spelt that right lol). Also should we get some grit for them? and do we put it seperate or with the food on the floor? We want eggs off them so would we have to remove them immediately so we dont have chicks? and how would you get chicks ? thanks for all the info in advance    : )     sorry its so long. i just want the best for my chickens lol.         here is the cockerel;       http://s460.photobucket.com/albums/qq322...        http://s460.photobucket.com/albums/qq322...       here are the hens;          http://s460.photobucket.com/albums/qq322...        http://s460.photobucket.com/albums/qq322...          and all of them;       http://s460.photobucket.com/albums/qq322...       here is the coop;       http://s460.photobucket.com/albums/qq322...       also one of the hens cough/sneezes so should i be worried about any illnsesses? and are all eggs safe to eat? should i have their wings clipped (i dont know there breed)      thanks again x

20090222143111AADRrlR	Pets;Dogs	I have a older German shepard mixed, 7 yr old fox terrier, a rat chow puppy and a 3 month old chocolate lab?	The 3 dogs are not the problem. When my son brought home the new dog,  a 3 month old chocolate lab(Missy) very cute, but the breeders allowed her to chase bunny's. Now I hope you can see what the problem is.  The rat-chow (and I know I am spelling it wrong but bear with me please) looked just like a white rabbit. When my little dog (witch is a therapeutically dog for my daughter who has seizure's)  finally barked at Missy she seemed to realize that she was not a bunny but a dog. Things started to get better, my son and his dog live in the barn out back which there is not a lot of room so when she comes in the house it is like a massive play ground all the toys and bones any dog could ever want. Well the problem we are having she mounts and mouths the little dog. We were watching all of the dogs last night(grandma and grandpa and 4 dogs 2 of which are puppies) and Missy (the chocolate lab) hurt the little one. I need ideals for help on how to stop Missy from trying to dominate the little one. She knows better with the fox terrier and the german shepard but she just wont let the little one be.  Is there anything I can do? I know the easy answerer would be to tell my son get rid of her but he needs her I know that sounds crazy but he really does. We do really like the dog (as we are dog people the german shepard is a rescue dog very close to death when we took her in nursed her to health now healthy and happy and a bit chubby)  but back to my problem what is the chocolate lab doing and how can I stop her from mounting and mouthing my little dog? Is there a way to stop her from doing that? If we can get her to stop we would have the perfect dog family. Can anyone help?

20090222143455AALMsF1	Pets;Cats	How can I fix my old cat's depression?	My older cat, who's almost 1 year old, went through a stark change once the new cat showed up.  They never really hissed at each other and seem to play and groom, but I've noticed the older cat getting more and more withdrawn.  He doesn't sit in my lap anymore and just avoids everyone.  I finally got the younger cat neutered, so he's been in my room all week, and now the old cat is back to his friendly self, constantly purring and wanting attention with the baby out of the picture.      What can I do?  I was thinking that maybe it was because the younger cat wasn't neutered.  If that's the case, can I expect things to change when I reintroduce him?
20090222143740AA9oUBu	Pets;Dogs	How to potty train a little dog?	PLEASE HELP...I am desperate. I have had my lhasa poo (he only weighs 8 pounds) for over 2 months now and he is STILL not potty trained.  I have tried buying an expensive book that said to put him on a schedule that he will get used to (didnt work).  I have tried puppy training pads, he chews them and runs around the house.  I have tried putting a bell at the door so that he associates that with going to the bathroom, doesnt work. I take him potty as soon as he gets up, after breakfast, before I go to to work, when I get home from work, after dinner, and he never has more than an hour between times that we go out..and he still goes!  He doesnt give a sniffing warning either.  Please give me any suggestions, I dont know how much longer I can stand this.  He wont go to the bathroom in his crate, but he will go if he is in a room with us, which shows me that he can hold it...but chooses not to. HELP!  Anyone had experience with this?

I don't need one powerful enough to tame a large dog or anything but i like to let my rabbit out of her cage while i'm home and let her jump around the room. The only problem is that she likes to go to 2 different places and scratch @ the wall/rug over and over again. I've tried to shout/scare her when she does it in hopes she'd learn but there doesn't seem to be any signs of progress. i was hoping that there might b some sort of light weight and minimal force electric collar for her. it's my hope that maybe after a week or 2 of getting a slight jolt she'd begin to understand that clawing @ the rug = bad.

20090222153534AA5pO95	Pets;Dogs	Ever since my dog got neutered, a couple weeks ago, he's hungry all the time. Is they why or could it be some-?	thing else?    He isn't lazy. He's actually still very energetic, maybe more since he got neutered a couple weeks ago but am wondering why he's so hungry all tht time. He wants more and more food even after he's eaten. I have given him more food and he hasn't gained any weight but he wants more food.
20090222155323AA2GwS2	Pets;Dogs	How do you find out if your dog has worms? And what really are worms where would they be?	There are a couple things going on with my dog. And both point to him having worms, according to what I've read and according to some answers people have been giving here. I know the Vet can find out, but how does he/she find out if my dog has worms?  And what exactly is that?    Signs:   right now my dog is enthusiastically ripping open an empty pizza box trying to get to food. YET, he's eaten his 1 cup of food plus another 1/2 cup of food over his daily requirement.  And he also has started eating dog poo on our walks. Both point to maybe him having worms. So I've read on the Internet. (he was at the Vet's 2 weeks ago, getting neutered and someone said he could have picked worms up there)

20090222153934AAIBsLF	Pets;Fish	Help with my treatment of Ick?	I noticed late one evening about 4 days ago my fish had Ick. The very next day I went and purchased API: Super Ick Cure. I applied half the doses to my 55 gallon tank as read in the directions. 48 hours later I applied the 2nd and final doses. After the first dose I turned the water temp up to 82 degrees as instructed to help speed up the parasites life cycle. Unfortunately I had to turn the temp back down to 76 degrees because my fish were suffocating from the high temp. I also turned off my aquarium light because I read that the lights can break down the medicine in the water.The instruction say to wait another 48 hours and then replace 25% of the water in the tank.      I had cichlids in the tank about a month ago. I gave them to a friend so that I could start a community tank. A month before giving them away a few of the fish had Ick. I treated them with the same medicine, and they bounced right back. After giving the fish away, we emptied the tank in order to move it into another room. After emptying it we cycled new water for a few days, and then introduced the community fish.       What my main concern is here, is that the Ick was still in the rocks. So I was wondering if I'd be advised that I empty the tank once more after the treatment, clean the rocks and tank with very hot water, fill the tank and cycle the water again, then re-introduce the fish back into the tank.      Also, I was wondering how long it might take for my community fish to bouce back. The cichlids before were very normal right after the treatment, but they also seem much more durable and tough than mollies and platy's.      I am still very new to having fish, so any advice can help. I have done my research on Ick so I know about how the fish contract the parasite, and what conditions cause the parasite to live in your tank. So no need for lectures on that, I figured that would save some people time when they answer this question.

20090222154255AA3jj3o	Pets;Dogs	Puppy with diarrhea!? what dog food is good?	So, my 4 1/2 month old lab has had diarrhea on and off since January.  I took him to the vet immediately and she ran tests to rule out parvo, worms, and parasites.  All of the tests came back clean.  I had gradually switched his dog food from Nutro Puppy to Purina One Puppy food.  After all the tests came back negative we treated him for parasites and worms, as soon as I stoped giving him the medicine the diarrhea came back.  The lead to another vet trip where she ruled out worms and parasites again.  We put him on Hills I/D food and it worked like a charm.  HOWEVER I know this is very bad food for puppies and I am trying to find out what food would be bland enough for his sensitive stomach.  I am trying to put him back on Nutro but I'm seeing that it is upseting his stomach again.  What should I do?  I cannot afford to feed him the hills as it costs $30 for only 10 lbs....        I really have no idea what ingredient could be causing the upset.  Oh, he has had all of his shots and rabies.  Acts healthy.  Shiny coat.  He just has explosive diarrhea on certain foods.  Any suggestions for a bland diet?

I'm wondering if this amount of social time with us is enough for her, or if during the day she is really lonely.      We have a cat also, and have tried to get them to be friends.  The cat watches the rabbit a lot through the little fence, but they don't really interact aside from this.

20090222142142AALmTMn	Pets;Dogs	Can owners be held legally responsible for abandoning a pet?	So the dog I fund is chipped. The vet called the shelter where they admitted that the whole adoption was "shady". They let the dog go with this person who managed not to pay any fees for him. Then this person dumped him in the Las Vegas Desert. When the vet called him he never called back. Can this person be sued? What does the law say about leaving an animal to die? Should the vet (who did not disclose the owners name to me) report this person to the police? I don't want this idiot to get the dog back, but I want this person to pay for what he has done!
20090222130923AAzDeo4	Pets;Reptiles	How can i improve my bearded dragons diet?	I can not give him crickets daily, my mom says they are to much of a hassle, so I try to make sure we go to petsmart and he gets crickets at least twice a week. I gets a salad of mustard greens, sometimes kale and carrots, or strawberries and other veggies. Romain as a treat, he really loves it! And also once a day he gets super worms. My mom says she talked to a lady who breeds them and she says they don't need meat every day and salad is ok, but meat is good. I was wondering, what can I do to make his diet better, i know it is not ideal. I always dust his food with the vitamin dust and also, what are some really nutritious greens and other fruits/veggies he can eat?

20090222130151AAHlf7Y	Pets;Birds	Will by budgie ever really like me?	We just got a beautiful little budgie and I was surprised at how mean he/she is. It bites really hard and really does not want anything to do with me. lol   I read about them on the internet and learned not to actually hold them  but let them perch and they use their mouth to move around and climb so I got the hang of it now and he/she does not bite as much but still really does not want any contact with me either way.      If I just keep putting my hand it there and letting it perch will it get used to me or am I going to make it hate me? Can I make it like me by constantly showing it that I will not hurt it or are they the type of bird to just sit there and not want to be bothered. Should I be training my bird or what? I know I know--I should do more research next time. lol   But any budgie owners out there that want to share some advice or tips would be great.   Thanks in advance guys.

Could it be because I had to feed her 2 cups before and now it's only one and her mind thinks she is still hungry. Or is it she loves this new food so much that she simply wants more of it?

20090222131112AAoT7pV	Pets;Dogs	Dog cruelty/adoption?	I will be reporting a relative's neighbor for dog cruelty this week.  I found the shaved dog outside (it's winter in Ohio), limping, shivering, with ice on its coat.  When the neighbor came to the door, he called the dog stubborn and said when his wife got home she could get the dog inside.  He said this even after I told him the dog was shivering and covered in ice.  It was only after my relative asked if she could pick the dog up and carry her to the door did the owner let the dog back inside.      Also, my relatives and other neighbors report that this dog is constantly loose and almost getting hit by cars.      Last summer, when I lived with this relative, the dog was chained up outside all day without adequate food or water...and would bark all day.      The license is also 6 years old. To my knowledge, they have to be renewed every year in Ohio.      Initially I was hesitant to report it, out of fear for my relative's safety, but the sight of this poor dog freezing was too much.  Judging from the man's reaction, it is my belief that the wife probably cares for the dog, but the man treats it like junk.      Regardless, I'm reporting it.      My question is this: Would it seem weird to request to be notified if the couple lost custody of the dog, as I would like to adopt it?      Thanks.
20090222131224AAELUGC	Pets;Dogs	I wish my dog would like my daughter?	I have a small poodle, who is very attached to me, he's an incredibly sweet dog and he likes all people.  I also have a young daughter who loves him dearly, she has some health problems and is sick quite often.  She spends a lot of her time in bed and she desperately    wants our dog to be with her, but whenever he goes in her room with her, after a few minutes he jumps off the bed and starts scratching at the door so he can come out and see me.  And whenever my daughter and I sit together on the couch he comes over to me.  He's a good dog and means no harm, but I really wish he would attach to her more, she gets very upset when he does this and I don't know what to do.  He likes her fine and she's good with him but he just hasn't bonded with her the way she would like him to.      Please help me,      Thank you

20090222132006AAUtpHD	Pets;Dogs	Help! My puppy woke up from a nap and was very aggressive and afraid!?	I have a 13 week old cockapoo puppy who woke up from a nap late last night and totally panicked.  I was standing about 6 feet away from him when he woke up with a start, and ran to the corner of our bedroom alternating between blood curtailing screams and growls directed at me.  He also smeared a bit of poop over the pillows as he ran.   It took him about 20 seconds to calm down, and then it was like a light went on in his head.   He abruptly stopped screaming, and came running towards me shaking.  He then hid under my legs for about 10 minutes.  I tried to go to sleep about half an hour later, but he refused to lie down.  It was as if he was on guard.  We were up for at least 3 hours trying to get him to relax.  Before last night we had never had a problem with him going to sleep.      He is the sweetest puppy normally, but last night I was truly afraid he was going to bite me.  This happened once before, but to a much lesser extent.  He woke up from a nap and screamed, but it only took a few seconds for him to calm down and come cuddle me.  I donâ€™t normally have a problem waking him up from naps.  I call his name and he opens his eyes, tail wagging, and wants to snuggle.  I have only used positive reinforcement to train him, and he is very cuddly with me normally, so I know he isnâ€™t actually afraid of me.  It seems like he forgets who I am...         Has anyone had any experience with this type of behaviour?  Is it possible he is just having really bad dreams and he will grow out of it?  I am at a total loss as to what my next step should be and could really use some advice!   Thanks so much, BP

Just today when I was at the pet store buying him some crickets A lady came in with a tiny frail baby leopard gecko and was trying to give "her" up. (Im not sure if its a girl or boy) so I decided to take Lelu home. She and Lud are getting along great however this frail baby only ate one cricket. She hadn't had anything to eat for a few days prior to today's cricket. And she is quite jumpy. Lud has jumped out of my hands a few times and is relatively slow compared to Lelu who jumps constantly. I haven't seen her walk more than a step in my hand (which are warm) she will walk in the tank but as soon as she comes into contact with my hands she starts jumping. Now this is the first day I have had her is she so jumpy because this is a new situation for her? Ludlow has been handled on a regular basis and is perfectly content with me handling him. Also Lelu will sit perfectly still if I cup my hands around her and just hold her. Could she be ridiculously cold? She has like nothing on her bones but skin basically. Is there anything I can feed her other than crickets to fatten her up? She wont eat meal worms. And my pet store wont sell wax worms individually.

He's a 10 month old colt, so I know its gonna be really long.  We are planning to keep him a stud.  He is exactly what a mini should be.  little, well conformed, and really sweet.  Also, he still has the "foal hair" which is harder to brush, so it'll definitely be harder to brush it constantly.  We are going to clip and bathe him come spring time, so we will shampoo and conditioner his tail and mane and stuff.

I noticed a couple of days ago that there were some old shrimp pellets in my filter, so I did a 25% water change yesterday, and cleaned the shrimp pellets out of the filter. The tank seemed to get even MORE cloudy! This is not a new tank - it has been established for almost 2 years now. I did a water test, and it came out fine. There was no ammonia, nitrite and 40ppm of nitrate. (For some reason the nitrate isn't going away, even though I do water changes every week or so...)      My tank IS a little overstocked, but not by much. I only have guppies, platies, mollies, a swordtail, some corys and a couple baby fish, but I honestly don't know why it's cloudy. I've always had this much fish!      Please help me!   I will choose best answer and any other answers will be appreciated!   Thanks!

20090222142909AAR7ZCx	Pets;Other - Pets	Could you possibly give me some tips for starting a rabbitry?	I already know what breed I'll do, and what the dangers of breeding are. I would limit the # of litters a doe could have, and limit my herd to under 15 rabbits. Do any of you rabbit enthusiasts/breeders/showers have any tips for me?
20090222143648AANJjOW	Pets;Dogs	How can I train my dog?	I have a collie.  People think of Lassie, but don't.  THe main problem is pulling on his walks.  I have tryed choker collars, gentle leads, and harnesses, but he still pulls.  I am trying to teach him how to heel, i have done research online, but nothing works.  I have tried changing direction when he pulls, and walking in circles.  Nothing works.  I am also trying to teach my dog how to sit, but he won't unless I have food for him that he really wants.  So I know he can, and that he knows what I'm trying to get him to do, but he's so stubborn he won't do it.  Please help me, thank you.

20090222142329AAhO9H2	Pets;Dogs	Puppies and use of shock collar/electric fence.?	I have a 3 year old pit bull who has used electric fence/shock system for two years. When she had a litter of pups I decided to keep one and wonder when it would be safe to use the collar on the puppy as well. For now he stays with Sassy when out in the yard but it was something I was wondering. I have heard 3 months, 6months, 12 months etc.... The one I use will beep before it shocks to warn the dogs. Granted, he will be shocked a few times til he figures it out but when would it be safe. Also, I think with the other dogs being ont he shock, maybe they would help the puppy learn boundaries as well. Yes shock is sometimes cruel but I use it for the yard only when they are outside and for the fact that I raise Pit Bulls. My dogs have never bitten anyone so don't go there about violent dogs. It's how they are raised, loved, treated, and respected. Mine are very loved but I have to look out for their safety as well since getting a normal fence is not an option. Thanks ahead of time to those that answer without being rude.

20090222143849AApmSg3	Pets;Cats	My kitty has ringworms, how do i prevent her from spreading it, but still treat her as directed by my vet?	i'm using a topical prescrition, and amoxicillin & griesolution oral prescriptions. Check Up at the vet tomorrow, but i'm worried about lysol not being enough to kill all of the spores in my carpet and bedding and whatnot. I also have a 6-7 month old jack russel/maltese puppy. If you've ever dealt with this situation, did you end up getting the fungi & what did you do, or did you prevent the spread, and for god's sake how?
