20090205124840AASAqMj	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I can't wait to get out of high school and move onto college.?	I am a senior in high school and I have a couple of months left. The first three years of high school were very good for me, I had many friends and people to talk to. Now I started to realize that I hate this school and that the "friends" I made are not real friends. I just understood that, some of them are really boring and backstabbed me in the past. I understood the reality and now I decided not to associate myself with anyone at my school. But in reality Im a very social person but not at high school because I was very disappointed in the way I acted in the first 3 years of high school. I use to be very immature, rude and uncanny when I think about it. Now I just want to move on with my life and just go to class and come out. But sometimes I feel very bad because I don't talk to anyone and I show little emotion in some of my classes(not all I actually do laugh and smile). But I actually do love talking with my cousins and relatives, but like i said I really don't like my school anymore. I am a social person but I just despise my past memories in high school that I can't even talk to anyone there only a few people. I really want to go to college so that I could socialize there and not be bothered by my horrid high school past. Any advice? Thanks.

Me and my friends have been kind of making a little trouble lately- NOT a lot... but there have been a couple instances where we have been in trouble.   1. We skipped gym class to call my friend who's in the hospital   2. We skipped lunch duty ONE day because there were no rags left      and today me and one of my friends were watching the play rehearsal and we wanted to get something to drink, so we headed to the snack bar.    We figured it was fine to go since it was open and it was last period. So we got our stuff and started to go back to play practice when my EVIL homeroom teacher came down the hall.    She hates us for some unknown reason, probably though because we talk so much in her class. oh well. so we ducked into the bathroom and she came in and started yelling at us! she was being really intense, like "WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR PLACE IS IN THIS SCHOOL? DO YOU THINK YOU ARE HIGHER THAN THE RULES?" it was so weird and awkward... then she told us she was going to bring it to our principals attention.   what should i do?   thank you for answering and i will pick best answer!!

20090205135533AAN3iRK	Education & Reference;Teaching	What do I do about a teacher harassing me?	Okay so my English teacher is always picking on me and I never done anything to her. I think it's because of my race and my shyness that she takes advantage of. Because she would let the (not trying to be racist here but using examples) black students talk as loud and as long as they want and she won't even say anything. But when I talk to my friend for no longer than 5 seconds, I get yelled at. And no one can even hear me except for my friend and one classmate asked me why the teacher yelled at me because she didn't hear me say anything. So that's one proof that I don't talk as loud as the black students.       And okay, so, she let one of the black girls call her ugly and she didn't get mad but when I tell MY FRIEND (not my teacher) to stick up the finger (not the finger you're thinking about), the finger she stuck up to another student and she said she's going to report it to the guidance office.... ? Wth is that. She doesn't even know what I'm talking about and she thought I was talking about the middle finger.       Okay, and there's another time where I didn't complete my homework because I was confused by it. But she claims that I was being "LAZY" and just ignored me. So I spoked to my biology teacher about this and she said that I'm not lazy and don't let her get to me.       Idk, what to do because it seems like everyone likes this teacher except for me because they think that a RUDE teacher is considered "cool." I want to report her for what she's doing but then I'm scared that everyone would get mad at me if she gets fired or something.        This teacher is completely rude and she doesn't even act her own age. She would make up rules like "Don't say shut up" , "Don't say gey", "Don't be mean to other students" , "Respect what others have to say". Okay, so she says shut up and doesn't respect me. Um.... seems like she doesn't even follow her own rules....

We got report cards today, and I was happy with all of my A's, but then for prealgebra I got a C+. Prealgebra isn't my best subjuect, or math in general, but I've always managed to get A's in it, except for two other years when I got B+'s, so it's rare that I don't get a good mark.      I know my parents are going to kill me, because they got really mad when I got a B+ in math one year with all f the rest of my grades being A's. They punished me and took away phone and computer- this was last year. Basically, anything that isn't perfect A's is bad to them, so just imagine a C+! I feel so pressured all of the time, and now I guess I finally broke.      I'm not even sure why I got a C+ now that I think about it- The only bad grade I got was a 48 on this really hard quiz ( the highest grade in the class was a 70), but it was just a quiz, and all the rest of my tests and quizzes were 90's and 100's. plus, I got the 48 at the beginning on the semester, and that was before progress reports came out, and I got an 83 on my progress report, but I didn't get a bad grade since them, so I really don't know what happened.      What should I do?

Now i went to get help and i got it, but i ended up being called a loser and a snitch (to which i might as well add people were saying that im gonna get jumped, im gonna die and that i am a retard). And just to make me look more loser, they added to that that i was racist. (Now i can swear that ive never even thaught about getting into the race, because myself, im strong against racism) The thing is, ive been a target of bullying 4 a long time, and im really sick of it. I dont wanna change schools or anything, because ive done that already 5 times in my whole life (Im 14). Now, some people told me that "ill see tommorow". What should i do? Should i go get help?

At many points in her life, she wanted to become president of the US and she can list all of the presidents in order in just 2 minutes!  She is very intrigued in the Holocaust.  She knows more about it than some of her teachers do!  She is also the greatest musician I know.  She plays lots of the instruments, but is especially good at the trumpet.

She also loves to act and was in high school productions at the age of 10!  So of this information, what college should she go to and what field should she be in?

I don't like people thinking that I am a professional (perpetual) student.       I used to be soooo consistent in what I wanted to study, but after a few years, I was not so sure.      So, after two years of majoring in my passion, I switched (due to my parents entreaties) to something more practical, and, having come into some money recently, I will return to school to finish my passion degree. Total: 8 years as an undergrad.       I will then pursue a doctorate (PhD) in my passion. Four years.       Total 12 years as a student.       I did not want to switch to something practical, but I felt that I had to or I'd be a loser.       I don't like people thinking I'm a professional student either; in fact, I derided professional students back when I was consistent about my studies. I guess that's Karma for you.       How Can I Rid Others Of The Perception That I Am A "Professional Student"?

Dear Mr. Jake Burton,        According to the latest newspaper, throughout the United States you are holding interviews for additions to your Burton snowboarding team. Without lessons, people will be falling upon their backside, which involves lots of pain and bruising. In spite of these interviews, I also read that there will be competitions against the people who succeed in the interviews. But the people who pass will be whom? Beyond the newspaper, there are many details that should have been published. Because of this lack of information, people who have a real passion will search for the information themselves on the internet. My friend looked up the details for me. We told our friends about it. They were interested in the details, therefore we told them the details. I am looking forward being interviewed by you and I hope you are looking forward to an interview with me. Instead of not being passionate, I researched the details therefore you will see me coming to the  Flagship Store in Burlington, Vermont, waiting in line to be interviewed.      Thank you for your time!   Sincerely,    ____________(name)

20090205140554AAlqbjU	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Problem with Life and Jobs - help?	So I think im experiencing the worst point in my life and im only 21.   Im a medical student and im work hard and medicine has always been a passion.   But with one of my teachers I didnt get along with - for some reason she hated me and used to pick on me. I had her for the oral exam and even though I knew everything she failed my enough times to get me kicked out saying I wasnt the sort of person that had what it takes.      The irony - i passed all my other subjects and this was the the only one i had left while the rest of my class have atleast 2 or 3 more exams to take.      I spoke to the Dean but he said there is nothing more he could do. So im officially - as of today - not a student anymore and I dont think anything could hurt as much as this.      So as if my day could not get worse - my parents kind of said they want to step away from me and thats the nice way of saying I disown you.      Im lost - ive cried all day, gone past the suicidal intentions which is still hovering in my head. And now i dont know what to do. Im going to be homless, with no qualifications and well UK is alredy in a terrible economic state - who is going to give me a job with no degree.   I dont have the strength to redo the entire year for something that I should not have gone through in the first place. I am holding on by a hair.       Yeah I keep telling myself there are worse things that could happen and im more fortunate than most and then there are those who say i can pick myself up but the truth is i dont think I can.   worse still - i dont know what I can do now - I never realised how much Medicine meant to me because I cant think of any other job that holds my intrest. And I dont want to return to university any time soon - its far to painful for me to think about it. I need a job or something but I dont know the first thing that I need to do.      I cant believe im so useless - I AM useless and numb.    Please tell me any options that i have. I have to do something to survive I guess.    See even my friends are staying away from me - one 'friend' suggested I could make money as a prostitue since I didnt have any. See everyone has kind of deserted me now. So I have no guidance and I accept that God cant exist and watch me suffer again and again and again ( I had a very traumatic childhood).      Thanxs

HII GUYS!   i have to do an essay about the black music and their infuences!   can u help me??   this is what i have wrote about them but i need their influences now !   can you help me?? and check also my essay   thx    kisses   I think that music is one of the finest performing art:   Without music people could not express themselves in other forums besides through writing and speaking. For example during the Harlem Renaissance black people were able to show their discontent with how the country was being run. Many African Americans used music to get this point across. Music is also a source of entertainment for alot of people. Many children as well as adults take up an instrument so that they can make others happy. This is why I believe music is important.      Most young people white or black will only think about the music that they listen to at the moment. So it's pretty hard to tell you about jazz blues work songs and gospel:         Jazz:   Jazz is a primarily American musical art and , ultimately, the product of New Orleans' melting pot   The abolition of slavery led to new opportunities for education of freed African-Americans, but strict segregation meant limited employment opportunities. Black musicians provided "low-class" entertainment at dances, in minstrel shows, and in vaudeville, and many marching bands formed. Black pianists played in bars, clubs and brothels, and ragtime developed.   Louis Armstrong was the greatest of all Jazz musicians. Armstrong defined what it was to play Jazz. His amazing technical abilities, the joy and spontaneity, and amazingly quick, inventive musical mind still dominate Jazz to this day.      Blues   Blues is a vocal and instrumental form of music based on the use of the blue notes-- notes sung or played at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. It emerged as an accessible form of self-expression in African-American communities of the United States from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, Because of its personalized form, the popularity of blues music among blacks marked a unique period in the history of secular African American song. shouts and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads.      Work songs      Work songs sung by slaves are known by many names around the world. In America, the songs were the foundation for what would eventually become the Blues. Some songs were part of a native heritage and sung to remind the slaves of home, while others were instituted by the slave masters to raise morale, keep slaves working in rhythm, or any number of other purposes. Black American slave songs might be referred to as "chain gang songs" or "spirituals" depending on the context of the song.
