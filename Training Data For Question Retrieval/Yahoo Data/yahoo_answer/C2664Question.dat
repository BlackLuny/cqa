20090220133804AAYBxmI	Pets;Other - Pets	My Netherland dwarf rabbit always bites the other people in the family, but not me. Why?	I am the one that feeds my rabbit, cleans his hutch, plays with him, gets him treats etc. but I am not here everyday and when I am not here when other members in my family (mum, younger brother, 10, older brother, 16) go out to him my rabbit runs away from them and bites them if they go to collect his bowl or whatever. I know I take better care of him than them but it's got to the point where they won't go out when I am at sleepovers or staying at my dads, so I have to go home early in the morning to go feed him and give him his water. They think he is a evil rabbit where I find him very friendly. I have had him for three years and they have never done anything nasty to him but it's like my rabbit (Jet) doesn't like them. I need him to like them. Got any ideas either why he acts like that? Or how I can make Jet not snappy at my family? x
20090220133813AAd5qXh	Pets;Dogs	Rotty pooping blood!!!?	Before i start ill just say that my dog is already at the vet as Im typing this. But im stuck at work and Im so inpatient, I need to know whats going on....          my Rottweiler is almost 3 years old. Always been healthy eating fine... the night before last he was up crying in the night to go outside. He had diarrhea. This morning he wasn't as playful or energetic. He was throwing up and in his vomit was some white stuff that i assumed was flem... My husband and i assumed he had a stomach ache and went to work.. Husband got home to find blood everywhere, he took him out for a walk and he was pooping pure blood.. He said he lost probally about 12 cups...          My dog is at the vet now but has anyone every had this happen before. someone said parvo.. but this only happens in young puppies i thought?????                     one last detail ---- my husband was so scared that he rushed him to the vet without cleaning up the blood (understandable)    However, We also are pet sitting another dog and we have a cat. Im worried if my dog is sick could anything be passed through to my cat???    any thoughts on this

20090220134037AAs3Vwd	Pets;Dogs	Does this mean I could adopt a dog from here?	Ok, so I wanted to adopt another dog. I already have a dog and he is really sweet and loving. He's great with other dogs and kids and just really loves to be around people. I wanted to adopt another APBT from the city shelter. I was looking on the "adoptions list" on petfinder and I was just surfing around.       I looked at the description of what they are and how they adopt out dogs. Here's a quote from the site..       Adopting a friend      "After holding our animals after the required hold period time, we team up with the Humane Society to provide adoption services. Humane Society represenatives select as many animals they can and these lucky animals are spayed/neutered and heartworm/feline leukemia tested, vaccinated and health checked. To adopt a pet from our lost and found list, please visit the humane societies website and complete a request form. An adoption counselor will contact you once the animal has been held for the require holding period and has been selected for adoption. Please understand that most of the animals viewable on our Petfinder site are strays and or/ abandoned, must be held by law for no less than five days. If you find a pet that you are interested in, please be reminded that it may not be available immedeately. "      Then I contacted them and I asked them if they adopted out any APBT's or APBT mixes. They claimed they adopt them out of the city shelter, but not at the humane society because they figured at the humane society, since that where most people go to when looking to adopt a pet in our city, people will not want to adopt them out and they would be taking up most of the space. So they decided that if anyone wants to adopt a APBT or APBT mix, they would have to adopt the dog from the city shelter.       Is it possible that I could adopt another APBT from there or should I adopt another APBT out of a Bully breed rescue ?

20090220134243AA8ZwCp	Pets;Dogs	How can I tell my friend that it's not ok to it smack her dog as punishment?	My friend and her fiance have had a Old English Bulldog (a puppy) for about 6 months now.  They hit her whenever she does something bad, and it pains me to see it.  I know it's wrong, but I don't want to lose her friendship.  Is there a nice way to tell her it's wrong?        I didn't say anything to her right away because it started out as a smack on the nose, but I saw her fiance throw her across the room the other day.  It hurt so much to see the look on the dog's face when that happened.  They also drag her by her collar and she chokes. It is so sad.  I consider all of this abuse.          Is there anything I can do to help this poor puppy, and still keep her friendship?       Thanks

20090220135336AA0gRuU	Pets;Cats	Cat doesn't like to Jump?	My cat Tigger, the only female we have, doesn't like jumping. I find this rather odd. She will only jump up onto something if she can't climb up/pull her self up. She seems perfectly healthy, she's not in pain when she jumps (or doesn't show it at all) She has always been this way, and shes only about 5 years old or so.       Does anyone elses cat do this? Could it just be because shes weird (she is a very strange cat..) or could there be something wrong with her we aren't noticing?

20090220140045AA8Z2Cx	Pets;Dogs	Is it ok to leave a dog inside a car for hours?	Last year I was on this Electronics course during the Summer Holidays to get another qualification to enter University. Anyway while I was there 5 days a week for 4 weeks, I had a lecturer who worked there from about 6/7am till 8pm. And he always said that taking your dog for a walk helps you to think of new ideas. And he only took his dog for a walk at lunch break every day. I don't know much about dogs (even though my mum had a poodle), but other people on my course did ask him every now and then why he kept a dog in there all day. But all he said was as long as he kept the windows open a little, the dog would be fine.      As I said, I don't no taht much about dogs - but I think that's quite cruel to leave him in there all day. And by the way, he works there almost every day of the year - not just when we were there.      So what do you think?

20090220142928AATd9iR	Pets;Dogs	Puppy collar size and name?	Sorry I already asked this question, I just want name ideas too!       I have a collar that we are going to put on a german shepherd lab mix (they think at least!) pup in a few days that is an 8" to 12" collar (they are 2 weeks old and I need to mark the pup). Its a soft adjustable nylon buckle puppy collar. Do you think that size should fit up until the pup is 8 weeks old or should I get another to give to the people with the pups? Will the puppy grow out of it in that time do you think?      The pups are black. A few have white tips on their toes and some have a bit of brown on their feet too. But mainly fully black. I'm most likely getting a girl. These are the names I was thinking of:      Remy   Hannah   Axel (yes for a girl)    Rio      Which one do you like best? Any other suggestions?

Okay we have 4 trips planned this year.      2 of them the dogs can't come with us on.   We are going to Chicago for 4 days early this fall.   Early this summer we are going to Florida for 6 days.      For Easter we are taking the dogs with us to the big family gathering (we are going to NC/SC)   and we are going back mid summer with them for a few days....both times we are going to gatlinburg too with the dogs.         My grandparents used to watch our dogs...but now that they have a dog they said it would be too much trouble to have 3 dogs in their home but they offered to watch my poodle.      I don't want to seperate my dogs.    Boarding well they never got over it.      Boarding was a nightmare and they were supposed to keep them together well we got back to find out they were kept in seperate areas the whole time...and didn't see each other at all....that was 10 days      I do have someone who would take dogs....but they would be split.    As in one person would watch our poodle and the other would watch our mix.         What would you suggest.....is there something better than boarding at the vet?     Should we keep asking family and friends?         Should we just not go?
20090220142646AA0CtMm	Pets;Horses	Why does my horse always spook?	My horse is afraid of everything! How can I make him relax and focus on what he's supposed to do? I'll be cantering along and then he'll see a tree or something and completely stop, perk his ears up and start snorting. It seems like everywhere I go, there's a big scary monster.       Even in the place where I ride him all the time, he spooks. It gets so annoying! Or if he sees a stick that he's never seen before, he freaks out. WHY? how do I make him just relax and focus? I'm always relaxed when I'm riding so I don't know what could be causing him to do this.       He's a 6 year old morgan gelding.      Thanks!

Please before you read, I cant afford a nitrate/ammonia test at the moment, I'm just asking for a ROUGH ESTIMATION, lol, so from the following info, how much longer will my tank take to cycle? Roughly?      1. I have a 24ish Gallon tank.   2. I filled it with water treated/conditioned with aquasafe.   3. I then treated water with 'cycle'   4. I left it with filter and heater for one night   5. Next day I added 2 mollies and live plants   6. 2 days later 1 molly gave birth 2 NINETEEN babies, now in a breeding net   7. I put half a capful of 'cycle' in   8. I feed big mollies once a day and babies 2-3 times a day   9. I have not yet done a water change      So can you estimate from these details how long it might take for the tank to cycle? I'm not that impatient but i have a fish on reserve at my local pet shop and now that the babies have come I don't know how long the cycle will take. The fish have now been in the tank for 8 days. If i did a 50% water change and put some cycle in would it be ready to get the fish perhaps on monday? Please no rude answers, I'm new to this and am not going to do anything without seeking advice first      Thanks

20090220143643AAHEvd1	Pets;Fish	How to change water in a 2 gallon tank?	I am getting ready to buy a male betta fish. i have his home all ready, it is a 2 gallon tank, with a simple under gravel filtration system and it also has a HEATER. i have no experience with fish, or fish tanks, and i am very nervous about changing the water.      i know you cannot "cycle" such a small tank, so i am wondering if this mean that i will have to do FULL water changes?       if so, i am scared that the large temperature difference between the cold NEW clean water from the tap and the warm water from the dirty aquarium will harm or be stressful on my betta.      is it safe to try to get warmer water from the tap, that is close to the water in the heated tank (judging with my finger), and quickly preform the FULL water change? i would plug back in the heater as quick as i could. and of course, i would condition the warm tap water.

It's and oval shape tank, probably 5 inches tall and about 5 inches wide, which is a really good tank. Anyway, I feed him pellet food from the store, I had him since April 2008, and yet still alive, he's like this since around June 2008. He's always sitting down on the surface (like the bottom of his body is laying down, not his side.) His water is the right temperature around 72-74 F. I try putting it in 76 F water and still he's not happy. :( I was wondering, will my fish die soon? What should I do? I'm very attached to my betta, so please help . :)

20090220145644AAyudG1	Pets;Birds	What can I do to help this bird?	I have noticed that there is a wild bird that can't fly that comes to one of my feeders at certain times during the day.  I'm not sure if its wing is broken or what, but I did notice that on its right wing, there is a fairly big spot where there are no feathers, but that was all I could see wrong with it. I feel bad watching it wobble around, as there are a lot of snakes (rattlesnakes and copperheads) where I live, and want to help it until it is healthy again, but I'm not sure what to do.  There was no bleeding or anything like that, but I was wondering if maybe it will heal on its own eventually if I could provide care for it? Any advice would be appreciated!
20090220151745AAaZDgN	Pets;Dogs	Chihuahua odd eating habits?	My mother passed away last October and I adopted her little Chihuahua dog. She is about 8 years old and is a very sweet little dog and after a short period of depression (about 5 weeks) she has adapted very well to her new home since my mother's death. But there is something odd about her eating habits which I have never seen another dog do.      She has a healthy appetite and I feed her twice a day plus a couple snack treats mid day and evening. But she will not take a snack from my hand, not even when she is on my lap. I have to drop it on the floor and then she will cautiously sneak up on it and nip at it and quickly back away from it a few times before she will finally snatch it up and eat it. Likewise, when I feed her morning and evening, she will cautiously sneak up on her food bowl like she is afraid of it and nip at the food and quickly back away until she finally snatches a piece of food and then quickly back away from the bowl to eat it. She will do that over and over again until her food bowl is empty. And what is even more strange is that her food bowl is exactly like her water bowl and right beside her water bowl but she does not sneak up on her water bowl. She just bravely walks up to her water bowl and drinks her fill.      I am wondering if there are any other Chihuahua owners here who has noticed the same odd behavior?

And please please please, dont remind that the bala shark grows too big and i will need to return it, because i already have a plan for when he grows big, which is selling him because it is VERY rare to buy a full grown bala shark as they grow super slow and take a long time to do so, as well as "they need a school", because i took an hour checking trough all of the bala shark's care profiles websites, and 100% of them told me i COULD keep him alone, but i almost never ignore that rule. so please focus on my question and not on ur comments or opinions plox

20090220144417AAE9ArF	Pets;Dogs	Questions about tapeworms?	Ok so i got a new puppy last saturday which was 6 days ago. he ended up having tapeworms. He got treated for them on monday. Well ever since i have been so incredibly scared that myself or my kids are going to get these worms since i seen we can get them! I mean sick to my stomach worried! I guess my questions are has anybody gotten tapeworms after their pet had them? How long would it take to see if you had them? (like how long would it be before the segments showed in your stool) Is it common or is it looked at as repulsive by a doctor if you go in and say ummm i think i have worms? Im just so paranoid because i have never dealt with an animal or a person for that matter that has had any kind of worms so its really freaking me out. I know this is the dog category but since it started with my dog and you all are dog lovers and possibly had experience with this..i decided to post here. Any advice or insight would be appreciated! Thank you!

20090220144629AAIEFrK	Pets;Dogs	Cycle Natural Adult Dog Food?	I used to feed my dogs Purina, but I decided that I should feed them something healthier. I went and bought Science Diet, because it's vet recommended, right? Well, after doing research, I found that it really isn't as healthy as they want you to think, and that there's many better options out there. I live in a small town, so alot of the dog foods I found listed that were healthier with natural ingredients and no by-products, I couldn't find in the stores around here. I did find one dog food that I think is comparable, though, so I wanted to list the ingredients and see what everyone else thought...the dog food is called Cycle Natural, and from their website, it's only available at Food Lion (where I bought it), Safeway, Price Chopper and Giant Eagle. Here are the ingredients:      Chicken Meal, Whole Corn, Whole Wheat, Soybean Meal, Poultry Fat, Pearled Barley, Brewers Rice, Animal Digest, Oatmeal, Vegetable Blend (Peas, Carrots & Green Beans), Beets, Salt, Flax Seed, Dried Chicory Root, Alfalfa Nutrient Concentrate, Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Niacin Supplement, D-Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement), Choline Chloride, Minerals (Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Manganous Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Caldium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Rosemary Extract

20090220102926AAtaFhe	Pets;Cats	Is my cat overweight?	She is a good shape overall, but at 1 year of age is developing a "keel" of loose skin or fat under her belly.  She has been neutered.  She is not particularly active (it is apparently a breed characteristic) and she is greedy but we make sure she only gets the recommended amount of food.  Should we cut down on food, encourage more playfulness, or is she fine as she is?
20090220161251AAV00uM	Pets;Cats	What did I do to make my cat Underfoot mad at me?	All week long he has been horrible to me. I know he is mad at me because he intentionally misses the litter box and in general avoids me except when he wants his dinner. He has never acted like this towards me before, I just wonder what did I do? Everything seems to be the same other than I changed his brand of catnip. Do you think he is mad at me about his catnip?

20090220154425AABnZFu	Pets;Dogs	Question about the health of dogs?	I looked into the breed of dog I want and found out it's prone to hip dysplasia and congenital heart disease. I researched each one but still want to now how I can prevent them.      For hip dysplasia I read that you can't let your dog get overweight, and that you should do muscle-building exercises such as running and swimming but stay away from frisbee as the jumping causes straining on their joints, and then feed supplements as they get older. Does this sound accurate? I plan on rescuing so I won't know the parents so I don't know if they have it or not, so I want to be extra careful! At what age should I start feeding the supplements? Or should I start right when they turn two?      As for congenital heart disease I haven't a clue! How should I go about preventing this? And precautions I should take?      The breed is American Pit Bull Terrier. Apparently they also are prone to hereditary cataracts and allergies, but I don't see how you can prevent those. But if you have any suggestions for them thanks!      Thank you to all helpful answers!

20090220160129AAIkwwN	Pets;Dogs	Some training tips???????????	OK, so im training my newly-acquired german shepherd a few commands. She's reacting very well to the new environment and loves people of all sorts. She doesn't like other dogs all that much. Anyways, I cant get very close to her. She like me, it's just she likes to climb on me, and i don't care for a hyper dog getting a little too close to my face. She will eventually listen when you tel her to sit, but she doesn't know how to stay. My question(s) are: How do  reward my dog for good behavior without stuffing her with treats? How can I potty-train her? Some good books on dog training? Irrelevant, but anybody got any recipes on cooking for my dog? AND finally, my pup has been on kibble for the last and only seven months of her life, at least i think so. However, I have a can of dog food too. How much should I feed her (can food, I already know how much for the kibble) and will it upset her stomach badly?

If it is not purple and maybe just something fun that is ok :) But she will be doing jumping (just started cuz she is turning 4 soon) and small amounts of western as I am only a beginner.

Hello,      I recently got some fish oil capsules for my cat from my vet, and I was wondering, what exactly is fish oil? I mean, I know it's good to give to your pets, and for us humans to include it in our foods, but where does the oil actually come from? I would assume its from fish, but how? Is it raw? Is it like sushi? Is it an imitation? My vet told me that the fish oil I got was made specially for cats and dogs, and it's FDA approved.      Thanks in advance!
20090203052051AAbyvf2	Pets;Dogs	My dog thinks his poop is a tasty snack?	How do I get him to stop eating it?       1) He only started doing it after we moved to a new state 2 weeks ago.      2) I feed him Innova and have for the past 4 months, so I doubt it's a vitamin deficiency issue.       3) I have a bag ready to pick it up as he goes, but as it comes out he's looking at it and manages to scarf down a stray remnant before I can pick it up. YUCK!       Has your dog done this before, where it HASN'T been a vitamin deficiency? How did you get him/her to stop?      My dog is a 10.5-month-old black lab mix, about 60 pounds.

20081004151134AASM7Gf	Pets;Horses	Why is it that some people think........?	Why is it that some people think that horses should not be trained to jump until they are at least five, personally i think it's ridiculous. A horse should be trained to jump and lightly schooled at three and are allowed to compete at four (obviously not strenuously). Otherwise you are leaving it too late.

20090220155435AA3Iw7m	Pets;Dogs	Advice on  getting my dog spayed?	Today I adopted the most awesome dog on the planet from a local shelter.  She is a min pin chihuahua mix, much smaller than I thought she would be. (5 pounds!). She is 6 months old.  I am taking her to the vet on Monday for a check up,as well as to get her shots microchip etc. (Apparently she has never received a shot).        My vet has asked me if I want to do blood work on her to check the level of her kidneys and heart (to see if she is at risk for anesthesia), as well as if I want to put her on fluids (which apparently just makes the transition a little easier).  I do want to make sure that she is safe and healthy, however these things bring the cost up by quite a bit. (120.00) and after spending 400.00 just today... I am not wanting to spend more than what is needed.        So what do you think?  Would you do the blood work and/or put your dog on fluids for a spay surgery?

I'm 15 and my familys had our beta Fred for a good 4 or 5 years but, its time for him to go.   For the past few months his health has been decreasing dramatically.   He doesn't even have the ability to swim anymore. He just lays at the bottom of the gravel. Even when we transfer him to the bowl to the sink to clean his bowl, he doesnt even get excited or anything. He just flops and lays there.   He doesn't eat anymore. He hasn't in months. I thought that would be his cause of passing but nothing is happening.    We still take care of him but the little guy is obviously at the end of his road and in pain.   His gills are going so heavily just so he can breathe, he looks so miserable in there.   I'd like to know a way to send him to heaven that would cause no pain to him and that he won't see coming.   Please dont say anything where i have to hit him or something, i cant deal with that.   Please please please don't say anything mean about it, i wouldn't do it if i didnt have to.   Thanks,   Dani :'(

After I brought him home and placed him with my other budgie, they started to fight.      Well I'm not sure if it was fighting or not, but the older budgie (he's about 7-9 months old), got close to him and started to nibble on the other ones beak. Then he nibbled on the other ones feathers on the wing and neck.      After I put them in the cage it seemed they were fighting. I decided to separate them.       I also noticed that the new budgie keeps its right eye open, while the other one was closed. He/she still opens it though, but why does it open one eye and keep the other closed?         Also how long should I keep them separated?      The older budgie is a male and I'm not sure about the other one since it is about 1-3 months old.      Oh and only the older budgie was messing with the little one.

I have a couple of "answering rules" though, so read these first please.      1. No breed selection quizzes. These only help you see what you would like or need in a dog, and I already know that.      2. Don't come at me with random dog breeds because those are the only breed names that you know. If you do not know, do not answer.      3. Please don't say, "Don't set your mind on a breed, adopt from a shelter." I want to be able to show. And PLEASE don't rant and rave about that either.      That's it for the rules, now for what I want/need in a dog. Read carefully, okay?      PERSONALITY      I need a dog that is a little social, but not as social as a Lab. It needs to be a dog that is semi-good with kids, because it will OCCASIONALLY be around them. The dog REALLY needs to be good with cats. I have 3 at the moment.       EXERCISE      I'm able to provide a 2-3 mile walk every day, and an hour or two of playtime everyday. I'd really like to teach him to fetch. He also needs to be able to swim, since we have a pool.       ETC      I need a dog that isn't a heavy shedder. No major droolers either, mainly because we have a landlord. I'll be at home 3/4 of the day, mainly because I have school. I'd like it to be a one person type of dog that will mainly be close to me, but he should tolerate others too.      Thank you for putting up with me!

20090220160516AArykvL	Pets;Cats	Is it bad to pick your cat up by the skin on the back of her neck?	I was curious. My brother grabbed my cat by the skin on the back of her neck to pick her up and it scared me and I told him not to, even though I know that as a kitten, their mother does the same. It didn't SEEM to bother her, she's only five months old, but does anyone know whether this irritates them or not?      (: thanks!

20090220162755AAnHj8b	Pets;Dogs	When is it safe to let a puppy off leash?	Bella is a 5 1/2 month old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with lots and lots and lots of energy. We have a small backyard so she doesnt get to run for long distances. We bought a retractable lead and started taking her to the dog park, she stays reasonably close to me and keeps checking that im still there, she comes to be when i call her outside of home, but when i call her inside home she just ignores me, i dont know whether its just because she feels insecure outside the home and wants to be near me or some other reason, but i want to let her off the lead soon. I started letting her off the lead just out in the front yard and she comes back to the sound of shaking the packed of liver treats. She also comes to the sound of her squeaky toy. But i am too nervous to let her off lead at a dog park yet because im scared she wont come back and both of our dog parks are dangerous, one has high cliffs near by and the other has deep water. Any tips in training her to come back?

We live in the country on 15 acres, and had 8 cats all fixed, recently a pit-bull mix has come around and killed one of them on two different occasions. I have asked the neighbor if it is theirs, and was told no.  I called Animal Control from the local city, but was told that the dog would run into the woods and the could not keep sending someone out.  My husband has been bitten by the dog, and we have tried traps. I am at my wits end.  The cats have been kept up in the house now.  But the dog is still a nuisance.

I noticed a bald spot on amber's last week but she has quite long fur and it gets matted up easily so I'd just presumed she'd pulled one out. Now Snuffy who has short fur has one on his back.    Neither cats seem to be upset by it, I know its not fleas and had sort of mentally ruled out ring worm due to it bald spot not being round, red or sensitive.    I'd also ruled out stress and OCD because it's on both of them and then not the third.   Does anyone know why this might have happened?   Thanks

And please please please, dont remind that the bala shark grows too big and i will need to return it, because i already have a plan for when he grows big, which is selling him because it is VERY rare to buy a full grown bala shark as they grow super slow and take a long time to do so, as well as "they need a school", because i took an hour checking trough all of the bala shark's care profiles websites, and 100% of them told me i COULD keep him alone, but i almost never ignore that rule. so please focus on my question and not on ur comments or opinions plox
20090220150044AAkstWS	Pets;Dogs	My Vet is recommending Eukanuba or Iams...Am I wrong?	I have been feeding good food since I have had my dog two and half years. I started with Wellness Puppy food, then we use Natures Variety for a while. I currently use "Taste Of the Wild" plus I feed a few raw meals a week. Don't worry I am not switching   I was just taken back when the Vet said that the natural foods are really no good. He said my dog could get sick or I can get sick from the food. The only thing I could say is, there is fooling my health. I have had allergies and asthma my whole live. A dog that is feed cheap grocier store food bothers me. For some strang reason a dog that is feed food/raw food does not bother me. I wake up with my Schnauzer in my face. The only time I sneeze is when he is dirty.       So I don't understand how a person reading the ingredients of food says that cheap Iams is better then Holistic foods.
20090220120659AARqaEw	Pets;Fish	Well fishkeepers what would be the opposite of keeping a betta in a bowl?	every day on ya i hear people complaining about bettas in tiny cups at pet stores and i see their point but i was just wondering what would be the alternative besides not selling them at all? and some of you are going to say put a betta in a 5 gallon tank with a heater and filter blah blah blah but then that would cost money. and that store would have to charge more money for their merchandise and then people would complain that it cost too much money. Then i was thinking....put dividers in each tank and put one type of fish on one side and the betta on the other side....but then the other species of fish would be cramped. or mix the bettas in with community fish, one per tank. but some bettas are mean to community fish and some community fish are mean to bettas, and this gives customers a false impression of aquarium keeping (ex. the pet store put a betta in with tetras, why can't i put a betta in w my gold fish). so besides just not selling them what would be your solution to not keeping pet store bettas in tiny cups?

20090220153828AAmwOql	Pets;Dogs	Dog Dominance HELP!!!!?	Well, this morning a light bulb went off and we figured something out.    We had no idea but Maggie (a pug/rat terrier mix 15 lbs) tries to hump Brandy (7lb chihuahua) and that is what causing all the issues.       I know 'humping' is a sign of dominance. At times there is no warning that it is going to happen.       I need to change this behaviour NOW! and I need your help.       Maggie also humps our new dog but he doesn't have a problem with it and he is bigger so when it bothers him he just stands up and walks away.      My questions: Does Maggie think she is a higher rank than the other dogs?   How do I show her she isn't? If anything I would rather the smaller dog be of higher rank, is this something I can decide or should I just allow Maggie to be higher? If I did allow her to be of higher status would this stop of the fights? I'm worried it would encourage her to do what she is doing.      I'm going to contact a behaviourist but what can I do in the mean time?

20090220145521AAoW9bY	Pets;Dogs	Are my dogs playing or fighting?	We just got a new dog a couple of days ago named Zoe, who is 25 pounds and about 10-12 months old, and we kept her seperated from Bailey, our original dog, (who is three times her weight and height, and four years old) through an extended gate.   Anyway, they play together, but I'm not sure if the play is all that happy-go-lucky. it seems kind of tense to me. Bailey puts his paws over her back,growls,  and bites the back of her neck & upper back..although he never breaks skin or anything. But Zoe also puts her paws over him and growls occasionally too, and kind of bites him, but again, very lightly. Maybe im just worrying too much, but when they play it gets pretty intense, in terms of it being very high energy and moving all over the place. So does it sound like they're just playing or does it sound like it's a little too tense? Especially since he is so much bigger than her?      But then today they were playing tug of war when suddently Bailey barked and growled at her and she yipped and ran away.    Also, Zoe  will take Bailey's toy from his mouth, but he won't try to take it from hers. When he has tried, she kind of bites at him (playfully), and he doesn't try again. Why does he not try to take it from her  mouth but she takes it from his mouth? Even though he is the dominant one.

20090220133523AAKkDsY	Pets;Dogs	My dog had a reaction to sedation is he okay?	i just got back from the vet with my basset hound/cocker spaniel. the vet needed to look in his mouth and my dog wouldnt allow him too. the vet sedated him so he could look, but my dog apparently is very sensitive to the stuff and had a bad reaction and his heart rate started to drop. so he gave him something else to reverse it and the heart rate went back to noraml. The vet said he should be fine later today but somehow i'm still  worried. he's been sleeping and "out of it" for 4 and half hours. is he just sleeping it off, or could it still be effecting him?

Plus she pees when she gets excited. We've tried everything to potty train her! We out a bell on the door for her to ring when she has to go out, and she did well for a while, but then she just rang the bell to go run around in the yard. Then, as soon as we take her back inside, she waits til she's out of our sights and goes to the bathroom!       Based on your own experiences, what is the best way to housebreak a dog, especially a dachshund, and get her to stop peeing when she's excited???

20090220153905AAxP2Yz	Pets;Dogs	Dog walking question?	Okay well recently i have started going on walks with my friend and her dog. We are 14 & 15 years old . Once i was holding her dogs lead and she said to me "Don't let her walk ahead of you because then she thinks shes the boss of you. You have to at least have your feet ahead of her". I thought this sounded stupid and asked her about it and then she said "Because with wolves the leader of the pack is always at the front and dogs are like wolves."      I think this is really stupid and she should let her dog walk ahead of her. What do you think ? Thanks

20090220151041AAvR7HF	Pets;Dogs	Dog breeding and the rules?  Who gets first pick -Ect?	I moved in a house with other house mates. I had moved my dog in and they told me there female dog had just got outta heat recently, so we thought it would be fine to wait a while to save up money to get my male fixed.       Well the female turned out to be preggy. She had her pups and about 2 weeks later my mom asked if she could have my dog, so I gave him to her (since he paid for him.) of course everyone told me I could get a new puppy. So I decided why don't I keep one of my dogs pups?       When then the household decided they didn't want any of that breed in the backyard. Okay... so we decided to find new homes for all the puppy's. So my step father called me and I told him he could come pick on up. (decided the biggest one would be best for him my step dad is a wonderful dog owner. So he was going to go to a good home.)       Then the "Father" of my household decided HE wanted to keep the biggest pup around. I was thinking I would be able to keep/name/train/ect the pup so we hid it from my step father and gave him another one.       Well as it turned out, the "Father" of the house wanted the pup, he now claims its "HIS" dog. This morning his g/f told me "Don't feed the puppy-hes doing special training with him."        Um excuse me?!       I'm a little offended. Normally doesn't the "male" owner get 1st pick and most the time they pick the biggest pup?
20090220151220AAlz440	Pets;Horses	Which do you like better?	I'm looking for a yearling filly to train and show in pleasure.    I show in a local circuit called WSCA, and there are Halter, Bareback Horsemanship, Western Pleasure, Western Horsemanship, English Pleasure, English Equitation and Driving classes at every show, plus the state fair and WSCA Champ Show. So my filly will hopefully be a great all-around horse, but we'll for sure compete in all the classes (probably not driving, but who knows). I'll also do some APHA or AQHA.       So here are two APHA fillies I'm looking at right now. I've gone to look at the buckskin filly, and have been talking to the owner of the other one. I took my trainer out to see her, etc. And I will have vet checks done. My friends have seen them too - I just want more opinions.       So here they are. :)        http://www.dreamhorse.com/show_horse.php...        http://www.dreamhorse.com/show_horse.php...       FYI : I'm buying a foal mostly because I'm looking for a training project. I am 16 years old, have plenty of experience and have the support and help whenever needed of my riding instructor who has trained several foals and started many horses under saddle. I'll be headed off to college in a couple years, so there's a 50% chance I'll sell the horse then.       Give me your honest opinions. :)    Thanks in advance.

20090220155012AAO21iu	Pets;Cats	Can cats who have feline leukemia have an off-putting odor?	I'm a first-time cat owner.  I took two kittens that are leukemia positive from a rescue center.  They had lost their mother, and were put to nurse--in error--on a leukemia positive mommy cat, which is how they got it.      I'm new to EVERYTHING about cat ownership and cats, as I resisted getting any for YEARS due to allergies.  But my son wanted one desperately, and so I relented and stocked up on antihistimines.  But being new to cats means I don't know what's normal and what's not, or what might be due to the leukemia or not.      I've noticed that the cats often stink, like they've been rolling in poo, or haven't wiped their butts.  Despite that smell, I know they nevertheless do groom themselves often, and so I wondered if maybe other cats have a subtle odor too.  Other cat owners I've asked have all said no, theirs don't smell after they poo.  So I have to wonder--am I just especially sensitive to the smells of a cat, because I'm new to them?  Or could my kitties smell somehow because of their leukemia?        Spooky and Boo are sisters from the same litter, and are about 5 months old.  Spooky is much tinier than Boo, though.  They're in good health right now, other than the fact that Boo often gets weepy eyes.  In fact, Boo, more than Spooky, smells enough that I don't let her get on my lap, as the smell is that noticeable.  Spooky's smell isn't consistently there, and isn't as strong.  In both cases, but especially with Boo, the smell will persist even after having bathed them, which I do roughly bi-weekly to control allergens.  Boo has, in the past when sick, had an odd odor that we couldn't seem to identify the source of--couldn't tell if it was coming from her butt, the goop from her eyes, or her breath...sometimes it seemed like it was emanating from all of her, or that her fur stunk.  Right now I don't smell that, though--only poo.      I've caught Spooky on more than one occasion actually laying in the kitty litter, just hanging out...so that might be why they smell--but I honestly don't think it's something they do all the time.  And if that IS the culprit of the smell...do other cats do the same, and why????  Their kitty litter does get smelly very fast, and I've gone through kitty litter very quickly--more quickly than normal, I'm told.  Any feedback???

20090220155353AAygRlW	Pets;Dogs	Small Dogs Big Nightmare?	What do you do when you have a very intelligent small dog who weighs less than 5lbs so when she's in trouble she knows where to hide where daddy cant get to her. Under the dining room table, under the bed, uneith the end tables...My question is how can you discipline a dog  you can't get to! I have blocked most of her entry ways into these places but I can't barricade my whole house! For those of you who have small dogs can you suggest to me what I could do about this. I know it's a difficult question but I have learned that if she does something bad that disciplining her 20 mins. later has no effect and at which point she doesn't understand why she is in trouble at that point. Any suggestion would be helpful.

20090203063758AAgH2O9	Pets;Dogs	Potty training my puppy HELP!!!!?	My husband and I got a beautiful black lab puppy aboout a month ago.  When we got him he was already doing really good with paper training.  Over all he does pretty good about telling us when he's got to go outside. Sometimes he has an accident and goes on the floor and we stick his nose in it and smack him.  He gets rewarded with a treat for going outside and punished for going inside. However at nights we put him in a cage, and everymorning we take him out first thing.  But by then he doesnt have to go because he just goes all over his cage, poop and pee. How do I teach the dog that he has to hold it, and how do I get him to stop having accidents inside? Is there a trick to all of this?
