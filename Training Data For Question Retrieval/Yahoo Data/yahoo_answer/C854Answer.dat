BoAEgaAGaa	You will only be allowed to deduct medical expenses that exceed 7-1/2% of your adjusted gross income.  Example if you AGI is $50,000 then you could only deduct the amount above $3750.  Then you would have to have enough other expenses allowed, such as real estate taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions and many other items,  to be able to use Sch. A to itemize your deductions.  You either are allowed to deduct your standard deduction for your filing status or your itemized deductions.    As for the amount of medical expenses being a maximum, it is only limited by the amount you can legally prove that you spent in 2008.

Only those that exceed 7.5% of your AGI are deductible though.  Also keep in mind that purely cosmetic treatment is not deductible.  The braces could be an issue unless the misalignment was so sever so as to interfere with eating or normal dental care.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Sky's the limit.|`|on9xLWegaa	if the instructions on the Schedule D (itemized returns) don't give a max then it's not a problem.    Only the amounts over 7.5% of your taxable income will count, by the way.|`|yO5tm6e1aa	There is no maximum.  You can claim all $14,000.  However, you cannot claim as part of that $14K any pretax money (i.e. money set aside in a Health Care Reimbursement Account which has a $5,000 annual cap and of which the money is taken before your taxable income is computed).    You'll notice once you start filling in Schedule D that only the medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of your Adjusted Gross Income will count.  Of course, you'll need to claim all $14K before the form calculations start subtracting 7.5% of your medical expenses to arrive at the value of your deduction.    Having the medical deduction may not be enough to cause you to itemize.  You may also need sigificant charity and/or mortgage interest payments to make Schedule D deductions exceed the personal exceptions you get without filling this form.|`|c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	Your medical expense have no limit BUT your itemized deductions may.

Contact me at cambiz@comcast.net.|`|SK2gGFoyaa	First of all congratulations on having an idea, filling a need (or creating one), and knowing vaguely your target market. What you need to consider is your competition. There are a number of products like the one you're thinking out there... how are they selling? what is the cost of goods and what is the sell price? that's how you determine profits. Realize that alot of products are outsourced to other countries because of the cheap labor. How much money can you expect to earn to make the venture worthwhile? You have to consider inventory, taxes, licenses, advertising, plus your own time. Will it be profitable??? You can make sweaters, beds, belts and even high heel shoes for pets but they have to sell and be affordable to the consumer and profitable to you or the business is a flop. Do more research and create a business plan. Your advertising can be in the form of partnering with pet shelters, website, fashion shows, press releases, word of mouth, etc. Unless you know what you are doing and how you are doing it, your plans will remain ideas. Do something TODAY to go to the next level. Check out Score or COSE for a mentor. Get a library book on business planning. Do Google searches on keywords relating to your products.
nLu8OC1Xaa	The question is a bit simplistic but in order to give a realistic answer which can serve to guide the inquirer, I will put some assumptions: a)  monthly savings of $5000, b) target future value of $1M, c) rate of interest on the saved amount - 10% per annum.    Now using the above assumptions, we can calculate for the time period required to reach the coveted $1M.    The answer is 118.19 months or roughly 9.8 years of saving $5,000 per month at the rate of 10% per annum interest.  Of course, the higher the interest earned the shorter the period or conversely, the lower the interest earned, the longer the period it takes to achieve the $1M mark.    Assuming further just for the sake of discussion that you simply hide your money under your pillow and never allow it to earn any interest elsewhere, then you will take 200 months or roughly 16.67 years to accumulate $1M.|`|AA11616170	If he is an investment banker who is good at his job, he will have each $5,000 put where it will gain most interest.

GBgch3d0aa	Buenas... A su pregunta: es cierto que el dinero es fabricado (acu?ado) por cada pas, sin embargo, la acumulacin de este no es per se, la riqueza de un pas o comunidad, solamente se utiliza como el producto ms fungible de todos (porque tiene la capacidad liberatoria de obligaciones), facilitando los intercambios de productos y/o servicios, entre los usuarios, anteriormente solo representaba la proporcionalidad de oro que tena cada pas, en sus correspondientes reservas. Hay q tener en cuenta una referencia elemental, el dinero por si solo no crea la riqueza, solo la representa y esa es su razn de ser. Si la riqueza, producida por una economa se anquilosa o disminuye, un aumento de la cantidad de dinero, no solucionara el problema. Si esto no fuera as, todos los pases econmicamente pobres, podran generar riqueza a base de acu?ar dinero, mediante sus respectivos Bancos Centrales, saliendo de esta forma de cualquier caresta, pero si estuviramos verbi gratia, en un paraje donde no existiera ni siquiera alimento y estuviramos apunto de morir de inanicin, y tuviramos un milln de euros, dlares u otra moneda fuerte en la mano, esto no servira de nada, no valdra nada, por la ausencia de bienes en ese pas (riqueza).|`|N53Wpvolaa	No tendria caso hacer mucho dinero..................................... al hacerlo comensarian las devaluaciones y los precios altisimos|`|FTmG11waaa	En el caso de Mxico la moneda es echa por la casa de moneda, misma que esta regida por el banco de mexico............ y los paises no pueden hacer ms dinero que el se pueda respaldar por oro (por poner un ejemplo).........

AA11225694	I graduated with a degree in computer information systems. I quit the job to work with youth with mental health issues. It was an immediate 50 percent pay cut and working longer hours. That was almost 9 years ago. I was scared I was being a complete idiot and ruining a promising career. It was one of the best decisions of my life. I will never make the money computer stuff offered. On the other hand that career would never have given me the opportunity to make a change in others lives like this has. It has worked out great so far.  Go for what you have a passion for.

If you quit your job it doesn't matter, they can get judgement and go after your assets. They can have your wages garnished if you started working again and could even go after your bank account.

c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	I think in the long run, gas prices will go up -  there's too much  world demand and limited resources.

I think Republicans feel that they are vulnerable on the high gasoline prices.  That's ironic considering the Democrats have squelched domestic production and the building of new refineries.    I can't help but have this sick feeling that Republicans are manipulating prices until after the elections.  It's a shame that I, as a conservative, have no political party to represent me.|`|AA12086106	Depends on the weather.

da7d75089122106d7950607b06ee795faa	I'm a senior at a business college right now and my sister and my uncle have both opened their own businesses, so hopefully I can give some insight. I'm always told the  1 rule for opening your own business is: "have enough money set aside and treat your finances like you're not going to see any profits for the first year, because you may not." Also, expect to work around 60-70 hours a week for the first few years, if not longer. Don't kid yourself into thinking you can take a poor location and make it a hot spot. Pay a little more on rent to get a nicer building in a high traffic location. You have to spend money to make money. Lastly, expect the unexpected. Small business owners shouldn't expect to have much of a structured schedule, as things can happen at any time. If all this sounds like something you can handle in order to start making a decent amount of money in about 2 or 3 years, good luck and have fun! It is a lot of work, but seeing your creative design come to life and put into action is a lot of fun.    If you think you may not have time for all that, you can always open a franchise such as Quizno's. You don't get creative control, but you already have all your distrubutors set up, a business plan, and you do get a large amount of the profits.|`|AA11382947	To make a lasting Business, you will need to invest heavily of your time and sacrifice disposable income for at least the first 3 years, that is, if you are successful.    It would be next to impossible to start a legitimate business and me making a comfortable living within a year.  And the road to success is full of pot-holes, trying to make to much to quick normally leads to short-cuts that derail even a good business plan.    Start with a Business plan.  Be realistic in your expectations, and LOVE whatever you are starting.      It would be helpful if your girlfriend also enjoyed whatever you are getting into, or at least have reasonable expectations about how much time and money you are going to have to invest.  She should also know that the Company has to come first, even if it means that she might not be able to buy that new dress, or you may have to skip a vacation or two.    If either one of you have reservations, I suggest you stick to your 9-5 job, and cut a few personal expences to budget for your future.    Starting a Business just for the money and expecting to be on easy street within a year would scare me as an investor.    How are you BOTH going to feel when you are putting in 80 hours per week and making less than you do right now?  Think about it and talk with her about it as well.    With luck, and hard work, you might see some increase in standard of living within 3-4 years, and if you are willing to pay big $$$ to a manager, you might be down to working a semi-normal week.

AA11287657	Companies like Avon succeed because of their "exclusivity", ie. you can only buy their products from an Avon representative, and from their catalogues.  This method of selling, and similar "Party Plan" selling can be very successful because it targets a market that look for products they can't get anywhere else.  If Avon sold products in department stores and on net they would put themselves up against too much competition, lose their exclusivity, and business.

Silver is one of the master colors, and has the key word ILLUMINATION. People with a lot of this color are usually multi-talented, but may not be fully conscious of their own extensive abilities, even when others are greatly impressed.    They sometimes let idealism make them impractical. However, in the right atmosphere, they can advance to the top of a profession very quickly.    There is usually some tension or stress related to this color, which can interfere with the ability to perform to full capacity.    The second color in your Aura is Blue.    FREEDOM is the key word for sandeep. People whose auras contain a lot of blue generally hate any personal restrictions.    Although they may sometimes appear a bit immature and rebellious, they are naturally talented in many different ways, and good at dealing with the unexpected.

9232e4ee7948d72d11b003b67ba4a690aa	If your husband is firm about letting Joe go, there's no easy way to do it.  It's kind of like ripping off the band aid.  Fast is better than slow.  But, both will hurt.  Approach it as tactfully and kindly as possible.  Expect things to be bitter.    You mention the communication problem, but not if any steps have been taken to fix it in whatever 'training' Joe has been getting.  You also don't really mention anything about the business and why Joe's communication skills are so important.    There may be some shortcuts that could be taken to improve things or Michael could become the 'face & voice' while Joe becomes the back-up man doing most of the grunt work.    Sometimes it's possible to script things out for staff short on communication skills (telemarketers do it all the time) or work on training Joe in some communication basics.    Once again, without knowing more about the actual work, work history and training it's hard to say.  My 'nice guy' side says to give the guy another chance.  Lay out the problem & plan a solution with benchmarks for Joe to reach in set times.  Then, if he doesn't make them, you're on much stronger ground to justify letting him go.    Sometimes trying to solve the problem as a family is better than trying to solve it as a business equation.  My brothers tried a construction company working from the 'business' angle & it failed miserably.  But, each family is different.    Send more details if you like.    Best of Luck!    PSq?

Does he have any kind of learning disability that you know of?|`|3388eef71a492c26e281234ab27fcaf3aa	I know the feeling, but no matter how helpful you want to be it's never a good idea to hire friends or family.

5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	According to the US Dept of Labor, this job is hot:    *Medical assistants is projected to be one of the fastest growing occupations over the 2004-14 period.   *Job prospects should be best for medical assistants with formal training or experience, particularly those with certification.   *Some medical assistants are trained on the job, but many complete 1- or 2-year programs in vocational-technical high schools, postsecondary vocational schools, and community and junior colleges.     So what is the required Training for Medical Assisting:  Most employers prefer graduates of formal programs in medical assisting. Such programs are offered in vocational-technical high schools, postsecondary vocational schools, and community and junior colleges. Postsecondary programs usually last either 1 year, resulting in a certificate or diploma, or 2 years, resulting in an associate degree.     FYI: Although medical assistants are not licensed, some States require them to take a test or a course before they can perform certain tasks, such as taking x rays or giving injections.    For a list of educational programs in medical assisting accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs, contact:    Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs, 1361 Park St., Clearwater, FL 33756.

Das Kndigungsschutzgesetz greift erst nach dieser Zeit ( nach 6 Monaten).  Quelle: 1 KSchG    Eine Kndigung danach kann entweder aus betriebsbedingten oder aus verhaltensbedingten Grnden erfolgen. Die heutige Rechtsprechung geht in vielen F?llen davon aus das eine einmalige Abmahnung alleine nicht mehr aussreicht um verhaltensbedingt zu kndigen. In den meisten F?llen mu? eine 2.

fHw9jCkNaa	You deposit money into a sharebuilder account.  It's just like a bank account.  If that's all you ever do, then you'll earn a little bit of interest.  But you'll want to see what the rest of the site has to offer.    Once you have money in your sharebuilder account, you select which company you'd like to buy stock in.  You can spend all your money on one stock or you can spend a little bit on 30 different stocks.  It's all up to you.    From there on, it's all up to the stock market.  If your stock goes up, then you can go into your sharebuilder account and sell it and pocket the money.    Sharebuilder makes money by charging you a fee every time you buy stock.  I believe it's like 15 bucks for the pricing plan that I chose.    Another neat feature is that you can set up sharebuilder to automatically take some money out of your bank account every month and buy stock with it.  This way, over time, you end up owning a lot of stock without having to bother with doing it all yourself.    I've used sharebuilder for a few months now and I'm pretty happy with it.  E*trade, Scott Trade, and some other websites do the same thing, but I've never used them so I can't say whether or not they are better.    Sharebuilder is good for newbies though.  If you already know a lot about investing, then I've heard Scott Trade is cheaper.

39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	Le modle de maturit CMM  (Capability Maturity Model)  est longtemps demeur l'apanage des socits de services nord-amricaines et indiennes. Lesquelles ont popularis le concept, s'en servant comme argumentaire marketing en Europe afin d'attirer les prestations offshore. Les SSII fran?aises, jusque-l rticentes  les adopter, y viennent  leur tour. Lentement, mais s?rement. Un mouvement qui co?ncide avec l'closion de centres de services et de dveloppement dans l'organisation des SSII.    Jusqu' maintenant, ce sont surtout les socits les plus exposes  une concurrence internationale qui ont fait le choix d'investir dans une dmarche de certification CMM ou CMMI (pour ? Integrated ?). Par ce procd, elles cherchent  homogniser leurs pratiques. L'objectif tant,  terme, de dvelopper des logiciels selon des processus identiques, quel que soit le lieu de dveloppement. Le label qualit CMM se rvle de plus en plus demand par les grands comptes dans le contexte de projets internationaux.    La qualification CMM reprsente une dmarche dynamique, tourne vers l'amlioration progressive des processus et la diffusion dans l'entreprise de bonnes pratiques couvrant des domaines cls : gestion des exigences, planification de projet, gestion des configurations et des changements, etc. Au total, sept domaines sont traits lorsqu'une entit passe au niveau de maturit 2, et quatorze au niveau 3.  ? Plusieurs cycles itratifs s'avrent ncessaires pour amliorer le processus ?,  relve Herv Lamachre, responsable qualit chez Steria France.    La normalisation des procdures est ici l'un des ma?tres mots. ? Le principal objectif d'une dmarche CMM consiste  avoir un processus de dveloppement commun  toute l'entit, dfini et document correctement ?, rsume Hubert Tardieu. De fait, les SSII ciblent en gnral le niveau 3 de maturit. A ce stade, chaque type de projet se voit pilot  l'identique selon un processus bien huil. Les adaptations ventuelles sont documentes.     Mais le plus intressant pour toi :   (...) Pour autant, le modle ne fournit pas de solutions prtes  l'emploi, seulement des recommandations. C'est  l'entreprise de dcider des outils et de la mthodologie de dveloppement  mettre en oeuvre pour satisfaire aux critres CMM.    La constitution d'un rfrentiel de pratiques para?t nanmoins un passage oblig. Il s'agit de mettre  plat et d'uniformiser les pratiques, tant au niveau des processus et des mthodes de dveloppement (UML, RUP en gnral) que de guides d'utilisation des outils (tests, gestion de configuration, planification de projet, dveloppement, etc.).  Les ingnieurs doivent donc tre forms  l'application des pratiques. Des postes transverses sont galement crs pour s'assurer de l'application des pratiques. Par exemple, des gestionnaires des configurations ou des  ? knowledge managers ?  chargs de vrifier la qualit de la documentation technique.

cb10f19a9711a3071bd7f4924b7191adaa	Tout dpend de ce que tu dsires faire.    Si c'est dans une simple logique d'pargne, c'est  oublier sauf si tu as un ancien PEL dont le taux est intressant.    Si c'est pour emprunter dans 4 ans, ?a peut valoir le coup, car les taux du PEL sont contractualis  l'ouverture de celui-ci. En ce moment les taux sont bas. Donc, certes, sur la phase d'pargne, cela ne te rapportera pas grand chose, mais sur la phase d'emprunt le taux sera connu  l'avance, quoi qu'il arrive.  Et les taux ont l'air d'tre bien partis pour entamer une jolie grimpette, comme ils ont fait aux USA en peu de temps.    Donc si tu ouvres ton PEL maintenant en faisant le pari que les taux vont augmenter d'ici 4 ans, ?a peut reprsenter une bonne opportunit  ce moment. Ca ne co?te pas grand chose que de l'ouvrir en regardant voluer la situation. Si les taux grimpent et que tu vois ce scnario se raliser, il sera toujours temps d'orienter ton pargne durant ces 4 ans sur ton PEL. Si les taux ne remontent pas trop, il suffira d'arbitrer sur autre chose. Ca ne co?te que 45 euros d'pargne mensuelle. Ce serait domage de se priver d'un tel instrument.|`|4bada3231315a7a8c5046fb364e60cbfaa	non les intrets sont faible avec un salaire faible, je ne crois pas au pel|`|39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	non, diversifies tes placements., le PEL est effectivement en perte de vitesse|`|f939a48a624200539ebd78a230c22e3daa	Tout depend de la date d ouverture du PEL    Si il est ancien le taux d interet peut etre interessant    Par contre ouvrir un PEL maintenant peut etre une facon interessante et peu couteuse de se premunir d une eventuelle hausse des taux d interet dans 3/4 ans (si tu desires realise un emprunt)|`|417b3d4346aec52ea8210dea39f2330eaa	le PEL est un produit de pre de famille qui rassure les banques quant  l'apport pour acheter et  l'habitude d'pargner.

I would write the contract in the first person because it involves only you and the landlord. The third person is usually used for general purposes and laws in general (like "one must acknowledge a renter's contract under certain time conditions based on section XYZ of the Landlord/Tenant Act in Never Never Land").|`|AA12073355	He is taking ur deposit anyway...don't bother....say bye to ur money dude|`|RNBqRHITaa	If you haven't pissed off the landlord in the past, giving 20 days notice instead of 30 will probably be acceptable to him.     Just ask him. If he agrees then simply have him sign a 1 page document which you would entitle "Waiver of 30-day Notice Requirement." Simply reference the lease document in this Waiver and state that both parties mutually agree to waive the 30-day notice requirement. Date the document and both you and the landlord should sign.     Then when you leave make sure you leave the place spotless and in very good condition otherwise you still will not get your deposit back in full.

fIz1Sxubaa	Any contract has to be a two way contract. Read your contract carefully, with the help of a lawyer freind, and then decide the future course of action.   Also, do not jump to the new offer without going thru the details.  Here is a nice story for you:      HELL  One day while walking down the street a highly successful Human Resources Manager was tragically hit by a bus and she died. Her soul arrived up inheaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.     "Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we've never once had a Human Resources Manager make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."    "No problem, just let me in," said the woman.     "Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're  going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."     "Actually, I think I've made up my mind, I prefer to stay in Heaven", said the woman.     "Sorry, we have rules..."     And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell.    The doors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were well dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old  times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.     She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kind of cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator.      The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her.     "Now it's time to spend a day in heaven," he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her.     "So, you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity,"     The woman paused for a second and then replied, "Well, I never thought I'd say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."     So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down-down-down back to Hell.     When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.     "I don't understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all myfriends look miserable."     The Devil looked at her smiled and told...     "Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you're an Employee"|`|js59qgDtaa	As per ministry of company affairs and labour law that type bond is not a valid one.

Upon experiencing those courses, reconsider your direction in life.     Basically, if you don't know what you want in life, you still have time to think it over.     You could always just be a professional student. Get a BA (or a BSci, if you wanted to) and just continue with grad school, being a Teacher's Aide to pay the bills.     You could be a teacher. Teaching takes all kinds of folks.     You could go take a language and become a translator. That takes a lot of creativity because you basically have to re-write a lot of the thing you are translating. It's easier than being a writer, because you don't have to come up with the ideas yourself.     In that vein, you could be a writer or a journalist or even a photo journalist.

AA12267166	Well, for one, make sure the windows and doors are sealing well. If you only use certain rooms during the day, close doors on the other rooms and close the heat venting in them until just before you go to bed. Window shades/curtains also help hold in heat. In the summer, covering the windows will keep out the unwanted heat so the AC doesn't have to work as hard to keep it cool.|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	Go round the house looking at appliances and seeing how they are rated, energy-wise. Or check the brochures that come with all electrical appliances.    E.g.  hair-dryer  =  1000 W = 1 kW    How you pay: you dry your hair for 12  minutes, which is 1/5 hour.     Multiply 1 kW x 1 h =  1 kWh.  (One kilowatt-hour)  This is the unit of energy usage.  The Electricity Board charges you by this unit. Let's say, you have to pay 20c per unit. Each time you use the hairdryer for 12 minutes, you pay 20c.   Six people per day using this to dry their hair = $1.20 per day. That adds up to $36 in a 30-day month.    Now you use a large water heater ( = 3 kW) for one hour so that everyone can get hot water to bathe, wash clothes, do dishes. This is 3 KW x 1 h  =  3 kWh per day.  [ 3 units x 20c x 30 days = $18 per month ]    Okay, airconditioners are the worst.  Say one 3 kW aircon is switched on the whole night in summer, and part of the day, for 10 hours.  [3 kW x 10 hours x $0.20 X 30 days  =  $180 per month !]    If you have a small 1.5 kW aircon, then it is still $90 per month. Use it for 5 hours a day, switching it on and off, say. Then it is $45 per month.     If every one of your 5 bedrooms have one fan-coil unit, then see how much this would be if you know the power rating for each unit. Ask your aircon dealer.    Then there are the other power guzzlers: the washing machine, the refrigerator, electric iron, standing fans, lights.    With energy saving lamps, each lamp adds very little to the electricity bill.   [ 0.007 kW x 24 h x $0.20 x 30 days =  $1.00 per month ]  Unfortunately, 30 lamps will add a lot.    I hope this helps. Just watch the aircons use.     Use shower baths and not soak to cut down water costs.|`|jMxfBts1aa	well u could cut back the usual stuff like toilet paper and stuff like that then u don't go through it as much so u won't run out and have to buy some more so fast
b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	No, I've never rented out a room in my home but other people have. This is called sub-letting.     This is quite commonly done. If you have a friend to share the home with, you can collect rent from the friend or let the friend live there for free. It's up to you.     Usually, you would ask permission for this to be done and it is up to the landlord to say go ahead and not mind, as long as you pay the rent in full.    But a lot of landlords do mind, especially if the other person is not a close friend of yours. Just an acquaintance who pays you his share of the rent. You see, if this person breaks a lamp, or a window or appliance, who is going to pay for the damage?     You're the one who has to do it because the contract is done between you and the landlord. If the other guy refuses to pay he can get off because he didn't sign anything with anybody.     What is usually done is that the landlord should sign another lease statement with the second person. Or you can amend your contract and scrawl a paragraph somewhere and get the other tenant, the landlord and yourself to sign the addendum.|`|AA10139972	yes

7b287d6fd710c2f97f6700acd6132e84aa	I have one question for you, is the Student Loan a Federal Student Loan or is it a Private Student Loan?  If this is a Federal Student Loan it concerns me that you would be considering consolidating your Student Loan debt with your other debt.    The reason I say this is if you were to consolidate your Federal Student Loans with the rest of your debt you would lose all the Federal Benefits that come with your Federal Student Loans.  Some of these benefits you would lose include your Federal Subsidies; this means the Federal Government would not pay your interest for you during qualified periods of Deferment.  A second benefit you would lose is the tax deductibility of your interest paid.  You would also lose your unlimited in school Deferment benefit.    For more information on consolidating your Federal Student Loans with your other debt please visit the source below.|`|G3vJ5eflaa	Nope not in the least, a couple points for the company you choose to run a credit check. Are you using a personal loan or consolidating through your house? Instead of consolidating you could use debt stacking.    Write all your debts, with interest, down. Start with the highest interest first. Put the names on the left, interest next, minimum payment and your actual payment. For all debts second and below, pay minimum payment. Whatever you had been payingextra on these, put that amount on top of the payment for number one highest interest. Keep paying that same amount until paid off, then roll that entire payment onto number two and so on until all is paid off. Do this if you are not about tolose your house or car. For anything else, consolidate all bills under your home.|`|15ec59839f6401c70ff82989b8c9c7adaa	Absolutely not.  Consolidating is a very good idea. Good Luck!  Budget  Credit Counseling ...|`|bcbb2ff96796632c0d1579fec373b731aa	It's normally a good idea. The goal being a lower monthly payment on the same amount of debt. If your new payment is lower than the combined total of what you are currently paying, go for it. If it's not, pass.    This should not hurt your credit score. Depending on your situation, it may or may not help your score. Factors include credit utilization, debt to income ratios and whether the new loan helps you pay on time.|`|tBoGedjSaa	Opt for a debt consolidation loan: The easiest method of getting a debt consolidation loan is to utilize the equity of your home. Equity of your home is calculated and determined by the difference in the amount you have paid and the amount you owe. If the amount you have paid is more than the amount due, you can use it as collateral. This allows you to borrow money on lower interest rates. Besides, you also get tax benefit on this type of loan. Consult your tax advisor before opting for this loan.

f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	I plan in advance.  I have a monthly budget and an annual budget.  I calculate my monthly spending based on two paychecks per month, but since I'm paid every other week, I actually get 26 paychecks per year.  I save the extra two checks for items like insurance and property taxes that I pay annually or quarterly.    The obviously cannot plan ahead for specific unexpected expenses, but I have savings that are more than adequate to cover things like that.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	A year in advance, good god no.

If you want to achieve more or change your life you will need to decide what you want and then decide/plan a course of action which will enable you to make progress towards your chosen goal. Then you focus on the future and set you sights on your goal and never falter or look back until you achieve the desired result.  Good luck
dPLkNRNuaa	In most cases: insurance follows the car- not the driver.    That means - if you loan out your car. The driver has an accident while driving your car and he is at fault. YOUR insurance pays for the damage. If your policy is not sufficient to cover all the damage then the drivers policy comes in on an excess basis. (that means it picks up where yours ran out).     If a law suit is filed as the result of an accident. It will name you (as the owner of the car) and the driver (as the operator).    Moral of the story- be careful who you loan your car to.|`|AA11173563	the insurance follows the car|`|dPULl5hjaa	YES - DON'T loan the car to anyone!|`|VaQuqsviaa	YES depending on insurance stataus|`|ee12f86390071e6ed1ca21eb76bf203faa	yes depending on yere insurance companies
nZFqq12Zaa	This is what I just read:    No. And here's why.    Your rebate is a one-time tax cut - an advance on a credit you'll receive on your 2008 return.    It's based on your 2007 income initially. If it turns out that your 2008 income and number of children would have qualified you for a larger rebate than the one you received, you'll be sent the difference. If it turns out your 2008 income was lower than in 2007 and you should have gotten a lower rebate, you get to keep the difference.    SO....Does this mean that whatever we are supposed to get back as a tax refund, they will subtract the stimulus check. Like, say I'm supposed to get back 5,000, but our stimulus check in 08 was for 1,800, does this mean instead of getting my 5,000 back, I'll only get 3,200 back as my tax refund????|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	no, they ask you if you got it, if not they want to figure the credit.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	NO,but if you qualify for more based on your 2008 tax return you'll get the difference in your refund,not in a seperate check.please be sure to file your return correctly as far as the recovery rebate credit is concerned because if you put the wrong amount received your refund will probaly be delayed,like a lot of folks refunds has been already.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	No, it shouldn't. Consider the stimulus check a gift from Uncle Sam.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	No, but if you received less than what you should have received, they will give the difference to you.|`|qWaYbxcxaa	The 2008 stimulus check is not a tax deduction.|`|TYdb5kuFaa	Mine did.  My refund was delayed by a week (original DD was 1/30...got pushed back to 2/6) and today the IRS posted on the WMR that the amount was reduced by 900.00 because that is how much of a Rebate check we received.   So, yes they did subtract it from my refund.|`|ximb5bCxaa	NO.....you just get it if you didn't last year and you qualify this year.

I worked in a small baseball shop once where most of the customers were part of a baseball team, and the same people came through every day. One time someones card was declined. The guy was shocked at first, but the next day he told me that at the same time he was trying to buy his stuff, someone was trying to make a $10,000 purchase with his card number. Fortunately the guy got it all sorted out, but in the meantime it denied his card for his real purchase.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	When you purchase something using a card - the funds are transferred electronically. This is all organised along lines (between your bank and a switch and the merchant and the switch) The switch is where things get organised, like what bank this transaction is coming from and who the merchant is.   Sometimes these lines can be down - also sometimes the switch can be down.   But if your card doesn't work after a few hours, call back the bank and ask to speak to the fraud dept and see if they have put a stop on your card as there may have been a suspicious transaction identified, and your card stopped.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	If you have made other purchases recently with your debit card, there may be outstanding holds on the card that have yet to be lifted.      For example, when you swipe your debit card to buy gasoline a larger amount is 'held' until the actual charge is cleared.  Due to bank delays, the money is released from the merchant right away, but can take up to three days for your bank to remove it.|`|e635a93a50a433f7c9fbd031cd4d512baa	check the expiry date and your security number

J5aw0ubpaa	I dont think so,my refund was 9758 and im set for direct deposit tonight at midnight,my sisters refund is for 12k and she filed after me hers is set for the 13th deposit,so I really dont think that they are being biased for people with high refunds.I think that everyone is/was having problems with them switching up the dates and late refunds.Calling will not delay it ,its just what that they dont know anything over there at the irs.Unless they ask you to produce some documents pertaining to your refund or send you a letter in the mail then it is on its way......I promise,they are just slow this year|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Calling will do absolutely nothing to speed up your refund.  You need to change your withholding to avoid that much excess.|`|6oC6k6hQaa	You are not the only one with a held up refund.  Virtually everyone here has a delayed refund.  You are not the only angry one with a hungry family.  Mine was delayed as well and mine is certainly not 13K nor is it even close to 11K.  If you really get that much back every year and your family is that hungry, maybe you need to change your withholdings to have less taken out of your paycheck every pay and use that extra paycheck money to get groceries.  And calling is not going to make it any better, that is only holding up the employees who are working to process your returns and get your refunds processed.|`|SdTQVUaKaa	You won't get a straight answer, calling 20x a day or not. My refund is less than 10k but it's held up. Changed 4x now.
snh9wzpnaa	If you filed after 10:00 am on 1/29, you missed the cutoff for the IRS money dumps on the 2/6, so they will dump yours on 2/13 and your bank will finally admit having it on either 2/16 or 2/17.

raqQPkwyaa	I think your last paragraph should give you the answer. This is why you have to research any opportunity very carefully. Whenever I see marketers telling how they make 2500.00/wk or more per month and how easy it is I get a chuckle. If it was that easy wouldn't we all be swimming in cash? There really is no such thing as "get rich quick" unless you hit the megabucks jackpot. Blogs are too much work as far as keeping the content fresh and old blogs are old news so who cares about the archives. The best opportunity is one that you create. You can create your own work from home business by building a niche website with keyword focused content pages. People do this everyday by building websites about a passion or hobby and then adding affiliate sales, google ads, and other forms of passive income . It all boils down to multiple streams of income. But first you have to identify what your site will be about and have a blue print to follow. Once you know the process you will get free targeted traffic through the search engines. The internet is about information, information, information. Deliver free useful information, warm up your visitors to your monetization model, presell them by being unbiased and then you will make sales and money. This is a process so don't expect to get rich quick. In time with some brains and motivation you will own a nice little corner of the internet and have more freedom to do the things you love. For starters it will require work for little or no pay. The payday will come in time with patience and keyword focused content pages on your site. First you need to find a good site builder that is wysiwyg. Unless you are good at HTML, etc. When looking for a site builder be sure to research it as well. What kind of support system do they have? What tools are available and do they cost extra money to have the tools etc.? Next you will brainstorm a site blue print. A good site builder will have this tool available. The blue print will basically be profitable keywords for your pages that are non generic. Profitable keywords are ones that are high in demand and low in supply. Then you build keyword focused content pages about your sites theme. Giving away free information. The beginning is all about building credibility and visitors. Your keyword focused content pages will get you free targeted traffic through the search engines. Once your site is building in size you can start to presell your monetization model and finally monetize. There really is no such thing as get rich quick so be patient and focused.

OOkNg0IIaa	Yes paid surveys are real, but the problem is that there are far more sites "posing" as surveys out there than there are real ones. I first started doing surveys about 5 years ago. I signed up with over 300 sites (today I am with well over 600 sites) and now, I regularly get paid by about 50 of them.    My first month I made a whopping $5. The next few months were more of the same. But I stuck with it and was patient. Today, again 5 years later, I regularly make at least $600 on paid surveys.    Here are the key things to remember.    1. There are no guarantees with surveys. It's all about your demographics. Sometimes they will want teens, other times they will want working moms, other time they will want physicians.    2. You really need to be with the biggest group of legit sites you can find. The more sites you are with, the more likely that you will actually match up your demographics with surveys and get paid.    3. Don't ever pay for a list. Period. All of the same information is out there for free.    4. Be patient. If it works for you, it won't work instantly. I can't tell you how many people have contacted me saying "I am giving up after a month." Well, like I said, if I did that I would have stopped making $5.    But the upside to surveys is that there is no risk. You don't spend any money and if you try it and like it, great. And if you don't you walk away. If you want to check out my blog where I track the survey sites that have actually paid me, feel free to visit http://www.thesurveystar.blogspot.com    Good luck!|`|itIPaCG0aa	My friend knows the owners of this site.

2N6oTOLQaa	I'm not sure about the laws in Scotland, but in the US banks are allowed to set their own policies on this topic. Most banks will say if you are overdrawn at any one moment you get charged a fee, even if you deposit money later in the same day. Banks do this because they like collecting fees.

Toda experincia, quando n?o se tem nenhuma,  vlida para desenvolver-se e come?ar a p?r o pzinho no mercado de trabalho.

Mas tem que persistir e estar pronto para as oportunidades quando elas chegam. V s agncias de estgios de sua cidade, comunique os amigos, os vizinhos, que voc est  procura de trabalho e n?o tenha vergonha de correr atrs.

c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Em 1964, quando o regime militar assumiu o poder com um golpe de Estado, a proposta era de estabilizar a economia brasileira, debelar a infla??o e iniciar um novo ciclo de expans?o do setor eltrico. Dessa forma, foi organizada uma estrutura de investimentos com recursos das prprias empresas, do governo e com financiamentos externos. A Eletrobras, embora constituda em 1962, apenas a partir da dcada de 70 assumiu posi??o ativa no setor eltrico nacional. A partir da, a postura e atua??o da estatal foram decisivas para a consolida??o da nova estrutura produtiva e financeira do setor de energia eltrica.     A poltica energtica da Eletrobras foi pautada por quatro itens: prioridade atribuda  op??o hidreltrica, em oposi??o  termoeltrica; estratgia de construir grandes usinas geradoras de alcance regional em termos de mercado consumidor; constituir-se em holding estatal e elaborar um padr?o de financiamento do setor eltrico nacional, conjugando recursos de diferentes fontes: tarifria, impostos, emprstimos compulsrios e emprstimos do sistema financeiro internacional.     Aliado a isso, no decorrer da dcada de 70, ocorreram mudan?as significativas no setor eltrico e nas atividades de planejamento energtico em todo o mundo, entre elas o choque mundial do petrleo, em 1973. Algumas dessas transforma??es tiveram reflexo direto no Brasil.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Your true income is only what you can make in commissions. If you get $400 per car sale, you would make $1,600 that month.  To help you pay your bills, they give you an "advance" or "draw" of $1,600.  You don't get to keep any more money from your commissions until you have made $1,601. Until that time you are living on your "draw".  It is best to refuse the draw. Even tho you need money. They always fire the guys with "draws" first. They won't fire you if you are only on commission because it doesn't cost them a penny to keep you..|`|AA10405438	A draw is money taken from future earnings.  You are paid $400.00 a week.

eca6e84f8c585231830041fd53f65d6daa	You can definitely go back and file from 2006 to 2008. Just make sure you go to the IRS website, I'm sure there is a form for those cases.
AA10921553	If you son lives with you over six months out of the year, then it is against the law for  him to claim your son for EIC. Even if the divorce decree says he can claim your son, all that means is he can claim him for dependency and child tax credit. You get to claim him for EIC, if you qualify. You can also claim HOH status if you qualify. If your decree specifically states he can only claim the child if he's caught up on support, paper file your taxes with proof he's behind and include your son on your taxes for EIC, dependency, and child tax credit. They will send you both a letter. He will have to prove your son lived with him for more than six months out of the year. Things he will have to come up with would be school records, dr. records showing he and your son's address were the same. If he cannot produce that info but you can for yourself...then you get to claim your child, you got his money for back support, he will have to pay back the IRS, and he will have to file every year for atleast five that he frauded the IRS out of EIC. It has severe reprecussions when you screw the IRS on EIC.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	By what authority does he take the exemption for your son?  Is it decreed in the divorce agreement?

M2WniUdzaa	You can deduct the sales tax that you paid during the year, but only if you itemize your deductions.

Of course you have to have enough other deductions like  medical, mortgage interest, real estate tax and charitable contributions to make it worth your while to take the itemized deduction over the standard.

Get yourself something creative and snappy.  What type of business are you?|`|iES3MIPcaa	nope|`|DhUMjZxtaa	not unless you want a lawsuit on your a$$|`|oCMrcnu0aa	No.  When you say 'company' you are talking about a legal entity, with its own legal existence independently of its owners and registered at Companies House.  No two registered names can be identical.    If you are not talking a company but, maybe a partnership or a sole trader, it can have the same name unless someone takes legal action to prevent you using the same name.  There are various reasons why they might do that but perhaps you can ask a specific question if that is relevant.|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Yes it can, as long as you don't trade in the same industry.    You could open an indian restaurant called 'currys' if you wanted to (as long as you don't use the same font as the big currys)  But you couldn't open up a small phone/electrical shop and call it 'currys' as that would be direct infringement.    )) To be honest this really won't be a problem for you. If somebody does get annoyed all that will happen is that you will be requested to change your name, and at that point it's upto you if you change it (relatively cheap) or if you decide to fight the matter in court (relatively expensive).    But to be honest, the chances that someone is going to get annoyed be a one man band in a city in the UK is like 0.0000001%      Name it what you want and deal with the problem if someone objects.    You can't have the same company name as someone else. But you can have the same trading name.

What does the terms of service say? Do you have to make x   of calls a day or do you have to purchase and use their product? If it is done on line through an opportunity you are limited. Basically you have to use their website and follow their rules. On the other hand you could create your own work from home business and set your own rules. This is done by building a theme based website about something that you are passionate about or have knowledge of. By doing this you can have multiple streams of income through affiliates, e-books, referrals, ad sense, etc. It is all about information and building keyword focused content pages about your theme which gets you free targeted traffic through the search engines. Google and yahoo love niche websites. The trick is to find out how to do this with a good site builder that gives you the tools needed to build a profitable on line business. If they promise get rich quick....run. You will not get rich quick. You will build a solid business that , in time, will make you money. Think about what you are passionate about.

AA10144492	Unfortunately, the answer to your question is going to be determined by details. Because each case is taken on its own merits, there's no one answer that is correct for every situation.    I'd suggest taking your question to a trademark search company or a trademark attorney so you can get specific advice.    To register a trademark, that's done either through your Secretary of State for a State trademark or the US Patent & Trademark Office for a Federal trademark.     If you are only conducting business in one state, then a State trademark is most appropriate. If you conduct (OR are planning to conduct) business in at least 2 states OR between the US & any other country, you can file for a Federal trademark.    Prior to investing your time, money & effort into a name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available.     This entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark.     Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!

e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Usually the kids' guardian is given control of the money, if you haven't made any other arrangements.     Me, I've made other arrangments.   My life insurance will go to fund a TRUST, I've named the trustees - who are NOT the guardians of my kids.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	A trustee would have to be appointed before the insurance company would release the benefit payment.  Normally, that trustee would probably be the child's guardian.|`|BovpXrk1aa	set up a trust|`|2sXqm4u9aa	You need a will, both of you, naming an exeutor of your estate, a trustee of any monies, etc., that goes to your minor children then you need to name a Guardian of your minor children.  The trustee of the estate controls the life insurance monies,  and in most states has to make an annual accounting to the court of what is spent on behalf of your children.  The guardian and trustee can be the same person like one of your parents, brothers or sisters aunts or uncles.|`|AA11064536	You REALLY need to discuss this with an attorney.    The following is my understanding and NOT legal advice.    If you and your wife both die in an accident, the life insurance money (let's say you have $500,000 on BOTH yourself and your wife), then $1 million goes to your kids.  Since they are under 18, they cannot handle that amount of money.  The Probate court that handles your estate would appoint a guardian of your children probably a family member bu not necessarily (perhaps someone that you don't want raising your kids) AND give that person (or perhaps yet another person) in charge of your insurance money with light oversight from the court.  That person then could take the money and buy a brand new Lexus every year because "that person needs a reliable vehicle to transport your kids."  This and worse happens every day.    What happens if you die but not your wife.  She collects $500,000.  Later, she remarries, then she dies.  Someone else is raising your kids with your money and you had no say in the matter.  Your wife's second husband, a widower, can spend your money as he wants to and may neglect your kids and NOT send them to college.    Wouldn't it be better if you NAME a guardian (and a backup guardian) and provided specific guidance on how you want your money spent?  You could easily do this but it requires several legal documents and thus you need an attorney.    Good Luck.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	Contrary to the above answers a Will is not needed if the beneficiaries are set up properly.  What you need to do is appoint a trustee.  This would be done through your insurance agent.  A trustee will make financial decisions if need be until the kids are old enough to make them responsibly themselves (you decide how old they have to be before they get the money).  If the beneficiaries are set up correctly the money never even touches your estate, so a Will isn't needed for anything.    Also, a Will is not a good thing if we are talking about a large amount of money.  2 reasons:  A Will is public knowledge and is contestable in court.  Any Joe Blow can read about your death in the paper, find out about the Will reading and show up and say "Whoa, Whoa Whoa!  I was friends with them and they told me that they wanted me to have half of their estate when they died!"  then it would go to court and battle it out.  Most of these cases end up settling out of court to make the person get lost so the family can greive and move on.  That out of court settlement money and legal fees could be going to your kids, rather than some scamming chump and a lawyer.  If it's a big amount of money we're talking about set up a family trust and make sure the beneficiaries are done correctly.  Neither a family trust or beneficiaries are contestable in court (check with your local state and provincial laws to make sure you don't live in a loophole place though).

AA10167044	Call the lender and try to negotiate some different terms.  That's what the TARP money and bailouts are supposed to be for.  They don't want to reposses an RV, believe me.

First, you need to read your agreement, this is standard in most HP agreements. Usually this kicks in after you have paid 50%.    If you do return the car then, the finance co will send someone from an auction house to check your car, make sure it is clean and take a lot of pictures because, sometimes they will try to bill you for damage or wear.    Good Luck.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	You may not like the answer, but you best way out is to sell it, coming up with whatever cash shortfall you need to pay off your loan.|`|AA12206708	If you don't continue to pay the loan AND they report to the credit bureaus, it's going to affect your credit no matter what.  You can't truly have it both ways.    However, your main concern is trying to make the best of a bad situation.  One of the answerers above has the right idea.  And it's an idea that Dave Ramsey gives quite often.  Sell the vehicle/RV and make a deal with the lender about paying off any deficiency.  Main thing is to call the lender and let them know what your situation is.    There is another option, too.  Perhaps you can list the RV and lease it to someone or rent it out.  At least if they are making payments to you for rent/lease, you might be able to handle the difference.  Or if you bring someone credit worthy to the lender, they might be willing to let someone else take over the payments.  (Not the easiest to do but still possible).    Good luck, but in any event, don't just quit making payments without making some effort to resolve your issue.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	The only option that you have is to find someone to buy your RV and then pay off the remaining amount.

dC6A5R5Saa	Bad move.  Japan has a currency rate of 0.10%.  If you short JPY against another currency and that country/region drops their interest rate to stimulate their economy in a recession, JPY will go up.  The same will happen if Japan increases its rate.    Regarding the five majors:  USD: 0.25%  JPY: 0.10%  EUR: 2.00%  CHF: 0.50%  GBP: 1.50%    You definitely would be at risk with the cross rates.  I wouldn't be surprised if the UK make a rate cut.  The swiss franc is no good even with a 0.50% rate because it moves similar to the Euro and the European union has room for rate cuts.    Your only option for shortening the JPY is against the USD.  With America wanting to improve employment and the housing market, I think the FOMC will leave the US rate at 0.25 for most of or all of 2009, but even then you've got to hope that Japan doesn't raise their interest rate.    I'm more knowledgeable about the stock market, but I have traded the FX spot market before.  If I was trading it now, I would be shorting the Pound against the USD.  UK is in a recession and have more room for interest rate cuts.  The US and Japan doesn't.|`|AA10167044	I agree with you, but remember currencies trade against each other.

K5pUbkbkaa	Work on a freeware or small business project part-time, pro-bono if need be. Google around for forums relating to this sort of thing; programming is a broad field, and without knowing your areas of interest I can't specifically recommend particular web communities. Anyway, look on forums for "indie" software firms looking for coders and offer your services. This will help bolster your resume and, thus, your industry prospects.    This is, of course, assuming you have some sort of degree or qualification in software development. I do understand that programming ability and programming qualifications are not codependent, but it does look better to prospective employers if you have studied the subject. Not only does it "prove" you have the requisite skills developed to a necessary level, it also demonstrates the ability to work to deadlines and within guidelines, as you would have to do during your coursework.

They usually have a section for you to write your explanations.    It sounds to me like you need to sit down in a meeting with your manager and the HR person and discuss policy, the reasons for the delay and what could have been done differently.    They might give you all kinds of ideas on how to speed up the process or how to get timelier feedback from clients or if you can turn in preliminary reports when you don't have all of the information.    If you are truly working up to speed then these issues are usually just a question of communication.

C233ATPvaa	Shrink is simply "loss" everyone knows the importance there.     Margin control is simply balancing level of profits. Profit maxization is the fundamental objective. Keep it high for personal profit but not to high to balance volume of customers.     Remember the formula,   TR= P*Q    TR Total Revenue  P Price   Q Quantity sold    P and Q are tradeoffs.|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	"Shrinkage" is a polite term for theft.  If a retailer pays for merchandise that is then stolen by customers or employees, not only does he lose the money paid for the merchandise, but he loses the opportunity to make a profit on that money invested.  He has to spend more money to replace the lost merchandise, plus time and productivity are lost.  "Margin control" is a polite term for profit.  Selling price minus cost of goods, minus inbound freight, minus overhead costs (rent/mortgage, utilities, salaries, taxes, benefits, cost of marketing, etc.,) equals profit.  Lowering the price of something does NOT lower any of the fixed costs listed above.  Lowering the price means the deduction comes totally from the profit.  Therefore, maintaining one's margin or controlling the margin means protecting the profit.    There are many ways of controlling the margin.    --not over-buying merchandise,  --not buying merchandise the customers don't want,  --not buying merchandise out of season (September is a bad month to receive a large shipment of beach towels for instance,)  --having quick ship vendors for merchandise that does sell or turn quickly,  --effective marketing  (includes advertising and display,)  --carefully training sales people to help clients select add-on purchases and to watch for and deal with attempted theft, and so on.
AA12349988	Unless your mortgage is close to 400,000 this is shocking advice from your bank and i would tell them to swivel.     WIthout knowing how much your mortgage is I cant work out the exact figures but assuming your mortgage is the average (150,000) in the UK a 1% drop in interest rates would save you approx 150 a month.      Here are the two things you need to considers     1.  Your mortgage expires in 19 months time so that 7,000 is the equivalent to 369.42 each month    2. But you will be adding 7,000 to your loan so you will be paying interest on that 7,000 for the remainder of your mortgage.      Unless you are in a desperate place I would stick with what you have and look around in Aug 2010.|`|93f5bc2f17989cfb856983126c1aa33caa	This is only my opinion; but it is likely that the BoE base rate will stay at 1% for a year and then take approximately 5 years to rise to 5%.  The best deals available now are tracker mortgages which are 2-2.5% above base rate, ( meaning 3-3.5%) which also include an additional charge of around 1300.  You have to weigh up the difference between 6.19% and 3.5% for 18 months, plus the 7000 penalty and the 1300 set up fee.

ItLN7fCBaa	Ouch! I see your point. You mean they wrote it off as a bad debt. But I get it. In reality they probably wouldn't get the connection. It is just too hard to merge one system with the other. And just so that you have it straight, JP Morgan Chase is acquiring WAMU (Washington Mutual, formerly Provodian) not the reverse. WAMU screwed up. When they bought Providian they dried up their liquidable assets and that was that. They are a bunch of idiots anyway.     Back to your point; you'll notice a couple of things with regards to their new terms agreement with you. The main thing is their inability to merge records completely. JP Morgan Chase is trying to shove their "information sharing" clause upon anyone and everyone with WAMU. So here come the robocallers. If you read it, they offer no choice of privacy whatsoever. That's not right. I already wrote the OCC and the BBB about that. I also mentioned to the OCC and the BBB that JP Morgan Chase failed to send us an opt-out cluase. That is flagrantly against the law. Add that to the fact that they are attempting to jack up every card-holders rates 1.5% across the board, and well you know what you need to do. You need to close that piece of trash account with them. They are amoung the worst and trying to be the extreme worst.    In order to opt out, write WAMU at:  Reference CH  P.O. Box 99606  Arlington, TX  76096-9606    Include your name, address and account number. Send it with mail tracking of some sort. Sign that document. Do this well before the March 6th deadline. Today comes to mind.    And do feel welcome to drop a line to the OCC here: http://www.occ.gov    It is obvious that they lost their shirts on the mortgage mess that they created and are trying to make you and I pay for it with increased interest rates. We need all complain. Be sure and mention that JP Morgan Chase failed to offer an opt-out option (if that is the case for you as it was for me). These slimebags are all in a hurry to change their rules while they have a chance. The focus is not on them now. But it soon will be. They bully us by making us think that without the credit, our FICO's will go down. Poop on them. Try getting a better credit card. At a time when they are getting bailout money for free and borrowing at 0.0%, how is it that Jp Morgan Chase wnats to try and charge us the highest interest rates in history?    Go to www.fatwallet.com and check around for a more competitive rate on a CC that makes more sense.     If you are afraid that you will not qualify for anything else, then call WAMU now and DEMAND a better interest rate. Insist upon speaking with a Supervisor. The Supervisors are the ones that do not have the Philipino accents. Sometimes they try and pass it to their co-worker and say here is my supervisor. Don't fall for it. They are all idiots until you get to the Texas people. Then get that better rate. That works about half of the time.    Good luck.|`|FB5IjcHeaa	I would because Chase is really a dirty company from my point of view.Just to be on the safe side move the account.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Well, I am with wamu and chase sends out promos sometimes a cash benefit for changing, I asked the chase mgr are they still going to be doing that and she said if another promo comes bring it in and the bank will start my new account. They are not mixing account numbers. I doubt they would take the money, they have no court order giving them permission. It would be theft if they took the money, but then again until you pay chase back youve stolen their money.   I wouldnt worry, but I would start paying.

Most of them want you to give them a lot of upfront money, for which you'll never see a dime in return. I do work from home, but I did A LOT of research first. I was a banker for many years, and was not happy. The trip back and forth to work, bosses, pay, you name it. So, I started researching work from home ideas that I could use my skill with. I settled on Canyon as an Equipment Leasing Broker. Basically, I bring together people who want to lease equipment with those that want to lend money. Now, I am happier than ever, making more money than I ever imagined, and I do it from the comfort of my home. As I said, figure out what you are good at, do your research and take the plunge !

All these get rich quick schemes you might see are exactly that, schemes. The only thing I might be able to suggest is to drive around neighborhoods and look for some people that might need some handyman work or new concrete on their driveways or walkways. See if you can get a little extra work doing that. Try making little flyers and posting them up on bulletin boards wherever you can, you know, with the little strips cut at the bottom with your phone number on them.

If you don't want to wait for that, at least get a couple more specific rate quotes and see if you can beat that 5.3% still.

d4bb87a1bf726fdec807a65a476fa036aa	Managing might be hard right off the bat because you don't have much experience. An MBA might help if you consider more schooling. You can even go part-time.    When you say you don't want to go into the financial sector, what does that mean? Does that mean you don't want to work for a bank or mutual fund company?  Are you excluding jobs like Budget Analyst, which can be found in every company?    I too would like to start out as a big-wig, starting or managing a company.  But it looks like without actually developing a product yourself, you're going to be stuck starting at the bottom, and working your way up the ladder. Office politics play a part in the matter.    I've been given the advice "Just try different things".  Of course, I can't even find *a* job, let alone be able to pick from a selection. If you don't like your current job, apply for another one. Something that sounds interesting and different. It doesn't matter whether you think you will want to do it for the rest of your life or not, because you won't.  But maybe you'll find key aspects of the job you like and don't like, and can narrow your job search from there.    I guess it sounds like wasting time, but you could be sitting there without a job like countless others. You're building your resume just by working and interacting with people in a company. Also, companies love seeing continuous employment in a company, because they don't want to hire and train you if you're going to find another job in a year.    Or, consider saving up your money and starting a business. Perhaps you have a hobby that you could somehow turn into a profitable venture.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	My boss is a chemist - she loves her job, works with customers and yet runs her own business.

But again it really comes down to where your true passion lies, and what you's like more. I think considering it would be a BA in engineering, its not your typical BA of arts/science degree.

(Sale minus purchase amount with indeation is your gain).|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	Tax on short term capital gains from the sales of shares where you paid security transaction tax is 10% (for AY 2008-09) and 15% (for AY 2009-10) while there is no tax on long term capital gains.

Computation of Long-term Capital Gain  1. Take the full value of consideration (full sale price without any deductions),  2.

In your Q you say flat held for more than 3 years, while in add details you say you have not received possession yet.    You can claim exemption on interest paid so far, during construction, one fifth every year for 5 years. But you have to hold the property for 5 years.    Figures provided by you are all incorrect. Also you have to mention month and year of purchase/sale for calculating indexed cost.
CiMaltLBaa	I think that if you are going to study really hard for this course, and you really believe that this is a course for you, I would go for it, the only person who holds us back is ourselves!  I would recommend seeing a university or college adviser, to see where you have to go, make goals and plan ahead for the time it takes to finish the course!    Whatever you decide for your future: Good Luck!

OWTV4q0haa	well in Canada it would have to be the crazy plans that are offered.Other countries around the world such as Japan and even India have really good data & voice plans.Along with the the prices of plans is the fact that most people would rather avoid buying a new phone when theirs can last another year or 2 the second part can be blamed due to the fact that the world is in a bit of an economic situation

K5pUbkbkaa	Depends if you mean "job" or "company"; normally it's merely circumstancial.    I once worked for a company where a packer in the stores department ended up as the manager of the Spare Parts department, netting a pay rise of $10,000 in the process. In this same company, a complete incompetent became the Materials Manager and held on to this position for a very long time, despite dragging the company from one calamity to the next.    If you're not satisfied, seek other employment.
JUeQIz02aa	Hi,    Yes it becomes statute barred.|`|yGd8Jrljaa	no statue of limitations applies once your account becomes delinquent & becomes charge off. Ask your Creditor the charge off date on your account and then calculate the statue of limitation period.    Statue of limitation period is different in different states|`|oFiGyMWraa	In the UK the Limitation Act periods start from the date that there was first a cause of action. In a contract this will be 6 years from the date the contract was breached, not when it was signed.    For loan agreements or credit cards the 6 years will start when the debt was last acknowledged. This will be the last date that a payment was made, or when there was some communication or negotiation regarding the debt.
0191j9waaa	Study and Job, Both!    you have to study well, this will make sure you are going to get a better job in future!  i know that it will cost you for time being, but i thin you can do some part time work to cover the cost!    Be patient! you have to look further! you could suffer a little ( maybe 2- 4 years ) bit during your study, but you are going to have a better or luxry life during lifetime after you study well !  good luck!

Employers always prefer recruits who are currently in employment because they have recent references for them and they know they are up to date with what is going on in the employment world. Just ask anyone who has been out of the workplace for a while and they will tell you how hard it is to get back into work.     2) Your self-esteem. It is not nice being out of work. I was unemployed for six months once and it is horrible. It doesn't matter how dreary your job is it still gives you some status which being on benefits won't. And you have to have a lot of self-discipline to not let yourself stagnate at home.     It is not a great time to change jobs at the moment, but could you not plan for the future? Is there nothing you could do to help yourself get a better paying job in the future. Perhaps get a qualification. You may be able to get a free or subsidised course via a local college or learndirect. Or perhaps you could do some voluntary work to get some more skills on your CV.|`|9O6uEGPoaa	happiness and more money!    would you still be able to do the things you want to?    you should read up on making money of the internet!    well easy!|`|AA11602427	You pose a tough question.

I know it's hard - and it's difficult to make yourself do it considering there's an easier way out. It's your call. You have to do what you think is right and what is best for you. Good luck to you. I hope you find a higher paying job soon - one that make you want to get out of bed and go.|`|fCgfReMiaa	i can see you point. i lost my job recently and have had to sign on. i have to be honest though even with having a low income in my last job and most my pay going on rent and bills it was still better than living off 40 a week and having to pay for food and bills out of that. i cant wait to get back into work again and im really praying i get a job soon. ive got an interview next week its only part time but its something so ive got my fingers and toes crossed. Also i dont know if youve tried applying for housing benefit? you might still be able to get some if your on a low income and you should also try applying for working tax credits.|`|71bfa9e8a0801404218150bc79e0d806aa	this is just another case of  businesses putting strain on the welfare state and claiming benefits through the back door, they know that by paying  crap wages the government will be forced to pay the tab (ie working tax credits) whilst the company makes billions per year safe in the knowledge that the government will pay to make up the wages   nowadays more and more stigma is attached to benefit claimants but none is attached to the big profit company's that force workers to claim benefits just to survive on such low wages|`|LoKJBLF1aa	Lets face it, 90%of jobs are totally pointless.What is important is your TIME.If you are almost as well off not working your poxy job, then leave it.If you have any ideas to go into business for yourself, then this is the time to get things started.Be your own boss, and have at least some control over your destiny.good luck.
811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	I can't help you with the big problem - that is for you to sort out.  However there is something the other posters have missed.  You said about a debt for an address where your ex had moved to after you split.  You need to be sure that he did not 'take over' your accounts and use them for his benefit, knowing they would come to you for payment.  Clear that side of things up sharpish.  You need to state what dates you lived at those addresses, contact Experian and ask how you amend the addresses.   Then take a deep breath and look at what's left.     I don't know how you play it, but I only ever send the payments back to the company the original debt was with.  I don't trust these debt collection firms - they take a slice.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	In the UK, any debt over six years old is void. You do not have to pay for those, despite how they threaten you.

Visit the website www.bdebtfree.info and they will help you sort this out. They will arrange to deal with all correspondence with your lenders so your partner need not see letters. The law in the UK is on your side.|`|9qymF2xlaa	If you acknowledge a debt (i.e phone the debt collecting agency) it will be ANOTHER 6 years to wait til it goes statute !  You are best to ignore them and not reply. Just, make sure you change your bank account. Get a basic one that doesnt require a credit check, then they will have very little chance of catching up with you. The only way a debt can be written off is if you have a disability. You should give debtline a phone, they are very good at dealing with these sort of things. They can send you out scripts to send to the companies, making token payments of 50p a week cause you have so many other commitments. If a collection agent comes to your door, remember that they are nothing special. They have no powers and you are entitled to slam the door in their face and laugh whilst doing so !!  Good luck                    Re: will someone turn up at your door.  They could, but there's not a lot they can do to be honest! (unless they have a warrant of sale or summit)  They take different action for different things. Things like utilities (gas, electricity, community charge) have severe legal consequences, whereas things you have on HP or credit are less severe (catalogues, tv's etc)    You could work out a payment plan, and pay them at a ten quid a week. It's your choice.. don't let their red letters get to you though. They are worded to sound threatening|`|2Hmtwgpaaa	File for bankruptcy.All depts are written off,if good enough for kerry katona.what have you got to lose.|`|GOQLgPd4aa	i would hang fire. your old debts have probably already been written off.in future though make sure you only buy what you can afford and be honest with your new partner so that if your old debts do catch up with you he doesn't feel like an idiot & stop running!|`|BIC8Bc7Taa	Hi, poor you I know what you are going through and the best advice that I can give you (having done this myself) is to go to the CAB, they usually have someone that deals with debts etc and they will be able to explain the legalities of it all and put your mind at rest.  I did this and their reassurance helped me a lot.  Just be really honest with them about all of your debts and don't worry about feeling ashamed, silly etc.  I felt like this and they really put my mind at ease..  I wish you peace of mind and know that you will feel better after talking with someone who can offer you help and noone need know about it.  I wont tell you what action I decided on as each case is individual.  All the best to you and I wish you  well with your new life, you are a strong person (having walked away from pain) and this is the last thing that you have to do to put the past firmly in the past.  take care. x
OvqBVdizaa	If your parents put you on their taxes that means they ARE getting "credit" for you.  They may not get child tax credit on you, but they do get an exemption credit for you.    You don't need to file taxes if all you made is $1000 (and you were paid on a W-2)    However, if you had any federal taxes withheld (look at your W-2, box 2) go ahead and file.  You can get that money back as a refund.  Just make sure you indicate that you are being claimed on someone else's (your parents) return.    Andrea, TurboTax QA Analyst
AA11284831	No, it is NOT deducted from any refund you are due this year.

298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	It primarily is the economic situation. Across all industries, people are being laid off. Some people are taking salary or wage cuts and others are just watching their spending. In large part, people are avoiding unnecessary purchases. Although clothing isn't completely unnecessary, most clothes shopping that people is discretionary. Most of the population are trying to find ways to cut back. If they go clothes shopping at all, they're going to thrift stores, like Goodwill. Goodwill has actually reported an increase in revenue since the recession began. With people spending less of whatever discretionary income that they have left, large retail and department stores are taking a hit, people just aren't going to these places to do their shopping. Macy's and Bloomingdale's revenues decrease and they can no longer cover their costs. The quickest solution to that problem is just to lay people off.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	No jobs, no income, no spendable income.  Everyone is not spending money like they used to.  They are spending it on keeping food on the table and a roof over their heads.  People are stretching the dollar as far as they can by shopping at places that are cheaper. The Goodwill  and Salvation Army stores are showing an increase in business because there is no spendable income.  People are getting their priorities in order right now by not spending and waiting to see if the economy will get better in the next 1 - 2 years.|`|7jDyJRLyaa	People are broke!!!!|`|DR4LYQBtaa	The main reason IS the economy. People don't have money to buy gas and food and pay their mortgages let alone go shop at some over priced store such as Bloomingdale's and Macy's. Since people are not shopping as much, the company isn't bringing in as much money. Therefore there isn't enough money to keep employing thousands of people for no reason. You're surprised that Macy's and Bloomingdale's are laying people off, look at how many factories and companies that employ more people than those two stores have laid people off and closed stores or closed plants. Here in Iowa last week over 50,000 people were laid off or fired.|`|mQZDizMVaa	It's a matter of priorities and survival choices. Cambell's Soup or high- price shoes?

OacSIfSiaa	Write them a letter requesting "validation" of this debt (not verification).  Send it via certified mail/return receipt.  In your letter cite the following as to what information you are requesting.    Proof that they own the debt legally or have been legally authorized to collect it from you.   A complete payment history documented from your original creditor. This requirement was established by the case Fields v. Wilber Law Firm, Donald L. Wilber and Kenneth Wilber, USCA-02-C-0072, 7th Circuit Court, Sept 2004.   A copy of the original loan contract that you signed with your creditor.     Also check to see if they are "bonded" in your state to allow them to collect debts.  You can check this out with your State 'Attorney Generals Office.  Some states allow you to search on line.    Also check your states statute of limitations on seeking legal action to collect on credit cards.  Here is a link to find this information  http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-n...  If the debt is "time barred" or also known as beyond state statutes, then you can tell them where to go as they can not seek a lawsuit to collect this debt.  DO NOT make any payments or agreements as this would reset the SOL and then they will take you to court.    If it is NOT time barred, then you still want validation before you take any further action.

Never contact me by phone again, do not call my work leave me alone.  The only other contact they can do is send you a letter saying they will take you to court.    They will do this but make sure you answer when you are served.  If you dont they will get a judgment.  Then they can garnish your wages etc.  It will also affect your credit but im sure they already have with the collection.    When they serve you with notice, deny everything.  They will then ask for information, give the information they ask, then ask for everything back.  They can ask anything they want but so can you.  This can take months if not a year.    Depending on the amount will determine if the attorney keeps going after you.      But to answer your question, yes they can collect its been sold. And no they dont have to prove it until they file against you.  But you can stop all phone calls with one statement.  Never call me again at work or phone.  By law they cant.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Since you already have an attorney  have  him write the letter to the  credit Bureau and Collection Agency. Both usually pay much more attention to a letter from an attorney, It's my understanding that if the collector or the or credit bureau cannot  supply the items you requested they have no proof it is your debt. If I am correct the attorney can probably take care of the whole incident with letters
MMTwV7S7aa	i know what you mean .   you could , get a job ?  babysit ?  sell everything you own ?  ask your parents for money dailey, then keep it ?  beg your friends ?|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE WEBSITES,THEY ARE TRYING TO SCAM YOU|`|QYf4ECgwaa	I had those kind of troubles when I had band trips too. What I did was got another band buddy and made fliers. I sent them to a couple neighborhoods near me , saying that I am a local student collecting money for whatever purpose and to leave cans out a certain day. When I went around to collect a lot of people set out bags for us to take, and we also rang doorbells and people gave us whatever they could. We made 100 dollars each in the matter of probably an 8 hour day.      You can also try the website I use. It makes me about 150 a month, all you do is look at websites and write 3 sentences of what you think about them. It's really easy, I love it.|`|05bV2GuFaa	Maybe you can get a loan from your parents like put out a coupon books like take out trashes or wash cars etc... so they can have the booklet of coupon to request you to do things.    Babysitting is legal, maybe not fun or a little patient requires, but sometimes you just have to do something you don't like in order to get what you want.... (more things like these are ahead of you)|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Cleaning house is another way.  You can get just about anybody to pay you $10 to clean their bathroom, and it should only take you an hour.  $10/hour is only 50 hours of work to get to $500.    When I went on my band trip in high school, I borrowed $250 from my uncle.  He agreed to give me a year to pay it back, and I did.  I babysat.|`|eyQBvbzraa	go a few blocks from your house and offer your services and explain why you are raising money. offer weed pulling,sidewalk sweeping, leave raking and or whatever they want you to do. i dont think your neighbors are cheap. i am a mom and i would not want my 14 yr old mowing because he could get hurt badly from one mistake with a lawn mower.ask if they have any other jobs that you could do.washing windows,going to the store etc. tell them they dont have to pay you till the job is done.this ensures that you wont run off with their money and not do the chores.
kfg1Sw72aa	All i have to say is google.com and currency calculator. best of luck, my friend!|`|Asm4AKOOaa	some banks might list exchange amounts or have ways for calculating this .
oM0mUoW5aa	save 36 $ per day every day|`|cptjaPaSaa	calm down your 13, be a child cause your never going to be able to do it again|`|nLu8OC1Xaa	You are young and you are lucky in the sense that you are at the best time of life to start a savings plan or your own personal financial plan.  Having the goal that you are aiming for is also good but what crosses my mind is if it is realistic?  Of course, I do not mean to belittle your desire to earn money and God knows you might already have the kind of job or business that can be the source of your regular savings.      Anyway, let me get to the answer of your question.  You will need to set aside $710.25 per month earning interest at 10% per annum for a period of 5 years or 60 months in order for you to have the $55,000 at the end of 5 years.    I suggest you take a look at www.talkingofmoney.com so you can be guided SERIOUSLY in your desire to be financially self-reliant.
c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	I think that you should file a 1040 and attach a Schedule C-defining your income that was reported to you on a 1099 and list any and all of the expenses that you incurred to make this money.     Dual citizenship or not, if you leave this money unreported you will be subject to 15.3 percent self employment tax and income tax on the entire amount.      If you can't pay the balance join the IRS club, like so many others. They will catch up with you and it could be a question of tax evasion|`|5b8cfcd0b6b7f584e55b8d9f04d9a78aaa	I don't think you need an answer. It sounds like you have already made your mind up. You don't want to pay taxes so why even ask the question. You did not say "you were not financially able to pay" you have chosen not to. I say join the scums on Wall Street. It is people like you that takes away from our economy. Good riddance.|`|05bV2GuFaa	Oh well, never say never. If you don't pay taxes then when you come back, IRS will track you down and take money from you with interest at that time. You can risk it or try your luck :)
c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	In the United States alimony is taxable, child support is not. You must report your spouses social security number when listing the amount on 1040 line 31a|`|on9xLWegaa	Yes it is!    Consult a tax advisor though!|`|TwqIpHJLaa	The answer is 'yes.'    The Oregon legislature has expressed the intent "to make the Oregon personal income tax law identical in effect to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code relating to the measurement of taxable income of individuals." ORS 316.007.  Therefore, the state courts look to federal law to analyze various support payments.  Alimony payments, as defined in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 71(b), (3) are includible in the gross income of the recipient and are deductible by the payor.     Hope this helps!|`|2e62d29ca71042d3063c01dbc6a89c92aa	the one recieiving the money pays the tax..the giver gets the break. It isnt fair..its usually the woman with the kids that has to pay the tax and she needs the money most of all.
Asm4AKOOaa	well it doesn't happen over night , i imagine they have money or existing connections within the fashion industry to get there lines started . i can't picture an average person doing it by themself to be honest .
PKfh0jhLaa	don't you wonder when any sort of program advertises  "You can stay home and make all the money you want"    Really, there are limitations and to advertise total PIE IN THE SKY sort of earnings potential is a bit much don't you think?    There is no Magical internet pot 0' gold!    BEWARE - QUESTION EVERYTHING    A! Where are we going?  why are we in this handbasket?|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Read the disclaimers and you will know why they are all scams!  Internet work at home jobs scams are up 400% due to the economy according to Fox News.|`|JZkGQIyjaa	I think you should contact Avon and become a sales rep. You can stay home and make all the money you want!! Google the word Avon and you might get their official website, see if you're interested. I know this one is not a scam. All you have to do is show their sale books every month to people / distribute them, encourage people to buy, and place orders online under your name. They also give you some discounts if you buy. GOOD LUCK!!!!   p.s. Hope that helps!
yO5tm6e1aa	You're living the nightmare that every middle class worker fears.  You probably made $100,000 to $200,000 a year in a middle management corporate job and now are stuck managing a bunch of teenagers at the local McDonald's for a mere $30,000.  Obviously, this isn't enough to cover your housing, medical, insurance, and food expenses.  There are only 3 choices:  1)  Shoot yourself for not having a contingency plan.  2)  Look for friends and family to help pay the essentials so you can look for a comparable job.  3)  Downsize your life significantly.... selling assets and going back to how you lived in College.|`|2K84ouyKaa	i am a small business owner that in this economy is so tough to make it i have had to shut my cabinet shop and find a job at a local temp agency but i am doing what i can and i try not to get too frustrated and i started a fuel treatment business that is looking like it will do very well for me i guess what i am trying to say is that there are options out there|`|5nYC6RM1aa	Trust me...I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL    I just found the same thing out yesterday about my job. The Director took me aside and told me that I have to get a pay cut and I was fuming because it's actually MORE work than I would normally do and LESS pay. I know everyone says 'oh be grateful for it' bla bla 'the economy' bla bla but screw that...I won't settle for that. I'm already looking for another job and so should you.    To: MELISSA     Cynical is an understatment for that comment you wrote. Grow up.|`|jtjISk6qaa	your not the only one.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	Be grateful that you have something.  At least you got another job.  I haven't been able to find any paying job in over six months and am expecting to receive notice of foreclosure on my home by March 1st.|`|rUN9Dca2aa	Just try to keep your spirits up and be grateful for what you do have in life.  Many people are without any employment in this economy, and it could be a lot worse.  My husband and I are struggling, and we both have college degrees and good work records.  I have a law degree and am having a lot of trouble finding gainful employment.     Just don't do anything crazy, like try to hurt yourself.  The most important thing is to keep your mental and physical health strong.      Good luck!|`|4wUuQpIfaa	Did you hear about the Business graduate who had to post his resume on the back of his seat of the taxi he drove? You are not the only one!     Not to be cynical, but your spelling does not indicate the grammar of a high paying job holder.|`|55842464ae6c3f98aec8b9725d2a9f18aa	Try not to perceive this as a loss.  If you look at it as an opportunity to discover the fact that money does not equal happiness, you'll get through it.  I have been affluent and broke, happy and miserable, and money was never the determining factor.  All money does is to enable you to buy more expensive toys, and just like little children, we get tired of them quickly.  If you are up to it, volunteering to help out some folks who are really in a bad way will put things in perspective for you.  Your situation is not permanent!!!|`|wXx8RcOvaa	Don't feel so bad, like some have said, "at least you've found another job"  I'm about to be laid off and I am living with a lot of debt and trying to raise a family.  Be thankful you have that job, there's some of us that are about to lose their homes and pretty much the shirt off their back.  At this point you shouldn't be complaining as long as you are working!!!
