But just now, my cable provider conducted a "digital" test and on my screen it said the test "failed...you are not ready for digital broadcast."    Is my TV digital? I really thought it was. My cable is provided by my apartment complex (via satellite dish), and I have it hooked up to my DVD player, which is in turn hooked up to my TV. Could that be the reason the test failed?

20090128175832AADyeli	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Using an iPhone from AT&T?	I was wondering if it where possible for someone else to buy the iPhone, and give it to me to activate as my own. My sister was going to buy the iPhone and give it to me to use. I would purchase the data plan of course to place on it, but was wondering if she would be able to remove her own data plan after purchasing it so she could use her blackberry data plan? Basically, would she be able to replace the iPhone data plan with a Blackberry data plan after giving it to me? She would still be under contract though. We share a plan. We both have Blackberry's, but I want an iphone now. The thing is, I'm not eligible for an upgrade yet and she is. She would only be I guess transferring it to me? I would still pay for the data plan and such, but It would be for my number, not hers.

Initially I was looking into a DVD home theater system.  It looks like this may work, but won't the speakers only be used during dvd playback (and they are pretty pricey)?      Next, I considered using some 2.1 computer speakers.  This would work perfect except there is no remote control so I would have to get up and manually adjust the volume.      Also, this tv's only audio output is a digital audio coaxial out.      Basically, I just want some amplified speakers with a remote :)  What do you recommend?!  Thanks!!

20090128174205AAugYJU	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Major PS3 Problems, help!!!?	Let me first start off by saying that I'm pretty good with electronics, but I need some help. I've had my PS3 since '06, no problems with my 60GB. But, my cousin got the MGS4 80GB bundle, and this is the one with errors.    I went to my cousin's house today, and his uncle had left his PS3 on for God knows how long after attempting to put a DVD in it. I came to their house today and found the PS3 on with the green light flashing, and the television off. I held the power off button, but it beeped and kept flashing and didn't go into standby mode. I manually flipped the switch and of course it turned off. I went to flip it back and it went into standby mode. I pressed the power button, assuming it was a temporary error. How wrong I was.    When it first turned on, it gave me a list of options that I'd never seen before. Some said "Restore Factory Settings" some said "Restart PS3" so I chose the latter.    It restarted, but none of the icons loaded, instead the refreshing symbol for everything under the Game part of the XMB. When I scrolled left, there was nothing but empty space for Video, Music, and Photo. Even the PSN network had nothing. So, I ejected the game disk(GTAIV) and restarted it. Trouble was that it did the same thing, I had to manually flip the switch. It turned on again, this time the icons loaded under the Settings part of the XMB. I chose system settings, hoping to restore factory settings without formatting the HDD(I wouldn't want to erase his gamesaves of course) but it actually froze.    It continued to repeat this, so I remembered the trick where you hold the power button for a few seconds until it restores settings.(Like when you had it set to a certain video setting and then :you are using different cables) It turned on, but the only difference was that it was in 4:3 instead of 16:9. Now, the same problems arose. I don't know, anybody else experience problems like this? My PS3 has been nearly perfect since launch, I fear his uncle may have tampered with it somehow trying to play the DVD.    Sorry for these HUGE walls of text, any help would be appreciated.

20090128174558AATC7ZX	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	Help me understand about this DVR craze.  OK, supposedly you can pause live TV if you have to leave the room..?	for a second.  When you get back you can start watching where you left off.  OK, my question is, if you pause live tv and then watch where you left off, then it's not "live tv" anymore.  It's going to be behind for the amount of time you were gone, right?  So isn't it just like watching a recorded television show?

20090128175812AAM49sp	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	Old Type Adventure PC Games?	I used to play games like Loom, Conquests of the Longbow: The Legend of Robin Hood (I think that was the name), 7th Guest, 11th Hour and similar PC games in the 90s and I am looking for any games of today that might be similar.     My boyfriend and daughter both play World of Warcraft but I don't like fighting games. I'm not against them, I just don't do well in them. I did try one with spells years ago but it had fighting in it, too.  I just prefer the adventure/puzzle games (not arcade).     I didn't do well with the kinds of games that came after these, like Myst and such. All I ended up doing was walking in circles!    Does anyone know of any online or to buy that are similar to older style games? I have Vista, BTW.

20090128180152AALjUK5	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Is there any way I can do this with my iPod touch?	I have a second generation 16 gb iPod touch. I dropped it in the snow the other day, but there was a case on it and a screen protector. I think some moisture got into the speaker/charging hole though. I dropped it yesterday. Last night the battery was low so I put it on my dock station only nothing popped up on the iPod. It usually says it is charging. The dock could still play music so I was really confused. Then I tried to do something and I learned that the home key no longer works. When I try to push it, it doesn't go home. When I double tap it though, the music player thing comes up as it usually does. Today I thought it would be a good idea to restart my iPod, only it won't turn off. When I hold the button at the top and let go it just goes to sleep. I can't figure it out. It was charging all last night, and even though the battery sign says it's dead, I've left it playing for like three hours and it hasn't literally died yet. So basically, I'm asking if there's any other way I can restart my iPod or turn it on and off. Please help me! I really need it

20090128183129AA2xfLp	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Can I fix Xbox 360 single red light (E74) problem without doing the x-clamp?	My graphics randomly became a little distorted while playing Halo 3... then the next time I turned on the box, I had the E 74. I'm guessing it's just something with the GPU. Is there any way to fix this just by a simple cleaning or tightening of a few screws on the GPU if I open up the xbox? The warranty with Microsoft is up since I've had the console over a year already, and they want $99 for me to send it in and get repaired, rofl. I'd rather just buy a new one then sending it in and paying half cost to get it fixed (probably crappily) and have it take weeks to get back. Any suggestions? Thank you - anything will help. I have access to Torx screwdrivers and can get washers, but since it's not the 3 red lights, I don't think I have to do the x clamp thing or whatever to fix it. Thanks!
