I feel ugly with them. They are way darker than your average dark circles. They are brownish grey.        Don't tell me to get more sleep or drink more water. These are genetic. And also I don't want any sort of "home remedy". These simply do not work and waste perfectly good produce! So. I was wondering if there are any REALLY good concealers that you guys know of. Or are there any creams that can take care of them? I am looking for something affordable (under 20$) that will do a good job of covering or getting rid of them. I have olive skin and it is hard to find a good concealer. Thanks in advance!

Now I'm dressing a little bit of 'emo' and a little bit of 'prep' and all sorts of things. I love changing my style all the time. I also dye my hair. Currently it's black and I'd like to keep it like that for a while because I don't want to damage it. I also wear black eyeliner and converse all the time. People also see me as a "poser" but I don't really care because it's just clothes so it shouldn't matter. So what should I change my style into?

Yeah, I know, "there's this thing called a hairdryer." But my hair is always somewhat damp after I use a hairdryer, and then it makes my hair frizzy when I straighten it. So, I'm basically just wondering how long, in general, it takes for a person's hair to dry and if I'll have enough time to style it before I have to go.

Well there is this guy i've like for about 9 months now and in the past my best friend liked him after she knew how i felt about him. She felt bad and said she would back off and she never did and i found out recently she sent naked pictures to him. And i see her completely different because.. well she completely back stabbed me and she has had a boyfriend for about 3 years and our close friend just see's her completely differently now too. So we haven't been talking to her.       We weren't rude we just  told her that we needed time to get over it. (this isn't the first chance i have given her. I told her in the past when she did something else to betray me that it was her last chance.)      Okay, our close friend.. we have been talking and we both agreed that we were not going to talk to her until we could trust her again.      Its been 2 days and now she is talking to her again. I dont know how to deal with this.       What do i do?

A few weeks ago I saw 3 different guys with these nice long sleeve shirts on (casual, but nice...like long sleeve polos if I remember right), but they stuck out because they had skulls with wings on the back. All 3 of the guys were black, so I'm thinking it's maybe a new black fashion thing??? I'm just curious if anybody knows what brand makes the shirts. Thanks in advance.      P.S. It's not Ed Hardy or Affliction. The design is similar to the hoodie on www.thegoodzonline.com/store, but they were more like a polo shirt a guy might wear to church?? Except there was the skull with wings on the back.

It healed fine and I've had no problems with it up until yesterday. when I woke up it was a little sore but I figured it was no big deal but now its still kinda sore and theres a little bit of white stuff coming out of the bottom hole. The top hole is fine. could it be infected? what should I do? I'd really hate to take it out.       p.s If your gonna tell me that is ugly or I shouldn't have piercings or whatever then find something else to do with your time because I'm not listening to you.
