Hello, I was just wondering if it were possible to have my hair bleached platinum to white blonde at a professional salon, my hair colour is about level 5-7 (depending on different scales..it's a light brown/dark blond)   I'm looking to enquire on the computer to get several different opinions as well as accumulating a few at salons.    If I came in as a client what process would you use to lighten my hair? Would it be better to come in several times and lighten the hair a little more each time, or would you do it in one sitting?

I'm dressing more like how I want to dress and doing things for me again, rather than trying to please some man.

I don't have loads of cash but would like to change my physical appearance a little. I can't do anything too radical because of work (I have dyed dark red hair and this is probably the most outrageous I could get away with)...       I'm 30. Any ideas?      Thanks in advance.

20061101060421AAFJ4Ol	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Western & asian girls!?	Would you tell me real thing about western girls & asian girls. Sometimes it shows in tv program that girls are wild there so sexy & crazy. Even in beach walk or sleep in the sun shine without bra sometimes without cloths. Even it shows there gilrs are so crazy about sex & do sex with many guys & it doesnt matter before marrage or after marrage. So is it true? Is it really true that western & asian girls are really crazy & like that about sex & dress? Even there girls are crazy about dress. They wear anytype of dress even they dont feel anything to walk in the road with bra & penty. They are crazy about dress. They wear anything they need & dont care about what people think. So is it true? I want to know real about their culture & about them. Are they really like that or not. Sorry in my previous question (same question I did some wrong it was a mistake of my keyboard however thanks for reminding me). I have solved it hope you will answer me quickly now.

20070331222601AAj3tWW	Beauty & Style;Hair	Does sunlight lighten hair...?	I have had a bit of a hard year...I was sick with a terrible virus for ages and the symptoms kept lingering...due to this I was barely out of bed so I didn't get much sunlight. I am now better but I used to be tanned and my hair was a nice brown (not too dark)...I am 16 years old and now my face is really pale which looks terrible because I have medium to dark brown eyes and my hair appears to have gotten darker. If I make an effort to go out in the sun for half an hour (30 minutes) ever day for 3 weeks at least, will my hair colour become lighter(where I live it is nice and sunny most of the time in this part of Australia)? I hate the colour it is now and I'm not sure if It's just my hair getting darker and duller with age or if it is lack of sunlight etc. My ponytail is a nice rich brown which seems like it has a beautiful golden to redish tint to it (shine). Please help! Also, most of my life I've had tanned skin, if I go out in the sun, how long until I tan noticeably? Thankyou.

( it was a dark ash brown) so now i have bought the only thing i think will help me BLEACH..but then again i know it could do the opposite. so i know it will turn orange but if i do a second application would that work?

I have 8 lobe piercings, a cartilage piercing(jan13/07) on my left ear and an industrial bar(jan19/08) piercing on my right ear.       I'm really wanting to get something new and exciting. Following my tradition of getting a new piercing every January in order for the other one to heal fully for a year. For this past year i've been loving the Tragus piercing and the Rook piercing. I love both equally because not to many people that i've known, or seen have them at all.      I don't usually like looking up the draw backs of a piercing online because i'd prefer to see how MY body reacts not somebody else's.      But; if you could maybe give an opinion which one is better - heals faster - and is all over a nicer product. Please let me know.   Thanks in advance.

20090227110224AAh6Hxj	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Was she interested in me or not?  Because she just rejected me?  My entire fraternity is mind-numbed right now?	Here were the signs:      - First day I come in she gazes over and fixes her hair. She looks back twice.   - Next day I sit right behind her. She looks at me weird, a bit startled. I introduce myself.   - When we're walking out and it was raining, she said "sooo would you like to get under my umbrella?" When I refused, she seemed a bit disappointed (I was testing her)   - I walk right up to her and she acts nervous.   - Her eyes get WIDE when she talks to me.   - When shes talking to other guys, she gazes over at me every few minutes.   - When I go to talk to her, she immediately STOPs talking to all guys! And focuses 100% attention on me. The only time she goes back to talking to her guy friends is when introducing me to them lol.   - Her voice changes significantly around me. I heard her talking to a professor once and I didn't even recognize her voice - it was deeper than the one she uses around me.      ok. So we're walking...all of a sudden I say "wanna have dinner on friday?" And she rejected me! She said she was already dating someone. But her facebook says shes single....2 days after she rejected me, she took down the "single" status, but deleted the news feed (caught it in time!). The day after, she came to class with full-on makeup. She shoots a sharp glance over at me. And that was it.      I don't get it?? What the hell is going on? I'm guessing she wasn't interested, but was just being a flirt?

20090227111457AAnFws7	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I'm a shy guy & I went to a sauna last week, why does my friend Sarah think this is the funniest thing EVER?	So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese sauna/spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???

20081003075509AASeKYP	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Why is My tattoo is messing up?	I got two tattoo 5 days ago. I got a small heart on my leg and a half braclet on my inner wrist. The one on my leg is healing properly. But the one on my wrist is not. It burns and stings really bad and all the ink is running down my hand. I have been doing everything the way i was told. I have had two tattoo prior to these one and none of them have done this. It is scabbing up really bad too. does anyone know whats wrong with it and what i can do to fix it? The tattoo artist said he can touch it up for free but i am worried if i get it touched up it could do the same thing again.

Im thinking about starting to wear v neck t-shirts and I got 2 v necks and the v is really high (there is only about a centimeter difference than the circular width). Do people think that this is gay looking because i know a lot of gay guys wear v necks but the v goes way down their chest like a girls v neck.

I've had some very bad experience with skin products containing benzoyl and salicylic acid, even with minimal amounts.  They dry out my zits at first, but when I use it more, it irritates my skin badly, and my skin dries and flares-up.        I was told I have oily, sensitive skin, and I should try products with sulfur.  Is sulfur non-irritating?  Are there any skin products for sensitive skin, but will help get rid of my zits?  I already use a facial wash for prevention.

I am a Mexican-American and I'm very, very hairy, in fact it's sort of embarrassing just how covered in hair my body is. However, I've noticed that when it comes to Mexicans, we are either really hairy or nearly hairless.   But I've also noticed that, at least with Mexicans, men who are tall tend to be the hairiest, whereas men who're short tend be the most hairless.Why is this so?   It's always kind of been on my mind, so I just figured I might as well ask it here.
