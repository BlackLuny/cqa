20090225080627AA46lOP	Business & Finance;Investing	How should I invest my savings to decrease my taxable income?	March 2nd is the RRSP deadline.   I have some savings that i want to invest however I am unsure where to put the funds. Here is my situation:   Last year was the first time I invested in an RRSP (low risk), however, as everyone knows, the market was bad last year, so I have lost about 18% of the initial investment.   I want to put my savings into something safe that will decrease my taxable income for 2008. Keep in mind that I also will be wanting to access my funds within the next year (possibly 2 at the very most) for a 1st time home purchase.   I am afraid to put the money into another mutual fund - I do not fair well with money stress, and just like to know my savings are safe, but also working for me in terms of decreasing the taxes I pay.   Any advice? I heard about a GIC but dont know a lot about them.   Thanks   signed,   newbie to the investment world

For example I found a stock which if the 5min charts and 30 min charts convergence in specific time frame the success rate of getting $1 is 90%.   I found 3 stocks each with different pattern and I enjoyed it so much as I earn $100-$200 per day with 90% success rate.      Do you believe some stocks had a price pattern that not by the book but applicable in trading?      Because I found it like magic and I couldn't fully believe it yet.

I checked the date of the last one and it says Aug 2006 on the sticker stuck to the front of the boiler, i can't find any more paper documentation.    I had a dubious phone conversation with the rental agents who claimed it had been done 16th Sept 2008 although it took them a few minutes of faffing and mumbling to find the date. She also couldn't get me off the phone quick enough.      It is the landlords responsibility to get it serviced but how often?!

20090225133015AAa2kgK	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I need your input about this?	my husband and I are looking at houses to purchase, and we found one that has a lot of geat qualities plus 8 acres for a great price.  The only thing I hate about it, is that it has two bedrooms upstairs (master and other), and the basement is complete with two other bedrooms,  The basement has a door that leads outside.  I have a 2 year old, and we are trying for another.  If I get pregnant soon, the baby would be in the room upstairs, but my son would have to be downstairs, and I personally hate the fact that he would have to stay downstair by himself (he would be around 3 years).  Then there is the door downstairs, and if someone breaks in (God forbid), I won't know until morning.  What are your thoughts?  I guess one option is that I could keep them in the same room until he gets a bit older, but I would still feel insecure about him staying downstair by himself.

Is there any specialty where you can walk around and help but NOT be put in situations where you might have to lift heavy equipment or patients?  I know there is a shortage of nurses so I was hoping there is a way for a talented future RN (1st year school) to work without lifting.  Since it's still 1st year of the program (has a general Bachelors already) is there a path or other degree that pays well and is in demand- again- with no lifting?  Plus I think working in a hospital which I hear is typical- would be very stressful.

Je suis une jeune fille de 22 ans qui habite à N?mes. Une piscine olympique est en fin de construction (ouverture septembre 2007) et j'ai envoyé ma candidature. J’ai passer un entretien collectif le 18 juin 2007 pour le poste d'h?tesse d'accueil, le 9 juillet 2007 il me contacte pour un entretien individuel .Mon profil les intéresse vraiment beaucoup car je suis une personne polyvalente qui à 4 ans d'expérience dans les piscines (entretien, h?tesse d'accueil et formations ma?tre nageur sauveteur). Jeudi dernier le directeur m'appel en personne en me disant que ma candidature n'étais pas retenue, j’avais du mal à y croire car je conna?t déjà tout dans le fonctionnement et l’organisation d'une piscine .Mais le directeur me fais comprendre qu'il me veut absolument donc il me propose une place à l'entretien. Le lundi je décide de l'appeler pour avoir plus de renseignement en ce qui concerne le poste d'agent d'entretien et pour savoir pourquoi ma candidature n'avait pas été retenue. Il me donne un rendez-vous l'après midi même. Sa secrétaire me re?oit et m'annonce que des l'entretien collectif leur choix été porté sur moi mais elle me dit la ville en à voulu autrement. Le Directeur me dit exactement la même chose qu'il me veulent absolument au poste d'h?tesse d'accueil. Au moment ou il aller m'appeler pour me donner une réponse positive pour se poste juste avant il avait appelé une autre personne pour refuser sa demande mais cette personne conna?t quelqu'un de haut placer donc elle fait intervenir cette personne. Une personne de N?mes Métropole appel le Directeur et lui fait part de son mécontentement et le directeur c'est senti obliger de prendre cette personne car c'est la ville qui les finance. Donc aujourd'hui j'aurais pu avoir un poste en cdi à 35h que demander de mieux. Je me suis battue pour se poste, j’ai montrer ma motivation. Le directeur me dit qu'il veut me prendre que j'ai un profil incroyable mais il ne peut pas faire autrement. J’ai méritée cette place mais on me la volée en plus le directeur me dit que la personne pistonnée excusez moi du terme n'a pas du tout le profil donc il me conseil d'attendre la période d'essai qui est de 1 mois renouvelable 1 mois. Mais c'est injuste car j'ai méritée cette place est normalement c'est la mienne

I cant let my parents know hes giving me the money.  heck, they dont even know i gave him the 400 to begin with.  if my parents found out i gave a friend 400, they'd kill me.        so if he gave me a check, is it possible to have it not show up in the records? cuz ive cashed checks before, and they "deposit" the money first and then immediately withdraw the money.  but that shows up in the records.  and when my parents go to view the records they will see that, and ask questions.      ive been told that if he has a diff bank than i do, i can cash it from his bank, with no hassle.  but that seems unlikely to me.   how does pay pal work? can he give me money via paypal and that might not show up??      basically i want my money back (of course) but i cant have any records of a deposit.  i dont care if its deposited or if i cash it, just what ever doesnt show up...

Up until the 13th, I had a 2006 Fusion that was unfortunately totaled in an accident due to snow. I was able to get that car because my mom took out the loan for me. But since she has two cars plus our house on her credit [my dad and her are joint owners of it]...her debt to income ratio pretty much froze her credit even though her score is really good, so she can't co-sign with me for anything. My dad pays cash for everything and has never had anything other than the house on his credit, so he can't be used as a co-signer either, because he has next to no credit. I have a car priced at about $8000 through a private seller picked out. Now I just need to find a loan. I've noticed there are a lot of dealerships out there that will finance people with bad credit, BUT you have to go through that dealership in order to get the financing. Are there any places that offer car loans to people with bad credit WITHOUT going through a dealer? Thanks in advance.

Will I get that 8,000 credit back in my taxes in the following year?  Would my sister and I qualify?   I have never owned a home before and my credit fico is fairly good at 765.  I have a credit line of 30,000 and only 5k debt.  My sister on the other hand has about 40k debt in loans and has owned a home within the last three years. Her credit is lower than mine but she makes nearly a six figure income. I know if we buy a house together we will not exceed the 150k limit requirement  to qualify for first time home owner tax credit since my income does not exceed 50k but would the fact that she has owned a home recently disqualify us from the tax credit or would me being a first time home buyer fulfill the requirement regardless that she has owned a home recently if we buy together?  Would it be advisable that I purchase the home in my name if she will not qualify and just transfer her into the deed and mortgage at a later time once the tax credit is received in the next tax year? Also, in regards to foreclosures through auctions do you think they are a good idea? Do you deal with foreclosures auctions? I know a home can be obtained for much less than market value via these means.

Working in Agriculture - required to build strong relationships with growers, co-product customers and colleagues.       In the process of securing sales of the Animal Feed co-product when you receive the news that one of your biggest customers are considering sourcing this from an alternative supplier. You understand that the reason this farmer may be considering a change is that the other company is selling the product at a reduced price due to surplus stock, and has made a commitment to hold the price static for the following 12 months. As one of your key buyers of Animal Feed, you do not want to lose the contract, which is vital if you are to meet your sales target.      What would you do in this situation to retain the contract with the farmer?      ? How might you influence them to continue purchasing Animal Feed from Company?   ? How might you overcome his objections?   ? Who else might you involve?   ? What alternative options would you consider?
