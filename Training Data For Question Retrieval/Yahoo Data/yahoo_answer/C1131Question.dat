20090222154135AAvoiPs	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair problem ! Its like I've tried EVERYTHING!! & Nothing's happened =/?	So the right side of my hair is REALLY longer than the left side. The front of my left side is really short, & my edges in the front is breaking off. I don't know what to do anymore. I wash my hair every 2-3 weeks, I condition it, I trim it every 2 months, & every 2 months I get a relaxer. I trimmed my right side, but it just grew back longer than the original length.      What can I do to the front of my left side, so it can at least grow 2 inches possibly? Thanks! =]

20090222160024AAAaolP	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is this not a funny painting?? Whats the real story behind Godiva?	Im taking art history this year and every day we study look at art and like a few days ago, our teacher showed us the painting of Lady Godiva. and like she said that the story behind the inspiration for the painting is not clear, like we know who painted the painting and all, but now who the real Godiva was. She said that most people believe that like she was this english woman that sort of did something for the people or whatever by accepting this sort of, idk, i guess u could call it a dare by her husband to go riding naked through town, lol, but apparently theres a lesser known story of a teenage girl of royal ancestry in france in like the middle ages that was really mean to everyone and animals and also very cruel, so according to this legend, her mother gave her the choice of other being disowned, and thus becoming a peasant just like most of the people she had been so cruel to, or if not then learning the "essence of shame." apparently this girl believed that since she was royal, she was completely superior and could be cruel since it was "honorable" to be cruel to dirty and thus "shameful" peasants, so her mom taught her that you could be royal and "shameful" by having to ride her horse, to whom she had been cruel to, naked, through town, while the horse was dressed elegantly, like she usu. was, and that she would be shameful in comparison to a kind, although shabbily dressed peasant. Which do you think is the real story?     http://media.photobucket.com/image/lady%...

I got it pierced on February 14, and have cleaned it with the Satin anti-bacterial soap that they gave us twice a day, every day since then, as well as soaking it in a saline solution.   It was fine for the first three days, but then it started to throb, and now it's swollen to about twice its size, which I've heard is somewhat normal.   It doesn't bleed or ooze, but sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and find crust on it, but that comes off when I clean it.     I've heard the majority of this is pretty normal, but the only thing I'm concerned about is the amount of pain, and the amount of time it's been (it's been a week and a day).   ps- Please don't answer this unless you have a real source or actual experience..in other words serious answers please (:

20090222132241AA0YwNO	Beauty & Style;Hair	I need some serious hair advice. Will somone help?	I over dyed my hair during this summer in August.My hair was blonde, but i got advice that platinum would suit me from a close friend. Since i us to always go to professionals i was inexperienced with boxed dies. Since it was so cheap i decided to take that route instead. I over dyed my hair to soon AGAIN because the first time it didn't come out the appropriate colour. I reused the dye only 1 week after for another platinum shade. I left it on maybe 10 minutes too long as well. Like an idiot i re did my roots way to soon after as well in early september only about 3 weeks after dying my head twice. My hair was fried! I had to cut off all my beautiful long hair.In total i cut off about 7+ inches from monthly trims. My hair is pretty much healthy again and about half of it is my natural. I am unhappy with the colour however and i want to go back to the medium blonde hair i had before that i loved oh so much. I had that colour for 4 years until i decided to go to that hideous platinum. I haven't died my hair nor my roots since early september. How much longer should i wait to dye my hair again? Im going professional 100% this time and i'm only planning to dye roots every 2 months since my natural is pretty light anyways roots won't be soo obvious. Please don't judge me too much.. i just want to be able to love my hair again.

20090222135032AAvtGHA	Beauty & Style;Hair	Every time I shave my pubic hair I get a rash?	Okay so I used to shave alot, until I began to let my boyfriend put his hands down my pants, if you like.    As soon as he started doing this I began to get a rash if I had shaved. So, I stop shaving for awhile, about 2 months until the rash cleared up. It was started to bug me because I prefure it shaven down there. Anyways, I used this hair removal cream instead of shaving, and it worked, but yet again, I got a rash.      Me and my boyfriend wondered if he had been touching something I may be allergic to, so everytime before we done something he washed his hands furelly. But that didn't work either!      Does anyone know why I have this rash? :S

It has a little bit of damage at the ends, but not too much because I rarely blow dry or flat iron. It has normal moisture. I'm looking for a really good deep conditioner. Right now, I' m using John Frieda Frizz- Ease Strengthening Masque every time I shower after L'oreal Vive Pro shampoo and am pretty happy with the results. But I'm wondering what else is out there. I'm not going to use mayonnaise because it made my hair greasy and smell gross. I like John Frieda, and things that smell good. My price range is about up to $10, give or take some depending on the size of the bottle.   Thanks!

20090222112933AAoW9Po	Beauty & Style;Hair	THICK HAIR PLEASE HELP!!!?	hey!! okay my hair is THICK!! and when i say thick i mean super super thick!!  when i straighten it, i wash it, blow dry it for 20-30 minutes, then straighten it for 1 hour or more and then it's straight, not wavy, but NOT FLAT.  so i've pretty much given up on flat hair and i thought that maybe i could curl it.  so i've tried a few times to put my hair in curlers and sleep in them overnight and it works pretty good except that it makes it really curly.  and curling irons DON'T WORK on me at all!!  my hair is a little longer than my shoulder by about 1 inch, it's not that long, and i'm trying to grow it out.  after i get out of the shower, it's wavy, then when i brush it, it gets straighter, and it looks good wet, but it eventually dries and then it's kinda wavy, REALLY THICK, and kind of poofy.  i don't have the patience to straighten it every day for 1 1/2 hours, but i'm willing to work on it for up to 45 minutes a day.  when i put my hair in a pony tail, which i often do because it's so annoying, it is REALLY thick and wavy in strange places, like not everywhere.  kind of like the ends are a little bit flippy in random places.  I HATE IT!!  i thought about getting it permanently straightened, but it costs way too much.  i was thinking about letting it grow out, but it takes literally FOREVER!!!  if anyone can help me with ideas of how to treat it with products or haircuts or anything please please please help me!!  every answer is appreciated!!  oh, and i don't want to spend a thousand dollars on hair products, but a few is okay.  and most hairstyles don't work on me, just to let you know, but if you know of any it would be appreciated especially if you have pictures!!!  thanks so much!!   <3,   M

I bought this shirt that I Absolutely love about 2 weeks ago, and after 3 wears the elastic that goes around the neckline all around to the back has worn out. It's an empire waist, and I was Absolutely smitten with it. the elastic that goes around the back is still "springy" but around the chest (which is most important, because now my boobs are exposed!) has given out. I want to know if there is any possible way that I can fix this? I was thinking about adding a new elastic by ripping out the stitches, and just replacing the old one, but I'm not that experienced and I don't have money for a tailor (or a new shirt for that matter). Does anyone know if this type of solution is possible, if there is a video/instruction guide that you know of, if you've done it yourself, or if it ISNT possible, but you know of a way to fix this? I will very grateful to anyone who can answer my question! Thanks :)

20090222111416AANsExu	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I need dress-up help!!!?	For an English project, all of the kids in my class have to pick a day to dress-up by wearing clothes from a different era.  My plan was to wear 80s fashion, but I need a little help.  I thought I'd do bright blue eye shadow, with pink lipstick, and wear my hair in a side pony tail.  As for the outfit, I'm a little puzzled.  I have leg warmers, but I don't know what kind of shoes to wear them with.  I have a big-beaded neon orange necklace, too.  I also have a mini skirt and converse.  I was thinking about some kind of long t-shirt/sweatshirt with a thick belt, but I don't know where I could get the shirt.  I'm also unsure of what to wear on the bottom.  Like I said, I have a mini skirt.  I also have skinny jeans.  Basically, I have some of the pieces, but I'm not certain how I should put them all together.  I am going shopping tomorrow if anyone knows where I could get some things that would work well.  The pieces don't have to be over-the-top, just 80s-esque.  If you can find anything (especially the shirts I was talking about) at Target, that would be amazing because that's where I'm probably going.  Links would be very helpful!  THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!! :D

It's horrible, I always get paranoid when the wind blows my hair back! :(. The rest of my hair is fine, although from sleeping on it in a weird position and because of previous styling, the left side is thin too but ok looking, but my hair is thick and ok overall, is there anyway I can get rid of the bald patch? It's been like this for a while and it seems like there's no hope! :(. I'm 19 and not ready to face a combover! I know I should've been more sensible when I was younger :(. Thanks in advance guys! x

20090222164718AAQsNxy	Beauty & Style;Hair	How can I get my hair to look like Anakin Skywalker?	I want my hair to look like Anakin's (from episode 3). No I'm not a creepy Anakin fanboy. We just have similar hair. Anyway, I can't quite get it right. I found pictures of Anakin on the internet. Here's a jpeg of them:       http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j131/T...       See, the one on the bottom is how my hair looks now. See it? It's just a little uglier. I want it to look more like the two on the top.      I don't know if it's just the lighting or the angle, but the two on top look better. I think it's the texture. How can I make my hair a little less flat to my head like that? It curls out at the bottom but the top is flat so it looks bell-shaped. Is there some sort of product I can get or something I can do to make it puff our more on top?      Right now I use "Garnier fructuse surf hair" to give it a bit of texture, and it does make it less flat to my head, but after a while it starts looking bad.

20090222164118AA42UO4	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Question to all girls who think they've got a Big Butt in comparison to the rest of your body?	Hey, I know this question sounds a bit silly but hear me out..!   This is something that i've heard quite a few times from other girls whose booty is quite big in comparison to the size of the rest of their bodies.   A lot of them say that having a bubble butt shape makes it feel more comfy and soft when they sit becuase they have more cushion to sit on!   I didn't think this was true before, but now I've been working out more and eating more than I used to, so my butt is a lot more bubbly, sexy and curvy shaped . And now I notice when I sit, it does feel quite cushy and soft. Sort of like better cushioning lol!!   So my question is to anyone who also has a big butt, does your butt also feel quite cushioned and comfortable to sit on? Do you also think there's some truth to this?!!!   Serious answers only lol

20090222164516AA9d3Dz	Beauty & Style;Hair	I need some hair advice?	I'm wanting to get my hair done in 2 weeks, I got it done 1 week ago, so when I get it done, it would have been 3 weeks since I got it done. I got partial blonde and dark copper highlights over my brown hair, that didn't turn out the way that I wanted it to. The blonde is too light, and the copper just doesn't fit. I want to get dark blonde and caramel highlights, I thought that I would leave some of the lighter blonde highlights though, so the dark blonde and caramel would cover the copper highlights, and some of the blonde highlights. Would it be safe if I put dark blonde and caramel highlights over the previous dye from 3 weeks? Or should I remove the highlights with a color remover at the salon? Are color removers harsh for your hair though? By safe/harsh I mean, would my hair fall out, would it be really dry, would the color turn out, would it be brittle? What should I do, dye over the previous dye, or remove all of the color? Thanks!

20090222181250AApIyg3	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Question to everyone about YOUR butt!!!?	Hey, I know this question sounds a bit silly but hear me out..!   This is something that i've heard quite a few times from other girls whose booty is quite big in comparison to the size of the rest of their bodies.   A lot of them say that having a bubble butt shape makes it feel more comfy and soft when they sit becuase they have more cushion to sit on!   I didn't think this was true before, but now I've been working out more and eating more than I used to, so my butt is a lot more bubbly, sexy and curvy shaped . And now I notice when I sit, it does feel quite cushy and soft. Sort of like better cushioning lol!!   So my question is to anyone who also has a big butt, does your butt also feel quite cushioned and comfortable to sit on? Do you also think there's some truth to this?!!!   Serious answers only lol

I don't have any metal allergies, so that's out. So, if you can think of anything that will infect the piercings or any other things that will close them up, it would be much appreciated.      The piercings are standard ear piercings, and have not been gauged. They are the second piercing in each ear and they are uneven, but my mom wouldn't let me take them out when I was younger so they could heal and I could get them re-pierced so they would be even.

20090222170223AARM4kS	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Dried out tattoo not healing?	I got my first tattoo about a month and a half ago. Everything went well. I applied lotion to it atleast 6 times a day for the first two or three weeks, and then continued to use it atleast twice a day afterwards. I've heard that while healing, the tattoo goes through two layers of peeling. If that's the case, I'd say the first layer peeled off fine, within the first week or so. I left it alone, didn't pick at it or scratch it, and it was over within a few weeks. But after that, the tattoo completely stopped peeling and itching, but it remained crackled and dried-out looking. It still feels a bit raised when I run my hand over it, as well. Its been over a month, shouldn't that layer of skin have peeled off?  The thing is, it doesn't even look as if its beginning to peel, it just stays the same. Is this normal? And if not, what should I do?

I have also never colored my hair so that helps keep it healthy.  BUT I just got it trimmed and it had been about a year so I had done a lot of damage.  However, the hairstylist cut about three inches off and said she got all of the damage.  My hairstylist told me 8 weeks but I wasn't sure if that was her wanting to make money or if it would need that.
