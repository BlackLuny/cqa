MiDrZfxQaa	Yes you can colour it but why would you want to.  The product is only to create a level surface you can put flooring on top of - e.g. tiles or wood flooring.  The compound itself has no wearing qualities so why colour what you must cover up?|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Provided you don't overdo it - it should be OK.  (If I were you I would experiment with a little bit first).|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes the powder type colouring can be used|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	I don't see why not.  I have used self levelers on many occasions but have never colored it.  The stuff  I have used was a very dark gray when wet and a very light gray when dried.  Only to be used for 1/2" or less but i have used it deeper with no problems, just takes a lot longer to cure.    Good luck|`|94c074323d655df56f196433e8a4506baa	I have tried this before and it worked with no adverse effects on the preformance of the compound .... however the "whitening" of the product  didnt make for a very attractive finish it seemed to have a very inconsistant color with white patches as cement based products seem to do|`|92mCyiLSaa	Yes you can !
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Use a hair dryer on the pipes that are most exposed to the elements.  Takes a while, but effective.|`|EmgiGg17aa	First off:  xnay the old wives tale about moving water never freezing.  Rivers freeze.  Water underground more than 2 feet will remain as liquid water - that is why the pipes and sewer lines are buried.      You have to have some idea as to how your house is plumbed.  It is incorrect somewhere.   Somewhere, the water is piped to an outside wall.  (that is a big no-no) mainly because of the chance of freezing.  You have found that out now.  You may know of some insulation wrapped around some exposed pipe somewhere?   Insulation is just that.   It it insulates.  It does not heat - it does not freeze whatever is with in it.  It just keeps the same temperature longer.  A thermos bottle has insulation so whatever you put inside it (hot or cold) will stay hot or cold longer....it takes longer but sooner or later it becomes the same temperature as the surroundings.    If you live in a trailer(mobile home) then chances are the plumbing is under the floor in the skirted area and that is where it is frozen.  Whatever pipe is exposed to the outside temperatures.     Nothing you can do except wait for the weather to get warmer.   The plumber is stuck with the same problem...looking for the cold section of exposed pipe and heating that up with something (hair dryer  on plastic or torch-which is used on steel  pipe)    Everything that uses water is hooped at this moment...that means the toilet too.  It will not refill.        What you can do in the meantime...is open the taps and leave open, then open the cabinet doors under the sink and leave them open so they get the room warmth on the pipes.  Same story in the bathroom....also leave the bathroom door open so it is as warm as the house.   >Never leave the bathroom or kitchen or laudry room without heat.   They are the rooms that "have to" be heated.    Then I would phone up the utility company that supplies you with water and ask if there is a problem in the mains.  If there isn't, it is your place that is the problem.  You can only wait patiently for the plumber to phone(sounds like he is very busy today).|`|AA10097817	Use a hair dryer on the pipes to warm them up. Turn the faucet on first!|`|dv3hlHRhaa	Keep a space heater on the most exposed pipes and do this ahead of time when the freezing temperatures are forcasted.  Good luck.|`|T5UBrKZjaa	First open all the cold water faucets, then remove any/all aerators from any/all faucets. Next you can either use a hair dryer or a torch however you should make sure that you don't place all the heat in one place. You need to move your heat source to different locations along the pipe. You can also buy a device from a hardware/home improvement store to wrqp the pipes in the future to eliminate your problem. WARNING though if you use that device know you could end up with a burst pipe so use the dryer first, unclog the pipe then install the device|`|3yzpx3HSaa	look for the main water line that comes into your house for it to have frozen that quick the pipe would have to be exposed to the outside air  or a cross breeze in the crawl space under your house you can also look at your water meter to see if you have a leak  most meters have a leak indicator on them to help detect small leaks. once you found the frozen pipe use a heat gun or hair drier to thaw the pipes|`|2gRdi0xRaa	You can buy tape that has a Heat element in it.It will un thaw and if left on the pipes it will keep them from freezing in the future.  Good Luck.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	The problem sounds like your main water pipe is frozen or there is a problem with the supply.  If as you seem to imply no water comes out any of the faucets.   Water pipes generally will take several hours to freeze up.     Go look on the outside of your home at all of your exterior doors to see if a notice was placed on the door.  Sometimes when your water is shut off (broken main or some other problem) they will place a notice on your door.    If any water runs in any of your faucets it is not a supply line problem .  Try to isolate the problem.  If it is your supply line there may not be much you can do on your own.    Now if your own supply line is frozen then try the following.    Open the cabinet doors under your sinks and in the bathrooms.  place a hair dryer against the pipe that feels the coldest where it enters your house.    If it is an isolated sink place the hair dryer against the pipe under that sink.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Yes, your contract is the last word.  It's sad that people who are looking desperately for a place to stay will sign almost anything without thinking about it and end up regretting it.  I don't know what state you're in, but here in California, there's a periodical you can find at the library called California Renter's Rights.  It's very thick and full of very interesting laws concerning everything about tenant-landlord relationships, including security deposits.  Did you know the landlord is supposed to deposit the security deposit in an interest-earning account?  See if there's a similar periodical for your state...|`|ww12lItvaa	Most states have "Landlord-Tenant laws" and they can vary state to state. Do a search for that term and your state and you will likely find it. It is a common issue and they will send you a copy or you can download it.     Here and in many places the law dictates what they can do and charge.     For instance depending on how long you were there, I think if it is a year or more, they can't charge for paint because that is considered "normal maintenance" which they are responsible for, unless there is some particular damage by you. A least in my state.    The laws trump contracts. You can't change the law by contract.     Good Luck.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Look at your contract.  It doesn't matter what a website says you have to abide by the contract.  And unfortunately it's set up to protect the landlord from the tenant, not the other way around.  You should have taken pictures before you moved in and yes take them again when you move out.  If there's any damage they can charge against your deposit in accordance with the contract.    Where are you moving now?  If a new landlord ever calls to get references on you it will show that you moved out without paying your rent.  That's not a good idea.  If you rent from a reputable landlord (who doesn't want a suit in small claims court) and you kept the apartment up well, clean it when you leave and be polite you shouldn't have any problems with them.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Go to www.rentlaw.com and give that a try  good luck|`|CzNxbsmsaa	Go online and look up the state of CA.Landlord/tenant laws.Take a copy with you and make sure the landlord knows you're prepared to let a court settle the issue. Even if you're not!

Sounds like either A the paint will thicken like a slushy and hard to even work with , or will be frozen.|`|T5UBrKZjaa	I would very much recommend that you go to a paint store/home improvement/hardware store FIRST. Depending on where you live, climate, what the fence is made off....all these factors will lead to the success failure of your paint job. Yo might even have to prime coat first however, I would STRONGLY recommend that you don't paint in 5 degree weather. The paint will definitely not dry properly, leading to lack of adhesion to the fence, leading to MAJOR flaking pealing and cracking|`|vigFmfLmaa	The viscosity of paint changes at low temperatures.  It can separate and would be too thick to paint on.  Room temperature is the best to paint anything - goes on well and doesn't dry too fast.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	No it will just take longer to dry!

Lowes/Home Depot/Ben Moore/Sherman Williams/etc..|`|VPeb2fuTaa	You could decide on a color scheme for your room first (mine's red, white, and black) and go for things that match that scheme.  Pick a matching paint color first, then take a color sample with you to shop for that new comforter.  Or, if you're making the bedclothes and drapes yourself, most fabric stores offer swatches that you can take home to match to paint colors you find elsewhere.    Unfortunately, I don't know where you can match paint and fabric online.  But a low-tech solution is always better than none at all, right?
AA11070373	It very easy to cut a door down to 77 inches ,  get the shortest door 79 or 80 inch ,and cut off from the top and /or bottom  get it down to size , use a cutting guide on a circular saw so that you get a straight line , I do this all the time  it definitely saves on money and the time it takes to get a custom door  ordered, just check first to make sure that when you trim the door down you are not taking off too much of the frame , if you are doing this to a hollow core interior door   the piece you cut from the top or bottom can be used to strengthen the door by taking away the outer shell from the cut off piece and glued inside the the new shorter door so that it still has the same sold ends , if you are using a metal door cut it from the bottom then attach a new sweep along the bottom , and hey Presto you have made your own custom door at a fraction of the price ,|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	home depot|`|19b7bd1dd32149738cfd8fca874ffda8aa	Doors seldom fit straight from the shelf.

dCewrtXaaa	I have been painting rooms since I was 10, but I started with my mom supervising. As far as any mistakes you might make, that is part of the learning experience and they can easily be fixed. The truth is it could hardly be any worse than it already is, so what have they got to lose? Yes, you will have to strip off the wallpaper. You can't paint on top of it. And the idea about taking a free class at a store with your mom or dad is a good one. Then you can ask questions like about how to get the wallpaper off, how to use masking tape to protect the ceiling, etc. Congratulations on taking the initiative. Once they see how great it will look I think they will be thrilled that you tackled the project.|`|x0bTUKshaa	you need to get huge plastic covers and put all of your furniture in the middle of your room and cover them in the plastic covers! and put news paper or more plastic covers on the floor that way the carpet don't get paint on it. your have to talk to your parents and tell them they might can supervise them(if you want i know some parents will be "get that spot over there, get that the paint is running) and **** like that. i hoped this helped you!!!|`|kdksssi4aa	be honest and grown up when you talk to them.

74Ks1Mx9aa	Yes, tweezers can clog a toilet, I've pulled out many q-tips that are basically the same size and have stopped up the toilet. The problem is  that the tweezers can wedge themselves in the trap and become a blockage with the rest of the things that go into a toilet. A toilet auger will most likely clear your commode, a plunger would work temporarily, but once solid material was flushed, it would hang up on the tweezers again.|`|AYct1ZFRaa	Water may be able to get through but toilet paper can't..... it's probably clogged with toilet paper wrapped around the tweezers...... Sounds gross but do you have a plastic cup? it can cause suction to use as a plunger..... I have had to do it once (my sister loves to flush make up wipes.) Your best bet get a garbage bag and suction cup the toilet with your hand..... you will be able to pump it.....<br>  <br>  Pray you don't have to snake it.....|`|271d63aa0f46b41decb6d6a9f2574fadaa	Sure, water can go over tweezers, but what got hung up on the tweezers?  Probably they are stuck in the trap, and the only way to get them out, is most likely to take the toilet up, take it outside and get them out. You could try a toilet auger, maybe you can get them out with one of those. About $5.00 at a hardware store.|`|J6SPGeBvaa	It really depends on how much toilet paper you flushed. I would say that if they were to get stuck then it would be horizontally and then not much of anything big and solid has any chance of getting through
5aJ7t4hJaa	I *do* believe -- if one is referring to the operable valve on a water piping manifold whereby either cold water or hot water can be easily  accessed, if one lives in England -- one refers to the valve as a "tap" -- whereas, in the U.S.A. one would usually refer to the valve as a "faucet"!|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Different words for the same item.  a "tap" could also be a device for taking water, gas, etc. from a main line, such as for a refrigerator icemaker.|`|jieKgKF1aa	iam an australian and we use the word tap and america uses the word faucet,different words for the same thing.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	The Faucet is the whole unit in which you get your water from on the sink, taps are really the valves that are in the faucet,Spigot is another terms use for faucet and stop cocks is another term used for the valves|`|bFOcQeDCaa	If you were to tap into your knowledge you would come up with both being the same answer but don't faucet.|`|874EAxkfaa	farrah and dance

If it`s Black Mold you might want to pick up a newspaper and look for a new mailing  address.<br>  In the mean time you might want to get a spray bottle and fill it with bleach. Wrap something around your nose & mouth & spray moldy spots. The inspector can still take samples & identify them.|`|5rsN7VsUaa	Hi S,<br>  Is there a mold source that the mold inspector can swab and send to a lab? If the mold is growing behind your walls its 100% toxic. No sunlight and water = toxic conditions.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	you or your landlord would need to contact the Health Department and get an inspector to come to the apartment. you must be ready to move out while the mold is being cleaned as mold can cause respiratory issues. if the mold is only on the outside of surfaces you can use a bleach solution to clean it. also try airing out the apartment when you are home. mold loves dark, moist, warm places to grow.|`|uheIJLngaa	The mold inspector will have everything they need to do what they need to do for the inspection. Mold spores can be hazardous for people that don't know what they are doing. Usually bleach will kill it, you can use it full strength leaving windows open to help air out the smell. If the landlord is willing to deal with and pay for the treatment, let him. Mold can cause health problems and can make people very very sick. My husband & I spray bleach on mold when it starts up and usually takes more than one application. The inspector should be able to answer any questions you have, so don't be afraid to ask.|`|AA11563942	If you have an inspector coming, do not remove any evidence. Unless<br>  the inspector is days or weeks from coming then take detailed photos. And maybe some sample scrapings of the mold in ziploc bags. Documentation,Documentation, Documentation.
hNfOgNNBaa	Not sure but I do know that table grape growers use GA to plump the fruit- elongates it.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	You should read the side of the container. This will tell you what to use for each gallon of water. Giberellins are a plant hormone (almost like steroids) that force the plant to use more fertilizer thus forcing growth. Why are you using ferns as a subject? You should try flowering plants like geraniums to see how big and fast they grow. Ferns are somewhat slow growers and don't require a lot of light. I don't think you will see the growth in them as you would in flowering plants.

They grow in the form of a fall bulb, meaning if you want them in the spring months they have to be planted the fall prior. <br>  I am guessing that the flower you are holding is silk, or fake, because alliums rarely come in anything than shades of purple, blue and lavender.  Although if it is real you have found an amazing variety of this species.  Alluim can be expensive, because you only get one flowerball per bulb, (until the bulb gets older through the years and starts self dividing you may get more flowers).|`|MtrBaKk2aa	An Allium.|`|qsqmykzsaa	Maybe a hydrange flower.
fCF02V87aa	I would  suggest a tank-less.If sized properly they will save you money in the long run,,They take up little space--and are energy star rated. They cost more--but aren't pigs on electric like tanked water heaters.a solar system is still going to need a back-up.
LU6vfqRzaa	Most will because they contain some sort of oil.<br>  <br>  The only way to get it out is to pre treat area before washing.<br>  <br>  Spray and Wash<br>  some sort of stain stick<br>  or <br>  Oxy Clean <br>  or <br>  Grease Lightning.<br>  <br>  <br>  :-)
Oq5a5hRhaa	Stick them back in the washer and run it through the spin cycle (most washing machines will allow you to do spin only). This will get a lot of the water out. Then hang them back up. If you hang them inside after spinning, they shouldn't drip.
934c4252c52e9e1672bc305c32a6d996aa	Thats a great way to go! I used to have one of those. I made mine into an Amazon tank. I was trying to replicate the water of the Amazon River in the tropics of South America. The fish you mentioned in your question originate in the Amazon.I think you should start with guppies and neons which are also from the Amazon and are inexpensive fish. (Nix the goldfish idea here -they carry too many weird diseases and are dirty fish producing too much urine and excrement. And a dead goldfish can send your tank into very high ammonia, nitrate and nitrite levels.)  <br>       I bought a book at the New England Aquarium that has excellent photos and plans for all types of aquariums and it has excellent information! Like how to grow a African Cichlid Aquarium or an Amazon Aquarium and a few others. You might want to look for a book like that at the pet store, a book store etc.  <br>     I got a lot of information on how to make my Amazon Tank. The simple ingredient to create a Amazon Aquarium is a simple peat (tincture) solution that you add to the aquarium. Many quality pet stores have this in stock. You have to carefully add the right amount per gallon and make sure you monitor the pH. So you need a pH kit. The bottle of peat solution you buy will tell you what the pH should be and how frequently you add drops of the solution. This peat converts the water in your normal aquarium water into Amazon River water.  This water will have a light brown color like a light tea color. <br>  <br>      Part of the problem is the carbon in your filter removes this peat solution from the water and so you have to monitor it on a regular basis cause you don't want your pH to bounce all over the place.  So monitoring the pH is critical. But your fish that originate from the Amazon River will feel right at home and be healthier and thrive in this type of aqarium. Don't forget to add a few Amazon aquarium plants to help round out your tank. Also consider getting some fish tank drift wood to add to the realism of Amazon environment. I had a large piece in mine and my ruby tail shark loved to hang out inside a hole that went through it. Your ruby tail will eat the alegea that grows on the drift wood and you will get nice views of it on there.   Check with the pet store clerk to see if you can get that because it has to be the right kind for fish and its a great finishing touch for an Amazon environment.|`|J6Ksn0P7aa	The best thing to do is to find a great local pet store.  Go into a few and ask some pointed questions until you get some one who is willing to help you. Go to a local store and not a chain store as the local stores are more likey to have service people who know what they are talking about. <br>  <br>  But the best way to start is this:<br>  Fill the tank with tap water.  Add a dechlorination treatment like de-chlor according to packaging.  Let run and get it up to temperature for two days.  Go and buy a few cheap goldfish.  No more than 1 fish for every three gallons of water in your tank.  This will help season your tank and get the correct bacteria in the tank.  Change your water every week to a volume of at least a tenth of your tank.  Make sure that you use de-chlor treated water.  You may lose a few gold fish, but they only cost 25 cents right?  Have the goldfish in there for at least a month, then phase in, slowly your fish.  You pet store may want the gold fish back, or you can put them in an outdoor pond.<br>  <br>  As far as the pH goes you may want to use a specific substrate that helps buffer the pH to keep it from changing.  You most likely do not need to adjust it.  I used a special clay "soil" for my tank.  You want to stay away from using any pH adjusters until you are sure what the pH is, after your cycle with the goldfish. Even after the cycle add pH adjustment very slowly.  A little too much and you can lose your entire tank.

One night I was trying to prove him wrong so I smelled the armpit part of the shirt to see if it stuck(gross I know but oh well!) and it didn't smell at all. It smelled like his deodorant. I usually spray some sort of stain spray on them before I wash them and put them on the hottest setting they can go and add bleach to the washer. It will help fade the old stains and prevent new ones from appearing.

Allow for 2/3 overlap between rows.|`|6CyScIKBaa	1 square of shingles (3 bundles) covers 10 x 10 foot area|`|AA11563942	roofing is measured by the "square" which is 10ft by 10 ft, or 100 square feet. Three bundles to the square, or four bundles if you use architectural. At that price, I'm guessing that you are using non-architectural. So, figure 25 squares at 3 bundles per square. 75 bundles at $22+ is appr. 1650.00. But you have to figure for drip edge and felt and nails and ridge cap etc. Barring any problems with rot or damaged sheeting, you could do it yourself for less than 2k. If you have to tear off and dispose of the old stuff, then you have added cost.

zFZS4Aczaa	don't plant them in huge planters that are much bigger than the ones they are in now. get planters for them that are the next size up, if you will, to give them a little more room, but not much. their roots will spread to cover the area in the new planter, and after the roots, the above-ground parts of the plant that you see will catch up. then, if they need repotting again, get the next size up from that. plants don't do so well if you go with too big of planters too soon. i learned the hard way with that one. hope this tip helps you and good luck!|`|AA11498082	Plants don't need to be repotted until they become root bound -- you'll see the roots through (or coming out of) the drain holes.  Transplanting should not cause plants to die.  All pots should have drain holes so the plants don't sit in water and rot the roots.<br>  <br>  Are you giving them the same or similar lighting conditions as they had before?  Did you use root stimulator or similar fertilizer after repotting?  Knowing what the plants are would be helpful for more detailed answer.

If you poison them keep your pet away from the bait and any dead voles.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	My experience with them are that they will get into a house just as easily as a mouse.  Ways to prevent them around your yard are to clear away the debris around the trunks of the trees before it snows. This way they can't build up nests around their feeding sources.  This can still be done after it snows, but obviously its more work.  For next year, you can mow your lawn really short to shorten their supply of nesting materials.  As for inside the house, they fall for the same traps as mice do! Good Luck!
944iJNAdaa	Actually, many kinds of motors also work as generators, when they're powered by something else.  I've used 3-phase motors as generators, for example, for an off-grid power system (powered by a waterwheel, in my case).  Some people have made small generators using tape drive motors as generators, as another low-voltage example.  I think this really depends on what you mean by a generator - are you trying to just prove the concept, or are you trying to power a house with this?  The above poster is right, commercial generators aren't all that expensive, although I've paid a lot more than his stated $150 a kilowatt for a high quality diesel generator, and even a Honda engine powered one costs more than this.  Some people have converted car alternators to generate at 110 volts, too, and some have made these into automobile powered welders, too.  If it was the end of the world, we're surrounded by things that could be converted into generators.  It's too much easier and more efficient to just buy one instead, though, if that's what you're after.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Yes, but it is cheaper and much more efficient to buy a unit that is built and ready to use from a good manufacturer. <br>  To build one from the base up you need to build a solid base of non combustible material, wind the stator and the rotor and the field and also the feedback electronics to make the power.  Then you need something to make it spin which must be a steady speed.  All in all, you can buy a mid priced generator with a drive unit for about  150 dollars a kilowatt.  I doubt you can build one for that price in materials not counting your time.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Not really and you need a good response to electronics.

And not having hot enough water in the dishwasher is not getting your dishes clean either.<br>  <br>  I use those tablets and I have found that I get better results if I don't put them in the dispenser; it does take longer for them to dissolve properly.  I just chuck them in on top of the silverware basket where the spray hits them fully.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to turn up the water temp to the whole house, your dishwasher should have a setting on it that will heat the water it uses to wash.  Turn that on.  It will consume a bit more electricity but it's better than turning up the water temp for the entire house!

83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	I'd recommend using a speciality Citrus fertiliser,  and then feeding during the growing season.   Citrus plants can sometimes suffer a lack of all of the micro-nutrients that they need, in order to grow and fruit successfully.<br>  <br>  As it is flowering, I'm also wondering whether you've had any chilly weather around or just after that time, as this could cause the flowers/baby fruits to drop.  From your additional comment about splicing, most commercially sold citrus plants are grafted, as this gives the fruiting top variety the benefit of a stronger root system, some Limes are double grafted, with 2 different varieties grafted onto the root stock - this may be what you have too.  I guess that all of the parts of your plant are flowering at the same time, as otherwise this could cause a lack of pollination, even though your fruit will be seedless.<br>  <br>  Attract insects to your growing area with other plants, who will also have the opportunity to visit your lime.  Add other fragrant plants that will bloom at similar times of the year, and this should increase your successes, if it was a lack of pollination that caused your last season's issue.Otherwise, use a small paintbrush, and move pollen around between your Lime flowers,  to ensure that pollen is being received by the flowers in appropriate volume - assuming that your tree is small enough to do this completely, or to do a test patch of flowers.<br>  <br>  But, if watered and fed well, with good weather and sufficient pollination, especially Cross pollination, there isn't much more that you can do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck! Rob|`|mRfEHtPkaa	I think what I have read about this tree is you must strip all flowers and tiny fruits for the first two years.

pcEJMHPMaa	Start with fresh seeds dated for 2009 and purchase a mini greenhouse $10.comes with 12 pack container ,starter soil and plastic greenhouse cover.this is great time to start your plants so they can be healthy and strong enough when it is time to set in the ground.after the seedlings hit the top of the greenhouse cover, take the top off and continue growing.be mindful that peppers lke sun and don't let them dry out. Have fun and hope your peppers are plenty!|`|03sLrNPCaa	Sweet peppers are fairly easy to grow but take longer and are a bit fussier about germinating than most other vegetables.  Most experts recommend that you do not use peat for pepper germination.  One important fact you need to keep in mind, pepper seeds will not even germinate and may rot if the soil temperature is below about sixty degrees.  Optimum is around eighty degrees daytime and no less than seventy at night.  Plant them no more than 1/4 inch deep and don't<br>  over water.  Since they take a long time to sprout, water logged soil can cause them to rot before they sprout, as well.  They will tolerate more water once the seedling is up.  If you can, provide fourteen to sixteen hours of light per day until they have broken the soil.  If you want to use a starter fertilizer once they have true leaves, fine, but unless the soil is especially poor they usually won't need any more until transplant time or blossom set.  Even then, go easy on the nitrogen.  A balanced fertilizer blend will yield you more fruit rather than more plant.  Other than those suggestions, enjoy.|`|1bc954558a35cac62ae741987c1dd12eaa	Go to walmart and get one of those growing trays - seeds grow better in those peat moss pellets.  If you can afford it, get a growing lamp too - usually one that "imitates" sunlight (you'll see that when you get to the lightbulb area.  Follow the directions on the growing tray.  This gives the seeds an extra boost to grow good roots.  Unless, of course you're in warm weather area, then you can just sow it directly in the garden or in a pot.  If so, you can put a plastic "tent" over the seeds for a greenhouse effect - it boosts the seed germination process.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	never had much luck with bells from seeds even though my  hot pepper seeds did great.if you want to try from seed figure last freeze in your area then count back weeks from when plants go in ground which is 2 weeks after last freeze because peppers dont like cold.if at that time plants are not doing well go buy some nice seedlings.could also try some sweet banana peppers from seed-those went for me.most kinds of hot peppers did to.try putting down black plstic and then cutting holes in it and putting your seedlings in.this keeps weeds down,moisture in and it absorbs the suns heat.mulch around plant after 2 weeks.this worked wonders ,also for my tomatoes and eggplant

Vl4ZLrf5aa	There is no cheap alternative to framing.  You're right in that having posters laminated to foamcore is about as expensive as getting them framed in the first place....so is other alternatives I can think of for framing. What I would do is sign up to receive the circulars from a place like Michaels ...and use their 50% off coupons to buy a DIY frame kit ~ which the last time I bought one, was around $15 with coupon. As far as the glass (or plex, whatever you prefer) you can order a custom piece of glass to fit from any paint & glass. I prefer plex myself, and have purchased poster sized sheets for around $10-15 from a plexiglass distributor.    You can also hit the thrift stores, I see framed posters all the time for about $5. Simply toss the old poster, and replace with one of yours.

Also making your own frames is simple enough.. once again, go to a scrap yard and see if you can buy strips of aluminum or even thin strips of steel. Frames can be fashioned from them.

If it wasn't broken before you fixed it I guess you must have broken it.  Sometimes, especially with older wiring the slightest exposed nick is enough to blow the fuse.  Take it all apart again (after you make sure the power is turned off) and carefully examine the wires for cuts or cracks.  Tape the wire with a good electrical tape and replace the socket with another new one (38 cents by me) to be safe.|`|fPh7SrBSaa	I'll bet the wiring on the socket you did is either crossed (touching wires together) or wired backwards or something.

It sounds as though you may be best off calling an electrician; you may have to replace some wiring, which is a job best left to those who do it professionally. If the live wire is bunt open, then it may allow you to install a new fuse without blowing it, but still creates a fire hazard. Remove the fuse and call a pro.

AA11759897	Hi Pam.  Presumably the double switch is one for the boiler (water only) and the other is for the pump ( heating side ) you really need an electrician or a heating engineer to fit a programmer. probably looking at  120 up north or 160 down south, and a lot more if he comes on a horse. make sure you get an estimate first. Ps 1977  you should be saving up for a new boiler after 32 years of 24/7/365 days. what else lasts that long?   ( the average wife / husband only lasts about 12 yrs these days)|`|bxlYleZkaa	As the system is very old I would imagine it is on it's last legs anyway. I'd start saving for a new sytem rather than trying to update the old. Leave it as it is while it is working, or at least until the warmer weather!|`|nYRkAmdtaa	as above said the heating is controled by the stat on the wall turn that low enough and the heating does not fire on but you ought to get water . if 32 years old and still working stick with it .|`|7d023a65fe2a7fb214b1f3e00dafbd9faa	Hello, I am a boilermaker in the US of A. rather than guessing, the best advice I can give is to contact Baxi. Here is a link their contact page:    http://www.baxi.co.uk/contact.htm|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Your boiler is 32 years old and therefore will be requiring changing in the very near future, it would not be worth spending hundreds of pounds altering the system to have it individually timed, and it would most certainly require extensive pipe work alteration, you could have an immersion heater installed in your cylinder for  when you want hot water only and have a thermostat and combined timer this would solve the problem for the short while your boiler will have parts available, that's if they are still available now, for more information visit my website and use contact page, www.bennettsplumbingservices.co.uk|`|0CNaq92taa	Your system is probably what is known as a 4 pipe system.Two for the hot water[usually 28mm] and 2 for the heating[usually 22 mm]coming from the boiler.If so then the water works on gravity and is turned on by the stat on the boiler. The heating circulates via a pump ,which will be operated by one of the two switches,the second switch will be the feed too the boiler...If you leave the switches on then the heating can be switched on and off by the wall stat.Try turning the stat up and down, this should turn the pump on and off.|`|a0d479bcf01d683a05afe31fcc61a1e8aa	I have to say that 32 years is a long time to have one boiler I am presuming that it has been serviced every year .  But in either case I would actually have to say replace the boiler with a system that has a timer and one that does not have to be switched on to get water these news ones do not have a pilot light either so very economical to run|`|mHsvX7UWaa	Firstly start saving for a new boiler as this one is very in efficient.  Secondly, Instead of turning your system on and off with the thermostat, set it to 15 when you go out or go to bed and 20 -21 to when you need it warmer. This will stop the house getting too cold and hence warm up quicker. Heating hot water isn't really wasted because the heat is also going into your home. Fitting a programmer is fairly straight forward but would require control valves fitting into the pipework. Cost of having your system modified would be approx 300 which would be better saved towards your new boiler.

Pushing current through a resistance causes a voltage drop, and the dissipation of heat, thereby melting your plug and outlet.   Replace the outlet and the "Pigtail" as the cord is called.  There's probably nothing wrong with your dryer or your breaker.  The added resistance of a bad connection in series with the regular resistance of the dryer would have caused less current to flow in that leg than usual, which is why your breaker didn't trip.<br>  <br>  That is an old installation using a 3 prong plug.  New installations use a four prong plug requiring a non current bearing ground.  Dryers are not a balanced load, the L prong is the neutral leg which bears the return current from the timer motor, drum motor, and light if you have one.  The bulk of the current is used by the heating elements which travels in from one flat blade and back out the other flat blade.|`|spFmMOL2aa	the dryer, being electric and not gas, has to be costing you a lot.

I took the pillows back to the store and picked out 2 different pillows.  They smelled the same as the first ones.  The saleslady said the smell would eventually go away. I decided to speed up the process. The pillows were in plastic bags in the boxes. I took them out of the bags and placed them in cotton pillowcases with some dried lavender buds (wrapped in cheesecloth). After about 3 days they were lovely fresh smelling pillows and I have been using these pillows ever since. I use my lavender sachets on a regular basis.  I place them in my linen closet between sets of sheets and blankets.

Plus, if you're using granite tiles, there are tutorials on... either familyhandyman.com or diynetwork.com that show you how to lay the tiles with no grout lines- or teeny tiny ones. (The less grout to clean, the better!)     Good luck!|`|djmu98oUaa	I prefer Granite...  Most people considering a granite tile countertop realize its a natural stone product.  The density of granite causes it to be highly resistant to bacteria, making it an ideal material for kitchen countertops.  When you look at your granite tile countertop, you are looking at a combination of feldspar, quartz, and mica minerals; proportioned differently according to the granite. Each type of granite possesses different colors, textures, and structural features based upon these minerals.  At $60 to $100 per square foot, it makes sense to consider a granite tile countertop rather than one made from solid granite.
