No tienen reparos en utilizar minas quiebrapatas, cilindros de gas, explosivos, ya no solo contra los representantes del poder, sino contra la población que dicen defender. De tanto justificar el terror como medio de lucha, se quedaron solo en eso, ejercer el terror y tal vez ya no tienen claro para qué.

PDVSA realiza sus operaciones de procesamiento del crudo a través de 22 refinerías: tres complejos en Venezuela, y diecinueve en el resto del mundo.<br>  Del petróleo se obtienen muchos productos, desde gases y líquidos sumamente volátiles como la gasolina, hasta fluidos muy espesos como el asfalto y aun sólidos como la parafina o ceras. En líneas generales, los derivados básicos del petróleo son: gases, gasolina de motor, gasolina de aviación, kerosen, gasoil, diesel, solventes, bases lubricantes, parafina, combustible pesado (fuel oil) y asfalto.<br>  Además de esos productos básicos elaborados en instalaciones propias, la industria suministra materias primas a plantas petroquímicas y empresas manufactureras para producir caucho sintético, fibras sintéticas, fertilizantes, explosivos, insecticidas, medicinas, artículos de tocador y miles de otros productos. <br>  PDVSA es la TERCERA EMPRESA EN EL PROCESO DE REFINACIòN EN EL MUNDO, con una capacidad de procesamiento de petróleo de 3.3 millones de barriles por día. <br>  Refinerías<br>  En el territorio nacional, Petróleos de Venezuela CUENTA  con la REFINERIA MAS GRANDE DEL MUNDO: el Complejo Refinador Paraguaná (CRP), compuesto por las plantas de Amuay, Cardón y Bajo Grande. Ubicado en la península del mismo nombre, en el estado Falcón, este complejo tiene una capacidad de refinación de 940 mil barriles diarios (MBD).<br>  También se encuentran la refinería de Puerto La Cruz, con una capacidad de procesamiento de 200 MBD, y El Palito, que refina 130 mil barriles diarios.<br>  Fuera de sus fronteras, PDVSA cuenta con ocho refinerías en Estados Unidos, específicamente la de Corpus Christi, en Houston (Texas); Lemont, en Illinois; Paulsboro en New Jersey; Sweeny, Virginia; Lake Charles y Chalmette en Lousiana, y Savannah, en Georgia. <br>  En Europa PDVSA, gracias a la asociación con AB Nyn?s y a través de las refinerías de Nynasshamn en Suecia y Antwerp en Bélgica, así como de las ubicadas en  el Reino Unido (específicamente en Dundee, Escocia, y Eastham, en Inglaterra).<br>  Además, PDVSA cuenta con una capacidad de procesamiento de 608 mil barriles diarios en las refinerías ubicadas en el Caribe, específicamente el caso de Isla, en Curazao; que procesa 335 MBD y St. Croix (Bahamas).<br>  <br>   Acaso el COMPLEJO REFINADOR DE PARAGUANà no es el màs GRANDE DEL MUNDO?<br>  Dices que se esta quemando con fuego?

Solo analiza, si los paises de la OPEP tienen que aumentar su produccion para abastecer al imperio, a cunato crees que suba el barril de petroleo?

Y también que antre la falta de demanda de EEUU Venezuela deberá acudir con su petróleo que pueda refinar en todas las refinerías mencionadas por la Caraque?a (excluyendo las tantas ubicadas en USA) y su abundante pero complicado crudo a otros compradores lo cual en alguna medida compensaría la crisis de oferta que pronostica Abraham, sin duda más a costa de Venezuela que de EEUU.<br>  <br>  Más allá de ésto, es obvio que Chavez juega con fuego no sólo en este episodio en particular que ata?e directamente a los EEUU, sino que con todos sus delirios socialistas revolucionarios juega con el porvenir mismo de América Latina, lo que es peor con la colaboración y aprovechamiento (Ej. matrimonio Kirchner, Lula, Evo Morales en forma titiritesca, Fidel Castro, etc...)  de otros mandatarios de la región.<br>  <br>  En mi opinión, hoy por hoy (ya que cada tanto se inventa una nueva) es más peligroso su apoyo al terrorismo Colombiano y su sed de guerra contra ese pais (que también se mencionan en las respuestas anteriores) que la alharaca contra EEUU que ejercita a diario y que hasta ahora ni siquiera movió al último a una respuesta.<br>  <br>  Es esperanzador que haya perdido el plebiscito para obtener la reelección en su propio país y que las encuestas de opinión más serias muestran que su popularidad en Venezuela es hoy por hoy del 21%.|`|32104098d2dcb8f9944d2181703934abaa	Que se queme!!!...que se queme!!!...que se queme!!!!|`|4nbHqO0haa	ay grecia pero por DIOS por gente kmo tu esq esos yanquies c han fortalecido si ya sta comprobado q son ellos los q necesitan d los demas solo q c disfrazan  d super heroes q quieren salvar al planeta y los villanos quienes son? m ira mas aya d tu nariz acaso esq solo ellos tyienen tecnologia? pues no mamacita aqui tambien hay y sta despertando el pueblo y c sta capacitando y ese esel dolor d los gringos q creen q si ellos no seremos pues dejam,e decirt q SI SE PUEDE wsino es x el momento puies q c detenga las perforaciones mientras c consiga 1 solucion hasta seria mejor y d la economia acaso el dolar noes el q manda sobre todas las monedas? xq si venezuela tiene tanto petroleo kmo esq su moneda en4el extrangero no vale ah no es x culpa d chavez noooo mnamita a otro perro con ese hueso es xq los gringos ,lo  dicen pero x poco tiempo xq todo loq sube baja asi q bajate d esa nube mamita xq t vas a deco?etar ja jaja q chavez c va quemar? c t quemaron las neuronas q tenias ni?ita esclava del imperio yanquee ok quieres mas  sigue q a mi tamb m gusta|`|BJuwdg4faa	Personalmente creo que Chavez tiene las horas contadas y eso le debe producir terror, angustia, stress, paranoia, bloqueo moral, etc...<br>  Por lo demas, se que tienes razon, y hay otros muchos malos negocios de Chavez que nos tienen jodidos.|`|HKSgpSA2aa	yo ya lo veo bastante tostadito,un golpe mas de horno y listo|`|MFqfNxBMaa	Amiga Grecia voy a tratar de responder tu pregunta de modo que no te quede una duda,  1ro el petroleo de Vzla se refina el el pais y el que se refina en  EEUU va a CITGO  una filial de PDVSA en ese pais, en el caso venezuela lo que hay es un proceso que lejos de beneficiar al venezolano lo afecta en todos los sentidos. porque Chavez vive en un eterno conflicto con todos y porque usa el supuesto "Nacionalismo" para atacar todo lo que vaya en contra de su "revolucion" pero  el verdadero fin de sea revolucion es atornillarse en el poder el y sus acolitos. pero ahondando mas en el asunto petrolero venezuela hoy por hoy es uno de los paises mas ricos del mundo, pero esa riqueza solo la obstenta el que trabaja directamente con Chavez el resto se J*** lo que demuestra los mas altos niveles de corrupcion en el mundo, puesto que no hay un solo preso por malos manejos de dinero Publico ni lo habra ya que la justicia de este pais es una prostituta que se vende al mejor pagador y la mal llamada oposicion al gobierno lo unico que plantea es que la salida de chavez de una y/o otra forma. sin percatarse que en su eterno conflicto los venezolanos arrastran despues de 9 a?os de revolucion, los mismos problemas de antes y con la agravante de que chavez en su afan de mantenerse en el poder esta abierto a la posibilidad de una guerra con colombia,  puesto que esta situacion eliminaria cualquier eleccion a futuro y al estar el pais en guerra quien tiene el poder ? exacto los militares y chavez que es? militar.

Es por asi decirlo una perpetuacion del paternalismo nocivo de nuestras sociedades postcoloniales.  En cuanto a las FARC supe de la protesta mundial hasta que ya sucedio pero tambien me sumo a la misma. Aqui en Guatemala gracias a los comunistas europeos, la izquierda se encargo en desarmar el estado de seguridad y por eso es que ahora Guatemala se constituye en la nueva Colombia de la epoca de Pablo Escobar (solo que aqui son un monton de carteles los que se disputan el poder). Creo que eres colombiano y sabes perfectamente lo nefasto que es tener crimen organizado incrustado en todas las esferas de las sociedad, peque?o detalle que los populistas de Chavez olvida.

Es desprestigio del buen capitalismo que ha caido en la euforia y prepotencia.

Si estudiaramos profundamente las premisas del capitalismo europeo, nos dieramos cuenta que son una estructura mesclada donde se ha estado incluyendo en los programas, estructuras de ambos sistemas. el viejo continente se ha tomado mnas tiempo en estudiar que es lo mejor para ellos, sin embargo aqui en America Latina, las revoluciones son mas expontaneas pero como es natural, cuando alguien se esta ahogando de cualquier palo se agarra.

tn0GyqTaaa	"Creeis que es ético y hasta positivo las consecuencias derivadas de cualquiera de las dictaduras a las que el planeta ha sido testigo?"<br>  <br>  Respuesta: Las consecuencias no pueden ser calificadas de éticas o no éticas. Sólo las conductas pueden ser objeto de tal juicio.<br>  <br>  "?Vale la pena conseguir algo que se considera justo si a cambio hay que dejar por medio familias rotas, viudas, huerfanos, un país dividio, etc?"<br>  <br>  Respuesta: Depende de que la consideración de que una norma o política sea justa, coincida efectivamente con la justicia.<br>  <br>  Supongamos que hay una invasión a tu país. Lo justo es que el Estado tome medidas para defenderse, lo cual podría implicar que ponga en activo a su ejército. Esto, naturalmente, podría causar que algunos soldados murieran, y por ende ocasionaría familias rotas, viudas, huérfanos, etc. Sin embargo, su sacrificio fue justo y necesario para que el Estado cumpliera su función. Es una desgracia, pero así son las cosas.<br>  <br>  Te puedo decir entonces que afirmar a priori que las consecuencias de las dictaduras son universalmente nocivas sería una conclusión demasiado apresurada, y sobre todo, limitada a unos pocos campos -- importantes eso sí --de la vida del ser humano. <br>  <br>  Es verdad que históricamente las dictaduras han aplastado los derechos humanos.

Lease la Constitucion de ese Estado, la palabra democracia se fue de vacaciones, es desconocida para ellos, en las varias enmiendas se omite.<br>  Invades, violas, torturas, manipulas y matas, hasta tu propio presidente, pero con una simple oracion y un sacrificio "ya ofrecido",  la propia victima, expias tus culpas y ya. Es eso moral y etico? <br>  Cual es la moral de las empresas trasnacionales..Exxon Mobil y su Exxon Valdes, Hallybourton, Squibb, Merck Sharp Dome, IBM,  Kellogs, Coca y Pepsi, Procter, General Motors, Beechcraf, ITT, Adidas, etc..etc estas se retiran de los paises donde operan sin indemnizar a los trabajadores, aun cuando les pagan sueldos de subsistencia, es decir miseros. <br>  En el area donde operan estas empresas siempre hay un cordón de hambre y miseria, será etico y moral que trabajen mas de doce horas diarias, se vendan en otros paises esos productos a un precio 100 veces lo que le pagan a estos subocupados. <br>  Y cuando se tornan viejos estos trabajadores, se retiran del pais, olvidando que le deben prestaciones, llevandose sus pensiones.<br>  Los golpes se generan cuando los gobernantes serios, con principios, con cierta moral y etica, se oponen, entonces utilizan ese poder economico, para desplazar gobernantes bajo cualquier forma. Ejemplo tendriamos Argentina, con Menen y Vilela, Chile con Pinochet y la muerte de Allende, en Panama la matanza en el barrio pobre de El Chorrillo donde asesinaron a mas de 30 mil personas, se dice que las personas se "derretian", Irak, Sha de Persia, Ayatollah y Hussein, las masacres contra el pueblo Palestino (mujeres y ni?os), por parte de los Gobiernos Semitistas de IsraeI, actualmente se busca invadir y atacar a los gobiernos que tienden a tomar medidas internas para proteger sus pueblos, se les tilda de "TERRORISTAS"  y enemigos del pueblo de EEUU, cuando solo se trata de medidas internas.

El empleo y el trabajar de ninguna manera es indigno y no es explotación en la mayoría de los casos ya que la gente acepta un sueldo por su trabajo y a nadie se le obliga a trabajar con determinada empresa si no quiere. Todos necesitamos una fuente de ingresos y los únicos que pueden darnosla son los que tienen una empresa o en su defecto tomar una plaza del gobierno, pero finalmente el caso es el mismo. Una persona ociosa no hace nada bueno de su vida. Y si no trabaja a que se va a dedicar ?a asaltar en los microbuses a la gente que si trabaja?.... el trabajo ennoblece... Y por otra parte quien tiene una empresa antes fue empleado, en la gran mayoría de los casos y los que somos empleados también deseamos hacernos de capital y tener una empresa y contratar empleados. ?si o no?.... discúlpame pero tu planteamiento es absurdo pues según tu filosofía entonces no vendría al caso estudiar nada... lo mismo daría ser analfabeta si finalmente no vas a trabajar en ningun lado. Hasta el comercio informal contrata empleados.... y siempre hay un jefe y todo mundo quiere ser el jefe... y tener empleados... como ves, todo da vuelta sobre lo mismo<br>  <br>  YO TAMBIEN SOY ARTISTA ?Y QUE CON ESO?.... SI NO TENGO QUIEN COMPRE O NO SE LO VENDO PARA QUE NO ME "EXPLOTE" YA NO VOY A PODER SEGUIR SIENDO ARTISTA PORQUE NO VOY A TENER CON QUE COMER Y CON QUE COMPRAR LOS MATERIALES PARA SEGUIR HACIENDO MI OBRA..... Y QUE CREES? PARA HACER LO QUE YO HAGO NECESITO CONTRATAR EMPLEADOS ?Y YA POR ESO SOY UNA EXPLOTADORA?... me parece que estás como que muy amargado|`|r6j1rgWkaa	Tienes toda la razon es prostitucion y sobre todo ahora que además hay una superexplotacion.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Una cosa es la prostitución y otra muy diferente trabajar para otra persona. <br>  <br>  Yo estudié para ser profesional y por ende tengo que trabajar en el medio para lo cual estudie y tratar de crecer profesionalmente y si llegase la oportunidad de independizarme lo haré...pero no es prostitución jeje como me dio risa esto. <br>  <br>  Te felicito que eres artista, pero un artista tiene delicadeza, sentimientos sublimes, romanticismo, y por sobre todas las cosas......entendimiento y SENSIBILIDAD!!!!<br>  <br>  Una cosa son tus ideas personales y las respeto, pero otra que digas que el trabajar para otros es ser prostitutas o prostitutos jje que risa....lo diras porque tu tienes una profesión que te da para trabajar tu solo...pero en mi caso como te escribí, para codearme, foguearme en el medio del poder judicial tengo que trabajar con muchas personas y no sola, así, que tu pregunta está mal formulada.<br>  <br>  También una cosa es la EXPLOTACIóN DEL HOMBRE y otra muy diferente pertenecer a una empresa, compa?ía, Institución o un Organismo Público para crecer profesionalmente y otra lo que escribes...el tiempo de la esclavitud ya pasó, pero sé que existen aún empresas que explotan a sus trabajadores y para ejemplo ahí tienes a USA como abusa con sus trabajadores latinos.

VYtW0uRiaa	Alexis,it has never worked as a social system. Ask Cuba's people,China's people .|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Because communism is an economic system.|`|DCypNvVEaa	It doesn't.<br>  <br>  Communism is a political/economic system (broadly, that makes it a social system--and it does not work. Period).<br>  <br>  The political dimension isn't the key.  Communist governments are straightforward dictatorships.  They may be stable for a time, but any dictatorship is unstable in the long run.<br>  <br>  The defining feature of Communism is the economic system.  It is predicated on abolishing the market system, private property, and giving the state total control of the means of production and distribution.<br>  <br>  Besides stripping the citizensof their liberty and human rights, this also removes any incentives for innovation, hard work, etc.  The only remaining incentive is simple survival--but any effort to achieve more is pointless, since there is no reward for doing so (unless you happen to e one of the Party favorites.<br>  <br>  So the system, besides losing the efficiencies of market economies, inevitably results in low productivity, innovation, etc.<br>  <br>  The only time a Communist regime prospers is if there is some external factor proppping it up.  Take Cuba (its about as close to being "prosperous" as any Communist society has ever been).  But Cuba has a multi-billion sugar crop export each year--and with a population of only about 10 million, that's enough to shore up their economy.<br>  <br>  Now, if you are thinking that communism leads to social equality--hardly.  In that it is an abysmal failure.  In the Soviet Union, for example, religious people (especially Jews) were persecuted.  People with disabilities were institutioonalized and shipped off to remote areas out of sight, so as to not sullly the image of the "worker's paradise."  And of course, all tthe Party elite had their dachas (resort mansions) on the Black Sea. . . . .and no one not "approved" had any oppportunity advance themselves.

That's right President Bush is more popular then the DEMOCRAT CONGRESS. Ronald McDonald could have been on the Democrat's Presidential ballot and would have won. If you don't believe me just based on Congress then look at some of the other votes. Prop 8 in California to put an amendment on their State Constitution that says marriage is between one man and one woman passed. So at the same time we were supposedly saying we wanted to "heal" we were "cutting" ourselves. Does that make sense? Only if you consider the ENTIRE picture. That is that people wanted Democrats in office. Well in 2 years we'll see how that turns out when people don't want them there.|`|YupMCYHlaa	I don't know about Europe. I have spent time in Canada and I find them not quite as racist as the US, on the whole, but racism is certainly alive and well in both countries.  Canada elected a French-Canadian prime minister some years ago, and they are a minority.  I think they might elect a black man if a good specimen came along, like Obama.  Years ago I would have bet good money that Canada would elect a black leader before the US would.<br>  <br>  As for Europe, I remember reading in Maya Angelou's autobiography that she moved to France because she perceived there was no racism there, black people from Senegal seemed to have full rights, so she thought it would be a good place to send her son to school.  But once there she found there was racism, it was just more covert than here.  She said even in Africa the lighter-skinned blacks were the hotel clerks and managers while the darker-skinned ones carried the bags and mopped the floors.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Europe isn't racist at all.

bwEVh8qmaa	These are different times, and Obama is the real deal.  McCain cannot win on the issues, so nothing is left for him to do but use smear tactics.  Middle class America's concerned about their children's future; they think they'll have a fighting chance with Obama.  I personally don't care about Ayers; I know he acted a fool back in the day, but now he's a respectable college professor and seems to have rehabilitated himself.  I don't put too much faith in who Rev. Sharpton supports.  I dare say he and Obama are miles apart on a great many things.  Also, I believe Rev. Wright was wrong to publicly make those intolerant statements.  I know he came through times when racism was rampant, but it was bad judgment to publicize his anger; it could have hurt Obama's campaign.|`|k6hicodfaa	It's the economy.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Kerry did two things wrong, he left on vacation after his convention, thinking that no one would belive the lies, and he didn't strike back quickly so they had time to settle in, no one outside his state really knew him.<br>  Obama is a known quantity, we have seen him over twenty months debate, appear, discussed, and dissected in our living rooms.<br>  Its too late to make him appear a wild eyed raving liberal.<br>  If anything the raver seems to be McCain himself, hes rushing to the financial crisis, suspending his campaign, appearing on Letterman, then standing Letterman up for Couric, then not even going to DC until the next day.  His leadership couldn't even get the bailout bill passed.<br>  With his own party. His wandering though the second debate was the stuff comedians look for, and he did seem lost.<br>  And I'm not his friend.<br>  The ties to Ayers are infinitesimal.  They served on a board, The Annenberg Connection, for educaton, Ayers is a professor, so was Obama.  They live in the same neighborhood.  The board is not made up of two people,  its a respected organization named for a leading Republican family,there isn't any evidence they did anything remotely unrelated to education.  Its the stuff smears are made of, but there is nothing other than McCarthyism at work here.<br>  People were  swayed before, maybe they learned something.<br>  Maybe they aren't as gullible.<br>  Except here, where some still think Obama was born in Kenya, and hes a Muslim and an Arab.  Never underestimate how gullible some people are when it suits them.|`|fbeba5dc300a1f4a43941be04a82654aaa	Well, it you call a failure of the press to ask the legitimite questons about his association with Ayers, and FAnnie mae and Mac's crooks and Acorn who he got a million dollars for smears, well then I don't know,  But todays' Gallop went from 11 to 7, RAsumssen wehnt from 7 to 5 and jZogty went from 6 to 5.  This is even with Accron producing as may fraudleent votes as they can.  Why did Obama hire Accron to register voters.  Why did the the Dallas football team end u being registered as voters in Nevada? Why does the Congress not investigagge Johnson and Raines who brought down Frddie mac and Mae.  Why did Obama receive the 2nd largest lobbyist contribution from these organizations? How much more do your want.   The real crime is the ignoring of facts on the part of Obama supporters and the press.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	It's a growing trend amongst Americans.  We are wising up to Republican B.S.  That was the message of the 2006 mid-term elections.  <br>  <br>  If Republicans want our votes, they need to campaign on how they plan to fix our problems because Americans don't believe they have the answers anymore.  Attack ads and smear tactics do nothing to restore Americans' faith in the Republican agenda.

That didn't work, and they didn't get to face Hillary, so now it seems like everything is old, irrelevant, and intellectually bankrupt, at least for the more undecided voters. The people who are affected by the current smears are mostly people who were going to vote McCain, anyway. The Rezko thing never sticks, enough people know about his middle name, the Muslim thing has been vastly debunked as people have become more educated about the candidates, the Wright thing is old and boring, the Ayers thing actually backfired on McCain/Palin as it was pointed out that they were putting the economy in the rear-view mirror.|`|Jd6ojhpvaa	The smears are working.  The polls are tightenning.  The polls don't wanna be wrong.  As we get closer to election day the polls will get closer.  The pollsters will be much more careful about who they are polling.

I've always considered Obama just slightly left of center and a moderate.  Bill Clinton I always considered right of center.  So, exactly who are you talking about when you talk about extremists in the Democratic party.  If you say Pelosi or Reid, then I have to say you have no idea what you're talking about.  <br>  <br>  We're in an economic crisis of the century.  What did you expect him to address during this time? Seriously,  Most people on the street (or on Yahoo Answers) have no clue as what's coming to hit them.  They may sense something is going down but they don't really have a clue because most people aren't concerned with being informed.  If anyone thinks things are going to be just groovy in a year then they are in for a huge surprise of their life.  To get this country moving again will require massive spending to get people working. Which is what the government will have to do because private industry isn't spending anything.  The economy and the banks are frozen.  No one is spending.  That's the only way demand is going to be created to get the economy going again.  Ultimately, it will create larger deficits.  But during horrible economic times the Government has to be the institution to start the economy.  During the good times is when that national debt can be paid off through higher revenues and lower interest.  Good ole Keynsian economics still rules.|`|x6XOcWHGaa	I'm kind of surprised to hear you voted for McCain, Libby... that's, not very progressive of you. You always struck me as a groovy liberal prog chick, especially judging from the new Caravan avatar. :P<br>  <br>  But anyway, I'm glad to hear you're starting to like Obama, though I don't get what there was to dislike in the first place. He always said that the economy was of the utmost importance (oh, and he's not going to continue that fail of a war in Iraq indefinitely, but that's another issue...), and where people pull this, "he's an extreme leftist/socialist/muslim/terrorist/baby eater!" etc. **** from is *******... beyond logic... (not that you've said all that :P) and as far as "Goodies and Special Interests..." how do you even know he'll be that kind of president? Maybe he's actually not corrupt, people who dislike the guy are basing all of this **** off of some vague "feeling" they have about the guy... or that they don't know him as well as John McCain, and you know the old redneck saying, "the devil you know is better than the devil you don't"... or something like that...<br>  <br>  At any rate... I don't see any reason to believe he wasn't always moderate, he's always on about reaching across party lines... perhaps he was telling the truth! :O Shocker! But again, I'm glad you're the kind of person who realizes that, once we have a president, you've gotta hope he does well and not be bitter about your candidate not winning. The whole reason for wanting a certain candidate is because you think that's what's best for America, after all.
0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	It is probably very unfair to blame the auto industry's problems on labor contracts.  First it must be noted that those contracts were entered into by the executives who run the companies.  When these companies were selling cars they didn't matter much.  Actually labor costs in this era of automation are a small part of the cost of a car.  Japanese and European carmakers also produce their products in unionized plants.  Detroit has moved a lot of their production into Canada because Canada's nationalized healthcare lowers their production costs.  Blaming unions is just a typical screed that we hear from the right wing.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Yes, because most of the "Japanese" cars we buy are made in the US by workers who make less than the workers at the Big 3.  Today, auto manufacturing is simply not as valuable a skill on the market as it was 20 years ago.  The pay scale is much lower, and the Big 3 must adapt or die.<br>  <br>  GM is still #1 in sales.  Ford is around # 3 or 4.  That's in the WORLD, so sales is not the issue.  It's labor expense, particularly legacy PENSION debt from back when they paid workers even more than today.  They may have to go bankrupt just to offload that debt.  Not good for the retirees, but it may be the only way the companies can survive.|`|UvCA6ajZaa	The mob needs to get their hands off.<br>  The oil comanies and car companies are obviously in it together.

That's as much of a problem as their high overhead costs.|`|vQxStqR2aa	Labor costs. Japanese costs are about half the UAW costs which is why costs of cars as well as maintance is high. For years when things were going well the UAW would want bigger share of the pie which the auto makers were ok with because they had the money & wanted to avoid strikes & bad press but then SUVs become evil and american makers continued to lose market share to foreign cars which tended to last longer over all & between mantaince as well as be cheaper throughout & not the american makers are still paying the higher labor without selling as many let alone as many lucritive SUVs and other profitable cars so the money isnt there anymore. Its bad policies on both sides & why I dont think they should be bailed out. ITs the ultimate showing of Greed even now the UAW refuses to take cuts instead of going to what the "standard" rate would be.|`|65w12kBdaa	Toyota and  Volkswagon have large plants here, in the US.   Their jobs are filled by American workers in the US plants.<br>  <br>  So the theory you suggest about health care and labor agreements does not fly.<br>  <br>  Sales are down, the demand for what Ford and GM has to offer is down.

The way the Japanese companies treat their employees is that they consider them an asset.  In fact it is a disgrace to the  company if an employee leaves and they often consider the employee to have a job for life.  The auto industry and many other American industries consider them an expense that they need to control.   Probably one of the best things is that changes and improvement suggestions are given by the rank and file and moved up the management ladder, not down.  They also manage by goals and leave their people to change the way they do things without getting dozens of approvals and such.  I worked in the US for a Japanese auto maker about 20 years ago.  They introduced a new state of the art car security system which eventually made it to I think all of their models.  What isn't known outside the company is that it was a relatively simple design developed by a computer programmer working on a business application and not even near the auto engineers.  You don't see anything near that with American auto companies.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	No.  The Big Three have been out of touch for decades.  Their problems go far beyond labor contracts.  These are the companies that fought tooth and nail against padded dash boards, seat belts, air bags, mileage standards and building the kind of cars Americans really wanted.  The Big Three stink from the top down.  These were management decisions that screwed the companies.

vHpI0M41aa	There are many, many things about Obama that make me uncomfortable.  We, as a nation, have yet to learn what he is and what he will do to our nation.  It was a known fact before he was elected that he had been paid off by many questionable entities.  But I'm sure his sheeple will continue to believe the slick, glib answers he feeds them.|`|S3ktbzDNaa	Obama received the vast majority of his money from low level employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who have just as much right to give to him as anyone else and no power to influence anything. The decision makers (Officers, Directors, and Lobbyists) gave 10-1 to John McCain over Obama (161,000 to 16,000).|`|4iAMrHd1aa	YES!  <br>  <br>  What is the quid pro quo that will happen once he's in office? That's why an investigation is necessary.  A special prosecutor should be appointed to uncover the corruption in ALL of Obama's money matters, certainly.  <br>  <br>  What  worries me most is the untold millions in illegal money from overseas.  |`|xBfwhAQxaa	Now, I was under the impression, because I listened to Senator Obama during the campaign, that he's only going to raise taxes on the rich, 'cause they've got it. They don't need it. They have more than they need. They can afford it. So he needs to raise taxes on the rich and cut taxes on the, quote, unquote, "middle class."  So he wants economic recovery to bubble up from the bottom or whatever, which is very tough to do when you're at the bottom and you're broke.  I don't know how you bubble anything up when you're broke, but that's not the point.  I have a story here from AP-Obama, and it's about three Colorado ski resorts being "forced" to lay off workers.  (gasping)  It's from the Durango Herald.  We read the Durango Herald every day here.  It's part of our show prep rotation.  (laughing) It might embarrass them so much they go out of business.  <br>  <br>  "This ski season is shaping up to be the worst in years, said a Canadian ski-resort company that has announced it has laid off workers across a dozen resorts, including three in Colorado.  Vancouver-based Intrawest Corp. hasn't said exactly how many workers it let go, but company officials say the weak economy is squeezing the ski business." Now, who is it that goes out to Colorado and skis?  No, it's not the poor.  The poor are working in the hotels.  The poor are working in the restaurants, the, quote, unquote, poor.  The poor are working at the ski resorts where the rich are not going because the economy is cutting into their disposable income and they think that they've got tax increases coming.  <br>  <br>  "Colorado's Steamboat Ski & Resort, for example, is more than three hours by car from Denver. Because of that, most visitors fly in and stay several days, while smaller resorts closer to big cities have an easier time surviving a poor economy.  'They're not as dependent on out-of- state and international visitors,' Dave Belin, director at Boulder-based research firm RRC Associates, told the Rocky Mountain News. In a survey of skiers conducted online last month, RRC found that most skiers planned to ski as often as last year. But they planned to cut back in other ways -- on lodging, lessons and other extras such as traveling a long way to get to a ski mountain."  See, I thought tax increases and other trivial income killers amounted to chump change to wealthy Americans.  But this is what I told you, and this is the main reason I said we gotta support Senator McCain, in fact, because of his tax policy was right.  <br>  <br>  Every time you hear Obama or some Democrat talking about raising taxes on the rich to help the little guy, it's the little guy that gets shafted, and this ski resort story is a classic example.  So we have to take the wealthy down a notch or two.  How could that hurt anybody?  Why, that couldn't hurt anybody!  We gotta take the wealthy down a notch or two.  They give up a little chump change, Obama can spend it on welfare checks for those who don't pay income taxes, and life is good for everybody!  Except raising taxes is not chump change to rich people.  That was just Obama shooting his mouth off.  It turns out when the wealthy are pummeled by bad economic news of any kind they pull back, too.  Nothing is chump change, and so now they're going to visit ski resorts less.  And when they, the people that pay the freight by going skiing go less or don't stay overnight in hotels and so forth the ski resorts, three of them owned by a Canadian firm, are laying off the little guy, the guy who's supposed to benefit from tax increases on the rich.  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  END TRANSCRIPT<br>   <br>  <br>  Read the Background Material...<br>  <br>  ?

cb1d5eb8ef6d45defc8e354f3870d037aa	It is paradoxical. Most Democrats dont believe in God, forget Christ Himself. Yet they are quick to invoke Christ when they want desire increased taxes (which is always) and governmental control over lives, citing poorly extrapolated reasoning like "Jesus was a socialist" or "Jesus gave to the poor", "WWJD".<br>  They are hypocritical.

It is no longer the<br>  Democratic Party we used to know;  in fact, my entire family have been<br>  Democrats, but NOT ANY MORE.  WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT<br>  ANTI-AMERICAN, WE ARE NOT LIBERAL NUTJOBS WHO WANT<br>  OUR KINDERGARTENERS TAUGHT HOW TO MASTERBATE, AND<br>  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN SOCIALISM OR COMMUNISM.  This is<br>  what the Liberal new Democratic party is about and who they are.<br>  <br>  Understand that they have adopted the Democratic party because they<br>  have a perfect "front" there.  Obama used to teach classes on how<br>  to be a successful radical, and he followed the Saul Alinsky model<br>  called "Rules for Radicals" which was dedicated to Lucifer.<br>  Obama taught that the best way to usher in socialism is under the<br>  guise of the Democrats who are "easy pickins" because while they are so busy saving the whales, the real agenda of Obama, Ayers, Farraghkhan, Wright, Pflegler and others can be moved forward.<br>  Also, generally people think they know who the Democratic party is,<br>  so when they make radical inside changes to it, and still keep the name, nobody will be any the wiser.<br>  <br>  Also note that it is only since Obama came on the scene that you<br>  see religion coming forth from these liberals - THEY WANT THE EVANGELICAL VOTE AND THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET IT,<br>  EVEN GOD HELP THEM, PRAY FOR IT PUBLICALLY.<br>  <br>  If you have a group who hates Elm trees, Obama will profess his hatred<br>  of Elms;  if your group hates jews, he will profess to support the PLO.<br>  Hate Palestine? No problem - Obama will talk about his problems with<br>  the jews.  Are you pro abortion? Obama will make abortion available to you RIGHT UP UNTIL LABOR BEGINS. He will do anything and say anything to get elected.  ALLOW ME TO BE CLEAR:<br>  <br>  BARACK OBAMA WILL BE ANYTHING AND SAY ANYTHING THAT YOUR EARS WISH TO HEAR, JUST AS LONG AS YOU VOTE FOR<br>  HIM.  Then when he is elected, people will find out what they have<br>  actually done.  OBAMA IS NOT A CHRISTIAN.  OBAMA IS A FRAUD<br>  EXTRAORDINAIRE....The reason he stayed in the Black radical church<br>  with Rev Wright so long is because he said himself he was studying how to hype up a crowd and then harnass the energy into a radical<br>  thug group CALLED ACORN.

It's right there, in the Bible, the first utopia society of the first century Christianity, they brought all their goods in common, and that didn't work at all! The bringing of all assets in common, might seem like a noble idea, and all, but it's flawed by the very thought that generated that ideology. You see, humans have always tried to deal in some ways with the issue of "personal responsibility" thus they made this common thing really appealing. What's more noble than to take care of a needy person? But in that, you would make it a community effort, and you would be not burdened to make that your responsibility This is where the flaw is. And if it didn't work in a 100 percent Christian community, what makes anyone thing it will work in a mixed society, or much less, non-christian??? I would love to hear, if someone would tell me what underlying motivation does a non-believer in Christ, or in God have to actually keep caring/ providing for the other fellow who is less endowed in one or all aspects?

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.'" Matthew 19:23-24<br>  <br>  "The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it an unscalable wall." Proverbs 18:11<br>  <br>  "There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land." Deuteronomy 15:11<br>  <br>  "Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life." 1 Timothy 6:17-19<br>  <br>  "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least among you, you did not do for me.'" Matthew 25:41-45<br>  <br>  "People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs." 1 Timothy 6:9-10<br>  <br>  "Rich and poor have this in common: The LORD is the Maker of them all." Proverbs 22:2<br>  <br>  "No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money." Matthew 6:24<br>  <br>  "Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle." Proverbs 23:4-5<br>  <br>  "Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death." Proverbs 11:4<br>  <br>  "If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures." Job 36:11<br>  <br>  "For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?" Matthew 16:26<br>  <br>  "Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver." Proverbs 8:18, 19<br>  <br>  "The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth." Psalm 37:21<br>  <br>  "Then [Jesus] said to them, 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.'" Luke 12:15<br>  <br>  "I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything.

There are as many different living situations as there are people in this country. You can't assume that someone wanting a handout is lazy, won't work, relying on others, etc. You can't imagine what it would be like for a widowed mother raising children to find herself falling short every month despite working full time. Or a young person without health care to deal with a chronic disease out of their own pocket. These are people's realities and everyone in this country would rather be able to provide for themselves and their family if they could. <br>  <br>  Whether you think it's government's place to provide social programs or not, you have to admit that charitable organizations alone cannot provide what is needed in this country. We can't fund school programs like head start or the free lunches without government aid. <br>  <br>  Even John McCain said in 2000 that he thinks people who are able to be successful in this world and have a little more than others should feel privileged to help those who need it.|`|V72R8s93aa	Jesus was about helping ourselves and each other.

While the Conservatives who do watch Fox just accept that the media is overwhelmingly Liberal and defend their position because they know they can't change that... Yes they do bring up the Liberal media a lot, but that's because it's true, and even a Liberal will tell you that every news station other than Fox is slanted to the left, they just won't admit that they are at least as slanted, and that the media is so overwhelmingly Liberal, even though the ratio of Liberal stations to Conservative stations is evidence of that...|`|efdf492fe9cb67c309332e436d4aadc8aa	Why should it get taken off the air?

9rhmeb7raa	It was. But, it didn't have to be. I sat down for four hours, back in 1969, in a coffee shop in the Ropongi section of western Tokyo. A fellow member of the East-West Discussion Group was kind enough to have me speak to an elderly former Imperial Navy officer and also to act as interpreter. The third man was Minoru Genda, Yamamoto's Air Operations officer and the man who planned the attack. Genda told me the attack time was calculated on Japan delivering a declaration of war against the U.S. before Captain Fushida was to fly the lead plane through Kolekole Pass. That didn't happen and it remained a shameful episode in the Imperial Navy throughout the war. <br>  The other thing was more telling. He reminded me that every ship in the Imperial Navy had the clocks set to Tokyo time. Not GMT as we use. So, they attacked us on December 8th. The anniversary of the day when our first Ambassador to Japan (Townsend Harris) shamed the Shogun by practically throwing his credentials at the man. It was known in Japan as "Dai Banjin No Hi" (The Day of the Great Barbarian Shame). So, they expiated that shame by attacking us many years later. <br>  The other bases involved were Schofield Barracks, Kanehohe Air Station, Hickam Field, Bellows Field and Wheeler Field. |`|FTs2py0kaa	no one really knows............the Japanese Ambassador was waiting to see the pres before the attack and was kept waiting till after.......lots of<br>  roomers....... |`|N4u9DRvFaa	According to the 2nd link the attacks were simultaneous. Yes it was a big surprise.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	There has been conjecture for decades that FDR was forewarned and allowed the attack so the US would have a pretext to enter the war.  I consider that to be far-fetched.  Although FDR was cold-blooded in a lot of ways, and in my view did unspeakable harm to the country in some ways (keeping Americans in concentration camps, introducing Italian fascism to America via the New Deal, etc), I don' t see him as a person who would willingly and knowingly allow innocent Americans to be slaughtered by an enemy attack.  So I discount these rumors.  Besides, the US had been clandestinely attacking U-boats on a small scale for years without being formally in the war.   So if the US wanted into the war, there there was no need for a pretext.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	The Japanese didn't declare war prior to the attack.<br>  So technically it was a surprise attack. If it really was<br>  a surprise is probably impossible to say. There were more<br>  than enough hints to an attack in general and even the<br>  likely target as you don't have to be a genius to figure that<br>  out on your own. But that's much easier to say with hindsight.<br>  Sometimes you just miss the obvious or some moron forgets<br>  to report a little juicy detail.|`|DpzQ2Z1daa	Yes, it was, my Grandpa fought in Korea,  told me that it was, his father lost a good friend with the Pearl Harbour attack. His father fought in Pearl Harbour he said.|`|1b9fbd13ce796d4a53e1675c60b78414aa	The entire military complex of Pearl Harbor is inclusive of Kaneohe bay and all the other bases on Pearl, such as Schofield Barracks, etc.|`|1cUgE6sZaa	There is a conspiracy theory that says FDR instigated the Pearl Harbor attack as impetus for the U.S. to enter WW2|`|o04FhK6Yaa	yes that is why our ships were hit so bad and our air base killed so many *salutes those who died that day and Plays taps for the fallen that day.|`|nBzSzt9Naa	Actually, it wasnt. the funny thing is, is that the warning came an hour too late.|`|JDUWQRalaa	Pick your own view, but it was supposedly a sneak attack |`|DFix2lgbaa	They knew that an attack on Pearl Harbor was inament, and very possible.  <br>  There is controversy over the term, sneak attack, because technically pearl harbor was hit by surprised.  its like you know Santa Clause is coming in December... but oops he came on the 23rd and not the 24th, surprise.  They didn't know a date, They didn't know a time. But they did know that an attack to get the united states involved in WWII and actually participated as a whole country, was likely.  They pushed it out trying to make it not seem possible because of the distance the Japs would have to travel [and did obviously] to attack Pearl.<br>  So technically it was a sneak attack, but not really<br>  it depends on what you consider a sneak attack.<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|iDjRJpX0aa	From what i know, the Empire of Japan's attack on pearl harbor against the United states of America was intended to be a surprise attack to sink as much of the USA naval force as possible however by doing this they simply lost the war. Japan was fighting to many people at once now, China, Britain, Australia, Dutch east Indies. and now the USA-<br>  <br>  "We won a great tactical victory at Pearl harbor and thereby lost the war" -Hara Tadaichi - Japanese Admiral of WWII|`|JFWAHji3aa	it was sneak attack cause no1 expected them to attack pearl harbor they figured had there been an attack coming there would have been a foreshadow or atleast 1 warning|`|2NpQkxYOaa	Yeah, it was a sneak attack|`|QzqqME5paa	As far as the other bases, I do not know the names nor have I heard of them being attacked.  However, Pearl did have several warnings.  An AA gun emplacement saw the Zeros and could have done severe damage to the attacking force.  The men at that emplacement mistook the planes for some other kind of plane, whether civilian or military.  Because of this mistaken identity and a set of bureaucratic red tape that had to be cut before a second emplacement could relay the news to the people on the ground at Pearl, the Japanese with their 342 Zeros and several submarines were able to attack the harbor in 2 waves, temporarily hindering the navy, forcing the US to join WWII, and eventually causing the destruction of many Japanese ships, planes, military men, and civilians.  So, to answer your question, it was a sneak attack that could have been prevented with a little less assumption from the men at the first emplacement and a lot less bureaucracy.  Thanks to all those who fought and those who gave their lives during the horrific bloodbath that was WWII.  And God bless the troops currently serving in harm's way.|`|0szdPqI0aa	I do not know about the previous attack just before pearl harbor, but you must think about it logically. it is the 1940's. we do not have hi tech communications systems that get messages around instantly. And people are not always on guard. im sure if those attacks before pearl harbor happened, everyone was sleeping, and when the bombing started people were shocked, and maybe had a hard time getting a message out. and just before the pearl harbor attack, the us troops, were just waking up when it happened. and a little while after it started, people still did not know what happened. <br>  <br>  so it is not 2000, it is 1940's. If you do not think, waking up to hundreds of zeros bombing you early morning is not a sneak attack, then i do not know what is.|`|m6C3pgChaa	I don't like using wikipedia as a source but the break down there is pretty good:<br>  <br>  "First wave<br>   <br>  The Japanese attacked in two waves.

Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties.[23] It included:[40]<br>  <br>  1st Group (targets: battleships and aircraft carriers)[41] <br>  50 Nakajima B5N bombers armed with 800 kg (1760 lb) armor piercing bombs, organised in four sections <br>  40 B5N bombers armed with Type 91 torpedoes, also in four sections <br>  2nd Group — (targets: Ford Island and Wheeler Field) <br>  54 Aichi D3A dive bombers armed with 550 lb (249 kg) general purpose bombs <br>  3rd Group — (targets: aircraft at Ford Island, Hickam Field, Wheeler Field, Barber’s Point, Kaneohe) <br>  45 Mitsubishi A6M fighters for air control and strafing[40] <br>  <br>  <br>  The air portion of the attack on Pearl Harbor began at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time (3:18 a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time, as kept by ships of the Kido Butai), with the attack on Kaneohe.[44] A total of 353[7] Japanese planes in two waves reached O?ahu. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across O?ahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main U.S. Army Air Force fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Air Corps' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and Ford Island. <br>  <br>  Second wave composition<br>  The second wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki.[40] Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties.[23] This wave and its targets comprised:[40]<br>  <br>  1st Group — 54 B5Ns armed with 550 lb (249 kg) and 120 lb (54 kg) general purpose bombs[41] <br>  27 B5Ns — aircraft and hangars on Kaneohe, Ford Island, and Barbers Point <br>  27 B5N — hangars and aircraft on Hickam Field <br>  2nd Group (targets: aircraft carriers and cruisers) <br>  81 D3As armed with 550 lb (249 kg) general purpose bombs, in four sections <br>  3rd Group — (targets: aircraft at Ford Island, Hickham Field, Wheeler Field, Barber’s Point, Kaneohe) <br>  36 A6Ms for defense and strafing <br>  <br>  <br>  The second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kāne?ohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously, from several directions."<br>  <br>  From our vist to the Arizona memorial I remember reading several stories of how there were warnings of the attack and they were either delayed in getting to the proper people or dismissed as friendly aircraft that were scheduled to be coming in.<br>  <br>  "As the first wave approached O?ahu a U.S. Army SCR-270 radar at Opana Point near the island's northern tip (a post not yet operational, having been in training mode for months) detected them and called in a warning. Although the operators reported a target echo larger than anything they had ever seen, an untrained officer at the new and only partially activated Intercept Center, Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler, presumed the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers was the source. The direction from which the aircraft were coming was close (only a few degrees separated the two inbound courses),[42] while the operators had never seen a formation as large as the U.S. bombers on radar.[43] It is also possible the operators had only seen the lead element of the incoming attack.<br>  <br>  Several U.S. aircraft were shot down as the first wave approached land, and one at least radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing. Nevertheless it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly."
LsWdTDucaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  Get used to it.|`|tPjR0SQJaa	Unfortunately it is a double standard and it's very embarrassing to me as a black woman in America.<br>  <br>  It's very disturbing to me that you can display abuse of a white woman, display a white man being burned by flames but you dare not do the same display of a black man.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that the male couple who displayed the Gov and Sen effigy were being mean spirited because of Governor Palin's view of gay marriage.

It expressed displeasure with some public figure.<br>  >However, our culture assigns a diffeent meaning to hanging a black person in effigy.

Those who hung Obama in effigy were acting in a violently racist way.<br>  <br>  It's no good for such racists and their apologists to whine about a non-existent "double standard."

4iAMrHd1aa	I will give Obama the chance to prove he is a patriotic American by renouncing the obscene hate that is wealth redistribution.  I will give him a chance to show that he has courage by declaring war on Islamic radicals who live only to hate.  I will give him the chance to show tolerance by opposing the Fairness Doctrine and ceasing to intimidate media outlets that are unbiased instead of always favoring him unquestioningly.  <br>  <br>  I will even give him the chance to show that he loves America by not enslaving us with more regulation and bureaucracy.  Maybe he could even make us MORE FREE by deregulating more.  That would prove that he's not oppressive.<br>  <br>  But I won't hold my breath while I give him this chance.|`|ZDXQRspQaa	You do not own this country, and although your pride in it is great, you are not in the position of authority to direct anyone to leave.|`|bc76723f00c8fee2a7d80ca00dd367f9aa	                        very well said  |`|PtHThRoNaa	Where is your question?|`|8sd7qVeNaa	Thank you<br>  <br>  Please lets remember we are all in this together.

This is, to me, their worst mistake.  I can understand a desire to try different economic models, even when some clearly show they dont work...but when they try to use government to say what is good and bad for the people of America (What ever happened to the peoples right to persue life, liberty, and happiness whatever that may be for that person?)<br>  <br>  My contempt for republicans come from illogical arguments backed by rightous zeal of how their agenda is somehow from God.<br>  |`|R8GQZCInaa	Democrats have historically taken a beating from the Republicans verbally and frankly we are tired of it.

I even supported a socialist in one. I don't care about party affiliation in local politics, because local politicians and what they do are easier to hold accountable.<br>  <br>  But on the national level, the Republican Party has consistently used fear, lies, media manipulation, false flag terror alerts, open threats against factions they don't like, and have rallied to have a country in which only their party has any say.<br>  <br>  From Reagan, through Gingrich and the new Bush horror, the Republicans in Washington have proven themselves as repressive, dishonest, corrupt and dangerous to the well-being of our country.<br>  <br>  I want to vote them out of office, then get their leaders in front of tribunals. Dick Cheney behind bars in my lifetime! That's the fondest dream and the one I'll work hardest to achieve.<br>  <br>  If folks could only have a glimpse at the offshore bank accounts in the Caymans, a revolution would start and burn right up to the feet of Little King George himself.|`|7a29b3a79b6be9791212871768280c77aa	Out of time, out of touch, out of ideas, out of tolerance, out of patience, out of money, out of gas, and out of the race. <br>  <br>  DEWEY WINS!

It's because people are uneducated about the issues.  I disagree about Obama's plan though.  Please look at the facts before you vote.  Obama plans to cut taxes for 95% of Americans?  33% of Americans don't even PAY taxes.  He know these are bold faced lies, but keeps on saying them because his "followers" buy anything he says without researching it.  I agree that McCain isn't a great candidate either.  But I'm scared to think about Obama as president.  Think about it.  He only wants to raise taxes on businesses that make $250,000 a year or more?  The gas station where you fill your vehicle, the grocery store you shop at, clothing stores you shop at.  More than likely the business you work at.  We will see all those increased taxes trickle down our way.  Not to mention the associations obama has.  I doubt very much he is a terrorist, but he obviously has very poor judjudgment be keeping company with some of the people he does.  Oh, and the ACORN deal.  Read up on them before you vote.  They are trolling the streets in Ohio finding homeless, hookers and drug-addicts and taking them to register to vote and to vote.  And ACORN is obama's baby.  People have said, "These people shouldn't be allowed to vote?"  No, they shouldn't.  They pay no taxes, so this doesn't affect them.  They are completely uneducated about the policies of either candidate and therefore cannot make an informed decision when it comes to voting and they have no addresses.  How can they even prove who they are?  They can't.  I could go on and on and I have, sorry, but really look at these things before casting your vote on Nov 4th.

MaSS5Kd5aa	Australia has very strict gun control laws and hardly any gun related deaths whatsoever here. Seriously guns are made for one thing - killing people. People say they need a gun to protect themselves but many studies have shown that having a gun in the household actually increases the chances of death by shooting for those in the household (whether someone gets drunk and accidentally shoots someone, the ease it lets one commit suicide, or a thief taking your gun off you and shooting you with it, or shooting someone during a family domestic). No one needs guns, and if they were taken from everyone it wouldn't be a problem. <br>  Sure the army and police will still have guns, but at least the kid around the corner who's been up for three weeks straight on methamphetamine's and goes psychotic won't have one. Seriously it's common sense, you said it yourself, it's not the wild west anymore.<br>  We have a (relatively) very safe society here, and I think alot of that has to do with very strict gun control laws. The laws that you describe are common sense to me, guns shouldn't just be in the hands of anyone. I think the ease of gun availability is why your country has those tragic massacres -  which are very sad indeed. <br>  The logic people use for gun ownership is based on FEAR.|`|fBvhkalFaa	Because the NRA has pounded into their heads for years that any gun law, whether it is for safety or not is the first step to confiscation.

What business is it of yours or anyone elses what I have?|`|4iAMrHd1aa	The Founding Fathers felt it was essential  for ANY free country to have an armed population, for the purpose of killing politicians who become despots.  Plain and simple.  That was the reason the second amendment exists.<br>  <br>  For that reason, it's incredibly dangerous to democracy for the government to know who has weapons.  It eliminates the entire safeguard built into the constitution to end the life of a tyrant and endangers all our freedom.<br>  <br>  That's what Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin thought, anyway.|`|M3ZoYjkMaa	I am very liberal but I am also pro-gun.  The main reason being that when the law makes it illegal for law-abiding citizens to own a gun-the only people who will have guns are criminals.<br>  <br>  If we were an island nation that didn't already have tons of legal and illegal guns in the hands of the populace I would probably be in favor of much stricter gun control....but were not.<br>  <br>  Also, look at the failed experiments of just about all gun-control legislation in reducing crime or gun crime.  Chicago and DC have some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.....are they any safer?|`|P9zMowzTaa	What is wrong with a concealed weapon? If I am raped, I want to know that I will be able to defend myself against the attacker.<br>  <br>  In my state, you are required to take a gun handlers course in order to be qualified for a CWP. So it's not just dumb smucks who can't shoot who get those. <br>  <br>  Guns will fall into the hands of criminals anyways. No criminal is going to walk into a hunting store and walk out with an M-19 11. They are going to go to a guy name Tito who files off the serial numbers and sells them out of his basement.<br>  <br>  So gun control laws, no matter how carefully planned, will not hurt the criminal. Criminals will get guns anyways, and then when someone is attacked on the streets, they won't be able to reach into their backpack and protect themselves. <br>  <br>  Gun control to the degree of prohibitting CWP's, hurts law-abiding citizens.<br>  <br>  Jay M: That is not true. Not all people who own guns WANT to kill someone. I used to carry around a taser gun because it was non-lethal and I didn't want to hurt anyone. But a few months ago I traded it in for a CWP and a Smith and Wesson handgun. I decided that, if someone starts to attack me or my family, quite frankly I don't give a damn if I have to kill them to save my own life. In my weapons class, we were taught non-lethal defense moves, such as aiming for areas such as legs, or the shoulder blades where you can shoot someone and temporarily cripple them rather than kill them.<br>  But I take my life seriously. Usually, simply brandishing a handgun at a criminal is enough to make them run, so no shots are even required.|`|hZT7vM9Faa	The thing is not everyone in the U.S lives in the ghetto.  I live in a small rural setting. And for me guns are for protection, hunting, and sport.  No I dont need a AK-47 to hunt deer but it's fun to shred up a milk carton with one.<br>  <br>  But I also realize that the same AK-47 in say, Compton is used to kill innocent people. Not picking on Compton its just the most well known gangland to me.<br>  <br>  So for some gun control is just taking away our liberties, and to some they are to save lives.|`|yL3XFS7faa	I own guns, I hunt.  I believe people should be allowed to own guns as long as they are not felons, although I think restrictions should be made on how many guns a person can own.  I don't think it makes sense for a person who does not hunt or have any other FORMAL firearm safety/military/police training to be able to own stockpiles of guns. I don't believe people should be allowed to carry around pistols.  Just because you've passed a course doesn't mean your psychologically fit to carry a weapon as deadly as a handgun.  In my opinion, your not going to carry a gun unless somewhere in the back of your mind-you Want to kill someone.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The gun industry has managed to convince gun owners that if even the smallest gun control regulation is enacted, guns will inevitably be banned.  The gun lobbyists are unable to mentally distinguish between a criminal and a law-abiding citizen.  To them, gun control is bad, period.|`|FeivZKiaaa	Gun  Control laws only affect law abiding citizens. Why punish citizens with rules designed to interfere with their lives?

No one is taking any ones guns. They just want to know the people buying and using them are capable and safe to own them.|`|AA12290150	All civilised countries (except USA and Finland) have very stringent laws against gun ownership, especially hand guns. Why? Because there is a direct correlation between gun ownership and murder with guns. Most people killed with guns are killed by their family members. Very few use them to defend themselves from strangers. <br>  <br>  The countries with liberal gun laws, (USA and Finland) have many more massacres, nutters shooting up school yards etc. I have lost count of how many times it happened in USA and Finland. It seldom happens in countries where gun laws are hard. <br>  <br>  The inexplicable thing is that whenever there is a massacre in USA, rednecks want MORE guns!!!   Sheesh.<br>  <br>  Keep your 2nd amendment but toughen it so that everyone wanting a gun does a psych and crim assessment, has a good reason to own one, stores it at a police station. |`|CNroVD24aa	You really haven't investigated this issue much, have you? If you're really concerned about public safety, and forgive me if I sound racist, but why don't liberal cities send their police into the ghettos on raids? It's because liberals really don't care when there are gun fights in the streets unless it can advance their agenda to strike down the Second Amendment.<br>  <br>  And just so you know, our nation was founded on the idea that our rights come from our Creator, not government. Our Constitution outlines what the government CAN'T do, not what it can do. Our Founding Fathers were wise enough to be wary of big governments. It's too bad liberals don't agree.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Your last line is the whole story of the NRA's stand for decades.  Historically, those rights that are eliminated are first regulated a little,then a little more, then a lot more, then that right exists only as a ghost on paper.<br>  <br>  Think of how the First Amendment is fiercely protected, even in outrageous cases.  It is for that reason.  Very limited exceptions only are allowed.  A line has been drawn against a slippery slope.<br>  <br>  No such line has been drawn on the gun regulation issue.  On the contrary, it is all to clear what some see as the ultimate goal.  That almost no one will be allowed to own a gun privately, so that the chance of something unsafe happening is controlled.<br>  <br>  The Bill of Rights should be read as the Founding Fathers list of conditions necessary to be in place to rebel against established authority, to ultimately retain the right of self-determination.  They should know, they had just done it.  It is not by chance that it's the SECOND Amendment, right after freedom of speech.<br>  <br>  I didn't answer your question in detail, as I think this covers/supersedes them.  But;  "Just precautions that guns don't fall into the hands of criminals".  There is a quote from Ben Franklin (?), Tom Paine (?):  "Those who would trade freedom for security will end up with neither."<br>  <br>  Finally:  I live in NYC.  We have strict gun control laws.  Most citizens don't have guns.  The criminals still do.  No permits!  And if they don't get them from Virginia, etc, they'll get them from Columbia.  The kilos of drugs always get through, and so will the guns.  So strict gun control doesn't keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

No matter what you think we cannot just go around and killing people, it is not just the way things work.  How many times has Bush had the chance to kill Bin Laden in the past 8 years?|`|MEFqyg0Oaa	Please email me, rufio_bandit@yahoo.com, and show me first, how the Clinton Administration was responsible for the 9/11 attacks, even though they were the first administration to develop an anti-terrorism program, and even though it was through the Bush administration's inaction that the attacks happened.  <br>  Then explain how its Clinton's fault that our economy is in shambles, even though he balanced our budget while he was in office, and we experienced a government surplus, whereas today Bush has successfully put us in the largest government deficit. Ever. I know most conservatives and republicans fancy themselves as the fiscally responsible ones, so I would like an explanation for that one.  Bush took us from budget surplus to budget deficit, while making the situation for the vast majority of people who voted for him worse, by promising tax cuts that did not apply to the vast majority of our population.  <br>  And do not tell me that it's some policy about forcing the banks to give out loans to minorities that is the problem with our economy, because it's not.  The banking problems we are having are the result of irresponsible behavior by banks and consumers.  Banks were signing loans at teaser rates to bait ignorant consumers, allowed them to pay off the interest that they were going to make off the loan, and then sell it off to be securitized.  These loans then rose beyond their initial teaser rates to become unmanageable to these customers, and they defaulted.  The banks didn't care cause they made their interest, which is all the money they are gonna make, and the consumers were happy to get home loans with poor credit histories.  This is a major factor in our economic woes, and it's got nothing to do with Clinton.  If it did, what the hell have the fiscally responsible republicans been doing about it for the last 8 years?|`|tBSChaT9aa	Renee.... do not drink so much Kool-Aid your starting to sound like an Obamite....LOL.... but really as they (non Supporters of Obama0 say that he will screw up America.. and you say they are wrong then that can also go for the change babble have you seen any change yet...then shut up and don't preach the dogma if you cannot yourself support you own rhetoric|`|56c4b61aa3e2695f58adae3f19e00bbdaa	The change is coming.<br>  The next 4 to 8 years will be complete change.<br>  No more lying and deceiving and thumbing our nose at the constitution<br>  No more good ole boys network<br>  No more wars for profit.<br>  <br>  Obama never said he would not have experienced people on his staff.<br>  He said there will be CHANGE.<br>  And that change will come from a vast variety of people who will working side by side with him doing what is right for the country not what is right for the chosen few|`|AA11665632	"Clinton administration who are almost directly responsible for the 9-11 attacks and the current economic problems we face today, where is the change?<br>  <br>  "Almost directly responsible?!

Think about that really.  <br>  <br>  What most people don't realize is that small businesses fall within those lines.  More businesses then Obama will admit.  It's called sole proprietorship.  It's kinda like a catch 22.  You're thinking about John Doe, one person, making that amount of money of year.  Here's the catch.  John Doe who employs 5 people is included.  Even though John Doe himself actually takes home only $40,000.  So John Doe is actually going to have to pay more taxes even though he technically don't net $250,000 a year.  Mr. Doe is lucky enough to have a 5% profit from $250,000.  However, it's still his "duty" to pay higher taxes.  So what does John do in order to survive this tax hike?  Well he downsizes.  He lets go 2 of his employees.  He has to push the additional tax increase onto his customers to try to stay at a 5% profit.  So he raises his prices.  Therefore the company that buys his products/services has to either raise their prices or lay off.  It continues on down line until it affects you.  It will affect everything we buy because people will be passing the buck/increase down, literally.  <br>  <br>  So who fails and who thrives in this type of economy.  The rich will be paying higher taxes, yet charging more for their product/service.  They will survive.  They have enough money to cushion themselves for the next 4 years.  So it directly affects the middle class or average man.  Either way, we all will pay.|`|r2Bo3tkGaa	All of you jealous liberals - do some research before you spout off!  <br>  Historically, middle class citizens have done better under republican leadership than that of democratic leadership.  Under democrats you are taxed to death, and so are corporations that employ people, resulting in higher prices, slower economy, fewer jobs, higher interest rates.  <br>  <br>  IF Obama gets elected & IF he passes his tax plan, you will be taxed in new & creative ways - ulitmately paying more taxes.  Take a look at your utility bills someday & notice the fees (taxes) imposed on you.  Wake up folks!   |`|1FkYHLXDaa	Most people start out poor or middle class. Those who have a strong drive and the will to succeed make it "out" of the middle class. If you honestly believe that Obama is not going to raise your taxes after he gives you that promised tax cut for your vote you are sadly mistaken.<br>  <br>  If anything, the middle class hates themselves. I hope that the $1000.00 extra you receive from the tax cut will pay for the increases in consumer prices you will pay as a result of his tax increases on corporation. I also hope it will help you live more by your means. Doubtful it will actually help anyone.|`|sCAvtfpXaa	I believe it would be a proud statement in America's history to elect it's first African-American president.<br>  <br>  However, his tax cuts sound great to "middle class", are almost worthless.<br>  If you are married and have a household income of $40,000, you're should only be paying 7.6% in federal tax based on 2007 tax rates. If you are paying more, then you should take a look at your tax returns.<br>  Why?<br>   $40,000<br>  -$17,100 (for standard deduction and personal exemptions)<br>  ------------<br>   $22,900 is what you are taxed on.<br>  <br>  According to this tax rate schedule (<a href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=164272,00.html)," rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,...</a> you would pay:<br>  $782.50 + (15,075 * .15) = $3,043.75<br>  <br>  To get your effective tax rate, which is the amount of money you pay in federal tax for every $1,000 earned. You take tax you paid divided by your gross income.<br>  $3,043.75 / $40,000 = .07609375 or 7.61%<br>  <br>  So, you're paying LESS than the lowest tax bracket under the current presidency.<br>  That can be lowered even more if you have a qualifying mortgage which you can deduction the interest that you pay, however I wouldn't suggest that too many people try to do that, since it would only benefit you if you pay more than $10,700/yr in interest on a mortgage and property taxes, since that is the standard deduction.<br>  <br>  Now, if you use the same scenario as introduced above and have 2 kids, you get the child tax credit. So, your taxes fall to $1,043.75, which is 2.6% effective tax!<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Now of course every person who receives income will also have to pay Social Security and Medicare tax on their incomes as well, which is current 7.65%. But NEITHER candidate is talking about lowering either one of these 2 rates, so EVERYONE is stuck paying the same rate, except those that exceed the $102,000/yr income, which is the current upper limit for being taxed on Social Security.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  Why is it that we need MORE legislation, aside of the type of legislation to undo previous legislation?<br>  Instead of the government deciding how to redistribute wealth, the middle-class have their own means to do it.<br>  <br>  It is simply their choice to purchase goods, or not too!<br>  Do I really need that big flat screen TV? Or will this digital ready TV do the trick? Or heck what about keeping the existing TV and purchase the converter that costs about $30 at the local Walmart so they don't have to spend $500 or more.<br>  Heck, you even have one more choice and instead of purchasing a TV altogether, just get rid of it and replace it with books instead!<br>  You see, if they choose not to purchase goods until they can afford to pay in cash, they have just caused a temporary correction in the economy.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  And this final thought, which is a quote from one of our great presidents.<br>  To be fully honest, I used to really dislike the man because due to legislation that happened during his term, I was left jobless. However, a decade or so down the road I realized I was wrong!<br>  "The most dangerous myth is the demagoguery that business can be made to pay a larger share, thus relieving the individual. Politicians preaching this are either deliberately dishonest, or economically illiterate, and<br>  either one should scare us.<br>  Business doesn't pay taxes, and who better than business to make this message known? Only people pay taxes, and people pay as consumers every tax that is assessed against a business. Begin with the food and fiber raised in the farm, to the ore drilled in a mine, to the oil and gas from out of the ground, whatever it may be---through the processing, through the manufacturing, on out to the retailer's license. If the tax cannot be included in the price of the product, no one along that line can stay in business." ---Ronald Reagan|`|jUWwcknJaa	What you are missing is that giving cuts to poor people does not work because poor people do not provide jobs to other people.

Al Quaida is desperately in need of new recruits due to their utter failure in Iraq, which they had devoted a huge portion of their resources and manpower to.  They think they can build McCain up as "anti-muslim" and get kids to join them, basically.  By comparison, most muslims sort of consider Obama "one of them", so he would be hard to recruit against.

Foreign Powers that don't like America, don't like what America stands for.  The image of America (sad to say) is an older white man in a suit and a soldier helmet, that embodies everything these hostile nations dispise.  McCain completely fits that bill.  <br>  <br>  Ironically, he's a soldier, so he thinks militarily first, and diplomatically second.  He's always 'fight fight fight', and never 'talk discuss listen'.  When under Military presidency, we bully other countries into falling in line with what our demands are before we "allow" them to talk to us; but government calls it "preconditions."  I don't believe in just flying over to Iran in an Ospry, wearing a bulletproof vest with a camera crew and talking to hostile leaders, no; what I do believe is that we can sit and talk with foreign leaders in a suitable, controlled, safe setting, and discuss the issues at hand without making people feel like they are small and feeble to us.  I just can't see how McCain would do anything different than what Bush did.  <br>  <br>  McCain hasn't shown the kind of patience it takes to deal with people who have different views than his own during this election; what makes anyone think that it's going to be different when he's talking to foreign leaders who genuinely don't like America and don't respect who we believe ourselves to be (the rulers of the free world)?  Seems to me that the only thing McCain has shown me during this election is that he'll get easily frustrated, visably flustered and angry, and make eratic decisions without properly thinking them through.<br>  <br>  So, hypothetically speaking, McCain would get us 'nuked'.  |`|HisTVeOXaa	First of all: Hussein is a very common name.

Way to go McCain.<br>  <br>  Obama/Biden '08|`|joh3VNcZaa	To a previous respondent:<br>  <br>  1) He doesn't need a plumbing license to do residential stuff in Ohio if he works under his company's license.  Non-issue<br>  <br>  2) His real name is Samuel Joseph.  So unlike certain presidential candidates he is not ashamed of his middle name and uses it.  Non-issue.<br>  <br>  I think it is more Joe the Plumber put a target on Obama's back by asking a question that reveals Obama the Merciful's true socialist nature.<br>  <br>  I wish the media gave Obama half the scrutiny they gave a non-candidate such as Joe the Plumber.  Why can't they do their job?  Joe and most Amercians have to do it for them.<br>  <br>  It is shameful the way the Democrats have treated Joe the Plumber.  It should scare voters to see that this is how Democrats feel about average America.|`|V2J3wOHGaa	No, Obama and his group has done that. They are digging into his past just like they did Sarah Palin.  That poor Fl reporter is probably being investigated right now back to the day of her birth.  <br>  <br>  Three newpapers have been dropped by Obama's campaign for daring to state that they support McCain.<br>  <br>  Who really cares whether Joe, Sam or whatever his name is has a plumbers license.  Most of the the licenses are earned by serving as an apprentice to a licensed plumber.  At least he is working and his only crime is that he had the audacity to ask a legitimate question|`|HJGgVvkvaa	Yeah your right! <br>  <br>  Obama supporters may out of a fit of anger (when Obama looses the election)  take it out on Joe the plumber! <br>  <br>  Some may say that Obama will not loose.

He was against Amensty and the Guest Worker programs.

So of course to get the fathers vote, they will both say they're against illegal immigration.|`|MRDumTBiaa	Both of them have similar immigration policies.|`|kn0peJ2Xaa	mc cain,he actually sign yes for amnesty!obama was against it!|`|AA10045620	Probably McCain.|`|yynC47EMaa	Both candidates are basically for illegal immigration. John McCain being the Senator of Arizona actually put his words into action and did very little to stop illegal immigration into Arizona. He was actually very passionate about having it and took a lot of heat on the issue from republicans, what a Maverick!<br>  This is why Illega immigration was not a debate issue, because both of them agree with it. Looks like you better start learning to habla.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	In the past, both have been very lenient on immigration.  McCain's campaign nearly ended last fall because of his support for the Immigration reform that Bush and the Democrats favored.  He has since moved to a tougher stance, but that is probably just eleciton positioning.  I expect he would govern as very liberal on immigration, as would Obama.<br>  <br>  |`|1RTwcBXraa	Unfortunately, they both are very weak on their stances.

He's a lot like Harry Truman in that he isn't appreciated in his own time.  He's something of a victim of his own success.  If the US had done a worse job of national security under Bush and we had terror attacks here monthly, his critics would never have felt safe enough to politicize the war on terror the way they have.  Open debate is a good and essential thing, but when you have US senators directly borrowing whole phrases from the speeches of Osama bin Laden, criticizing Bush in exactly the same language, that's too far (Harry Reid and Ted Kennedy both did this).  <br>  <br>  Just preventing another 9/11 is an amazing accomplishment.  It's something nobody thought could be prevented.  That's a feather in Bush's cap, and it stands as one of the most amazing things any President has ever accomplished, frankly. <br>  <br>  The rest of Bush's legacy will be tied to the middle east.  If the seed democracies he sowed dry up and die, he'll be remembered as a foolish dreamer with unrealistic expectations (another Woodrow Wilson).  But if they continue to grow as they have the last few years, then the effect will last for years.  Over the next few generations, that democracy will spread to other countries and soon the entire middle east will be democratic, in maybe a hundred years.  If that happens, Bush will be remembered as the "father" of Arab democracy.<br>  <br>  Either way, history will be far kinder to him than the silly venom you hear now.  That's just nonsense from people whose idea of politics is to try and shout down anyone you disagree with, and those idiots will soon either learn better or die out (I'm looking at you, college campuses).

deJ9df1iaa	I notice no rational reasons for keeping the electoral college.  Gerrymandered congressional districts only serve partisan agendas and NOT the true will of any state,  which is represented by the popular vote.|`|7708f35ffa2cf7f984891812e17158beaa	I'm a lefty, but I wholly support the Electoral College system.  It goes back to the notion of the framers and our concept of federalism, and that each state is actually a sovereign and not merely a region.  It requires candidates and parties to pay some attention to the individual smaller population states and not just New York and California.  At the time of the framers, they worried about the disproportionate influence of Virginia.<br>  <br>  The logical extension of your argument would be to disband the senate. I think things have worked for the most part pretty nicely over the last 220 years or so.|`|WQgep8Adaa	Yes, its long been time for that to happen.<br>  <br>  For everyone who says "they'll stop campaigning in small states" well they don't campaign in Texas or California for the most part because of the EC...you don't see to care about that.<br>  <br>  double, we saw what Nixon did with his Presidency, not a good comparison.  he "opened China" great, now thats a manufacturing base for our nation.

None of them have gone anywhere.  The problem is that it would take a constitutional amendment, which would require some of those small states to vote to give up some of their power.  And why would they do that?  I mean, just for the good of the country, not their own state?|`|4Aauh87yaa	No. The Electoral College is the only fair way to do things. Most of our population is on both coasts in very liberal states, which means they would dominate presidential elections. That's not fair to the rest of the country's population at all. Exactly why the idea of the Electoral College was created in the first place.|`|AA11934014	The college vote system was designed to ensure that the smaller states did not get ignored in favour of the larger States.  <br>  It can, and has, caused massive problems, but many systems do.<br>  <br>  The principal problem as I see it is leaving voter registration to the political parties and associated groups and not having compulsory annual electoral rolls as in the UK. <br>  <br>  |`|t27SvIPbaa	Don't be conned by politicians.

Honestly, there are tons of people like Bin Laden out there, he's just become the name that everyone knows.  He's not some brilliantly evil genius, he's a generic crafty terrorist, there's a ton out there now.  Terrorism has become run of the mill in the middle east, and sure, Al Qaeda is one of the most powerful, but if Bin Laden dies or is dead there's someone ready to move on in and they're just as sick or sicker.  The problem is that everyone was focusing on kicking Bin Laden's *** instead of worrying about the extreme conditions in the countries these people are from that drive them to these terrible actions.  How about instead of going on a world wide manhunt for one guy, we make an effort to take down the whole organization, and better the conditions of the people living in these horrible countries so that they aren't so full of despair that they go off and suicide bomb people.  Terrorism is very appealing to people who have nothing and are promised everything by someone in their religion.|`|9XEEmqDCaa	That's a good question.  I think he may be dead.

This was possible in large part because of their unions, strikes, threats of strikes and the negotiating power that came with unions.<br>  <br>  Now the ordinary working American can get a job at Wal-mart at a wage they can't live on even if their spouse is working at Wal-mart with them.  I think they'd be grateful for Vinnie "The Chin" to help them get a living wage.  Historically, employers have opposed unions, not workers.

At least having even more corrupt and incompetent people than himself in the line of succession offers Obama some protection against the most extreme forces that might oppose him.

The worst is yet to come.  Please read:<br>  <br>  Henry Lamb:<br>  <br>  "Like Obama, some people really believe that when government redistributes wealth, "it's good for everybody." They do not realize that wealth redistribution is no substitute for wealth creation. They are never taught that the only way to create wealth is for an individual to combine his energy and intellect with resources to produce a product that improves his life, or for which someone else is willing to pay. Private property, the accumulation of personal prosperity and individual achievement are anathema to socialism. Socialism sees the individual as nothing more than a cog in a government-run machine designed to ensure equity for all. Capitalism seeks prosperity; socialism seeks equity. Freedom increases as prosperity increases. In a socialist system, there can be neither."<br>  |`|415fc4b59e89a95acf4cac97823d4179aa	WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!?!?!<br>  <br>  Reagan passed away many years ago.

Remember that Iran and Iraq were engaged in a bloody war at the time and that we more or less sided with Iraq.<br>  <br>  It's also worth noting that the concept of "terrorist" state meant something a little different in the 1980's versus today.

I'll take him at his word. I also believe that Reagan - though involved in some aspects of Iran/Contra - probably had very limited involvement.<br>  <br>  Is President Reagan giving missiles to a terrorist state illegal?<br>  You have to first define "terrorist state" - since Reagan did not give the missiles to a terrorist state, your argument has no grounding in reality.<br>  <br>  Is President Reagan giving missiles to a terrorist state immoral?<br>  See previous.<br>  <br>  Could President Reagan still be brought to trial for Treason in Abstinentia?<br>  There can always be a trial - but there's even less evidence today than there was in the 1980's and early 90's. <br>  <br>  Treason: The violation of allegiance toward one's Country or Sovereign, esp. the betrayal of one's Country by waging war against it or by purposely aiding its enemies.<br>  If anything, Reagan can be credited by given aid to those fighting against our enemies (i.e. Iranian insurgents and Rebels in Communist Nicargua.) Hardly treasonous - only the most zealous leftists would claim so. <br>  <br>  Or does President Reagan giving missiles to the terrorist state Iran make him one of the greatest Presidents in history?<br>  You make so many assumptions and have such an elementary view of the world in the mid 1980's - I half wonder if you even lived in that time period.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Reagan sold obsolete junk to Iran expressly for the purpose to save the lives two hostages (who are alive today for this reason alone), and then used the profit to help the Nicaraguan people overcome the bloodthirsty oppression of Daniel Ortega (which even HE now has repented for).  <br>  <br>  You can legitimately accuse Reagan of being inconsistent with his stated policy of not dealing with hostage takers, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  |`|024Pu2XRaa	I don't know who's lies you are repeating, but it's pretty sick and ignorant.<br>  Bill Ayers wanted to kill thousands of innocent Americans.

n3LLORmWaa	As some of other contributors have mentioned, a day off would not get more Americans to vote.  Most government employees and members of labor unions get off for a Presidential election.  Many other employers will allow 1-2 hours off on Election Day for a person to go vote.  Most states allow early voting (see first link) by going to polls or voting by mail in the weeks preceding the election.  Americans have the time to vote.<br>  <br>  The bigger problem is a poorly-designed electoral system, which causes apathy. Unlike most other first world nations which have 3-4 major political parties, and many viable smaller ones, in the US almost all elections are won by Democrats or Republicans.  There is no proportional representation, so party which receives 10% of all votes may elect no Congressmen.  <br>  <br>  For the Presidential race, most states grant all their Electoral College votes to the candidate with the majority of votes in that state (see second link).  So if you live in a state that is strongly Republican or strongly Democratic, your vote is somewhat meaningless.|`|DpFHJiw3aa	poor voter turnout is the result of apathy.<br>  ask those who gripe and complain whether or not they ever even vote.<br>  most often they will tell you they don't even vote.<br>  go figure.<br>  <br>  nothing ever changes, so a lot of people don't see the point in voting.<br>  if you're voting for the lesser of two evils, there really isn't any point to it, is there?<br>  <br>  and with candidates like mcCain and obama, it's like choosing between cancer and polio.<br>  |`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	No however if one were to inform their boss that they would be a bit late becuase they are going to polls, ask for a longer lunch hour or asked to leave work a bit early.

I dont really care for McCain or Obama but there are to many people who hate Obama and that are talking about what they will do if he gets in the white house.<br>  <br>  This statement does not reflect my views. It is just things i hear.|`|dBtFTxjRaa	There shouldn't be any resentments.  Anyone have the opportunity to run for President at any time.  Sen O'Bama happened to take a shot at it first.  Win or lose, everyone else can do the same thing.  Only ignorant people make a big issue out of it.  Either you vote or don't vote the candidate, and hope for the best.  Simple as that.|`|gwjU4GKyaa	I can't speak for all jews, but this Jew is voting for Obama and will be thrilled when he wins. My entire family (who happen to be Jews also) are too voting for Obama, as are their Jewish friends and acquaintances. So, I don't think Jews will be resentful. |`|DJZ5qKyVaa	One of my best friends is Jewish and he really really wants Obama to win. Religion has nothing to do with the being president. |`|8zi54M2Laa	Ha.  Jews own the media(1) and look who the media endorses.|`|BE2vknbHaa	I'm Jewish and i have  no problem with a black president. In case you didn't know Judaism  isn't a race its a religion.|`|AA12377597	I am a Jew, I would be resentful, but not because of that reason.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with any of Obama's policies.|`|Sgowm3G7aa	yeah,  they should be pretty resentful when Barack helps muslim nations to eradicate jews and the state of Israel|`|uRulL6xyaa	Jewish will  circumcised him. lol|`|PyUr3l8caa	NO!!! The Jews do not want a Jewish president.|`|lotCAT8Waa	lol.. no not all|`|zTWmbN4Waa	yes, i'll be soooooo pissed.|`|meisgiZBaa	i ... don't think they would be?
OLpWRv2uaa	They should turn it into a rescue mission. |`|EhoJ9mgsaa	There are only 131 rooms.........lol<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd say she'll get tired of that after appx. 6 months.<br>  <br>  Obama's wife will too.|`|KjY2pANcaa	She can if she wants to <br>  Its going to be Obama,s home so why not|`|zEVpA4WCaa	 It's called free housing.|`|2Hlctljgaa	I don't care.  |`|ZzHE0lvtaa	Won't be the first time, probably won't be the last.  I am more disturbed about Obama moving into the Whitehouse.  America will never recover.|`|04e064b1e27b063681444d2c731a008daa	We're moving on up to the east side, to a deluxe apartment in the sky...|`|LROaxvV8aa	Why not?It's a semi-free country.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	I have no problem with it.  The family must pay their own way for food, laundry and any number of other services.  Its not like there's some significant cost to tax payers.  I think it sets a great model for American families.  This used to be a very common family arrangement.|`|AfaFCiKxaa	Very good move.  Saves them the cost of a nanny (yes, the president has to pay family expenses) and the residence is plenty big enough.  Best part is the kids get the continuity of having their grandma as their support when mom's away.|`|H1NjIT10aa	Why not a beloved family member instead of Nanny?  This will be good for the girls and allow the Obama's to have peace of mind when ever they have to leave the girls over night.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Yeah.. they have those andrae.. It doesn't matter if she moves in.. It won't effect obama politically.|`|5fFgrET8aa	He can practice a heimlich maneuver on her.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	How very fitting|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	I don't care because the issue is irrelevant.|`|AA10106538	none of my business.<br>  but no dog in my house. gross|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	good for her!!! we all need grandmothers & daughter-laws like that  more love for the kids the better.|`|WtGo7w18aa	It really doesn't matter.  It's not my house, it's theirs...for now.|`|BUS5PJEmaa	Neutral....no feelings good or bad. |`|4FyJM8hhaa	It's not our business!|`|X0wJpJ9aaa	No way it would be good for our country!|`|AA10468622	It's just fine with me. I would do the same thing if I were in their shoes--they'll both be so busy; it's great that the kids will have their grandmother to spend time with them.<br>  <br>  I suspect those that have a problem with it don't understand that the White House already employs several hundred servants whose sole job is to cater to the whims of the First Family. Complaining about a grandmother moving in is downright stupid, in the grand scheme of things.|`|7abd5c52aa4d20e1e7307fe4a8860758aa	I think it will be a big change for the girls and having grandma there will help their transition.  Also, their mom will be a bit busier now and it will be good for them to be with a family member than just white house nannies.  I'm not an Obama fan, but I think family relationships are important for anyone, anywhere.|`|45UDf3mxaa	I guess it doesn't really matter but she doesn't live with the family so why is she moving in. It's not like it's his mother. Michelle isn't the president. It bothers me though that we are wasting our money so that the secret service has to provide protection to her because she is living there. |`|z8nNysRFaa	I'm just curious as to why?  I knew they ripped Palin about having so many kids and traveling, and she wouldn't even be in the white house.  I heard the obama's needed the grandma to help take care of the kids, was that why?|`|GMA9erCDaa	I have my mother-in-law living in my house.  My opinion is that with the economy crashing, terrorism, and war, doesn't the guy have enough to worry about without having to deal with his mother-in-law?|`|l4EJtGPpaa	everyone is moving in there,<br>  <br>  but where is obamas mothers side of the family in all this? i still haven't seen a single one of them anywhere in sight all threw the elections and after.<br>  <br>  somethings not kosher with that|`|AA10478980	Extended families have lived together for generations.  It is a good thing for all concerned.|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	Ask this question from homeless people.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Can't they just get her a trailer in the back yard?  That way she has her privacy still.|`|tVA664IPaa	It's a really big house.|`|ce0f2ff39aa5b5639eaea70b54b42eddaa	>None of my business.<|`|6TAp4PB5aa	i think the white house is a nice crib...|`|TGZg9WSCaa	Fantastic. She can walk the dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ueKeUZ6oaa	Why do you care so much?  You must have no life.|`|urFA9WAGaa	Sounds good.|`|3zyJV51Uaa	I think it's ok|`|Pdu131uKaa	I feel like a bowl of ice cream.  Anybody else want one?|`|AP1TzOnVaa	I don't see why it matters.|`|pDU0F2QDaa	I don't think it's any of our business, nor does it matter.|`|HcFc1gmraa	obamas mother in law moving in will be great because his kids are very young and he and his wife may need help raising the kids while in the white house. he will be super busy. it is always better to have a caregiver for the kids who is related. having the grandmother there is a good choice. it wont effect our country because his mother in law wont have any say in government decisions. she is only there to help the family and the young girls.|`|rf41irbraa	It's Obama's home for the next 4 years, once he and his family moves in. Why would his choice of who lives with him affect the country if it is not a big deal. It shows that he is close with family and sort of a role model, allowing others into his home.|`|DDCUbMG6aa	you mean the dog house, for his mother-in-law. The monkey bars on the front lawn for his kids.The out house for his wife.The oval office for him, and Condoms leave it Rice no who the sexatary of state, the one with the big lips. You ask for it.|`|G1nQYdHHaa	It's frickin awesome! You know why? Because it is the start of socialism! He is spreading the wealth from the git-go! Crud... I hope he gets his cousins, aunts, uncles, relatives that are coming out of the wood work, and through DNA testing perhaps I too am linked way, way, way, way, down the road!  "Yeah, get me a cup of tea. I will see you in the bowling alley... I mean basketball court!" |`|MxFyRrbzaa	I think it's a woman moving into her son-in-law's house. Nothing more. If it improves the lives of the Obama's, great for them. I'm happy that they're happy. But I really doubt it'll have any effect on the country.|`|qgmNKDaoaa	If nothing it will be a good example for the rest of the country as to not dump elderly family members to be forgotten in old folk holmes.|`|7AnY9IePaa	For the  family yes<br>  the country who the hell knows.<br>  The white house is turning into a mom and daught place.<br>  Maybe people will be more respectful of their parents.|`|uraqDegqaa	It doesn't really matter because she's part of his family.  I don't really think that has anything to do with the country though.|`|7126c39ad92386cc2426ac9f2d9f35e8aa	A better question would be how does Obama feel about his mother-in-law moving into the White House!?
grBxTsK6aa	We are a combination of the  two, if we have a healthy mindset.  Leaning one way too far would make you a radical....or....a MAVERICK. lol.|`|0a78e11c60dc1aa5ae0fc490736a46a9aa	obviously, there is a bipolar nature to humankind.  Clearly, the Right and Left have differing views of what makes a good society.  I wonder though, how, when most every nation is more Left than America, and we kick their butts economically, one could argue with the Right viewpoint.<br>  <br>  Competition brings out the best.|`|yGoHxJCcaa	Is Capitalism the best system out there? Perhaps, perhaps not. When looking at the distinctions the best you can really do is compare it to other forms. I'd certainly take Capitalism over say... Nazism. Or a Dictatorship. Or, in the case of Obama, Socialism.<br>  While I can respect your viewpoint that you don't feel he's a Socialist but something more middle-ranged, I and most Republicans do believe he is.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Obama believes in crushing alll dissent.  Nobody who disagrees wtih him will be allowed to speak.  He's a dictator wannabe.  He's already trying to intimidate TV stations from airing McCain ads by threatening to pull their licenses when elected.<br>  <br>  The LAST person as liberal as Obama to serve as President kept Americans in internment camps for the crime of being Japanese.  That's the kind of abuse that Socialism causes (and yes, FDR was very much a Socialist, specificallly of the Italian fascist tradition popularized by Mussolini).  <br>  <br>  
AMTYPir7aa	his mother is 96 years old and recently drove across europe. |`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	No.  john is filled with anger and hate and will most likely pop a head gasket way before that.|`|6c738af4ac776343f2bc535bba7907ceaa	YES|`|i5F2jwvhaa	I hope so<br>  <br>  I do not wish death on any American<br>  |`|71d27503429ff4cd41803c4f558d7a37aa	I believe he will be alive, though we need to remember that his Mom never suffered in a North Vietnamese prison camp.  I don't think he will run again.  Generally, once a nominee loses the presidential election you don't see them on the ticket again.  An exception to this was Richard Nixon, another Teddy Roosevelt.|`|R8GQZCInaa	Why wouldn't he be alive? But then, a 20 year old can step in front of a truck and not be here tomorrow. So, that being said, I don't know if he will be or not. Only God knows.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Honestly, it's 50/50 who will live the longest between him and Obama.<br>  <br>  |`|HjG0ShZ3aa	Who knows he could die tomorrow.|`|AA10576174	There is not one of us guaranteed tomorrow. It is not up to us.|`|MUlrc3XIaa	he has a young wife she will do her part  to keep him around for a while till he runs out of cialis|`|8f4505dbf3fb5cdeab8483ad9be73881aa	He is probably going to cry himself to death. LOL|`|HmNqCDsQaa	No|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	As long as he takes care of himself and has a little luck on his side, I don't see why not.<br>  <br>  This is a very morbid question.|`|724634aa550e4f2aa216e83840f9e8a4aa	Biden suffers from aneurysms, he has a better chance of passing then McCain.....
UOqi5ZkRaa	They have their mouth open - old joke|`|ZjSgawcpaa	Right from the moment they open their mouth.|`|AA11008868	When you get the bill.  |`|3NKOVaNhaa	When they ise slang like "Joe the Plumber" and "Maverick" and "Tito the builder"|`|4GQrTt2Naa	You really don't need to listen to them talking. Whatever comes out of their mouth about themselves is a lie and also about their opponents.|`|uzTx5SSRaa	When they're talking ...|`|AA10464052	Lol|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	You could tell, when they registered republican, that they were planning on either swallowing or spewing out lies.<br>  <br>  .|`|ndV4Jry5aa	Their lips are moving.

It's just Nice to have money to, you know, EAT and you know, WEAR CLOTHES, and you know maybe HAVE A HOUSE FOR WHICH TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY, ya know? Ya know? Just sayin' that'd be nice, wouldn't it?|`|hexzaIGgaa	Are YOU a hero? Doubtful. Put your A-S-S in the grass for a bit, then get back with me.<br>  <br>  - Captain Yggdrasil (USAF retired) is not amused.<br>  VietNam Veteran 1971-1972<br>  100% Disabled Veteran|`|qibtUmiLaa	Yes they are, they volunteered to go into the danger zone, to fight for rights and freedoms that you take for granted.  You should be thanking them, |`|ohwzWPsqaa	do you think superman got paid?...... of course he did.|`|DxIxYY3Iaa	I was a soldier in Viet Nam 1966-7. I was paid $273 a month to be shot at. Were low pay the measure of being a hero, I would have qualified. I was no hero. I killed plenty in Nam, but still no hero. Course all that was 42 years ago. Looks like the victors write the history. North Viet Nam ended up winning their independence from foreign domination. But while there every soldier  is defending the Constitution and all it stands for. They fight and risk their lives in your place. And for that they are heroes. Whether or not a war is right, soldiers do as directed and again, they are heroes for that. And the ones currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan stand as the greatest of heroes. May they all be coming home soon, safely and as victorious marching units.|`|22abd7968457d2986608219f92d70b85aa	Not all soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marine are heros.  Only the ones that do heroic deeds like jump on a grenade to save others without thinking of themselves first, or something equivilant to that. <br>  <br>  A hero to you may not be a hero to me.  It's all in what their actions mean to other people, but paid or not paid, they're more heoric than you, you little twirp because they voulnteered to put their life on the line for your sorry a$$$ because you don't have the balls to do it yourself.  That's MY definition of a hero.<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	Heck yes they are heros!  Anyone who does a job that puts their life in danger for the sake of saving other's is a hero in my book.  Not only do they put themselves in danger but they are away from their families for years at a time.  That's not something the average joe can do.|`|nKMJ9U3Paa	They might get paid. But I dout they do it for the money. They do it to protect our country, They risk their lives for our country not for the pay(that isn't very much anyway). Soldiers are heroes plain and simple!! |`|V6slDthdaa	I think they are. Soldiers, especially enlisted, don't make a lot of money at all. My Dad/husband/brother etc. all served, and they didn't do it for the money.|`|e3av6sY0aa	It depends on the soldier.<br>  <br>  There are "heroes" in every profession, even yours.|`|AA12165299	yes they are...are you out there risking your life for peanuts...|`|gLMhG9fVaa	As a U.S Army Soldier<br>  <br>  I can say that we are not paid very much at all..<br>  but we dont do it for the money.|`|iPQbeVTZaa	It is true that soldiers are heroes. They fight for a cause that they may or may not believe in and it is glorified slaughter. They are the bitches of their country and they are screwed over in ever situation. They really take bullets for a country that is less grateful for their contributions. The people on the front lines make things happen. The world leaders are just a face for the greater organizations. Now tell me is minimum wage enough?|`|o04FhK6Yaa	many rise above and beyond. it's not the pay that makes someone a hero, it's the integrity, honor and self sacrifice. fire men get paid and they are considered heros as well. pay attention to detail. The airline pilots that crashed the flight in PA  killing everyone on board to save more lives were heros, as were all of the members of the flight, they almost unanimously agreed to take the flight down than to let it hit something huge killing mass ppl,. I will assume u don't have the qualities of a hero, so you will never be one.|`|OQ12LRvuaa	Yes if soldiers didn't fight WW2 would of been a lot different. I would say the soldiers fighting in the war on terror are also. Regardless of what you believe about the wars we are in now they are still fighting for you. Anyone that is willing to put there life at risk for there country is a patriot and a hero, as long as they do it right (not torture people etc). Its odd only a radical left wing liberal (not you moderates) would call them murders etc.|`|5NWRtFWZaa	yes and no. it depends on how you wanna look at it. as u said they are getting paid and that does kinda void it out. but if you look at it this way those people are going out on the battlefield risking their lives. its not like they were forced to be soldiers they are doing it because they love their country. is that not what a hero is someone who selflessly goes out and risks something great without being forced to do it. getting paid is just a sort of thank you if you wanna think of it that way.<br>  <br>  im not patriotic or anything but that's just my opinion. |`|cr7SNhIKaa	I believe that soldiers are heroes. The only reason they get paid is to support their families. And besides, the don't get paid THAT much anyways, so it's wonderful of them to serve our country in a way that keeps us free. They could have a much easier job that has much less of a risk and pays a lot more, but no; they choose to support and serve our country as the heroes they truly are.|`|yp8Aeu7zaa	yes i think so because they are there to serve and protect our country. if they werent out there fighting for us and trying to keep us safe, who would? nobody?...our country would be in much more danger without them. i think its right that they get paid because a lot of them are over there getting hurt. i mean, look at all the ones that have even died. there are men and women over there that are getting hurt and arent able to get a job back over here because of that. many of them are put out of work after coming back from serving our country.|`|lizxjPKFaa	I am a Soldier. <br>  <br>  Am I a hero? <br>  <br>  I doubt it. Google PFC Ross McGinnis -- he was a hero. <br>  <br>  I'd like to think that I would have the courage to act as he did, but I cannot say that I would without being there and doing that. No one can.<br>  <br>  Let me explain something to you: I make 1949$ base pay, as a SPC with three years at my job, per month. I make an additional 800$ a month for housing, 279$ for food, and 600$ to offset the cost of the euro rate (I am stationed in Europe) = 3628$. <br>  <br>  I support two children, and because I had no choice but to move off-post, I paid over 1200$ in rent last month --- and it will probably be more next month. Over 100$ a month for electric, and about 70$ just for house phone and internet. 650$ a month in childcare, and about 400$ a month in groceries. About 250$ in gas, because I live 30 minutes away, and then of course, my children need to be clothed, as do I, and trust me, the ACU DOES NOT last six months (though my old BDU's are still holding up), and the boots are for crap. What are expenses? Healthcare (it isn't ACTUALLY FREE people), life insurance, that, with my job, I can't afford not to have; plus socking away for two college educations and a retirement. <br>  <br>  (MOST OF THE ABOVE WERE BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE --- HENCE THE HIGH COST)<br>  <br>  I could make three times as much doing this as a contractor -- and I would only work eight hour days. ****, contract to go downrange with KBR? I'd be banking. <br>  <br>  So while I'm no hero --- I am NOT in this for the money. <br>  <br>  Soon, I will deploy, and I will not see me children for fifteen months. See, we had orders BEFORE the law changed. <br>  <br>  So my kids are certainly heroes --- at least to me. <br>  <br>  My Soldiers who show up and spend all day, that's right, from 0600 to 1700, in garrison, five days a week, sometimes six or seven, working their asses off, yup, they are heroes to me. <br>  <br>  Divide all of my pay and allowances --- I make 11$ an hour. No, this isn't about money.<br>  <br>  This is about a contract that I signed, and that I am more than happy to fulfill. This is about doing what's right, and showing some integrity. It's about serving this country because I WANT to, not because I have to. It's my way of giving back. <br>  <br>  So while it isn't necessarily heroic, at least not to me, it sure beats trolling Yahoo! Answers to feel like an Internet badass.|`|FKwuuiwSaa	Not American ones. Those are just a bunch of brainwashed jackasses going out to get themselves killed for false ideals.<br>  <br>  "They're doing it for freedom, you fool!"<br>  <br>  Yeah, and tomorrow I'm gonna kill all my neighbors, but I'm doing it for Jesus, so don't you dare criticize me.<br>  <br>  Murderers.|`|txiYto2Saa	yes they are, they are defending your ignorance to say the things you do so next time you see one, buy him/her dinner or at least say "thanks."|`|tkqCT4qYaa	Depends on what they are fighting for and whether or not they are not just willing to kill for their country but die for it as well.|`|TUDZ0eY5aa	I guess even retards are entitled to their opinion.|`|2d9DFPiNaa	I think most of them are paid or not, but just like dirty cops I think some are not great people.|`|nq8pDissaa	of course they are, are you putting your self in battle to protect, oh wait your just sitting On the computer|`|NPttZlAAaa	Why dont you go be one and you tell me|`|EHzmV7cnaa	yes they r. every day when u wake up, someone is risking there life to save urs. this is why we have veterans day.|`|C5Y7tiszaa	YES....they are hero's...They need money to! they cant be fighting for us for free...some of themhave familys to!

Their sacrifices ensure you keep your right to be an ungrateful know it all. There's more to being a soldier than the measly pay. Don't mistake them with mercenaries, they aren't rich and they don't do it for themselves. They do it because they love their country, despite morons like you living in it.
sVg4Qco0aa	I think that the black people who are upset about him being called multi-racial might be take it as taking away from the great achievement that Obama has reached. The white people probably have some latent or non-latent stereotypes and prefer to identify with the fact he is half white. I think people should refer to him as whatever he chooses to describe himself as. Of course, we shouldn't get caught up in skin color or ancestry. We are all apart of the human race.<br>  <br>  The only label he needs is 44th President of the United States.|`|DiuPDS0Kaa	There are only 2 types of people making a big deal of Obama's color:<br>  <br>  1. Blacks who want to be called multiracial because they do not want to be known as black.<br>  <br>  2.  Whites who hate seeing a black man in the presidency.  <br>  <br>  So what do you call these people?? Racists.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, who cares about losers,,,who continue to beat a story over and over and over and over again.|`|cd48IIq2aa	 What is the color of coward and traitor?

My dad's elementary school was segregated for his first few years...

Some people are still stuck on stupid and have no ideal what is globalization and where we are as a country stand.  As long as this stupid crap keeps up we will continue to be behind as a Nation.   The World has open up and the average American has not given the attention that is require to encounter this global market.  We have been shackled and people are still trying to live in the past.

ppvfgdOpaa	Your community needs to come together on this one.  Police officers usually are considered above the law.   Sucks as it may, you need to go to higher, much higher grounds for this.   Its better if you have it video taped, send it to your local new station, send a copy to your local congress man or woman, send it to everyone.   Go to your community board meetings (whatever they call it when people gather) and have a dicussion about it.   You cant fight it alone, and it will take alot of people to express their disgust about their behaviors.  They should set an example and they are the first ones breaking the law without any consequences.  Call for their suspension, or even for them to resign....thats no way for police to behave.   I  think its about time for them to work FOR us...not AGAINST us. <br>  <br>  Someone I know once told me in his academy a cheif said, "it's us and then its them (refering to civilians)"   Much worse things have been said and done.  That was from the NYPD.   Goes to show how much they really care about the community. |`|cLlY0pE5aa	If the police are involved, you are screwed. Try a state lawmaker but I wish you luck on this, police patrols usually rule...|`|RzXUdu3Gaa	start up a blog and expose the pigs on youtube|`|BKJt0k6Eaa	Let them be out of control.  There is nothing you can do to challenge them.  But avoid them like the plague.  A few months ago, I was given three tickets at once.  One for driving 20 mph over the speed limit, when the speed clearly should have been 40 and I was going with the flow of traffic.  There were two lanes for each direction, plus a turning lane.  So that is five lanes.  Get this.  The speed limit was 25 mph.  He gave me a ticket for not wearing my seat belt when I was but had it under my arm.  I never had it unbuckled and he saw me pull it up over my arm as he appraoched.  Then he discovered that I neglected to change my address at Secretary of State.<br>  <br>  The prior month I was given a ticket for turning left on a red light when it was clearly green.  But I have no proof of this.<br>  <br>  With cops cracking down even harder to meet civil revenue demands, I have decided to only drive when it is absolutely necessary, change my driving insurance to recreational only, take the bus to work and walk elsewhere as much as I can.<br>  <br>  They have outlawed all pit bull breeds in my city even if they are mixed.  You must get a permit and a 6 foot high fence which encompasses your entire yard, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  We are going to see a lot more people walking and taking the bus with the way the cops are now and with the soaring gas prices.  I think this is what the cops want so no one leaves town very easily unless they are the elite class and then they are their friends any way.<br>  <br>  Writing your congressman will not help since they are all working together.  Moving to another country might help.  But really.  We all just have to wait this out.  Things are about to get a lot worse in the coming year with the economy falling apart worldwide.  Iceland has comepletely shut down according to a news article I just read.  Other countries are soon to follow.  Then civil unrest.  Things will get very very bad but as things get worse financially, the cops will not get paid and most will walk out if there is no pay.  Only the truly dedicated will stay.  After a truly terrible spell, and much horror, things will start to get better.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds insane, but if you look at things objectively, you will see it too.

When it comes to buying something for themselves only the best will do but their kids can do without for all they care . . . and this program was originally intended for the kids - not so that some baby mama can sit and keep breeding just for a bigger monthly paycheck to pay for her nails, her hair, her designer clothes, and help support whatever man has her knocked up this time around.

zptYSSjbaa	Are you talking about this rumor? <br>  <br>  Depending on who you believe, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano is in as Homeland Security secretary, or is merely at the top of President-elect Barack Obama's list, with no selection yet.<br>  <br>  Politico and the Washington Post are reporting that she has been chosen, while CNN and NBC say she is the top choice, but no offer has been made or accepted.<br>  <br>  Napolitano was one of Obama's earliest supporters among major Democratic elected officials during the primaries, and her state is on the front lines of the immigration debate. <br>  <br>  According to the Associated Press, other names thought to be in the mix are: Tim Roemer, former Indiana congressman and member of the 9/11 commission; Ray Kelly, New York police commissioner; former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig; Richard Clarke, a counterterrorism official in Republican and Democratic administrations; James Lee Witt, former FEMA director; Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Bratton, a former police commissioner in Boston; former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean, chairman of 9/11 commission; and Representative Jane Harman of California, chairwoman of Homeland Security intelligence subcommittee.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------<br>  <br>  Not the first closeted gay cabinet member ever chosen, certainly.  Not the first woman, nor the first governor.  <br>  <br>  The new administration has been taking heat for not considering enough women for the various jobs--I suppose the Napolitano and Clinton rumors are designed to tamp that down.  <br>  <br>  As for her qualifications...what are they?  She lives in a border state that is inundated with undocumented workers.  She understands the problems of insecure borders...but does she have workable solutions?  <br>  <br>  I could live next door to the ballet, it doesn't make me a ballerina.  <br>  <br>  If she is the pick, I wish her luck--she'll need it.  It's a lousy, stupid job, a bullying, unneeded layer of bureaucracy, and one I think is rather unneccessary and could be handled by the FBI, INS and border patrol, working cooperatively instead of in opposition to one another--- if they ever got their act together and became quasi-professional organizations.  |`|4iAMrHd1aa	Gov. Napolitano isn't a terrible choice.  She's primarily known for handling illegal immigration though.  Not a natural fit for Homeland Security., but maybe she will understand the value of tightening the border, being from Arizona.<br>  <br>  At least it wasn't the other choice, Jamie Gorelick.  That would have been a nightmare.  That idiot put in place the buraucratic "wall" that prevented the CIA and FBI from sharing information that would have stopped 9/11 possibly  America dodged a bullet when Obama passed over her.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	No, Napolitano is known for siding with illegal aliens.

AA12341057	In some ways they're similar, but socialism still allows for private property, where in communism the government technically owns everything.<br>  <br>  Canada is socialist; Cuba is communist.<br>  <br>  No, Obama isn't a socialist- that's just common Republican rhetoric. To be perfectly honest, with the treasuries purchasing of the banking sector, the Republicans have made the country much more socialist over the last three months than the democrats ever would. The "tax hike" that he's putting to the rich is actually just an end to some bad tax cuts made by the Bush Administration seven years ago. It returns the tax rate to where it was during the Clinton Administration, when our economy was much stronger.<br>  <br>  Democracy isn't an economic system, so it's totally possible (although never done) for a country to be both democratic and communist. |`|CmG8oTH0aa	Communism is the abolishment of Centralized Government.<br>  <br>  Its more of a political characterization.<br>  <br>  Socialism is both a market and political characterization bases on its actual aspects that are being applied.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is strictly a market characterization.<br>  <br>  <br>  Socialism is where the Centralized Government provides basics life necessities to it population based on taxes collected.  It also uses Natural Resources as a basis for wealth for the "people".  Example being, the oil in Alaska belongs to Alaskans, not the companies that find it.  <br>  <br>  Capitalism is where "the Free Market" dictates the costs of services and goods with no regulations and no federal assistance.<br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see, we don't really practice any of them, so thats why we are in this fiscal bind.|`|AA10451175	Socialism is the stage between Capitalism and Communism. It builds upon the previous system (Capitalism) by nationalizing the "means of production" (i.e. corporations, resources, banks, etc.), but not by making everyone equal. In other words, people will be paid wages based on several factors (social need, difficulty, amount of schooling required, etc.), so not everyone will make the same wage -- as is often a misinterpretation of Socialism. <br>  <br>  Communism is the point where the state "withers away." This will be quite a few years in the future. If I had to guess, I'd say at least 10 generations of established Socialism has to occur before people evolve enough to realize that hurting others or the system ends up hurting themselves. <br>  <br>  As Communists we advocate Socialism because it is the next necessary step to get to Communism.|`|rUn7TyQPaa	Yes, he is very much a socialist as any intelligent person knows. |`|eluInD1Aaa	Well there is Communist capitalism.  Russia and China is a good place to start.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Socialism is an umbrella term that encompasses the full spectrum of left-wing philosophies, the two primary ones being communism and fascism (which itself includes variations such as Nazism).  Also the term is generically used for a wide degree of socialist beliefs ranging from the far left to pretty much anything to the left mainstream liberalism.<br>  <br>  The reason so many people are opposed to socialism and frightened by it is the death toll that has followed it historically.  In the last century, socialist governments directly slaughtered 100 million people and were responsible for the deaths of 163 million more due to negligent policies.  This includes 60 million people murdered by the Red Chinese.  As many as 40+ million killed by the Soviets, including 18 million Jews.  And the victims of Nazi conentration camps as well, which number as high as 13 million.  Also, notable are the two million killed by Cambodian communists and the slaughter of an uncounted number greater than a million by the North Vietnamese (particularly a Christian Vietnamese minority known as Montagnards, who remain among the most persecuted people in the world today).  In short, socialism has a very bloody past, and those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it.<br>  <br>  And  unfortunately, yes, the White House plan to have ownership in banks is very, very close to fascism.  The "safeguard" they put into place to keep that from happening (supposedly) is that government seats on bank boards will be non-voting.  But the problem is that any future president can easily just declare those seats to be voting by executive order and we have instant nationalization of the banks!  That's a very dangerous, slippery slope!  The only other time we've been this close to losing our liberty to socialism in this country was during the FDR years, because his "new deal" was direclty borrowed from similar programs belonging to Italian fascist Benito Mussolini (who was very popular among FDR's cabinet members).  <br>  <br>  Obama has clearly said some things in the past that are VERY MUCH socialist.  Whether he actually governs as a socialist...well, I expect we will know the answer soon enough.  I personally think the answer will be "yes".  To what degree may depend on how much control his party has in congress.  The more legislation he can get through congress, the more socialist policies will be implemented, most likely.  I doubt that we will see FDR-style internment camps for undesirables under an Obama administration, but really who would have thought that FDR would do such a thing either?  <br>  <br>  Socialism is a slippery slope.  It puts largely unchecked power in the hands of leaders to arbitrarily make decisions affecting people's lives.  And  as Lord Acton once famously said, "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."  That quote is the greatest argument against socialism that can ever be written.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|wSEjN364aa	Socialism - is the economic threories of social organization to attempt an "equal" society.  They believe that capitalism unfairly gives power and wealth to a small part of society.  The list of Socialist Countries is topped with Cuba, going on to North Korea, Venezuela, China, Vietnam, Syria, and Sweden.<br>  <br>  Communist - a classless society based on common ownership.  It is a branch of socialism and the "final stage".  The government runs all business directly or indirectly.  This is the Lenin, Stalin, and Marx supported form of government.  The same countries above will be on the list if you want a country list.|`|gghOGS3xaa	Obama's not a socialist, but he has some socialist plans, Im voting for john mccain and thats one of the reasons. As for your question, its a dandy so Ill give you the basics but it would take thousands of pages. Socialism has changed and what your most interested in I think is how it applies to Obama, hes a social democrat, meaning increased government regulation, progressive taxation, and environmental protection. Capitalism is all about letting the market do its thing, entrepreneurs, more of a you get what you put in kind of system, driven by competition. Obama is sorta socialist bc he wants to take money from people who earned it through capitalism and give it to people who didnt earn it, sorta a hand out if you will. Mccain what to give a tax break to the rich, lessening the amount they owe the govt. Heres the set up, allow the people who have money to spare, stimulate the economy, as oppose to giving it to someone who doesnt have money to spare, as they will just save it or hang on to it, not spending it or helping the economy. That pretty much it. Hope I helped|`|gdRRlg6yaa	Karl Marx believed that socialism represents the transition between capitalism and communism.

They do not realize that wealth redistribution is no substitute for wealth creation. They are never taught that the only way to create wealth is for an individual to combine his energy and intellect with resources to produce a product that improves his life, or for which someone else is willing to pay. Private property, the accumulation of personal prosperity and individual achievement are anathema to socialism.

He saw three Democrats before him be LANDSLIDED by Reagan and Bush because they were too liberal, so he decided to be a "centrist," moderate Democrat, pursuing conservative fiscal policies, moderate domestic policies, conservative-moderate foreign policies, and some conservative social policies (support for the death penalty, for example). <br>  <br>  Obama, in contrast, is seen as a "liberal" Democrat, on the left, unlike both Clinton's, who are perceived as moderates. |`|l4EJtGPpaa	the Clinton's were in the white house and people don't like em, and Obama is going to be in the white house and people don't like him<br>  <br>  now the Clinton's and Obama is going to the white house together so people are really not going to like them.<br>  <br>  the difference is hillary is smarter then obama and will not push to the left to hard, while obama is dumber and will go as far as congress will allow him before they see him a problem that needs to be dealt with.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Clinton tried to govern from the far left for two years and was a dismal failure, so then he moved to the center and had some success working with the Republican Congress.<br>  <br>  If Obama tries to govern from the far left, the same thing will happen.  If he's smart, he'll learn from Clinton and stake out middle ground from day one.|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	Obama is more interested in supporting labor in America.

He is too secretive about his past for anybody to know anything about him.<br>  <br>  The Clintons however I do know about.  Bill was impeached during his presidency.  <br>  Another interesting fact about the Clinton's is both of them wrote a memoir of their lives.  That is right, a memoir of their entire lives from 2 people who cannot remember a single thing under oath.

If your a democrat, doesn't matter. The liberal media would be on your side not investigate anything. So have lots of fun, abuse woman, you can even protest in England against your own country.

Prepare to sell your soul to the Lord of Darkness.  |`|dOtQ28Ryaa	First off, remember that politics is not meant to be a career but a service to the country.If you desire to be involved in politics first find ways to serve your community. Go to the police station or fire station and see how they could use your help and contact your party in your community to volunteer. Understand where you think you should stand on issues concerning taxes, abortion,and whether you believe the government should run this country or the people should run this country.Also study all forms of government and understand how each form has effected society throughout history, not just in the U.S. but all over the world.I think it would be wise if you first serve in the military when you are 18.Get an education and a career and then go serve your country in politics.I think it is great that you are already thinking about this.Good luck and Godspeed.If you ever become president remember serve with humility not pride.<br>  |`|pBuhBGyOaa	Study history, constitutional law, serve in the armed forces, etc. Well, that's only if you want to be a decent politician.<br>  <br>  It's also helpful if you are willing to study ideas you don't necessarily agree with.

AA11101434	Nicely said. Actually, I rather enjoy the middle name, cos I kind of read it as Barack (who's sane) Obama...<br>  But I'm impressed with anyone who's not an Obama supporter but who nevertheless has the maturity to see beyond the sound-bite nonsense and scare tactics of "Ooh, scary name" or "But he's a Muslim..."<br>  <br>  If he hasn't convinced you yet that he's got a better vision for the future, and a better chance of improving the lives of Americans, than John McCain has, then as you say, nothing I say will convince you of that at this point. But nevertheless, kudos to you for your maturity of mind.|`|VpNtcji2aa	after today Hussein the closet muslim will be nothing but a bad memory and a reminder to the american voter that this was just a wake up call that we almost believed the corrupt media and almost elected the biggest fraud and disaster to ever run for potus////man that was a close one////|`|10d0bf60ff7f629065fa3139741e270daa	AMEN!

In fact, he has shown a fondness for the 2nd Amendment.<br>  <br>  He wants only SOME regulation, not outright banning.  Do you really need an uzi to protect your home?<br>  <br>  Even Charlton Heston himself said that the NRA should be open to some regulation.  Nothing is more likely to bring up talk of banning all handguns as when handguns are misused, and Heston knew that.  He favored some regulation if only to make sure that the wrong people did NOT get guns and kill people, because that would lead to more support for taking away all guns.<br>  <br>  So if Charlton Heston himself agreed with Obama's stance and adopted it as his own, I would think you could see some value in Obama's stance on this.|`|AA10071724	WHo gives a **** what he wants, he ****** up mix of commies and socialist.

Z9jtdw17aa	I'm with the two who suggested a rescued dog or one from a shelter.  <br>  <br>  It would give a great example of sharing the wealth with one less fortunate.<br>  <br>  If the animal was of mixed breeds, he'd be reaching across "party lines."<br>  <br>  It could even be black and white, to heal those old racial  wounds.  <br>  <br>  Seriously, there are millions of dogs unwanted and poorly cared for in this country, and untold numbers destroyed daily because there simply isn't room in the shelters and pounds for them.  A rescue animal properly neutered or spayed would be an example for children and their parents.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit for Britt - the child isn't "hypoallergenic."  She may have allergies.  Poodles have a reputation of being hypoallergenic, meaning less likely to cause allergic reactions.  The dog hair and dander ( shed skin cells) are what people sometimes have allergic reactions to.  Poodles seem to shed less of both.<br>  <br>  Second edit - he said in the press conference that the subject of the puppy was getting more attention than anything else on the web site.  They are trying to reconcile the need for control of allergens with the desire to have a rescue pet.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	They should get a Schipperke.

From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School. He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status. Like Obama, each of the Law School's Senior Lecturers have high-demand careers in politics or public service, which prevent full-time teaching. Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School, Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time tenure-track position, but he declined.<br>  <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/media/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/media/index....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  |`|SRo1IgiMaa	What a brilliant idea.

CzBNTeLAaa	It never was that way. It needs to be changed because way back when the Founding Fathers wrote the constitution not many people understood politics or government, unlike today, when we have so many educational resources, media outlets, etc. <br>  <br>  Article II of the Constitution lists the specifics of the Electoral College. The Founding Fathers included the Electoral College as one of the famous "checks and balances" for two reasons: 1) to give states with small populations more of an equal weight in the presidential election and 2) they didn't trust the common man (Remember, women couldn't vote then.) to be able to make an informed decision on which candidate would make the best president. <br>  <br>  So it's always been that way - that no one really needs to vote according to the Constitution. Hopefully there will be an amendment to the Constitution to keep up with the times. <br>  <br>  See here to read how the Electoral College works: <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/Politics/Vote2004/story?id=199823&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://a.abcnews.com/Politics/Vote2004/s...</a><br>  <br>  The popular vote does influence the electoral vote though, but because it's still in the Constitution, as it is (we don't even need to vote), and as we've seen in 2000/2004, the popular vote did not count because of this flaw in the Constitution.<br>  <br>  But by putting pressure on our Electors, to listen to the people, the popular vote will influence the Electors to represent the people appropriately and accurately.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Since we were founded as a country. The popular vote was not "replaced" as the electoral system was the original system.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Apparently it's always been this way.

It's been that way from the beginning.  <br>  <br>  It's because we are the United STATES (plural).  That's why we don't use a direct vote, because we're not just one state.<br>  <br>  |`|V2hIqNd9aa	The electoral college was never "removed", it's always been that way.  Basically it works like this:  The electoral votes (530 something) are divided among the states based on population.  Your state counts the votes.  The candidate in your state who gets the most votes takes ALL of the electoral votes for that state.  The candidate with the most electoral votes of all the states wins the election.  BUT he must get a minimum of 270 votes.  If a candidate failed to get the minimum of 270 votes, the House of Representatives would vote on the president.|`|G7G9liR6aa	There has never been a popular vote. Our entire system is based on giving smaller states a balanced voice in our democracy. A popular vote would give undue influence to a handful of major coastal states, and diminsh the interests of people in middle america.|`|6fcAFykbaa	yeah, it has always been that way.<br>  <br>  That is why you should not only pay attention to the presidential election, you also need people in congress that will listen to the people!|`|yN2qtTnRaa	<a href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATI...</a><br>  <br>  Because of corruption!

For the large part, most of them do not spend time really focusing on issues, or if they do, it is something far removed from mainstream life.  They spend their time on all things superficial, like appearances.  They live in a fantasy world and have little connection with reality.  So when they see Obama, they see someone who is like them...handsome and full of hype.  The way he talks appeals to people's emotions...similar to the way they act when in movies.<br>  <br>    Second, issues like taxation or government policies really do not affect the Hollywood types.  They have accountants pay their bills.  They would not notice or care if their taxes went up.<br>  <br>     Most of Hollywood is anti-war, like Obama.  They subscribe to the notion that if we are just peaceful and "talk" to nations run by evil dictators, that there will be no war.  They are, for the most part, anti-establishment and believe that anything our existing government does is bad simply because right now we have a conservative president who does not share their personal views on life.<br>  <br>     Hollywood types are mostly pro-gay, pro-abortion, and anti-Christian.<br>  Even though Obama proclaims himself as a Christian, he does not openly espouse the values most of us Christians hold dear. <br>  <br>     In fact,  Hollywood types are extremely liberal and believe in a lot of the things Obama would enact in his administration.   The unfortunate part is, these people are famous and have a lot of influence on our children, who see them as role models.  <br>  <br>  God bless America|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	I don't think too many people take Hollywood productions to be cold hard facts.

Wouldn't you get off your a** to get a free ride and a pack of smokes just for riding down to vote for obama and see his fizzle whizzle dizzle or whatever?  Especially when he's promising to give you even MORE $$$ for sitting around on your butt crying that life's not fair?  I would.  However, I work and don't want obama to "spread my wealth around."  I'd like to keep as much of it (which isn't much) for myself and my family.  I do feel sorry for the people that fall on hard times and accept govt assistance.  That's what it's for.  I do not, however, pity the fool that makes a career out of welfare or that buys a $200,000 home when he knows dang well that he can only afford a $140,000 home and I don't think it right that I have to help the irresponsible financially.|`|6JQUIZFTaa	I have not seen proof positive one way or the other.  Obama's speeches are pandering to the middle class, making them believe that he is out to help them.  In fact, that is simply not the case, but the instructions learned from the teachings of Saul Alinsky, a radical Marxist from the 1930's-1972.  The poor do not have the power.  The power is in the middle class, as more Americans fall into this category.<br>  <br>  Direct quotes taken from Alinsky's book:<br>  "My aim here is to suggest how to organize for power: how to get it and how to use it." This is not to be done with assistance to the poor, nor even by organizing the poor to demand assistance: "Even if all the low-income parts of our population were organized ... it would not be powerful enough to get significant, basic, needed changes."<br>  <br>  Alinsky advises his followers that the poor have no power and that the real target is the middle class: "Organization for action will now and in the decade ahead center upon America's white middle class. That is where the power is. ... Our rebels have contemptuously rejected the values and the way of life of the middle class. They have stigmatized it as materialistic, decadent, bourgeois, degenerate, imperialistic, war-mongering, brutalized and corrupt. They are right; but we must begin from where we are if we are to build power for change, and the power and the people are in the middle class majority."<br>  <br>  But that didn't stop Alinsky and his followers from using the middle class for their own purposes. They counted on the guilt and shame of the white middle class to get what they wanted. In order to take over institutions and get power, the middle class had to be convinced that they were somehow lucky winners in "life's lottery."<br>  <br>  Obama's whole campaign is based on pandering to the middle class, not really the upper class, and not really the lower class.  Whether or not more wealthy people or more poor people are voting for this candidate still remains to be determined by the election.  <br>  <br>  I believe that Obama will encourage the sponges to continue soaking it up and then some.  I believe that McCain will implement programs to help the lower class to be able to help themselves.<br>  <br>  |`|lutsZa81aa	McCain is the ultimate societal sponge.<br>  Growing up he: Never had to worry about food, housing, health care, education,being held accountable for his (self-proclaimed) arrogance,incompetence and immaturity. He never held a civilian job, managed a business, or had to answer for his mistakes.<br>  Every penny that fed, clothed and kept him healthy,educated and comforted him was from the pockets of the American Taxpayer.<br>  He has proven himself to be 5th from last in his graduating class, an arrogant "Richy Rich- son of an admiral with a better than thou attitude.<br>  His morals towards his first wife, his criminal involvement with friends that tried to change regulations to suit their financial scams, and his sucking up to Bush's failed policies were examples of his lack of leadership skills.<br>  His whole life has been McCain First, even as a POW he traded national secrets for special treatment.<br>  His inability to reach the common man is based in his spoiled upbringing . He has the worst flight and academic record of any Military aviator during Vietnam conflict. He also holds the record for the most present votes in the Senate.<br>  He has used his social place (provided by taxpayers) to suck up to whoever suits his agenda and his mental stability is questionable.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, The GOP represents those that have used our money to make them powerful, and McCain admits to all I have said above but feels his POW history excuses a lifetime of apathy, laziness and self-serving motives.

Furthermore, I do not like when there are people out there that are capable of working but DO NOT. Emphasis on DO NOT because they believe they can ride on everyone else's tax dollars. These people need a SERIOUS wake up call or a kick in the @$$. To answer your question Obama has represented himself for the majority of people in the country who are the hard workers - the middle class - lower mid upper.

AA10356921	I've heard the opposite. I've heard the Republicans want another round of checks and the Democrats are opposing it. I don't think we'll be getting any stimulus checks anytime soon. I wouldn't expect realistic talks about the checks until after the new administration is in place. So, don't hold your breath...I wouldn't even think of it until the spring time.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	It appears that both congress and the President are supporting another stimulus, though Nancy Pelosi is on record wanting to wait until after January to do it.  Unless she changes her mind, that means you probably won't see money before late spring at the earliest, since it would probably take 3 months to process and print the checks.|`|AUT4QSOIaa	There is another stimulus package being proposed, but that doesn't necessarily mean that people will get checks. It could be that our infrastructure will get money to create jobs, extension of unemployment benefits, or tax cuts.

And is really unnecessary, I mean really what do you accomplish in hitting the dude, do you think he'll stop saying those things because you punched him? No you're using at as an outlet for your annoyance, anger and repulsion and only sinking to his level, so by hitting him you proved your no better and no more mature then the ignorant idiot spouting off racist comments.|`|lMgDvSVCaa	I would say it is illegal to strike someone for racist comments. Even if you turned them into to cops there is really nothing they could do unless it becomes a consistent problem. Then it would be a form of harassment I believe. Then you could put a restraining order on them.  You could report it so that way if it becomes on ongoing problem they will have it on record. |`|RazLBGQZaa	Yeah, you can't really use verbal provocation as a defense.  You could sharpen your verbal skills though, and embarrass them... expose them as pitifully ignorant.  That's just as good or better (no chance of injury to yourself).  <br>  <br>  You might be able to call the cops, especially if it's in a public place like a store... but if it's any kind of context like a school or business, just document this somehow and you can get them in massive trouble.  Companies or schools just won't tolerate it; they can't.  They're afraid.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5r31rTw8aa	We fight words best with better words. <br>  We do not escalate an already dangerous situation into violence.

He wants to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine which would substantially eliminate conservative media.  He wants to increase hate speech legislation so that a minister speaking against sin as defined in the Bible in his own church, on Sunday morning, can be arrested for hate speech.  (If you think this isn't possible than you haven't been paying attention to what is happening in places like Sweden and Canada where homosexual rights trump everyone else's rights.)<br>  This is not to mention that he thinks that the US has become a fallen nation because it's offended many European nations and lost favor with them.

This means that non-combat MOS's (Military Occupational Specialty, 74D in your friend's case) face pretty much the same dangers as combat MOS's.  To answer your questions:  If they join the army/army reserves, they will probably go to war.  As a 74D they will probably not have to fight.  Possibility of losing their life?  The probability is 100% just like it is with everyone else.  Everyone dies.  But as a 74D in war the probability is very low.

yTiDX589aa	I see many weak deflections here by conservatives, as if this is all some leftist lie. I think they must be in a deep ditch of denial. Republicans are going to slowly render themselves extinct politically if they don't change many things about the direction they are taking. All one need do is look at the GOP convention compared to the Democrat convention.What was the main difference? Seemed fairly obvious to me...the Republicans didn't represent what America really is, a very diverse nation.

qzfAG3ciaa	Yes, a 2LT does outrank a 1SG. <br>  <br>  However, a 1SG has a CPT in his pocket, so it is rare for a 2LT do that because a 1SG is often speaking for the CPT.  <br>  <br>  Overall, it really depends on what the issue was.  If it was a serious matter, I would have pushed the issue.  If it was something small, I would have taken it up with the CPT.<br>  <br>  I would say the 1SG was out of line in his reaction though, he did disrespect an officer in front of the formation.  The 1SG should have been more tactful then what you said in your story.<br>  <br>  Also, the 1SG is not the second in charge of the company.  The Executive Officer is next (usually a 1LT), next by the Platoon Leaders in order of seniority.  The 1SG comes after the lowest ranking Platoon Leader.  A 2LT is higher ranking then a CSM also, but a 2LT knows a CSM usually speaks for a LTC so they usually do not challenge them.|`|RWYuN7mlaa	While the 2Lt does outrank the First Sgt, The First Sgt maintains duty schedules and taskings in coordination with his Platoon Sgts,  It is very likely that the names were provided by the Platoon Sgt in advance and the Lt had simply not communicated with the Platoon Sgt.  The  Lt without interjection should have addressed his desires to his Platoon Sgt and allowed him to coordinate the changes with the First Sgt after the fact.   This allows the First Sgt make the changes without his authority being undermined in front of the troops.  It also trains the LT to always Talk to his Sergeants before he makes changes that may be unnecessary if he is in the communications loop,       Officers Plan the Mission  NCO's Guide the troops and Execute the Mission|`|m5WpvVRhaa	When you are dealing with enlisted members at that level, rank is not the deciding factor. The 1SG is second in command when it comes to the company. The 2LT is in command of his platoon. So, position is the deciding factor for who is in command, not rank.|`|th84tcVYaa	the 1SG was most likely passing an order from the commanding officer. they'll usually use one of the highest enlisted to pass orders to everybody...|`|958426320898db76ac541de0fd9446e8aa	Your First Sgt is a SNCO and thus a mentor to junior officers in the ways of managing and leading the enlisted corps.<br>  <br>  By saying you need to learn the rank structure, he's referring to a few things:<br>  1. Your 1SG is a vital role in which he/she is a direct link (support channel) to the company commander versus you--who are just a platoon leader.<br>  2. While a lieutenant out ranks an enlisted, a Senior Non-Commissioned Officer has one leg up a junior officer when it comes to respect (custom and courtesy).  So would you interrupt a senior officer (O-4, O-5)?  Probably not, so interjecting a senior ranking officer or non-commissioned is plain disrespectful.<br>  3. An Army unit organization is structured so that a company commander (O-3 or O-4) and a 1SG is in-charge of at least two platoons...And, you're one of the Platoon Leaders who shares responsibility with a SFC.  So in esssence, your 1SG out ranks you on a structure level.|`|llqFKBpAaa	The chain of command goes up and down.<br>  <br>  You do not go directly to the 2LT and he does not go directly to you.<br>  <br>  When the 2LT was trying to make changes and give them directly to the junior soldiers, he was effectively jumping the chain down.<br>  He should make his recommendations and give them to 1SG then he should give them to you. Again, it is 1SG's company. 2LT should not be deciding tasking without it going through 1SG first.<br>  2LT forgot the 1SG was in between you and him in the rank structure.

His message is one of loving and being loved by God.<br>  <br>  I don't know everything the man is about.  But I do believe he has been unfairly characterized (and would that surprise you?  Every election year there are many people who are cut down and slandered because they have an association to a candidate).  <br>  <br>  Obama has been prepared for everything they've thrown his way in this campaign.  Wright is the one thing that caught him off-guard.  I truly believe it is because the message portrayed in the media is not the message that he associated with that church.  Think about it - Obama is smart enough to realize that if his church is that controversial and would offend so many people, he would have prepared a defense long ago.  |`|h5vHVMN1aa	First of all, as a child, you're typically dragged to church with your parents, so it's not like he had much of a choice.<br>  <br>  Religion shouldn't have any impact in my opinion on this election.  Our economy is going to hell and everyone's worried about where he went to church.  <br>  <br>  I was dragged to a Baptist church all throughout my childhood because my dad wanted me to go, and as a child MADE me go but low and behold, I'm not an atheist.  <br>  <br>  This is irrelevant to the election.|`|LCA7gdoiaa	Union man just made the best case that Obama is an aloof elitist!!!   Most of his blind followers haven't read his books loaded with racist statements.  At  the NAACP convention he declared "This is our moment - THIS IS OUR TIME!"  I guess he was only talking to the DEMOCRATS in the audience.  Read his books or at least listen to the things this guy says!!! |`|v5otljOxaa	People have a choice to go to church.  How can someone go to church BY choice for 20 YEARS, and listen to that?  I don't think that makes much sense.  I don't go to church only because I learn from the people that teach me about them.  I have learned many lessons.  I believe Tom Thunderhorse would make a good President, or Vice President.  Tom Thunderhorse treats everyone with fairness.|`|LEaBQrn8aa	He isn't racist, so your question is flawed. And I'll bet you that you have NEVER seen even one entire sermon from Reverend Wright, let alone a dozen or so. You are basing everything you say on what you have seen in edited clips. That is nothing but poor research and basing ideas on non-facts.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	To chrisWif........  I have never treated a black poorly.  I doubt many people on here have.  Being black used to be a handicap.  IT ISN'T ANYMORE!  You were never owned and I've never owned a black.  DROP THIS STUPID RACE CARD.  There's still racism everywhere.....just look at the new stand and pick up a copy of Ebony mag.  Or enter the Miss Black America pageant.  Oh, how about applying for some money to help with schooling from the United ***** College Fund.  The blacks of today have no reason to dislike whites anymore than whites have a reason to dislike them.  |`|4zbzyaPHaa	You have sat through plenty of people spitting hate.  I am sure you have a racist relative.  If you listened to his speech addressing his pastor, he answered all of your questions.|`|fA0JLVAIaa	so according to you Obama hates his white mother and his white grandparents that raised him. You're saying he's racist meaning he hates everyone of another race, don't you look like the foolish one.|`|dinQqpODaa	Good point. Obama thinks he has everyone fooled but we will see on November 4th just how many really believes his lies.<br>  November 4th is D Day and Obama will find out that not everyone believed him.|`|1oxQIMfVaa	Let's talk about important issues as the economy.<br>  <br>  This Republican mudslinging is getting old...very old.<br>  <br>  Next question.|`|bTupqDcRaa	Exactly.<br>  <br>  Now Colin Powell votes his color, but it's OK, even IF he is a Muslim!<br>  <br>  Powell just lost my confidence, what a traitor.|`|xT6YkmkIaa	So, how does this make Obama racist?  Oh, yeah, that's right: It doesn't.|`|cZIyR12eaa	exactly! <br>  no one would stay in a congregation for 20 years listening to a man and not agree with his views.|`|kzPTJa5Haa	that's why we don't vote for obama.<br>  we vote for mccain.|`|xvcADUMNaa	First I don't think Obana could be a racist, being half black and white doesn't make him a racist. Being supposed to those other racist people did alter his logical thinking. His inexperience to judge the right from wrong could be the problem. Lack to years of experience is the real trouble in him. McCain has experienced all of the racist situation and saw the pros's and con's That's the reason McCain would be a better president.|`|SRvCbAWlaa	For one thing, all of those instances of hatred by his preacher were taken completely out of context, and this was done on purpose.  <br>  <br>  Blacks in this country have a right to be angry; they are not treated fairly and I don't blame them one bit.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, before we judge, we should listen to the entire sermon.  If it is entirely racist, that's one thing.  I think that the statements made would not sound so horrible if the entire story were told, not just excerpts to poison voters minds.|`|rTqHzbaDaa	It's not, no matter what anyone says, no one has got the right to be racist it is discriminating other countries and their pride, it is not exceptable at all, and if anyone tells you different then they need to sort themselves out!!<br>  |`|sWaOWFBKaa	He is not racist, his running mate is white. When it becomes an issue a race againt the other candidate, I think you should start to question whether you are racist. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|TmaQrcJQaa	Vote for McCain, he is the best candidate for the job!

9BeUbORtaa	People tend to like their own country. Stupid people make disparaging remarks about other people's. <br>  <br>  The UK did not discover America. A Genoese man funded by Spaniards discovered the Americas. The British were Johnny-come-latelys in the colonisation of America. The Virginia settlement didn't get underway until the first decade of the 17th century. And the British hardly invented anything. The important things were all invented by the Chinese and the Arabs while the English were still living in huts.<br>  <br>  It's pretty hard to argue America has no culture if you've read Twain, Hawthorne, Steinbeck, Williams, Stevens, Fitzgerald, De Lillo, Pynchon, Moore, Pound, Ginsberg, Kerouac, Lowell, etc. Much of the world's greatest modern literature, and almost all of the world's great contemporary music, comes from the US.<br>  <br>  Though, on the other side of the ledger, I'm puzzled by the myth of British people having bad teeth. Was this ever true? Perhaps it was true in the post-war austerity years, but I really see no difference between British and American dentistry now.|`|th45yP4Xaa	<br>  the usa, we drive on the correct side of the street.<br>  <br>  But alas, there wouldn't be any Duran- Duran without the UK.|`|jbuGuNeWaa	neither is better. but.... usa doesnt copy the uk. i believe we are ahead of you. we already have a black president. watch...you are gunna copy us now.|`|ciQjwtTcaa	USA...just went down the drain.<br>  im headed to australia now. =]|`|mCbe2a67aa	I'm going to have to say USA.|`|AA12212523	Er ... isn't this an american message board?<br>  <br>  What sort of answer did you expect...|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Really? In what way does the United States copy the UK? Our two countries share a common history, but we are alike in very few ways. However, travel around the world and you will find that American culture is copied in many ways. This does not make the United States better or worse. Just different. I am a citizen of the United States, but I have traveled extensively in the world. I have yet to find another place I desire to call home.<br>  <br>  Edit: "THE UK DISCOVERED AMERICA" Wrong! An Italian named Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas funded by Queen Isabella of Spain. If you desire to go farther back than that. The indigenous population of the United Stated migrated from across the Bearing Straits during the last Ice Age. Hell even the Vikings of Scandinavian original were in the Americas before the British. You really need to study history.|`|aPtk8iEXaa	You talk funny <br>  You have bad teeth<br>  You have to support a family of Lazy Royals <br>  Your food is boring<br>  <br>  <br>  how did we copy you? alot of "you's" left the UK to help build the great USA|`|qnxAN2t5aa	we copy you? then why the heck do your lame "celebrities" keep coming over to try and get rich here. you can have who ever the hell jordan is back. and have her take "posh" with her. |`|xbCGVdiOaa	Surely there's pros and cons both ways.<br>  <br>  One thing I like about the UK is you don't have to travel so far to see a rock gig, especially if you live out in the wilds.|`|aSE64mBgaa	That's a matter of opinion. You can't really judge if you've only been in one of those two countries though.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	We have better teeth than the UK.<br>  <br>  |`|AfrBSHjZaa	how do we copy you?<br>  <br>  USA!!|`|7etaJQ6Aaa	As a English man in American I have to say BOTH. If you've never lived in the UK how can you judge?|`|wh3FWpDtaa	The UK was a good nation until the past 30 years or so. At that time, your politicians started to take away your rights, inch by inch. Now it is illegal to carry a pocket knife "without a good reason". Of course we seem similar, the US wasdescendedd from Brits angry with their country. We just took the ideals of the UK and improved them vastly. Like Rome did with Greece.|`|VeHMcyTFaa	Quit yelling! dumba** turn off your caps lock.  Oh, never mind.

As a soldier that has been to Iraq a couple of times, I have seen some of the new technologies that have been created.  I think the most beneficial to American citizen have been made in the field of medicine.  I don't think the advances made in the current war are as significant as the ones made during World War II but only time will tell.  And as far as the budget for the technology is concerned, with that too only time will tell.  But in my opinion the money being spent there could be better used somewhere else, like bailing out the losers on Wall Street.|`|iXjhrMhwaa	The majority of advancements are not created by the U.S. government.  It is done by private weapons contractors.  So there have been advancements and tons of money paid out to these contractors who create the new weapons that they sale to the military.    The money that is paid to contractors comes from tax-payers.  Now there are some who believe that wars in general are just a way for some industries to make money, and it's true to a certain degree.  Industries do make a lot of money off of wars.

But with the current situation over in Iraq, the VA has really stepped up.  If you know that he is having surgery, he should know who his doctor is and the hospital were the operation will take place.  Call the hospital and ask them about assistance and other available services they offer.  In the year after I came back from Iraq, I had two surgeries and countless other appointments.

a4xEyFi9aa	Jesse,<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear of your difficulties.<br>  <br>  Your best course if action is to see whether you can upgrade your discharge code (the thing that appears on your DD-214).  You'll probably have to provide documentation that your OCD has improved and you have been able to lead a normal life.  By the way - there is a very strong chance that you may not be able to change the code.  If that is the case, it will always be on your record.  It's still worth a shot, though.<br>  <br>  In addition, when you go to police deparments, you may want to bring a notarized statement from a psychiatrist that states that you're able to function normally.  That may help to clear up their concerns.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|icg864JUaa	I'm surprised anyone has the ability to look at you medial record, as this is confidential.

It may be a violation of law if a resolved medical condition is being used to eliminate you from consideration, although certain job series are permitted to consider prior treatments/conditions.  Law enforcement is a very high stress job, and your medical professional is probably a good judge of your situation and can recommend for or against you seeking employment in the field.  Some possible options:<br>  <br>  - get a very specific statement from your doctor indicating your OCD is under control and would not interfere with performing law enforcement duties<br>  <br>  - consider applying for related positions such as dispatcher, analyst, etc. to get in the door.

The VA explained it to me like this: there are two types of medical situations, ones done by the VA which the military doesn't know about, and the ones done by the military.  From what you said, you were diagnosed by the military.  That's not a good thing but I'm guessing that they didn't just kick you out.  I'm guessing that they put you in treatment.  If so you need the doctors that helped you to give you a clean bill of health.

I like this policy because my brother is on his second combat tour and I feel after this one he has done enough. Also if McCain gets into office he has said he will appoint more conservative supreme court justices and this will make the supreme court a conservative majority and I feel this would be bad for America.

Raising taxes drastically and plans to ruin the country with foreign government policies.<br>  <br>  Ah...smears.  You can check the obama official website.  He lists his proposed capital gains tax and even put a ceiling on it.  No more than 24% max.  If it ever gets that high, he also said he doesn't see it getting there.<br>  <br>  You have to really poke around on both their official sites for that stuff, but don't believe the smears and campaign ads.  They don't contain the facts and they bend truths or only give you half the story.<br>  For example:   <br>  "Obama wants to raise taxes"<br>  He sure does...only on the 5% of the American population that makes OVER 250,000 a year.  If you make under that, you will see ZERO increases.<br>  or "Obama is a socialist"<br>  Which translates into:  <br>  Obama wants to provide you with government issued health care (if you aren't getting it thru your job now.  You can stay with that if you like).  <br>  <br>  McCain: <br>  no tax break mentioned for anyone making under 250,000 a year has been mentioned yet.<br>  His healthcare plan:<br>  $5000 tax credit for FAMILIES with plans, 2500 for INDIVIDUALS.<br>  What most don't know:  average family of four health care plan cost is 11,000 dollars.

Income redistribution merged with nationalistic propaganda, including building a "cult of personality" around the "leader".  The introduction of a domestic "security force as well funded as the military" (Obama's SS???).  Shutting down dissenting media (fairness doctrine, Obama's indimidating TV stations with threats of losing license "once he's elected"). <br>  <br>  Obama is farther to the left than FDR was, but Roosevelt nationalized several industries and ran internment camps for American citizens.  Very Mussolini-like.  <br>  <br>  I see a lot of those same tendencies in Obama, I fear.  It all depends on how much power he actually has.

That right is innate, and the amendment is only a reminder that the government hasn't the authority to do anything about it. That's what the entire Bill of Rights is about.<br>  There is no reason for guns not to be freely available. They aren't a problem. Their misuse is a problem. I grew up in the time before the 1968 Gun Control Act, when you could order a handgun over the telephone if you wanted, or from a catalog, no problems, no "background checks." And there was less violent crime. There is to this day a definite relationship between restrictions on legal ownership of firearms and violent crime: the more restrictions, the more crime. That also holds true elsewhere. After the Dunblane incident, Great Britain put in place severe restrictions on gun ownership, the upshot being that gun crime doubled in the following decade. They're also having a spate of knife crime on top of the gun crime.<br>  It makes more sense to look at something that actually might work. The right of association would be one place that could be restricted, if you must remove some of the Bill of Rights; for instance, simply making it illegal to be in a gang could have an effect.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	i just read an article where colonial americans would be fined if they did NOT have a gun!!! tightening gun laws would only restrict law abiding citizens from owning them... the only gun control i like is a sign i saw: Gun control means, using both hands |`|YVRXdfGHaa	The only thing that should be done with the Second Amendment is add "We mean it , damn it" to the end.|`|awuGFzOPaa	Only if we "tighten" the 1st Amendment, because without the 2nd there is no 1st. <br>  <br>  The 2nd Amendment was put there to repel a tyrannical government, not for hunting or sport.

I worked at Gander Mountain here, and we weren't allowed to sell to people from those states, but they sure tried.  No, they weren't all street thugs either. <br>  <br>  Remember the types of firearms used in most crimes; semi-automatic pistols.

S3ktbzDNaa	He got a declarative judgement from the Court in 2000, the first time he ran, that a US base in Panama counts, and rightly so. I'm not voting for him, but I definately think that should constitute as a naturally born citizen. It was US territory.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To those who have pointed out that his parents were US citizens, that is irrelevant. The Court has ruled that "naturally born citizen" in the constitution, required to run for president means that you were born in the US, not that you were a US citizen at birth. I think the latter makes more sense, but it isn't the law.|`|RPeqzomsaa	he was born on a military base,that's considered American soil.  He's the son of an admiral. His citizenship isn't a question, unlike Obama who may have been born in Hawaii, or maybe Kenya, we don't know for sure and probably never will.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	He was born on an American military base, which IS considered part of the United States.  Plus, both parents were US citizens.|`|ERxADoBAaa	Wow, I can't count how many times I've seen this question.<br>  He was born to two US citizens while his father was stationed on US occupied soil in Panama.................NEXT!|`|YHmr7nvsaa	He was born here it's just before we were a country yet.|`|jzRLukgMaa	How can Obama run for President when he hasn't even handed in his Birth Certificate? You are supposed to hand that in when you get picked to run but did it happen yet... nope and if he becomes president it's already to late and doesnt have to, or has enough time to get a fake one.|`|YPHi5ww2aa	both of his parents are americans now my daughter was born in italy but both her father and i are americans we just happened to be based in italy at that time. are we going to start punishing all children of service members who are born over seas, that a tad bit despicable. have we not given enough what more do you people want, you've already got our blood on your hands now to punish our kids thats just too much <br>  okay admittedly this answer is a bit over dramatic but i mean come on think about it|`|Z29OYBQDaa	He still receives american citizenship because his parents is an american. His is a military officer stationed there. <br>  <br>  Military doesn't matter though. I was just telling why his parents were down in Panama. B. Pitt and A.

S3ktbzDNaa	As far as I know, neither candidate has anything quite that specific on tax policy. I imagine that any specific tax laws that apply to this situation would not change, but new tax cuts that apply to a home office would most likely apply to you as well. Contact a tax attorney for a more specific answer. The one income tax class I took in law school didn't quite get detailed enough to cover this.<br>  <br>  EDIT: He did not go from $250K to $200K. He has been very consistent: No tax increases below $250K. Tax cuts below $200K. The lower number Biden cited was a typical example rather than a cut-off (the more disciplined Obama would not have cited an example like that, knowing it would get misconstrued.)|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Working from home is no different to working in an office.  You will pay taxes on your income just like the rest of us.|`|HTimojDiaa	Well he went from the 250K down to 200K in a month.

If you make over $250,000 he is wanting for you to share your good fortune to others that will not get out there and put in that extra effort to earn the money. So good advice if Obama is elected, do not make over $250,000 or his plans will tax it away from you regardless if you work from your home or not.<br>  <br>  Thats what he told Joe the Plumber.|`|SYF0VHDPaa	It all depends on the gross income you earn.  Unless you're going to be earning way over $250,000 per year, I doubt there's going to be any negative impact.

They just can't decide to vote or sit home.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Because they're not really enthused about either major candidate, and are trying to figure out who will do the least damage.<br>  <br>  I believe most undecideds are currently polled to be caucasian Republicans who were primarily Hillary Clinton backers prior.<br>  <br>  This is also an unusual election in that both candidates are senators without significant executive experience prior. It's also unusual in that both candidates are campaigning against the sitting administration.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the undecideds aren't really having a problem deciding who to vote for. Most at this stage are having a problem deciding who they're most voting against.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Because ALL people are undecided until they decide.|`|A90SRsTxaa	Because both of these candidates scare the **** out of some people.|`|kpbmIxQgaa	Because every time you turn around there's something new to think about, I say go with your first pick for pres. and don't worry about the out come because after we all vote there's nothing more we can do about it|`|MPXhqffGaa	 They are waiting for Obama camp to pay them to vote for him...like the lady said ..her daughter saw Obama camp....telling some homeless people they would give them 5.00 if they would vote for him....(sarcasm)<br>     ....but true|`|31cdde9814f215ac30f204bdcb9a0ef7aa	Obviously it's because they are still making up their minds.<br>  <br>  Isn't this a rhetorical question?|`|vCXZcxyAaa	They know their screwed with either choice and just can't decide which way will be less painful.|`|MZiMOoR0aa	Because they can't decided which loser to vote for.|`|xaV4LGBAaa	   because,both cadidates change their stories almost hourly.|`|N3S9S1joaa	Its hard to choose between a turd that floats and one that doesn't.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	i don't know.  they say that 1 in 4 has already voted...|`|2KlTGAPUaa	They are trying to find this info:<br>  <br>  Senate Bill: HR 4297- Exempts those filing a joint return on $62,550 or less and those filing a single return on $42,500 or less from the alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning in 2006 (Sec. 301).<br>  <br>  Obama voted NO<br>  McCain voted Yes<br>  <br>  Obama voted in essence not to lower taxes on anyone single making $42,000 or less and married making $62,550 or less<br>  |`|jDnrmwEJaa	People claim to be undecided when they are trying to hide something.

yprHJNHAaa	OMG...Obama really understands the internet!  I doubt if McCain knows anything about it.  Well the republicans are for the rich and big business.  I think it has been proven over time that the Dems are just the opposite.  So to answer your question....yes, it is very important to vote the Dems in ...on "net neutrality" and jobs, education, energy, etc!|`|3tLW7fZQaa	Net Neutrality, to me, is the centerpiece most critically important and empassioned view I have.<br>  <br>  Censor and regulate the internet and I am voting against anyone whom votes yes on that.<br>  <br>  the internet is the leveling tool for the common people...some things simply need to remain wild and in the hands of the people fully...<br>  <br>  I am a Democrat, but if Dems start drumming the beat to kill the net, I will quickly switch parties.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	It's a red herring designed to punish telecom companies who aren't donating enough to democrats.<br>  <br>  Private property ought to rule the day.

That's what all our freedoms are based upon: control of our own destinies.<br>  <br>  |`|252488faa61d45ab5dd0a3a3b86bd138aa	Net neutrality is a very important issue, but in this election, the issue is far too nuanced for most people to consider.<br>  <br>  Once Obama is president, we'll hear more about the issue.<br>  <br>  The true patriot is an informed voter.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I believe that as it stands right now, having the freedom to download or even read information on the information is important.  However the underlying theme that you have heard throughout this election is "socialism".  Many say that Obama is a socialist, and that a Harry Reid, Obama, and Nancy Pelosi government would be a ticket straight to liberalism.  However as it relates to net neutrality, congress indeed must decide on whether to safe guard the internet or allow us as individuals to make our own choices.  Now what can happen is if, congress passes a law that allows businesses, and even government to regulate the internet more than they already do, then the role of government will increase.  Voting the Democrats in for this reason isn't the main reason why many are voting for this kind of change.  Many are tired of the same things we have received under the last 8 years.  But I do believe that regulating the internet and having freedoms restricted is on the way to a government ruled environment, and it may be coming sooner than we think. |`|pElG2K61aa	Very important. The current FCC board is stacked with GOP appointments who have tried censorship before. Pandering to the religious right, the threat of internet control by government should be very important to everyone.

You don't have to be a citizen to join the military, but you do need to become a legal resident of the US.<br>  <br>  The marines are an elite organization.  The most important thing you can do right now is to try to excel academically and physically.

You'll have to apply for one. Most people are unsuccessful, though you can get one fairly easily if:<br>  - You have a close relative who is an American citizen<br>  - An American employer is sponsoring you to come overseas and work there (works on a merit and priority system - the more qualifications you have, the better)<br>  <br>  When that's sorted, you'll need to organize a place to stay in the US and someone who is willing to sponsor you financially while you're there - this sponsor can be outside the US. Then you'll finally get a green card. So if you don't have an American relative, then you'll likely have to work very hard before you can immigrate there. Or marry a nice American girl.<br>  <br>  I read one story about an Australian that joined the US Marines and went to Iraq as a sniper. One of his parents was an American citizen, and he went ahead and immigrated there. He says in the interview that the Australian Army had no combat positions available, though I think it's a case of the local Army Reserve infantry units being full, or that his application wasn't exceptional enough to get one of the few places available in the Armoured Corps each year.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, look into other armed forces. The British Armed Forces only requires Commonwealth Citizenship since birth for entry. Yes, we have that whole Camaraderie thing in the Australian Army too, only we call it "Mateship". Depending on your unit, deployments to the Middle East are quite possible - seen pictures of those shirtless Gunners in Afghanistan yet?<br>  <br>  Hope your plans work out for you.|`|wrJ96nkFaa	The Marine Corps are amazing.  You'll have to find a way to get a green card from somewhere. Unfortunetly I dont know where. However, here in the US, we like to call it Brotherhood not so much Comradeship.  You'll have a grueling, yet powerful 13 week recruit training in MCRD Parris Island,SC. However I think you really should consider joining your country's services. Do your country proud. Here the ranks, and organization are much different.  But do your research. |`|a5cni8cqaa	I'am sure foreign nationals can join from other countries and they can become a U.S citizen by the end of it. but be warned you probably will be used as cannon fodder.<br>  <br>  for those who don't believe me<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.matt-sanchez.com/2007/11/soldiers-fighti.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.matt-sanchez.com/2007/11/sold...</a>|`|AA11652754	I was in the USMC.

Now that we have a president who is in fact black, I guess the one drop rule is obsolete.

The way he fostered a rather extreme cult of personality as the foundation of his campaign worries a lot of us, since it hearkens directly back to similar personality cults created for population control by Stalin and Castro (which would also include the virtual worship of the bloodthirsty Che Guevara we see today in fringe culture).  Obama knew this and slyly used his campaign posters to provoke anti-socialists by directly borrowing his poster design motifs from posters of Lenin, Stalin, and Che.  It could be that he was trying to needle the people who fear totalitarianism, or it could be that he looked up to the mass murderers in the original poster art he copied.  Why would he borrow from such extreme, ominous sources?  That should worry anyone who is freedom-minded.  And it didn't help things that his supporters would not tolerate any dissent.  It literally was not safe to openly oppose Barack Obama on many college campuses.  That's a fact.  The extremism of the support was literally cultish.|`|GEnKe7UBaa	It seems a poster on here thinks some people are stupid, the one that is attempting to claim it's so "hard" to get welfare.

He proposes to raise marginal rates for just about every federal tax. He also proposes a raft of tax credits that taxpayers can receive if they engage in various government-specified activities.<br>  Moreover, the tax credits would mostly go to those who pay little or nothing in federal income taxes. His trick is to make the tax credits "refundable." Thus, if the tax credit is for $1,000, but the taxpayer would otherwise only pay $200 in taxes, the government would write a check to the taxpayer for $800. If the taxpayer pays nothing in federal income taxes, the government would pay him the whole $1,000.<br>  Such credits are not tax cuts. Indeed, they should be called The New Tax Welfare. In effect, Mr. Obama is proposing to create or expand a slew of government spending programs that are disguised as tax credits. The spending on these programs is then subtracted from the total tax burden, in order to make the claim that his tax plan is a net tax cut overall.<br>  On the tax side of the ledger, the details released by his campaign last week confirm what a President Obama has in mind for our most productive citizens. The top individual income tax rate, for example, would be increased by 13%, to 39.6%; the next-highest rate would be raised to 36%. The top rates on capital gains and dividends would rise by a third, to 20%<br>  The Social Security payroll tax would be raised between 16% to 32% for families making over $250,000 a year. This means that the real returns these people get from their lifetime payments into the retirement program will be driven below 0%, according to my own previous research, which was published by the Cato Institute and elsewhere.<br>  Mr. Obama also wants a permanent federal estate tax, with a top rate of 45%; his health-insurance plan includes a new payroll tax on employers; and he also contemplates several increases in the corporate income tax, including a new so-called windfall profits tax on oil companies.<br>  Then there is the spending side of the ledger. Mr. Obama proposes a fully refundable Making Work Pay Tax Credit, which would have the government pay out $500 to each worker and $1,000 to couples -- reminiscent of George McGovern's 1972 election proposal for the government to send a $1,000 check to everyone.<br>  His American Opportunity Tax Credit would provide a $4,000, fully refundable tax credit for college tuition expenses. His Mortgage Interest Tax Credit would provide a 10% credit -- refundable -- to offset mortgage interest payments for lower- and middle-income families. His Health Care Tax Credits, which the campaign says "will ensure that health insurance is available and affordable for all families," include "a new refundable 50 percent health tax credit on employee premiums paid by employers."<br>  Currently existing tax credits would also become spending programs in the Obama tax program. The Savers Credit would be made fully refundable, and would be expanded, according to the campaign, "to match 50% of the first $1,000 of savings for families that earn under $75,000." The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit would be made refundable and expanded to allow "low-income families to receive up to a 50 percent credit on the first $6,000 of child care expenses."<br>  The Earned Income Tax Credit is already refundable. Mr. Obama would expand it to "increase the number of working parents eligible for EITC benefits, increase the benefits available to noncustodial parents who fulfill their child support obligations, increase benefits for families with three or more children, and reduce the EITC marriage penalty, which hurts low-income families." In short, welfare spending is to be increased by paying more money out to low-income income tax filers.<br>  The latest Congressional Budget Office data shows the bottom 40% of income earners already pays no income taxes. Indeed, they receive a net payment from the federal income tax system -- meaning from the taxpayers -- equal to 3.8% of all federal income taxes, because of the refundable tax credits under current law. The middle 20% of income earners, the true middle class, pays 4.4% of federal income taxes.<br>  Overall, the bottom 60% of income earners pay less than 1% of federal income taxes on net. When "tax credits" primarily go to this group in the form of checks from the government (rather than a reduction in their tax burden) it is simply an abuse of the language to call the spending a tax cut.<br>  Consequently, to say, as the campaign does say, that the candidate's tax plan is a tax cut on net -- and that it would limit taxes to 18.2% of GDP -- is grossly misleading. The Obama tax plan would sharply increase real taxes. It also would come nowhere near to paying for the massive increases in federal spending he has proposed, including the|`|joh3VNcZaa	That is incorrect.  He is cutting taxes to 95% of Americans, even though 40% of those are not paying taxes (due to income levels or deductions).  Now, these Americans are still getting their Obama check of $500 (or $1000 if they filed jointly).  That is spreading the wealth in a socialist manner - giving tax money back to people who never paid it to begin with.<br>  <br>  Conservatives do love their neighbor... more consistently than liberals.  But when it is forced from you is that really compassion?  And when it is taken from investors and businesses at a higher rate (and they are forced to cut middle class jobs and raises prices on middle class commodities) is that really compassion? <br>  <br>  There is a study you should read: "Who Really Cares More" (quoting below)<br>  <br>  "But the idea that liberals give more is a myth. Of the top 25 states where people give an above-average percentage of their income, all but one (Maryland) were red -- conservative -- states in the last presidential election. <br>  <br>  "When you look at the data," says Syracuse University professor Arthur Brooks, "it turns out the conservatives give about 30 percent more. And incidentally, conservative-headed families make slightly less money."<br>  <br>  Researching his book, "Who Really Cares", Brooks found that the conservative/liberal difference goes beyond money: <br>  <br>  <br>  "The people who give one thing tend to be the people who give everything in America. You find that people who believe it's the government's job to make incomes more equal, are far less likely to give their money away."<br>  <br>  Conservatives are even 18 percent more likely to donate blood. "<br>  |`|oTwymgpIaa	I would just like to address Pro USA. Every states welfare system is different, some states don't even have one, but in Michigan, people don't just receive a handout, in order to receive benefits they must enter into a program called workfirst within one month of applying. The program demands the person seeks work for 8 hours 5 days per week until you find employment, at which time your benefits are completely cut off, every place you apply to must be documented along with a contact person, refusal to accept a job even if it is only 2 hours per week will terminate your benefits, If you find a job working part time, you must make up the difference in a forty hour work week seeking employment, so if you work 2 hours a week you must still seek more employment for 38 hours a week. If someone offers you a job working 10 hours a week and you refuse to take it because it interferes with your 2 hour a week job you lose your benefits, Oh and did I mention gas and transportaion are your responsibility, so if you live in Lansing and someone offers you a job in Detroit working 2 hours a day, you better find a way to get there or have your benefits cut, seeings how it costs more in gas to get there then you are making, the entire concept kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it, if you keep the 10 hour a week job and quite the 2 hour a week job, you lose your benefits. It is no big secret that unemployment is high in Michigan due to all the companies that closed their doors. There are tons of families living with there parents because there is no work to be had and employers abuse this workfirst program so they can force people to work for next to nothing. I know it is gonna kill you to pay some taxes so others can eat, but don't expect me to feel sorry for you when I am forced to walk out my door and see grandma digging through a garbage can, and a young mother and her children huddled together in a cardboard box trying to keep warm. >-(|`|yTLEr3f2aa	It is the evil and dreaded socialism because your explanation is just a pumped up exaggeration of the truth. Fact is that Obama DID say that "Joe the Plumber" should spread the wealth. Now, since he said that, then I expect a check in the mail on Jan. 22 from Barack Obama himself, worth a dollar or more, and know that he mailed out more than 100 checks of the same amount to Americans that is not related to him (Family, Co-workers, nor "dear friends"). Preferably, they should go out to people like myself, who earn less than $20,000 per year. <br>  <br>  It isn't asking much. The key to it is that it be money from his pocket and not tax payer's money! C'mon. He ain't too stingy to give up $100 is he. It is the same medicine he has recommended for "Joe the Plumber".<br>  <br>  <br>  For anyone to suggest Obama is like Robin Hood, then you automaticaly admit that he is a theif! I never have got that; why people praise sin when it is still sin! "Pray for those who despitefuly use you. Do good to them."|`|JICbtNTAaa	First off, Pat Z....the uber wealthy already don't pay much in taxes and never will. Their wealth affords them lawyers and accountants who hide it more effectively than the govt could ever imagine or hire enough people to find.  Good luck with that.<br>  <br>  Obama and his cronies know this and thus put the demarcation line at $1 million, then $500,000, then $300,000, $250,000, $200,000, $150,000, $120,000, then the last one thrown around was $97,000.  See a pattern?  He's realizing that his programs can't be financed unless he goes further and further down the pay spectrum.  97K in TN is rich folk pay, but up here in NJ it's middle of the middle class.  We're already nigh the most taxed state in the union, and then to get hit like that. I already see what these fools do with my tax dollars....pensions for life on a position they were appointed to for a year. That shiz runs rampant....and God I hate it.  Here are some quotes from those much wiser than me:<br>  <br>  "Sympathy with one in suffering suppresses, for the time being, remembrance of his transgressions . . . . Those whose hardships are set forth in pamphlets and proclamations in sermons and speeches which echo throughout society, are assumed to be all worthy souls, grievously wronged; and none of them are thought of as bearing the penalties of their own misdeeds."<br>  <br>  -Herbert Spencer, "Man Against the State"<br>  <br>  "Repeal that [welfare] law, and you will soon see a change in<br>  their manners. ... Six days shalt thou labor, though one of<br>  the old commandments long treated as out of date, will again be<br>  looked upon as a respectable precept; industry will increase,<br>  and with it plenty among the lower people; their circumstances<br>  will mend, and more will be done for their happiness by inuring<br>  them to provide for themselves, than could be done by dividing<br>  all your estates among them."<br>  <br>  -Benjamin Franklin<br>  <br>  “The greatest dangers to liberty,” wrote Justice Brandeis, “lurk in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.”<br>  <br>  Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect every one who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. … O sir, we should have fine times, indeed, if, to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people! Your arms, wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone; … Did you ever read of any revolution in a nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? … Will your mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment?<br>  <br>  -Patrick Henry<br>  <br>  I lived in the South for most of my life, and hope to move back there soon. However, most all of the poverty I saw was due to bad life decisions.  You don't have to go to a state college to get an education, and a library card is free. It's all a matter of how bad you want it.  The college I went to taught me squat, yet I ended up teaching myself and got a good job making decent scratch. I grew up in a lower middle class family who was that way because of life decisions...so I know first hand. Now to have D'ohBama want to take it to give to those who didn't do the same as me? BAH!

Its now Afghanstan that is the new threat, and Obama has talked about just doing what Iraq wants us to do anyway, which is to pull out of Iraq and redeploy to Afghanistan where the actual threat is.<br>  <br>  So, unless you have been over there recently or even watch the news....keep your opinions to yourself.|`|BGZwZKXMaa	there both losers the  usa lost billions  for nothing  looking for something that wasn't there   were not suppose to be there in the first place  and the iraq lost there leader   now look at the iraq  never gonna be a country even if the usa army leaves cuz its ruined  .|`|xA0gawxoaa	Well we would and could if we would drop some payload on em instead of huntin em one at a time.

James Madison crafted the draft of the constitution, which he brought to the convention, to address this problem.  However, in the eyes of many, it concentrated too much power, so the Bill of Rights was added to specify things that the government COULD NOT DO, which effectively protects the rights of the people from their government.<br>  <br>  |`|pDU0F2QDaa	The Anti-Federalists were opposed to a strong national government (in fear of repeating what happened to them in England) and did not want a document granting so much power to the government.  The only way they could be appeased was the compromise of adding the Bill of Rights to the Constitution granting rights to each individual citizen that the government could not take away, which in turn made sure the Constitution was ratified.

iIBMrxEaaa	My dog got shot with a mini pellet dog on my neighbors property.  My dog was being aggressive but did not attack anyone.  We took them to court because my dog needed surgery to remove one the the pellets.  We sued them for hospital and surgery fees and we won regardless of the fact that the dog was on there property.  The reason was because they 1. did not alert the owners of escaped pet, 2.  did not warn us to there actions, 3.  took the law into there own hands and 4. animal cruelty.  So if I was you I would call the police and file a complaint.  If it happens again then it is your right to either have animal control seize the dog or have it put down if it attacks you or your family.  Judges really don't like people who try to hurt animals, most of them anyway.  |`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	If the dog was on your property and a threat to you or a family member, you could shoot it.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Don't shoot a dog unless you mean to kill him.  Even then, it should only be a mercy killing to put down a stray if there's no local animal control.  Anything else is cruel.<br>  <br>  In your case, shooting at your neighbor's dog with an air gun may cause your neighbor to shoot at you with a real one.|`|saVIkFOGaa	Please don't ever shoot a dog. Its not the dogs fault. Its would be extremely cruel and it would not teach the dog a lesson.You would just be causing the poor thing a lot of pain.

AZSzGvzDaa	Germany, it considered the freest known democracy by today's standards and has an exceptional economy because of it (the strongest in Europe). <br>  <br>  I think democracies with minimal standards of social welfare are the best because the produce innovation. By allowing people to maximize profits in any given sector innovators flock to these countries and provide some of the best in education, medical fields, engineering.

f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	Prior to the great depression, economic downturns were referred to as "panics".

That's where most "historical" names originate.  In the 1930's the papers were very big on hyperbole (similar to today's media in that respect), thus the "Great Depression".  <br>  <br>  There have been several other "Great Depressions" around the world.  Not just the one Americans are most familiar with.  The British had one in the late 19th Century also called the "Great Depression".  It lasted for about 20 years, in fact.

If you are all under eighteen, the inheritance might be placed in a trust until you are of age to claim it. 
5R2hTtHCaa	The UK has a superior army. Far more history and better training. Imagine what they could do with a budget similar to the US military's? |`|QuGTZJIVaa	If what coolitemseller said is true i find that quite intriguing.  To join the Parachute Regiment (UK Airborne) the training is extremely demanding and physically draining.  Most don't get through.  The Royal Marines training is said to be the toughest around, and that's before we get to the S.A.S.<br>  <br>  UK Armed forces total around 140,000 (inc reserves)  The US Marine Corps alone is closer to 200,000.  Comparing the two armies is always fruitless.  I think the reason many do it is down to the Revolutionary War and wanting to see who has progressed.  <br>  <br>  The USA were not even formed back then and the British Empire covered 1/4 of the globe.  If it were around today it would be a much closer call, even so far as to say the British were still the best.  <br>  <br>  It's also down to individual training, equipment, discipline, quality of leaders and commanders, tactical efficiency, will, concentration and ability of each individual soldier.  In some regiments the British can not be touched, but then they are let down by the quality of the equipment.<br>  <br>  Some divisions of the US Army can put the British equivalent to shame.  You could say the SEALs are the best, or the US Special Forces who are known as fierce warriors but the SAS are regarded as having the finest training, resourceful and able by many US commanders and all over the world so you can't really say which is better.<br>  <br>  Mostly it's similar to high school rivalry and banter.  It's not to be taken seriously.  You will never hear an American say the Brits are better and no British soldier would admit to the Yanks being superior.  But it's never usually in a malicious way.<br>  <br>  Both sets of soldiers are professional.  The training of each is given to the best the country has to offer, and each side compensates for what it lacks.|`|jT7Ik5a4aa	I never really understand why people ask these sorts of questions. <br>  <br>  There is no "Best".

I've been lucky enough to work with the UK paras as well as the elite SBS during time in Marine Recon and they are indeed some of the finest warriors in the world.  The simple math is that we've just got much better financing.  <br>  <br>  LT- It's rare that they get to come to OUR jump school.

We're a few hundred years younger there genius.  No, they don't have far better training as I've trained with their units.  Speak of what you know, not what you think you know.

zlmnfFpYaa	Bob Hebert has been writing Bush-hating dreck since before Bush even took office.<br>  <br>  A couple of points: Clinton's economy was already imploding in 2000.  The NASDAQ dropped by half during 2000, promising that the tech sector, followed closely by the rest of the economy, would be undergoing a traumatic decline soon.  That happened in the first part of 2001.  <br>  <br>  The War in Iraq was not an "absolutely essential response to the Sept. 11 attacks" as Bob writes, it was the second chapter in the war on terrorism, eliminating a longtime government sponser of internation terrorism.  It was a logical next step after the deposing of the Taliban in Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  The problems of Katrina were largely caused by the ineffective leadership of the Governor of Lousiana and the Mayor of New Orleans.  A properly run preparation for the oncoming hurricane would have prevented much of the misery suffered by the people there.  Any response, no matter how great, would have looked bad after that failure.<br>  <br>  Sure bad things happen, but revisionist crap like this only servers to distort the true history, not relate it as it actually was.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	This person is not a good writer and is writing for his ilk and a pat<br>  on the back,<br>  <br>  Review for example Hilliary's, and Clinton's and Kerry and even Pelosi's<br>  statements that Saddam must go.<br>  <br>  WW1 and WW2 and the Korea and VietNam wars had the US<br>  envolved by Democtats and lost by them.|`|jjt2enntaa	besides being a really BAD president he's dumber than dirt !|`|pgdTmT6caa	No this is so over done.

It's a hardcore socialist rag that has long ago been discredited in the eyes of any fair-minded people as a news source.  <br>  <br>  Bush was a pretty good president overall.  He is responsible for liberating more people from tyranny than arguably any other single person in history, because of Afghanistan and Iraq.  He presided over the six best economic years in US history too.  Plus, peventing another 9/11 is nothing short of miraculous, since stopping a second attack was considered 100 percent impossible by every expert on the planet.<br>  <br>  But Bush did have the misfortune of presiding over a recession here at the end (but one PROVEN to have been caused by Democrats, especially Barney Fwank and Christopher Dodd, two very evil men whose corruption is surpassed only by their incompetence).  <br>  <br>  And Bush's biggest failing is going along with these socialist "bailouts".

NY TIMES<br>  <br>  The invasion of Iraq was not in response to 9/11.  It was in response to a dictator not living up to the terms of a treaty he had signed with us.  Said dictator had already invaded two of his neighbors, so it was not out of the question that he would try again.  Prudence demanded that he lived up to the "unfettered access" for WMD's.   While I'll admit in hindsight that there may have been better options, we did not know this at the time.<br>  <br>  "And the U.S. economy is about as vibrant as the 0-16 Detroit Lions"  NY TIMES.<br>  <br>  For much of Bush's Presidency, economic indicators were up.  And what is up must come down.  Economies are cyclical.  While I'll be the first one to criticize Bush's deficit spending, and the negative effects it has on the economy, you can't lay the economy (good or bad) 100%  at the President's feet.  <br>  <br>  " who trampled our civil liberties at home"  - NY TIMES<br>  <br>  I haven't really noticed an erosion of my civil liberties, and I think most Americans would agree with that as well.  Besides, if our civil liberties have been trampled, why wouldn't a Democratic Congress try to overturn the Patriot Act?  Why wouldn't the Supreme Court declare the Patriot Act unconstitutional?  Maybe, just maybe . . . our civil liberties haven't been trampled.

Saddam was a ruthless dictator who had previously had WMD and had used them against his own people. He had invaded 2 neighbour states and threatened the other countries of the region. If he controlled Saudi Arabia and Kuwait he would represent a threat to the world oil supply. He had ejected the Un inspectors who were looking for WMD . The CIA, the French intelligence service and several others thought it likely that he had WMD. He told his own generals and hinted to other arab countries that he had WMD.<br>  <br>  In the end it turned out there were no WMD. Going to war over something that turned out to be incorrect is bad intelligence and bad judgement. Bad judgement does not equate to immorality, evil etc. <br>  <br>  Those who argue this is immoral say that the administration knew there was no WMD and used it as an excuse. That would qulalify as "ignoble", the evidence of the various investigations and commissions does not support this conclusion.<br>  <br>  Because Zarqawi was an agent of al Quaida and he spent some time in Iraq it was feared that Iraq might assist the terrorists against the US., since both Al Quaida and Sadaam hated the US.<br>  While there was evidence [since corroborated] that Zarqawi did in fact visit with officials in Iraq, It was thin at the time, there was plenty of evidence that sadaam was wary of al Quaida. It looked more like wanting to believe a connection existed with 9/11 on slim evidence  than a reasonable conclusion. It seems clear that Iraq had no part in 9/11. Using an emotional issue and stretching the evidence to support it doesn't look too noble.<br>  <br>  the third reason given was to rid Iraq of a ruthless dictator, give freedom to Iraqis and permit them to become an Arab democracy in the middle east. Those, who will have none of anything "noble", say this ;noble' objective was introduced after the war began. In fact the President stated this among his reasons at the outset. It is also argued that it is an impossible goal, the govt knew this, and so it was merely for show. Since we have had three elecdtions in Iraq and an elected parliament and govt it loooks like it  was sincere.<br>  <br>  Aside from thje reasons given by the adminstration for the war, to which they have remained steadfast, less "noble"  reasons are imputed. <br>  <br>  The favorite is to steal Iraq oil. While concern about oil supply was undoubtedly a part of the consideration in going to war. It was never to 'steal' oil, but concern with being freely able to purchase it on the world market unimpeded by a dictator with political motives to use the oil weapon.<br>  <br>  the evil reasons go on from there into numerous and unlikely conspiracy theories..<br>  <br>  to make oil companies rich,? to help out Bush's oil friends? to enable Bush to get reelected, to ultimately make Bush a dictator destroying the freedom of Americans.  Most of these don't stand up to rational consideration.<br>  <br>  We seem to forget in these theories that Bush will only be President for the next 2  1/2 years, and will have little authority for 2 of those years.. Conspiring to be a dictator is a non starter. While it is rational and sensible; to question the various security laws and regulations to be sure they do not infringe needlessly on our freedom, stretching it into a massive conspiracy to set up a dictatorship goes too far.<br>  <br>  I think the arguments should not be about 'ignoble reasons', but rather judgement and competence. <br>  <br>  For instance would it be noble now to abandon the fledgling Iraq democracy to civil war because the task is more difficult than was antici;pated. Dropping the "noble " concept of Iraqi democracy, however, it can be argued that American interests could be furthered by abandoning our Iraqi friends.<br>  <br>  finally there may be noble causes for war but conducting a war is hardly noble in itself.|`|8b7311ab1603cdeb193d729264ffaf0caa	I'm glad you chose this day to wake up kyle!

9e22d2cd80746424d509874140424498aa	Technically, no (assuming you are in the U.S.).  Once charges have been filed, and a warrant issued for the offender's arrest, the decision of whether to pursue the case lies with the prosecutor.  The crime is not committed "against" the victim (again technically, so bear with me) specifically, but rather, "against" the public as a whole.  In other words, once charges are filed, it's out of the victim's hands, because it's a matter of public law enforcement.<br>  <br>  As a practical matter, however, unless the offender has confessed, it will be very difficult for the prosecution to prove its case without cooperation from the victim and his/her family.  In many instances, prosecutors will not proceed without voluntary cooperation from the victim, unless, of course, the victim is being intimidated, extorted or otherwise manipulated by the offender.|`|gQVj85GDaa	my guess is that neither the minor or the parents can drop the case..............the D.A. may be required by law to proceed|`|ETLCgIgvaa	The parents can refuse to cooperate (so can the minor), but the ultimate decision to go forward with prosecution is up to the DA.

You are right in that a lot of the newly elected individuals were moderate and hopefully the things which can and will be done will be more along the mainstream of what is necessary for our nation. I do think we need a new strategy with Iraq but we can not just leave. I just hope the traditional method of the democrats is not the norm.

Also someone who is going to possibly freeze new immigration till we have a chance to fix this nightmare situation and get caught up with all the back-log of those who have abided by the law and are still patiently waiting.<br>  <br>  Secondly a crackdown on businesses with their "cheap labor" and hiring illegals and insourcing and outsourcing for the purpose of "cheap Labor" at the expense of American Citizens.<br>  <br>  There is such vast corruption in government and business and out of control spending etc. that I want to see some heads start rolling.

Kids shouldn't be having to live at home in their 20's because they work full time and can't make enough money to afford a simple apartment.  I know it depends on what area of the country you live in, but it's darned insane when basic rent's are getting close to 1000.00 a month, first last and security.  When basic utilitys equals your rent.  There needs to be a reality check.  When it takes 2 full time wage earners to get by there's a problem.  When 1 illness or 1 job loss can plummet you to homelessness.....there's a problem.  When an elderly person can't afford basic medication without choosing between eating and heat, there's a problem.

If the terrorists are over here killing us, nothing else will matter.<br>  <br>  My second issue is illegal immigration.   I'm tired of the burden that illegals are placing on our system.  I'll be looking for candidates who support penalizing businesses and landlords who hire and house illegals.  I would like to see English made our official language.

A more intellectual approach needs to be taken, that way everyone will be better off.<br>  <br>  The environment is a big thing in my mind, i'd vote for osmoen who was comitted to reducing harmful subtances in the air and promiting recycling, not just to the public, but by enforcing the big companies (i.e food packaging etc) to be more sensible with what the use/sell.|`|b004db63c6a020bbe8c0e5da9b05ddfcaa	There are lots of them, the Democrats are still trying to find one they support that isn't Bush is Hitler.

IiBBHAp0aa	If you have a college degree DO NOT Enlist. Get a comission as an officer, you could probably get an accounting job too. The pay grade you mentioned is for Enlisted members of the military, the officer wage is actually above. <br>  Decent living conditions in the states on base (you can live off of base too which many officers do)and it depends where and why you are deployed as to their quarters there. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about the ASVAB just review a little highschool math and you'll be fine, especially if you've graduated college.|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	the army is definitely an experience that you will never forget. You will learn discipiline, leadership skills and your future will have a lot more doors opened for you. If you have a Bachelors degree you can go in as officer. The E4 you are talking about is Enlisted specialist, thats not an officer.  At E5 you become a non commissioned officer, but with your degree you will become a commissioned officer. (a lot better pay,lol) On deployment living conditions just depend on where you are. You will always have atleast 1 roomate, but some times when deployed there may be a big group of you in one room. <br>  A typical year, is kind of hard to tell you. Things change so often in the army. But if you have a degree in Acct. then you will probably go into the finance dept. etc..Granted they still get deployed but not like the infantry troops. <br>  To get in you will take the ASVAB, that just tells you what mos' are open to you, and a full physical.|`|8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	You should contact your congressman/woman and check to see what the procedures are to be selected to a US military academy. You also could go to Officer Candidate School, which is a 16-week course afforded to those with degrees and with a desire to become officers, if you meet the criteria. The living conditions are very good, the food is excellent--you can eat all you want, pay is OK if you are single. If you have a degree you won't have a problem with the AFT exam (Armed Forces Test). That's more of an aptitude test to see which rate (job) would be best for you and the military. If you go into the Army and are deployed to a battle unit, you'll find the situation as you see on TV. The advantages are you get to travel, here and around the world, make great friends, make it a 20-yr career as an officer, retire at a young age, get a good pension, free medical care if you retire for the rest of your life, and many other benefits from education programs, housing loans, and many others. Negatives are what you make it. Tell your recruiter your desire to become an officer. Take advantage of your degree. (I had a chance and blew it! I regret it to this day.) Good luck.|`|70c57753438526142a2d69f6c5f094b3aa	If all you are worried about is the money and the living conditions, you will never make it.

Good Luck.|`|mEN4zGIzaa	Life is about experience, if you choose to be a soldier then be aware that you are not trying to gain wealth, but exeprience and its in your heart. <br>  <br>  The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice. This means that killing isnt a sin when it is thoroughly justified. I am not an advocate of either, but I will kill a man who enters my house in the night, but never murder a man out of jealousy or anger. It is a sin that you dont want to live with.<br>  <br>  The good part is you are brave enough to step into the shoes of a man and serve your country.

It all depends on were you are living really. FOB's (forward operating base) have the basic living necessities. Shower, beds, chow hall (if you can call it that), room (most likely with 1 other person), and a phone. Now established camps have everything you need(this includes all the above mentioned). Gyms, Internet, phones, MWR (Morale Welfare Recreation) tent, real chow hall, burger king, subway (yes they do have them in Iraq). Last but not least a PX/BX (post exchange/base exchange). As for the test its called the ASVAB. This tests your basic knowledge on everything from math to electrical circuits. So study up. As far as benefits go. If you are looking to join the Army or any other service to get rich your sadly mistaken. You get student loan repayments, Health, Dental, Finance, Bonuses, GI Bill(if you meet certain requirements).<br>  A place to live and food on the plate. Good luck and ask ask ask questions.

I am now currently in my senior year of nursing school and I have choosen to go into the Air Force as an officer. I choose Air Force so I can't tell you much about Army life. But what I do know is that if you have a degree you should really try to push for an officer position. The pay is better and living conditions are better. Plus you get more respect! As an officer yuo wouldn't have to live in the dorms you could live on or off post...on the other hand the real reason I am posting a comment is to warn you about ungratful a**holes like "tequila" who posted above me stating things such as "you will be killing thousands..., can you face God..." Here's the deal if you are going to coose a military lifestyle than you must be ready to put up with ungrateful lazy Americans who think that freedom come free...with no pricetag attatched at all. Only in America is a civilian allowed to talk like that about their country and those who defend it and get away with it. Let "tequila" take his a** over to the middle east and run his mouth like that...see how long he lasts. Anyways you will come across idiots like that but for the majority of Americans we will be proud of you and honor you. Good Luck!|`|bxF8MUOVaa	I think it's wonderful when anyone steps up to serve.  E4 is an enlisted paygrade, so if you are interested in becoming an officer DO NOT allow a recruiter to tell you that E4 is anything other than that.  I'm fairly certain that if you decide to enlist with a degree, in the Army you will be an E4.  I am an E4 (for another 4 weeks- then E5!!!), and I can tell you, it really is not a lot of money.  It's not terrible (especially if you are single) and I have enough money to do most of the things that I enjoy (pedicures, going out to pubs, shopping, travelling) but I have had my fair share of "tight" paychecks and I do not have much in the way of savings.  In some cases, if your grades out of university were not very high, you may be ineligible for Officer Candidate School (I'm not certain about that, but I do remember knowing a few people who could not get in, despite having a degree).  However, it is certainly worth checking in to.  If living conditions are important to you, you may want to consider a different branch of the service.  I am in the USAF and love it, and can attest to the fact that we really do have greater ease/better conditions than other branches.  Occasionally this bothers me (getting teased by friends in the Army or Marines) but on the other hand, I do not deal with a lot of the bs that my friends do.

From what you wrote, I am gathering that if you are the only one on the road, drive fast, kill yourself in the process, who cares, as it is your life and car. <br>  <br>  But, if you kill youself on the road, it will cost taxpayers money during the time that the police are out there "cleaning up the mess". The man hours of police on the scene, filling out all the paperwork, processing all the information, and closing the case really add up. In the end it costs the taxpayers a great deal of money if you kill yourself while speeding down the empty road. <br>  <br>  If you want to do that, my advice is go to Montana.

vKflvr4Kaa	Please don't do this - don't contact prisoners.  I worked in the corrections system for 3 years and I saw this happening a lot.  I'll speak of women contacting incarcerated males because that was the situation of my employment.  However, the reverse situation applies too.<br>  <br>  Lonely women contacting inmates is a bad situation.  The women are lonely and vulnerable.  The inmate has 24 hours per day think and craft his response to the woman to get what he wants.  Then the woman starts sending him money and working on the "outside" to help with his legal appeal of his case.  In the meantime, the woman doesn't understand that the inmate is corresponding with many who are cooperating just like herself.  The inmate gets what he's after and the woman gets a one-sided relationship with an illusion that the inmate really cares about her.  <br>  <br>  Don't forget that the inmate is incarcerated because he was found guilty of a crime and they don't always tell the truth about the nature of their crimes.<br>  <br>  If you are considering this as a method to find a friend, please consider another avenue.  I would recommend civic clubs, singles clubs, church groups, community action, classes at the community college, etc.|`|53039dc5b545e80e793402ee5fef4353aa	Friendship with a prisoner?

If you do end up paying, you have a right to the vehicle.  Run that by him and see if he will start making payments.  Otherwise, you have a right to take the vehicle, sell it and pay off the note with the profits.<br>  <br>  Also, check out the website I listed below - there is good advice there:  <br>  <br>  "You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount.<br>  <br>  The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record.<br>  <br>  This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt."<br>  <br>  Life lesson learned.

29d9ed7c569c470108c10d59dc304e08aa	Actually, waste of money may be a significant reason that state and local governments are pushing for an official language. State and local governments bear in great part the cost of supplying the multilingual resources that law requires be available to those who don't speak English. <br>  <br>  I personally don't think that argument is enough. I think it's a cover for a way to reduce the influence of immigrants. It is, however, the argument that is made. In and of itself, it makes a valid point.|`|c5aaaa7bc0de5169e89cff41344a3c80aa	English has never been established as the official language - nor has any other language.  Of course, we don't really speak English anymore - we speak a bastardized version which we can call "American."  If we spoke true English, we'd take a lift up to the third floor, we'd look under the bonnet to see why our car isn't running, UPS would deliver stuff driving a lorry and so on.<br>    <br>  The reason for having an official language is quite simple if you think about it - with the influx of legal and illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America we run the risk of Spanish becoming the predominant language in the country since they all breed like rabbits and will soon take over.  And, when you come to a country, especially if you plan on becoming a citizen of that country, you should learn to speak the language.  It should be a requirement of citizenship that you speak it.  Go to another country - they aren't going to learn English for you - same thing here, why should we learn Spanish when they've come here?  We haven't gone to them.<br>  <br>  A national language is an idea whose time has come.|`|892dfcca7bda29334c4ed11159f9cde6aa	As to standardize the requirements for public goods and signage in the U.S.  One language = lower cost to produce.|`|AA10477769	Huh?

If we were to immigrate to their home land would we receive similar treatment?<br>  The citizenship requirements must be toughened up.<br>  We will see some community eventually try to succeed from the American law some day. the financial threat of property ownership you could buy my entire county with some smart purchases.

bde6865de87df3ccd0a6f34efe6d24d9aa	This is serious load of questions...but I used to be an auto claims adjuster for Progressive.<br>  <br>  Average settlement time:  Could go forever until your lawyer settles with the insurance company or takes the insurance company to court.  Average though...3-6 months depending on how big of an A-hole the attorney is.  I'm sure the insurance company has already made an offer and that your attorney has already made an absurd counter offer to drive the "middle ground" for settleing the claim up as far as possible.  Problem is most attorneys are so darn greedy they won't accept any offer until they are close to having to go to court.  Attorney's hate going to court!  What will be covered depends on the state, but in most states the person at fault's insurance will cover all medical expenses, time missed from work (but you have to have doctors documentation that you shouldn't/can't be working) up to at fault person's liability limits.  Most are 100K per person or 300K per accident, but people with out insurance or the lowest possible legal limits are a whole nother story.<br>  Pain and Suffering are determined usually by the amount of treatment a person has.  I'm assuming you went to the hospital in an ambulance after the accident and have had multiple follow ups since.  Side note: I hope you havn't gone to a chiropractor, I always thought people were faking it if they went to a chiro instead of a real medical professional.  I would think that $25-$30K would be appropriate for pain and suffering assuming that your bills and car were taken care of also.<br>  <br>  Three things that strike me:<br>  1) You can talk to someone with you insurance company for help from someone on your side and knows the ins and outs of your states laws.<br>  2) If your bills do become a problem (even other bills) pay at least $5 toward them.  Creditors can't bother you if you are at least making some effort to eliminate what you owe them.<br>  3) I hate to say it because I know how difficult this process is, but I wouldn't make a good offer to your attorney on behalf of the at fault drivers insurance company until you have been diaganosed.  I'm very skeptical of people that claim pain and numbness but havn't been diagnosed yet after 2 months...sounds a little fishy to me.  Don't intend on being mean, but 2 months is a long time for todays doctors.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	Because you've employed an attorney...your BEST bet is to listen to the attorney who is the specialist.<br>  <br>  Because you have people wanting to be paid for services rendered...I'd STRONGLY suggest you inform you attorney and ask that he write letters to those asking for payment so that they don't see you as someone attempting to avoid payment.<br>  <br>  Additionally, as your attorney has stated...with several "litigants" involved, it takes time for companies to settle these type cases. Especially if there is a small amount of coverage. <br>  <br>  Many people cannot afford the higher rates for better coverage and only obtain minimal amounts of insurance. Once that goes...you're looking at different approaches to recovering what's owed to the "injured parties."<br>  <br>  Hang in there and use your lawyer....that's what he's getting paid for!!<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|4b4ae51e22f7a1ccbb2ef6e5f920f5e7aa	I am currently in a lawsuit myself from a car accident where the other driver was cited for the accident.  I have been going through mine now for 4 years.  My medical bills were paid (those were paid and it is something above and beyond any settlement that I will be getting) about a year into it by the insurance company that insured the driver of the vehicle I was in (I was a passenger).  Not to bring you down, but it has been a very long process and I've had to jump through many hoops to get anywhere.  The other insurance company offered a settlement of 4500.00, and that wouldn't even cover my medical bills.  My lawyer is suing for lost wages, plus pain and suffering, and also any future treatment.  <br>  You lawyer will be able to best tell you what you should or shouldn't do...and what you can sue for and what you would be able to get.  It's in your lawyers best interest to make sure you get the max that you can get. <br>  Just don't talk to the other insurance company, and if they try to contact you refer them to your lawyer.

Par contre, j'ai bien peur que votre orthographe laisse à désirer !<br>  <br>  Je travaille dans le BTP (et je suis une fille, oui), 39 heures environ par semaine. Je précise que les 16 heures supplémentaires mensuelles me sont payées, et déclarées.<br>  <br>  Je ne veux pas de Sarkozy parce que :<br>  <br>  1/ Le contrat unique, ou le CNE-CPE, ?a donne l'avantage aux grosses bo?tes. Pas au salarié ni au petit patron .... Un exemple ? Un jeune qui est venu bosser chez nous parce qu'on lui avait promis une place dans une plus grosse entreprise quelques mois après ! Il ne nous a évidemment pas prévenus, a appris beaucoup de choses, et s'en est allé en nous mettant au pied du mur... Bon pour la bo?te, ?a ? Pour démontrer les désavantages pour le salarié, je crois que je n'ai pas besoin de tellement d'arguments. Sinon, demandez et je répondrai !<br>  <br>  2/ Bosser plus pour gagner plus, oui. Mais avant cela il faudrait que les gens aient VRAIMENT le choix ! Quand on propose à une caissière de gagner 100 euros pour bosser le dimanche, qu'elle en gagne 500 par mois en temps normal alors qu'elle voudrait un temps plein (et un salaire complet) , je vois mal comment elle pourrait refuser!<br>  <br>  3/ La privatisation va remplacer les emplois stables et correctement considérés et payés par des emplois plus précaires, ce qui n'est pas bon pour les salariés concernés , et encore moins pour le pays. Je m'explique : un salarié qui sait qu'il peut se retrouver sans ressources économise, et ne consomme pas ! De même, quand on paie sa mutuelle, qu'on capitalise pour la retraite, on a plus grand chose à dépenser !<br>  <br>  4/ Le précarisation générale créée par une refonte du code du Travail va engendrer un turn-over important dans les métiers pas ou peu qualifiés... Que personne ne veut déjà faire. Donc un nombre plus important de ch?meurs (et là, soit on supprime les allocs, et les gens vont devoir capitaliser pour se prémunir du risque d'être sans ressources, soit le buget du pays explose), et encore moins de gens qui travaillent de leurs mains! <br>  <br>  Voilà , ce sont les premiers arguments qui me viennent. Une petite chose pour compléter : je crois vraiment que les gens sont d'accord pour travailler un peu plus pour leur entreprise quand ils se sentent respectés, et que le libéralisme proné par Sarkozy les considère comme une variable d'ajustement. C'est pas ?a qui va leur donner envie de se stresser, de se défoncer!|`|8d5ac273ace0764820b2c5b97ebe402baa	oui, ce sont des gens apeuraient par la perspective d'avoir à rendre un bilan professionnel et de montrer leurs valeurs, sans doute n'en n'ont ils pas d'ailleurs, donc comme l'enfant effrayé par le fait de grandir et de rentrer dans le monde adulte ils se complaisent dans un univers infantilisant qui leurs rappellent le giron maternel, ils resterons à jamais dans l'irresponsabilité juvénile!!!!|`|959553694671f7f0d7999aa5829ddfd8aa	Moi aussi les glandeurs m'horripilent.

Also, a series of cases knows as the "one man, one vote" cases ruled that districts for the House of Representatives and for the legislative districts of both houses of state legislatures had to be roughly equal in population. (This was in response to concerns about the perceived imbalance in the voting system.)

The officer may have even been miked up and have a dash camera to corroborate your story.|`|AA11606224	Explain it to a judge when you go to court.  Also you can file a formal complaint against the officer.  Like the other people said just like in any profession there is that 1% who screw it up and make the rest of us look bad.  Just go to court and fight it.  A lot of cops don't go to court, I haven't been to traffic court in 3 years, but I don't write a lot of tickets either.|`|c02fb920550b726a46713897e83a07d7aa	Joe makes a good point. Beyond what he suggested you pretty much can't do jack. Whereas he may be a 1%er cops all do stick together as a family. I am not brown but, have spent a good portion of my younger years being hassled by the police while driving. Some deserved. I had a friend whose dad was a cop. He would say that when they saw me driving they would talk about me over the radio to other cops to keep an eye out for me. They do look to hassle people on occasion. Keep your chin up!|`|3yOof2GJaa	Take his a** to court and sue him for harassment but you should have been done something about it that same day like got his bag number and contacted the police department and talk to the head chief and made a complaint but when yo go to court please make sure you have a copy of the ticket and a copy of your sticker on your tag|`|6fcdf8cf6c9fbb94a66d7e50875ea977aa	okay, here we go again. It is an unknown fact on how much police officers make on OT for sitting in court. Here in NJ the average patrol man makes 10-15k a year on OT for sitting in court for people with traffic violations. The cop wrote you the ticket because-1. He had to issue a given amount of tickets. Also he wants to collect OT by sitting in court and doing nothing. Also, do not file a complaint. If you regularly drive through that area, you will be harassed. I will soon become a police officer and know this for a fact. Filing a complaint for a seat belt ticket is just going to cause more problems for you. Also, the officer issued you the ticket because you proved him wrong. This pisses us off, you should act as though you are surprised to the fact that your inspection sticker is out of date. He is not going to issue you a ticket for this, he is not stupid and knows it is not expired. He was looking for drugs, also he was probably racially profiling. Racially profiling is part of the job. Hope that helps, seat belt tickets are rarely thrown out. Just do not make enemies with the police because they will screw you.|`|8b9c375f4300a87e545baf45bf68b3acaa	I agree with Joe, Don't listen to people that depend on the cop not showing up because 99% of the time they show up to court! But file a complaint with the police Department|`|AA11934701	First of all everybody is assuming that your version of the incident is true and accurate. My experience is that, although I will admit that sometimes a cop will make a stop based on gut reaction, but most stops are legitimate. A cop does not have to tell you why he stopped you until he has control, and he does not have to tell the real reason. If you really feel that you were singled out, then by all means contact his department.But if your complaint is not truthful , then the cop can and should sue you for slander. To many people think that you can say anything you want about a cop either true or false, but the courts now realize that the majority of citizen complaints are just "sour grapes", and they are finding in favor of the officer.|`|a0d53400bc059f8e868446561d3cab3baa	You can complain and fill out all the forms you want but the fact remains that people of color are treated unfairly by cops and it is NOT just 1% mentioned in the answer above above but more like 99% who are racists and bigots and just on power trips.  I wish it wasn't that way but I have no idea how to change it.|`|e8d4a47b06fdf23327a6dc1e93a6daeeaa	I am astounded at the judgement passed by you and the others that answered this question. Is it possible that this had nothing to do with race or harrassment and that the officer simply thought you were not wearing your seatbelt and was only doing his job? I do not know because I was not there but what you described was that you took off your seatbelt when you got stopped and the officer didn't pull you over for that but noticed that it was off when he came to your vehicle. He gave you a ticket for the seatbelt and nothing for the sticker. I think a minor seatbelt ticket is nothing to get worked up over. It's not even a moving violation and is a $55 fine in Illinois. Now, did you deserve it? Probably not if you story is true. Sometimes in life, things aren't fair. If this is the case, tell the judge. Just don't judge the officer! Officers make mistakes too. They just aren't allowed to be people sometimes.|`|f36a31d8c7aa8065d688e5bc96aa5e70aa	Go into the police department and ask for a complaint form. Make a writen complaint and photo copy it a few times. Return one to the police department and mail one to your city alderperson. If the people at the front desk will not give you a complaint form then just type a nice letter expalining the facts. Make sure you have a copy of the ticket and a photo of your sticker. <br>  Remember this is the acts of ONE person not the department. 99% of cops are good people who do a very good job. You do not hear about them in the news very much. It is the 1% like the officer you met that give police a bad name and seem to make the news alot.

sAaL9qUraa	I agree with Ken, but would add one more note:  If the ticket specifically describes another vehicle (e.g., you have a chevy and the ticket identifies a Jeep Grand Cherokee), you might prevail.  If the "error" is just a minor deviation from your correct license plate number, they would amend it at the trial and you'd be out of luck.  Your best bet would be to hope that the cop doesn't show up, in which event you simply say to the judge, "I move to have this case dismissed."|`|fe1a69ec9fc7fb7631a59c2ecba7dccdaa	None, they would amend the ticket at trial.

You should never solely look at the numbers and trust them completely.|`|29d9ed7c569c470108c10d59dc304e08aa	First off, if this is for an assignment, then the assigner might have specific expectations, so this won't be helpful at all. But these are the questions I generally ask myself.<br>  <br>  How many people were sampled? The larger the sample size, the more statistically significant it becomes. A smaller sample leaves too much room for coincidence. For example, if you sampel 5 people, and 3 of them happen to be the only 3 people in Texas that think Texas would be better smaller, you end up thinking 60% of Texans think Texas would be better smaller. And that's just silly.<br>  <br>  Second, how was the sample collected? Was it random? If you go to downtown New York and ask 20 people on the street their opinion, your sample still isn't random. People in a similar location share similar views compared to other areas. If you have an online poll, only people who want to participate do, which skews your results towards people with a strong opinion one way or another. The process of collection has a significant impact on the results.<br>  <br>  Third, what kind of questions were asked? Some questions lead people to specific answers. For example, "Do you support the President or terrorists who kill small children for fun?" leads to the result that 100% of people support the President. On the other hand, simply the question "Do you support the President?" produces a much different result.<br>  <br>  Finally, what options where people given were answering? Simple yes or no? Or degrees of agreement such as Strongly agree, somewhat agree, strongly disagree, etc? Less answer options pigeonholes people into statements they don't really agree with, but are closer to their real opinions than the other answers.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

And as far as exemptions go....they should stay.....I have two kids...so it costs me a lot more just to support my family that a person with no kids....so you would be hurting the ecnomy by taking a way a good portion of the average person's money to spend and get back into the econmy.....meaning....economy down....|`|29d9ed7c569c470108c10d59dc304e08aa	Basic economic principles may say that people who maximize their efficiency make the most money, but common sense tells us that this isn't always the case. Try looking at the golden parachutes given to CEO's who run their companies into the ground, or the amount of inherited wealth, or people who just got plain lucky. Hard work an efficiency don't get you to the top all by themselves. But that doesn't really answer your question.<br>  <br>  Two reasons why rich people are taxed more per person. (That per person is important, because the middle class still pays the majority of tax dollars.) <br>  <br>  First, they're paying for people who can't. A lot of people oppose that principle, but it's still the justification. Some people genuinely can't afford to pay taxes, while the richest 1% can afford (not saying they SHOULD, just saying that objectively they have the ability to) to lose a little more to cover the difference. I'm not sure I like this particular argument, but I do agree with the next one.<br>  <br>  Second, and more importantly, wealthy people have benefited more from the system. Their wealth is due to the system created, nurtured, and protected by the US government. As they have benefited the most from it, they should have no problem with giving the most back. Yes, they don't use welfare. Yes, they don't utitilize the same amount of phyiscal government services as poorer people. But the economic system that allowed them to bypass all of those things is only here because the US government protects it.<br>  <br>  Flat taxes are only an incentive to working harder if taxes are a DISincentive to making more money. I don't see rich people NOT making a lot of money to avoid paying more taxes.|`|4fed28bb9b0f4423a6daed9a66c58c20aa	Are you suggesting that football players, rappers, movie stars etc. are more productive than teachers, doctors, factory workers etc.?<br>  <br>  10% of a waiter's income is not equal to 10% of a multimillionaire's income. People need to have a living income and taxing the poor less than the rich (therefore keeping them on the job) is good for society. 10% of a multimillionaire's income leaves ample wealth to them, but may not be enough for the waiter and thus the waiter will end up as a burden on society.<br>  <br>  you do not seem to understand that economics is not a science, it is a philosophy, and an inexact philosophy at that.|`|AA10071534	I would agree to a flat tax as long as everyone pays their 15%.

Yeah, Paris Hilton, REAL productive.  Britney Spears, real productive.  The CEO of Enron, a very productive fellow.  Also, considering the statistical non-existance of social mobility, your assertion against inherited wealth is largely false.  Most wealth is a component of inherited wealth, as wealth provides a tremendous competitive advantage in our society.<br>  <br>  Basic progressive taxation is based on the desire to allow people to afford core necessities.  As you get to higher income levels, a smaller percentage of your income is required for things like food and shelter on a non-luxury basis (ie, that mansion is a luxury not a necessity once you get to your 8000th square foot).  In contrast, people in lower incomes need to spend nearly all of their income on core necessities, with very little remaining for discretionary spending and personal investment even with lower taxation levels.|`|f04cd0a1cb22ab0e42f3069c74fb0e0aaa	Those who earned their own wealth are the most productive.<br>  <br>  A welfare state needs the productive to support the unproductive.<br>  <br>  "From those with the greatest ability, to those with the greatest need." - Karl Marx<br>  <br>  An abolishment of coerced taxation is the solution.

50cc0cc3ef2f94280ceddd99f3cbd1e9aa	Yetti is absolutely right.  As soon as you acquire any significant property and/or have dependents (that you care about), you should have a Will.  The reason is simply to conserve your assets for your beneficiaries.  Specifically, in your Will you will direct that your Executor does not have to post a bond.  If you do not have a Will, the Probate Court is obligated by law to require a bond for your Administrator.  The premium for a bond is much more than the few hundred dollars you will pay a lawyer to draft your Will, and will be paid from your Estate's assets.  There are other reasons to have a Will of course, but this one affects everybody regardless of their net worth.|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	I am only 23 and I have one....mainly because I have kids and a home I own....and you never know whats going to happen....it does feel wierd though....but at the same time I feel better know what is going to happen to my children should something happen to me and my wife.

20a9f20e1b7197043361d68609177569aa	A prime minister is the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system. They are usually, but need not always be, a politician. In many systems the Prime Minister selects and can dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the Government. In most systems they are the presiding member and chairperson of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential system of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the President.<br>  <br>  In parliamentary systems like the United Kingdom's Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of the government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state (the King, Queen, President, or Governor-General [de facto]), although officially the head of the executive branch, is a ceremonial position. The Prime Minister is often, but not always, a member of parliament and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature. In some monarchies the prime minister also exercises executive powers (known as the Royal Prerogative) which are constitutionally vested in the Crown and can be exercised without the approval of parliament.<br>  <br>  As well as being Head of Government, a prime minister may have other roles or titles — the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for example, is also First Lord of the Treasury.[1] Prime ministers may take other ministerial posts — for example during the Second World War Winston Churchill was also Minister of Defence (although there was then no Ministry of Defence).|`|ecba5ef683780d6520401f7cb62bc11caa	Support the ministers at any time and any position.|`|VmCSWRH8aa	If you mean the Australian Prime Minister then absolute **** all decissions.

My suggestion, call the Court Clerk and ask them if you can pay the judgement directly to them and let them dispurse it, that way you have recourse later on if the bill still goes unpaid.

The vaccine is absolutely worthless as a medical treatment according to top docs in the alternative health field, and in my opinion, the so-called "science" supporting the vaccine as the only prevention for cervical cancer is an outright fraud. <br>  But the story gets even more interesting when you start connecting the dots. A key Merck lobbyist, a man named Mike Toomey, actually served as the governor's chief of staff. In other words, a former top power person for the governor now works for Merck, the drug company that gave money to the campaign of the governor who essentially used dictatorial power to mandate, without any public debate whatsoever, the mass vaccination of young girls with a drug that will earn tens of millions of dollars in profits for Merck. Sound suspicious? It should. <br>  <br>  The "dirty money connection" seems obvious to many readers who have been following this story, including one who posted, "Only a man, Rick Perry especially, would sign an executive order, bypassing legislation, to inject girls with chemicals made by one of his contributors even though most parents have never seen sufficient information about this vaccine. Perry should be impeached as a threat to the safety of our children." <br>  <br>  The humanitarian cover story<br>  Drug companies are experts at framing their profit pursuits as public health initiatives. "We have to protect the little girls!" they insist, but what's really going on behind closed doors is a far less altruistic push -- the push for profits. Requiring millions of young girls to get these new vaccines just happens to generate enormous profits for Merck. But Merck officials, and even the governor of Texas, would have you believe that has nothing to do with this. Apparently, the fact that Merck will earn obscene profits from this initiative never entered their minds. <br>  Nonsense. If Merck really wants to help these teenage girls, why don't they pledge to give away all their vaccines free of charge? In fact, if they're such a humanitarian organization, why don't they give away all their drugs, and release third world countries from patent protection at the same time? The answer, of course, is because this is all about money, not public health. If Merck was really about "patients first," they should convert to a 501(c)3 non-profit, stop paying their CEOs $10+ million salaries, and give all their drugs away for free as a gift to humankind, shouldn't they? <br>  <br>  That will never happen, of course, because it really is about the money. The sick care industry is a for-profit industry, and the more people drug companies can target as being sick today -- or even possibly someday being sick at some future date that "justifies" treatment right now -- the more money they can sock away in the bank. When it comes to money, it seems drug companies will stop at nothing to get more of it, including influencing state officials to mandate vaccine consumption policies that have nothing whatsoever to do with evidence-based medicine or genuine compassion for the health and lives of human beings. <br>  <br>  What's happening in Texas right now is a form of medical tyranny, and it's only the beginning of what may prove to be a monumental battle between personal freedoms vs. the corporate-controlled State. <br>  <br>  <br>  We must stop the medical tyranny<br>  If we let Texas get away with this medical tyranny, forcing all young girls to undergo these HPV vaccinations even against their parents' wishes, more states will follow suit. Merck is right now lobbying hard to pass similar measures in over twenty other states, and if we don't put a stop to the Texas situation, Merck will feel emboldened and likely urge other governors to make the same declarations in their states, calling it a "public health" measure but actually pocketing the profits from massive sales of these vaccines. <br>  What can you do? <br>  <br>  I say we fight the tyranny by exposing it. You can take action to spread the word on this issue. POST this cartoon to your website and LINK to our articles on this topic. We give you full permission to reprint this cartoon and forward it to your friends. Expose this medical madness before we all end up prisoners under a system of medical tyranny that turns the bodies of teenage girls into profit centers for Big Pharma! And unlike Merck, we don't care about the intellectual property royalties on this comic. Make as many copies as you want. Print up T-shirts. Add it to your book. Use it as you wish, and you don't owe me a dime. Why? Because I actually do care about my fellow human beings and I'm here to help stop the medical madness sweeping America today. <br>  <br>  <br>  Speak up now or surrender your health freedoms forever<br>  You see, if we don't stand up to this kind of medical tyranny, it will only get worse. This debate is not merely about one vaccine, it's about surrendering your health freedom to a medical system that is owned and controlled by Big Pharma. Drug companies practically run the FDA, the EPA and even control the FTC (when was the last time the FTC investigated and prosecuted drug company monopolies?). Drug companies influence the DEA to keep their own drugs legal while the exact same "street" drugs are illegal. They own our elected officials, almost all of which accepted at least some money from drug companies in their last election campaign. Drug companies also own the mainstream media by propping up television networks, cable networks, newspapers, magazines and websites with literally billions of dollars in advertising. On top of that, drug companies heavily influence the medical journals and medical schools, and have effectively limited the entire conventional medical industry to a "drugs and surgery" approach to health, practically censoring nutritional knowledge out of existence. <br>  Given this environment, is anyone supposed to believe we will see anything resembling honest debate or genuine science about this HPV vaccine? The entire industry, including drug companies, doctors, medical journals and the mainstream media, is twisting the facts to create the illusion that these vaccines are both safe and effective when, in reality, they are probably neither. Nor are they necessary. Cervical cancer is prevented in a hundred other ways, including adequate sunlight exposure and vitamin D consumption, supplementation with probiotics, adequate intake of selenium and zinc, increased consumption of trace minerals and iodine, regular physical exercise and many other safe, natural, non-patented strategies. <br>  <br>  America is being hoodwinked over the HPV vaccine. To call this anything resembling genuine public health policy is an absolute joke. It's really just a grand moneymaking scheme that exploits the bodies of young girls, marketed to look like compassionate health care. Supporters of this policy are shameless, ignorant and devious in framing their nonsensical arguments using carefully-chosen words and phrases that make them seem like they're delivering a cancer cure from God. But in reality, mandatory HPV vaccines are a deal with the devil. <br>  <br>  Consider this: With all the drugs being prescribed, all the toxic chemicals being consumed, and all the diseases now ravaging America -- a country with the highest rates of degenerative disease in the world -- does anybody really thing that injecting one more drug is the answer? You'd have to be crazy to think so. <br>  <br>  <br>  Vaccines and Immune Suppression <br>  <br>  Vaccines, all vaccines, are immune suppressing; that is they depress our immune functions. The chemicals in the vaccines depress our immune system; the virus present depresses immune function, and the foreign DNA/RNA from animal tissues depresses immunity. Toraldo, et al found that the chemotaxis and metabolic function of PMNs (polymorphonuclear neutrophils) was significantly reduced after vaccinations were given and did not return to normal for months. Other indicators of immune system depression included reduced lymphocyte viability, neutrophil hyper-segmentation, <br>  <br>  and a reduced white cell count. All vaccines are immune depressing to some extent and that is the trade-off we are risking. The medical thought is that we trade a small immune depression for an immunity to one disease. Now let me repeat, we are trading a total immune system depression (our only defense against all known disease - including millions of pathogens) for a temporary immunity against one disease, usually an innocuous childhood disease. Therefore, the trade is not at all fair. Mullins puts it this way, "Are we trading mumps and measles for cancer and AIDS." <br>  <br>  The trade-off is not worth the risk. We are risking getting many more diseases than we are "preventing" from getting. [Later we will see that there is literally no prevention.] Another good example is the ritual of the yearly flu shot. There may be only two or three varieties of flu viruses in each shot, hence the names "Asian-Flu", "Japanese-Flu" "Indian-Flu" or "Swine-Flu". But there are literally thousands, may be millions of flu-causing viruses. Taking one or two does not make sense and many people report getting the flu after taking a flu shot. We do not know which variety of flu will affect us each year and in each locale. Therefore, the best method to avoid the flu is to strengthen our immune system by eating properly and getting all the essential vitamins and minerals that our body needs. Only nutrition can build and support a strong immune system, while vaccines help to tear our immunity down. Vaccines have been linked to AIDS and other immuno-deficient disorders as well.<br>  <br>  Vaccinations depress our body's immune functions and that keeps us open to developing many other diseases. It is very childish to think that we are going to take one flu vaccine and never get sick from the many varieties of flu that exist, especially since viruses can mutate so fast when the conditions arise. Keeping up with these fast mutating viruses can only be done by priming our immune system with good nutrition and keeping the conditions/environment for their growth minimal. In other words, pathogenic viruses will not grow where the conditions will not allow it. It is the terrain which dictates our health and not the germs/viruses themselves. Germs are pleiomorphic, meaning that they can change with their environment; rods become cocci, and vice-versa. Thinking that germs cause disease means that we are not responsible for our own health and we place that responsibility in the hands of some one who has the means to kill these germs with toxic chemicals (drugs), even if those drugs/vaccines harm our body. Vaccines prevent health!<br>  <br>  Vaccinations reduce our immunity in many important ways:<br>  <br>  1) Vaccines contain many chemicals and heavy metals, like mercury and aluminum, which are in-themselves immuno-suppressing. Mercury actually causes changes in the lymphocyte activity and decreases lymphocyte viability. <br>  <br>  2) Vaccines contain foreign tissues and foreign DNA/RNA which act to suppress the immune system via graft-vs-host rejection phenomena. <br>  <br>  3) Vaccines alter our t-cell helper/suppressor ratios ... just like those seen with AIDS. This ratio is a key indicator of a proper functioning immune system. <br>  <br>  4) Vaccines alter the metabolic activity of PMNs and reduce their chemotaxic abilities. PMNs are our body's defenses against pathogenic bacteria and viruses. <br>  <br>  5) Vaccines suppress our immunity merely buy over-taxing our immune system with foreign material, heavy metals, pathogens and viruses. The heavy metals slow down our immune system, while the viruses set up shop to grow and divide. It is like being chained and handcuffed before swimming. <br>  <br>  6) Vaccines clog our lymphatic system and lymph nodes with large protein molecules which have not been adequately broken down by our digestive processes, since vaccines by pass digestion with injections. This is why vaccines are linked to allergies, because they contain large proteins which as circulating immune complexes (CICs) or "klinkers" which cause our body to become allergic.<br>  <br>  7) Vaccines deplete our body of vital immune-enhancing nutrients, like vitamin C, A and zinc, which are needed for a strong immune system. It is nutrients like these that primes our immune system, feeds the white blood cells and macrophages and allows them to function optimally. <br>  <br>  8) Vaccines are neurotoxic and slow the level of nervous transmission, and communications to the brain and other tissues. Now we know that some lymphocytes communicate directly with the brain through a complex set of neurotransmitters. Altering these factors will also depress our immunity.<br>  <br>  4) Links of Vaccines to AIDS - <br>  <br>  While the medical profession does not lightly discuss AIDS and vaccines in the same sentence, there is much evidence linking AIDS to vaccines. Buttram and Hoffman state, "Indirect immunofluorescence evaluation of T-lymphocytes from blood samples taken ... after vaccination revealed a temporary drop ... in the helper/suppressor ratio after vaccination." What that means is that immediately after vaccines are given our blood "looks" like the blood of and AIDS patient. AIDS is diagnosed when the T -cell (helper to suppressor) ratios are depressed and vaccines cause that same occurrence. Now is it any coincidence that the countries where AIDS is rampant most, are the same countries which received the most vaccinations? It is no joke when one asks, "Are we trading mumps and measles for cancer and AIDS?" <br>  <br>  When we look into vaccine production we see the links of vaccines to monkey viruses, like SV-40, which causes immuno-deficiencies (similar to AIDS) in monkeys. Some scientists feel that SIV and HIV are very similar viruses and may be one in the same. If it is found in monkeys it is called SIV and if it is found in people it is then called HIV. Very likely, it is the foreign nature of SIV which makes it deadly to our immune system and our immune system goes on the blink. Vaccinations and AIDS are clearly related, and the medical literature shows us many links to AIDS. The first Hepatitis vaccines made were notorious for causing AIDS and were made from the blood of the gay populations, who had high levels of hepatitis and AIDS. Links of AIDS to the hepatitis vaccines were numerous in the medical literature at the time (the 1970s) of the first hepatitis vaccines and people were afraid to take them for that reason. Yes, one may fear hepatitis, but we also had a greater fear of AIDS, which was more deadly and serious a condition, although many more people experienced hepatitis each year. <br>  <br>  Many other views of how vaccines started the AIDS epidemic are available, but none can be proven with any degree of certainty. Whether HIV is a disease similar to the SIV found in monkey, remains to be seen. Is SIV and HIV the same virus? Is SV-40 involved in immuno-suppression and immunodeficiency? There were reports of the smallpox vaccines delivered to Haiti, Brazil and Africa containing HIV by the London Times in 1987. Some persons have taken conspiratorial views of AIDS, but none have surfaced with any degree of veracity and it misses the point ... all vaccines are immuno-suppressive and compromise the host's immunity. Whether they contain actual HIV viruses may be disputable, they will depress the immune system. Today more care is taken in vaccine production and there are better methods of locating and removing contaminant viruses, but vaccines are still dangerous from their humble beginning and set the stage for many other diseases to follow suit many years later.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5) True Immunity: Where Does it Come From? Nutrition!<br>  <br>  Science has glossed over the most valuable point of health, ... nutrition. What is it that boosts our immune system and gives one a vibrant healthy life? ... nutrition. What is it that allows one to over -come the most devastating diseases known to mankind? ... Nutrition. What is the key factor for the recovery of disease? ... Nutrition. What is needed for the body to heal itself? ... Nutrition. What key factor prevents disease? ... Nutrition. What is missing from allopathic medicine today? ... Nutrition! It is nutrition and only nutrition which boosts our immune system and helps the body defend itself from foreign pathogens. Herbs, foods, nutrients and vitamin supplements are the tour-de-force of our immunity and it is virtually ignored by medical science in favor of drugs (chemicals).<br>  <br>  One can speculate many reasons why medical science has chosen to ignore this most important aspect of our health ... perhaps, because there is no profit in broccoli and carrots. But regardless of profit there is a side of science that altruistically searches for truth. Herbalists and naturopaths for centuries have cured devastating diseases with nature's remedies and proper diet. Medicine has shunned diet and nutrition (and herbs) as not having a place in scientific medicine. But the lowly herb can cure more than an equal share of allopathic man-made (synthetic) drugs which although originally came from many herbs are now toxic according to their dose and must be tightly regulated. <br>  <br>  The divergent paths of allopathic medicine and herbal naturopathic remedies is seen in the philosophy of vaccination. Vaccines are the only way modern medicine has to "prevent" disease for they don't believe in or use herbs or nutrition. Therefore, toxic vaccines are their only tool to "promote health". Herbalists and naturopaths, on the other hand, see the person with a totally different point of view and understanding. The person is taught how to live with nature, how to eat naturally and how to not create the environment for pathogens to grow. When the body is periodically cleansed, disease is not a problem. Allopathy desires to force health by giving the body more toxins (vaccines) to deal with in a futile and erroneous attempt at "preventing" disease. Yet, vaccines cause illnesses, many diseases, numerous disorders and set the stage for cancerous grow while depressing our body's ability to fight off pathogens. Allopathy depresses important body functions, while making the body more toxic. Naturopathy helps the body eliminate toxins while supporting the body's immune functions. <br>  <br>  Therefore, there are many points in which allopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine diverge and differ. Yet, the laws of our land only allow allopathic methods (vaccinations) of disease "prevention" and not other more effective and less damaging methods of prevention, i.e., homeopathy and naturopathy. Many religions refuse vaccines on religious grounds, because vaccines are contrary to their beliefs and vaccines are blood products grown on aborted fetuses and human and animal tissues. Vaccines grown on animal tissues, aborted fetuses, and cancer cells would be against anyone's fair judgement and common sense, regardless of religious beliefs. Therefore, it is common sense which mandates our opinions against putrid vaccines, as well as religious beliefs. <br>  <br>  It is no secret anymore that proper nutrition builds good immunity, when the medical literature is full of studies on the intimate details of our immunity as related to nutrients. The fact that nutrition plays a large role in one's health (and immune functions) can no longer be suppressed by prejudice. The over-whelming science today substantiates nutrition as a key factor in our health. Nutrition boosts our immune system like nothing else can. Field stated, "it is accepted that nutrition is important in the development and function of the immune system." Harbige noted that "Nutrition and nutritional status can have profound effects on immune functions, resistance to infection and auto-immunity in man and other animals." Scrimshaw and SanGiovanni state that "infections, ... have adverse effects on nutritional status. ... Conversely, almost any nutrient deficiency, if sufficiently severe, will impair resistance to infection." Chandra (Am J Clin Nutrition, 1997; 66(2):460s-463s) also noted, "Nutrition is a critical determinant of immune responses and malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency worldwide." Chandra and Chandra (Prog Food Nutrition Sci, 1986;10(1-2):1-65) stated that "the immune system plays a key role in the body's ability to fight infection and reduce the risk of developing tumors, autoimmune and degenerative disease." <br>  <br>  Yet, although this information is new to us now, it is not new to everyone. Many people have always maintained that a strong immune system began with good nutrition. Roger Williams, Linus Pauling, Ewan Cameron, Adelle Davis, John R Christopher, Jethro Kloss, and many other notable nutritionist have claimed nutrition was important to our health for many years, but were ignored. Profit of man-made chemicals came before the health of the patrons, many asked to suffer needlessly in the name of science when they could have been cured by a simple herbal remedy or a food. Nutrition has been down-played in the last 80 years in favor of patent-able drugs (man-made chemicals). Perhaps, the penicillin era was the greatest cause of the downfall of nutrition as a part of our health. The search for the magic bullet began with Paul Erlich's compound 606, and continues to this day. We think that cancer must be cured from without by a man-made chemical, while we ignore the inner terrain and the body's natural innate abilities (to heal) within ... governed, of course, by nutrition. Hopefully within the next decade great strides will be taken in nutrition and health to make up for lost time. Many physicians are learning nutrition and herbology and homeopathy on their own time. Their patients will be the better for it. As more nutritional oriented physicians become available, the people will have a choice and a place to turn to when in need. Nutrition Produces Health and Vitality! Vaccines Prevent Health! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6) Vaccines and Cancer -<br>  <br>  "I never saw cancer in an un-vaccinated person." <br>  <br>  Dr W B Clarke, circa 1909<br>  <br>  We don't usually associate vaccinations with cancer, but there are many citations in the medial literature where vaccines caused cancers. Sometimes cancer occurred at the site of injection and sometimes a lymphatic type of cancer would occur many years later in locations. Vaccines cause cancer. Yes, not everybody gets cancer after receiving a vaccine, but their body has been seeded with the ingredients for cancer to grow. Picture cancer as a window of opportunity. Once that window is opened, cancer can grow. Dr Vincent's work with Biologic Terrain Assessment (BTA) found that all children were pushed into the cancer "window" after vaccines were given. Now those children who don't develop cancer were (obviously) able to negate that cancer "window" with good nutrition. It is the environment which allows cancer to grow in the first place, and vaccines create that environment. When the cancer is at the site of the vaccine injection, it is hard to deny a causal relationship. Miraculously, doctors tell their patients it is co-incidental or unrelated to the vaccines. <br>  <br>  Yet, it was known in the 1800s that vaccines clog our lymphatics and contain toxic materials which could lead to disease, even cancers. Even Jenner himself had trouble with his vaccines causing diseases, and death. He was nearly lynched in one town for his specious concoctions. Our lymphatic system is designed to carry our lymphocytes throughout our body and maintain control over our cellular immunity. Therefore, the injection of large molecular sized proteins (foreign tissues in the vaccines) will clog our lymph-nodes and create problems for the lymphatic system. Therefore, it is no mystery that vaccines and lymphatic diseases, like leukemias and lymphomas, are related. <br>  <br>  "Syphilis, phthisis, scrofula, cancer, erysipelas and almost all diseases of the skin, have been conveyed, occasioned, or intensified by vaccination." Dr William Hitchman<br>  <br>  "Cancer and other vile diseases are daily inflicted on virtuous families by vaccination." <br>  <br>  Dr Edward Haughton, BAMD, MRCS <br>  <br>  "Experts say 98 million Americans who took polio shots in the 1950s and 1960s may get a deadly brain cancer from the inoculations ... Researchers at the University of Chicago Medical Center say that a virus contaminated the polio vaccine and they have now found genetic material from the virus in a number of brain cancer victims." <br>  <br>  Dr Jacob Rachlin quoted from Weekly World News of Lantana [FL] <br>  <br>  Of course, anything which depresses our immunity will eventually lead to cancer, since it is our immune system which cleanses and eliminates mutated (cancerous) cells from our body daily. If this is not done, cancers will grow and develop unchecked by our immune system. Therefore, a healthy immune system is needed to protect us from cancer and Vaccines Prevent Health.<br>  <br>  Vaccines and Auto-Immune Disease - [The injection of foreign animal DNA/RNA.]<br>  <br>  Auto-immune disease is common-place today, but were very rare just a few years ago. Does anybody wonder why one day we are healthy and the next day our body no longer recognizes our own cells as self? Could the injection of foreign animal DNA/RNA have anything to do with our epidemic rise in auto-immune disease today? Bart Classen, MD has done some remarkable research on vaccines and auto-immune diseases, especially Diabetes mellitus, which he sees as a marker disease for all auto-immune conditions. His research finds that the more that vaccinations are given the more diabetes (and auto-immune diseases) appears. Dr Classen's research found that this held true for many animal models; after receiving vaccines they experienced increases in diabetes. Then he carried his research to include vaccinated human populations. He found that in retrospective studies of vaccinations in five different human populations, this fact held true also. The more vaccines one received the more was their incidence of diabetes (and auto-immune diseases). <br>  <br>  Now it is interesting that the increases in diabetes included Juvenile-onset diabetes, which we are told today is a profoundly "genetic" disease. Yet, Dr Claussen's studies revealed that vaccinations [any vaccination] can cause increases in Juvenile-onset diabetes, too. Now one theory said that the antigenic structure of the measles/mumps virus was similar to the antigenic structure of the beta cells (which produce insulin) in the pancreas. So when our body makes antibodies to fight off measles virus, those antibodies attack the pancreatic beta cells, too. Viola diabetes! <br>  <br>  Vaccines create the foundations for auto-immune disease when foreign animal tissues are injected into our blood streams. It alters our genes ("jumping" genes) and creates havoc in our lymphatic system. Auto-immune conditions are more common today than before massive vaccination programs began in the 1940s. Auto-immune conditions such as ALS, MS, RA, and Diabetes are severe diseases and not to be taken lightly. They alter people's lives for ever and cost more than money when we consider the time involved, the stress involved, and eventually death ensues. There is even some speculation that auto-immune conditions may be behind the brain conditions they see in autism and there is some talk in the medical literature of auto-immunity to brain cells. If the body can not even recognize its own cells, then it has been tricked into thinking that those cells are no longer self. Why does this occur? Could AIDS be an auto-immune condition where the lymphocytes are reacting against each other? What about the myriad of neurological disorders, kidney disorders, blood disorders and the many diseases associated with vaccinations? When we are looking for excellent health, we need to avoid auto-immune disorders. One must remember that Vaccines Prevent Health!<br>  <br>  [Note: Dr Classen feels that Diabetes is an indicator (marker) disease for auto-immunity.<br>  <br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...<br>  <br>  How To Legally Avoid Unwanted Immunizations Of All Kinds <br>  <br>  As you read this work and put its principles into practice, there are two basic axioms you never want to forget. They are the rock upon which all your actions are based.<br>  <br>  Nobody, anywhere or any time and under any circumstances has the right or power in this country to immunize you or your children against your will and conviction. If they attempt to do so, you can legally charge them with "assault with a deadly weapon" and have the full resources of our laws behind you.<br>  <br>  At all times in attempting to avoid unwanted immunization, you have the Law of the Land behind you. Those who would try to vaccinate you against your will are on very shaky ground. Into every compulsory immunization law in America are written legal exceptions and waivers which are there specifically to protect you from the attempted tyranny of officialdom. It is not only your right, but your obligation to use them, if this is what your conscience tells you.<br>  <br>  Article I<br>  In all your contacts with any member of the school, public health, or legal establishment, always remain calm, courteous, and humbly reverent toward their position. You are only asking of them that which the law duty binds them to give you. There is no reason, or advantage, to be gained by antagonizing them. <br>  <br>  Most of these officials believe they are discharging their trust as outlined by law. If they are overstepping the law, then you must very diplomatically bring the true facts to their attention, but without attempting to belittle them. <br>  <br>  The more you can preserve their ego, the more easily and quickly you are likely to get what you desire - a waiver of immunization.<br>  <br>  Rule No. 1: Do not harass, belittle, or antagonize officials unnecessarily.<br>  <br>  Article 2<br>  All compulsory laws concerning vaccination (including the military) contain exceptions and waivers. It is these protections placed in the laws that you may legally use to exclude yourself and your children. Surprisingly, these exceptions were placed there, not for your sake (although you may take advantage of them), but for the protection of the establishment. <br>  <br>  How is this? Let us assume that these exceptions were not there and everyone was actually forced to be immunized. Should a child die or become mentally or physically disabled, the parent would have the perfect case to sue the doctor, the school, the health department, and even the state legislature for enormous damages. <br>  <br>  Since they allowed no exceptions, they must accept full responsibility for all the adverse consequences of the law. <br>  <br>  However, if exception waivers are placed in the law, the responsibility is then transferred back to the parent. If a child should be injured by immunization, the officials can say, "Well, the parent should have exempted him if they thought there was any danger."<br>  <br>  Therefore, there is in truth no such thing as a compulsory vaccination law in this country. They are ALL, in essence, voluntary. The problem is that practically no one in authority will let you know this fact.<br>  <br>  Rule No. 2: There are no compulsory vaccination laws. All are voluntary, and you are held responsible for the adverse results upon you or your children.<br>  <br>  Article 3<br>  While all immunization laws have exceptions you can use, the wording in each state differs, and you must know the exact wording for your state to make the proper request of waiver. This information can be obtained in one of two ways.<br>  <br>  Go to the reference section of your local library- look in the State Statute Revised Law Book under Public Health Law or Communicable Disease sections. The list of immunization requirements will appear first and then the exemptions will be given. Usually one or two provisions will be listed: either on religious or medical grounds or both.<br>  <br>  You may call or write your state representative and ask for a copy of the immunization laws in your state. Making this available is part of his job, and it will be sent promptly.<br>  <br>  Rule No. 3: Know your own state law so that you can conform to its exact requirements for exemption.<br>  <br>  Article 4<br>  There are two basic reasons for exception - medical or religious. Which one you choose will often depend upon the wording of the law in your state and your personal convictions. <br>  <br>  We shall discuss medical exemption first. While laws do vary, nearly all states require that a note or certificate of waiver be submitted by a physician licensed in the state of residence. In some areas where states are small and people continually travel from one to another for business, a statement from a physician in a contiguous state will be accepted.<br>  <br>  In this letter it is usually necessary to state the reason for the requested waiver and the length of time it should extend. Many laws limit all such letters to a school year and they must be renewed each fall. <br>  <br>  The two most valid reasons for medical waiver are "the fear of allergic reaction in a sensitive child" and "to prevent possible damage to a weakened immune system." Both of these can occur in a child who has been immunized, and since no one but the physician and the parent will be held responsible for their consequences, it is up to them to protect the child.<br>  <br>  It is possible that some states may require the letter from an M.D. or D.O., but many will allow an exemption letter from a chiropractor if it is courteously and properly written, as outlined above.<br>  <br>  Rule No. 4: Medical waivers are always valid but must be written to fit each state law and often need to be renewed annually.<br>  <br>  Article 5<br>  The foregoing may work for school exemptions, but are there any such waivers in the Armed Forces? Yes. All branches of the Service provide "immunization waivers." <br>  <br>  Again, if they did not you could sue them for millions of dollars if a reaction occurred from their immunizations. Because of these waiver provisions, you become responsible if you react.<br>  <br>  When you first sign up or enlist, you must state your objection to the vaccinations and tell whether it is "religious conscience" or medical reasons, such as allergies or a low tolerance to medication of any kind. If you do not show objection at this time, you have given the military the right to do what they will with you. <br>  <br>  If there is any difficulty, the same rules apply here as in the school program. Never forget, even though you may be in the Service, no one has the right to immunize you against your will. You do not give up your constitutional rights when you join the Armed Forces.<br>  <br>  Rule No. 5: The rules that govern school vaccination exemption also apply to the military. Never let anyone tell you otherwise. They do not know, or are hiding, the facts of the law.<br>  <br>  Article 6<br>  What about international travel? May I go around the world without vaccination?<br>  <br>  The World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva grants American visitors the right to REFUSE shots when traveling internationally. However, if an area you wish to enter is infected, you may be detained until the public health servant gives you the "go" (at his discretion). <br>  <br>  Thousands travel world-wide each year without shots - so you may if that is your choice. Many of our co-workers have traveled over much of the world and have never taken any immunizations, nor were they ever detained.<br>  <br>  It would be wise to request a copy of Foreign Rules and Regulations, Part 71, Title 42, on immunization when you receive your passport. Never forget the basic rule, "No one will vaccinate you against your will because by doing so they assume full responsibility for the consequences both legal and medical."<br>  <br>  Rule No. 7: You may travel wherever you wish in the world without vaccination. The worst that can happen is that in very rare circumstances you may be detained temporarily.<br>  <br>  Some Important Details<br>  The above seven articles constitute all the basic rules. However, there are many important little "tricks of the trade" to having your legal requests honored. These will now be discussed.<br>  <br>  While waivers and exemptions are written into all laws on immunization, most public health officials, doctors, and especially school officials are loathe to discuss their existence when questioned, and rarely, to our knowledge, volunteer such information. <br>  <br>  A top Philadelphia school official was on the radio with the unequivocal statement, "NO SHOTS, NO SCHOOL." <br>  <br>  This statement is of course completely counter to state law, with which presumably he is familiar. Such unwarranted dogmatism is common in the people you will encounter. Once the end of their legitimate authority has been reached, they will use their next most powerful weapon - INTIMIDATION. <br>  <br>  They will threaten to keep your child out of school, take him from you, or send you to jail. These are all idle threats because they can do none of these thing, if you follow our simple instructions. <br>  <br>  The basic rules have been given to you, but there are a few important details to be considered if the officials start on this course of unlawful intimidation.<br>  <br>  You must send a letter to the school to inform the education officials of your stand. A phone call is not legal. It can be a note from your doctor, minister, or a notarized letter from you stating your sincere objections to the immunization. If you do not do this and fail to have your child immunized, it could be construed as negligence on your part and in some states there is a possibility of legal action against you.<br>  <br>  If the school should refuse to honor your letter, request that they give you a statement in writing outlining their reasons for refusal. If they won't, their refusal is legally invalid, and your letter stands; they must enroll your child. If they do (they rarely will) they take the risk of incriminating themselves, especially if they are acting contrary (as is common) to what is specified in the law concerning your rights for exemption. Remember they are on tenuous ground, not you. They are your servants, you are not their servant. If worst comes to worst and you have a very knowledgeable official who writes you a refusal and states accurately the lawful reasons for refusal, he will also in a negative way tell you what the accepted exemptions are, and then you can go about meeting them, by one of the routes suggested in this handout.<br>  <br>  Child neglect is the one legal point you want to avoid at all costs. No legal parent or guardian can be charged with neglect unless he shows complete lack of concern or action to be more informed. Stripped of legal jargon, this simply means that if you can show that you have investigated the situation, have come to a specific decision concerning immunizations, and have informed the authorities of the same, no neglect charge can be brought. Neglect can be brought only when it can be shown that you have failed to have your children immunized, not out of respect for their medical or spiritual integrity, but only because you were too concerned with other matters.<br>  <br>  At times there may be a question of whether you have given or withdrawn legal consent. Legal consent is dependent upon being properly informed on both the advantages and the risks in any choice or decision you make. In other words, if a physician were to tell you that vaccination is perfectly safe and effective to obtain your consent, such consent would not be legal because he lied and you have not been properly informed. Conversely, it could be argued that non-consent is not legal if you are not fully informed about the risks and advantages of immunizations. <br>  <br>  What do I do if everyone refuses to give me a waiver?<br>  <br>  This would be an extremely rare circumstance. But should it happen, you are not left without resources. Here is where we pull out one of our big guns. Send notarized letters by certified mail to the vaccine laboratory which makes the shot (ask your doctor for the address), to the doctor who is to administer the shot, to your school principal,to the school board, and to your local health department. <br>  <br>  In these letters make it clear that since they have refused to give you a duly requested waiver, you can no longer be held responsible for what may happen to your child if they force these shots upon him. You then state that you will allow immunization if each will present you with a written signed guarantee of safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and that they will consent to assume full responsibility for any and all adverse reactions that your child may develop from the required shots. Of course none will give you such a guarantee. They cannot do so because all vaccines are considered potentially highly toxic. We have yet to hear of an instance of further harassment of parents after such letters have been sent.<br>  <br>  That's about all that is needed to obtain the necessary exemptions for your children. All that has been said in this last section (1 to 5) is also applicable to the military and international travel, if required.<br>  <br>  Potpourri of Ammunition<br>  "As long as each individual who opposes vaccines has sincere objections, states them in writing, and signs his name - it is considered legal and proper action and must therefore be honored."<br>  <br>  "Since many medical controversies exist surrounding immunization, drugs, and various other medications, it mandates that each individual have the right to control his own decisions and freedom of choice; anything less would be contrary to the constitutional laws that protect the citizens' rights. "<br>  <br>  "When you deal with school officials and lawyers, you are playing with legal terminology - move the wrong words around and you get hung." The terminology used in this booklet has worked before and should work again.<br>  <br>  "It is important to state your objections in such a way that it complies with your state's exemption provisions. They must then accept your request; if they do not, they are breaking their own law." That is why it is absolutely essential that you know your own state law word for word before submitting your objection.<br>  <br>  "According to CDC (the federal Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta, Georgia), physicians are required to first inform their patients of the risks involved before they consent to vaccines." If they do not do so, it is prima facie evidence of deceit or negligence on the part of the physician. <br>  <br>  This regulation by the federal government would also seem to assume that the patient has the right to refuse if he feels that the risks are too great. If this is so, is not the federal government on record as supporting voluntary immunization and, by obvious implication, against state-enforced compulsory immunization?<br>  <br>  Should you ever have to go to court, or what is more likely, to appear before a "kangaroo" court of school and health department officials, here is some class A evidence you might find useful to mention.<br>  <br>  No vaccine carries any guarantee of protection from the laboratory that produced it or the doctor who administered it.<br>  <br>  The U.S. military allows no-nonsense "immunizations waivers."<br>  <br>  There is NO FEDERAL LAW on immunizations. They don't dare. Their lawyers know the consequences.<br>  <br>  Your rights have been infringed upon by officials attempting to use force against your will.<br>  <br>  Most state officials like a nice, stress-free job. When you send in your objections and refuse to fit their ordered world by not having your children immunized, you make waves. <br>  <br>  This rocks their quiet existence, and there are only two ways their life can become orderly again: either by forcing you to their will or acquiescing to yours. What you must do to obtain an early waiver is to make the latter the easiest path for them.<br>  <br>  At first, however, an attempt will usually be made to bend you to their will by some form of intimidation. Many uninformed parents give in to this tack, and so it is tried again and again. <br>  <br>  If you are adequately informed, as a reader of this publication should be, you will let the officials know in no uncertain terms that you understand your rights under the law and will not stand for any such shilly-shallying. Invariably, once they discover you are adamant and acquainted with the state law, your waiver will be rapidly forthcoming.<br>  <br>  An Acknowledgment<br>  The greatest part of the material on the first four pages is taken from the work of Mrs. Grace Girdwain, of Burbank, Illinois. Our staff has rearranged and edited the information, but we wish the full credit for its existence to go to this courageous woman who has for twelve years worked arduously, without compensation, to help her fellow Americans obtain their legal rights.<br>  <br>  The following is an example of the state of Illionois law (where I live) relating to immunizations. Illinois, like most states has no philosophical objection, but does have a religious one.<br>  <br>  Illinois Administrative Code Title 77: Public Health<br>  Chapter I: Department of Public Health<br>  Subchapter i: Maternal and Child Health<br>  Part 665 Child Health Examination Code<br>  Subpart E: Exceptions <br>  <br>  Section 665.510 Objection of Parent or Legal Guardian<br>  <br>  Parent or legal guardian of a student may object to health examinations, immunizations, vision, and hearing screening tests, and dental health examinations for their children on religious grounds. If a religious objection is made, a written and signed statement from the parent or legal guardian detailing such objections must be presented to the local school authority. <br>  <br>  General philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical examinations, immunizations, vision and hearing screening, and dental examinations will not provide a sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements. <br>  <br>  The parent or legal guardian must be informed by the local school authority of measles outbreak control exclusion procedures per IDPH rules.

You got what you paid for.|`|956eaea88ecf59088a0f96c2cd5e5959aa	no, arrested is arrested, charged is something else.......no refund policy on bail money.|`|AA10861214	Sweetie, if you paid a bail, you were arrested and charged with something and the Judge set bail,lol.  Bails are used to release an ARRESTED person and also guarantees that the accused will show up for his/her court appearacne. Someone made an error somewhere...but I would double check, you don't need it coming back up later...deal with it now. To answer your question: Bails are refundable, minus a small adminstrative court fee, once the case has been closed and IF the accused kept all scheduled court appearances..otherwise bail is forfeited...

It is asinine to expect a police officer to fix a situation in minutes that took years to create. The parents are the first resource in this situation and when they fail, then the police are called in and if the parents and the kids don't like it, tough crap. Maybe they should have done something about the kids behavior problem a bit sooner. Police officers are not trained to be parents and some of them have never been parents, so why should they be expected to take the place of the parents especially so late in the game when the damage has already been done. My opinion is don't complain when you ask them to show up and deal with your child. Just as long as the police officer doesn't abuse his/her position with dealing with the kid.|`|tobYXCfdaa	first of all i think it is ridiculous that parenting has to be done by police officers. to give you a truly sensible answer you would have to elaborate on the question a little more. laws and police regulations vary from state to state. the definition of out of control could range from throwing temper tantrums to using deadly force against another individual. let me assure you that today's teens should be thankfull that they don't have to deal with the police officers from my generation.|`|JOq1D56Xaa	By beating the everloving hell out of the dysfunctional vermin that spawned them in their full view.

Though sometimes, police take it too far themselves, trying to intimidate and bully EVERY teen they come across or abuse their force of powers.
956eaea88ecf59088a0f96c2cd5e5959aa	that depends, if you witness say child abuse and do not report it and it is proven that you had knowledge of the crime then yes you are guilty of neglect. the same could go for murder.....it is called obstruction of justice or aiding and abiding....that also applies if you are asked about the crime and lie.  if you see a person being mugged and do nothing, that is your choice, it is a matter of morals and ethics, but you cannot be arrested for not doing anything.|`|N9pVRwkTaa	There are some good samaritan laws that require assistance to someone in need but nothing that I have ever heard of that require citizens to fight crime.

You can be held accountable under certain circumstances for failure to report a crime.  You could possibly open yourself up to a civil suit, especially if someone is injured during a commission of a crime.

FUEY6O2Iaa	You have to have experience in that kind of field first. It's not like joining the military and then being trained for your work, you have to train in that field, and then join the military. They are sending a lot of the National Gaurdsmen over to Iraq, etc right now. The best thing you could do is go and get a job at one of the large breeding/specialized-training kennels here in the US and help train the dogs that will be sent overseas. Even if you were deployed over there as a search and rescue handler, you'd have more than your fair share of killing due to the large amounts of people trying to kill you and prevent you from saving or even retrieving the bodies of your fallen comrades. In a war zone, there's really no escaping killing people. You'd also have to have military training yourself, and the dog would be more or less the equivalent of your gun. If this sounds like more than you'd want, why not join the coast gaurd? They have search and rescue, and by joining the CG, you're almost gauranteed to not go to a war zone. Only in situations like WWII would you get sent into combat. They do have similar programs, and it'd be more of a working realtionship with your animal than him as your machine.|`|6FEAEx0faa	It is a very desireable position, and you will not get to pick what type of dog you get (bomb or drug.)  You will have to be Security Forces in the AF, or MP in the Army, or PMO in the Marines (sorry I don't know what the Navy has.)  <br>  <br>  I know the AF stopped taking dog handlers straight out of basic 10 years ago.  It took my friend 5 years to get it and she was a super troop.|`|9PI25vSVaa	You do know the national guard is in Iraq too right?  You may want to focus on the Navy or the Air Force.   The national guard will train you to be a soldier.  The military is not a social welfare program.|`|RRuniB5Gaa	Well I have bad news and more bad news.<br>  <br>  First no one joins the Armed Forces just to go out and kill someone...however, if you are not able or willing to shoot to protect yourself, your teammates, or government resources the military does not want you.<br>  <br>  Also, the national guard or reserves does not have military working dogs...only active duty.  If you are only there one weekend a month who would care for your dog the rest of the time?<br>  <br>  Also, you do not get to pick what kind of dog you get. I know the Air Force does not have search and rescue dogs...only Patrol and Drug Detector Dogs.<br>  <br>  Finally, if the above was not bad enough...you don't get to join up and go right to working with dogs...you have to prove yourself for a few years before getting approved for the training.  BTW all the military working dog handlers are trained in San Antonio Texas at Lackland Air Force Base.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ku5CygN8aa	You're not going to like my answer but if you're not a "huge fan of the government" and you don't want to be in a position where you might be in a warring conflict, you should pass on trying to join the Guard or any other branch of the military. The bottom line is the military fights. You might be joining the Guard for the bennies, but when the time comes for you to do your end (ie fight), you have to do it.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in SAR, you should contact your local SAR group and find out more about joining them. With the right group, they can help you train a SAR dog too. Of course, it's probably a voluntary service, but you're likely to be happier and not find yourself in a position you don't agree with if you go that route.

MY question is WHEN DO YOU BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF?  When you DO say...I have had enough of this and I am going to do better?  When do you tell people...get off your butts and get EDUCATED!  Do you think the people that make good money are STUPID?  Do you think they just FELL into that job?  Do you think they didn't graduate from high school?  Get real...you can whine all you want about rich people...but they HAVE EDUCATION!  If you think the rich LIBERALS are worse off...is Kennedy?  Pelosi?  Any senator or democratic dentist or doctor?  They are rich....but they are EDUCATED!  EDUCATION.....is the KEY to success.  Not playing on computers and having babies when you are teens and not playing on cell phones and dropping out of school.  So stop whining about the Rich.  THANK GOD you have rich out there or you would be living in CAVES right now.  THEY are educated and smart and KNOW how to run the businesses you so blatantly disregard and disrespect.  <br>  <br>  Kids today do not want to study and work.  If you notice on Yahoo most of them can't spell or write a sentence let alone count.  They come on here and ask people to do their homework for them....would you want to hire and give people money with that kind of motivation?  NOPE!<br>  <br>  Education in America is down..and it is bad.  You can't blame the teachers..and money isn't the answer either.  You can have the poorest of schools and they have great attendence and great testing and the best students...and you have new schools where one in three don't graduate and the rest are barely hanging in there.  WHY?<br>  <br>  They don't want to do the work.  They are busy with play stations...cell phones in class, etc.  My son is a teacher and he spends most of his time babysitting....you can't discpline them....you can't make them grow up or the parents are all over you.  You can't help the little ones onto the bus because God Forbid someone will say you are molesting them.!  My son is also the head coach of the basketball team at that High School and you wouldn't believe the hassle he has with parents telling him he is a racist because he expects and demands his students have passing grades and not be in trouble.  When some of them stole from another school , he threw them off the team...and the rest of the team went to that school and did community service work to make up for the damage and the money the other ones did.  The parents were OUTRAGED that their kids were not allowed to go to parties and take their babies to the doctor appt. <br>  <br>  It is an inner city school.....and LOTS of problems..but it is a NEW SCHOOL with all computers and opportunities to them.  A teacher was fired for telling the kids to pick it up , zip it up and shut it up..referring to the F word and pants that were hanging down to the ground so badly they couldn't' carry their books for holding up their drawers.<br>  <br>  Parents wont' discipline and they won't make them study and they allow them to have babies while in high school...but don't tell them to act like adults.<br>  <br>  The rich...name them!  Educated....hard working....amtitious and talented.  They WORK for their money...they earn it.<br>  <br>  If poverty is the result of lower wages..then it is also the result of no education or poor skills.  Instead of being educated..instead of working two jobs if needed......they yell the rich have it so good.<br>  <br>  When doctors and lawyers etc spend their childhood getting good grades and getting scholarships..when they spend 10 years in college ...most of them working while going to college.....you can't deny they EARN the higher wages.  <br>  <br>  Higher wages come from EDUCATION.....<br>  <br>  Tell the parents to do something about their kids...make them responsible!<br>  <br>  Ok...there are some that need help.  I have no problem with that...but to give HIGHER wages to those that have the education and put thousands of dollars into their education is wrong.  <br>  <br>  If I had a business I would certainly pay higher wages to someone who KNOWs what is going on ...over someone who barely made it through high school or didn't want to finish.<br>  <br>  I know I would pay a LOT more to go to a dentist that went to school over someone who didn't graduate!

As president, Obama will further raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2011, index it to inflation and increase the Earned Income Tax Credit to make sure that full-time workers can earn a living wage that allows them to raise their families and pay for basic needs such as food, transportation, and housing - things so many people take for granted. <br>  |`|73c0175bdd3fd6f3ebd360bd47445ee7aa	Anna P you said "MOST poor people DO work, that's the sad part.

There is this faith that if we take care of the coporations, the corporations will take care of the citizens.  Raising workers' wages puts a perceived hardship on the businesses.  Years ago, my parents and brother owned a pizza chain franchise, and my folks were very much against raising the minimum wage because it would negatively impact their bottom line for the business.  Their livelihood would be impacted if they had to pay out more to their employees and their profits went down. The catch-22, though, is that if people make more money, they may have more disposable income, which means they may be able to buy more pizza (for example), thereby causing my parents' profits to go up.  By the same token, of course, the argument could be raised that if the coporations are forced to raise wages for their employees, it could ultimately cut into the bottom line deeply enough that it forces them to lay off workers, which would do our economy no good, either.  People without jobs can't spend, and consumer spending is some 70% of our national economy.<br>  <br>  Years ago I worked a retail job for a large American housewares retailer that is privately owned.  They're a coporation, but they don't have shareholders.  The company's commitment, therefore, was to its workers -- not the general, faceless and nameless population who owned stocks in the company.  As workers in this privately-held company, we received base wages that were 200+% of minimum wage, PLUS we recevied a commission on each day's sales.  My base wage at the time was about $11.50 per hour, but with commission, my hourly wage usually worked out to be about $14.50 per hour and close to $20 per hour at Christmas.  On the other hand, in the intervening years I moved and about 4 years ago, I took a 2nd part-time job at a large corporate retail bookseller whose name everyone in America would recognize.  This company is publicly-held -- they have stockholders.  My starting wage then, even WITH all my years of retail experience, was $6.50 per hour.  No commission.  The company is less concerned with the needs of its employees than it is with turning the biggest profit possible, with the biggest return on investment for the nameless, faceless shareholders.

There should be strict limits on things like welfare and food stamps.  I don't think the gov. should have to provide health insurance, or make employers provide it...the reason health insurance cost so much anyways is because americans started going to the damn doctor for every runny nose and sniffle...and the fact that everything is a syndrome or disorder....people love going to the doc and insurance complanies pay for it...so of course they are going to charge more.  <br>  <br>  The US constitution says you have the rights to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness....that means you should have a chance to earn it, not have it given to you.

People are getting to the point they want everything taken care of for them, and are not willing to work for what they want.  IF you are still one of those people who work for what you have Great...for the rest...stand up on your own two feet...bust you ***, and work for what you want...don't expect the Gov. to do it for you.  <br>  <br>  I do beleive that most of the rich are where they are because someone in their family made the right moves, and the rest of the family stays that way because the continue to make the right moves.

Then they can work for saving up money to help buy a house. Then they can work towards making payments on that house and car since they have a job where they work. Also they can work and if they are a good enough employee maybe their employer will help pay their medical insurance-and if not then well Americans should know how to adjust their budget to buy their own medical insurance. <br>  In other words i feel working is the key to obtain all of those things, but that is against the Obama plan.

The primary reason is to protect the citizens against the federal government. In the time frame the framers wrote about forming our government, a militia was not a tool of the government. It was not a standing army.<br>  <br>  These people who support gun control forget one important fact...<br>  <br>  If the government can ignore one right, it can ignore another.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the bill of rights should not be understood to limit rights, it guarantees certain rights they were concerned might be other wise infringed.<br>  <br>  It may perhaps be more important to understand that: that no document the founders authored exists to be viewed as the limit of individual rights, but rather the limit of governmental influence.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	I believe that's not a great argument.<br>  <br>  The biggest issue with the so-called "assault" gun ban is that it has no effect whatsoever on crime. And the "assault" guns it bans are simply guns that are otherwise still available, as long as they don't have too many military-style features, like large capacity clips, pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, etc.<br>  <br>  So, even under the old ban, you could still get a semi-auto gun, just without all the cool features.<br>  <br>  And, let's face it, crime statistics show that such a ban would affect less than 1% of all gun crimes.<br>  <br>  It's all political theater, a dog & pony show.|`|3caq6SFxaa	I have no problem with people being required to be registered if they own an assault rifle and they are required to do that right now and have been since the 1930's.  An assault rifle by definition has to be capable of automatic (more then one bullet per trigger pull) as well as semi automatic (one round per trigger pull) and that makes it a Class three weapon just like a sub machine gun and so is covered by that law; yes people can and do legally own true assault rifles, machineguns and submchine guns and have always been allowed too; in fact prior to the first federal gun control laws in the 1930's no registration and could be bought any where or even ordered through the mail.  For politicians to redefine "assault rifle" to mean anything that looks like an assault rifle or as in the case of HR45 to define it as any semi automatic weapon with  a detachable clip capable of holding more then 12 rounds or being capable of being modified to use a clip over 12 rounds is a totally different matter.  Any weapon with a detachable magazine is capable of being modified to use a larger magazine-just cut and weld two seven shot magazines together and you have a 13 round magazine (Colt 1911 7 shot pistols were used in WW1 by pilots with a very long 20 round magazine in them so they are "capable of being modified") so every semi-automatic detachable clip weapon will be defined as an "Assault rifle" under this bill including pistols and shotguns.  The definition of assault rifle used by the military to to identify the difference between it and a "main battle rifle" hinges on two things-fires less then a full power military cartidge (7.62x51 NATO in the M-14 was full power but the 5.56mm is classed as less then in power) and be capable of automatic fire.  The M-16 does both and is an assault rifle-the AR-15 civilian version is not automatic and is not an assault rifle.  My Ruger 10/22 is not an assault rifle, my 22 Beratta pistol is not an assault rifle, and my 7.62x51 L1A1 clone is not an assault rifle but all are defined as such under that bill.  The truth is using the accepted military (and the assault rifle is a military term so you use the standard military definition) definition all assault rifles already are federally licensed and registration fees paid as Class 3 weapons; redefining it to expand to basically every semi-automatic rifle, shotgun and pistol made that takes a detachable clip is not anything to do with it being as "assault rifle" and more about using the term to scare people.  More people have been killed with knives then with semi-automatic rifles in the US so if it really a crime thing we should register knives first.  Some gun owners here are saying they see no problem with an law to regulate assault weapons but what they are using is the correct/proper definition of an assault rifle and not the definition being as set in HR45.  The well regulated militia line in the second amendment has now had three Supreme Court rulings saying it uses the old definition of militia (current at the time the Constitution was written) that says every male between the ages of 16 to 65 and actually excluded members of the federal forces as being part of the militia.  Since the latest has been quoted above from the Washington DC gun law that was strck down no one should be arguing that the term only applies to military, NG, police and so on-the Supreme Court said very specifically again that it was an individual right and not one restricted to those groups just listed.  1870's Georgia passed a law saying no one outside of the militia could own a gun and the militia was only open to white people-struck down by the Supreme Court based on the 2nd Amendment not because of the racism but because the 2d Amendment is an individual right and not a collective right, 1930's same thing again.|`|86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	I hope that people who keep on talking about a "right wing revolution" are just kidding, and are not suggesting that they intend to use their guns against your own government officials.

He could be a citizen ONLY if his mother renounced his US citizenship AND his step father adopted him and/or acknowledged him.  Then - DUAL citizenship WAS NOT allowed.  THAT would have renounced his US citizenship EVEN id he was born in Hawaii.  He would have had to come back and taken an oath of allegiance when 18 - which there is no record of OR he may have just slipped through since he was a child - leaving him an illegal alien.  The fact that he could not have dual citizenship in indonesia to go to school is what factors in on this.  He HAD to be a citizen and he DID go to school there.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Can I add that there is a huge difference in beign a "Natural Born Citizen" and a "Naturalized Citizen"  just as there is a difference in a "Birth Certificate" and a "Certificate of Live Birth"<br>  <br>  President MUST be a NATURAL Born citizen.

Obama used his step fathers last name but he was not adopted by him which is why he does not use it now.  I know the official story is that he was sent back here because they didn't think he was getting the best education over there but it was good enough for his sister so why not him?  When you renounce your citizenship, you have to turn over your passport.  Because of that, he would not have been able to easily get back into this country to live with his grandparents if he didn't have US citizenship and passport.  There is no evidence that he ever had an indonesian passport.  I think they lied to the Indonesian government, got caught out and had to send him back because they couldn't afford private school.

The uneducated and ignorant will continue to believe what they wish to believe.  Providing information at this point in time is an exercise in futility.|`|xzwZA3Suaa	Not whoey much|`|S4OHLtnOaa	There are all kinds of sites on the web to verify facts.  the best one I know of is snopes.com<br>  <br>  You can pretty quickly see if something is a fact or not.  Thank God we have the Web today to check things out.  But just like print media or TV, you have to do some checking, don't just drink the coolaide the media gives you.  The web is a great way to check and see if something is a lie or not.  because you don't have to take one bloggers opinion about it.  If more people would go to the web to check out the Main Stream Media, those agents of change who call themselves Journalists would not be able to pull the wool over the sheeps eys so much.<br>  <br>  Also it is important to note.  When in court you take an oath, "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."<br>  <br>  A journalist has taken no oath and they are not bound by any laws other than libel and slander laws about reporting truth.  The Main Stream Media, big news companies across the nation in TV and print, routinly only tell half the story.  This is where the news consumer has to watch out because a half truth can have the same effect as a Lie.<br>  <br>  hypathetical case in point.  Joe Biden said in the debate, John McCain has voted for tax increases over 200 some odd times. Insinuating, that is more than Obama has ever voted for tax increases.  problem being that that statement is not the whole truth and therefore becomes a lie in the minds of the people who don't have the time to check out what Joe said.  McCain has been a senator for 22 years, Obama for 2 years.  the fair comparison would be what percentage of the time does McCain vote for tax increases.  For Obama I believe the percentage is close to 100% for McCain it can't be more than 50% or 60%  I am sure and I would hope it is much lower than that.  For a conservative I am not saying McCain has a perfect record of oposing tax increases but Obama does have a nearly perfect record of going the wrong way on Tax issues.|`|yFG0NhD4aa	  Just consider the source when you view it.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.  If it sounds too fake to be true, it usually is.  So many people will blow up some tiny event and make it into a giant false disaster.  <br>    Certain websites are like the trash grocery store magazines you see that headline "Republicans give birth to Democratic alien" or "Jesus sent man sign, Jesus will be on the ballot this year, riding down from heaven on an elephant."  Ya know, that crap?<br>    I only respond to comments that I think are funny.  I also only read like CNN, or MSN, reputable sources (like my mom!).|`|YYLtqZqnaa	You have to cross-check the information, consider your sources and use your best judgement.

pdvqX3R6aa	so says the bible|`|IxaDmj3xaa	Marriage is a legal union between two people, which then gives certain legal rights to those people.  You can get married at a courthouse, a chapel in Vegas etc.  It does not have anything to do with god.  I think all people should have the same legal rights.  I also support a church's right not to perform a religious ceremony if they don't feel it fits within their teachings.    |`|oRMEtsJwaa	Yes I believe it is witnessed by God, but that isn't the main reason I voted yes on prop 8. I voted yes because if you actually read the darn thing it keeps the rights of the priests and churches that don't believe i gay marriage from being sued. It also keeps ANY talk about marriage whether traditional or same sex out of the schools. Whether same sex marriage is ok or not is not a fact and should not be taught to children. I believe same sex relations is a sexual sin just as much a sex before marriage is. This however didn't influence my vote, my vote is based on the judicial implications of not passing the prop. Just as everyone is up in arms about the rights of gays, the rights of churches (Christian, Muslim, and Jewish all have it written in their religious books). They should not be forced to do anything they believe hurt themselves. Also prop 8 doesn't take away any domestic partnership rights for gay couples. Also with the supreme courts ruling standing the gay community is classified as a "protected class" which means they will have preference in court decisions that have nothing to do with them being gay. <br>  <br>  |`|SpBAcRJmaa	Marriage is seen diferantly by all relegions, In this country and as a legal issue, a marriage shoud be a partnership between 2 people, if you do not think 2 guys should be married and do not consider them married, fine, but as a legal matter they should have the same rights as any other 2 adults that hook up.|`|fA0JLVAIaa	i think marriage that is recognized by the government should be between any 2 adults that want to get married. Everyone should have to get married by a state recognized court and then they can what whatever religious wedding ceremony they choose. Religion and state should be separate.|`|9lQsCa3Faa	Yes I do, but I don't believe God hates gay people just because somebody wrote that he did in Leviticus.|`|169hr6bzaa	No...You can't help who you love & God knows that!|`|coBISjDfaa	Definitely not. |`|NLoYBbtuaa	IF it was a union blessed by god, how would atheist get married?|`|AA10508025	yes marriage ie blessed by god..|`|AA11556971	Yes it should and I approve this message|`|761dtewpaa	god isnt real so ,no.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	If not only between man and woman, and if it is between any two why not any 4 or 6, since the reasoning for any two is the same as the reasoning for larger numbers, but then in the affairs of the heart, logic is out the window.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	No, but that's fine if you believe that.  Marriage is a civil action in terms of the legality.  What blessings you receive within your church is your business, a non-legislative matter.  All consenting adults should be free to marry whomever they choose.  Even convicted felons can marry, for heaven's sake.  And if your church doesn't want to marry same-sex couples, that's fine.  Nobody's going to force them to.  This a civil matter, not a religious one.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	no i'm not religious<br>  and i'm not a jerk, so i support equal rights for everyone reguardless of sexual orientation.  people who disagree are assholes.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	No. It is a legal relationship sanctioned by the state, and thus should be open to any adult citizens to marry the consenting adult partner of their choice.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	No... I think it's a spiritual union between two people committed to each other through both the good and bad times in life.|`|QUPSol2uaa	This section is elections....perhaps you best pop over to the Family & Relationships section eh?|`|Rc43gfbGaa	If it is performed in a church, sure. How can you make that pronouncement about people who get married in city hall? Let the churches make their rules and the states make theirs, that's what our constitution says. If you don't like that you can always live in a place like Saudi Arabia. Why can't you people just let two people that love each other be happy together?|`|AA11409272	I'm not a religious person...so marriage should be the domain of the church, and I will respect their decision.<br>  The government should only grant a legal partnership to any two adults that want it|`|eY0MhGfmaa	Yes. God ordained marriage at the beginning of the human race.|`|T7WlMHrZaa	Sounds like that is a judgment for God, in other words that's above my pay grade. <br>  <br>  <br>  Obama Biden 2008-2016|`|AA11711276	Hardly; marriage existed long before the Judeo-Christian god was even invented.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	Nah, I think everyone should have the opportunity to be equally miserable. :)|`|eX7An0AKaa	No. It should be between any two people who love each other.|`|BpT0t1qMaa	Yes and Yes.

Simple Econ 101 it decreases in value!!  Soo  Socialism is a good thing right?|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I was not impressed with the GOP for pulling this stunt off. They can do A LOT better than that.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	what did you expect from a party that thinks Palin is smart?<br>  <br>  by the way<br>  <br>  if she is such a dymamic upcoming Republican why didn't she give the rebuttal?|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Yeah ok... <br>  <br>  1) the majority of Americans barely have an 8th grade education so please realize the audience. And I am pretty sure that Obama sounded Amaturish too when he first started speaking at the beginning of his run for Presiden... not that Gov. Jindal is officially running yet as he has not said as much, but he is one of the louder Republican Gov. against the Stimulus bill, so it makes sense why GOP leaders would want him to speak instead of someone else.<br>  <br>  2) Republicans were not in State office at that time and I have heard many other stories... Such as the Louisiana Dept. of Homeland Security (which was run by a Dem at that time) would not allow the Red Cross in. and I know for a fact (hearing it from my dad that was in the Air Force at the time) that the National Guard was standing by waiting for the word from the President, who had to wait for the word from the Governor (Who was a Dem at the time) to go in and help the people in New Orleans... <br>  <br>  3) Have you even just read the transcript? Because in my opinion it definitely reads better...|`|YupMCYHlaa	I agree.  Even the Testicles guy agrees!<br>  <br>  But I have seen Jindal in informal interview situations and he comes off much better.  They really tore him a new one last night on The Daily Show, but just a couple of weeks ago he was interviewed on Daily Show and he looked really good!  He was comfortable, good sense of humor, good thinking on his feet.<br>  <br>  It wasn't Jindal that looked so bad in that response to Obama's speech, it was the text.  The same old Republican line that Americans are getting tired of.  Jindal wasn't telling us what he thought himself, he was being a spokesman for the standard Republican Agenda.  I wondered how he could keep a straight face!|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	He's the best they have to offer - can't wait for 2012!|`|xUQDTEbZaa	I can't watch it anymore. It was just too creepy|`|G350VVknaa	Jindal's ability to speak convincingly to the American people should not be compared to Bush or Obama.  The content of the speech was, in my opinion, very immature and self-serving.  We already know how the "Katrina Episode" went down and where to place the blame for that!  If you Republicans hope to be a real challenge in 2012, you should keep looking for a new leader because Jindal and Limbaugh won't make it!|`|ED433Q6Yaa	it s not more childish than "yes we can". and really, obama is a very good speaker so anyone who followed him was going to sound second rate.  did you address the substance of jindals speech or like with palin, worry about his hair, his voice, his hunting skills or did he make any valid points? and while reps were in charge in washington during katrina, the state has the accountability for the first 72 hours.  and i believe it was a dem mayor and gov running the show.hmmmmm|`|TBYEQi64aa	Bobby Jindal is a conservative.

At the end of the year you will not have as much to claim for withholdings.  BUt with the cap and trade your cost of living will increase.|`|AyeYeS2baa	i spent my stimulus last year on a 32 inch TV<br>  I stimulated the economy<br>  people who paid bills and hid the money in a shoebox are why we aren't getting the lump sum this year.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	They get extended unemployment IF they are collecting it. <br>  <br>  Some of us who got laid off, chose not to take the handout|`|wbIEau0qaa	theres no free handouts... its a tax break|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	Don't worry ... be happy, just drink a little more of the Kool Aid.<br>  <br>  The "tax break" equates out to about $8 to $13 a week depending on your income level.  So go wild and have a cheeseburger ... it's on me.  <br>  <br>  The extended unemployment benefits that are so upsetting to South Carolina, Louisiana, and Mississippi are the stipulations that come with the increase in federal support over the next 3 years.  The states will get money from the fed until 2011, but have to extend unemployment benefits to part-time labor.  Plus, after that 3-year term expires, those benefits must be maintained despite the fact that the federal spigot turns off.  This means higher unemployment taxes for business, which means less money to pay hired employees (now affecting part-time employees as well), and a resulting smaller workforce.|`|BI1BciOFaa	Either way the whole "stimulus package" sounds like a scam, and please don't label me as a Republican or Democrat because politics absolutey stinks....

Other than that, the cost isn't much. <br>  <br>  I don't know if the vendors have to pay to set up a booth, but money would definitely come from that.

Acorn lobbied Fannie and Freddie (government institutions) to back these risky loans.<br>  <br>  It is not all acorn, but forcing risky loans on these banks was wrong.<br>  <br>  Actually the staw that broke the camels back was and remains the price of gas.  When gas rose to over $2.00 a gallon and upwards of  $4.00 a gallon, people stopped spending, it was all they could do to put food on the table, feed, cloth, and pay monthly bills, because it was all going towards gas.  They could not afford to pay their bills and have gotten behind.  but it only takes a few bad loans going to people who cannot pay them to ruin a bank.  These people were getting loans for homes ranging from $150,000 and up, knowing that they could not afford the $900 - 1500 dollar a month mortgage payment.  If these people signed up for a variable mortgage rate, adn that was what many banks were doing, well those monthly payments start low, and then when time has come for their first increase, those rates doubled, so what was 900.00 a month is now 1800.00 a month.  The bullying tactics of ACORN on the banks forcing them to give loans to people who could not afford to pay them back, has not helped matters in anyway shape or form.<br>  <br>  I do not blame the poor for everything, I do however believe that you create and are responsible for your own success.  If you want to be successful, then you have to work for it, it is not given to you.  You control your future, your success, it is up to you and you alone, you have to want to be better than a free handout.  I don't mind helping, but I do mind being taken advantage of, when every person of every color can achieve anything they want to be it you want it bad enough.  If not then you are just become a slave of the welfare system, and you are dependant on the govt. for everything.  My Dr. is a black man, he worked and worked hard to get to where he is, it was not handed to him, nor is it being handed to his son who is also looking to go into the medical field.

That is the role of the national government. It isn't to provide for those who are unable or unwilling to provide for self, although I agree with aiding those unable to provide for self if the states are unable or unwilling to do so.<br>  <br>  It really is about what you want your tax dollars working for - and how much you want to be taxed no matter what you do for a living, where you do it, or how you do it. This is where Obama shows prejudice.<br>  <br>  Seriously - think about this for a moment. Isn't there competition between major colleges? Don't they compete for the best and brightest of the youth to come and learn at their university? Why can't it be the same way among the states on EVERY issue? Shouldn't it be that way? It should be, and not to make everyone move from one state to another either. It should be that way to present what works best and for the states that can't figure it out to learn from the success of other states. Now apply that also to being an individual and you've got conservative in a nutshell.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  Oh and in defense if Bush? He did get saddled with 9/11, the mortgage crisis, and the stock market crash. He should have sat idly by smoking cigars and reading Huster instead? If that is what democrats think is leadership, I want no part of Obama, or your party, ever.|`|5b17682b999fc3753a335f95a1eb84b9aa	No I was dismayed by the growth of government over the last 8 years. <br>  I also, like we all do, have to realize that the times, they are a changing. <br>  You cannot start at the top with Wall Street greed, since groups like Acorn and Obama's law firm Sued Banks in the Community to force them to give loans to people who shouldn't have qualified. <br>  Toxic is as toxic does. |`|yFG0NhD4aa	... would you check your data & confirm when the dems wanted in the house and when they finally got in, how much of their vote weighed on the changes that happened, and coincidentally, happened for the worst of our government.

So, who changed things then?  Again, check back on your calendar to when the dems got in, and when things changed... <br>  <br>    Oh, and as  republican, I stand for guns, my private space, and the comfort of knowing God fearing Christians are a majority taking care of our country and keeping one man one woman marriages, and keeping a babies life... the rest is just politics, it doesn't matter who's our president, black/white rep/dem, we will still have the money problems for our country.|`|QjBZxjcWaa	Ask to the prime minister of Israel.<br>  |`|FhKfyxWlaa	Republicans didn't do it alone.

s1LfdCdsaa	The road to Hell is paved with false hope. Having said that, true to form, the Conservative pundits were correct. With an impending deficit quoted in the trillions, we should have a National Referendum calling for Obama and Biden to step down. It does not have to be as humiliating as formal impeachment proceedings, but it is beyond clear that we need an ultra-Conservative team to step in and take control.<br>  <br>  I would also call upon Senator McCain to encourage individuals like Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan to step to the helm, as people like these can steer us back towards the Reagan days.<br>  <br>  Right now, it's NO WE CAN'T, and OH NO WE DIDN'T!!<br>  <br>  For it to be YES WE CAN, we need to collectively call upon CONSERVATIVES for a political bail out.<br>  <br>  The sooner the better!!|`|MS0WHTUnaa	Because just like he couldn't do a thing about Illinois murders,liars,crooks and cheats.

pVdV4gwgaa	No. I am voting for Obama. And he just isn't black he is multi-racial. And he can and will get the job done.|`|ZjSgawcpaa	No, I'm voting for him because he's intelligent and a very good and strong leader.|`|H3t86K8Baa	Yes.<br>  America must be represented by the right type<br>  <br>  Also his liberal ideas such as giving driver licenses do illegal immigrants is just apalling|`|B3H034Vtaa	He is not African American.

My concern is he came out of nowhere with no history as to where he really stands.  His short stint in the Congress has provided only more questions.  His past associations have created many concerns.  This election should not be about black or white.  It is about choosing the right person to lead our country.  Obama seems to say the right things.  Knowing nothing about the real man, how can anyone be sure of his character and true intentions.  Anyone can speak words.  Carrying them out is another story.  <br>  <br>  Voting for someone just because of their color or gender is just as bad as voting against someone for the same reasons.  This is just too important a decision.  Once this decision is cast, we may not get a chance to take it back.  Personally, I don't think either candidate has a real clue.  How one does will depend on who they surround themselves with and we won't know that until after the election. |`|yFG0NhD4aa	actually, he is bi-racial... and if he was purple, I still wouldn't vote for him.  I want someone we can trust a little better.  Plus, I was raised Republican, that seems to be the way.

I agree more with the Republican party but if McCain was Arabic or black or whatever I would vote for him because of the fundamentals of his campaign.  |`|3OFxasXHaa	that's a contributing factor, but more importantly, he isn't the right candidate.  it's unfortunate he will get votes simply because he is black|`|MuftlcVJaa	I'm not voting for him b/c of his Marxist ideology.|`|4GQrTt2Naa	No... not because of his race, but because he's better than McCain?
VlnxVZSNaa	No, not completely crazy. He's a man that has always had what he wants when he wants it and has never been denied anything. He has never ran a business for a single day yet he's THE financial guru, please. We all know he's just a puppet and his buddies (Pelosi, Biden, Schumacher, Soros, Gore, the list goes on & on & on.. just follow the money trail) are the ones pulling the strings, feeding him the speeches and proposing "His" stimulus plan.<br>  <br>  As if it's not completely obvious that all the major media outlets are also controlled by the same socialist movement, they've only RECENTLY just figured out how transparent they are and are starting to "question Obama" as if they have no affiliation whatsoever (a little too late for that smoke screen). How did you like the CBS commercial they started running after the election and they're still running today "CBS - YES WE CAN". Pretty much sums it up, doesn't it?? Government controlling what's said over the media, why YES WE CAN". It's surely change we all can believe in.<br>  <br>  <br>  A quote from a president that Obama respectfully admires.<br>  <br>  "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." - Abraham Lincoln|`|ASsGxJ9maa	some body has to do something and people are acting as if this is unheard of no one had a problem when bush did it. all i can do is wait and see. all these job cuts and company closing its not his fault he just got there people are so mad that he there that they cant see that hes only been there for a month this has been going on for years look it up and see that these banks have been in trouble for years that's why they were all merging before it only recently that the shi% has hit the fan. so many new people are able to have health care and that's what matters i don't care about the banks at all. but i thinks he making a conscious effort unlike bush who was just listening to his pimps|`|PHU0lOl3aa	Obama seems to think that spending  more money you do not have is the way to get out of debt.

Congress has gone crazy too. Remember Obama only proposes the budget. Congress gets to alter it before it sends it back to Obama for his signature.<br>  <br>  Democrats hammered Republicans for being fiscally irresponsible. Yet in the last few months, starting before Obama even was elected they authorized the TARP for $700 billion. and right after he was sworn in there was the "stimulus" package to the tune of $787B. That's an increase of almost $1.5 TRILLION added to the national debt. Bush with all his spending never came close to jacking the national debt that far that fast. <br>  <br>  Do you realize if that keeps up the national debt will have doubled in less than two years.<br>  <br>  Obama in his speech said he 'inherited' a trillion dollar deficit. But that he would cut that deficit by 50% in four years. Now I wish that some intelligent liberal could explain to this ol' country boy how Uncle Sam is going to cut the deficit by 50% when he doesn't stop spending?<br>  <br>  My Uncle Charlie had a drinking problem. Folks told Uncle Charlie if he didn't stop drinking it would kill him. Uncle Charlie didn't stop, in fact he drank more. Maybe he did that just to prove them wrong. Guess what? They weren't wrong and Uncle Charlie drank himself to death.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	This isnt like the TARP money (which was released willy-nilly by the Bushies & Cronies) it has specific strings attached and functions as an investment with returns.<br>  <br>  So when the banks turn around we get our $$ back.

GJJw2wszaa	The most famous of  inventors, scientist and creative people have been at some level mostly left wingers. Talents seems to reflect their ideals in their work or purpose there off.  People in the Fine Arts, Hollywood, Game Industry and Scientist  to mention a few have a different out look on life and are by nature moved to push the envelope, this is not a conservative trade and is not motivated by capital interest. Creative people and innovators are by nature nonconformist. Capitalism fuels investors to invest but it is the unorthodox thinkers who create new products, They are the once who create the vision. The air craft before it was invented was first visioned by Leonardo Da Vinci,   most discoveries and innovation for the use electricity and the discovery of wireless communication were achieve by Nicolas Tesla to mention a few. Capitalist are move by capitalist gains, like bankers, business man, sales man etc.. Socialist are moved by innovation of society. <br>  <br>  And artist who himself is capitalist will only create what and when he sales. And artist who is socialist its reward first and foremost by his creation and then and only then by profits.  <br>  <br>  Innovators are addicted to and motivated by their craft  not by out side rewards. Profit is the cherry on top, nice to have but not as important as social recognition and contribution.<br>  <br>  <br>   Einstein was himself socialist and this is a paper he wrote:

AA11461754	my friend is in the process of being a cop right now.... First you have to take a test (i forget what its called, but there are only a few days in a year in which u can take it, so if i were u I would do some research!).<br>  <br>  You need to score high, in order to continue.  Former Marines, SWAT, SEALS, and just normal people take this test, so it can get REALLY competitive.  After the test, they do LOTS of background checks on you.  THey will literally call just about everyone u know.  And then there is a physical test, that you also MUST pass.  <br>  <br>  Right now my friend is past all that, hes just waiting.  He said something about starting off with over a 100 people, now theres about 8 left.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	You must first sell your soul to the devil since that is who you are actually going to be working for!|`|qwaWd14vaa	Use to be Fingerprints, firearms and blood stains.<br>  Now this is divided into 9 distinct groups.<br>  See wikipedia- Scientific Working Groups
11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Contact the Better Business Bureau or Health Commissioner.  I had the exact same problem when our State had Coventry Health Insurance.  They finally dropped them.  Insurance companies can be crooked.  |`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	Escalate your call at the insurance company.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, file a complaint with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner or Attorney General (use it as a threat with Customer Service).<br>  <br>  Also remember that certain activities are NOT covered.|`|8AksxQF4aa	who is your plan with please?|`|AA11209233	Yes, you need to talk to a lawyer.  It still takes time--a lot of it.  But at least they'll know that you aren't just going to go away and forget about it.  |`|0JL3Mg78aa	Check with the Federal Trade Commission to see if there are other complaints, and file your own.  The feds will investigate if there are enough complaints.  There are many unscrupulous insurance companies (if they are even in insurance).  
Yzcptoagaa	The posters above are wrong.  It doesn't matter where the contract "happened."  That might mean that Hawaiian law applies to the contract, but it doesn't affect jurisdiction over the defendant.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Hawaii courts have no personal jurisdiction over a non-resident who has moved away.<br>  <br>  If the contract doesn't say that he consents to personal jurisdiction in Hawaii, then you'd have to go to Missouri (or wherever he resides) and sue him in small claims court there.<br>  <br>  Or you could wait until he actually sets foot in Hawaii again, and then serve him with a summons when he's there.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I know that's not what you want to hear.<br>  <br>  Update:  I saw your note.  I don't think a court would consider that good enough to waive personal jurisdiction.  It says he'll pay, but not that he agrees he can be sued in Hawaii.  You could give it a shot, but even if you win, how will you collect?  You'd have to take your Hawaii judgment to a court in Missouri, open a new action, and have the Missouri court enforce it.|`|AA10123414	You would file the case in Hawaii as the contract happened there.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	You would have to file a complaint or a writ of summons (which will result in you eventually having to file a complaint) in the county where the event took place with the county prothonotary.  Then when the prothonotary registers the complaint, you take it to the county sheriff and ask him or her to make service upon the individual you are suing.  I'm sure the sheriff can inform you of how to make service upon the individual if he cannot do it for you.
XoAwzQ5Yaa	Request a copy of their criminal record. I've run many people (in my line of work), some have been arrested over 600 times, so its not unusual for someone to lose track.|`|XLSfTnISaa	Get a background check via NCIC.<br>  <br>  If you have to question how many times you have been arrested, my guess is its too many.|`|b8svqAMAaa	If it isnt you then I wouldnt be hanging out with the person you are typing about.  sounds like a trouble maker.|`|Qg2X1XzDaa	count?|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	How can anyone not know how many arrests they have had?<br>  <br>  If someone has been arrested so often that they can't keep count then the answer is they have had too many.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Why?<br>  Do you doubt the truth about what he is saying?<br>  If he has had more then 3 felonies, he would be in Prison or Jail.<br>  If he has had more then 10 misdemeanors, probably in Jail maybe prison.<br>  The only way to find out is to ask someone you know to run a check on the person.<br>  If your county has a web site, sometimes they have all arrest records from the court on line.
yFG0NhD4aa	they are taking their sweet time to dig our hole a little deeper than it already is, then they can suck even more money out of us to make it seem like it is needed... as if sucking the blood out of us this far hasn't killed us enough...<br>  We checked our 401K and other investments last night...I'm beginning to wonder if we should stop while we are ahead and take that coffee can, fill it with what's left of our 401K and bury it in the garden!!!  The government will probably take their heli, heat sensor my garden and take that too!|`|9hYA9Zbkaa	Dems like pork, " Squeel like a pig, Ooooweee Oooowee ".|`|jMXVBCwGaa	How do you ad pork to a bill that is all pork in the first place?|`|DjfJTNebaa	as much as they can get away with|`|SI9cUGrKaa	ask the pigs.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	I hope that's  ultimately why democrats and republicans voted it down yesterday. If liberals have anything to do with it though it will be packed full of trash.|`|bkav003oaa	Oh yeh that is the real reason it will pass - another bridge to nowhere anyone?
VElNUno7aa	McCain hands down.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	McCain & Palin.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	im voting yes for barack obama, its time for a change and not the same "john mccain" who voted for most of the things bush voted for which is  pretty much the same, that is why the economy is in the state its in today, if you want change then vote barack obama today =) <br>  <br>  bush screwed it up and mccain will finish the job.. so if anyone has half a brain in there head the obvious choice would be obama, and yes im white voting for him and i have above average intelligence.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Neither is worthy of the presidency of this great nation , but since you asked , I will tell you that I am voting for the lesser of two evils , John McCain . At least he is not confused about his being an American and knows what his heritage is . Obama can not even spell foreign relations unless his allegience lies with the Muslim nation as he said in his book .|`|ayhDyb16aa	McCain-----Im not wasting my vote on a socialist.  -------------PS socialist means someone who just loves to spend other peoples money.|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	Barack Obama.  Landslide.  |`|htxwTAAQaa	Obama.  Nov 4th|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	I would never consider voting for someone who would sink this economy into the ground, destroy our health care system, make no real effort to reform education or further deteriorate our rights. That is why I would never vote McCain, so I choose Barack Obama. |`|ODf41iN4aa	Obama.  |`|47l1Sumeaa	Barack Obama! |`|4gqKkpLraa	BARACK OBAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wSMYGzrQaa	Barack Obama|`|hz2nFhVEaa	already voted Obama|`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	I voted early, OBAMA!|`|dJBaPWhkaa	McCain all the way|`|OFNRwa8Maa	I say by everyone who has answered your question Obama has it won hands down!  if the republicans win you know the race has been fixed!  most true Americans are scared to death of john mcbush!  and even more scared that palin (don't ya know) stupid woman (I'm a woman and she makes us look bad) that she is will take over cause McCain is too damned old! for Christ sake he looks as if he's days away from dieing (if you've ever seen him in person you know what i mean) |`|LIty5lAEaa	well i didnt make the deadline to register but i would vote for whichever one was the white guy everyone i know is and i hope he wins office next month<br>  <br>  edit: oh yeah thumbs down because i want the white guy to win rofl this is why nothing.|`|c3316a5f71249d75a984bd40fa3e4358aa	Neither I dont vote in your country. Aren't there any chat rooms on the internet for your to discuss American politics. I am dying to answer an intelligent question.|`|3iZJ4o2maa	John McCain.<br>  <br>  if you want to vote for barrack obama than do america a favor and dont vote at all!! <br>  <br>  |`|zidt1H2Faa	If I could vote...Obama.

3LuejgR6aa	Good points - Agreed|`|qAUcN7GXaa	Did you forget that Obama admittedly took cocaine and smoked marijuana. I guess prescribed pain medicine addiction is worse than illegal drug consumption. You also have no right to speculate on whether or not McCain was actually tortured. |`|9oKmNTFDaa	Agree|`|ZZe49myZaa	Don't leave out Keating, McCain took money from him to make sure there was no regulation of his company, he also attended the meetings with the regulator to intimidate him into no providing regulations, McCain was very involved with Keating as a friend and in business.Then there is G Gordon Liddy. McCains good friend who went to prison for his role in Watergate and who was involved in a murder and encouraged the shooting of federal Marshals. McCain has also taken huge amounts of money from  Big Oil and Big Business to push their causes, He has basically sold his soul to them and will not  support environmental issues or regulations and oversight. McCain claims to be against Lobbyists but has hired many to run his campaign including Timmons who is currently involved in a scandal due to lobbying for Saddam Hussein and taking very large amounts of money for this. McCain has been involved with convicted criminals, while they are engaging in criminal activities, yet Obama gets condemned for working with a college professor/education reformer who committed acts 40 years ago. Obama is an ethical, moral man and McCain is a whore dog crook.|`|PCbfSSjmaa	They are politicians! They have NO morals. However, I would say that Senator McCain seems like the more honest out of the two. I don't trust a person who can hang around with racist preachers, former domestic terrorists, and shady businessmen and then deny or downplay the relationships that they had together. |`|2S0vRzVvaa	Both have values, but different ones.<br>  I agree more with those of Obama, but some of the points you make are irrelevant for the question who would be a better president.|`|98c8aae2548fff8672a524536f749ae9aa	I disagree with some of your point but i am voting for Obama because i think he has the capability to help the American economy|`|FXAoIqcfaa	I dont give 2 damn cents about what religion a candidate is. Religion should not have a factor at all in deciding who to elect. |`|794889483dab5bb7fa527e9186f8e87caa	McCain by far|`|UbXVjcm7aa	While I agree with most of the points you've made here and I too, am a supporter of Obama I think your slightly out of line with some of the remarks you've made. John McCain is a war hero I'm not trying to deny that and the fact that he chose not to go when given the opportunity as a POW bc technically it wasn't his turn to go is commendable. Although, I don't personally see how his military experience from all those years ago makes him a better choice for president today. I will be voting for Obama on Nov. 4th bc I truly from the bottom of my heart believe he is the right choice for our country at this time.|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	I think it depends on what you look at and what you value.  First of all, Obama, what to the Gov to be in control of everything.  People don't like McCain because, god forbid, a person having to take some accountablity for the choices they make.  Second, like this war or not, agree with the reason we started it or not, the fact is we are there, and we have to FINISH it.  Now, as far as the POW thing...don't even go there....even the people who were "given special treatment" had to go through things that would kill most of us.  and until you have spent time there, don't even go there.  I personally know people who were in POW camps, and heard what people went through.  And until you have been a soldier, don't question why an officer would choose to stay with the men they have suffered with.  You obviously have no idea or respect for what those men went through.<br>  <br>  The problem with Obama is that he was the government to take care of the people, not the people to take care of themselves.  |`|gi0teoYsaa	But Obama had a cocain addiction and he provided money to the univesity that employed his wife, garnering a $200,000 a year raise.  And what charity has been the recipient of Obama money?  I didn't know that being a tortured prisoner of war made you a bad person.  Considering that most liberals oppose any punishment for convicted criminals I would think McCain is an awesome choice for left wingers.  And they are both worth millions so net value is the same.|`|Jnid7CKCaa	Your argument has left out a few inconvenient truths. Obama is supportive of partial birth abortions as well as other late term pregnancy terminations and has said he doesn't want youngsters "punished" w a baby. I am pro-choice but I find these views extreme. And I feel that a failed marriage doesn't dismiss someone as having no values. <br>  <br>  Politicians have to lie (nature of the beast) so I wouldn't take much stock in either of the candidates' promises. |`|Ql9cORmgaa	Morally, Obama has it hands down. John also cheated on Carol with Cindy and left his wife and 4 children for her after her accident. I can't believe that Obama has enough restraint to not bring that up with all the Ayers crap. <br>  <br>  On a side note, I will not take anything away for John McCain for what he did or did not do as a POW. God bless him for his service to our country. I don't think it is fair to question whether a man was "truly tortured" after he was held for 5 years. He was not in the Marriott. I do not like McCains policies or his choice in VP selection, but I will never begrudge him his due respect for his service. |`|d03d1f6a713407f3a6dbe8c90e096997aa	As the grandson of the Navy's Admiral, McCain actually recieved preferential treatment.  McCain has repeatedly said that the North Vietnamese offered to let him go, but he refused until all his fellow POWs could leave together.  "I would rather endure 2 more years of tortue than leave my fellow Americans behind."  The truth is the offer of early release was given to most POWs.  They only had to sign a "confession" which could have amounted to a court martial when they returned to the US.  McCain was no Maverick.  He was hiding at the bottom of the pack, and behind his family name, where's he's spent his entire life.<br>  <br>  Obama has real integrity for admitting that he did drugs in college, as opposed to Bill Clinton, who claimed he never inhaled, or George Bush who would only admit to "youthful indescretions.  It shows that Obama has nothin to hide, he is open and forthright about his past.  However with Bush we've had 8 years of government secrecy.  McCain will continue this facist tradition.|`|PVcdO65Oaa	Obama
bmCInR5qaa	OMG!  I'm your neighbor!|`|xUQDTEbZaa	Oh please. If this is true, it happened under Bush because Obama did not raise his taxes yet.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Well tell him to stop buying caviar and Mazzaratis then. Tell all your rich white republican friends.|`|AA10152346	No worries, his taxes will go to help these children and many others.|`|fPMVuB87aa	I feel happy for your neighbor. (sarcasm) <br>  But sad for your grammar.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	You made that up.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	I'm not but with the changes in taxes Obama is discussing we will see a sharp decline in charitable giving as the government will be talking that money and wasting it..<br>  <br>  edit: we need not have tax and spend or borrow and spend, why don't we try responsible spending?..|`|f32fab1eea4e11e137dd528a9ce02f4faa	Yes, they're happy.  The government should be providing everything to the needy, not silly charities.  Besides, when all the charities go away, they won't have to feel like such selfish, stingy losers for not contributing to them.|`|oKoABzNtaa	Given a choice between tax-and-spend and borrow-and-spend fiscal policies, I'll take the former.  I mean really, when was the last truly fiscally conservative administration?  When was the last fiscally conservative administration that wasn't in the back pocket of the Religious Right?|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	There is no problem.<br>  <br>  The government will give his taxes to the foundation for children with cleft lips.<br>  <br>  This way, the foundation would be sure to receive the money.|`|IngripgMaa	The taxes he will be paying will help those very children through Government Programs.  Once the Gov. stops spending money in Iraq, we'll be able to use it for our own people.  So, yes to your silly question!|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Neo con babble.|`|I9FOycm6aa	Tell him to put regular in his Porsche|`|DuDMbnAkaa	HELL NO... he has to live near you.  Poor bastard.|`|SpBAcRJmaa	Here is the deal, if we were properly taxed, there would be no need for a charity to help children with cleft lip. If a kid has a cleft lip, his folks should not have to go begging to a charity if they do not have enough money, the kid should just go to the hospital and have his problem treated, as a right because he is a citizen of a caring country!!!|`|GYJLnvhzaa	well I'm sorry for those kids w/cleft lip, but have you noticed that our economy is complete sh*t right now? Lowering taxes would only worsen things. I know low taxes seem like a good idea but anyone who has ever taken a basic, even highschool, economics course would know this.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Guess he likes paying more taxes then, since giving to charities actually will lower one's tax burden.  The more you give to charity, the less tax you have to pay.|`|55NKPb82aa	I am in the same boat but I just give less than usual.|`|8xlb6subaa	well, he sure isn't you, because you spend far too much time on Yahoo to be rich, so why worry about it?
BLMh0dG6aa	Oh what for the day of Clinton of Lincoln bedroom fees, luchens, and of The Saudi' traveling halfway around the world to do the same with Bush, before and after 9/11|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	Not everyone has a life.|`|SQe5IUgtaa	Wow, sounds like inner city high school.
M3maZgdyaa	In today's economy. The poor man. America is not after his hard earned money. They are after the wealthy with a vengeance. LOL|`|AA10811674	I'd say once your basic human needs of food, shelter, companionship are met, there isn't much difference between rich or modest peoples happiness. . It seems to me it would be pretty mental, some people are pissed no matter what, and some folks are generally happy.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	depends - mostly the poor <br>  <br>  but there is so many reasons for that <br>  <br>  and a poor man is generally very rich <br>  <br>  it is not about money, all the money in the world cannot take the palce of God, Love, family and self esteem|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	You are correct.<br>  <br>  But we now live in a totally materialistic, Utilitarian society.<br>  <br>  Your right to seek your own happiness now is subsumed by the needs of the collective.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Happiness has little to do with how much money you have (which I think is your point).  But that goes both ways, so  I dont know how you can make that assessment|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I was probably happier when I was close to broke. Not that I am rich now but I am compared to then.<br>  <br>  Having money actually creates more things to worry about.|`|htxwTAAQaa	"Anyone catching my point here?"<br>  <br>  Not really, actually.  Your question is all over the place.  A man's happiness has nothing to do with how much money he makes, but the condition of his soul and all that it has experienced.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	A medium man.<br>  <br>  Being poor sucks for the obvious reasons.<br>  <br>  Being too wealthy means you devote all of your time to money, and worrying about it. <br>  <br>  Being medium is just right.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	The man who makes at least $100 more per year than the his "wife's sister's husband."|`|64a0cdc81ae050a15d204e9d78433326aa	Because he has less worries, the poor man is happier till he gets rich, then he gets happier because he becomes rich while the rich man remained the same.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	I would rather be miserable in my beach front house with my BMW in the garage, than miserable in my mother's basement.|`|AA12089018	A poor man is poor for a reason.

Being rich provides more opportunity but happiness comes from within.  There are some rich people that are miserable and some very poor ones that love life.  Happiness doesn't come from things.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	According to Obama, the poor man, as long as we are all equally poor.  He made this decision for us.

PaLJ4pU8aa	The Geneva Conventions prohibit exhibition or humiliation of prisoners of war.  Yet Obama does this.  Tough to explain.  Sad to say, the President of the United States is a creep.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	I always viewed Bush Sr's decision to prevent media access as him hiding one ugly truth about war because those coffins are bad PR. ending it means that we are allowed to see and acknowledge the very high cost of war. Far from disrespectful, it is honoring those that gave everything for their country, hiding their sacrifice is what is disrespectful.|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	I agree with WHIP.  If we are going to use those who sacrificed their lives for us for political reasons let us be truthful and realistic:<br>  <br>  Display the coffins but give as much time to doctors sticking scissors into the heads of newborn babies and sucking out their brains.  Let's show them being thrown in an incinerator or let's show them if they have already drawn a breath thrown into a utilility room until they die of suffication.  Let's see all those compassional doctors who took an oath to do no harm.  Let's see those nurses who treat a baby like an infected appendix.<br>  <br>  Let's show mothers who have paid for this pedicide what they have actually done.  Maybe they will think again before using abortion as birth control.<br>  <br>  Politics is totally is lacking in common sense.  The liberal media does not care about anything but their liberal agenda and  pant after that agenda like a dog in heat.<br>  <br>  I'm ready.  Give me your thumbs down!  The truth sets me free and I thrive on that truth.|`|ob3fUVedaa	I personally don't think you should televise DEAD PEOPLE, the same as I hate cemeteries in perfectly nice neighborhoods.  Something doesn't sit right about the living lingering to death like that.  <br>  <br>  I can't find the link anymore, but I was "stumbling" on stumble upon once and this website came up where it showed large collections of old B&W early 1900's photos of people standing next to like dead children and babies.  Holding them sometimes in their laps...  The Dead babies would be wearing gowns that resembled christening gowns and I have never been so disturbed in my life!  But I guess that was normal back then. (the website had a name like portishead... or port head?)<br>  <br>  Just grody to me...  even if it is just the coffin.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	It is up to the families and I have no problem with that.

6JXrlnYsaa	Tell the bank manager that if they don't stop harassing you, you will file a complaint with your state Banking Department.<br>  Then do it.<br>  <br>  go to www.usa.gov.<br>  In the right hand column, click "state government".<br>  Then click your state.<br>  Follow the links to the state Department of Banking, or some such title.<br>  If you can't find an agency that seems to fit the topic, email the governor's office and ask where to file your complaint.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Have you actually gone to the bank in person and talked to the MANAGER?  This is starting to sound like an email scam.<br>  The bank has no business telling you what you can do with your money.<br>  <br>  AND NEITHER DO THE PEOPLE ON YA.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Don't let the naysayers get you down. You did a patriotic thing by going on a shopping spree, and stimulating the economy. Tell the bank to stick it. It's none of their business.<br>  <br>  Hang on to the rest for a rainy day. You never know when you might need it.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	So much for saving for a rainy day.<br>  <br>  Don't you see the storm clouds? Hell, it's raining hard in my area. Over 10% unemployment.|`|AA10925759	To be honest most people don't go on a spending spree. It is your money and spending it does not mean that you are a criminal..... it is a security measure. <br>  <br>  I have a ton of money in the bank. But if the bank sees multiple charges rather quick it can flag. They want to make sure that someone has not stolen the card.<br>  <br>  A very big flag on the computer is buying a lot of electronics. People who steal cards or numbers generally run out and buy those things that can be sold.<br>  <br>  You took out a big wad of cash. People who have bank cards have no real reason to do that. Use your card to pay for whatever and pull a bit out in cash when needed. But that much is of course suspicious. <br>  <br>  You get the drift..... you do indeed look like a criminal but they are only giving you issue in order to protect you. You canceling direct deposit compounds it.<br>  <br>  Call the bank or go there.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	Because when someone fraudelently uses another's card, they often spend quickly and withdraw cash.  It looks suspicious to them.

For all they know, you could be buying bombs to set off at the local mall.<br>  <br>  All financial firms, including banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, etc must have systems in place that 'notice' things like this, then they must ask these questions. People have had their funds frozen for not complying. Just tell them what they want to know and be done with it<br>  <br>  They're not trying to harrass you, they're just doing their job. It may not be right, or any of their business, but they are required to do this.<br>  <br>  Look up the Patriot Act for more info.<br>  <br>  I do agree with the above poster. It is indeed quite childish and frankly, anyone spending that much money on those specific items you bought, well, is most likely a criminal. No offense, but it's just the truth.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	They probably just want to verify that you are the actual account owner, anyone could answer your phone and say they are you.  You should just take your ID and go to the bank to prove that it was you who spent the money.<br>  <br>  No, most people don't spend 4k in one shopping spree unless they have no other responsibilities  It is great that you didn't need the money to pay off any debt, but it will be another year before you get another tax refund, that is a long time before you get another spending spree.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|eulMjLtPaa	Your activity is very unusual for your account, and they just want to verify that you are indeed the account holder and the circumstances.<br>  <br>  I would be very grateful that the bank is keeping an eye on your account.

The bank was doing YOU a favor by watching out for suspicious activity. In response to "Don't MOST people go on sprees", No, they don't.

So it's not like he took the money away from anyone -- it was given to him, by many millions of people. |`|AA10565336	He's not waving it in my face.

VX16L24Taa	? Animal Luvr ? <br>  <br>  The thing is yes your cousin is and adult but there is something that she has to sign along with her parents. A form that she can get from the main office. Once that is signed the principal, her vice principal and guardians will have to witness and sign the paper. After that she can change the numbers she wants to school to call, for example her cell phone. Also she can sign her self in and out of school. <br>  <br>  If she skips, even though her parents wont find out, and ground her or something, which she should know better from being an adult know... as i said thought her parents wont know she will still have detentions and if things get bad, suspensions could be in order. <br>  <br>  You and your cousin sound like very smart ladies, you should have a talk with her (not saying you haven't :P) and she if there’s anything going on. It could be something simple, or serious. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	I agree that at 18, you are an adult. You have the option of dropping out of school without parental consent. Being considered an adult, and acting like one is two different things. Either drop out or attend daily. You can still be failed in school and not graduate. After age 18, they can also decide whether you can attend or not.|`|QjS3zl3Yaa	They day you turn 18 is the day you are an adult. You can do what ever you want now.

A high school diploma is nice when looking for a job.|`|9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	Yes you can.  <br>  <br>  However you still have to go by "school rules" as you are a student and would follow under the same rules as a 14 year old.  <br>  <br>  What they consider an excused absence, might still need to be cleared by a guardian.  That would be a school rule.|`|YgR0jBo2aa	haha! no. Well you can make that choice but it seems like a stupid one. Think of the consequences.

I wondered the same thing when I was your age (only a few years ago), and found out the government's definition of an adult doesn't have to be followed by institutions like schools. They set the rules, and they force you to follow them until you leave. I know it sucks. Sorry.|`|AA10123414	An adult student can excuse themselves from class.

But if the 18 year old still lives with parents, parents often want to exercise some control over them, and I think that's fair.|`|mbshLuFfaa	Of course you can do what you wish.Providing of course they have their own income and living quarters.You couldn't expect parents to provide that as well could you?

rHwE5Rkbaa	The shots fired at funerals and memorial ceremonies are NOT 21 gun salutes - they are called simply, 3-round volleys.  The practice stems from the 1600's when they would take breaks on battlefields to treat the injured and collect the dead.  The collecting side would signal to their enemies that they were done by firing a three round volley.<br>  <br>  The practice has evolved slightly to be used as a final goodbye to fallen military members, politicians and law-enforcement folks, as well as fire fighters.  Combined with the playing of Taps, it is VERY moving.<br>  <br>  There are usually between three and seven riflemen in the squad, but can be done solo or with a whole slew of folks.<br>  <br>  The shots are usually done at about a four to five second interval, but there is no set standard.<br>  <br>  The Supervisor of the Rifle Squad uses standard orders.<br>  (this considers the squad is in a line formation (side by side).<br>  "READY"<br>  "AIM"<br>  "FIRE"<br>  "READY"<br>  "AIM"<br>  "FIRE"<br>  "READY"<br>  "AIM"<br>  "FIRE"<br>  "PRESENT ARMS" (this is when Taps is played)<br>  "ORDER ARMS"<br>  "PORT ARMS"<br>  "RIGHT FACE"<br>  "FORWARD MARCH" (and they depart)<br>  <br>  With the M-16, WITHOUT a blank adapter, on the first command of "READY" the rifle squad steps forward with their left foot.  On "AIM" they bring the rifle up to their shoulder at about a +15 degree angle, lower their heads slightly like they are actually aiming, and put their fingers on the triggers.  On "FIRE" they all immediately squeeze off a round, drop the rifle to the position of port arms (across their body at chest level), and step back to the position of Attention.<br>  <br>  The next two rounds run like this: On READY, the firers reach up with their right hand to the forward assist and eject the spent casing, letting the bolt slide home - and as the bolt is seating, they step forward with their left foot.  The rest is the same.<br>  <br>  If the M-16's DO have blank adapters, the firers don't bother ejecting the spent casings.<br>  <br>  I've done well over 500 memorial services and funerals as part of the honor guard - both as Rifle Squad Leader, Rifleman, flag detail, or playing Taps.|`|NxPPdCSjaa	The 21 Gun salute is reserved for heads of state.

I have attended many funerals for our men and women in uniform and never been able to keep the tears back, even though I never met the person.  I have seen my other brother and sister Patriot Guard Riders have tears running down their cheeks as well.<br>  When the ceremony is over, they collect the shell casings, not to reuse, but to not leave on the ground.  Often, we have given a shell casing to the wife/mother/husband/father, which ever is there.  Our ride captains have often asked for the casings to give to family members.  <br>  Unfortunately, the military doesn't have very many available buglers for military funerals.  The bugle actually has a chip that is inserted inside the bell of the bugle and plays taps.  The bugler does nothing but stand there holding the bugle.<br>  If you get the chance, watch the movie TAKING CHANCE starring Kevin Bacon, about a U.S.M.C.

Each gun is manned by a sergeant and two gunners, firing at command and instantly reloading for the next volley.<br>  <br>  For other military funerals seven riflemen are marched on the field at a comfortable distance from the funeral plot site where the mourners and officials will sit.<br>  <br>  The time delays between each volley is determinate upon the locking and loading of an additional round by the riflemen. Usually, the rifle is a semi-automatic piece, such as the old M-1 or M-14. Times have changed much since I was on the Honor Guard details of 1961 at Fort Leavenworth so other rifle weaponry may be used.<br>  <br>  Usually, a senior noncom or junior officer commands the firing squad, or honor guard detail. Upon marching the unit to the specified location, the guard leader commands, Detail, Halt! Left, Face! Order, Arms! Parade, Rest!<br>  <br>  At the time when the firing squad is to execute its duties by firing three volleys the guard leader then commands: Guard, Attention! Port, Arms! Ready, (at this preparatory command, the detail faces either half-left or half-right, loads the chamber, and then brings the rifle stock to the right cheek.) The next commands of execution are: Aim, Fire!<br>  <br>  At the firing of the weapon, each soldier quickly resumes the position of Port, Arms, and at the preparatory command of Ready, repeats the unlocking and loading sequence, bringing the stock of the rifle to the cheek, and waits for the command, Fire.<br>  <br>  At the end of the 21-rifle salute, the guard leader commands, Present, Arms! for the taps to be played. At the conclusion of taps, the command of Order, Arms is given and then Parade, Rest. They do not march off the grounds until after the mourners leave.

From the other side of the fence..................<br>  <br>  <br>  Received the following from someone who worked at S.W. BELL in Mexico City:<br>  <br>  'I spent five years working in Mexico. I worked under a tourist Visa for three months and could legally renew it for three more months. After that you were working Illegally. I was technically illegal for three weeks waiting on the FM3 approval.<br>  <br>  'During that six months our Mexican and U.S. attorneys were working to secure a permanent work visa called a 'FM3'. It was in addition to my U.S. passport that I had to show each time I entered and left the country. My wife's was the same, except hers did not permit her to work.<br>  <br>  'To apply for the FM3, I needed to submit the following notarized originals (not copies):<br>  <br>       1. Birth certificate for my wife and me.<br>       2. Marriage certificate.<br>       3. High school transcripts and proof of graduation.<br>       4. College transcripts for every college I attended and proof of graduation.<br>       5. Two letters of recommendation from supervisors I had worked for at least one year.<br>       6. A letter from the St. Louis Chief of Police indicating that I had no arrest record in the U.S. and no outstanding warrants and, was 'a citizen in good standing.<br>       7. 'Finally, I had to write a letter about myself that clearly stated why there was no Mexican citizen with my skills and why my skills were important to Mexico. We called it our 'I am the greatest person on Earth' letter. It was fun to write.<br>  <br>  'All of the above were in English that had to be translated into Spanish and be certified as legal translations, and our signatures notarized. It produced a folder about 1.5 inches thick with English on the left side an d Spanish on the right.<br>  <br>  Once they were completed my wife and I spent about five hours, accompanied by a Mexican attorney, touring Mexican government office locations and being photographed and fingerprinted at least three times at each location, and we remember at least four locations where we were instructed on Mexican tax, labor, housing, and criminal law and that we were required to obey their laws or face the consequences. We could not protest any of the government's actions or we would be committing a felony. We paid out four <br>  thousand dollars in fees and bribes to complete the process. When this was done we could legally bring in our household goods that were held by U.S. Customs in Laredo, Texas. This meant we had rented furniture in Mexico while awaiting our goods. There were extensive fees involved here that the company paid.<br>  <br>  'We could not buy a home and were required to rent at very high rates and under contract and compliance with Mexican law.<br>  <br>  'We were required to get a Mexican driver' s license. This was an amazing process. The company arranged for the licensing agency to come to our headquarters location with their photography and fingerprint equipment and the laminating machine. We showed our U.S. license, were photographed and fingerprinted again and issued the license instantly after paying out a six dollar fee. We did not take a written or driving test and never received instructions on the rules of the road. Our only instruction was to never give a <br>  policeman your license if stopped and asked. We were instructed to hold it against the inside window away from his grasp. If he got his hands on it you would have to pay ransom to get it back. 'We then had to pay and file Mexican income tax annually using the <br>  number of our FM3 as our ID number. The company's Mexican accountants did this for us and we just signed what they prepared. It was about twenty legal size pages annually.<br>  <br>  'The FM3 was good for three years and renewable for two more after paying more fees.<br>  <br>  'Leaving the country meant turning in the FM3 and certifying we were  leaving no debts behind and no outstanding legal affairs (warrants, tickets or liens) before our household goods were released to customs.'<br>  <br>   'It was a real adventure and if any of our Senators or Congressmen went through it once, they would have a different attitude toward Mexico.<br>  <br>  'The Mexican government uses its vast military and police forces to keep its citizens intimidated and compliant. They never protest at their capitol or government offices, but do protest daily in front of the United States Embassy. The U.S. Embassy looks like a strongly reinforced fortress and during most protests the Mexican military surrounds the block with their men standing shoulder to shoulder in full riot gear to protect the embassy. These protests are never shown on U.S. or Mexican TV. There is a large public park across the street where they do their protesting. Anything can cause a protest such as proposed law changes in California or Texas.'<br>  <br>  Please feel free to share this with everyone who thinks we are being hard on the illegals.|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	WHAT PART OF ILLEGAL I.E.

They were men of their time, not role models for today.<br>  <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-reverence.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-reverenc...</a><br>  Capitalism, and the imperialist system that develops upon its economic foundations, is the main cause of human poverty, exploitation, violence and suffering in the modern world. As a system of socio-economic organization, capitalism long ago exhausted its historically progressive role. The blood-drenched history of the twentieth century – with its two world wars, innumerable “local” conflicts, the nightmare of Nazism and other forms of military-police dictatorship, eruptions of genocide and communal pogroms – is an unanswerable indictment of the capitalist system. The number of victims claimed by capitalist-inspired violence runs into the hundreds of millions. And this figure does not include the consignment of the peoples of entire continents to unrelenting poverty, with all its attendant miseries.<br>  <br>  The gigantic scale of the existing productive forces and the extraordinary advances in technology are more than sufficient not only to abolish poverty but also to guarantee every human being on the planet a high standard of living. Culture should be flowering amidst unprecedented material wealth. But, instead, conditions of life are deteriorating for the working class, and human culture, deprived of perspective and hope for the future, is in deep crisis. The source of the contradiction between what is and what should be is a global economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, and the irrational division of the world into rival nation-states.<br>  <br>  All efforts to raise the living standards of the working class and address serious social problems run up against the barrier of private ownership of the means of production, the anarchy of the capitalist market, the economic imperatives of the profit system, and, last but not least, the insatiable greed and money-madness of the ruling class itself. The claim that the capitalist market is the infallible allocator of resources and the supremely wise arbiter of social needs stands utterly discredited amidst the endless series of speculative scandals and multi-billion dollar bankruptcies that have rocked the world economic system during the past decade. The boundary lines between “legitimate” financial transactions and criminal fraud have narrowed to the point of being almost invisible. The separation of the process of personal wealth accumulation from the production and creation of real value is an expression of the general putrefaction of the capitalist system.<br>  <br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep2008/prin-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep200...</a>|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	I suspect some people have an issue with it but not the people who believe in the entrepreneurial spirit of America.  It may be possible that you are confusing the idea that the government's intervention is strictly limited to those businesses that were failing and required government assistance with the incorrect notion that the government intends on controlling all businesses.  The fact is that if you run your business properly and make a profit, more power to you!  But don't cry "SOCIALISM" when the government is forced to step in to save your livelihood and then puts restrictions on how you can run your operations.  Face it, if your decisions were sound, you wouldn't be in the position of having to ask the government for help now, would you?|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Because unbridled capitalism allows the strong to enslave the weak, and the rich keep getting richer by siphoning money from those less powerful.

i5FP4Vbraa	The UK electorate want immigration controlled and that goes for both Labour and Conservative voters.<br>  <br>  The UK.gov is trying to shut the door before it's too late.<br>  <br>  Voters are starting to think seriously about voting for the BNP [British National Party].  The BNP already have one member on the London Assembley and are the official opposition on the council of Dagenham in East London.  The BNP also have one councillor on the council of Seven Oaks in Kent.  I'm not sure where else, but the BNP is now being taken seriously, not just by the working class, but also by middle class voters.  The BNP will stop all immigration.  Full stop.<br>  <br>  A load of crap has been made up concerning who the British people are.  Well, I'll tell you who we are.  We are a bunch of assorted Germanic tribes - Celts, Saxons, Danes, Normans, Vikings, Dutch, Germans and other Celtic-Germans etc.  That's who we are.<br>  <br>  The rest is a load of cobblers.<br>  <br>  Where I live, according to the last count in 2000 there are 0.9% [less than one percent] of Hindus, yet we have UK's biggest Hindu Fest every year.  There's no English, Welsh, Scottish or Irish fests, just foreign ones.<br>  <br>  Labour don't listen to us.<br>  <br>  I have waited now six weeks for a reply to a letter I sent to my Labour MP on an issue concerning MPs expenses.  I only got a reply yesterday and only after I had contacted someone else in parliament.<br>  <br>  Labour ignore us at their peril.  They have ignored the commoners of Dagenham - now it's gonna cost them dear.<br>  <br>  Same thing might happen elsewhere.  Too early to say.<br>  <br>  Next time out [2010] my partner and me will be voting.  Not sure who for yet.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	It's powerless by choice.

We could also entice back to Britain many of the brain-drain generation of highly-skilled professionals, who left because of 'rip-off' Britain and the increasingly depressed atmosphere of living under authoritarian Labour Party rule.

HhNf0SOaaa	That depends on who you talk to in the UK doesn't it? Some have issues with high taxes and a failing NHS that denies coverage to the very old, the very sick, the obese, people who choose to drink, or smoke or do things that Big Brother Government deems nasty.<br>  <br>  My grandparents were immigrants who came to America in 1951 to escape this kind of government. They saw first hand what happened when the Government told the people that they would enact laws that were intrusive for the "public good" After a time, their friends disappeared into the night. My great uncle was jailed for 2 weeks for no reason. If the government wanted your house and two cows for the public good, they would take it. There was no freedom of speech. There was no industry. There was poverty and dependence on a government that cared about itself and not the people. All this was done for the generations to come, the children. It was a lie. My grandparents left their house behind, their family, all their worldly possessions to run away from this kind of thinking. They came to America. They hated FDR and his New Deal. They had heard this language in Czechoslovakia and they mistrusted it. They accepted no welfare and they worked hard to build a life for themselves here. In CZ, they were inteligensia. In America, they were factory workers. They never drove a Lexus or lived in a huge house but they accomplished a good retirement, a place of their own, two kids who went on to a successful college career that both of them worked to pay for without a grant or student loan. They always voted Republican because they saw the seeds of where they came from in the Democrat party. <br>  <br>  Our founding fathers were British. They came from a country that was owned by the King. They did not want that in america. In 200 years, we Americans grew rich and successful. We provided the world with research, great inventions, great industry and great opportunity. Our poor would be considered rich in any other part of the world. We have more individuals seeking a new life here than in your country. Sorry my UK friend, but not many are knocking on YOUR door unless they want a hand out. What FDR did with the New Deal is now being questioned. Maybe it wasn't the great idea that he thought it was. What really releived the Depression had nothing to do with the welfare state. It had to do with industry generated by WWII. Statistically speaking, we have just as many poor in this country now as we did then. Socialism doesn't work. It creates dependence on Government, not dependence on ones self to achieve greatness. My Aunt lives in UK. Trust me, she doesn't say a thing about living in Nirvana. <br>  <br>  One famous Brit said, A Government big enough to give you all you want, is powerful enough to take all you have. <br>  Fortunatlely, he came here and helped found a really great nation. Not perfect but we as Americans should not be looking to the European way of solving issues when it was the European way that our founding fathers avoided creating here. It wasn't by being Europe that Europeans travelled far and wide to be a part of. It was by being different from Europe that attracted our many diverse cultures and opportunities. I hope our citizens are mindful of that as we move forward.|`|Wv1K0fRiaa	Regardless of how people feel about capitalism, it has been this economic philosophy that has fueled the American dream.  The idea of individual responsibility and accountability that has motivated people to become self made millionaires.  The satisfaction of knowing that everything you have you have earned on your own.  It's the idea that brought millions of immigrants to the country all in hopes of being able to get just one piece of that dream.<br>  <br>  But as it is with most things, too much can be a bad thing.  For all its good capitalism can also foster greed.  The difficult thing to do is find the happy medium where a government's economic policy still allows for the pursuit of happiness and unlimited opportunity to earn while at the same time reducing corruption.<br>  <br>  Nothing is perfect, socialism comes with it's own set of problems in the form of failed welfare programs and a stunted incentive to earn.  Perhaps the ideal system is one that incorporates the best of both economic systems?|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Some people are more concerned about names than about results. The Cold War began at the end of WWII, and most Americans became anti-communist at that time. Many people don't understand the difference between socialism and communism, and governments run by communist parties have often called themselves "socialists."<br>  <br>  The other thing is that people don't call it socialism when it applies to them. Thus the economic bailouts of Wall Street aren't called socialist, although it is hard to think of a better term (welfare for the rich, redistribution upward aren't politically viable).<br>  <br>  Lastly, while the UK has socialized medicine, you're the only person I've ever heard call it a socialist country.|`|AclRRttWaa	Socialism is considered 'bad' because it undermines the basic economic principles our country has historically operated under for centuries.  Sure, there are programs here and there that can be, and should be, considered socialist, but the fact of the matter is that you reap what you achieve.  The 'American Dream' isn't achieved through government entitlement programs, socialistic legislation, or handouts. It's achieved through hard work, motivation and entrepreneurship.  The last being the sole factor that separates this country from the majority of the countries throughout the world.    |`|U2kgjpTvaa	Generally, in the US, it's mostly used as a buzzword to try and demean someone politically.

From a conservative perspective, socialism is an economic system whereby the means of production are seized and monopolized by the government without compensation to the builders of the capital, and where investments, production, distribution, income, prices, and economic justice are administered by a government nomenklatura that regulate the transfer of money, goods (including capital goods), and services primarily through taxation and regularized and institutionalized aggressive coercion."<br>  <br>  It goes against the very principles of American freedom.|`|XylWeV6Jaa	Really?

If you contribute half of your hard earned money to the pot, would you say that is fair when your neighbor is the one collecting it and not contributing back. Now go ask any citizen of your country if they really think highly of their socialized health care plan. I can tell you the answer, and you're not going to like it. Socialism works in theory, but human nature contradicts most of its principles. Remember the USSR...did that really work out in the end? If you have a utopian society where everyone actually pulls their fair share of the community loads...socialism is fabulous. But look at people around the world and tell me they are contributing fairly to the pot. 45% of americans don't even pay taxes. 5% of americans and american companies contribute 95% of the overall taxes to fill the pot. Tell me that is fair, and explain to me how they should be expected to contribute more. Socialism doesn't work in a society built on the principles of individual freedom. If you take our freedom away to make things equal in the name of socialism. What to you have left to look forward to, why work just to get the fruits of your labor taken from you and given to those that sit idly by expecting their piece of the pie. That is why socialism doesn't work, it goes against human nature, it promotes laziness and creates a lower standard of living. Give a hungry man a fish and he will return for more = socialism. Teach a man to fish and he can sustain himself and his family = capitalism.

The stories were all over the news for the past two weeks. At the debate, she could only answer the questions she'd been coached on. Everything else caused her eye to twitch (or maybe that was a wink). It also made her flustered and she ultimately ended up changing the subject and talking about what she wanted to talk about instead of answering the question. She wore her lack of knowledge on her sleeve, so to speak. I will admit she sent a few zingers Bidens way, but he sent even more her way. <br>  <br>  And the big one for me? She has no regard for women's rights. As a woman, that offends me. Jealous? Nope. I have no reason to be.

Meanwhile, these illegals are having babies on American soil and then taking advantage of the welfare system courtesy of tax money paid in by the now unemployed working Americans. Now the tax money is disappearing and everyone's wondering why! Amnesty is NOT the answer. Amnesty would just encourage more and more illegals to sneak across! It would solve nothing! <br>  <br>  Border enforcement needs to be the #1 priority before deportation, amnesty, or anything else can be considered. It's like a leak in a water pipe. First, you must fix the leak, THEN clean up the spilled water. We need to fix the leaks in our border, THEN clean up the mess that was made!|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	Chuck gave an excellent answer- But I disagree with considering amnesty.<br>  None of the illegals deserve amnesty. Every single one is a criminal, maybe not dangerous, but still a criminal. They use stolen IDs and Soc Sec #s. They work here illegally, they cross illegally, they live here illegally, All are criminals.<br>  <br>  Enforcement and deporting is fine, but first we MUST take away incentives. If there is no reason to come, they won't.  Birthright citizenship (access to welfare) is the biggest draw. Take it away and over half the problem is solved.<br>  Take away personal responsibility from a person and they will do whatever they please because they do not fear. They are no consequences.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Both. As they are caught they should be deported. Until then, enforce our immigration laws, secure our borders, fine/jail anyone that hires illegals, no freebies for illegals, etc. If they can't find work or receive free things they will they will return to their own country.|`|zAhlNl6oaa	"WE ARE A NATION OF  ~LEGAL~ IMMIGRANTS" those "crashing our party" sneaking in here illegaly-get the FiCK out!!".|`|yTdQUqVRaa	It can't be one or the other, it needs to be both.<br>  <br>  They also need to remove the incentives for illegal immigration, such as increasing the punishments for companies.<br>  <br>  Those who talk about Obama's amnesty really ought to read the immigration platform he used during his campaign again. It talks about increasing border security, taking a harder line with companies that hire illegals and doesn't grant full amnesty to everyone. Assuming it's passed in to law it merely gives those who are in good standing the opportunity to pay a fine, learn English, then go to the back of the line.|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	Both!!! these are not immigrants they are ILLEGAL immigrants and only here to take advantage of US resources and send money back to their relatives. Round them all up deport them and close the border, I thought this country was concerned about " Homeland Security" then why do we have such a long unprotected frontier, both north and south?  Illegals drive down real estate, devalue work, lower standards of living, and send billions out the country !!!! STOP THE MADNESS!!!!!|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Age old question.Until Americans get the humanitarian mentality out of their minds and quit worrying about how these people have to live we will never rectify this situation.The absolute first place to start is not to give them anything when they come into this country,not even a meal when they are caught.This crap of giving them a check up to make sure they are ok is nonsense.As soon as you catch them load em up and throw them out with as much force as you can....The influx can never be stopped but the end result can.|`|REiQzRB3aa	Both. The castle doctrine should also be granted to those protecting the nation. If we see someone crossing the border and coming into our "home" we should have the right to defer them back or shoot.|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	The best way is to punish businesses that employee them. <br>  <br>  Feed a stray cat and they will stay in your back yard. Stop feeding them and they will go home.|`|Vpq8CZQHaa	Both!  Boot 'em out and keep 'em out!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	Both.  If they get caught they need to be sent back. Period!|`|iryMpZYwaa	Both... Yawn....|`|J7pNK6fYaa	Both!<br>  <br>  I think that every ILLEGAL INVADER should be deported NOW!<br>  <br>  I also think that there should be an armed solider every 100 yards along the border with orders to shoot ANYONE coming in to this country ILLEGALY|`|UiUPOA0laa	Actually enforce our laws, deport them when they are caught, crack down strictly.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Neither. Instead send to jail the scumbag employers who employ the illegals. Remember that illegals come here for jobs. If there is no one to hire them, they will not come and the ones here will leave all by themselves.<br>  <br>  Throw a few hundred company owners in jail and the illegals will go home on their own.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Both, as well as attrition through enforcement of the ban on employing illegal immigrants.
AA10118655	No. This would be a form of conscription, which lowers the quality of the military. Forcing someone to go into the military when they do not want to does not give highly motivated people that care about the work they do.|`|k56mmj2eaa	well everyone has there opinion. But allot of us are on federal money because we have been in the military. and are disabled. but some of us still try to work at jobs we can do.|`|RhDPB70Baa	Unless they have a damn good reason (injured in active duty for instance) they shouldn't get unemployment money at all.  Get a job.|`|mHDKWOODaa	No! in fact they should  (if able) be put to work.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Many of them already have....and are now disabled Veterans. The majority are unable to work....due to old age, disability, or being a child.|`|AA11707728	People on federal money look at any sort of work they do as just going through the motions as a way to get their check.  In a business situation, that will cause the business to fail.  In a combat situation, that will cause people to die.<br>  <br>  How about this.  We DON'T give them any money to begin with.

Somehow, people think that his commentary is pure political stuff without realizing that he must play to his audience.  It is the inability to take themselves lightly (an ability that Limbaugh does possess although presented dryly) that has caused liberal talk radio to fail.  Not everything is political and not every political issue is important.  Limbaugh understands this.<br>  <br>  Then there is the fact that he just loves to get under liberals' (progressives') skin.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Rush is the voice of those that are among the 28%<br>  <br>  you know the whiners<br>  the sore loosers<br>  the obstructionists<br>  the Rather see America fail crowd|`|oVmGcRVtaa	No but he is the guiding beacon of the trolls that frequent this format|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  He is great at making you guys angry though!|`|AEtGbSs6aa	Rush is a Conservative, not a Republican...oh and btw..if he were the voice, and Republicans DID listen to him..Republicans WOULD of been elected<br>  <br>  If you actually listened to Rush, you would know this|`|0jmVA50Jaa	He wants to think he is, but the horrible truth is, his voice bellers out in favor of the Republicans only after he has used his oxy.|`|k6hicodfaa	Yes.  And that's why they are having problems recruiting minorities, women, and the educated class to vote Republican.|`|1NO10YfPaa	The Republican Party has no voice.  It just listens to Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	No, he's the voice of conservatives.|`|ubrOdZqMaa	No,Just the voice of people who are REAL Americans.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Heck no.  Not MY Republican party|`|xSdnsSojaa	If he is, then the Republican party is in serious trouble.<br>  <br>  Wait a minute .... they *are* in serious trouble...<br>  <br>  As it stands now, the GOP has become a radical regional party that no longer represents the views of the majority of Americans. The lies and hate-mongering of self-styled "pundits" like Limbaugh, Coulter, Hannity, O'Reilly etc. aren't helping matters. The Republican party is digging its own grave, and is too blinded by its irrational hatred of the opposition to have the good sense to realize it.|`|x6mfPijYaa	Well that would be pretty lame, he is not an elected official.  He is a fat mouthed radio hack who makes money by spewing hate and dividing Americans.  He is not a patriot he is a self-serving pig, so in that respect he is the voice of the Republican Party.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	No, he's the big mouth of the Republican party. There's a difference.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Not exclusively. There are several voices that will bring about the conservative movement. He's one of them but not the leader.|`|YCL50xgnaa	He's the voice of the American whacked out high school dropouts.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	No. So for the other 549,6897 that will ask this today, you can now stop posting.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	Apparently not since they don't do anything he says.|`|zw69DN4iaa	If he is, that might explain why Obama's in the White House now.

If we are in economic doldrums expect a significant shift but not to overturn the majority.<br>  <br>  If we continue on our current path for another couple of months and then go into the doldrums we could even see a reversal of the majority.<br>  <br>  The Democrats have been given a chance to show how their economic and social policies can work.

Ad9GHlh1aa	When I was 11 yrs old me my older brother, younger sister, and mother came home from foodshooping it was around 10 pm and we reached the front of our apthouse when 3 men came out of a car parked across the street. Right away we knew something was akward and my mother got so scared she couldn't get the door to open even after the put a gun on her side. When they finally got the door open they came in through us on the bed and cut out the telephone wire from the wall and tied us all up except our lil sister who was 5 yrs old at the time. We though they were going to kill us because they didn't even have masks on. Me and my brother were crying like crazy and that's when they put a pillow over my head and told my brother if he doesn't shut up they are going to shoot me. My mother started begging for our lives and said they could have everything and do anything to herbut leave us alone, that's when they raped out mother next to us in the bed. When they finished and took all our money and jewels they said they put a bomb in the house which I believed being so young. When they left my mother was partially loose because of what happend to her and she set us free and called the cops. After that we had to go to physcologist every monday and wed because it filled my heart with hate and I wanted to killl every male I saw.

The combination of these insures that specific rights exist and the government can't a abridge them without cause and without adherence to a consistent, even handed-process.

6JXrlnYsaa	Pay attention, people.<br>  The question was WHEN...<br>  <br>  The main body of the US Constitution was adopted in 1787.<br>  The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791.<br>  13th Amendment - 1865<br>  14th Amendment - 1868<br>  15th Amendment - 1870<br>  19th Amendment - 1920<br>  <br>  The Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 and is NOT part of the constitution.<br>  <br>  The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 and is NOT part of the constitution.<br>  <br>  Gee. I wonder what would happen if you READ THE CONSTITUTION.<br>  <br>  www.constitutionfacts.com|`|IGcS9K62aa	A few almost right answers. The most basic civil rights were given with the Bill of Rights (the first 10 amendments). <br>  <br>  The person who mentioned the reconstruction amendments was almost there. The 13th freed the slaves. The 14th gave them citizenship and constitutional protection. It also counted them as citizens for representative purposes (they previosly only counted as 3/5th's a person). The 15th gave them the right to vote :The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. (Still only men though) <br>  <br>  Women were given the vote with the 19th Amendment: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.<br>  <br>  Then the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extended our modern definition of civil rights:<br>  <br>  [It was] An Act to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States of America to provide relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity, and for other purposes.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though the Civil Rights Act was an act rather than a constitutional amendment. You might want to also keep in mind that the interpretation of the constitution by the Supreme Court is equally as important in the proliferation of civil rights (i.e. Brown v. The Board of Education, Topeka).|`|v7Wflu78aa	Before it was adopted.|`|aMH04aSvaa	The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments of the constitution slavery was abolished in the 13th amendment the 14th amendment gave natural born citizens the right to vote the 15th gave all men the right to vote including ex slaves and the 19th gave women the right to vote if thats what your asking|`|AA11130104	What you refer to as "civil rights" is the bill of rights and is the first part of the constitution|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	1964...when Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.

He has really faced some major tests.  Probably more than any other President.  Between what we have paid out for our disasters, but also the financial help to other countries with their disasters.  The does add up.  It is really easy to be ARMCHAIR PRESIDENTS. Yes we have hit financial problems, but until 1 year ago, no one really knew what was going on.  We all were living our lives without any complaints.  The mortgage crisis came from Despicable lending practices and people taking out loans they had NO BUSINESS taking out.  Come on if you are making $40,000 yearly you do not take a loan out for a $300,000 home.  People did NOT LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS and now are paying a price.  Which we have all probably had to do in our lives.

They were able to cause "concern" over her religious affiliations, while making Obama's religious affiliations muted.<br>  <br>  There are two jobs to being a president:  (1) GET the job.   then  (2) DO the job.<br>  <br>  Obama has shown his ability in the first one.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	Yes.  Real Christianity, anyway.  They oppose putting a shirt on the poor (welfare), feeding the hungry (food stamps), forgiveness of sin (mandatory minimums), and healing the sick who can't pay for the privilege (Medicaid).  Of course, don't forget his activism regarding money changers (Wall Street).  Insulting liberals is fashionable, but arguing with the narrow minded is like casting pearls before swine.<br>  <br>  Hunginchicago69 - Single issue voting works for one track minds.  So is a miscarriage due to a fall, manslaughter?  Can you find anywhere in the Bible where Jesus used a condom or other birth control?  See what Karen Armstrong says about the volumes of religious texts that AREN'T included in a tighty little Bible.<br>  <br>  Q Cont - Do you have a passage I can look at regarding his opposition to helping "lazy bums?"  Or like so much of fundamentalism, ya'll just make this stuff up as you go?<br>  <br>  There is a section of America lathered up about a single issue - abortion, and the self-righteous belief that God/Jesus is on their side.  They want teens to get knocked up, so they oppose teaching them about proper birth control methods.  They think suicide, assisted or not, should be illegal.  Yet somehow they get excited and equally righteous about someone being killed via the death penalty even though that level of judgment is reserved to God.  I really don't get these people and I hope their say in government only stays local.|`|IoYZBmVIaa	GOP Christianity is a farce. <br>  They have also given Christianity a terrible name. <br>  |`|6AgnCKCPaa	Of course not..<br>  <br>  Conservatives believe in donating their own money while liberals prefer to use other peoples' money..|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	It's kind of hard for me to not see a contradiction between what Christianity is supposed to represent, and either the Democrat or Republican parties.  For one thing, both parties are really just one party.  They are both working for things that I would consider incompatible with the Christian faith, although a lot of people have strange ideas about what constitutes a Christian.<br>  <br>  I think preemptive strikes against nations who haven't attacked us is certainly a violation of the Just War principle.  I think the stealing of our gold in 1933, and forcing us to use inflationary debt notes for currency certainly violates the Biblical directive about just weights and measures.<br>  <br>  The acceptance of "alternate life styles", and abortion fly in the face of centuries of Christian ethics.  The growth of the Welfare State, and now the destruction of our freedoms, supposedly to "fight terrorism", do not follow the Christian demands that make us, individually responsible for helping those in need, and the freedom that the truth can bring us.  Rather, we have accepted the politicians false concerns about the poor, and believed a lie about terrorism, and new we are loosing our freedom.<br>  <br>  If you speak with Muslims in the Middle East, they are also outraged that the terrorist are associated with their religion.  There are over a billion Muslims in the world.  What percentage do you think are involved in terrorism?  <br>  <br>  |`|0VZ8zxkVaa	Hmm, Im not sure what Jesus would be. But he certainly isnt a liberal, at least not by modern standards. Because unlike modern liberals, Jesus didnt want equality, religious freedom and other things forced upon us. He wants those things, but not through the force of laws as governments do. He believed in free choice and free will and he would of never of advocated that people who discrimated against minorites should be punished by the government. He doesnt think morality or equality can be legislated.<br>  <br>  He believed in freedom and people themselves should choose the way they should live, not washington politicians. This is what the bible says, god doesnt want people to be forced to believe in him.<br>  <br>  Of course, it could be argued Jesus was a facist as he believed that god is the one true ruler of everything. but who knows. i dont think jesus was even real|`|AA10447614	Technically, Jesus was a reactionary, the most conservative of conservatives: His teaching is a devolution from Pharisaic law to natural law; the Beatitudes better complement the 10 Commandments than the then-developed Kashruth. His Covenant abolished the Covenant of Moses, restoring humanity to a state prior to the Fall.<br>  <br>  It's a stretch to say that Democrats uniquely ally themselves with the poor. While Democratic leaders talk big about "helping the poor", they aren't the ones in soup kitchens or taking time off work to build for Habitat for Humanity. You'll find Christians and non-Christians of both parties and no party affiliation doing this work.|`|G8roffx6aa	No no no... Jesus a liberal?<br>  <br>  Jesus didn't tell us to give our hard earned money to the govt so that they could give it to other people.  He told us to give directly.  He told us to help each other... not give it to the middle man so a % could be cut off the top.  And not so the gov't could favor the handouts and misuse the money.<br>  <br>  Jesus wouldn't have supported giving people homes they couldn't afford - just so they didn't feel left out.  He would have helped them work harder to earn the house the right way.<br>  <br>  Jesus believed in personal responsibility and sacrifice.  You work hard, and you get what you earn... you don't sulk and cry about the down times... you struggle through and then celebrate the good times (that you earned yourself.)<br>  <br>  Jesus certainly didn't put "woman's rights" above the right of an unborn child.<br>  <br>  Jesus never said that 2 men or 2 women should marry.  We should love everybody and treat everybody with respect, but that doesn't mean we lower our standards so that nobody feels leftout.|`|yoytdRGTaa	Get with the program, sister!<br>  <br>  Religious right = Republican<br>  <br>  You don't want to burn for eternity, do you?<br>  <br>  Jesus has nothing to do with modern politics.|`|AA11300514	You are correct, and yet 90% of all hard-core Republicans are also hard-core Christians.

Minimal government providing for basic needs and infrastructure<br>  2. Personal liberty is preserved at all costs<br>  3. Larger decisions are handled on a state level.<br>  <br>  Liberating the oppressed is hardly a Liberal philosophy in my mind, as liberals don't actually show the oppressed and the poor how to rise above; they just give handouts to keep them treading water indefinitely.  Conservatives, on the other hand, know that by granting total liberty (including both the liberty to succeed or fail) is the only way to truly achieve greatness.  <br>  <br>  Was it a liberal who freed the slaves?  No, it was Republican Abraham Lincoln.<br>  <br>  Was it a liberal who inspired a civil rights movement for Blacks in the 1960's?  No, it was Republican Martin Luther King Jr.<br>  <br>  Then if you want to look at which group donates more to charity, there too the end result is that conservatives donate SIGNIFICANTLY more than liberals (about 30% more), despite the fact that dollar for dollar, liberals earn more than conservatives (on average).  See link 1<br>  <br>  As for the environment, take a look at my 2nd link to see how one of the most iconic liberals and one iconic conservative actually stack up against one another.<br>  <br>  Case closed: contradictory?  No!|`|JpoqppfHaa	By being Democrat and saying you're Christian is contradictory. The moral of the story is that Jesus would condemn arbortions period and would not endorse homosexual agenda's period. God does love us all as we are his children, but you can't live in constant sin because you are essentially mocking God. Feel good Christians on the other hand could be from either party because their heart is into the world first and God second. Trust in God and dedication to living as sin-free life as possible is the key. However, morally speaking on the issues, Christian values are part of the Republicans, not Democrats!|`|W6QGI5qYaa	Jesus taught us to love those less fortunate but how does being forcibly taxed in order to help others indicate that we love them?

6OLiuM9Gaa	First, I don't know how long he was deployed or where, and I don't know what he's been through, he's probably not the guy who left. He's probably different. He's probably seen stuff, heard stuff, felt stuff, smelled stuff, done stuff, that the other guy probably couldn't imagine. Sometimes it takes time to get your feet back under you in a civilian (non-combat) context.<br>  <br>  Second: Don't go looking for trouble. A lot of changes have nothing to do with PTSD. People blame violent tempers on PTSD. I don't think, for the most part, their combat experience had anything to do with their temper. They had the temper and the violent tendencies before they left... they were just too afraid to give vent to them. In combat, they get to vent... and can even get commended for it.  <br>  <br>  Your husband is probably working it out. Give him time. Maybe he may never be as confident as you remember. Some people decry confidence as "overbearing." Or, maybe it's not confidence. Maybe before he was prone to make rash, spur-of-the-moment decisions. Maybe now, he is taking more into consideration.<br>  <br>  Third: When I came back from my first deployment (different time and different war), I shut people out almost completely. My family must have been hurt. I spent most of my time with my dog. He didn't make demands. I cried. I'm sure he didn't understand. He never spouted platitudes or tried to consoled me. He just said, "I love you." Sometimes I'd talk. I'm sure he didn't understand that either. He didn't offer any advice. He just said, "I love you." Sometimes I'd just sit with him. He'd put his head on my lap. He didn't feel uncomfortable with the silence. He just said, "I love you." Max was there for me the second time I came back too. But he didn't last until I got back the third time. But he'd done his job. He'd taught me how to cope.<br>  <br>  Relatives and friends require you to be there. Sometimes you don't want to be there. I still allow myself to "leave" in uncomfortable company. I find somebody boorish, unpleasant, uncouth, offensive, or just a boring conversationalist, I simply zone out. It would probably be more polite to excuse myself and leave physically, but this works for me. And it's not something left over from the service. I developed the ability in high school. <br>  <br>  The point is, he probably just doesn't want to have to do something or be something or someone to please people.<br>  <br>  Finally: I work with some guys coming back from the Middle East with "issues."  Yeah, some of them really need some help. But most just seem to need time to sort their brains out. And some are just there to try to get the disability.<br>  <br>  Remember, he trained for probably a year before he left. During the time he was there, the training saved his life and the lives of his buddies on any number of occasions. Now, he has to fight the impulse not to implement that training in a no-combat context. The effort takes a little time. There's no switch with which he can just turn it off. <br>  <br>  "But it's been a year and a half..." Yep. For some they have to deal with it all the rest of their lives. For some it's so painful that they wind up medicated into oblivion where they don' have to face their demons. But, for most, it just takes a little time.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it. Everybody has idiosyncrasies. As long as he doesn't become violent, or become a danger to himself or to others, just follow my don's approach. Be there when he needs you, but try not to make demands.<br>  <br>  If he does begin to exhibit dangerous tendencies, first contact his command, then the VA. I'd suggest putting it in writing and send it certified. You can also use E-mail but make sure you send it requesting an automatic return receipt. Keep copies of the messages and the receipts.<br>  <br>  If you want, tell him that an old squid said, "Thanks, and welcome back."|`|IuJjYz6gaa	How long has he been home?  A lot of that stuff can be normal if he's been home less than a year.<br>  <br>  After my husband's second deployment we got in a huge fight and I told him that I thought he had PTSD and he laughed at me.  The next day he told me that he thought I was right and got some help.  We also went to marital counseling.  Military One Source is amazing.<br>  <br>  After this last deployment he's done really well and has even gotten some counseling on his own to make sure that he is okay.<br>  <br>  My advice is to come right out and tell him that you think he needs to talk to someone. That you care about him and you just want to make sure he's okay.  Point out his symptoms.  He might rebel and tell you that you're crazy, but give him some time, he might realize that you're right.  At the very least ask him to go with you to marriage counseling and maybe the symptoms will come up in conversation.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about making him feel like he's different.  He's been to combat, of course he's different.  I personally believe that every combat veteran comes home with some form of PTSD.  I don't see how they couldn't.  I don't think there is any way that anyone can go through that without changing.  But the changes don't always have to be bad.  They can become more caring, more loving and realize that life is precious.  And those are very good things.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck. I know this is a hard thing to go through.  You thought once the deployment was over, you were past it, and now this...|`|cCBwK2EGaa	varies from person to person the main thing is to be honest with him.  You can do everything to give him his confidence back (I would say start umm how do I put this "encrougaing him alone") but in the end its up to him to make the change but encourage him every step of the way.|`|4118f39adf9adacb3d20dae6cbc502e6aa	It sounds like he may be having problems with PTSD.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to get them to admit it.  Also, until he is ready, he will not seek help on his own.  I wonder if you might try to seek family counseling through the Chaplain Family Life Center.  Maybe if both of you are going together, it would not seem so one sided. Also seeking counseling for yourself is important so that you are better equipped to help him.  PTSD is a family issue because it affects everyone he lives with, so this may be a good place to start.  I wish you the best of luck and I hope everything works out, it can be a tough road indeed.

The market, predicting an Obama presidency that would be socialist and anti-business had the largest fall in history.<br>  If the Democrats are elected it is likely to lead to a deep and prolonged recession.<br>  <br>  May I be the first to coin the term:<br>  <br>  "The Obama Recession"|`|bHqPnZ6Laa	Just because the president says he wants to do something, doesn't mean it will actually happen. There are a lot of other people who really decide what becomes a reality or what stays an idea. So if you want to live a life of leisure then go right ahead. But don't expect either candidate to help you with that.|`|PVcdO65Oaa	Obama is not promising any hand out . lmao <br>  you republicans are so dam desperate |`|o0UD2YvPaa	Obama wants tax payers to fund, bigger government, UHC (universal health care) more govt.spending, giving more to those who refuse to work.  among other things he is planning on increasing.  There is no way that 5% of the wealthiest can foot this bill, without increasing the taxes of middle america.  Obama talks about 95% of americans will not see an increase in their taxes.....what he is not telling you is that 40% of americans  do not pay taxes at all, but they are going to get my money for doing nothing........I don't think so, this is wrong on so many levels.<br>  <br>  Obama is going to raise the taxes on small business to 68%, This means that small business owners will keep 38 cents of every dollar made, no this is not profit, because govmt. taxes all income, not just profit.  Now out of this 38cents the small business owner has to pay employees, supplies (office and other) rent, insurance such as rental, and if elected med. insurance for employees. along with monthly bills such as utilities.  when you do the math, there is no way that small business owners can afford all this, so like myself....I am going to have to let the women who work for me go once the obama tax plan goes into play, and they know this.  My books are open, and they know what we take in, and what is paid out, and than what is left over is mine, and I take home less than they do when all is said and done. <br>  <br>  What Obama does not realize or maybe he does, is that it is small business who employess the lesser educated of america...those who are not college educated,, and HS drop outs.  I have a trade, and typically it is these business that are going to hurt the most.  It is a given that unemployment will increase once his taxes begins.  I wish myself and other small business owners the best of luck if Obama gets elected.  <br>  <br>  We are each responsible for our own success, it is not for the gov. to take my money to give to people who have no inspiration to do any better than sitting back waiting for a check that so many sacrificed themselves and their family time for.  If these people want to be successful, then go out and work for it, I am tired of giving free handouts to people who's only insiration is to sit on their portches and drink beer while watching others break their backs to earn a living for their family.|`|tkX8VMDSaa	<br>  Dumb speaks as dumb is.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  <br>  Can't handle the truth?

If it passes the house, then it goes tot he Senate where you will contact your senator.<br>  <br>  However, be very careful of what you support.  The more laws passed, and more taxes levied, the more law breakers and tax evaders there are.

Over 900 banks eventually closed and many people went unemployed. To combat this, Van Buren fought for an Independent Treasury to help ensure the safe deposit of funds. <br>  Issues arose with British held Canada during Van Buren's time in office. One such event was the so-called "Aroostook War" of 1839. This nonviolent conflict arose over thousands of miles where the Maine/Canadian border had no defined boundary. When a Maine authority tried to send Canadians out of the region, militias were called forward. Van Buren was able to make peace through General Winfield Scott before fighting began. <br>  <br>  Texas applied for statehood after gaining independence in 1836. If admitted, it would have become another slave state which was opposed by the Northern states. Van Buren, wishing to help fight against sectional slavery issues, agreed with the North. Also, Van Buren continued Jackson's policies concerning the Seminole Indians. In 1842, the Second Seminole War ended with the Seminoles being defeated.|`|ia2kz4qyaa	martin van buren 1837-1841

bnJPvsVWaa	I wanted to point out something, a bit outside of what the others have mentioned.   You will likely get help from the officers first and then, depending on how unsafe your driving was, the conditions, etc., you may or may not still get a ticket.<br>  <br>  Just make sure, however, that you do pull over immediately, and that you stay in your vehicle and follow the officer's instructions as normal.  Tell the officer what is happening, and then they will determine how to proceed.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are some, who perceive the situation to be worse than it is and either never pull over, or jump out of the car flailing and screaming at an officer, who has simply no clue what's going on with them.   If the officer has to chase you, fight with you, or arrest you before he or she can even find out what the problem is, they will still help you of course, but you will most-likely  get the ticket and any other related charges.<br>  <br>  Keep your head and realize that the officer doesn't know about the baby...all they know is that they've stopped a speeder.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	"you're not"<br>  not "your not"<br>  <br>  and it is still illegal <br>  however it is very unlikely that you'll get a ticket in that situation<br>  <br>  going the speed limit will get you there faster than getting pulled over will....so that's your best bet<br>  <br>  hopefully I'll word this next part better this time:<br>  if you feel it's an emergency situation, and that you 'need' to speed<br>  call 911 and let them know which route you'll be taking<br>  they'll likely send an ambulance to intercept you and get you/your wife/anyone else to the hospital<br>  <br>  but labor is not an emergency where you saving 2 minutes on the trip is going to do anybody any good|`|b8svqAMAaa	no.. it is still against the law no matter what the excuse.  more than likely the cop would not hold you up while they wrote a ticket if you are going to the hospital but will warn you to abide by the law.  you are not excluded from the law, if you do get a ticket, take it and go about you way.|`|AA11376640	I wouldn't care if it was legal or not, your wife/child's safety is far more important than anything a judge can do to you! Speed within reason, don't risk life and limb in the process of saving life and limb. I personally would not even stop for the police until I got to the hospital.|`|XLSfTnISaa	Not legal by any means, thats what EMS is for, but the Officer in most cases will help you get to the hospital safety via an escort.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	the cops will likely recognize the emergency and help you<br>  <br>  if you think you need to speed you should call an ambulance<br>  <br>  keep in mind if you cause an accident while speeding, regardless of reason, the insurance companies will not likely be as lenient as the cops|`|AA11828439	There is NEVER a justification, even in what you consider to be an emergency. The suggestion that the Police will escort you is bunk. Causing an accident on the way to the hospital doesn't serve any purpose, and "Water breaking" is not an emergency. It will likely be several HOURS before the birth.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	I drove my wife to the hospital when her water broke.  It was about a twenty minute drive at the speed limit.  She had the baby about six hours after we arrived at the hospital.  Most births last hours even for women who have had a child before.  There is no real need to speed if your wife goes into labor.  Besides I would not want to be responsible for crashing and killing my wife and soon to be new born child.<br>  <br>  I would not write you a ticket for something like this since it is a big day but I would tell you to slow down and if the child really is about to be born I would call an ambulance to the scene since they will be better equipped to deal with a new born who may need medical attention then either of us would be.|`|a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	No.  That is what 911 is for.<br>  <br>  Having a baby is not an emergency.  You've had nine months to get ready for the big day.  Your cell phone should be charged and ready to go!  Speeding to the hospital endangers you, your wife, unborn child and everyone on the road.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Have been in that situation as an officer. <br>  1. Escorted couple to hospital emergency room.<br>  <br>  2. Delivered one child in the back seat of a car, then waited for Ambulence to arrive and take to hospital.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	That's a good, complex situation!  I'd have to assume that the water broke while you were in the car (no opportunity to call before you got into the car).<br>  <br>  I am not a police officer, but I do have friends on the local force.  I am also a former US Navy hospitalman.<br>  <br>  The main goal is to get the patient appropriate medical care and into a safe environment to have her baby.  Most police departments have a "no escort" policy for medical emergencies due to liability concerns.  The officer that pulls over a driver with an obviously pregnant (and in labor) passenger would probably not be too concerned about writing the driver for speeding ... they should call an ambulance to transport the passenger to the hospital and give the passenger medical care within the scope of their training until the ambulance arrives.<br>  <br>  Reasons why officers do not give escort service to medical emergencies anymore:<br>  <br>  1)  The driver of the car is under stress and heavily distracted, they might get into an accident on the way to the hospital.<br>  <br>  2)  Most drivers know better than to enter an intersection when they hear a siren approaching, but will enter the intersection as soon as the patrol car clears it.  They will enter the intersection just in time to block the vehicle the patrol car was escorting.<br>  <br>  3)  A medical emergency requires care as soon as possible.  In most situations an ambulance  with medically trained personnel and equipment to render proper care can be on the scene in 10 minutes or less.  It's usually worth the 10 minute wait for properly trained and equiped personnel!<br>  <br>  4)  In addition to proper care on the way to the hospital, an ambulance provides a more stable and comfortable ride for the patient!  <br>  <br>  In this situation, I would suggest that the driver move the passenger as short a distance as possible before contacting an ambulance service ... (stop at a rest area pay phone and dial 911 if necessary!) getting the best available medical care for the patient at the first opportunity should be the first concern.  Bouncing her down the road in a speeding car should be the very last choice on the list!

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Your marriage licence/certificate will do.  By the way, try and get married BEFORE you give birth as then you will be able to make the medical decisions yourself and not defer to your parents.  Also, in the state of Illinois, being pregnant and/or giving birth are NOT grounds for emancipation.  Many people think that this is grounds for emancipation but it seldom is.  <br>  <br>  Also, are your parents consenting to your marriage?  If not, you will need a judge's consent.

Some palces may believe that you are emancipated, others will require proof.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	You will only need the proof when it comes time to rent an apartment or to enter into any kind of contract.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	It depends on several things.  If you were married to him and are now divorced, then you need either his permission or a court order for permission to take your child out-of-state.  If you were not married to him, you may still need a court order but that is more likely to be granted.  I recommend that you get a good lawyer as it will be money well spent to get past this trouble!<br>  <br>  Now as for his fitness for visitation.  If he uses drugs, he is an unfit parent.  You need to file for sole custody based on his drug use.  The courts will test him and if he tests positive for drug use, he will be lucky to get supervised visitation.  His butt could also be tossed in jail.  Also, he will be made to pay child support too.  I suspect that if you can prove his drug use (court ordered hair follicle tests will do that), the courts will give you permission to take your daughter to California.  And his troubles will be just beginning!<br>  <br>  One last thing, don't up-and-leave without a court order in place as he could then file an emergency order for custody and get you in trouble.  Do it properly!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XdGjhbfMaa	You can, but if he's against it he's likely to take you to court for visitation, which from Illinois to California is likely to be every other holiday and a good part of summer unless you can validate your claims of drugs and abuse before the judge.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	Check your court papers, if it says you cannot move without the permission of the court you must go to a lawyer and schedule a court date, if there is nothing in the papers then just go.<br>  <br>  If you have no court orders because there is no court case yet then you can go.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|F6yfJSr9aa	You should probably contact an attorney, even though I know they can be expensive.

Y5S2dDkYaa	The UK immigration policy has been, in the past few decades, quite flippant and laissez faire in the wake of such civil unrest in the world - at first immigrants from the east indies (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh) were highly prized as cheap labor to help rebuild after WWII. Then after Britain gave up most of its overseas territory, the "Commonwealth of Nations" was established, giving special provision of trade and movement for ex-crown territories such as India, Jamaica, Australia.<br>  <br>  Lately, the bulk of immigration law is focused on cultural engineering ideals such as multiculturalism and cultural pluralism - I still dont understand how this equates to importing 3 million poorly educated muslims, but thats where most immigrants come from - middle east countries (there is an allowance to war torn wrecks like Iraq, Sudan and Afganhnistan) - but now after 9/11 and the London train bombings things are getting alittle tighter - but there is still little enforcement in Britain.|`|JpuYvXg9aa	The first requirement to being in the EU is you must be in Europe... <br>  <br>  So thats never gonna happen.|`|oQfCTx9saa	The uk needs to get contro of the borders and stop letting the  gypsies of europs aka the poles from coming here they just a country of scroungers.

I doubt there is even any case pending, the birth certificate is proof of his birth in the US.<br>  <br>  Move on.<br>  <br>  Those who have filed the suits are the ones wasting the money of the taxpayers, how is it his responsibility?<br>  <br>  A birth certificate is a government document, issued by the county clerk in the county where a person was BORN.<br>  <br>  No he has not broken his oath, give up on this stupid debate.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the U.S., the keeping of vital statistics is a state function, because it is not a power assigned by the Constitution to the federal government (under the Tenth Amendment, all powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and the people), and yet the federal government is extremely dependent upon this state function it lacks direct jurisdiction over, because the Fourteenth Amendment expressly grounds American citizenship upon birth in the United States (a jus soli system of citizenship).<br>  <br>  Therefore, the federal and state governments have traditionally cooperated, to some extent, to improve vital statistics. From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the U.S. Public Health Service. Unlike the British system of recording all births in "registers", the states file an individual document for each and every birth. In most states, this document was, and still is, entitled a "Certificate of Live Birth". [3][4]<br>  <br>  In the U.S., the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births. However, states are free to create their own forms. [5] These "forms" are completed by the attendant at birth or a hospital administrator, which are then forwarded to a local or state registrar, who stores the record and issues certified copies when requested<br>  <br>  Short forms, known sometimes as computer certifications, are not universally available, but are cheaper than photocopies and much more easily accessible. Limited information is taken from the original birth record (the long form) and stored in a database that can be accessed quickly when birth certificates are needed in a short amount of time. Whereas the long form is a copy of the actual birth certificate, a short form is a document that certifies the existence of such certificate, and is usually titled a "Certification of Birth" or "Certificate of Live Birth". The short form typically includes the child's name, date of birth, sex, and place of birth, although some also include the names of the child's parents. When the certification does include the names of the parents, it can be used in lieu of a long form birth certificate in almost all circumstances [6]. Nearly all states in the U.S. issue short forms certifications, on both state and local levels [10].|`|AA11206283	I am not a BO fan; but dear GOD I wish you people would get over this issue.<br>  <br>  He's in.<br>  <br>  Time to worry aboout bigger and tougher issues.<br>  <br>  No amount of kvetching is going to change it.|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	Obama is the  President.

It would also increase the number of school buses needed which would create more jobs in bus production, maintenance of buses and bus drivers.<br>  <br>  raise it to 18.

HseC4dZ9aa	Why Buy Organic?<br>  Food the way Mother Nature made it is clean and wholesome. Your body knows just what to do with it. After all, it has had an awfully long time to figure that out.<br>  <br>  Organic food doesn’t contain toxins like pesticides, heavy metals, dangerous industrial chemicals (for example, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives). And everything in it is natural: it’s real food, not "Frankenfood" created in a laboratory for profit regardless of the fact that genetically modified, synthetic foods have massive, well-known health hazards.<br>  <br>  Every item on this site is free of the dangers inherent in the industrial food supply.<br>  <br>  What Happens If I Eat Dumb, Dangerous Food?<br>  Dumb, dangerous food is laced with toxic industrial chemicals and additives because of the way it is grown, packaged, produced and manufactured. Its nutrient density (the amount of good stuff you get in the food you eat) is much lower than organic food while all of those industrial toxins act as poisons to the enzyme systems which life depends upon.<br>  <br>  After all, we as a species have only encountered the 100,000+ chemicals added to toxic food and our toxic environment in the last seventy years or so. Our cells and bodies are used to real food: we don’t know what to do, biochemicaly speaking, with dumb food so we are poisoned by it. That’s why it’s dangerous.<br>  <br>  And if the food has had its genetic make-up contaminated by scientists who have messed up the DNA of food with viruses, non-food genes, insect and human genetic bits and so on, our bodies have no way at all to deal with this dangerous stuff. This messed-up, dumb food made by smart–but not very wise–scientists working for rich — but not very responsible — companies, is called Genetically Modified Organism or GMO food. Sometimes it’s called Genetically Engineered (GE) or Biotechnical Modified (BM) food.<br>  <br>  Whatever you call it, studies show that eating it is associated with slow, gradual organ system failure, perforated, bleeding guts, shrunken kidneys, damaged immune systems, increased serious and life threatening diseases like cancer, autoimmune disease, life threatening allergies, irregularities in the blood system, and a host of other dangerous, and deadly conditions.<br>  <br>  And here is the dumbest part of all: this dumb and dangerous "food" does not have to be tested for safety before it is released into the food supply. It just has to have a patent on it. And patents do not take safety into account.<br>  <br>  So what happens if you eat dumb and dangerous food? Nothing good and perhaps some really, really bad things. The US is the only country which does not require labeling of GMO food. So lots of the foods you eat everyday probably contain dangerous, dumb food including non-organic corn, soy,canola oil and many nutritional supplements!<br>  <br>  <br>  GMO Health Impact!!!!!

This regulatory set of mandates became known as Codex Alimentarius and was effectively implemented until the fall of the empire in 1918. The United Nations (UN) met in 1962 and decided that Codex should be re-implemented worldwide in order to protect health of the consumers. Two-thirds of funding for Codex emanates from the FAO while the other third comes from the WHO.<br>  <br>  In 2002, the FAO and WHO had serious concerns about the direction of Codex and hired an external consultant to determine its performance since 1962 and to designate which direction to take the trade organization [2]. The consultant concluded that Codex should be immediately scrapped and eliminated. It was at this time that big industry realized the full monetary potential of this organization and exerted its powerful influence. The updated outcome was a toned down report asking Codex to address 20 various concerns within the organization.<br>  <br>  Since 2002, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has covertly surrendered its role as an international public health and consumer protection organization. Under the helm of big industry, the sole surreptitious purpose of the new codex is to increase profits for the global corporate juggernauts while controlling the world through food. The implicit understanding of their philosophy is that if you control food, you control the world.<br>  <br>  Codex Now<br>  <br>  The most dominant country behind the agenda of Codex is the United States whose sole purpose is to benefit multinational interests like Big Pharma, Big Agribusiness, Big Chema and the like. At the latest meeting in Geneva, the U.S. recently became the chair of Codex which will

kZT828wJaa	Obviously many criminals, especially the more violent ones, aren't literally 'cowards'. Its one of those emotional insults that families or courts throw out there because they want to deride the honor of criminals. Its like calling someone a b*tch or *sshole, its obviously not literally true, its just an angry response to insult them.<br>  <br>  Its like when folks accuse Hitler of being a coward. He fought in the trenches of World War I where he was wounded, won the Iron Cross for bravery, went on to rebuild Germany in the face of economic and political crisis, waged war against most of the worlds other major powers, and then chose to stand his ground and shot himself rather than flee Germany. Of all the things you could say about Hitler, cowardice is not one of his attributes. Its just an emotional response.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	Most of the people who commit crimes are cowards.<br>  <br>  Anytime someone shoots someone, front or back, if the person is not shooting at them, they are a coward.<br>  <br>  A coward will never look a victim in the eye, they are afraid of what they might see.<br>  <br>  Maybe if they "eye the relatives" they are actually a bully, but a bully is a coward, that is afraid to have a evenly matched confrontation, and tries to intimidate the victim.<br>  <br>  Why, did someone call you a coward?  Why do you want to stand up for them?<br>  <br>  Prosecutors use this type of language because they feel the evidence is not strong enough to stand alone, and without using language that conveys emotion, they might loose the case.<br>  <br>  I think that the prosecution should not be making these kind of statements in any argument to the jury because it is a blatant attempt to influence a jury with something other than the evidence, and should not be permitted.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GHPZlhAwaa	Well, criminals believe that they deserve anything that they want and if they have to take it from someone who has worked hard to get it, then that is just to bad.

That is cowardly.<br>  <br>  whale|`|46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	It is believed by many that one deviates from the laws that govern a civilized society out of a weakness or moral cowardice that exists independently of the rationale for the crime itself.  Socrates, for example, was noted for emphasizing obedience of the laws of one's homeland as the act of the good and righteous individual.<br>  <br>  In my view, a case-by-case view is appropriate when viewing a criminal.  For example, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were famous for engaging in acts of civil disobedience through which they broke laws they perceived to be unjust so as to call attention to the need to change them.  These men are hardly labeled cowards.  To the contrary, their bravery is properly recognized worldwide.<br>  <br>  When one commits a crime, one's motive is important in determining whether one can rightly be accused of cowardice.  Some may have been cowards.  Others may have not.  A blanket statement that any criminal is, as a rule, a coward is prejudicial oversimplification.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Ditto to the top responder. It has nothing to do with how they did it. It's that they are weak, pathetic, and not man/woman enough to handle their problems like normal people, so they take the easy way out.|`|sf7lOcIiaa	They are cowards because they committed the crime, not how they did it.

We can digitally add some Muppets, too!|`|1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	He is one of the only GOP members who cannot be connected to the Bush administration in the manner GOP Congressmen can.  That would be my guestimation on the reason he made the response speech last night.  Since he is a Governor he could not be blasted for voting for any of the Bush policies.  It is as obvious as the nose on my face that he is precampaigning and I suppose as the GOP goes, he would be as good of a candidate as they have to offer.  His one big boo-boo in his response speech tho', was mentioning Katrina.  Someone gave him bad advice on that one.|`|AA11702773	I think he is precampaigning but from the identity of his supporters I think he is repackaged neocon-ism.  However, I am not sure of that, and would look into it by 2012.<br>  <br>  I prefer Ron Paul, but don't know that he will be running.<br>  <br>  I agree w/ someone else that he said he won't run in 2012.  If Obama is strong in 2012, the younger GOP raising stars will likely use the luxury of sitting it out, rather than risk wasting their best shot.  If Obama crashes and burns, of course, they can always change their minds.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	Poor guy, he combined, somehow, the worst of Mr. Rogers, GWBush, Oscar the Grinch, Rush Limbaugh and Charles the Kraut Hammer.

I thought Palin was bad, but she's a valedicktakerin compared to him.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Of course.  That is why he stated he will refuse a portion of the stimulus money that goes to his state.  <br>  <br>  Again, instead of being pragmatic, a Republican is being ideological.

Do I think that he can beat Obama today?  No but neither can Palin...  the GOP has to go center and Jindal is a wise bet to groom him for 2012.<br>  <br>  If the GOP wants to win the presidency in 2012 they have to pray that Obama fails but that won't be enough.  They also need to appear moderate and Jindal is a good sign of them understanding that.|`|k6hicodfaa	He absolutely is.  He needs to get out step with the fallacies of the current GOP rhetoric and help re-energize the thought and campaigns in a way that reaches minorities, women, and the educated elite that were alienated less than a year ago.|`|reeU4N0eaa	Are you libs so concerned about Jindals reply (I mean who ever really watches those things) because you finally heard a speech were substance mattered more than style?<br>  <br>  When you finally realize that a pretty face does not a message make, you'll see Obama says absolutely nothing.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	OK, <br>  I knew about Jindal well over a year ago.<br>  Same with Palin (at least 2 years with her).  I guess I follow politics and read. <br>  <br>  Last night's speech wasn't his best, but he has done better....and he can improve on his speaking style.<br>  <br>  BO can't change who he is at a core level.|`|AA10152346	The word good reached a new lower standard when Palin was asked to be the VP candidate.<br>  <br>  So if in Rep talk Jindal means good I guess he is then.|`|27sSI5wxaa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  Then Obama will definitely be assured a second term.|`|1NO10YfPaa	Sure would 'cause I want the Republicans to lose!!!|`|HZy629kLaa	Maybe.  But even republicans thought his speech last night was bad.  Doesn't look good for him.|`|AA11042590	No, he's a rare blend of a hindu and redneck. A goldmine for Saturday Night Live. He speaks as if he were in the 5th grade and look disturbingly odd. He looks like Brad Pitt's retarded brother Arm Pitt. You might want to get the rich mormon to run again, or even the ditsy broad that was too busy spying on Russian leaders from her from her window to pay any attention to her daughter getting pounded like cake in the basement. How about the cross dressing ex mayor of NY, he'll probably be done with his 7th marriage by then. Or even rolling old McCain back to make more incoherent speeches, by then he should be in a wheel chair. Let's see who else the republicans can turn to. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, how about digging up Reagan's corpse, and propping him up like Weekend at Bernie's, hell he can't do any worse than W.|`|lzsyNKBzaa	I believe he would make an excellent choice.

So yes hes a great choice.|`|VMuZYfMwaa	No. He is not a natural born citizen of the United States (where is his birth certificate??), and he supports terrorists (see my source at the bottom!)|`|gQYIphZtaa	I sure hope they nominate him or Sarah Palin.

Many times.<br>  <br>  Understanding the Constitution requires more than reading the Constitution, though.  Reading the letters of the founders helps us understand the context in which the Constitution was written.  Reading opinions of the Supreme Court helps us understand the interpretations over the years.<br>  <br>  It is a wonderful document that continues to serve us well.  The framers appear to have understood well that human, flaws and all, would be entrusted to implement the provisions of the Constitution.  Thus we have imperfections.

By ticketing the Samaritan, the police are merely establishing the illegal activities, so a court can determine the % of liability each party is responsible for. <br>  When (not if) the Samaritan sues for damages, without a citation the burden of proof will be upon the driver that hit him to prove he was crossing the road illegally.

Of course the liberal media doesn't report it because they like to downplay terrorism.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but if you know anything about economics and government you would understand that this crisis did not happen because of the money we spent on the war, it happened because Clinton made massive provisions to the community reinvestment act in 1995 which mandated that banks give out subprime loans because people with bad credit couldn't get loans to buy homes.

That after eight years and ELEVEN POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS of debt left by bush, NOW they want to talk money.<br>  <br>  HAR!<br>  **********************************<br>  Cost of the Bush era: $11.5 trillion<br>  The outgoing administration has presided over 8 years of disasters and crises with some of the biggest price tags the nation has ever seen.<br>  By John Dyer, MSN Money <br>  George W. Bush's presidency cost the country about $11.5 trillion, if we estimate liberally.<br>  Of course, it's debatable how much blame the president should bear.<br>   $150 billion surplus disappears<br>  Over the past eight years, we've suffered calamities that were bound to damage the nation deeply: two recessions, the most lethal terrorist attacks ever on U.S. soil, the invasion of Iraq on dubious grounds, the near destruction of one of our most storied cities and, finally, the Wall Street meltdown.<br>   Quiz: What cost the most?<br>  Because the median U.S. household income is about $50,000, readers may have trouble grasping the concept of spending trillions.<br>  For context, let's compare two cases of extraordinary spending under Bush.<br>  After the Sept. 11 attacks, Washington pledged $22 billion to help rebuild in lower Manhattan. At the time, that sum sounded enormous. It was more than one-fourth of the $80 billion budget that New York state had adopted a month before. Though some called for even more aid, the country at large was satisfied that this response was adequate to cope with calamity on a colossal scale.<br>  Oh, how far we've come.<br>  In early October of 2008, Congress appropriated $700 billion to rescue Wall Street's financial institutions. Once that was done, the sky was the limit, and the numbers became dizzying.<br>  And the spending won't stop after Bush leaves office Jan. 20.<br>   Debt for future generations<br>  In hopes of "breaking the momentum" of the current recession, President-elect Barack Obama is reportedly drafting a stimulus package that would cost the government as much $850 billion. If past is precedent, it's unlikely Obama will stop there.<br>  Talk back: Where should we cut future U.S. spending?<br>  The new administration is already expected to inherit a $1.2 trillion deficit from Bush. The stimulus package would add to that record-breaking number.<br>  Picture an avalanche of cash disappearing into the Potomac.<br>  Where has all the money gone? Here are five areas where Bush has approved massive outlays of taxpayer money.<br>  Wall Street bailouts: $6 trillion<br>  When the real-estate bubble burst, Wall Street collapsed, too. Starting with Bear Stearns in March, investment banks fell like dominoes, done in by overexposure to mortgage-backed securities. We're still sifting through the damage. But we know U.S. taxpayers are among the biggest losers.<br>  In hopes of stanching the bleeding, the federal government has spent or put at risk approximately $6 trillion. True, a big part of that number reflects the government's purchase of securities that may actually yield a profit one day. Critics of this enormous commitment will point out that it has yet to produce any solid evidence of a turnaround in the economy's slide, while the Bush administration's apologists argue that, without such a commitment, the news would have been much worse.<br>  The best-known aspect of this epic spending spree is the U.S. Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, whose remit has included purchasing so-called toxic securities, giving banks cash and helping Detroit automakers avoid bankruptcy.<br>  But TARP, as the program is known, is just the tip of the iceberg.<br>  The Treasury also gave $300 billion in guarantees for struggling Citigroup, poured $200 billion into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when officials seized the mortgage giants to prevent their bankruptcy, and granted an additional $50 billion in temporary guarantees to keep investors from pulling out of money market funds. Again, a guarantee doesn't necessarily mean the Treasury will actually spend the money. But that money is at risk, and that's taxpayer money.<br>  The Federal Reserve has also been busy. Central bankers have said they could purchase as much as $1.3 trillion of commercial paper from nonfinancial companies to make sure businesses have the working capital they need in an environment where banks are hesitant to lend. The Fed has committed an additional $1 trillion to a variety of credit facilities designed to encourage banks to loosen up, from outright loans to banks, to purchases of securities backed by consumer credit, to $600 billion to buy securities backed by prime mortgages -- a move that knocked standard home loan rates down to 5%. <br>  And there's more.<br>  Among other federal rescue measures we have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s decision to guarantee as much as $1.4 trillion in interbank loans, $300 billion for the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages in danger of foreclosure and a $150 billion aid package for insurance giant American International Group.<br>  A lot of the guarantees that have been made will never come into play; just making a guarantee usually does the trick, if it's the Federal Reserve speaking. Here is some more good news: Some of the government's crisis-related investments may actually prove profitable. Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, believes the government could see a profit of $500 billion from stock dividends and the appreciation of stocks.

Then if, when, he falls short his follows are so vocal giv ehim time, he's doing a great job, it's the past persons faults, excuses and double standards and like one person who is a loud voice for obama says he will bring this country back to it's greatness in no time flat. then when obama falls short this same persons says. we'll gee did you think he could perform magic or something. gooly gee give the man a break..so stupid! Followers can ruin their own idol just from opening their mouths!|`|7708f35ffa2cf7f984891812e17158beaa	Wow, another instant gratification junkie.  His cabinet is not even filled in yet.  He's the president, he's not a magician, and no magician could get this crap turned around in 30 days.|`|RhDPB70Baa	Change is what's left of your paycheck after Obama gets done with it, and you can Hope that he looses in 2012.|`|jk0td5mPaa	Hell yeah...!!!!|`|5rXzu0IWaa	He gave me up to a 4500 dollar and no less than a 1060 dollar tax cut. Along with everybody else. He said he will raise taxes on those making more than 250k some day, but has not yet. So not sure what you are talking about at this point?|`|dfo8gSaraa	I cannot answer you honestly because I cant say if it's a good thing or not.<br>  I personally am going to give Obama a chance BEFORE judging him.

Who has a better plan?|`|AA10922449	I'm sad that the Bush administration ruined our economy.|`|AhH4r4eBaa	You're ticking me off because you expect things to happen IMMEDIATELY, when in reality, the problems that Bush left will take YEARS to solve.  The stock market isn't controlled by the president, and the taxes are only for the wealthy (5% of the population).  His spending is on ventures that will help the economy, provide new jobs, and help healthcare.  By spending this money, the economy will eventually improve and then the stock market will gradually go up.  But most of the effects of his changes will not be felt for a while because this will take TIME.|`|VgOCLskYaa	His policies will not affect 99% of his supporters they will continue to collect the government check once a month get tax refunds even though they do not pay taxes and it is for sure they do not have any investments and if they did get a home loan the tax payers will soon be paying the mortgage. They live the same year after year president after president so why should they be concerned with anything Buckwheat does|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	He will keep blaming the past administration as an excuse to spend us into oblivion.<br>  <br>  Now you are going to get the stupid answers like "give him a chance".

It ticks me off!|`|4nmLPk44aa	When this administration is done, it will well surpass GWB 11 trillion, by no doubt 100 zillion!!!|`|3tuwWidiaa	What new taxes?  I've yet to see any new taxes.  Have you?|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Yes, I'm relatively happy.  You are assuming that there is anything Obama could've done in his first month of office that would've simply made the problems go away.  Why do you think Obama has magical powers?  Why do you think that Obama issuing an executive order has the power the change the entire economy?  You're not really being serious, are you?<br>  <br>  Edit:  If someone disagrees with you, you cannot simply ascribe that disagreement to ignorance or stupidity.  You must be willing to at least consider that you are wrong and your opponent is right.  Otherwise, you're not having a conversation - you're just yelling.
D5A9JUDMaa	They LAUGH themselves to sleep at night.<br>  <br>  <br>  Today's politicians are CROOKED as can be, and the STUPID DEMOCRAT voters keep RE-electing them.<br>  <br>  WITH YOUR VOTES, you are saying you support what they have done, and what they continue to do.<br>  <br>  WHY WOULDN'T people like Barny Frank, Hilliary/Bill Clinton, Barack, Chris Dodd, John Kerry..... keep sucking on the teat of corruption?

She is totally brainwashed however that this is the worst the country has ever been.|`|RhDPB70Baa	That's what people want.

s1LfdCdsaa	You have to keep in mind who got him elected. Yes, welfare for illegals should be eliminated, as should welfare for those perfectly capable but equally unwilling to work for a living. However, with regard to the latter, you have Obama's voting base, a group who may have collectively cast their first vote in a Presidential election last November, who voted for Obama not only because he was "one of their own" but because they think that his election guarantees that they won't have to get jobs.<br>  <br>  Yes, eliminating opportunity here, both to get jobs and go on the dole, would go a long way towards encouraging third world illegals to go back to where they belong.|`|31CUQuKNaa	thought he did, poorest are getting biggest tax break, i know for my kids that's about 600 a yr more in there pockets. if its not helping u then your must be in top 2percent of the richest people in usa. or another republican or clinton fan who is looking for someone to blame|`|8QWr77YZaa	Wow, I can't believe I am responding.  Please don't report this as abuse, I am trying to help you understand your own country and the president you most likely elected.<br>  <br>  Obama is throwing money at the US economy right now like never ever seen before.  People made fun of Bush for  throwing money at Iraq.. ironic eh?  The point is we spent over 1 trillion dollars last year and already working on another trill by end of February.  2 trillion dollars spent with a 10 trillion dollar debt that is a 20% of our debt we just added to it.  Where can he possibly find money for tax cuts?  Where do you think that 820 Billion $ stimulus plan came from?  That is OUR TAX MONEY.<br>  <br>  Cut out all welfare to illegal immigrants and let them return home...  This country was founded upon immigration and not all of it was legal.  We would hurt ourselves more than help if we did that.  And illegal immigrant welfare is only a small problem as of now but it is growing.  The problem is they do not pay taxes.  California is the worst off in this case.  They are 40b in debt and growing due to illegal immigrant welfare.  There are ways to go about this, to force citizenship and registration.  <br>  <br>  We the people and the government are making mistake after mistake while mistakes from the past are now haunting us.  Social Securities, Investment Banking, Federal Aid.  And after all this time of thinking about how to solve it, knowing these problems would inevitably arise what does Obama do?  He throws money at it.|`|KktkViZ4aa	excellent question,one that i think a lot of people would like to know. i just think obama is on a roll,pray he won't start rocking.|`|xw13XqNaaa	Yeah, he should give all Republicans one big tax cut especially those that work in the finance industry.  They are the ones that deserve it.  Is that the answer you were looking for?|`|RhDPB70Baa	Because people don't want to be able to choose what to do with their money, they want their money taken from them and used for things their god-king tells them is good.|`|i9V7t3pRaa	Because only Obama can save us from ourselves.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	Because if you get to keep your own money and fend for yourself, the government can't control your life.

I think the American authorities want to make an example of this "cyber terrorist" as they see him and send him to jail for 60 years or something like that. In my opinion Gary McKinnon is just a strange man with an obsessive interest in UFOs. He was so convinced that the US is hiding evidence on alien visitations that he hacked into US security service computers to try and prove it.

AcWMpmPwaa	infanticide and abortion are totally separate issues. the former is akin to genocide on already live(out of the womb)infants where the latter is pre-birth. we already know where obama stands on roe v. wade. he does have a history of voting on certain aspects of exactly when the baby is aborted which has been a sticking point of the pro-choice crowd for a long time(mainly because if we start changing the when and how aspect they think the move will be put on to repeal). great right wing guy has part of it right, he has voted to basically let a mis-abortion sit there until it dies(as a matter of fact, there was a news segment not to long ago of a young girl very happy to have beat those odds )and his votes are also more concerned with addendum's that weren't supported to get the bills passed. there's a lot of websites out there that support all of this and the left as shown here today will fight to the death for this and their man.<br>  <br>  that's what i like about you winona...always on top of things!!!<br>  you go girl!!!|`|1NO10YfPaa	A fetus is not a baby.

Why the hypocrisy?<br>  <br>  And Vitter wants him to go?  The guy who had his number on the DC madam's speed dial because he frequented prostitutes so often?  When is Senator Vitter of Louisiana going to go?  Blago was impeached for trading favors for a seat?  <br>  <br>  The Republican Governor before him is sitting in jail now for stuffing cash bribes in his pocket in exchange for commercial drivers' licenses and he got to serve his entire term before he went to jail.  People died in that scheme, Illinois faced huge lawsuits and Patrick Fitzgerald (R) held off the indictment until after old Georgie Ryan (R) was out of office.  Ted Stevens (R) of Alaska was convicted of taking bribes and he didn't get thrown out, he was still wandering around the Senate.  What is with you people?  Why are Dems held to a higher standard?|`|3caq6SFxaa	Like Gov Blago I am sure that Senator Burris really believes he did nothing wrong and will not resign-the thought they both think they did nothing wrong is worrisome in itself.

They didn't and it is not Senator Burris that really is making them look bad it is the inability to stick to the first decision they made.|`|gdYN39gtaa	I guess he's no worse than the other tax evaders and worse<br>     that Obama has picked for his personal cabinet.

You should contact your local dhs office and it depends on how much you make and be prepared its a long and grueling process I used to work at a social service agency that helped people apply for all these benefits also you have to show proof of everything and they take into consideration liquid assets as well.Please look at the links also you can also check out the local food pantries that are located at local churches.

936c388de0ff29285515b23ab6318ffeaa	How is it taking responsibility to charge and tax more the people who are working to cover benefits for people who aren't/won't/can't?  How is it taking responsibility to charge and tax more the people who are working to cover the fault of people who didn't, couldn't and won't pay their bills?  How is it taking responsibility to charge and tax more the people who are better at taking care of and are responsible with their money to cover the bills of those who can't/won't/don't?<br>   <br>  Give everyone equal taxes and equal benefits for the same price.  If people in the lower bracket gets $0.20 to the dollar on deductions then make that for every bracket.  If the lower tax bracket can get a government supported benefit for $100 /month then all tax brackets should be able to get equal benefits for the the same price.<br>  <br>  Don't give people health insurance, but set up a basic insurance that people (anyone) can buy and use no matter their age, gender, income that is reasonable in price and is equal.  This way those that are using it are giving something towards it, and money isn't being wasted on those who aren't using it.  <br>  <br>  Stop giving free handouts.  If people want/need assistance then fine help them, but don't give it to them for free.  This will cut down on those abusing the system for a free ride.  Those that really need it will be willing to put forth effort.<br>  <br>  I have no issues with it being worse before it's better -- this didn't happen over night, but make it equal and fair to everyone no matter their class, race, gender, income, marriage status, etc.<br>  <br>  Responsibility is spending within your budget.  It is also learning to save for what/need you want, and work for what you want/need.  It's paying your own bills and debts, and not expect handouts or that you are entitled to the government (tax payers) picking up the bill.<br>  <br>  I have been both with and without health insurance growing up.  I have been both middle and lower tax bracket in my life.  I have struggled and worked for things I have wanted and needed.  I have received government assistance to help with my college. I have been raised that if I make a debt it is my responsibility to repay it.  I know that if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you will feed a village (If you fix a man's issues you teach him nothing, but if you teach a man to be responsible and give him the tools and knowledge on how to it will help the entire country and not just himself).|`|f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	He is taking the responsibility as we read this article.<br>  <br>  He loves big government and conservatives are in the minority.

Who said there are only two sides to an issue, and who will monitor thoughts. What if I'm an Independent.|`|AA11248330	It's amazing how right-wing trolls and their hosts love to pontificate, isn't it? Unfortunately for them, they only prove my points. One of them offers: "...MSNBC, CNN are losing their audience in greater numbers, while Fox, Hannity or Rush Limbaugh numbers are increasing. ..." Unfortunately, the argument is not only lacking in facts, but illustrates why the Fairness Doctrine is important. For instance, Fox "News" ranted on, as did Rush and Ken doll Sean, about WMDs in Iraq, as well as every other lie put forth by the Bush administration, reaching millions of listeners and viewers, while also slandering the U.N. weapons inspectors, who just happened to be right. If you add political Christian broadcasting to this toxic mix, you get a monopoly that is dangerous. Progressives didn't get on Armed Forces radio until late in 2005, but even then Ed Schultz was threatened with cancellation before he even debuted, because he criticized someone in the Bush administration. This isn't championing free speech. It is patently unfair practice. It also illustrates the tilted news our military is getting. That, too, is dangerous. <br>  <br>  Right-wing radio offers propaganda, not facts, with the intent to play on the listeners emotions, without offering content that is based in reality. The ratings prove that FNC, Fox "News" channel is losing out in the ratings. In addition, the ignorance of conservatives about media and radio is further shown when they say the Fairness Doctrine is about "...demanding that the government implement further control or regulation over an entire industry, it might be simpler to look in the mirror, at the rating points & ad revenues & realize that the market for the “progressive” or liberal slant isn’t as popular or pervasive as you assume it to be. ... Again, they miss the point. Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller, as well as the leader in progressive talk, Randi Rhodes, are making it in the commercial market. They are not only popular, but growing. The issue is to allow more progressive hosts on local am/fm radio to see if we can also make it. Unless you've been in the battle for radio you don't know what it's like, with conservative corporations not even giving progressives a chance to get on air, or cancelling good hosts before they have the time to prove themselves. You have to give progressive hosts a chance to build an audience, which takes time. But conservatives do not want fairness, which can be seen through their trade policy, as well as their anti-union rhetoric, which has decimated the middle class, by selling out workers for outsourcing all in the name of profit. They want a one-way talking machine on radio, paid by and benefiting only their political partners in business, as well. <br>  Right-wing is on the air and getting advertisers because they're the only game in town, except for a few progressive hosts like Schultz, Miller and Rhodes. The Fairness Doctrine will not keep a bad show on, but it will allow entry to good hosts who are now being shut out by conservative conglomerates<br>  The short version of the Fairness Doctrine is that in 1987 Reagan had it scuttled. Shortly after that Rush Limbaugh began his journey and right-wing radio was created and gradually took over the airwaves, with the help of their corporate friends. The Fairness Doctrine could really make a difference. Why do you think conservatives are screaming like crazy?|`|FKDv6ycbaa	havent you noticed? you already cant have much of an opinion here unless you drink the obama kool-aid.|`|BxQEFUwIaa	well if not right away, im sure it will eventually

Bush on December 20, 2006,[1] is a U.S. law that broadens the provisions of previous U.S. law addressing the unauthorized wear, manufacture, sale or claim (either written or verbal) of any military decorations and medals. It is a federal misdemeanor offense, which carries a punishment of imprisonment for not more than 1 year and/or a fine; the scope previously covered only the Medal of Honor.<br>  <br>  The Act was first introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on July 19, 2005 by Representative John Salazar, a Democrat from Colorado, as H.R. 3352.[2][3] It was introduced into the Senate by Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, on November 10, 2005 as S. 1998.[4][5] The Senate version was passed unanimously on September 7, 2006.[5][6] The Senate version then went to the same House Judiciary Committee that held the House version. The Act briefly stalled, but the House subsequently passed the Senate version, S. 1998, on December 6, 2006.[7]<br>  <br>  The purpose of the Act is to strengthen the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 704 by broadening its scope and strengthening penalties. Specific new provisions in the Act include: granting more authority to Federal law enforcement officers, extending scope beyond the Medal of Honor, broadening the law to cover false claims whereas previously an overt act had to be committed, covering mailing and shipping of medals, and protecting the reputation and meaning of military heroism medals.[3][5] Under the act, it is illegal to wear, buy, sell, barter, trade or manufacture "any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the armed forces of the United States, or any of the service medals or badges awarded to the members of such forces." In the 18 months after the act was enacted, the Chicago Tribune estimates 20 prosecutions. The number is increasing as awareness about the law spreads. [8]<br>  <br>  The need for the Act came about because of large numbers of fake military heroes in the United States. For example, as of June 2, 2006 there were only 120 living Medal of Honor recipients, but there were far more known imposters.[9][10][11] There are also large numbers of fake Navy SEALS[12][13] and Army Special Forces,[14] among others.<br>  <br>  The Orders and Medals Society of America (OMSA), an organization of collectors, had opposed the bill in its current form. OMSA is of the opinion that the changes to 18 U.S.C. § 704 included wording that implied that any movement or exchange of medals would be illega<br>  <br>  SSG 74D3O|`|dVQdswtTaa	I'll assume you're a Brit, since the "Old Contempibles were an organization for WW1 British vets. <br>  <br>  If British custom allows for wear on the right to honor a deceased vet, then by all means wear them and make it clear to all who ask that these were earned by grandad in the "Great War". The old vet would probably feel honored. <br>  <br>  There is a big difference between false claims of service, and a loving grand daughter wanting to honor her Soldier grandad. There is probably a veteran's association somewhere near you. I would bet that if you explained your idea to them, they would be proud to help you honor your grand father. <br>  <br>  I would be honored if my grand kids wanted to display my uniform after I'm gone.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Yes, but you have to wear them on the right side to show you were not the actual recipient of them.|`|AA11676794	One should not wear the honors of another in the traditional fashion (on the chest).

I've read through it a few times, must have missed it.  Dang.  <br>  <br>  Apparently though, it's not within a woman's "rights" to choose not to have meaningless, unprotected sex if she's not ready to be a parent.  We're not about stripping rights, sweetie, we're about taking responsibility for our own actions.  Sorry, but something like 98% or more of all abortions are out of "convenience" and not out of saving the life of the mother or helping rape victims.  The woman just plain doesn't have time in her life for a baby right then...which means she probably should have thought about that before she got pregnant.<br>  <br>  We're really more for personal responsibility than personal freedoms.  Freedom doesn't mean anarchy - it doesn't mean do whatever the heck you want to just because you can - it means having the ability and responsibility necessary to govern yourself.  That's what our country and government were based on, and that's what republicans stand for.<br>  <br>  Why is it that democrats are "supposedly" for helping out the common people...yet only listen to the people that back up their agenda and allow them to spend whatever they want to?  I'm middle class, certainly not rich, yet am making my own way and not asking for help from Uncle Sam.<br>  <br>  Why should I have to pay for those who can't bother to do the same thing?

Does she have a choice to run down main street without any cloths on?  No.  Why not?  because society puts limits on everyone's choice.

In which case they call it lack of personal responsibility.  Or sinning.<br>  <br>  Us liberals are just as hypocritical about some things.  But, on this specific topic, I've yet to find a republican that's fully for personal freedom.<br>  <br>  Now, libertarians... they're for personal freedom!|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Because they're liars.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	The only thing that would ease my mind would be if Democrats would stop trying to raid the treasury in general. The very fact that we are even debating a plan like this is just another example of how far we have fallen in the area of personal responsibility in this country. I do not support bailing out lenders who made bad choices and likewise do not support homeowners who also made bad choices. I do have sympathy for people who are losing their homes through circumstances not of their making (illness, layoff, etc.), but it is not my burden to carry. If I were to lose my position and faced losing my home then that is what would most likely happen. Frankly it would probably mean that even with government help I still would not be able to meet the mortgage payments and would find myself in the same circumstances again in short order. I don't doubt that some people might be helped by a plan like this, but mark my words. In the majority of cases we will just be expensively forestalling the inevitable.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	What would "ease my mind" would be if people like you didn't characterize a difference of opinion as "insanity."

7BdOMd7Iaa	I believe that a despot has power over all aspects of the government of a state. Complete absolute authority. A despot can be someone who inherited the office as in an absolute monarchy. A dictator is also a person who assumes absolute power without hereditary ascension. While the term dictator is often used as a bad thing today it was originally a respectable title for a magistrate appointed by the Senate of the ancient Roman Republic to rule in times of emergency. A tyrant usually refers to someone who exercises absolute authority but is a cruel and harsh ruler. Basically a dictator is a despot, but a despot is not necessarily a dictator. Neither a despot nor a dictator are necessarily tyrants.

There is nothing wrong with having a gun in the home, look at the Amendments "right to bear arms" which is our CONSTITUTIONAL right as an American to have a gun in our homes.  Now what we do with our guns is totally different such as an 11 year old doing this to a woman, he is only doing what he learned on TV or video games. Now maybe there is a reason such as he was jealous of mom or maybe mom showed abuse and what not.

(And, one of them might be your  niece or nephew!)|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Way to not pay attention.<br>  <br>  The homes are not being repurchased.  They are standing empty and falling into disrepair.  And the families that are being dislocated are experiencing financial and emotional ruin that could be avoided if there were better ways to modify the terms of these loans, some of which would simply be illegal in more well-regulated economies.<br>  <br>  One of the main ways the Great Depression worsened was banks kicking farmers off of their land because of debts that could've easily been restructured.  Shouldn't we maybe start learning lessons from 80 years ago?<br>  <br>  I notice a lot of people seem to just not care about their neighbors being made homeless.  I'm not a Christian, so it's not really my territory, but if you call yourself a Christian shouldn't you be against this kind of thing?  Who would Jesus want to be homeless?|`|noo8vpvzaa	Why do people allow THEMSELVES to lose their homes?...How is this now the problem of the government (taxpayer)?|`|u23sBafTaa	I agree, the way most homes look when they are repossessed , these should have never owned a home to begin with !|`|9qKAy0dlaa	Because if you do that then Al Qaida wins...|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Why not allow the banks to who controlled their own predatory practices to fail and all the other corporations who were run into the ground by unscrupulous business men?<br>  <br>  Yeah, allow people to lose their homes, but don't reward the banks who are the root problem.|`|KWa9vPVQaa	Agree, why should I be responsible for someone who bought a home they cannot afford!!!! that is not the AMERICAN way!! anyone else see it this way??|`|91I5u8F9aa	what are you, 9?|`|kB7Wuyknaa	We end up paying for it in the end plus some.  When a family ends up on the street we usually end up paying for their welfare, food stamps and health care.  When a family loses their home, they don't pay property taxes then the schools, cities, states and counties and ultimately washington loses money.  Which in the end means higher taxes for us too.  Then the banks end up losing money which is one of the reasons why they need "help" right now.  It's a vicious circle that no one wins in the end.|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	I think the government should let home prices go lower, since they are too over priced.  With these prices, and considering the fact that too many people have lost their jobs and so many people have received pay cuts, not too many people are able to afford to buy homes.<br>  <br>  The prices of homes should not be kept high artificially.|`|SJTD3Ocxaa	In some cases I agree, but it's not cut and dry.....<br>  what about the guy who lost his job, has no insurance, has to pay medical bills for a sick kid and THEN can't pay his mortgage....then what?

Unfortunately, law isn't fun to practice anymore.  Designing your own laws under the guise of "change" is.  Furthermore, we're embarking on a new ideology.  The change is to punish those who've played by the rules and incent others to miss behave.  The end goal here is to be as imprudent with the inherrant challenges that are faced in a capitalist society in efforts to illuminate how much better an alternative social structure such as the failed socialist and communists policies throughout the world are.<br>  <br>  People in this country are now willing to forget that in a democracy we're voting on a public servant, and now realizing they can vote themselves a messiah.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	Because the subaru driving starbucks drinking tree hugging yuppie libs think it's not ok for them to be homeless.

When most of us purchased our first homes, the standards were more strict and we were educated by the mortgage broker. Now, the brokers have been telling people they can afford more than possible. The problem with that is they had a fiduciary duty to advise people as to what is unreasonable. Instead, the entire industry, bent on greed, continued to sell high risk mortgages. <br>  <br>  If all of these people lose their homes, the banks will not be able to sell them, the people will have suffered severe economic penalties and the entire economy is affected. That is why the banks are not lending money, not  just for personal loans, but business loans. When they stop lending money, the economy comes to a standstill. Believe me, you do not want all of these homes to foreclose, it will destroy your home value and many other things.<br>  <br>  There is actually more to it, but that was the short version.
ED433Q6Yaa	it is the culture in which they are raised. and if you had been raised on a full entitlement program, it is what you come to expect.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	I don't know anyone who does, frankly.  Can you please give specifics?|`|f624b66aaed0290aaf76eedf3378ad4caa	Well, when you have the Democrats and Obama himself spewing loudly about "spread the wealth", I can see where lazy entitlement monkeys would think this way.
5YTkGB5yaa	they can't. They just repeat what Obama says "we will not reward irresponsible homeowners" and leave it at that.<br>  But thats not possible...it's not like the government is going to say "you were responsible, but you weren't"|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	No one wants to give money to irresponsible homeowners.|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	Most of those who will benefit from the program weren't irresponsible.  They are people who took out mortgages they could finance at the time, but now cannot handle because they have lost jobs and can't find new work at the same income.  Others are losing their homes due to an illness that their insurance didn't cover adequately.<br>  <br>  Some who are bailed out will be people whose conditions are less sympathetic, and in many cases will be those who acted irresponsibly.  In practice, it's very hard to assess each individual case, and doing so would require hiring a lot of people to do the assessments.  (The same people who now complain that irresponsible home-owners are being bailed out would then complain about tax dollars being wasted on a massive bureaucracy.)<br>  <br>  As for the homeless, liberals generally do support programs to assist them.  But usually they need more basic assistance in job skills, addiction recovery, etc, before they can be ready to purchase homes.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Nobody wants to bail out irresponsible homeowners.  Too bad you didn't listen to President Obama's speech the other night, or you'd know that. <br>  Let me give you my own scenario:  my husband was making in the low six figures.  Two years ago, the small company he owned failed.  I'm a librarian, and, believe me, you don't get rich that way.  <br>  My husband worked 10-hour days, and he's been working for 40 years.  We pay our taxes, we put two kids through college, and we could easily afford the home we own.  <br>  My husband's income is now a small fraction of what he was making a few years ago.    But we are not asking for a bailout.  We worked with our bank and extended our mortgage (without increasing it) in order to cut our payments in half.  We won't live long enough to ever own our home free and clear.  It's still a struggle, but we pay our bills.  Don't you DARE call us irresponsible.  <br>  I don't want to bail out people who lived beyond their means, either.  But not everyone who's in trouble now did anything wrong.  Wait until you lose your job; you'll be singing a different tune.  <br>  All I know is, when Clinton was President, we were doing great.  If another "liberal" President could get us back to what we had 10 years ago, more power to him.    Clearly Bush didn't know what he was doing.|`|AA11450062	Well we mention the Veterans living under bridges due to the past Republican administration.|`|378838a44c6cfeeb4333c3cb60112801aa	Because nobody seems to care about the homeless. That's probably why they are homeless.|`|sND7RaMxaa	I agree with you...BUT...there are so many aspects to consider, even though the question is simple. The buck gets passed down and passed down, time after time, president to president, congress to congress, political party to political party. They don't mention the homeless, because we are in an "economic crisis"....now. New administration...new ideas all that BS. Doesn't make it right at all. <br>  <br>  I could go on and on, and I won't. There isn't enough space. Basically there are more people in very close range of loosing their homes than there are homeless people. Look it up....it's the statistic now. Which means things better turn around real quick! Lenders will need to STOP lending money for homes to people who CAN NOT afford it. And people need to be realistic as to which loan is suitable for them...<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the majority of Americans think on spending terms...not saving or investing terms. Spend, spend, spend. That's the main reason we are in this mess...and the tax payers get the bill....<br>  <br>  Oh say can you see?
Q6euzOmVaa	There will never be accurate stats on this.  if an employer admits to hiring illegal aliens they are admitting to a felony and any stat should be questioned.<br>  <br>  they could get nailed if HS was doing their job.

He is one of the few good candidates they have that will be around a while, so he's got it. Quite honestly they may have to nominate him in 2012. It would be like giving the republican party redbull.

They are more selective because they can afford to be more selective.  The Navy is probably a close second as far as toughest to get into.  The Army or the Marine Corps will definitely still take you.  There may be a limitation on what job you can choose with a DUI though.  Regardless of your past, there is always combat arms!  (unless maybe you've been convicted of a violent crime involving a firearm)<br>  I don't know anything about the Coast Guard other than, if some moron gets stuck in a hurricane, that's his problem.  I wouldn't want to go get him.|`|OE933POtaa	Air Force is the wussy branch and so is the navy, ARMY or marines will be your two best choices, but anyway, a DUI will not keep you out of the military, you can get waivers for that, but it may keep you from getting certain MOS's.

5BmnSiqUaa	Did you know that ALL the services have specialized recruiters for health service professionals?<br>  <br>  Well now you do!<br>  <br>  Due to very high demand and strict competition from civilian employers, all the Services will pay for your degree.<br>  <br>  You choose the university.<br>  <br>  They pay the tuition.<br>  <br>  You get a monthly stipend (currently $1200.00).<br>  <br>  Your service payback obligation is one-for-one. That is, if they pay for 4 years of education, you owe four years of service, if they pay for 5, you owe 5 and so on.<br>  <br>  The deal is similar for Dental School or for Medical School.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Since all the Services have medical professionals, I recommend you expand your search to include all the services.<br>  <br>  For one thing, their areas of operations vary. <br>  <br>  Have you not seen any episodes of M*A*S*H ? That's Army Medicine.<br>  <br>  Now, if you look to recent disasters, you may have seen just off to the horizon a big, white, hulking mass with a big giant red cross on it. That's either the USNS COMFORT or the USNS MERCY. These are hospital ships ran by the U.S. Navy.<br>  <br>  As the name implies, these are actual floating hospitals with operating rooms, wards, beds, doctors, dentists, nurses, technicians and laboratories. Of course, it has helicopter capabilities. And, unlike M*A*S*H units, they're away from the fighting (legally, they're immune from intentional hostile fire), they're clean, and, this is important, they're air conditioned.<br>  <br>  The Air Force will have their own unique approach to their Medical Services and it's quite possible to do your whole tour stateside. To be fair, there's ways in ALL the services to do your whole tour stateside. Those medical evacuation airplanes (where passengers'/patients' chairs all face the tail of the aircraft) are tended by the flying nurses of the U.S. Air Force.<br>  <br>  Being stateside does not preclude world travel. Opportunities always exist requiring volunteers for temporary duty (less than 180 days) overseas.<br>  <br>  That's the overview.<br>  <br>  Make contact with several Officer recruiters of all the Services.

This provides ample material for propaganda TV programmes that tell our middle classes what a magnificent job is being done by our marvellous Police.<br>  <br>  The only respect our politicians have is respect for their own inflated egos and lifestyles.

Americans.  Cleaning hotel rooms, busing tables, building houses, mowing lawns, taking care of kids.<br>  Even the Pew Hispanic Center admits, based on one of its studies, that 75 percent of construction workers are here legally, not illegal aliens.<br>  <br>  The only ones that that 10 percent of the population (probably less) helps are themselves, the employers who profit from cheap labor paid under the table, and the groups that think they can get some advantage from them such as ethnic identity groups (political power), various churches (parishoners and priests), and politicians (votes).<br>  You may have heard, for example, that U.S. household income has been stagnant for years and that income inequality is increasing as the top 1 percent controls more and more of the wealth.  Think it's any coincidence that these go along with massive immigration, both legal and illegal?  The only part of the "economy" that benefits are employers and investors.|`|Y5S2dDkYaa	Look, of course ordinary Americans did the work back then that illegals now do, and yes, WE CAN perform those jobs just fine..<br>  <br>  THIS IS AN INVASION - thank you for pointing out the obvious<br>  <br>  But I wanna point out something out too - Its not only the illegal workers causing the problem but the agri-corps and big industry that are hiring the migrants! Since the 1960's the American labor force has changed; alot of it is due to upward mobiliity; the rising middle class famillies send their kids to college - they dont wanna be tomato pickers when they grow up! So the void is created not only by lack of interest for these labor jobs but a rise in standards (or expectations) of living by the natives that make minimum wage so unattractive.<br>  <br>  In any capitalist society there will always be a need for low-end labor. All though mechanization is being expanded, the use of illegals is still an attractive option for these corporate fatcats who dont give a care about the rest of us or the future of this country because their kids trust funds are already well endowed.<br>  <br>  So, now the immigration problem, which is causing us wage inflation, school overcrowding, increased crime, overwhelemed hospitals and infrastucture - has a face. An invasion must have an invador - and the invador is undoubtedly hispanic - and the contempt arises from their inability (or outright refusal) to assimalate. Meanwhile, remissions (the sending back of money to the invadors' homeland) now account for the third biggest GDP growth industry in Mexico behind Tourism and Agriculture.<br>  <br>  We must not only demand that lower end jobs are given better compensation and working conditions, but also demand that employers stop hiring these illegals. If you keep feeding a stray cat, it will always be at your porch. When you stop feeding it, it will go home. Illegals from Mexico are much like stray cats, except the cats smell better and have less offspring. If anything is to be done, it needs to be grassroots. We must demand accountability from public officials and the corporations they serve. If not, burn these failed institutions to the ground!|`|4c21e2f4c011e6cd394d8baf6024f878aa	Americans did the jobs before we were INVADED by illegals!!!!<br>  We do not need illegals in this country!!!!

But I see an abject lack of knowledge as to how money gets spent, once it's budgeted.<br>  <br>  For starters, the Republicans (which *cough* you're not *cough*) have for DECADES ignored infrastructure improvements and upgrades of our highways, bridges, air traffic control system, mine safety, national power grid, National Parks, etc etc etc, while giving away our lumber ($1 per tree) and our public lands ($1 an acre) to loggers and miners and not regulating Wall Street, etc., which now need rescuing, instead of mere maintenance. The allocated money is spent over a period of time, in some cases 2 years, NOT a MONTH, so THAT charge of yours is bogus, fallacious, sophomoric nonsense.<br>  <br>  The helicopterS were ordered by Bush, not Obama, and at $400 million EACH, come to $11 billion for TWENTY-EIGHT 'COPTERS, NOT $12 billion for ONE.... and Obama seems more than willing to forgo their acquisition. But does that compare to McCain forcing AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER on the Navy that they don't want and didn't ask for?

There is not set amount of money to develop cures for any diseases, so you can't claim that what Obama has spent will cover the expenses.<br>     Obama isn't happy about the copter either, and there is no "welfare check" the majority of the money is being spent on helping the economy.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Actually, it was less than a week.

But why he is doing it is to save many people from losing their jobs and homes.  The man acted swiftly, and didn't drag his feet half way through the first term.<br>  <br>  And if you listened to him earlier yesterday, he did state that he was not taking the helicopter, for the one he had was just fine for him.  He is cutting a lot of spending that the Secret Service was trying to spend on him for his protection.  So one could infer that he is sacrificing his life for us to have more money.<br>  <br>  But hey - I just voted for the man, and I am sure that I will be called a "sheep" or whatever the chosen term of the day is.

Most politicians are for themselves. They do what will get them money, power, and votes. This is evident by the # of political controversies on both sides. The big difference, however, is how they go about getting these things.<br>  Although some would beg to differ, generally the democrats tend to be liberal while the republicans tend to be conservative. For all intensive purposes of this conversation, I will refer to politicians as Democrats/Liberals and Republicans/Conservatives. The varying degrees to which this is true is another debate.<br>  Republicans/Conservatives are considered to be right wing. They generally stand for lower taxes, smaller government, strong protection of free speech, gun rights, drilling for oil domestically, a strong well funded military and just overall more protection of individual rights. They are against gay marriage and abortion, and were against both the bailouts and the stimulus bill. They also tend to be more religious. The misconception of them being for the rich stems from the fact that they support tax cuts for businesses and the "rich." They also believe that welfare should be constricted more then it is currently. <br>  Democrats/Liberals are considered to be left wing. They generally stand for higher taxes when necessary, larger government, gun control, a strong focus on alternative energy, and a smaller funded military. They support abortion and gay rights as well as the stimulus package and the bailouts. The misconception of them being for the poor comes from the fact that they believe the "rich" and big businesses should have higher taxes. They also strongly support welfare.<br>  It should be noted that in the big picture, both sides are pretty close to the center of the political spectrum. They all support freedom and democracy. Unlike some, I believe all honest politicians have their heart in the right place. They do what they think is right. This idea of calling them communists or fascists is absolutely crazy. And throwing insults like saying the republicans hate the poor won't lead us anywhere good.|`|3fcfd4d7bc4f0ec25226893409bc8af5aa	Republicans: stand for the FILTHY rich, they hate minorites, and lower and middle class people.

If middle America can afford to buy clothing for their kids, then the clothing they have that is old will go to the local good will store for re-sale, thus helping those that can't afford to go to the local mall and buy stuff.<br>  <br>  It all has its benefits.  Right now, the amount of "poor" has gone way up, and due to that, those that can afford are hoarding what they have instead of donating it.  This is all a supply and demand issue - we have shrank the supply but increased the demand for this stuff.  We need to get it back to the right view.  That will mean getting money moving, get money to the local governments so they can do projects that will provide jobs to people, and then they will go out and buy things, thus moving money and providing more jobs in other sectors.<br>  <br>  Basic economics.

Records the Evidence<br>  4.  Find Evidence (grid searches, sifting, ect..)<br>  5.  Collects Evidence<br>  6  Protects the Evidence<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!  Maybe somebody who does forensics can help more.|`|RRFbDou9aa	They do the endless gruntwork of processing, photographing, and collecting evidence.|`|D4BRrUVxaa	They secure, process and collect evidence from a crime scene.
kijIJbBxaa	Rosie (even though she is a "liberal" and I'm not). I like what she had to say about 9/11 on the View and I am in complete agreement with it. <br>  <br>  9/11 was the first time fire ever melted steel and she had the guts to say it. She was simply voicing her opinion, and I thought it was despicable that some of the news media talking heads were immediately calling for her dismissal and even for her execution after she said that!! I'm sorry, but I support upholding the freedom of speech. Anyone who tries to silence dissent can go to hell as far as I'm concerned.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Anne, Rosie is a moron!|`|hiCSVwchaa	I have no idea what O'Donnell's political views are, but I can't imagine I disagree with anymore more than I disagree with Coulter.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Please, Rosie is an ignorant cow whose main strategy in a political debate is to yell "Shut up, no wants to hear your view!"|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Ann Coulter, Hands down|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Both are idiots but if forced to choose I would have to say Rosie. That dude Coulter scares the bejevvies out of me. He is a major nut job.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Ann Coulter.|`|AA10152346	Both are completely crazy|`|N5pPJUS8aa	Neither.<br>  <br>  Like most Americans, I am a Moderate, and don't lean far to either the left or the right.<br>  <br>  I do think Ann is much more hateful then Rosie, though.|`|oBviF550aa	Ann Coulter is a Rock Star!|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Rose is abrasive, rocking throwing and stupid.<br>  <br>  Ann can be abrasive, rocking throwing, but the woman is friggin' brilliant.<br>  <br>  I'd rather talk to Ann any day.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	I dont listen to either one of them.|`|AA10410008	Is that a trick question?|`|9PAavWnyaa	Ann Coulter. Rosie may be most uninformed person on the planet who likes to voice her opinion.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	I agree with both to some degree but both deliver their messages in a very harsh "in your face" way.|`|0YVDXvBOaa	Rosie is a disgusting loud mouth pig. Coulter is annoying but at least she has gathers some rational thought.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Neither...Coulter is a joke, Rosie is a comedian (almost the same).|`|17fc727d7da626634a4721e34bc49363aa	O'Donnell.  She was actually born a woman, too.|`|XxUByikJaa	Two sides on the same coin and neither are worth the time to listen to  in my opinion.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	Neither.  I am a moderate.  They are both hard-liners.|`|goe3y4FPaa	ANYONE THAT IS AGAINST ROSIE.. IS MY FRIEND.. SHES A  EVIL LADY|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Neither of them have any political standpoint so I choose to ignore both of them.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	They're both to radical for me, but if I had to have one for dinner I'd take Ann.  At least she knows she's crazy. LOL|`|NzKNNFwIaa	Ann Coulter.|`|7rCASaZIaa	I have to say I enjoy listening more to Ann Coulter. Rosie reminds me of when I was young and living in Communist China and had to listen to idiots ramble on and on about how fortunate we were as all the kids in America were supposedly starving to death and that all moms in the US were executed if caught stealing food for those supposedly starving children.|`|i9V7t3pRaa	Ann Coulter.  She's a bomb thrower, but so is Bill Maher.|`|hChhOhOGaa	They are not even in the same league!  Rosie is an uninformed gossip queen and Ann Coulter has a resume that could probably take down Obama.|`|QvNBEDA2aa	I can't stand how Ann delivers her messages, but she is obviously the more informed and intelligent.|`|9IHP4nA3aa	Even though I don't personally like Ann Coulter that well, she owns Rosie O'Donnell any day of the week.|`|gPq5zWLzaa	ROSIE ODONNELL DOESNT KNOW JACK SH<IT ABOUT POLITICS|`|AA11064727	Neither.  They are both morons.  But I would say I hate Rosie more.|`|X9VDzvo4aa	If those are my only two choices then O'Donnell but to be honest I don't like either of them that much.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Well, I don't always agree with Coulter, even tho I'm a Republican, but agreeing with Rosie would be admitting that I'm mentally unbalanced, just as she is.  No thanks.  I would have to say Coulter!|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Rosie viciously attacked Fight Club, allegedly because it attacked suburban values, so no.|`|AA10546011	Ann Coulter|`|oojO4WAraa	Generally, I don't agree with either one, they are both on the extreme edges.  I would have to say Rosie O'Donnell, because I almost always disagree with what Ann Coulter has to say.|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	Rosie "Palm" O'Donnell has swum way past the buoys and doesn't know what the hell she is talking about.<br>  <br>  Definitely Coulter...|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Neither....but O'Donnell is less nasty.
l5cxmTb9aa	Pay it forward?<br>  <br>  He keeps talking about how he inherited this mess. Seems to me he volunteered to fix it. Maybe he's making sure nobody else would want the job come next election.<br>  <br>  Personally I wouldn't want the job and don't understand why anyone would but I suppose this might be a viable campaign strategy for 2012.<br>  <br>  EDIT: People are complaining about blogs? I thought the mainstream media was sourcing blogs for most of their news these days. Why should we have any higher standard for news sources?|`|AA10382849	He has to pay for the dog.|`|84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	It's either that or keep borrowing.  The irony of all this borrowing is that it's from China.  We bought their stuff with our dollars.  Now they're lending our dollars back to us...at interest.  Had we kept a much larger portion of our production in the US, many of those dollars would be in the domestic economy in the form of higher wages, or at least more employed people paying into the tax bucket.  Since business and government dumped our workers and production for higher short term profits, 'Everyday Low Prices' and 'lower taxes', now we either have to admit we're a colony of China, or we're going to have to pay up to the tune of a trillion dollars in new taxes to cover the bill.  The 'bill' is the 'old taxes' we should have paid and the principal and interest on the money we borrowed so we could avoid paying the 'old taxes'.  It's either that or defalt or inflate.  Take 'yer choice!  No kiddin'!|`|G25kXYaraa	well we could have elected PALIN AND MCAIN WOW WHAT A BLUNDER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AND AT LEAST HE IS STICKING TO WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD DO SO Im for him hes the prez and im sticking with him its not like he came into office with a surplus hint hint|`|17ff1a09056aeb1f5d9144a39ec4436eaa	Who's Barry?|`|c3vPZfghaa	blog sources are always credible.<br>  <br>  Did you think war was free?|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	How else is he going to take from the rich and give to the poor!!  His spending bill will be given to those who do not create jobs but are entitlements and increased social programs.<br>  <br>  The problem will be that all the BIG Business that the libs hate will go to another country and then who will pay these tax increases when no one has a job!|`|YCL50xgnaa	Well bud, the Iraq War (which you probably supported) ain't cheap, and neither is the cost of jump-starting our economy.  As usual, Democrats have to fix the messes made by Republicans, and as usual, Republicans don't have any solutions, just whining.|`|51tNYexBaa	He's trying to fix all the Bushit that got us into this mess in the first place.

Please explain.|`|xSxqKF3Jaa	With all of our country's issues to talk about and fix this is completely off the handle. First, of all fugly is not a word. Also, I personally think Fox News is a great channel whose broadcasters tell the "true story" and are fair and balanced among the other liberal channels(which are not even fair and/or balanced). Why do you think Fox News has the highest cable ratings?|`|lzsyNKBzaa	I have a question for you, does it really matter?|`|i9V7t3pRaa	Because you need to get a life?|`|6D8BI1ffaa	Because being the Faux News network, they hire faux people.|`|6YuktLyNaa	The guys are old and ugly and the women are young and hot.

I don't think any of them have women who are nearly as attractive as the ones on fox.|`|vIO2jWu9aa	Fungly? What the heck is that?  Sorry but if you're looking for ugly, CNN has Larry King. Katie Curric is awful!<br>  <br>  I don't care what they look like.

He is young and looks good in a swimsuit. All superficial crap. forget about what a person might know. <br>  Your ultra-left hero, FDR was OLD and DYING in office, but was re-elected, while McCain was too old.<br>  Talk about discrimination<br>  Double standard superficial left wing loons.<br>  OOPS!!! sorry!!! I said something against Obama !!! That makes me a RACIST.<br>  It is all about image and political correctness.<br>  Bush wouldnt read a teleprompter, and had dyslexia. They crucified him and made cartoons of himas a monkey.<br>  Fast forward to Obama. When he answers a question he is not prepped for, he, ummm, doesnt um, know um quite, ummm what um,, to um say.....<br>  He is depicted as a monkey and there is outrage about evil racists.<br>  Again double standard.<br>  I am sorry.

AA12341057	No they aren't. Even if they were to try, it wouldn't legalize it in the United States, because federal laws supercede state laws.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Probably not.  Ammiano's bill was about decriminalizing and regulating it, getting more money into the state coffers by taxing and adding fees to the legal sales.  <br>  <br>  And as others have mentioned, federal law trumps state law, so it would be problematic.  Even though medical marijuana is legal here, the feds regularly raid dispensaries.|`|RRFbDou9aa	No.  Even if the overturn the state law it's still a federal crime.|`|qPDnxTE0aa	Federal law always over rules state law. Thus even if California legalized pot, federal law would over rule it and the person in possession of the pot would get penalized.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	no all they can do is remove it from a being a state crime.. the federal government would have to be the one to legalize it.|`|KZh3x4g9aa	why not,they are all insane anyway.....|`|hhWDHmfyaa	Nope.  It's all talk to get the public off the backs of the legislators right now.  With all the serious and unpopular issues facing legislators in California, this is a nice silly issue which a huge majority of the state will come together over.  The resounding answer is always the same: never.|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	its a federal law so not until the Feds legalize it which will be never, but California the State says its legal for medicinal use|`|f624b66aaed0290aaf76eedf3378ad4caa	Judging from your spelling and grammar, you've obviously already had your fair share and then some.|`|D4BRrUVxaa	I would not be surprised.

sq8wusnbaa	Well first get through high school. Then get through college and become an officer. Be over 5'4" or you can't fly a plane in the air force, I know i can't and that sucks. Here's a site for pilots, hope this helps! Good luck and don't give up!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.afrotc.com/collegelife/flying/prereq.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.afrotc.com/collegelife/flying...</a>|`|esOaJoqBaa	Sound like you are doing well. In high school study physics, and maybe engineering when you get to college. Any courses that will help you better understand the dynamics of flight would be good. Keep it up.
i3PGjRRfaa	No.<br>  <br>  But congratulations - you will be having a baby that I (as a taxpayer) will be responsible for raising...............|`|7HdgMaOnaa	Typical hmm this doesn't surprise at all|`|cz5XbKfOaa	Yes. The maximum income for 1 is $1127. The baby is not counted until born.|`|v42nC3F2aa	Probably, but you will not receive very much. Apply now,  and if you are eligible add the baby to your case. If you are ineligible now, apply again after the baby is born.|`|ne0EjucSaa	for food stamps you'd get like maybe 175 a month. It depends i was told you have to be 22 years old to be put on it.
dyAMG21Laa	You're mixing apples and oranges.  The death penalty is given to people who have been convicted in a court of law and then sentence to death for their crimes.  For the most part, smoking kills over 400,000 smokers who are addicted to a drug which they used initially without  knowledge of what was contained in the tobacco or knowledge of the addictive components of the additives.  Most smokers first began smoking when they were 12-14 yrs old and didn't have the maturity to think through their decision.  Most didn't initially realize that they were addicted to a drug and sadly, many couldn't or wouldn't quit until it was too late.  Death Penalty and Anti smoking are simple two very different causes of death and being one doesn't require being the other.|`|T864ejaiaa	if the judge and jury sends a person to death row then  they need to go. i say as soon as they are handed the death sentence they should be sent to the electric chair. especially rapist and child molesters.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	You could also mention that alcohol is the highest factor from recent figures in UK, that cause people to be admitted to hospitals. As well as drink related violence in and outside the home. People should leave smokers alone alcohol causes just as many deaths, if not more. You don't see suicidal people turning to smoking do you? they turn to drink! What would that suggest? hmmm? <br>  <br>  Also in the UK we don;t have the death penalty but I would recommend it for rapists and paedophiles, although there are those who argue that this is unjust as their behaviour could be cause by mental problems which should be treated first.|`|73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Don't forget about alcohol.  Think of all the deaths related to alcohol either directly (cirrhosis, pancreatitis, heart disease, etc.) AND indirectly (drunk driving deaths, alcohol-induced violence, etc.).<br>  <br>  I agree - it makes no sense that either of these two highly addictive products are legal, especially when other MUCH less harmful substances are illegal.<br>  <br>  The death penalty makes no sense, either.  It is horribly flawed, ineffective as a deterrent, and outrageously expensive to taxpayers.|`|hL6MGrMoaa	I'm not for the death penalty just for the reason that innocent people have been put to death. Smoking on the other hand is a free choice, which being Americans we're suppose to have.|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	The anti-smoking people are misguided, they really are just part of the anti big corporation crowd.
s1LfdCdsaa	If the child's father is illegal, there is nothing you can do to legally compel him to pay child support. He's not employed legally, so he isn't "on the books". He's paid under the table and therefore his salary can't be attached.<br>  <br>  You should want to keep the baby from him. His wife could possibly harbor ill feelings and take them out on the baby. If he's here illegally, he shouldn't be able to bring his wife here. If you think he's going to voluntarily pay child support with his wife's blessing, I've got a bridge to sell you.<br>  <br>  You don't have a legal leg to stand on with this illegal. You should report him to INS at once so that he is deported and his wife never makes it over here.<br>  <br>  In the future, you may want to consider sticking to Americans.|`|AA10410008	I am going to say this nicely....<br>  <br>  The sooner you get rid of him the better. Logically, emotionally AND financially. You really think you are going to get a dime out of him after he dropped you like a hot potato?? Not gonna happen....|`|5axNEp8jaa	Call the appropriate immigration authority's and report him and his wife and have them deported as soon as you can, by not getting him deported your essentially allowing him to use and abuse you.<br>  If he did this to you I honestly cant see how he would make a good father or why you would want him to be a father to your child, your obviously in a state of denial and unreality. If he is leaving you why would he care anything for your child?<br>  If he has a wife and I assume children why would he care for you?,your baby is just an anchor for him to gain Weight to any application for US citizenship.<br>  Look you made a major mistake, get over it and move on with your child without its father, any man can father a child only some can be fathers, and this man is not one of them.<br>  You wont get child support unless he's legal and I doubt if he will pay willingly otherwise. Just move on with your baby, have a happy life and learn from this mistake and you have my sympathy on this. Can I assume the Man is Mexican?

XNfjaPaSaa	The fairness doctrine was an old FCC regulation that said if TV or radio broadcasters broadcast opinions, they had to give equal broadcast time to the opposite opinion.  It hasn't existed since the 1980's.  The right is stirring up rumors that Democrats are trying to bring it back to kill conservative talk radio.  No one believes bringing it back has a chance of succeeding politically, even if a few people have made statements along the lines that they'd like to see it back. Even if it were brought back, it wouldn't prevent any broadcaster from broadcasting any opinion. It would just require them to be balanced and give equal time to the other side of an issue.  But there are so many different media outlets these days, each with their own niche and ideological bent, that nobody really thinks it's necessary to require any one broadcaster to give equal time in order for all opinions to be represented in the media marketplace.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	The fairness doctrine that is being supported by many liberals is to mandate that radio stations guarantee equal time for opposing viewpoints.  If a station has Rush Limbaugh on the air for 3 hours/day, then they must find a left wing person on the air for a similar amount of time.  <br>  <br>  Theoretically, it sounds like a good thing, except for a few MINOR points.<br>  <br>  1) They exempt ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS from the same rules, since according to the people promoting this bill, those stations treat both sides of the spectrum equally already.   Which, as we all know, is a complete lie, those stations are just Democratic party mouth organs.<br>  <br>  2) Rush Limbaugh is a huge profit maker for radio stations and it has been proven that most liberal radio hosts are UNPROFITABLE for the radio stations, so this would force radio stations to either choose between underwriting unpopular and unprofitable liberal radio hosts or removing the profitable conservative hosts from the air.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest reasons that conservative hosts are successful while liberal hosts are not successful, is NOT because of the message, but because conservatives can not go to ABC, NBC, CBS, or PBS and get reliable news.   Liberals can get news from many different sources and thus are not as reliant on liberal radio, thus making those hosts unprofitable.<br>  <br>  whale|`|RhDPB70Baa	A censoring of free speech preventing radio stations from broadcasting what they want.

TNTFomKeaa	Getting a counselor would be a really good idea. Also, don't hang out with any of your old friends that do drugs. Hang out with drug free friends. Make more if you have to. Stay away from social situations where you would have done drugs. Do different things. Go for coffee. Walk in the park. Watch movies. Distract yourself with sports and focus on school. Also, it worries me that your attitude is to keep off the drugs until you are off probation. You should be planning to stay off them. With the support of your family, good friends and a counselor, you will be able to do it. You will also be able to make positive changes in your life such as doing better at school so that you'll be able to have a better future. Good luck!|`|zejFr1Ciaa	I'm proud of you for completing the program ! Stay involved with your rehab group, don't renew old friendships that may have contributed to the problem.

Stay in touch with your counselor from your programs and in touch with your probation officer. His/her job is not only to keep you responsible for your probation conditions but to help you with other problems as well. Although I do not practice organized religion, I have seen it work wonders for many who have had problems. Much of who you will become, depends on whom you surround yourself with. Surround yourself with good people. Join clubs at schools or any other organization to keep you busy. Studies have shown younger folks who participate in sports and other school events have lower incidents of trouble. Best wishes.|`|c84a1d17484d06ded093e2e049596aaeaa	Find things to do with your free time that will  take your mind off of drugs, as well as keep you busy so that you are away from the people and places that wil tempt you do start using again. It sounds cliche, but, get a hobby! I would always advise people to try swimming, because it is not only one of the best exercises but also one of the simplest and most absorbing; once you start, time flies by like you wouldn't believe. If you are into sports, then join a school team. If not, join a school club that you are interested in. Get into photography, horseback writing, working out, writing, painting, gardening-- anything to keep you busy.<br>  <br>  Another great way to stay out of trouble is to make friends that are completely not into drugs. That way, you can go places with them and know that you will either be far far away from anyone or anywhere related to drugs or have people with you that can help you resist temptation. <br>  <br>  One piece of advice for you: don't listen to people who discourage you from doing things so just because you had problems in the past. You are a new person now! Start a new life! Good luck!!|`|wnWIxb9maa	Hello, NA meetings, AA meetings.

Our economy is collapsing because of the criminal activities of the Federal Government and the Private Federal Reserve.  Within a years time, you may be forced to decide what you support; Constitutional freedom and States rights, or more ignorance and slavery.<br>  <br>  <br>  "The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world."<br>  - Carroll Quigley, member of Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), mentor to Bill Clinton, quote from “Tragedy and Hope”, 1966|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	While I strongly support the state sovereignty movement, I feel the need to correct this common notion that it is somehow a "secessionist" movement.<br>  <br>  The sovereign States PRECEDED the Federal Government. The States consented to becoming part of a Confederated Republic, and thereby consented to create the Federal Government. <br>  <br>  Therefore, the States can just as easily disband the Federal Government and form a new one if said government refuses to obey the rule of law.<br>  <br>  The States ARE the Union. The Federal Government is just an empty shell.<br>  <br>  We are not citizens of the Federal Government.<br>  <br>  It is the Federal Government which has overstepped its bounds, and the sovereignty movement simply seeks to return to the rule of law under the Constitution.<br>  <br>  If a majority of the States choose to withdraw from this contract with the Federal Government, then it will be the Federal Government which becomes illegitimate, and forced out of the Union.<br>  <br>  That is not "secession," it is simply the abolition of a Federal government which is no longer legal.<br>  <br>  These are 2 very different things.<br>  <br>  And a majority of states (at least 30, as of now) have already proposed some such legislation. In some states, it has already passed.<br>  <br>  If this plays out to its POTENTIAL conclusion, then, in a sense, the only "secessionist" will be the Federal Government itself, as it is forcibly rejected by the States. In such a scenario, it would no longer be recognized by the States as a legitimate entity.<br>  <br>  That being said, Oklahoma is furthest along (it has passed its Senate resolution, I believe), while New Hampshire has introduced the most powerful legislation (and I've read many of the proposed resolutions from the various states -- only problem is, they're being introduced too fast for me to keep up!).|`|mdHqr17kaa	They won't secede.

If you'd been using both the car and the card prior to his arrest, then you should also have nothing to worry about, because you would have what is termed a "reasonable expectation" of permission, because you'd been using it for a length of time prior to the incident in question. Unless he can show that he rescinded permission, he won't have a case. Get a good attorney, and leave it up to them. Give them any evidence you have to show that you used both the car and the card prior to his arrest. If you were married, he wouldn't have a case at all, but it appears as though you were not.

4TkzoZThaa	Its not as simple as asking your attorney to pierce the corporate veil.  It is a legal matter whether or not the veil can be pierced.  I will guarantee that if it was possible he would have done it.  People sometimes think it is simple.  There are specific criteria that have to be met in order for a judge to pierce the corporate veil.  Often times the judges choose not to if the actions of the individual in the corporation fit the "business-judgment rule" which basically says if the corporate representative acted with reasonable justification (even if it proved to be faulty and stupid and unsuccessful) the corporate veil will rarely be broken.  <br>  <br>  If you feel like your attorney did not do what he promised to do...talk to him first.

Regulating capitalism, in a way that slows the redistribution of wealth to the rich, reduces the motivation for war.<br>  <br>  So, if by "inconsiderate" you mean "capitalist", then  you have a point, but...

ucYwexwJaa	A chapter 13 is a repayment plan, as opposed to a chapter 7 which is a liquidation  During a ch13 you will repay your delinquent accounts and keep the property you want to, and return anything you may not want or afford in full satisfaction of that debt.  A chapter 13 is usually filed when an individual cannot qualify for a chapter 7 because they earn too much money, and simply need to bring their spending under control.  The benefit to filing any bankruptcy however is the "automatic stay" that is placed on your property, forbidding creditors from calling you or repossessing your property, foreclosure, etc.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	A chapter 13 bankruptcy is also called a wage earner's plan. It enables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their debts. Under this chapter, debtors propose a repayment plan to make installments to creditors over three to five years. If the debtor's current monthly income is less than the applicable state median, the plan will be for three years unless the court approves a longer period "for cause." (1) If the debtor's current monthly income is greater than the applicable state median, the plan generally must be for five years. In no case may a plan provide for payments over a period longer than five years. 11 U.S.C. §1322(d). During this time the law forbids creditors from starting or continuing collection efforts.<br>  <br>  This chapter discusses six aspects of a chapter 13 proceeding: the advantages of choosing chapter 13, the chapter 13 eligibility requirements, how a chapter 13 proceeding works, what may be included in chapter 13 repayment plan and how it is confirmed, making the plan work, and the special chapter 13 discharge.

The economy is an entity that is by far more powerful than any human force on the planet and when it moves or shifts there is nothing we can do to stop or alter it. Only a fool believes that the government is in control or has the ability to fix the economy. Unfortunately we have a lot of fools in this country who are fine with the government pissing away over $1 trillion of our money on pipe dreams.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	The problem is that economics is not an empirical science. It is as much theoretical as it is factual, and certain foundations are not necessarily all encompassing. <br>  That is why you have such a divurgence of opinion amongst Economists. Some are supply side, some are Keynesian. There theories are often exactly opposite. <br>  When you take such a diverse group of thought, and then throw a completely new economic mess at them, they will have a wide variety of whatt they think will work. During the late 70's and early 80's, economists were equally divided over how to deal with the high inflation rate and the stagnant economy, because theory said that should not happen. Theory held that inflation only occurred when demand outstripped supply. The Fed Chairman initially took the fight to kill the inflation rate, by traditional method... choke off demand by raising interest rates. It wasnt until 1982, when Volker reversed course, and expanded the monetary by lowering interest rates, that economy began to recover. The problem was that the inflation had been caused by massive hikes in oil costs in the 70's, and the inflation was merely reflecting the higher (and arbitrary) OPEC oil costs, as th cost of oli products was inherent in ever goods and service produced. Once that cost was absorbed into cost, inflation subsided.

Most on Medicare is the old people living on social security but medicare only pays 80% so you still have to have a supplement policy.

And yeah, their costs may go up, but their costs aren't nearly what most Americans are paying for healthcare.  I think my Dad's is $100 per month.  Oh and medicare isn't free, did you know that?

What you posted sounds different from the real news, like the Chief said.<br>  To summarize the news already posted by Chief, it says that the position of Napolitano AND President Obama is inconsistent with the way that raid took place.<br>  Second, it seems that also the website is biased against those immigrants. You can see that when you see the page, it is only obsessed about illegal immigration and apparently done to incite hate. Looks like a website from supremacy groups because is only stand on one side, and that is a clue for people not to trust that kind of information. Many antis love to go to those websites because they only told them what they want to hear and they don't accept other opinions. When you tell them something different they don't want to accept it.<br>  Also, the article posted by Stone shows that the policies from Obama regarding immigration are consistent with a more humane treatment against illegals, he wants to deal with the immigration issue in a more respectful manner because that is what a REFORM is about. People can't go and do raids that are not authorized just because they want to do it, that is not the position of the president or Napolitano.<br>  And I guess that SOME antis need to understand what is a reform. Its not about killing, or rounding or deporting in an inhumane way. That is not the solution, but for simplistic minds who think that those matters have to be dealt in that way, that is the only solution they have. Those simplistic mind are the ones trying to spread propaganda coming on daily basis posting hate thinki8ng that will work, and that is what the antis need to learn. Things are not resolved that way or they continue with anger. I think that many antis have anger issues and when things are not their way they just explode with no rational solution because they never learn to think rationally.|`|Y5S2dDkYaa	What kills me every time is how the Politicos and Liberal Lobbyists of the world are so out of touch <br>  <br>  Just look at these posts; most ordinary people who aren't actors, politicians or millionares are disgusted with illegal immigration and support legal enforcement; and they aren't hillbillies or racists, they're just ordinary people!!|`|h6c0qGwaaa	Well I finally figured out why you do not like to post the links for where your information comes from.<br>  Well I will post the link to the blog you used for you again.<br>  <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/26/gasp-dhs-secretary-alarmed-that-immigration-laws-enforced-under-her-watch/" rel="nofollow">http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/26/gas...</a><br>  <br>  To compare what you posted and what is written in the newspaper article one just has to read. I hope you do not mind my using a copy and paste as my entire answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Napolitano orders review of WA raid"<br>  <br>  "Immigration agents this week conducted their first work-site raid since President Barack Obama took office, but it was news to their boss, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who on Wednesday ordered a review of the action."<br>  <br>  By MANUEL VALDES<br>  <br>  Associated Press Writer<br>  SEATTLE —<br>  <br>  "Immigration agents this week conducted their first work-site raid since President Barack Obama took office, but it was news to their boss, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who on Wednesday ordered a review of the action.<br>  Workplace raids involving the arrests of hundreds of illegal immigrants at a time became almost routine in the last years of the Bush administration, but Napolitano's response to Tuesday's raid at a Bellingham, Wash., manufacturing plant highlighted the Obama administration's much different approach to a hot-button issue.<br>  Napolitano told lawmakers during a hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday that she did not know about the raid before it happened and was briefed on it early Wednesday morning. She has asked U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which arrested 28 illegal immigrants in the raid, for answers.<br>  "I want to get to the bottom of this as well," she said. She said work-site enforcement needs to be focused on the employers.<br>  In a statement, an ICE official said the agency conducted the raid after information from two "gang members" led agents to start an investigation at the company.<br>  "Follow-up investigation uncovered a potentially large number of illegally employed workers. ICE conducted the operation in order to identify and, if appropriate, apprehend any unauthorized workers and to further determine potential criminal activity," ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in an e-mail from Washington, D.C.<br>  The raid at Yamato Engine Specialists was the first work-site action ICE has taken since Obama took office, said Sean Smith, a spokesman at Homeland Security in Washington, D.C.<br>  Obama, who appointed Napolitano, has signaled a shift in immigration policy that would rely less on work-site enforcement, focusing instead on employers who hire illegal immigrants and on overall immigration reform.<br>  ICE agents rounded up 25 men and three women at the engine shop, all Mexicans except for a Honduran, a Salvadoran and a Guatemalan. Except for three people freed on humanitarian grounds, those arrested are at a detention center in Tacoma, awaiting deportation proceedings.<br>  In a statement Tuesday, ICE officials said many of the people obtained the jobs using fake Social Security numbers and other counterfeit documents.<br>  Shirin Dhanani Makalai, whose family owns the business, said the raid came after months of cooperating with ICE on an audit, which included providing employee rosters to federal authorities on several occasions. She said the family-owned business does not advocate hiring illegal immigrants.<br>  "We try to stay within the guidelines, within the law," Makalai said Tuesday.<br>  Makalai added that the company did not knowingly hire illegal immigrants, and that employers have no clear way of checking an employee's legal status. Tuesday's raid marked the second time ICE had taken workers from the factory, but Makalai said that after an audit in 2006, agents conducted individual interviews, instead of a raid.<br>  She said that family members - who are originally from Uganda - estimate about 60 agents came into the sprawling factory and asked management to round up the workers. She said the business is losing about $60,000 a day and lost four highly skilled workers.<br>  "We were completely blind-sided," Makalai said.<br>  For immigrant advocacy groups, the raid was a surprise as well.<br>  Marissa Graciosa of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, said it was deeply disappointing that ICE has executed a raid since Obama took office. She called the raids destructive and ineffective.<br>  "We urge President Obama to deliver on his promise of change by stopping the raids, and signing just and humane immigration reform into law," Graciosa said.<br>  Immigrant advocates in Seattle called on Obama to place a moratorium on raids until there's immigration reform from Congress.<br>  Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter enforcement of immigration laws, said Napolitano's call to review the raid goes along with an expectation that Obama will slash work-site raids.

Bad people will always find a way to do what they want to do so why should the people who want to do it legally be punished? <br>  <br>  I think there should be more training involved. If more people had their Concealed Weapons Permit then maybe when a person, or group of people run into a building and start shooting for whatever reason, atleast a few people will be there to do something instead of sacrificing themslelves to barricade doors, or running around screaming... <br>  <br>  Now days anyone can walk into anywhere and as long as he gets himself a gun the chance of opposition is very small. <br>  <br>  I think self defense should be taught in school. Not only against hand to hand, and not as simple as walking up to a bag doing a half *** kick and them saying its good.<br>  <br>  Again The "Bad" people will do what they want anyway, instead of submitting to them and keeping guns from people like that Marine that had his permit and took his handgun to school, then got in trouble.<br>  <br>  If it was Columbine and people woulda been armed and trained then I bet situations like that would go alot differently. People die anyway.. Why should students have to run or hit the floor and just hope they dont get hit or die before the proper unit is scrambled and put into action.<br>  <br>  The majority of the public is caring people who would try and stop them, not use their guns to kill innocent people.<br>  <br>  Kinda of subject but Im getting kinda worried about them taking it away.|`|4vkhb5bxaa	I am for almost all folks being allowed to own guns, I do believe it is a right under our constitution to bear arms.

I believe that all who want to own guns must show that they understand gun safety. Over and above that, it is everyone who is an American, it is their right to own one. I believe the exception to the law is when a gun is used in the commitment of a crime, the person who criminally abuses his/her right looses his/her right to own guns.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	I am all for upholding the Constitution, and that includes the right to bear arms.

Any job created by the stimulus is only there temporarily or is part of a new pet project created by an earmark in the stimulus. It is grossly unnecessary spending in a time when we don't have money to spend, and the spending under Bush pales in comparison to it. I am not defending Bush, he wasn't a conservative and spent just like a liberal would and expanded government, which I am against. The only reason you are for all this is because Obama told you it was good, and you believe him. The government can only make money by printing it, which just devalues every dollar you and I have. The government cannot spend money without first taking it from you and me, which does nothing but hurt the economy. If you are losing your home or your job right now you have no one to blame but those who crafted the COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT which forced banks to give loans to people who couldn't afford them, hence subprime mortgages. And you know who did that? Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Nancy Pelosi, etc, LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. But you believe everything that you are told and are too lazy to do a little research or investigation of your own.<br>  <br>  We all agree that we need to do something about the economy, cause it sucks. But wastefully spending money we don't have on things we don't need causes inflation and takes capital out of the market, increasing taxes which does nothing but decrease consumer spending and retard job growth. If you want to help the economy let people, businesses and investors keep more of their money, aka cut taxes. Some carefully targeted spending in key areas might also help, but only if it is coupled with private investment to stimulate an industry. <br>  <br>  Your grasp of economics is nonexistant, so your right to weigh in on the subject is also, nonexistant.|`|9S8N00zWaa	I hear its amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hari Kiri Rock.

AA11494150	You can get a dozen answers to this question, and they will all be right. Or wrong.<br>  <br>  A speed limit is the maximum speed allowed under ideal conditions. Things such as traffic density, pedestrians in the area, construction zones, weather and road conditions, and many other factors can influence an officer's tolerance for speed.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is the accuracy of your speedometer. It is not unusual to be 3, 4, or even 5 mph off. If you think you are only doing 5 or 6 over, you could be doing 11 over. That may be the difference between a warning and a ticket. <br>  <br>  10 over on a clear day with good visibility and no other traffic might be a warning, but 10 over on a dark rainy night in heavy traffic may be a ticket.|`|RRFbDou9aa	The line is 1mph, but every officer is different.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	If you want to ensure that you will not receive a ticket, then do the speed limit, simple as that. Anything over is the discretion of the officer. When I was young, my very first speeding ticket I think I was doing 10+ in a zone. The cop was leniant and gave me a ticket for doing 1 mph over the limit. So since I got a ticket for doing 1 mph over the answer is 0. If you are doing 46 in a 45 you can be pulled over. <br>  <br>  I learned a few years ago that if I want to stop being hassled by the cops, then the simplest thing for me to do is to stop breaking the law.|`|wnWIxb9maa	In AR it's 5 mph over.  Some places I have been when I was stationed in Whidbey Island were zero over, But I suspect they were speed traps.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	Technically 0 however most traffic officers will cut you a little slack.|`|XLSfTnISaa	Depends on the Officer.  I usually give 10.|`|Tkb1TKwZaa	Really, from experience, if you drive as fast as everyone around you, you'll be fine.  And as the poster above said, it also depends on conditions. And also the road you're on.  One 40 mph speed zone might be windy and narrow, whereas another could be straight and wide.  So cops will judge differently from that.<br>  <br>  Also though, it kinda depends on the mood of the cop.  They normally let you go over, but if they're in a bad mood, they have every right to pull you over if you are even a little over the limit.<br>  <br>  ^I was driving this one time, and i was behind a cop car who was behind another car on a one lane road.  The front car went out of its way to drive lower than the speed limit, which was wayy slower than anybody normally drives on the road.  I was getting annoyed, and i'm sure the cop was too.  Then, maybe getting annoyed too, the front car sped up a little.  The moment it passed the speed limit, the cop pulled it over.  <br>  <br>  So there's no real *amount* you can go over.  If you *REALLY* don't want to be pulled over, don't drive over the limit.  But when you do, as long as it looks controlled and not reckless from the cops POV, they'll let you slide (unless you've done something to annoy them)

98JZcrO6aa	This is what really gets on my nerves with the government. The government has basically become the puppets of the <br>  banks. It seems like Britain (politicians in particular) has become so obsessed with money that it feels like the banks have got the country at ransom. The government should not have given this money to the banks but not exactly give the money to the people but use this money to make people's lives better e.g. provide insulation so energy  bills can be cut, invest this money in renewable energy (wave power sounds ideal and it is a BRITISH invention but the main reason the government isn't investing in these energy sources is because the government couldn't be asked to invest in this energy so the Wave energy companies are now setting up in Portugal instead rather than Great Britain. )<br>  <br>  If i was in power, i would have used this bail out money to provide as many homes in the UK as possible with insulation so that this will cut people's energy bills now and will help them in the future as well. Not to mention it would save the construction industry because they would be hired to do this work and they will be paid out of the money. This money should not have gone to the banks, us taxpayers will have to pay for this stimulus out of our taxes and we aren't even 100% sure that the banks would even lend this money anyway. <br>  <br>  <br>  Not only that, i would have let RBS go down the pot and everyone who has money in RBS will be guarnateed all of their money in that bank up to ￡100,000. If you had more than that in the bank, we would not be able to retrieve that extra amount. If anyone complains really, its the banks faults for starting this mess.<br>  <br>  Any other money would be used to invest in wave power and this wave power will need employees to supply this energy.

A word to assist in an edge to get the masses on board to get their vote. He not exsperienced, he got their too easily and some say illegaly. He's trying and that is a good thing but remember there are many around him such as the Joint chiefs of staff who do have exsperience and it would be wise for him to lean on their exspertise. Even the exsperienced presidents all before him do this. Stop sounding like oh finally finally we have someone after all these centuries to fix this country mess. Aren't you part of the mess in some ways? I knwo I have to be and all the others before us... I personally di nto liek the choices for President this time around. I really didn't. I thought Mccain was too far extreme from what woudl be good for me. Yeah that was one of my thoughts. And as Obama, He got one of the highest awards because he part black... and you know that!|`|mlpYzrtvaa	Some of us did Our home work others voted race:<br>  <br>  Obamas Political Views:<br>  <br>  Disavowal of the Pursuit of “Middleclassness” <br>  <br>  Classic methodology on control of captives teaches that captors must keep the captive ignorant educationally, but trained sufficiently well to serve the system. Also, the captors must be able to identify the “talented tenth” of those subjugated, especially those who show promise of providing the kind of leadership that might threaten the captor’s control. <br>  <br>  Those so identified as separated from the rest of the people by: <br>  <br>  Killing them off directly, and/or fostering a social system that encourages them to kill off one another. <br>  <br>  Placing them in concentration camps, and/or structuring an economic environment that induces captive youth to fill the jails and prisons. <br>  <br>  Seducing them into a socioeconomic class system which while training them to earn more dollars, hypnotizes them into believing they are better than others and teaches them to think in terms of “we” and “they” instead of “us”…
7uznrLBXaa	You - or your attorney - should have done your homework and removed your name from the mortgage and title.  Since this did not happen, I'm going to guess this was not financially possible for either you or your ex.  <br>  <br>  Yes, it will hurt your credit - which is why removing your name was the ideal situation.|`|AA11206283	It will allow you to status the collections on your record as "disputed" and to give the decree as a reason for it<br>  <br>  Yes.|`|AA11881876	It will not help your credit.  He has damaged that already if you are on the note.  You may win a decree but that may not make him pay.  He would not get jailed as it is a civil matter.  Fines are not likely either.  If you can pay the arrears, sue him him for possession and take over possession of the house.  Get a decree evicting on the grounds of  failure to perform.  If you win you may be able to get the sheriff to put him out in as little as 30 days depending on the local laws and the judges decree.|`|qhe2nbIyaa	yes it will help you, you absolutely should NOT be paying for anythings, especially if the house is his responsibility. do not let him take advantage of you.

You would probably need at least 3 months of bank statements showing that you have enough money to support yourself and will not be working during that time.|`|93a54e25bc4518bbeae2c0d1b7716654aa	No, just a passport.|`|KO5gd52Aaa	For 6 months, yes. As a US Citizen you are able to visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa, but any longer than that and you'll need to apply for a tourist visa.|`|YCL50xgnaa	You can only stay for 90 days without a visa.

kZeu2Dyzaa	Cutting INCOME taxes on the wealthiest Americans has historically increased government tax revenues overall as they are more likely to invest/trade with that money and thereby incur capital gains taxes which are at a much higher rate than income taxes.<br>  <br>  It isn't a theory, it is a phenomenon.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Ronald Reagan's trickle down theory that doesn't work.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	Try googling Arthur Laffer or Supply Side Economics.

AA10123414	As long as you are making at least minimum wage they can legally pay you anything they want. They could even cut your wages.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Whether it's legal and whether it's fair are two different questions.  Yes, it's legal.  Legally they just have to pay you minimum wage and not a penny more.  They could legally cut your pay down to minimum and there's nothing you can do about it.
vGu6bcR9aa	I don't know how many points it is, but you can go to jail for it.|`|mSrnLnNcaa	it depends honestly, if the cops came out and you weren't there, if they find you, you could be charged with hit and run, even if nothing was seriously damaged. Secondly you should report it to the DMV otherwise your license could be suspended, thats how it works in California anyways.
41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	18<br>  <br>  Nam was still going and I knew the college scene just wasn't ready for me yet. The Army looked pretty good. And it was,  I stayed 22 years.<br>  <br>  I think currently you can be 38 but I wouldn't carve that in stone.<br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  US Army<br>  retired|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	I sound like suredo187 above...<br>  <br>  I joined the Army at 19, when my parents held to their promise that they'd stop paying for college if I didn't keep my grades up.  A semester of a 1.12 will do that!!  I joined primarily for the college money, with a tiny bit of "I'm a Patriot, and this is what Patriots do," mixed in.<br>  <br>  A year later, I was booted out after being caught in a Reduction In Force (RIF).<br>  <br>  Five years later, I rejoined the Army to get the final sense of accomplishment that I didn't the first time around - considering the quality of some of my friends that DIDN'T get kicked out.  I served my three years and bailed out at the end of it.<br>  <br>  Two years later, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the day after the air war started, I enlisted in the Army a third time.  In the huge drawdown the year after the Gulf War, I again bailed out - knowing that I had gotten all the "adventure" out of my system.<br>  <br>  I took my physical the next day for the Coast Guard, and went to Boot Camp at 30 years old.  I've been in ever since - some 17 years, making it 22 years total, and I don't see myself getting out before I hit 30 years.<br>  <br>  To join the National Guard, the max age is 42 years old.  Every service has different standards, so you'll have to check out the recruiting web sites.  I know the Coast Guard is 27 - with a Prior Service waiver to age 32.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	I was 24 and had my B.S. degree.  I needed a job and my professor suggested I try the military.  Out of respect for him, I went to the recruiters and told them what I was and what I wanted.  The Army was the only one that knew what they were talking about and showed me an MOS that fit my degree.  I aced the test and spent three years in a biological research laboratory, LAIR at PSF, CA.<br>  When I tried to come back as a JAG officer, I was too old at 38.|`|uurgL3oZaa	19. Flunked outta college and it was either the military or trying to claw my way into an assistant manager position at the local Burger King. Enlisting in the Navy sounded cooler. Not sure about today, but back then the age limit was 32.<br>  <br>  It worked out pretty well. It might have been a 5 year detour, but I'm about to get my Bachelor's.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	I graduated high school at 17 and went right into the Marines, served for one tour (which got extended) and got out after the Gulf War (1990-1991).  My family has a long tradition of service with the Marines, and it was something I wanted to do to prove to myself I could.  It was a kind of coming of age ritual for me, I suppose, and I also wanted to do my part for the country I love (but don't always like).  <br>  <br>  I don't know what the maximum age for recruits into the Marines is these days.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	In September of 1965, I wrote a blank check payable to the United States of America for up to, and including, my life.  That check is still outstanding.   When I enlisted, I took an oath.  To me personally, that oath still is in effect:<br>  "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God." <br>  <br>  I joined the U.S. Navy at almost 19.  I joined to get out of slower, lower Delaware and see the world.  I accomplished both.  I was on 5 ships, sailed 8 oceans/seas, was on 6 of the 7 continents, stationed in 3 countries (my family was with me in 2), visited over 30 countries (some more than once), picked up 7 languages (already spoke Finn, Spanish and French...Italian, Japanese, Russian, Swahili, Turkish, Cantonese, Hindi) enough to get something to eat, get directions, carry on a limited conversation.  I spent 13 months in Antarctica.  I still keep in touch, although loosely, with several old shipmates and with 2 people I met while traveling the world.  I traveled as far north as Nova Scotia, as far south as Antarctica, as far east as Pakistan, and as far west as Thailand.  I spent 20 years, 2 months and one day on active duty and my retirement more than pays for my mortgage.<br>  I'd do it again without hesitation.|`|LyVjJ0ylaa	Joined the Army on Delayed Entry Program at 17. Graduated from basic on my 18th birthday.  Was retired for medical disability 12 years later.<br>  <br>  Family history of serving.  Was going for 20 when I broke my back and forced to retire.  Wanted to serve my country as my father did.<br>  <br>  Not sure of oldest age allowed but I do know they just raised it to 40 something.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	I joined at 18 because I was unemployed, wanted to serve my country, and wanted to do something different.<br>  <br>  The oldest you can join the Army (all components) is the day before you turn 42.  The other branches have lower cut-off ages.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	I joined the Navy when I was 17 went to Bootcamp at 18.  Honestly I joined because I didn't see much of a future the way I was headed.  No chance at college or a decent job (A lot of it due to my stupidity as a kid)  I retired from the Navy 6 Years ago and currently work for a large company making more than I did as an E-6 with 20 Years in.  It was ABSOLUTELY the best discision of my life .  I believe the current age restriction for enlistment is 35.|`|pf8GXvMYaa	Age of 20. Because of family tradition, Honor, guidance, its always been a dream of mine. I joined the Army, not my first choice but I don't regret it, Unlike the AirForce they let me choose amongst many jobs based on my GT score of 121. I still chose a combat MOS, Field artillery.<br>  <br>  I believe the Age cut off is 42 to enlist.|`|NNBk36UKaa	I joined the US Army at 18.  I was fresh out of high school and didn't know what to do with myself.  I went to college after my ETS.<br>  <br>  I am not sure, but I remember being in bootcamp with a 40 year old.
