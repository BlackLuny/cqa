2MGJAwM9aa	IMM ? You mean Singapore's IMM ??!!!! I realised that you have posted quite a number of Singapore's question at the Batam section . To go IMM , take MRT until Juring East interchange and walk thru Popular Bookstore . There , you can either walk to IMM ( a new pathway is built ) or take the free shutter bus ( very very crowded ) .
a98e150cfa09fe2b7d2bc113876ca12baa	If you are from east or western region use the east west line of the MRT or from north-south line transfer @ city hall or north-east line transfer @ outram station and drop at Jurong East Station.  If you cannot walk then take a shuttle bus but I would rather walk across the road than wait for the bus.

AA10426969	Hello,    I live in Greensboro. The trick with Greensboro is to live in the West Side, or the Downtown area. Avoid East Greensboro, and South Greensboro. Avoid Southeast Greensboro like the plague.    What is your budget? If you've got a ton of money maybe take a look at "The Lofts at Greensborough Court"     There are plenty of apartment complexes in Greensboro, but frankly they aren't usually the nicest places to stay.     Instead, the houses for rent are often quite nice. You can usually find nice places to rent along Mendenhall and Tate Street, if you have time to drive around while you are here.    Also, Rent a home of the triad rents higher end properties  http://www.gsorentahome.com/    Good luck!

iB1omurkaa	This is one way, it's a site I have been using for the past two months to raise a bit more money for my trip to Paris, it will not cost you anything to use but also it will not make u a fortune over night... each month ive gotten about 30-40$ depending on how much i participated.    All you do is sign up for offers by entering your e-mail adress and click accept and then once the offer is approved the money goes into your account .. it ranges from 50 cents to 2$.. you can get paid by check, or by pay pal. Its called treasure troopers, and in addition you get to play minigames after each offer to find a gem which adds up and u can trade them for gift cards and other items used to participate on the site... heres the link if your interested. Its a nice site, and it pays, this is the only one so far i have found that actually does!    http://www.treasuretrooper.com/484442|`|rICo3UZJaa	go to the hospital and apply for a transportation aide. this job  pushes people in wheelchairs to and from the entrance of the hospital to where they need to go.

cxNLOPHNaa	No, not a crazy question... Those places can often surprise one, by what they carry.    I have not seen pompons (they are correctly spelled with an "n"), in drug or grocery stores. I have seen them occasionally in WalMart. Both in the crafting/sewing department and also by the novelty shoelaces. The most dependable places for locating pompons, are at JoAnn, Michaels, and online at Tassel Depot

The only work a 14 year old can get is odd jobs from people and get paid under the table or like apple/berry picking, etc. If you don't absolutely need to work, you should enjoy being a kid and the time before you are pushed into the work force.|`|5jIdcbyYaa	You must be 16 when you start working at retails.|`|E9szvgGLaa	i think u have to be 16|`|VWcqTzYHaa	nope you either have to be 16 or 18 to work at a store. i know american eagle is 16 or 18 for sure|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	no
aFYmJKtnaa	Hi there and good luck in your job search.   (I am looking too here in Southern CA...)    One thing I would advice is don't watch the news and it'll keep your spirits up because it is so depressing. I get all my headline news on Yahoo or MyYahoo and it tells me the most important things I want and need to know....    As for finding a job in Stockton:    I would simply put a search on either Yahoo or Google or even Ask.com and put "good jobs in Stockton, CA" and see what comes up. I know I do that with my area and tons of websites come up.  I don't live close to you to know what the economy is like there, but at least that will give you some websites to play with.    If you want to give me your email address I'll see what I can find for you.     God bless you & Good Luck,    Paulette Le Pore Motzko|`|rICo3UZJaa	try the hospital, the library, the va,|`|8ZARrsnXaa	try blue cross.
BmFjxbqAaa	The person that you bought it from, can you get a hold of them and if you can then ask them. Maybe they did not get payment, or do you have a tracking no for it. If so then get a hold of the place that has the tracking info and ask them if they can track it to see where it is give them the name of the phone and the day you bought it , how much it was and when it was suppose to be be sent,(the date that is that is) and then they will then track it and they can find out where it is and how has it).
AA10464818	Grants to fix up a house are RARELY given, and only to those 65+ and above living in very poor rural areas.  There is a grant from US Department of Agriculture called 10.417 Very Low-Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants that a senior citizen may qualify to get home repairs grant http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALO...    It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business.     One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product. Another exception could be the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/... , which fund the research and development of technological innovation that meets specific government needs.     Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/mostrequesteditems/CO...    -------------------------  "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."  -------------------------  Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.    Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|rICo3UZJaa	the library usually has free '101' classes for grant writing and receiving or the workforce center.
AjUeMj5daa	I haven't ordered from IKEA and I personally don't buy their furniture because it's cheap.  You get what you pay for, but it's understandable if you're first moving out on your own.    Try going to local thrift stores like Goodwill, they often times have amazing furniture that just needs a polish.  Check weekly for new inventory so you can snag the item before anyone else does.
0HYfFZKVaa	You are definitely on the right track. You should continue trying to attend the events and do what you can to get yourself know. Without being offensive introduce yourself to a member and briefly discuss that you have been attending their events and really enjoy them. Also, if you haven't already try to volunteer somewhere, you may be able to meet a member and build a personal relationship. Don't give up, follow your dream and in due time it will happen. Good Luck!!!
