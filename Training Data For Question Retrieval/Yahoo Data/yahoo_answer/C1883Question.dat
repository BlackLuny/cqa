And someone told me to download Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Shockwave Player on adobe.com. And that was a success. But she also told me to download Macromedia Flash Player 7 and Macromedia Shockwave Player on macromedia.com. And when I go to macromedia.com it goes to adobe.com. And even when I search it up it goes to Adobe. And If I can't download I can't play shockwave games. Is Adobe and Macromedia the same? Or are they two different things. Because they both go to the same website with the same download when I search for it. And for Adobe I already downloaded that and when I search for the download on Macromedia. It goes to the download on Adobe which I already downloaded. So I really need help. And normally when I try to play shockwave games an error comes up. Saying that there is a missing-plugin. And I had a choice of installing it. But when I install it, It doesn't work as usual. I really need help. My shockwave stuffed up on Saturday. Help!

20070104072201AAKCxkj	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How do you use VB to use an Access Database which is importing dbase III .dbf files from a timeclock software?	There are two pieces of software. (1) Kronos which collects the time data and store in .dbf files. (2) An Access database which imports these files (they have to be done manually everyday after deleting the old files from yesterday). Access .mdb database has multiple queries and reports based on these tables. Now, the question is how do we automate the process for average supervisor with no IT experiece so that she can click on a button-import .dbf files (and replace the old ones) to Access and look at the various reports based on multiple queries? Any suggestions? Is it better to do it using VB and ADO.NET or there are simpler ways of connecting these two existing programs? From Kronos, one has to manually create those .dbf files which is not a problem. The problem is to import those files in Access by click of a button and produce the reports.

20070129074045AA5dkmW	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Can I use two cable modems with one Time Warner Cable account?	I have Time Warner Cable in NYC with a coaxil connection in both my living room and bedroom. The cable modem resides in my bedroom and I connect to the internet for Xbox live via a wireless network adapter and router.      For whatever reason, my wireless connection is pretty crappy and am thinking of just going the true "wired" route to connect my Xbox 360 to Xbox Live so that I have a pure connection. But, I'm not interested in buying 100 feet of CAT5 cable and routing the wire from the bedroom to the living room.      My question is, since I also have a coaxil connection in the living room (for the TV of course), could I split that connection and send one coaxil to the TV and the other to a second cable modem for the Xbox 360 and possibly even another router? Or am I only allowed to use one cable modem per Time Warner account?

20070824080502AAmNKmR	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What is a good tool for viewing all local policies?	The Group Policy Management Console is a good tool for viewing exactly which policies are configured.  Is there a similar tool for local policies?  I just need an easy-to-read list of all locally configured policies.  GPEdit.msc is difficult to sift through.  GPResult.exe lists in terms of registry settings, so it's not very easy to work with.  The Group Policy Monitor GUI wouldn't even work, so that was a bust.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!
20070808124641AAsSpQ1	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How would you determine the time zone for a list of cities?	I have about 1600 computers that were distributed with incorrect time zone settings (all were set to EST).  I have a script that will remotely change the time zone.  I also have a spreadsheet that contains the IP address and location (city & state) of each computer.      Now I just need to crunch the data somehow.  There are pages that allow you to enter the city and get the time zone, but I'm not doing that 1600 times.  What I really need is a spreadsheet or database that maps cities to time zones.  Any idea where I can find one?  Or maybe another suggestion?

20070423213842AAy5DSX	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	How do I reroute or redirect Remote Desktop Connections?	We have offices in 3 locations.  Location (C) is set up with our terminal server and the other 2 locactions could always access the TS with Windows Remote Desktop, ie, A to C or B to C.  For some reason, location (A) could no longer establish this connection (no ping replies) but the other location (B) is just fine.  (There is also connection between A and B.)      I need to know if there is a way I can connect from A to B and then to C in order to establish this TS connection (instead of A to C directly).      I hope this makes sense and any help is appreciated.  It's been down for more than 24 hours now and it's kind of important we get it back on line.      Thanks,      Mike

I have narrated a powerpoint presentation directly into a powerpoint.  Works great.  For one slide I had another person do the narration and the sound is too weak.  I want to know if I can extract the specific sound file for the powerpoint, and perhaps boost the sound level and place back in the file-- even as a wav file or something.  As far as I can see the narrations are imbedded into the presentation and I cannot locate where the individual sounds would be located or where and how to edit.  I can raise the sound but only on the entire presentation. Thanks!!!

20090309091042AAKqfM5	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Major XP Problem you guys!?	Today has been a long day. I've noticed that when I used Google or Ask.com, my web browser would be redirected to another page besides the one I chose and it really got frustrating and when I clicked on my external drive it said recycler not found, but when I went to Explore, I could get into the drive. I downloaded Smitfraudfix to see if there were any problems or viruses in the registry, and that's when the problems started getting worse. I told it to check for problems and a message said that I was being hacked by a DNS and an ip address, not really sure what that was and I could no longer get online. I restarted and then my graphics, System Restore, internet, I.E., and Outlook, all started having problems and saying everything was "Access Denied", so I did a virus scan, nothing came up. What I thought was really strange was I checked the network and it was gone, and I found a back way to get to I.E., but kept getting errors that it couldn't connect to the internet and I couldn't get on MSN Live, but I could get on another type of chat messenger, and no other, which makes no sense whatsoever. I then checked the internet drivers, I saw that only one was in the list (out of 4), I tried getting those files on there, no success. And Windows XP is having problems everywhere and it's not even working. I admit I've downloaded some torrents (a very very good reason you guys, I never did it once besides this time because I was trying to save this other drive.)      I'm using Xubuntu as a spare (thank goodness I have this installed.) So guys, is XP gone or is there still hope?

There are several distros out there that IMO are a lot better for someone getting started with linux.  PClinixOS, Mepis, or Mint are all easier to set up and work better right out of the box (flash, codecs, nvidia/ati drivers).      I know that ubuntu has a huge user base and thus more people to ask questions to when you do have problems, but I have found that in the PCLOS, and Mepis (never used mint) forums you don't get all the "search for it" or "read the manual" answers.

20090309083651AAueXjQ	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	I NEED MAJOR COMPUTER HELP!!pllllllzzzz..im begging!!!!!!!!?	There are many technologies available for networking computers together. You are quite sure that you will stick with TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) because it is by far the most common network protocol for residential and business use. However, you are not entirely certain that it is always the best solution.      Using all available resources, consider another networking protocol that could be used in place of TCP/IP. Detail some of the historic uses of it (or why it was created), and determine whether it is still used for those reasons.      In addition, answer the following questions:      Has TCP/IP replaced that protocol in the general usage, or did another protocol replace it?    Is TCP/IP used for everything, or are there any situations where it might not be used?    How does IPv6 relate to TCP/IP as it currently stands?

20090309090404AAb5SR7	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Algorithm for making an expression tree for mathematical functions?	Hi there,   Could someone describe to me the method/algorithm for taking an infix mathematical expression like:   (8 – (4 – 2) )* ( 4+(8 + 6) )      (assume this is input as a string)      And converting it into an expression tree? I cannot just use existing methods like python eval(), I need to implement this algorithm and it's driving me up the wall trying to figure out the logic ;)      I know that every parenthesis means another node deeper into the tree, I also know that the root nodes should all be operators, and only the leaves operands.      If it helps, I am coding this in Python with a binary tree class which I've already defined. If there are any particular methods the binary tree class requires for this (ie "new left node/right node(root node):") I can implement those if needed.      Thank you for your time; I can't find a conclusive answer through Google.

20090227150223AAMZaG9	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My external hard drive makes noise...?	I've had my external hard drive for a couple months over a year. Now it's making a noise and it has me worried.      When I turn on my external hard drive it makes an 'ERRR' sound like it's having trouble starting up. It stops shortly after though (the noise not the hard drive). Also, when it's running now it starts to make that sound again, only it's a couple of seconds. A couple of times when I've turned it on I heard a clicking sounds, but like the groan - it didn't last very long.      I have my external hard drive on nearly every day and for long hours. Could it be because I run it for too long every day or is it because I'm turning it on and off too much? I'm using 113GB of 232GB. For now I have it turned off and I'm letting it rest for a couple of days.

Problem is the users have to be able to write to this folder, and they do not have permsisions once the file was pushed to their machines. They can only read. Not write or remove.      How can this be fixed?

The problem is that he still thinks that all the top specs. will make his computer better, faster etc. than something that is "slighter" lower spec'd.      He said that he will be getting Snow Leopard with insanely high specification, like 8GB RAM etc.      I have told him that it's not worth it - it will go out-of-date quickly - as do all computer hardware.      Also he does NOT do any high-end video/encoding/editing or any other industrial-type of work. Only everyday use like email, internet, watching videos etc.      What can I do to stop him from spending over ￡2000 on a mac computer?      Much appreciated.

Easily the most irritating thing when typing a document in Word (2002 version) is when I’m in a hurry and inadvertently hit Ctrl+T instead of Shift+T. This throws out the formatting of the entire document into something ridiculous – Right Align or something that messes up all the lines. Why anyone would want to assign a shortcut to such a stupid format beats me. In any case, does anyone please know how I can get rid of this annoying shortcut – not just for a single document, but for all documents, for all time, for ever and ever. Please!

Hi      - what would typically be the difficulty criteria for a wordsearch puzzle? i.e. increasing number of words for a given grid size, increasing grid size for a given number of words, increasing number of words & grid size, increasing number of directions, etc.      - I need some guidance in generating the wordsearch grid itself; my current plan is to populate the grid by:   for each word in list   randomly pick one of 8 directions   randomly pick grid (x,y) location (appropriately limited by word length)   if overlapping letter(s) with existing word(s) foreseen:   if overlap works out place word and move onto next word in list   if overlap does not work out retry this word at different random direction and/or location up to a maximum of 10 times, then move onto next word.      ..... is there more efficient / effective algorithm to achieve the wordsearch grid generation? how is "effectiveness" defined in this case? ... am I looking to minimize/maximise word overlaps?

You can assume everything such as the main function, libraries etc are all written. Only need to write whats asked.       a) create a memory location called x and assign it to -3      would this just be x = -3;      b) create an array of 5 integers called w and assign the first value to 3 the thrid to 7 and the fourth to -5.      would this be      const int max =5;   w[max];   w[0]=3;   w[2]=7;   w[3]=-5;      I'm not sure how to do the others. not very confident with pointers.      c) Create an integer called p and assign it to memory location of x.      d) change the value of where p is pointing to 7 (using p)      e) Assign p to the first memory location of the array w and change the value of where p is pointing to -8.      f) Move p to the second location of the array w and assign 5 to that element.      g) Move p to the last location  of the array w and assign 12 to that element.      h) what are the values of x and all 5 elements in the array w?

You can assume everything such as the main function, libraries etc are all written. Only need to write whats asked.      a) Write a structure definition (new type definition) for a data structure that contains x, y, and z coordinates (all doubles); calling the new type coordinatesys.      here is what i thought      typedef struct {   double x;   double y;   double z;   } coordinatesys;      b) create an array of 20 coordinatesys'      here is what i thought      coordinatesys [20];      c) using a for loop, initialize all the x, y, and z in each of the 20 array elements to 0.      so i thought...      for (int i=0; i<20; i++)   {   x[i] = 0;   y[i] = 0;   z[i] = 0;   }      not sure about these three      d) Declare a pointer to the array and assign it to the third element in the array.      e) Using the pointer defined above, change the x value to -3.5 and the y value to 7.2      f) Using the new command ( and the pointer created above), create an array of coordinatesys' with 5 elements. No need to assign any values in the struct.      Thanks for all your help!

I'm trying to put in a header on an html page, with a fixed-width portion on the left (Image w/ company logo, etc), and a variable-width portion on the right (a repeating pattern).      I can't get this to work properly. Here's my current CSS:      #header {    margin-top:0px;   }   #headerleft {    width:1158px;    height:323px;    float:left;    background-image:url(../images/banner...    background-repeat:no-repeat;   }   #headerright {    float:left;    width:auto;    height:323px;    background-image:url(../images/banner...    background-repeat:repeat-x;   }      This doesn't work. The width:auto on headerright isn't making it fill the screen, instead it's getting no width at all.      I can't switch to purely percentage-based measurements, because that could skew the logo, but if I position things absolutely and use a precentage for the repeating portion, then it doesn't stop at the right edge of the page, and I get a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom.      What I need is:      (Large Monitor)   [Logo][Repeating][Repeating][Repeating...      (Small Monitor)   [Logo][Repeating][Repea]      Etc.      Any help is appreciated, I do choose best answers.

20090309130224AAsp0Tq	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My external hard drive does not appear on my “My computer” window.?	I just bought a HITACHI 1TB SERIAL ATA HD 7200/16 MB/SATA-3G hard drive.       I have it installed in a combo box with a USB connection. When I connect all this, the computer tells me that the hardware is found. The Hitachi appears on the Device Manager, but it does not appear on “My Computer” window so that I could format it.       The same thing happens if I connect the Hitachi on the second slot next to my regular hard drive, as a second internal hard drive. It is recognized on the Device Manager, but we do not see it anywhere else.       This Hitachi did not come with any driver disk. They say, on the Hitachi website, that all the computers have the necessary drivers to recognize the Hitachi hard drive. I have a Dell Dimension 5100, 3.0.      If I hook up any other hard drive (obviously already formatted) either on my combo USB or on the second internal slot, the hard drive appears on my computer window. So, I believe me issue that I need to format the Hitachi drive, but I cannot because I do not know where to find it, and use the right click drop down menu which allows me to format the disk.       Obviously, I am doing something wrong. I would appreciate any help.       Thanks in advance.

But when i plug it into the USB port, a light on the actual thumb drive blinks green. When i try to save something on the drive, i still can't find it.   Can i just not find the folder ect, or can i not see them because they were from a pc? But if that's the case shouldn't I be able to save things on the thumb drive?   (It's not the thumb drive. I can see the stuff on it when i plug it into other computers, though i haven't tried another mac.)

20090309145018AAbnfEw	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Username help please!?	Well, you see, YouTube's been removing my videos recently for audio infringement (=_=), and it seems like they're not deleting accounts for it (I mean, they've already removed 24 [I think it's something like that] and I haven't been suspended).  But I submitted a dispute today because it was a video that I REALLY liked, that I posted a long time ago and don't have on my computer anymore.  It was the song, plus an extra song, and my dispute was some BS like "It does not use the full song which is considered 'Fair Use' under U.S. copyright law," which has previously worked for me.  Anyway, my question isn't about if it'll work.  This is just some background information.      I need a backup account.  I already have one, but no one's subbing it, and I'm getting tired of the username.   I don't like numbers, and I don't want it to be insulting.   I was thinking about something like "Moonlit ___" or "____ Moonlight".  I want to have something that can be like double replacement.  For example, my first idea was "Moonlight Bloodbath", which, when I make an Intro for my videos, I could play with it and make it say "Bloodlit Moonbath" before it changes back, but 1. that doesn't make sense, and 2. it's kind of gory.      Can you help me come up with one that is dark, but not gory?  One that makes sense interchanging it?  Starlight could work as well as moonlight, or some other pretty image.  I've been thinking on it for a while, but I can't come up with anything good =(

20090309121252AAQZVTb	Computers & Internet;Security	Internet has been Capped is that because of illegal downloading?	Hey there!   I live in a shared house, and we have the internet from one of our house.   The internet was really slow, so he phoned the company and they said he's been capped.   He said to us, that he's been capped and registered now which means that whatever company he goes to they will know he's been capped.   However he also says that they registered this because of illegal downloading and he could give our IP adresses to them to find out who it was.      My Question is, does the capping has something to do if we might have been downloaded illegally?      thanks for the answers.

P.S. there are probably more people that dislike rants more than laziness...lol.  To you I apologize.

I told my mom that I wanted a mac for my birthday and she said "OK, I'll think about it" We started looking at mac prices and my mom said the same thing "I'll think about it. All right, I'm cool with that. So, two weeks later, my computer conveniently messes up. So I thought "Hello, Mac!" I tell my mom that my computer broke (and it really did, i didn't plan it) so, she said "All right, I'll order you a computer" so she calls me back and describes the DELL she just ordered...I said thanks, realizing 2 minutes later that my mom described a Dell to me. I was about to say "Mom, I wanted a Mac." when she told me she had to go. No offense, but I'm kinda mad. The Dell is to be shipped out in three days and I don't want to tell her now, cause if I do, I think she'll terminate the Dell order and not get me a computer at all. Please Help me! And I know, I sound spoiled, so don't you dare say ANYTHING about how spoiled this situation sounds. But, my friend and many people in Best Buy suggested a Mac for me because they saw how I knew what to do with it..(I've been on Macs before)

I mean I know I've done it three times.. but perhaps those times harmed my computer too? Or does it just reset, with no damaging functions?   I dont want to risk doing it a fourth time and damaging my computer beyond repair or something.

20090309143837AA2Uyf4	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	A C++ Expert please because I cannot solve it?	) Monte Carlo simulations are techniques that consist of choosing sample experiments at random from a large set and then making deductions on the basis of the probabilities estimated from the result of these experiments.  In this problem, you are to implement a Monte Carlo method for estimating the value of π. Consider the first quadrant of a unit circle centered at (0,0). This quarter circle lies inside a unit square. A point with coordinates (x,y) is inside the quarter circle iff x2 + y2 <= 1. The area of the quarter circle region can be estimated by picking, at random, points (x,y) that lie in the unit square, and for each point determining whether the point lies in the region.  The fraction of points that fall in the region should give an estimate of π/4 (ratio of the area of the region and the area of the enclosing unit square). Multiplying by 4 gives an estimate of π. Write a program that takes a command line integer parameter N and prints an estimate of π using N random points as described above.  How good are the estimates with N = 10, 100, 10000?

20090309144155AAOL6Xt	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	During a lack of responsiveness, I pressed the standby button, and when that didn't work, I turned it off...?	I have never experienced such a problem, and this is a serious one:      My computer was not responding to anything I did, because for some reason my internet page, which was one on imdb.com, was replicating itself several times.  When nothing responded save for the option to shut down the computer, I chose to put the computer on standby.  When nothing happened after this, again a lack of responsiveness, I manually turned off the PC by pressing the button in.  After a minute or so I turned the PC back on and it showed me the window with options to "Start Windows normally" etc., basically when I picked an option, nothing would happen for about 10 seconds and then the "resuming windows" screen with a grey bar at the bottom of the screen appeared, the windows loading screen would appear for about 4 seconds and then it would disappear, following this the computer would start again and offer me the screen with options such as "start windows normally", again!  This cycle would continue and even now, even if I turn off the computer or unplug the computer completely, the cycle will not go away and I cannot use the computer.  What is happening, and how can I stop the cycle and get the computer to work?  Is it because I pressed 'Standby'?!

20090309145629AA2miAL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop monitor didn't work, now it's working again? help!!!?	So, I went to class this morning with my laptop "sleeping" and when I came home, I went to wake it up or whatever. It froze at the login screen, so I had to turn it off using the power button. I went to turn it back on and the screen was black, wouldn't work, but the computer was making its usual starting up noises. I tried this a bunch of times and nothing happened. Then, I went and took it apart and wiggled a bunch of stuff, and I took out the battery and went to turn it back on. Voila, it works.      Any insight? I don't really think the wiggling did much, but does anyone know about laptops enough to give me an idea as to what happened and if it can/will happen again?
