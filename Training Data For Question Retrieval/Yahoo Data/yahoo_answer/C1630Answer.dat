HziXc5Ovaa	All countries allow Cubans to enter their country. But you will always need your updated passport to enter other countries Mexico and Canada (maybe even Jamaica) are just a few of the countries that are perhaps not as expensive...although these days with the recession, things are not all inexpensive. But it's liveable in these places.<br>  <br>  However, to be able to do that, you would need to be sponsored by family or friends from the country you would be going to. <br>  <br>  Or of course you would be able to go if the Cuban government allowed you to leave for work/educational purposes.|`|6R9McFZhaa	I think go to mexico and later cross to US ,I don't know|`|jVW3Zxckaa	None. <br>  <br>  To leave Cuba you need, besides the visa, the authorization of the Cuban government to leave and that is not so easy to obtain as you think|`|LlfLa4Twaa	Cuba!|`|SeJ1Hnfraa	Hello dear<br>  A cuban citizen can visit<br>  Ecuador<br>  Haiti<br>  St Lucia<br>  Grenada<br>  Barbados<br>  Singapore<br>  Malaysia<br>  Russia<br>  Ghana<br>  Burkina faso<br>  and some other countries VISA FREE for periods between 30-90days with their valid passport<br>  but they still need an EXIT permit from the Cuban Government even if the country where they plan to visit doesn't require them an entry visa.In order to get this exit permit they must apply weeks in advance and have an invitation letter from a citizen or resident of the country they will visit.DEpending on who they are and what their track record in Cuba is this will help or not help when getting the exit permit.Usually normal people with no police records or opposition to the government get this easier.Its truly hard to get these exit permits for Cuban Doctors and children under 18.<br>  My advice is to start the process early since it can take weeks/months to process<br>  Good Luck!!!

AA11326712	With about 14 000 towns and villages in South Africa, there are very few town with only 4 letters that end in a "p".<br>  <br>  There is Camp near Groblersdal, Kamp near Aliwal North and Goop near Nababeep.<br>  <br>  As others have mentioned, there is the nickname for Cape Town, Kaap.  And the only other could be De Hoop.<br>  <br>  If you merely wish to know what a "village" or "town" is called in Afrikaans, which is one of South Africa′s 11 official languages, then the Afrikaans word would be "dorp". "Dorp" means "town", a village would be a "dorpie".|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	Any of the hundreds of places ending in "dorp" which is Afrikaans for town. e.g. Villiersdorp|`|1AHxTBDUaa	Are you sure the question isn't actually asking for the Afrikaans word for "village"?<br>  Then the answer is "dorp"|`|zEoRcL91aa	Dorp means village in Afrikaans, so you may have trouble, as everyone refers to a small place as a dorp. Am I on the right track?<br>  <br>  A lot of villages also have the name spruit of fontein in them, which means fountain or spring and was the reason why people stopped there.<br>  <br>  You also get a few cities with dorp at the end like Klerksdorp.|`|E855dvZdaa	Are you maybe thinking about Cape Town, some people call it "Die Kaap"<br>  <br>  The town thing is completely correct, in Afrikaans a town is a dorp. So you get a lot of places that end with dorp.<br>  <br>  There are no other towns that has a four letter name ending with p, maybe it has more letters? Sonop? Or ends with a s and you thought it was plural? Kapps?|`|fLMCOSWdaa	Well, if I remember right, the Dutch word for village is dorp, so I think you will have plenty to choose from.|`|3I3QcjQjaa	you should probably look in the western cape  coz i know every village in eastern cape and durban|`|OWoytzEEaa	Krugersdorp|`|3FmcSiMkaa	Dorp|`|AA12340290	im sure theres alot

Councillors will either meet you in their home or come to yours, and also they have "surgeries" in different parts of their ward regularly.|`|118bff446d15f485ea24e6f3b6cc6af2aa	If you are in a city or town, their surgery is likely to be held at a Party office or in a community centre, perhaps once a month or once a fortnight. You might need an appointment. If you are in a rural area, a surgery is more likely to be held at the council offices or in a nearby village hall. It is more likely to be a monthly opportunity there.

A lot of mishaps occur, and the extra time helps if you do get lost in the airport or if security checks take a toll. Ask workers at the airport which directions to go to get to your flight's portal; they shouldn't give you any trouble or anything like that. Have passports and whatnot ready, and make sure things in your suitcases and bags are super organized. It makes security checks go by a lot faster.<br>  <br>  Well, that's all I know to tell you but I've flown many times. Hope I helped!

The service is excellent.  The aircraft average around 6 years of age.  There is really good in-flight entertainment.  The food is not bad.  Also they are in the Star Alliance so even though I do not have a Singapore Airlines frequent flier account, I can earn miles on United Airlines.|`|7IDiWZfkaa	KLM!!!!!<br>  <br>  KLM is definately one of the best if not best airline.

AleT38EYaa	What do you want to know?  Are you planning on moving there?  <br>  <br>  Louisvillians are different than people from other parts of Kentucky.  The hick jokes generally don't apply, and no one's parents are cousins.  <br>  <br>  I hate the hot, humid summers.  I hate the people who think Louisville is the only/best place in the world to live . . . there is a lot of cool stuff out there!  <br>  <br>  I love the Bardstown Rd area, and the proximity to the mountains and beautiful countryside.  <br>  <br>  The West End and the Shively Area are pretty dodgy.  Also, Bullitt County is pretty creepy.  <br>  <br>  As for the people, most people never move, except for college.  There are quite a few people from the "boonies" who think Louisville is "the big city" (they've never been to Chicago).  There are a fair number of worldly, traveled, educated people who give the city diversity and some spice.  <br>  <br>  One quirky fact is that "Happy Birthday to You" was written in Louisville at the Little Loomhouse in Iroquois Park.
AA12095483	For a three day trip? The smallest one would be plenty big enough unless you are going to a formal event and have to pack a tux.|`|Pa4uek59aa	I'd say the smallest one! You shouldn't need that much room unless you are going to a formal event. Also- to save room, try rolling your clothes, or putting socks inside of your shoes. Have fun! Hope I helped!!! :)|`|8Ol5p57oaa	Before I would answer you, I would ask the purpose of the trip which would dictate the type of clothes you need to take.  If you are taking a casual trip, I would agree that the smallest bag is sufficient---a couple of pairs of jeans, couple shirts, undies, and toiletries.  If it's a business trip where you have to take a suit, you might want to consider a garment style bag and a small carry on.  You have plenty of options so that's good.  My other advice is to try this for packing to make sure you are not overloaded or over weight restrictions.  Pack everything you think you need then take everything out and re-pack as if you can only take half of what you originally had.  People always take too much on trips and usually find that they have not used half of what they took after they have returned home.  Try it!|`|TkgdTMgBaa	The smallest one, with the added bonus that you won't need to check it in, you can take it on as hand luggage|`|kTVQ4QeGaa	whichever one you can fit all your stuff in......<br>  The smallest one would probably do it.|`|2BatkpPtaa	id say the 2nd one<br>  <br>  45+ litres|`|buIrjxI1aa	For 3 days, the smallest one should be fine, unless you're planning to bring gifts back from your trip.

These sim cards will work in any un-locked GSM cell phone (you can use yours if you already have one, or get a low cost sim & cell bundle from them). This is not only the best way to avoid expensive International roaming, it is the most cost effective way to stay connected while abroad. <br>  <br>  Best part is you will know you local phone number even before you leave the Country, incoming calls are free & you pay your bills in local currency (usd).

PSiNv7gUaa	If there is a thunderstorm over the airports you are taking off from or landing at, then your flight may be delayed.  Most storms pass within half an hour to an hour, then your flight can take off.  If the weather is too bad to land safely at your destination airport, then the plane will either enter a holding pattern or land at another airport.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry if it's going to be storming in the states you're flying over.  When I flew to Florida from Missouri last year, the entire Tennessee valley was covered in thunderstorms, and we flew well above them.  There were some large clouds extending far up into the sky from those storms, but we flew around them.  We experienced some turbulence, but nothing major.  Remember that no matter what the weather's like on the ground, it's always sunny above the clouds!<br>  <br>  Also, if for some reason you are flying level with thunderstorms and see lightening that looks close by, don't be afraid.  Clouds magnify lightening, so even though it might look like it's close, it could be as far as 50 miles away.  Lightening is not dangerous to airplanes, if you can see the wings where your seat is, check for the little rods sticking out...  These are the static discharge wicks and help direct the lightening away from the plane if the plane is struck (which again, is not a problem, planes are designed to withstand lightening).  And even more comforting is the fact that both air traffic control AND most planes are equipped with radar and other weather tracking devices, so they can avoid severe weather very easily.  Relax and have a great time, flying is fun!!|`|Pa4uek59aa	Thunderstorms can effect the plane ride, but shouldn't effect the time you take off/ land. But, that depends on the "degree" of the thunderstorm. As for the flight experience, I am sure you have heard that you should chew some gun on take off, and landing. And, make sure that if you are the kind of person that easily gets motion sickness, you have the right medicine that helps you. Also- it is a good idea to check your airline website to see their policy on carryon items. For example: most airlines have a policy on how many ounces a liquid can be on your carryon, and that you have to put the liquid items in a plastic baggie! Also- the plane food isn't that great, so pack some of your favorite dry foods, and remember not to eat anything too greasy or have a big meal 24 hours proir to your flight. Also, arrive at the airport ahead of time- there is nothing worse than getting their late- as if their isn't enough stress at the airport! And lastly, make sure your bags are organized, so incase of a luggage search, you are "good to go." Have a great trip! Hope I helped!|`|jbJvTUfPaa	Thunderstorms can make a plane bobble around much like a car on a bumpy road.  If you encounter this, close your eyes and sit back and try to relax - it helps to close your eyes, or at least it helps me when I encounter turbulence.  Do not drink alcohol before the flight - the effects are doubled after you climb over 5.000 feet - so if you get tipsy on the ground, you'll be sh*t-faced on the plane - maybe even sleep it off on the plane....<br>  <br>  Most of the larger planes flying will vector around the rough weather or fly over it - so you may never encounter even a bump - good luck!|`|1CJGUS55aa	plane rides can be scary, and i wont lie about that, especially on your first time.<br>  <br>  i strongly recommend chewing gum, especially when going up, and for the first 15 minutes to reduce ear popping.<br>  <br>  relax, calm down, take deep breaths, bring a small stuffed animal to squeeze if nervous<br>  <br>  the ride may be bumpy and maybe jittery. relax. look outside at the clouds and sun, think of a happy memory or place<br>  <br>  im 13 so i dont know if my age affects anything but i hope not. god luck and relax.|`|J0tdTB84aa	planes usually fly above the weather if im not mistaken. but if your plane goes through the storm, it'll probably hit some turbulence. shaking around a bit, some jerky lifts and falls. but nothing too bad.|`|SLzHDTmzaa	U can hit some turbulance

ZPxJNpMxaa	There are certain facts, our crime rate is relatively high, we have the statistics to prove it and cannot wish them away, furthermore there is high corruption and bribery within our police services.<br>  <br>  But there are other facts, the number of visitors to our shores are on the increase and most tourists do a little research before traveling to a country. Secondly, we are hosting the soccer world cup in 2010 and have hosted cricket and rugby world cups in the past without major incident.<br>  <br>  So in my view, your decision should not be whether to come to SA or not, you should capitalize on an opportunity to travel to one of the most beautiful countries in the world, but rather to gather information of the things to do and not to do to minimize your chance of becoming a victim of crime.<br>  <br>  In this regard, safety in SA, is a regularly asked question on this forum and I strongly recommend that search for and read them and memorize the useful advice.

ejbSFv0caa	Like many Cities Manchester has problmes<br>  <br>  NO area is problme free , however Didsbury is a borderline area.  High student content ensures that muggings etc are likely to reamin higher than other areas - so not safe to walk at night.<br>  <br>  The proximity to large areas of low level housing means drug availability is high too so another reason to try and avoid being out at night.<br>  <br>  South Manchester IS improving slowly - but until the Tram is linked properly it will always be a transport backwater and commuting a real hassle.  Schools wise ,forget it! Dedicated teachers stick at the job whilst the credit goes to Heads of dubious character who know how to play the game.<br>  <br>  However, there are gems.  Marie Louise Gardens is a lovely quiet little park with freindly squirrels and lots of memorial trees.  It can have problme visitors but I've only seen a few in years of visiting.<br>  <br>  The housing near there is better and there are quiet leafy roads too<br>  For schooling you may have difficulty.  The 'improving' schools are often not what they are made out to be -bright kids still get too little help too late.  Too much is spent on trying to bribe trainee thugs to attend - then they lower the bar.<br>  <br>  Look at areas just outside the City, so  long as you use the motorway cameras to view your routes to work to ensure it stays reasonable at teh times you would travel, then coupled with other crime statistics you should choose a home that is within teh catchment area of the schools you want your children to attend<br>  expect housing prices to heavily reflect that though!

z0XRuVwSaa	the quay side is nice and also the gate in central newcastle|`|LgNqYUECaa	Quayside..<br>  Eldon Square.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	In the city centre itself, there's the Quayside, and also the Grainger Town area (the Victorian city centre) located between the river and Grey's Monument.<br>  <br>  However, relatively few people live in these areas. Yes, some people do live in the city centre, but not as many as live in the suburbs.<br>  <br>  If you want a good community life, you want to look slightly outside the city centre, in suburbs like Gosforth and Jesmond. These are leafy residential areas with lots of large Victorian terraced houses and (in Gosforth) some huge detached mansions as well.<br>  <br>  Jesmond has more of a young student vibe, with lots of trendy bars and restaurants, whereas Gosforth has more older folk and families living there.|`|062b58d93f3fd328d983b9234c24d64eaa	Jesmond and Gosforth are the best and very central.

There is lots of places outwith Newcasle town that you should consider if moving to the area, the transport links are great.

pIvN6TY7aa	The most valuable product coming from British Columbia (more valuable than all other agriculture production, petroleum & mining activities, and the forestry industried COMBINED!) is what we call "BC Hydro".<br>  <br>  Geography permitting generation of abundant hydro-electric power has been a valuable natural BC resource.  That's why, to take a conspicuous example, bauxite has been transported (mostly) from Jamaica, in the Caribbean, to Kitimat, on the northern BC coast. (Refining bauxite to make aluminum takes a lot of electricity.) <br>  <br>  Another important natural resource in BC is many highly-creative, well-educated people. (I believe that in Nelson, BC. an anniversary memorial has been erected honouring the Draft Dodgers of the 1960-70s. They brought ideas and attitudes that have turned some pretty banal areas into charming communities - which were, until recently, being bought up by 'Merkin pensioners. But I digress ...) Some of them have been gifted geneticists and botanists.<br>  <br>  The use of electricity likely to produce the greatest economic return is to power "grow ops".  (That's why, for example, at the "Cannabis Cup",  held in Amsterdam every year, "BC Hydro" is a good thing.)<br>  <br>  As far as competition between countries above and below the "longest undefended border in the world" (which has acquiesced to US "No Fly" orders, and now has bombers belonging to the Untied States flying over without anyone noting it seriously), differences in drug attitudes and policies in the two nations result in very significant economic and social results. <br>  <br>  In BC, legal enforcement at all levels has realized that if they tried to put all people who posessed and/or dealt in small quantities of cannabis into jail (as seems to be the case in some parts of the US), they'd have to put the rest of the population to work in "corrections". Although the laws are still on the books, only under unusual circumstances would a person be charged for anything but major operations.  Drug enforcement resources have been directed more to heroin, cocaine, and "meth". One very ominous result is that in the US, it costs about as much to buy marijuana as cocaine.  In Canada, cannabis is relatively inexpensive. So for the price of half a dozen beer, you have three or four dozy people rummaging in the refrigerator.<br>  I think it would be worth looking at the relative rates of assault, homicide, automobile and other accidents, in relation to the two nations and their drug policies.  But again, I digress.<br>  <br>  You didn't ask for me to do your homework for you, and (obviously!), I haven't.  But I think you got something that I would give an "A" to, as a simple research paper!<br>  <br>  Learning is sweet!|`|fscgp7iFaa	Water, oil, dairy, Canola oil, wheat, salmon, corn, beef, gold, diamonds, other fish, lumber, turism and (although I'm ashamed to say it) Quebec makes maple surup.|`|AA11617573	Well, just wikipedia it. <br>  <br>  but if you want to know:<br>  <br>  British Columbia - lumber, hydropower, salmon and other fish<br>  Alberta- crude oil, wheat, beef, lumber<br>  Saskatchewan - potash (50% of the world), crude oil, natural gas, wheat, grains, canola oil, lumber,uranium<br>  <br>  Manitoba -  grain<br>  Ontario -  tree fruit, nickel, dairy <br>  Quebec - dairy, hydro, iron ore<br>  New Brunswick - potato, lobster, lumber, forestry products<br>  Nova Scotia - gyspum, lobster, lumber, forestry products, salt, coal (at one time), natural gas, tidal power<br>  <br>  Prince Edward Island - potatoe<br>  Newfoundland - crude oil, metal ores, hydro,
YvNCOYZZaa	Full fare tickets usually allow you to cancel them for a full refund.  You would then rebook with your new date.  There's no guarantee that it will be the same price.  <br>  <br>  There are limited restriction tickets where you can change or cancel for a fee.  <br>  <br>  Calling the airline directly is the best way to get answers.  You can also try to look up your reservation online to see what the restrictions are and what your options are. No need to go to the airport.  Nagging will not help.  The policies are clearly stated when you book the ticket.  <br>  <br>  If your flight is cancelled, the airline is much more flexible on when you can use that ticket.  They will often allow you to rebook up to a year after the date of purchase.  <br>  <br>  Weather is not the airline's responsibility.  I just recently had a flight cancelled due to weather.  The airline rebooked us on the next flight (the next AM) and they gave us a coupon so that we could get 'distressed traveler' rates at a local hotel.
PA0bGBtCaa	Yes, there are tickets out there that are not-flexible. But you can still cancel the trip, and you can still change the date of travel. The type of ticket you purchased will just determine how much money you have to pay to do any of that stuff.<br>  <br>  Your scenario 1: You will be able to change the date of your trip, however, you will have to pay an airline change fee (usually $100) plus any difference in air fare. It would be really expensive! More flexible airline tickets would simply allow you to either not pay the change fee, or not pay any of the fees. However, those fares are really expensive. And you can cancel those refundable anytime tickets for a full refund!<br>  <br>  Your scenario 2: This is ALL dependent on the airline you are flying on what they will do for you in this situation. For instance, the airline I work for would allow you to rebook your travel for up to three days out, or give you a refund if your flight was cancelled due to weather. Not all airlines are like that. Yes, some will rebook you to the next available flight, but that's it. They will not give you a refund. Some of their computer systems simply will not allow a certain fare class to be refunded!<br>  <br>  And finally, no, the airline is not responsible for weather cancellations. They choose to cancel their flights because of SAFETY reasons. Did you hear about that Continental plane that crashed in Buffalo? It's reasons like that why airlines tend to not fly into certain weather conditions. No they do not give you hotel rooms, vouchers for meals, and car rentals. Think of how much money they are losing when they have to cancel a flight. But they are not losing nearly as much as they would if they had to pay out families due to a crash in the weather. You cannot control the weather, so it's always something you have to be prepared to deal with when you plan your trips.|`|VlhmbHGGaa	I don't know what's wrong with Daniel F, he keeps repeating the same questions for months now.<br>  <br>  If permitted to change of a ticket (and possibly fee) is in the rules of the ticket. Ask the airline, just call customer service. It's impossible to answer your question without knowing what kind of ticket you have purchased.<br>  <br>  As a general rule: cheap tickets are impossible or at least expensive to change.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Oy....this kid seems to be asking the same question over and over until he gets an answer that HE likes.<br>  <br>  Unless someone has found a way to control the weather, the airline is NOT responsible for weather delays!!!

U0vr7T6laa	In Kenya, a lot of money is being brought in due to tourism.. Everybody who has the money wants to spend thousands of US dollars to go on Safari.  Kenya is a beautiful country with beautiful people.  A little over a year ago, there were the presidential elections. The incumbent president was re-elected by a slim margin.<br>  <br>  The losing candidate, did not take it sitting down.  He still wanted to be president.   This caused conflicts between two or more tribes.  That resulted in riots and over 1000 people being killed.<br>  This did cut down on tourism. Now with the economic crisis hitting the world-  less travel is being done to Africa and especially Kenya.<br>  The airfares are very high at this time, since there is about a $500 to $700 fuel surcharge being imposed on each ticket coming from the US.|`|7cUDstdjaa	A benefit, it brings money into the country and creates a fair bit of employment.|`|RILZcr6Daa	Kindly check on resolved questions in kenya.You will find lots of answers for this type of question|`|yPfxcIb9aa	it's a bit of both really- it benefits certain areas (such as Nairobi and Mombasa), but most of the villages do not see any benefit from tourism, as a result, they are still living a life of poverty.<br>  <br>  some cultures are being taken away from them, e.g. the Masai are not allowed to take their livestock into some areas due to tourism- yet if they are nomads, then that is being restricted. Also, some of the masai villages are being opened up to the tourists- to some extent, this is good as it shows people their way of life, yet with this, they are making their lifestyle into a tourist attraction, and are losing some of their traditions to the way of the West.<br>  <br>  As there are more tourists entering Kenya, this means that there is an increasing amount of transport (planes, buses, cars etc.) which results in a higher pollution percentage, endangering the flora and polluting the rivers. More vehicles are invading upon the National Parks resulting in the wildlife being disturbed. Many of the wildlife are also being hunted- mainly by people from the West, which then puts a strain on the species- elephants were nearing extinction, and the numbers are only just gradually increasing.<br>  <br>  More tourists = potentially more beggars, I don't mean to sound horrible here, but it is true. If you look at it from their perspective, they can most likely get more money from begging than they could from a job. Of course, there are genuine beggars, but you can also get 'professional beggars'.<br>  <br>  Yet, many craftsmen do benefit from tourists who are looking to buy traditional gifts in Kenya- which some of this money could reach some of the villages.<br>  <br>  In order for the whole country to benefit, it will take many years, but they will have to be careful not to destroy a beautiful country.|`|zEoRcL91aa	For animals, it is a benefit, as people will go to greater lengths to preserve wildlife.<br>  As for social problems like sex tourism, child abuse etc, HIV is a major problem, and travelling perverts aren't helping, but I think it is good for both tourists and locals to meet each other, as there can be a good cultural exchange.

Your birthday is based on the day the ship sets sail so even if you turn 21 on the ship, you can't drink on the ship.  Though you are only turning 18 so I'm not sure why he would even falsify it in the first place.<br>  <br>  All your documentation will be checked.

I will go in Rome in this month (I hope) in tre hours by train I'm in Rome... and I am very happy when I go around the city! I think it's the best city of the world. I highly recommend that you go from the Colosseum to the Altar of the Fatherland in Piazza Venezia, on foot through the beautiful Imperial Forums! And then go absolutely into the Church of St. Peter and salts on the dome (cupola) where you can admire the incredible panorama! Congratulations on your choice!|`|RX13yzwsaa	For to visit the Galleria Borghese, you require reservation on 0632810.<br>  But there are many other place in Rome where don't require reservation and is beautiful.<br>  For example: <br>  -Villa Borghese<br>  -Via Del Corso (centr of Rome)<br>  -Church of S.

97sKOWQ0aa	5 Top Running Tracks in Atlanta<br>  <br>  1. South: Reynolds Nature Preserve, Morrow, Clayton County<br>  The preserve has over four miles of dirt and wood chip trails. The large outer loop is a mile and a half. It passes two lakes, a pond, and a small creek and has a serious incline on the southwest side. This thickly wooded park keeps the sun at bay in the hot Atlanta summers and abates the winter breezes. It’s a real gem.<br>  <br>  2. North: Roswell Riverwalk, Roswell, Fulton County<br>  This flat paved path snakes five miles along the Chattahoochee River, through parks and neighborhoods. It’s a great place to do speed workouts. City planners intend to connect this fabulous path to the Alpharetta Greenway, another terrific linear park for exercise enthusiasts in north Atlanta.<br>  <br>  3. West: Silver Comet Trail, Smyrna, Cobb County<br>  Soon to be an interstate path, the Silver Comet Trail (SCT) was built over railroad tracks. The trail currently provides over 30 miles of paved path. The SCT winds through beautiful landscapes. Many inline skaters, walkers, and bikers share this superb course with runners, so be sure to use proper passing etiquette.<br>  <br>  4. East: Stone Mountain Park, DeKalb County, Stone Mountain<br>  A 1.3 mile trail leads to the top of the mountain. You can jog up and down, but I don’t advise you make this your first mountain run. It’s steep in several places, and you’ll need appropriate shoes for the changing terrain. Otherwise the mountain park hosts a great selection of running possibilities. There are nature trails and the road around the base of the mountain is five miles in length. Albeit all paved, the scenery while rounding the mountain is astounding and well worth the trip.<br>  <br>  5. Midtown: Piedmont Park, Atlanta, Fulton County<br>  Atlanta’s central park has as fine mix of tar and turf for runners. The Atlanta Track Club has provided several water fountains in the park, making it easy to stay hydrated in the heat and humidity well known to Atlanta. If you prefer city streets, then take a turn around the perimeter of the park. It’s a nice 5K with sidewalks all the way.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Every public High School has a track that is free and open to the community as long as the school isn't using it.  <br>  <br>  You can't interupt a soccer game or track practice and you can't use it during school hours but in the evening they are available to use.|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Just about any of the high school or middle school tracks in Dekalb county are open to public.

y0T5V7hIaa	I've never been to Pakistan but I have traveled to the middle east.  I would just remind you to take extra precautions if you do go.  It really isn't the best time to go to pakistan (the recent terror attacks).  The State Department has issued a warning about traveling to Pakistan in Feb.2009.  Also be aware that Pakistan is a muslim country (97% Muslim)  so it is important that you dress in a way that will be appropriate.  Register with the U.S. embassy when you arrive.  Since your boyfriend is from pakistan you should be able to get around safely since he has family there and knows the country.<br>  <br>  Pakistani food is spicy and good, food such as Tandoori/Barbecue, Lentils, Rice Dishes, all kinds of bread such as Chapatis is popular, round flat bread pretty common in most households.  <br>  <br>  Many foreigners who travel abroad experience food poisoning or water related poising.  Try to go to your doctor before you travel to get medicine or shots before you travel to avoid getting sick. <br>  <br>  Be careful and I hope you have a great time.|`|t6MHAb55aa	unfortuntely mardan is not a very very safe place.it is noted that Pakistan armed forces are facing tough resistance in that area.Pakistan army holds army cantt area in peshwer where their top army cammand lives and that area is safe.here are list of pakistan most secure cities:<br>  1.rawalpindi(the chaklala army cantt, the army security zone).<br>  2.islamabad( e-7 sector islamabad where pakistan most important people live).<br>  3.karachi(malir cantt).<br>  ----<br>  4.peshwer(army security zone cantt)(khyber road zone)<br>  ----<br>  5.mardan(dangerous)<br>  1= most secure ,  4=least securem, 5=danger zone.<br>  <br>  if u still decide to go to mardan , please let me know first.|`|AA10523012	How do you want to visit this man's family without being married?

168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	Most of the public beaches can be very crowded during "peak", or average weather (which we have nearly all year round depending on the amount of coolness a person's body can withstand), weekends and holidays or school holidays, March and April are spring breaks locally for 4 types of schools, community college, USF, UT, and then later Public K-12.<br>  <br>  Sadly, people will head to the beach and step over dead fish (gross, I KNOW!) during red tide. These persons are not always tourist but silly locals.<br>  <br>  But if you want to avoid the crowds, Caladesi Island is great and it's near enough to Tampa.<br>  <br>  If you prefer the crowds, Any St. Pete or Clearwater beach can be decently crowded and of course there are nude beaches and beaches for those of an "alternative lifestyle", which stay constantly crowded.

We get a lot of American crap here though.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Most of what I can think of is food -- and Customs confiscate **all** food at the airport in Sydney.  They do sometimes let commercially packaged stuff go through, if it's been cooked, for example.  Do your family folks like canned clam chowder?  Australians seem not to have any kind of history with clam chowder.  Oddly enough, there's cinnamon there, but cinnamon flavored foods aren't a tradition (cinnamon buns are uncommon, cinnamon candies, gum, and mouthwash, etc, are almost unheard-of).  Aussie Customs might let breakfast cereals through, except for oatmeal or meusli kinds, and the like.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many electronics items are not compatible with Australian systems.<br>  <br>  Legos are available in Australia, but are horrendously expensive.  So if you have a lego-lover, one of the larger sets would be most welcome.<br>  <br>  Many European goods, if they're available in Sydney at all, are horrendously expensive.  I can't help with those, though, except to mention that many European magazines are appreciated -- so see if your family wants things like that.<br>  <br>  Internet shopping has been a huge boost to the variety of goods available in Australia.  The best thing you can do is ask your family if there is anything they particularly miss from the US.  You don't have to make promises as to bringing anything, even -- just ask.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Enjoy your trip!  -- And do try the walk over the Sydney Harbour Bridge when you get there.  It's spectacular!  -- And visit Taronga Zoo -- it's got the best views in the world for any zoo -- and an excellent platypus house.  And Darling Harbour -- make sure you watch some of the buskers there (street performers, who do their performances for money donations) -- they're some of the best in the world.  The Chinese Garden is excellent, too -- very serene, in the middle of a major city! -- the restaurant and the tea house are both very pricey, but very good food.  The Opera House, well, of course.  The Capital Theatre is fun, too -- international companies perform there, and the decor is bizarre, vintage, and terrific!<br>  <br>  Oh.   :-D    Enjoy your trip -- you wouldn't be the first!    :-D|`|OMYd6p3gaa	Definitley an I <3 NY T-shirt!

Even if you book a cruise and it happens that a major hurricane is headed to your selected route, they will change the ports your ship visits to avoid the storm; and passenger safety is their first concern.

If your cruise price goes down after you pay for it, you'll get a refund for the difference.|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	lo yeah hurricanes = nice  cruises!!   are you  for real?   75 + mph winds at sea?     thats just category 1   cat 5 is over 150-200 mph winds.     that kind of wind will make 10-25 foot waves  ... great for surfers  not so great for  big cruise ships<br>  <br>  just because only 4 to 6 hurricanes  make landfall  there are  15 or more every year that  we dont hear about that  they track but stay out to sea.   hurricane season runs from june to nov  with the most action running from late aug to late oct.   <br>  <br>  <br>  to answer your question reember the old proverb... you get what you pay for.   if the cruises were "just as nice"   you would  have to pay..."just as much"|`|uV54p794aa	Yes, you deduced correctly,,, October is hurricane season. It actually starts Sept 1 for the carribean.  My brother decided to get married in St Thomas in September (1996 if I remember correctly) Hurricane Marilyn came through & levelled the island. They've had him & his wife on tv shows Hardcopy,Stormstories,  news one and a whole slew of other ones,, His part is "Hurricane Honeymoon" Hey I warned him.... But on a cruise, they will just change your port of call, or go to another island instead of heading for a hurricane... It's rare, but it happens. I wouldnt worry...|`|VZRJZQxKaa	We went on a cruise last October and had wonderful weather. We took an Eastern Caribbean cruise. The week after we went a Hurricane went through the same path as our cruise. We are going on another cruise next November. Its also a great time because all the kids are in school so you don't have a cruise with lots of children

Besides this, after u retire u get a good amount of money for ur whole life. Salaries are very very high compared to most countries. And the best thing is that job is not generally that stressing. It's like a paradise.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's very expensive, more expensive than many other countries, generally more expensive than the US and all the other european countries, maybe it's as expensive as Japan or close, depens also on the city u r in.

We went out and went to a few places that were ok and walked around with all the other people clubbing and pubbing that night ( we did enter a nightclub that was very black and a few of the guys felt a bit intimidated so we only stayed 30mins!..funny)<br>  <br>  Anyway it was not until after our return I then heard that Nottingham had a high crime rate/murders etc!! I have to say I was a bit shocked but I did not see it...however I was there for one night and a day! Anyplace has its ups and downs I guess.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Yeah it's alright if you want to get shot.

I think the transport network is pretty goods there, but it does have a very high crime rate yes.<br>  A mix of good and bad like everywhere these days|`|hktbfRPWaa	Depends where abouts you live in Nottingham. Some areas are rough and have higher crime rates, but most of Nottingham is fine. There are lots of shops in the city centre and the price is average. Certainly not over-priced overall (unless you chose to shop at a place which has has expensive designer clothing or something)<br>  <br>  In the centre of Nottingham I should think the night life is pretty good, same as most cities I should think. There is a fair amount to do in Nottingham and the people are alright usually.<br>  <br>  There is lots of transports. Buses, taxi, trams and the train. All pretty good and gives you a choice of how you want to travel.|`|803d7a60e642d4a568204ac15d119dd0aa	I heard that too about the crime rate but I'm not sure how true that is!!<br>  <br>  I think the night life is good, the general town is historic and interesting and it's quite a busy business area. The price of things is at an average level of any midland area.<br>  <br>  I have heard some ouskirt areas like Loughborough are rough despite having an excellent University.<br>  <br>  Have no comment on the people - just seem normal.|`|LcRKHa0Gaa	Ok that category is rank and has nothing to do with Nottingham.<br>  Anyways,<br>  I went there for like a trip and it was a very peaceful place. Like with the woods and stuff. I mean if you have a dog, then get a house near a wood - YOU WILL HAVE THE LIFE MAN!!!! <br>  It just has a high crime rate cos its a big place. Nothing to worry about really!<br>  I hope everything goes well!|`|HclZKkMVaa	It's gun capital of the UK - I'm serious by the way. It's got the highest rate of gun crime in the entire UK.<br>  My mum's side of the family live in Nottingham and they seem to like it. The shopping's fab!<br>  I wouldn't know much else as I don't live there but you'll find the same things wherever you go.|`|8JPDOXagaa	Its a big city.. bound to have a high crime rate.<br>  Its no more dangerous than any other big towns around here tbh.<br>  <br>  Nice shops, great nightlife.<br>  You should check it out for yourself|`|O5KOwhovaa	It's fine.<br>  <br>  All major cities have high crime rates|`|FHRfTlCxaa	I love Nottingham,shops are quite nice.. :)|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	erm its kind of gangsta place|`|PTyinkf6aa	YEH YEH YEH YEH!<br>  <br>  the whole lesbian thing is great!|`|bDJ5cJ8Gaa	ummm k where IS nottingham????!!!!|`|tLBjsrEFaa	yes tell Robin Hood I said hi|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	It's a nice city with lots of cool things to do, the downside is that there is a serious gun culture.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	I don't know about your suggested category, Im not about the level of gay people here.<br>  <br>  I've lived here since Oct and I have not seen any crime, it is whether you place yourself in an area (mentally) to allow yourself to see these things. I also lived in London and yes there was crime which I saw. The city centre is grotty and dirty, people dress trampy. If you are going to move here, the only place to do so would be the suburbs I've seen here and they are wonderful. Transport is awful, the buses stop after like 6pm and so do the shops. The night life is good for students.

AA12095483	It isn't a stupid question at all. "Old Quebec" gets tons of tourists and can handle people who don't speak French. That said, you'll have more fun if you have a basic grasp of the language. For things to see and do, google up Quebec tourism and you'll find lots of stuff. It's a fun place to be - and if you are there in the springtime you can take part in the sugaring-off (collecting maple sap from the maple trees and converting it into syrup, sugar or candy.)
ORonhAuvaa	Think about who first landed in this country. The Puritans. Does that tell you all you need to know? We are the country of the Scarlett letter. <br>  <br>  And yet Americans have tremendous energy and along with that comes pretty sexualized behavior. So we are losing our prudish attitude generation by generation. I don't think many young Americans are that prudish anymore.<br>  <br>  What is really sick is the treatment of gays and lesbians. There is a rabid, fascist group of Christians who have their panties in a wad over homosexuality for no rational reasons. In California, 73% of blacks voted for restricting marriage to a man and a woman. We helped them win their freedom and now 73% in California think it is OK to restrict the freedom of another group. Go figure. <br>  <br>  Does that make any kind of sense? Oh, you were expecting Americans to make sense?|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	hmm.... good question, yeah talk about hypocrisy.  Its almost like in America, you never make it past high school, emotionally I mean.  Peer pressure is at its apex, and everyone runs around worried about what everyone else thinks.  Right and wrong is set aside for what's "Cool".  But we're all adults see, so we need to call it something else.  So we call it "Political Correctness" because it sounds cool.......<br>  <br>  Ok.... I'm getting sarcastic, but the very trait you asked about drives me up a wall.  Honestly, people behave as though they were still in school.  Nothing makes sense, logic is shoved to the side for emotion.   <br>  <br>  I think its a result of the clash of Religious conservatism and trying to be trendy.  Nudity is a collateral casualty. I'm an American, I live in NY state.  But I'm also a nudist, so I understand very well what your saying.|`|6IooffjFaa	Why are you so obsessed with this and how many times are you going  to keep asking even though it gets deleted every time?|`|bIJAGVjZaa	you have nudist beaches?|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i completely agree with you. i do not know why it is like this here in the US. but yeah, you are absolutely correct about this.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	I am a 63 year old American male.....And I agree with you and wonder.

If one of you lives in the U.K., and the other in Canada isn't that going to make having "conjugal relationship" rather difficult?
xs2mpYjWaa	A student visa will require you to study a minimum of 20 hours per week as well as pay for the tuition. With this visa you wouldn't be able to travel and see the country, you would be set in one place. <br>  <br>  A tourist visa is the only real option, however, you can not work at all on this visa. You would need a lot of funds to be able to prove you can fund your trip and cover all costs. <br>  <br>  I would suggest saving up, come for as long as you can up to the 3 months and do Australia bit by bit. Northern Territory and Queensland first. Then New South Wales and Victoria another time.

bru2xnlRaa	Many 25 year old young women live on their own in the Sacramento area and manage to hold a job and pay rent. The cost of living is fair and jobs are available. Unfortunately, available jobs have many applicants seeking them. So you must do what you can to prove you are the right candidate. This is the truth throughout the United States right now, not just Sacto. You will be able to survive on your income and live in decent housing. It is all relative. You say you are not a big spender. This tells me you will live within your means. <br>  Come look for a job, leave the abuser. Do not take crap. Be independent and find new friends who are good influence in your life.|`|nJqMfR4baa	Hopefully Leave?<br>  <br>  Abusive Husband?<br>  <br>  Go now.

I had kids and it was many years ago. <br>  <br>  Leave him honey. I am lucky I survived.|`|i1AsTUG0aa	First of all I am sorry about your situation. I went throught the same thing when I was a child with my mother. When you do finally leave your husband you may want to consider heading to a local police station to get directions for a local women's shelter. Or even when you get to Sacramento you should head to a womens shelter. It will give you a chance to basically "fall off the face of the Earth" for a while until you can get a job, home, car, etc. and support yourself. Good luck.<br>  <br>  The Sacramento job market is pretty much saturated with people looking for jobs. If you have a strong resume then you could get hired quickly. Look into services such as Monster, CareerBuilder, the Sacramento Bee, etc.<br>  <br>  A local morning news talkshow, Good Day Sacramento (KMAX-TV), has a service called Good Day Sacramento Job Center in which they announce a loation about once or twice a month where the "Job Center" will be held. At these events you have the oppurtunity to make a professional Video Resume, professional Paper Resume, and your own online job profile all for FREE! The next Job Center will be at:<br>  <br>  The Folsom Telegraph<br>  Wednesday, March 11, 2009<br>  5-10 a.m. <br>  12755 Folsom Blvd. <br>  Folsom, CA 95630<br>  <br>  All you have to do is keep watching this news channel to find out the next location.<br>  <br>  As for housing, the Sacramento area is currently in a very bad foreclosure situation. There are at least 2 empty houses on each block at the least, so you will have no problem finding a home that would of cost $700,000 in 2006, to be about $200,000 today, and homes that were about $300,000 are selling for less than $100,000 today. As for renting, i would say rentals are priced fairly, not to cheap though. It all depends on what neighborhood you are looking at.

It's a little more respectful & considering there are no more Second World countries (Communist Block), the term is redundant.<br>  <br>  Chile is currently a Developing Nation, but recent economic/political/social programs have gradually elevated the country's status. It has the best and most developed economy in Latin America and is poised to enter the Developed World around 2020.|`|AHpzpRieaa	First, you have to ask yourself what "third world country" means. If you research it a little you'll see that it's an outdated term from the cold war (around 1950!). At that point, Chile was definitely classified as third world.<br>  <br>  Today, who knows? Maybe you should define what you think is a third world country (according to income, mortality, literacy, etc?) and then see where Chile falls in your definition.<br>  <br>  Generally, Chile is called "developing" right now, and not "third world".|`|7d4LaiWSaa	I'm from Chile and we are definitely not a 3rd world country. I've visited myself a lot of countries, including the neighborhood, USA and Europe, and we are far away from some countries (namely swiss, germany), but not so far from USA. The thing here is that the income is very unbalanced (not as in other countries, but more than USA), We don't have extreme poverty, none dies from hunger or diarrhea, but a lot of people lives with less than us$500 per month, or even as low as us$250 per month. The other issue, is that the cities are also unbalanced. Santiago, the capital has nothing to envy from some USA cities. Has a nice and clean Metro on the underground, some skyscrapers, nice 5 stars Hotels like Hyatt, Raddison, Marriot, etc... It also has the best roads and highways on the area... But on the other side, there's a lot of other cities that are way behind in progress... we have more than 50% Internet penetration on homes and or Mobile phones have 8 numbers plus ID code (about 2 years ago 7 numbers weren't enough). The education is not as good as we want to, but is definitely not from the 3rd world. We have some good Universities and Institutes. Far from the level of top universities, but enough to feed them with high quality post grade students.<br>  <br>  Comparatively with Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, and pretty much any Latin American country, Chile is a better place to live and work. Brazil is more advanced in almost all areas, but definitely is not a better place.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|TraW43j3aa	it is from a developed countries point of view (germany , usa , japan ).. but is not a  3th world  country .. industry and the technological progress of it have made it in a 2nd world country category

The I Drive one is newer, so I would expect it to be somewhat better than the Sea World one.  I Drive is the center of the attraction tourist area, close to Universal and City Walk and there are plenty of restaurants and things to do – movies, mini golf, etc. in the area. <br>  <br>  HGVC really does things right – the rooms are well decorated and have DVD players, etc.; the pools are real nice; and the food and beverage service at their restaurants and bars is of good quality and reasonably priced.  If y’all are bringing kids, there are plenty of activities to keep them busy as well.  <br>  <br>  Plus if you do but a HGVC time share you get access to their properties, plus RCI’s – you have plenty of choices for vacations around the world.<br>  <br>  Good luck and safe travels!|`|1yqucDzaaa	I would love to hear the response on this topic as well!

I live in New England but have spent a lot of time in Alabama, and lived there for five years, and have only run into a handful of people who think that way.

I live in San Francisco, and years ago when I didn't have insurance I got lots of work done at the UOP (University of the Pacific Dental school). It was great! I got excellent care b/c these are students who are basically graduating, they just need to complete some pratical work first, and everything they do is thoroughly reviewed by instructors (who are dentists) before they're finished with the procedure. I even had a bite guard made there at a waaay cheaper rate (those things are pricey at regular dentists).|`|AA11341543	Thailand is great.I am an American living here.I cracked a tooth and had to have it fixed.The dentist was trained in the U.S. and his office was high tech.It cost me about $7.50 to have it fixed.|`|KSCTuTaFaa	The cheapest place to get your dental done would be in Pakistan.

SwIOyL0laa	To begin with, it was built below sea level, requiring levees to prevent flooding.  Also, whenever they build levees on a river, it increases the flood risk downstream because it prevents the natural floodplains from performing their natural function, so all the locks and levees further up the river came to increase the flood risk in NO.  The floods became inevitable.  And what impacts do YOU think the floods had?  You've seen the pics of the damage.  Think a little.|`|EgfL2c86aa	humans didn't "make" the flooding worse. what impacts did the flood have?....did you really just ask that?

KjYxk1S2aa	I would definitely recommend going!<br>  <br>  I live in the US as well, but I've gone to London/the rest of England several times, and I love it there. In fact, I'm traveling there again this summer. London has tons of stuff to do--you will NEVER have time to do it all, and it's extremely fun. Just walking around town is great, they have wonderful museums, the public transportation is cheap, and Hyde Park is a fantastic place to spend a day or so at. :) My boyfriend is from the UK, and he loves to come to America...but I definitely prefer England. I also recommend taking trips by train out into the other towns--Hampton Court, Cambridge and York are great, too.<br>  <br>  You'll have to save up a little, but try to book your flights in advance, and you can probably get them quite cheap! Try shopping around online. You'll want to go for a couple of weeks if you do, because you'll want all the time you can get to enjoy it!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and hopefully your trip works out.<br>  <br>  ~Jen|`|9f363935da83a04ad649588218c4b33caa	I've been there a couple times (not in a long time though).

iw2cckG5aa	Alot of state schools have scholarships specifically for out of state students. Your best bet is to figure out what school you want to go to and go up onto their website. You can look at their financial aid page or you can get into contact with any of their career counselors who have information on available scholarships.
HnqedumSaa	because a majority of factory workers in china are unskilled and paid low wages so you cant possibly expcet them to make a xbox or an ipod but making a crappy little souvinor or something requires no skill to make and is easy<br>  hope u understood my logic there|`|rAKR7yCBaa	first of all, a lot of the workers in china are cheap labors. They are used to make products in the highest efficiency. Quantity is more prominent than quality. Also, when the numbers go up too high, they have less demand then. I hope you know where I am getting at.|`|3lnICFrgaa	The reason for that stereotype is because almost all "novelty" items or other low quality items come from China. <br>  <br>  They export a lot of good stuff, but they also export a lot of junk.|`|fukzl8oaaa	Becauuse these people are living in the past !!!|`|SAAO0xXgaa	When too many people say something, there is a level of truth in that.

There are a lot of free family things to do including a great zoo, Grants Farm, childrens museum (not sure how old your kids are), The Arch, Budweiser tour (my kids liked it), etc. <br>  <br>  Disney in Orlando has lots of great deals going on. I believe if you pay for 3 nights, you get 3 or 4 additional nights free. The meal plan is definitely worth it, and make reservations for the sit down meal before you go if you can figure out which parks you will be at during particular days. <br>  <br>  This year (2 more weeks!) we are going to go down to Memphis for a few days and then head down to Biloxi, MS and do some day trips to New Orleans.<br>  <br>  You fail to mention what kind of budget you are on and how old your kids are.

Try to make sure you've already secured a job before you go, there are loads of websites out there for you to look for work in the UK.  <br>  <br>  If you're the adventuring type & you're going to go any way, make sure you have your European Health Insurance sorted & speak to your local benefits office in Ireland to find out how you can sign on in the UK.  Once you're in the UK try to sign up to temp agencies, they might only get you a few days work here & there but it's better then doing nothing and you might get a foot in the door temping.  <br>  <br>  If you're a University graduate, find out if your Uni has an alumni association and if there's chapters in the UK.  If you are a Uni graduate, you also need to bear in mind when they talk about college in the UK they're not talking about University they're discussing further education institutions where they do A Levels & vocational courses.  You need to describe yourself as a University graduate or graduating from Uni rather then college, it might seem like a relatively minor detail but it can make a huge difference to how you're perceived.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gumtree.com/</a>|`|oDz0FQpEaa	I moved from ireland to england for uni.

Even some beaches in Phuket will be uncrowded that time of year and there's many beach areas and islands nearby where you should be able to find uncrowded beaches if Phi Phi is too crowded for you.

YE28jqL0aa	yes you can use a drivers liscence in poland.<br>  but not only a permit, which i think is a learners. cause in poland you cannot drive with a learners like here.<br>  this is how you use it if you have a liscence;<br>  get in a car and drive. just to let you know, all cars in poland are standards. like the stick shifts. it is very very hard to find an automatic.<br>  so if you dont know how to drive a stick shift, then dont bother. :) you wont learn in time.  it take months to fully learn and be compitent.<br>  if you ever get pulled over, just show them your liscece.<br>  there should be no problem.<br>  and driving is similar to what it is here in northamerica. (im canadian so i presume canada & us is same driving)<br>  there are some signs that are different. so look it up.<br>  oh and there are no yellow dividing lines signifiying opposite traffic flows. its all white. so dont try to change lanes. lol<br>  and people in poland are insane drivers, they drive wayyy to fast for they roads. btw the road conditions are horrible.<br>  just be safe and look up the signs, and know how to drive stick. :)<br>  <br>  whats with the thumbs down? maybe cause when i go to poland im only in small towns and small cities, im my cities the white lane thing is true, i never saw yellow divider lines.<br>  they are white. so opposite traffic was divided by a white line. if you didnt know that you might swith lanes or something and die, its rough, polish driving is insane. good luck.<br>  you best bet if youve never been is not to drive.<br>  <br>  JUST SAW YOUR POST. <br>  no, you can not legally drive around since you only have a learners. so forget everything cause you cant legally.<br>  have fun!|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	you should have no problems- but just to be sure better get an International Driver's License. It's valid for 1 year and has multiple language versions of your driving license- that way no hassle with some cop who is less than gifted with languages.<br>  Ask at your local driving license office- they should have them<br>  <br>  bear in mind that 99,99% of the cars in Poland have manual shift gear boxes. Just make sure you know how to operate one - and remember that most car makers have different gear boxes. <br>  What I usually do is sit for 5 minutes in a new car and just shift the gears "dry run". make sure you know how to shift into reverse- some are real tricky<br>  <br>  Driving rules are fairly straightforward- if in doubt the guy on the right has the right of way. <br>  One possible difference- when you come to a red light you may see a green arrow ATTACHED TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT. This DOES NOT mean you CAN drive to the right (as in "right of way") but it means you MAY turn right- IF THE WAY IS FREE (there may be pedestrians and other road users who have a green light at the same time- so if you crunch it's your fault)<br>  A green arrow ON THE LENS OF THE TRAFFIC LIGHT (NOT on the side of it) does give you the "all clear"<br>  <br>  Another thing- every body here drives like a mad taxi driver from New York- or worse. And the pedestrians are deaf, blind and brainless. <br>  Be very careful.|`|Gcwbw5q8aa	You have to be 18.<br>  You have to have a full driving license.<br>  And that also answers No. 3.|`|4VdvTkilaa	I don't think you can drive in Poland with learners permit because they don't have the learners permit there.

6b85f9916ea2b733bde0d13260bd6479aa	try airtreks.com they specalize in RTW, (round the world) fares and have some amazing deals.  They also do cicular pacific routes which would really help with your asia plans.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airtreks.com/Products_RoundTrips.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.airtreks.com/Products_RoundTr...</a><br>  <br>  LA to Bangkok<br>  round trip $419 without taxes.<br>  <br>  There are several ways to get the best airfare: <br>    Try one of the big companies: Travelocity.com., Priceline or Expedia.com. The advantage to them is that they show many different airlines and the cheapest prices for both the specific date you want to fly and the dates surrounding that date.  In case your plans are flexible. The disadvantage is that you are locked into the fare dates.  If you want to change a date due to injury or an emergency, their fees can be extreme.   <br>    My personal method it to use Kayak.com as my initial check on fares and dates.   I generally start at least a month in advance when looking for a ticket. The farther in advance, up to 3 months, the better. The nice thing about kayak is that it hooks you up directly to the airline.  Hence… you don’t get locked too deeply into one of the big three that charge up the wazoo for rescheduling.   Then I figure one or two flights that are at the right times and right prices.  In the upper left corner of the Kayak screen there is a feature that says “ track fares by email”. It’s referred to as Fare tracker and it really helps. Sign into this feature and it will update you daily on the changes in airfare.  At least once in the month you are going to be able to find a fare that is usually a couple of hundred dollars less than what you have been quoted in the first place.  A very cool feature. <br>  Also, check out currentcodes.com and naughtycodes.com. These two sites have discount codes for some of the airlines and can save you some real money if you catch a special at the right time. They have discount codes for just about everything including airfares and Cruises. Not to mention coupon type codes for many stores and services.<br>  If that is not what you want or you are in more of a hurry,  then…<br>    Try the airlines directly. Either their Web sites or direct telephone lines. Some of the Airlines offer low price guarantees meaning that if you find a cheaper fight on another Web site they may match the price or beat it. Each airline is different though, so you have to check them out individually. <br>    Just remember, if you are going to try to get the cheapest flights, the airlines normally have restrictions. You may have to purchase the ticket 14 or 21 days in advance, there may be no refunds or changes allowed.  You really need to know these restrictions.   <br>     If you try looking for a last-minute flight you will end up paying a lot more, although there are occasional exceptions.  I personally, managed a last minute ticket to S.F on the Millennium New Years eve. And received a better price than my friends that had booked a month in advance!    But… you cannot depend on this at all. <br>     Usually travel agents do not get the lowest fares and sometimes they tack on a commission. Travel agencies used to be the best way to get the best airfare, but with the Internet, It is now just as easy for individuals to check themselves.<br>     If you call an airline directly (they all have toll-free numbers), be sure to ask them if they have any specials. Often they do have specials, but you have to ask them about them, they won’t just tell you!  <br>  So be careful about restrictions on tickets.  Be aware of charges for overweight baggage and remember that many of the very CHEAP fares you see in the Travel section of the local Papers are fares that are quoted, “without taxes”  Taxes can really add up.  <br>  Have fun and happy travels.

OBGYN and Gyn is just for when there are major problems - throughout a pregnancy most women only see their GP - OB is only for high risk and Gyno for when there is a major problem (not for pap smear etc). So there isnt as much a demand for these specialties.
aiKLvwGTaa	England is a country, not a state. I think some people seem to forget that...<br>  <br>  Our postcodes refer to a specific building or a few buildings.

VxfyQZ2jaa	First, please realize that more than just New Orleans was devastated by Katrina, which was the worst natural disaster to ever strike the USA. The storm killed more than 1800 people in LA & MS, displaced more than 2,000,000 for months, made 500,000 of us long-term homeless, wrecked an area of 90,000 square miles (larger than Great Britain), destroyed 225,000 buildings, and the damage to the City of New Orleans alone was $200 Billion. New Orleans was only a fraction of the devastated area.<br>  <br>  There are no parts of the metro area that are "still just like the storm left them" as there has been huge progress in the past 3 1/2 years. Most of the metro area and much of the City of New Orleans now looks like Katrina never happened. Government services are working normally, the utilities are on, you can drink the water, restaurants & stores are open, and the City has hosted numerous major tourism events since Katrina w/o problems. <br>  <br>  The work was mostly done using savings and insurance, NOT government aid.  If the federal government really did appropriate Billions for the reconstructions then the Blanco (Democrat Governor of LA) administration stole or misappropriated much of it.  Search "Louisiana Road Home Program" for articles. <br>  <br>  The worst-flooded parts of the area are still struggling to recover, and that includes neighborhoods like Lakeview, Gentilly, & the Lower 9th Ward, plus most of Saint Bernard Parish and the southern half of Plaquemines Parish (Parish = County).  The pre-Katrina population will never return to many neighborhoods as they have made new lives wherever they went during the evacuation. It is not known if others will move to New Orleans to replace the ones who left.<br>  <br>  Southern Mississippi is also making progress, but parts of the coast still look like Hiroshima after the atomic bomb.  <br>  <br>  Our greatest need now (in the form of outside assistance) is to have proper flood protection constructed. The reason the City flooded so badly was because the federal government built a poorly designed, improperly constructed, and inadequately funded levee system. The federal government is supposed to be rebuilding the system to a much higher standard, but it is clear the bureaucrats & politicians want to divert the funds to other projects.<br>  <br>  We shall see......|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Under the great leadership of Mayor Nagen the touristy areas like the French Quarter have been completely restored, and the lower class, low income residential areas have been totally ignored.|`|7916c4d17333b435a55f05340490ade1aa	some parts of the city are still like the storm left them, in disarray . there are still families without homes, people with out jobs. but they are making a come back. i feel they will be better and stronger as time goes by and things start getting built,repaired or replaced. they are a strong willed town.|`|zgDQrI2uaa	"What has/hasn't happened to help the victims of Katrina?"  <br>  <br>  What hasn't happened is a decent levee system.  Back in 1965, after Hurricane Betsy a new plan to revamp the levees was put into place, but nothing really happened.  The US congress took money away from levee projects and put it into bike paths for brother-in-laws etc.  The funding and projects were never complete.<br>  <br>  Forty years later Katrina exposes the federal waste, cost cuts and delays on levee fortification.  So what happens?  Promises are made, grandstand speeches are given, and plans to revamp the levees are made.  So far the levees are not finished, the dates keep getting pushed back, congress is again cutting the budget and handing the money over to bankers and auto industry CEOs, and levees are again being constructed with crap materials, (sand instead of clay, and newspaper instead of rubber).  <br>  <br>  Wanna know more?  levees.org|`|L6ILAJ3Baa	Most of the city has been rebuilt thankfully, but there are still some parts of the city that has been left alone.<br>  The victims have all been treated by FEMA(in not so great trailers though).

AA10254694	Staying in the Business District or the French Quarter or the Garden District will be fine.  I worked there in 2006 and had no problems.  <br>  <br>  Its some of the outlying areas to the west and south of the central city that had trouble when the levees broke, The 9th ward,17th Street Canal, London Avenue Canal  were surrounded by low lying areas that were devastated and many areas still haven't recovered.|`|VxfyQZ2jaa	Yes, it is safe to visit New Orleans.  It is also safe to live here.  It is not scary unless you take a "ghost", "haunted", or "vampire" tour (probably not even then).<br>  <br>  There has been huge progress in the past 3 1/2 years so most of the metro area and much of the City now looks like Katrina never happened.  The City is operating normally (ex. you can drink the water) and the tourism industry has fully recovered (everything is open).<br>  <br>  New Orleans made the news since Katrina because drug dealers returning to the city have been fighting over turf and the competition is literally deadly. The reduced population made the "rate" (rate = population divided by crimes) go through the roof. Also, the Census Bureau recently announced their 2006 post-Katrina population estimate was grossly too low, which further increased the "rate". However, almost 98% of serious violent crime in New Orleans happens within the illegal drug community (mainly crack cocaine) and the other 2% are "domestic" homicides. That does NOT make the crimes OK, but the average resident or visitor doesn't have to worry about it. Other crime in New Orleans is at or below the national average, and all one needs to be safe is to use the same basic common sense required in every city in the world.<br>  <br>  Answers on YA often mention badly-flooded areas like the Lower 9th Ward and say they are unsafe. The L9W is struggling to recover from Katrina (it may never do so) and almost no one lives there now. It looks bad because of all the empy lots & unrepaired houses, but no one was ever robbed by an abandoned house. It is also a neighborhood you would have no reason to visit unless you take one f the "Katrina" bus tours so you can see a still-struggling area.|`|ozBkHxuHaa	Honestly, New Orleans is such a wonderful place. It's one of my favorite places in the whole world, and definately my favorite place in USA. The music, art, food and people, especially the people, are so fantastic and different that it's hard not to smile the entire time while you're there. <br>  I think that tourism is one of the best things for New Orleans, since money is needed to restore it after Katrina.<br>  <br>  Go! It's perfectly safe, and a truly beautiful place!

gm9QYLjIaa	I love this question. Basically both are absolutely great for different reasons. <br>  <br>  To live I'd say the Asian side. It's an (almost) untouched with an abundance of green in the middle of the big city, far from the crowds (not too far though) where you can always find somewhere to escape from the rush of the city. And honestly I know this may sound weird but the people are warmer on this side, I guess away form the crowds and urban lifestyle people stay a lot nicer. Time moves slower too. This side is also ideal for a paced Sunday. But as far as I know this side is also a bit more crowded, on the more inner parts of the city you may find immigrant settlements that come from the South-East with a more "traditional" state of mind. That's why you'd notice a lot of burqa wearing women and bearded men in buses, who are almost non-existing on the other side (Aside form Fatih and stuff). But that's really not that much of a bother it's just an observation. Most of the Sultans' and Pashas' summer houses are on this side as well, and all of them are renovated and pretty well kept. It's also easier to find houses with a Bosphorus view half the price. <br>  <br>  But the action is on the other side, on the European side. If I were to live in Istanbul I'd definitely choose this side. It's more young, more buzzling with excitment, you can never stop, your attention continues to wander off out of your control, there's a lot to do, a lot to see. Think of large New York. This side is definitely another world. But it is also pricier, a lot crowded during tourist season, noisy and dirty. But I think if you're willing to overlook serenity (Although there's the Yildiz forest in Besiktas where you could go to get a little bit of nature), this side is for everyone. You've got every kind of nightlife you're looking for. Different kind of people. A lot more history. And hey you can always cross to the other side with a simple vapur (ferryboat). Which is one of the most magnificent things in life in mind opinion: getting on a ferryboat with a glass of Turkish tea, looking out onto the Bosphorus while fully knowing that you're crossing two continents. The ferryboats are also very regular, so transportation is really not a difficulty even if you don't have a car.<br>  <br>  Cetin: Honestly, anywhere from Uskudar to Anadolu Kavagi in the Asian side is just magnificent. Ah what I wouldn't give to have a Kanlica yogurt right now.|`|AA11854330	If you like night life, entertainment and lux places; European.<br>  But if you like natural, peaceful (there is enternatinment here too but less than European) and nice places; then Asian.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	Both sides are nice but you can't say that you have seen Istanbul without seeing the European side.|`|ICvNW8OSaa	Asian side for sure. The mosque's and the Ezan make Istanbul....Istanbul!!!!!|`|xOJL5fPgaa	European side has historical places, suburbs, business centers etc. In fact, Istanbul originated from European side (seven hills city), which is today's Emin?nü, Sultanahmet, Galata; Karak?y...<br>  Asian side was more like vacation place for the rich people then.

The traffic may sometimes be chaotic.
wFBVuBOkaa	If I had to compare the Brown Palace versus the Oxford, both of which are very "grande-dame" old luxury hotels...<br>  <br>  I think you get more for your money at the Oxford, honestly, though the Brown Palace offers more perks and a more expansive staff. The Brown Palace's valet service is, I think, free for guests while the Oxford charges. The staff at the Brown Palace is amazing. However, the Oxford's regular rooms are nicer than the Brown Palace's regular rooms in every way I can think of, and the Oxford is much cheaper - sometimes you can get rooms at $99/night. The staff is very nice there as well. The Oxford offers a 24-7 room service from McCormicks, an excellent seafood/Irish restaurant located just downstairs. The food is cheaper in each hotel's respective restaurant.<br>  <br>  I haven't experienced the spa attached to the Oxford, but the Brown Palace spa is incredible and one of the best spa values in the entire state. But you could always stay at the Oxford and do spa at the Palace if that's what you're after - the Oxford's car service will take you there!|`|AA10216571	The Brown Palace is the oldest and fanciest.

tY8mx6UTaa	I also agree that you should be fine. Just don't do anything you wouldn't do at home. But I wouldn't be over paranoid, either. Just be smart and mature.<br>  <br>  Now about where you're planning to stay: don't choose a place too close to Port Authority.<br>  Areas you might want to consider are the Upper West Side and the West Village [NYU is there so there's a bunch of kids, might want to check out the Washington Square Hotel, for example]. If you want to stay in the Theater District, try to stay either on Broadway, 6th or 7th Avenues, anywhere between 41st and 53rd streets.<br>  <br>  About your time here. <br>  Be smart about time management. Three days might be too little time if you spend all the time waiting on lines to go up the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.<br>  <br>  Check out: <br>  East Village & West Village (Washington Square Park, E8th street, Indian Row)<br>  Central Park (most anywhere)<br>  Chinatown (hmm, cheap dumplings!!)<br>  Financial District (I can't recommend it enough: Trinity Church and Cemetery (Alexander Hamilton's grave is there), NYSE, Museum of American Finance)<br>  If you have the time to go to a museum, I would go to either the Museum of Natural History or the MET (at the MET you even go in with $1 "donation," and I've done it for less).<br>  Going to the Statue of Liberty(and Ellis Island) could be fun but not sure if you have the time to wait on the long lines.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm sure you can get yourself a guidebook and figure out where you want to go. <br>  <br>  Have fun and be safe.|`|WxKNmxdaaa	It will be tempting to stay out late. Trust me. The city does not sleep. Do not go on the subway after 11:00 p.m. and walk back to your hotel alone. Get a cab if you do and make sure the driver drops you right off in front of the hotel. I once (at age 20) stayed out too late (until 3 a.m.) and decided it wouldn't be a big deal to take the subway and walk home from there. It was very close to Columbia. In fact I thought it was safe because Columbia had security officers in front of the gates of the school where I'd be walking by. There were only 2 small streets where I'd be walking alone. That was where my trouble lied. As soon as I walked through those streets I was approached by 8 drunken men by myself. They were verbally harrassing me until luckily someone else walked by to my rescue. Be careful, and get a cab late at night! People who are out late, are usually not up to much good. That is my opinion. Have fun and be safe!

rljol7sjaa	Hondu has the right answer, but I will add, the only time you may not have to pay a departure tax is when you are on a connecting flight (with tickets that show it - one time departure tax)  where you land in one country or city, jump on the next flight to get to where you are going.|`|03sLrNPCaa	If you leave twice you will pay tax twice.  Nicaragua has an airport departure tax as well.  If you are traveling overland, the tax is much less than airport departure tax, but you will still have to pay a tax when you leave any of the Central American countries.  In fact, here in Honduras, we pay an airport departure tax even when we fly to a destination within the country.
AA12337848	It depends on what you want.  Roatan is a very nice place.  Very cool for water based activities.  I would go to a resort for the day so my wife can lay out at the beach while I scuba dive.  Belize is a bit strange. The port is pretty much near a slum. Once you get off the ship, you will be in an enclosed tourist village.  I would take a tour of some ruins and buy my stuff while on the tour or at the tourism village if I don't find anything on the tour.  Cozumel is pretty much 100% tourist.

But the older part of San Antonio are very pleasant after dark even in the 90s.<br>  <br>  Houston is a very humid place and it is plagued with pollution and bugs(mosquitos).<br>  <br>  Most all of the southern part of Texas including Southeast gets hot starting in May and there really isn't a break until October.<br>  <br>  If you are from El Paso, New Mexico or Arizona, you might find it humid.  If you are from Houston, Beaumont, Pt. Arthur, Louisiana, the gulf coast area of any of the southern states, you will find it isn't humid at all.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, San Antonio is a humid city.  Runs from 57% humidity to 83% humidity.<br>  <br>  For more information:<br>  <a href="http://www.cityrating.com/cityhumidity.asp?City=San+Antonio" rel="nofollow">http://www.cityrating.com/cityhumidity.a...</a>|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	Compared to Houston, San Antonio is bone dry.<br>  <br>  The only time I remember it being humid in San Antonio was after an infrequent afternoon thunderstorm. The t-storm would last fifteen minutes, and then the sun would come back out and the humidity would be close to 100%. Made for a miserable evening, but it was gone the next day.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	Yes, San Antonio is humid.  All this part of the state is.  San Antonio's average relative humidity in the morning is 83%, in the afternoon 57%.  I'd call that humid!|`|bwygouP8aa	Humid is what you are used to, SA will start getting in the 90s in May and stay there until October or so.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	No, San Antonio is inland enough. Actually, it's kind of arid.|`|99e8a82414fa74d54a5b31d3a0175630aa	Humidity any where from mid march to Oct..Summers are brutal..and Yes, San Antonio, is very humid.|`|AA11114814	Usually it is but as of late it's almost desert like.
nF9DZ0sOaa	They grow here, sure, but are not native to the area.|`|AA12343309	Most of us in the southern states, except Florida, want shade trees, not palm trees.<br>  <br>  The shade knocking off the direct sunlight particularly from windows saves money on energy and keeps us cooler in summer. Down here we find it more economical<br>  to turn on a lamp rather than let the direct sunlight come in through a glass window.<br>  <br>  Those 75 and 100 watt bulbs burn a mere pittance to a compressor on an air conditioner.<br>  <br>  Edit: I might add that San Antonio is very much inland. I live about 25 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.   In the coastal region it is hot and humid.  Texas is not a peninsula like Florida where they get a cross breeze that moderates the climate.<br>  A lot of Northern owned franchises come down here and frequently put palm trees around their business.  One year in January, I heard a man compliment to restaurant owner on his palm trees and said more business here should have them.  I told him, "No way. Wait till summer comes and he would understand."  He admitted after spending summer here that people want shade tree not palm trees.|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	Yes, but they are NOT native to the region. If you see one it is because a builder brought some into an upscale subdivision or shopping center.|`|BUkQybJLaa	if you plant them there can be but that dont grow naturally here|`|S2dzWHTKaa	Check on Google Earth|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Yes
KS2OHXCRaa	Thomas as a surname is relatively common but not so much with George. <br>  <br>  Here's a link that explains re French surnames, the meanings, and the list of top 25 most common ones including Martin, Bernard, Petit, Dubois etc. <a href="http://genealogy.about.com/cs/surname/a/french_surnames.htm" rel="nofollow">http://genealogy.about.com/cs/surname/a/...</a>|`|wg0hmrvWaa	Those are first names, not last names. But it can also be last names of course. at a first name George is "Georges" with an "s" in France, and is less common than Thomas.<br>  <br>  you can see here how many times was "Thomas" give as a first name per year of birth : big hiy in the 90's...<br>  <a href="http://www.prenom.com/prenom/Thomas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prenom.com/prenom/Thomas.html</a><br>  <br>  while "Georges" is decreasing <br>  <a href="http://www.prenom.com/v2/services-prenom/prenom.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.prenom.com/v2/services-prenom...</a><br>  <br>  I know one Georges and plenty of Thomases !
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Branded clothing is always fairly expensive - but about the same as you say.<br>  <br>  There are also non-branded (same quality - really) which are cheaper, and there are stores that are way more expensive.<br>  <br>  Best thing - shop around till you find what you like.|`|wnrRXbFCaa	I found really reasonable prices at New Yorker just off Dam square. Also at any H&M..|`|1wHvGHdFaa	I was just at Vero Moda yesterday and the prices seem to be pretty comparable to what you're describing.  Of course, generally speaking, I think everything here is overpriced but I'm from the U.S. so that explains it!
ng0orRrbaa	I don't know.  I tend to disagree with the previous answers as an American.  I have traveled to many countries and found Panama to be rather boring when it came to partys.  Yes, they party a lot but with other Panamanians. I lived there 8 months and never found anyplace I really cared for. If you really want to party go to Mexico.  Don't take this wrong.  They are nice people but take warming up to you.  In Mexico I make a new set of friends every time I go out and have the most fun!|`|YECoNXiIaa	Oh yeah !!! I′m from Colombia (next to Panama) and I have lots of friends who have been there!! They′ve said parties are really good in there shopping is also good in there ... there is an island close to Panama it′s called San Andres I′ve been there .. Oh man party 24 hours u can drink anywhere and wherever u are there are people selling cocktails (very good cocktails) and that island is tax free as well as Panama so booze is quite cheap ... I hope u will have a great time in either place ..|`|U1SdGbGaaa	Panama is famous for being a party city.  People there Dont respect rules and they love to Drink.  THere is no time limits for this kind of things, so you can pretty much drink until the sun comes out.  There are Girls, and many of them are atracted to American Dudes.  (Except  me of course)
fv2GAAdPaa	Yes you will get lots of partying in St.Lucia so enjoy!<br>  <br>  =]|`|S0uCKptBaa	There's a lot of partying in St. Lucia. If you are staying at the rex resort in rodney bay then you are right in the middle of the nightlife. There are a bunch of restaurants and clubs with in walking distance. Also taxis and buses are available to take you to parties in other areas. On fridays they have the jump off/fish fry in gros islet. Everyone goes so its not hard to get to. Also the locals are very friendly so just ask what the spot is for the night.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Asking if there is partying in the Caribbean is like asking if there is anything to eat at the Golden Corral.
xs2mpYjWaa	Firstly, you have a return ticket, that lessens the funds needed. Generally if you don't have a ticket you need funds to purchase one which can be $2,000. <br>  <br>  If you have work lined up that would prove income which IF they look will be on your side. <br>  <br>  I would bring a certified copy of your bank statement (just have the bank stamp it) as well as a letter from your father saying that he will support you while in Australia and send you additional funds if and when you need them, a copy of his bank statement wouldn't hurt either. Often you see on these border security shows they will ring the person supporting them, so to have a letter with further contact details should be a help.<br>  <br>  Most people won't be picked out, sometimes they might seem to pick a particular race or age, whatever... but it is random and you could appear as the risky tourist on your plane, you don't know. But I wouldn't think the probability is a high one but I wouldn't be taking too many chances either. Try and save what you can, have bank statements and a letter saying your father will support you, if you can get a credit card that can help but as with credit cards you would be needing to make payments while in Australia, so they don't guarantee anything. <br>  <br>  Just a thought, can you not get a sponsored visa for the job through the Au Pair company. Just a temporary visa, not PR. I would be contacting them and asking and expressing your concerns. I'm sure they have been there before.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	The problem is that if they do check and if you can't satisfy them that what you do have is enough, they'll refuse entry and put you on the next plane home. You'll probably be OK, but if you catch an immigration officer on a bad day, who knows what will happen? <br>  <br>  How long are you coming for? How long is the au pair job for? Be aware that the au pair job can't be for any longer than 6 months, and if you intend staying longer than that, you will be expected to have funds for at least part of any remaining time in Australia.
9MVzoSCHaa	I used to live in Canarsie and there was always parking available. This was the area located in the E. 100's btwn Flatlands and Seaview Avenue.<br>  <br>  I live in Bay Ridge now and never have to look for more than 5 minutes --95% of the time.|`|Z9R2VEn2aa	i used to live in brooklyn but then moved cause of the parking spaces. If u want to live in brooklyn u have to learn to use the subway, train/bus.|`|h8OqX12Haa	its better to use the subways or buses( although buses are usually overflown with people especially in the morning) i live in QUeens but im in Brooklyn everyday ( sunset park)|`|xRUZkFU9aa	Yes there are..but like everywhere in NYC...you usually have to drive around for 15-20 minutes until you get lucky...it sucks..and that's why I can't wait to move back to California! :)
ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Good for what?<br>  <br>  It's in East LA, which isn't exactly Beverly Hills. However, you CAN learn there. Jaime Escalante taught there (see the movie "Stand and Deliver"). Their big rival is Roosevelt.|`|PF20BH6Waa	only if u want ur kid to get pregnant or shot|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	It's more of an average school. It's not good but at the same it's not bad.

168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	There are nude beaches.  There are family beaches and one that are not.  For the ones that are not family beaches, you will find kids and their parents, even males wearing thongs (which is illegal at a "Family" beach and can get that person arrested, apparently. so Topless women are probably worse in the eyes of the law than a thong bottom.) So, definitely stay clear of "Family Beaches".  Treasure Island is NOT a family Beach. Clearwater Beach is.<br>  <br>  Caladesi Island is great secluded beach. As for Nude beaches...Madeira in St. Pete had one years ago...but I don't know any off the top of my head.

AA11496012	Orbitz.com says that if you buy your ticket and someone buys their ticket for the same flight at a lower price, they will refund you the difference.  Delta Airlines claims that if you buy your ticket on their website, it will be cheaper than if you buy it on a travel website otherwise your flight is free.|`|UsqG6X6Baa	Depends really on where you are going.Try cheap-o-air or priceline for travel.I've had great results with both sites.|`|ub49CIN6aa	I would say www.Priceline.com *name your own price* but they have very unfriendly fine print "The airline may decide your travel time. It can be anywhere from 6:00 a.m to 11:59 p.m." Meaning you may not get to your destination at a reasonable time. No site can offer lower airfare, they just tell you the cheapest airlines.<br>  Easiest way is to look for international flights. They fly all across the US, what is a layover for one person is a nonstop flight for you.<br>  Try British or Jamaica Air.|`|KzUb9b5Haa	Depending on where and when you are flying....<br>  You may check out Allegiant or Southwest Airlines.<br>  Otherwise-<br>  -Expedia<br>  -Kayak<br>  -Orbitz<br>  -Travelocity|`|fzjePK5Haa	Here's a site I found helpful when booking my last trip.
