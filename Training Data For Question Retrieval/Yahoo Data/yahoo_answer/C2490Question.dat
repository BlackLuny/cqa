Also, I am in a quandary as to whether i should purchase the Holga w/ Hotshoe. Does the regular Holga camera come with the option to change the flash with color cubes or gels of some sort? Because the only use I would really have for a Hotshoe would be in using the colorsplash flash... or should I stick to the classic, Holga?      Oh, and is 120mm or 35mm film better? I was thinking of also getting the 35mm film converter, as I really like 35mm Lomography color film.         Thanks for any, and I mean any help you can offer.

We can't decide if we should play:   1.Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana or   2. An original song. Kind of a funk rock piece.    Both of these songs would be instrumental, because our singer quit on us.   I'm the drummer, but I am going to have to go up front and introduce the rest of the band. But what I am really worried about is this.There is a slight possibility that we could be on stage looking like a bunch of NERDS.   What the hell should we wear?    Our lead guitarist is originally from Bangledesh. He has dark skin, black hair, and is tall and skinny.   Our rhythm guitarist is white, brown hair, average height and skinny as a twig.   Our bassist is the tallest member of the band. he is Puerto-Rican with dark wavy hair (which the girls love, bastard always gets them) dude is mad skinny but he always wears large shirts and stuff like that.   Finally, I am average height, brown hair and in good shape.   Any ideas that you might have on what we should wear, what song we should play, or even where we should all stand, this would be greatly appreciated. Thanx guys.   Note: our band is called Bleach

20090309173019AAnIjZY	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Can you help me with the "Baker" surname in Eastern Europe?	Hi.      My great grandmother, Rosemilla, had the maiden name Baker. All I know are the years she died and that she was from Austria-Hungary's Galicia (in a town in between Poland and Ukraine).      Her father was Leonid Baker.      I don't know much because she died young and my grandfather was taken to New York and lived in an orphanage for many years.      Basically, I'm curious because "Baker" is not an Eastern European name.      My friend got a few hits on ancestry.com of people named "Baker" moving to USA from Russia and surrounding areas.      So where did the Baker name come from over in Eastern Europe?

I have new electronic tuner, and it said on the back of the case it could tune electronic and non-electronic instruments. When I use it to tune my electric guitar it worked fine, but when I used it to tune my acustic guitar it made the guitar sound terrible! My guitar teacher even told set it to the right key. So why I am I having a problem with it, should I find a different way to tune my acustic guitar? If so, are there any. I can't tune by ear.

20081025144308AAXxt2o	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please critique my writing...?	"Blake!" Her voice trembled and yet seemed to outbreak every voice in the   airport. He turned to the sound of her devastated voice, something he   never caused, but always heared in times of desperation.   Ava's body slammed against his as she grip against his arms, feeling the loss   of her bone mass in her knees. A tear rolled down her cheek, leaving a    path of anger within herself, desperation, and the sadness that rumbled   thunderously in her fragile body.      His jaw clenched and his eyes didn't unlock from her face. He swept off a tear   as she pressed her sobbing eyes into his neck.      "You can't go-- the world will stop moving." Ava's hands slid up unsteadily   to his neck and he placed his always warm hands in between her shoulder blades.      "I'm pretty sure this world is fine without me-- your better off without me.   I'm better off doing good elsewhere, to clear my head. I've fighten   all the feelings I could for you; I've accepted them and expressed them   as strongly as I could, but my heart's always been at ache, knowing your   in love with the impossible means that I can never be the one." Ava curled   in her lips and stroked his buzz-cut hair that always seemed to suit him.      "This will hurt you more... leaving," Ava cried.      "Of course it will kill me, but I'll learn from it. I'll grow detatched    from the pain, able to subside it to a condition where its only a little   unharming burn in my heart," his arms were unbreakable as he pressed her cold,   unwell body against his warm one.      "You...your...leaving me...because...." Ava stopped and shook her head,   realizing what she had been all along, "because...I'm a heart-braking    monsterous devil who's shallow and wouldn't even notice the horrible   feelings someone is dwelling on deep inside if I was standing next to them."   Ava broke into sobs again and Blake stroked her long, wavy hair.      "I've loved you all along, heart-braking monster or not, your the unbelievable   Ava that I, a hopelessly love-lost moron, fell in complete love with. And that's not a mistake,   its an unpredictable annoyance that I can't deny."      Ava almost wanted to drop on her stomach and whine and cry until she had   no more tears, and then the little strength she contained was left to say   what she wanted, but she choked on the words continously.      "You wanted to leave me without saying goodbye?" Ava's mumbling words   slurred with the choppy gaps of air and the rolling black tears along her   bright pink cheeks. The throbbing pain in her chest only became more severe   with each word of unfound hope.      "I can't ever say goodbye to you." He released his stare and shifted his   green-blue eyes toward the ignorant people of the airport. A loud speaker   crackled and Ava looked hopelessly at his expression. Not knowing what he   was hiding, but he was pretty dang good at it. Anguish, pain, fear, or   unsteadiness? Nothing. Blank eyes that hid the open plains of his truthful soul.      Ava gulped the question that trudged in her mind. "Out of all things, you   decide the best way to teach me a lesson is to leave and go to war? To    a whole other continent, what seems like all seven oceans and two galaxies away?"      "I could never prolong in another galaxy fighting for my home and its people without you    at least a phone call away. Imagine the phone bill." His laugh was a sweet unforgetable drowning symphany; he was obviously    trying to lighten the moment.      Ava gave a helpless smile and he lifted her tear-soaked chin as she spoke   in a trembling, quiet voice, "Yeah, but do you know the anguish, fear, and disaterous   stupidity for my efficentness on this staying lecture your making me dread now?"      He ran his finger smoothly along the lines of her jaw, catching several draining tears,   and ignoring bypassing strangers, "Like what I've been feeling for the past serveral years    of my life? If so, yes."      Ava shook her head in disappiontment of herself, "I really can't make you stay."      "My mind's as closed as yours in this decision and how to handle it."      Ava grabbed his jaw and kissed him lightly on the lips and as she pulled back   she saw some muse in his eyes-- something that told her this is all he wanted   for sometime, and to go to this extense to get a simple, gentle kiss? Complete   foolishness. Blake kept one of his hands pressed between her tiny shoulder blades   as he pulled out a slip of lined paper that looked old and torn. He unattatched   one of her hands around his neck and placed the paper in the only place she was ticklish, the middle of her palm, and he would know.      She unclasped the golden locket settled along her collarbone with her name beautifully engraved on it, something   she had received and always adored. She placed it in his unattatched hand, watching   the gold strands of the necklace pour in between his fingers like her melted heart.      A smile grazed upon his face that wasn't a pleasant one, more like a disagreeable one   with the words scribbled all over

But one hundred years from now   The world may be a little better   Because I was important   In the life of a child.      Poem 2:   Perseverance      A clump of dirt –   a scrub of brush   The hard-packed earth baked by the desert sun:   wearily cracked    like it’s too much effort to remain unbroken.      Nothing exists in this tired valley:   it has simply given up on life.      Only a dead cactus   brittle: a blackened skeleton   And the scattered bones of wild cattle   a remainder of what used to be.      But under the bare, brown shrub   emerging from the broken ground,   a new life pushes through.      Poem 3:   Grandma    Grandmas are for stories   about things of long ago.   Grandmas are for caring   about all this things you know.   Grandmas are for rocking you   and singing you to sleep.   Grandmas are for giving you   nice memories to keep.   Grandmas are for knowing    all the things you're dreaming of...   But, the most important thing of all,   Grandmas are for love.

20090309225128AAWQM6D	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a story that i am writing?	This story (which i wrote in a script format, at least for now) is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. There were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was Muramasa and the others name was Masamune. Muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a certain bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. It became somewhat of a rule, that once a muramasa blade is drawn, it cannot be put back into the scabbard unless and until it draws blood, even if it has to be its owners own. Its because of this reason it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. Masamune on the other hand was calm. Tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. His swords were said to rival that of the Muramasa. The legend ended around the late 1500s. I place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by Muramasa. He has killed hundreds. An imperialist samurai named Hayate barely survived. He learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known Masamune blade was kept (since it is said in the legend that the two blades would rival). This is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: For those who don't know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      Priest: There is no reason i should give you this blade      Hayate: If i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      Priest: ...Muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. A battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      Hayate: Stop. I have not come here to listen to your poetry. Each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of Muramasa. I would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, I would simply be cut down. I need it. To protect      Priest: Swords are not made to protect. They are meant to take lives.      Hayate: I am here for the masamune. Weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. But i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. It will be used to take a life. But the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. So i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      Priest: And if i choose to decline?      Hayate: You wont. You have burdened yourself with a duty. Now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      Priest: ...The masamune itself isn't strong enough to take on the muramasa.      Hayate: Then give me more.      Priest: I will make you a daisho, along with the blade of Masamune. Even then however, it still will not mean anything. It will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      Hayate: Then what must i do?      Priest: You must clear your mind. You must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. This sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. If you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. You must be in control..      Hayate: I have let go of the darkness years ago.      Priest: And yet you still have a long way to travel.      Hayate: Then i will travel with the masamune.      Priest: i will see to it...that you do.      Hayate: We dont have time.      Priest: And yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.   --   excerpt 2: It is soon revealed that the person who had Muramasas blade was in fact, a student of a still living Muramasa. The priest was revealed to be Masamune, who saved Hayate from certain death- in the process of sacrificing his own to the hands of Muramasa. Here, Hayate confronts Muramasa:      Muramasa: I have ridiculed you before, but i am not sorry, as i have meant the words i spoke.      Hayate: As have I.      Muramasa: You must understand, in the time that i was...alive...blood shed was the only way of life. It was do or die. It was all i was given, and all was all i was allowed to see. It is all i know.      Hayate: It is all you choose to know. And you let that same Bloodlust keep you alive to this day.      Muramasa: I have yet to find someone worthy enough to kill me.      Hayate: Masamune spoke those same words, as it makes me think that maybe not all of us are very different. In fact, in the frightening reality, many of us are the same.      Muramasa: Stop. This is how it will happen. You will attack. I will defend. You will die.      Hayate: No. it is not. As i speak these words, you are no longer in control or who lives and who dies. And after which these words are spoken, you will no longer decide other peoples fate. You will no longer decide other peoples death. I will decide yours.
20090309225036AAgMIGj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story I'm writing?	The clipping is of a romance part of the story. Its taken somewhat out of context, so I'm looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. The "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name or develop. Any constructive crit is appreciated. Also, the word family here means a strong group of friends.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "I missed you- alot. For some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. Heh. I often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   I found myself looking down. I was embarrassed by what I said. I sounded like such a loser and so desperate. I was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "I did think of you. I thought I was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...Ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   I went blank. All i could do now was stare through her in amazement. I found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "Thank you", she said.   "For what?"   "For missing me."   I let out a breath of a laugh."Why wouldn't i miss you?"   "Why would you?"   "I love you", As i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   I knew I had to say something. I couldn't help what I just said. I had to change this moment. I had to make something out of this. I had to recover from this mistake.   "I hope that didn't come out too cheesy. I spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "Hey..stop talking". She cut me off. I was ready for a verbal lashing. I felt terrible and sick. After all she went through, I should be aware of her feelings. It was so obvious. What was I thinking. Was i thinking? These Thoughts raced through my head so fast that I COULDN'T think. I attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "I love you too."   I felt like i went dead.

It seems Jesus, the one we know as the Son of God, his name actually never was Jesus. It was pronounced YESHUA in Aramaic, the actual language that Jesus spoke. Now Yeshua, in ancient Hebrew translated into English comes out to be JOSHUA, not Jesus. So is it wrong to call the Son of Man Joshua? And why, if that is the correct translation, have people called him Jesus for so long? Now before I am bombarded with frantic messages about hell and damnation from the "religious" sect and ridicule from the haters and non-believers, allow me my right to seek the truth. I am looking for the Word of God that has been translated from the literal Hebrew text and not the middle ages KJV that is so beloved today and in my opinion grossly misinterpreted.

Okay, I know making an exact replica is nigh impossible for some one like me (us poor people). But I was thinking.. If you can get two sheets of latex, add black paint in between, glue them together, and seal it in into different segments, you might have a it something similar to in the comic/movie. No? Has anyone tried something like that?
20090309210806AA3TCZK	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	So I really want to be Drum Major...?	Please read through the whole thing!   Alright, so right now I'm a sophomore, and arguably the best trumpet player in my band, except for a junior, who is also going to run for drum major.  Here's the thing; he says that marching trumpet has been ruined for him, and he did winterguard.  Now when he tries out, he's going to say if he doesn't make it, he'll go to guard.  Now the director doesn't have much of a choice to make him drum major or not.      The guy doesn't care about leadership, he's just a dictator.  I, on the other hand, have the respect and maturity to lead and nurture a band.  But now I'm worried.  I think the director will chooses him over me solely because he wants a good trumpet left.  I want to show I can be a leader because I am going to apply to the air force academy, and they prize leadership highly.  It's more than that, though.  I know I am the right man for the job.  I can do everything and anything, but I don't know if the director will see that in my quest to become drum major.      Any thoughts?   Thanks for your patience!

"Just change one of the them to nylon strings!"      Now, I know that regular steel string guitars and nylon string guitars are different things, and the sound boxes are also built differently. So, I was wondering, should I just switch the strings, or should I convince my dad to buy an actual classical?

He crawled in.    i burst into silent giggles, he looked such a mess. his hair was sticking up all over the place and he was wearing his old faded shorts that i had bought him last year for christmas. 'Hey', he said looking around. He squeezed my hand. 'Jeez your cold'.   He came over and sat beside me and lifted me into his lap. I snuggled into him breathing in his deep boy smell. He kissed the top of my head. 'God  I'm glad you gave me an excuse to get out of the boys tent,' He paused. 'Dave and Paul snore so loudly you'd think an earthquake was coming.' I buried my face in his arms to stop myself giggling.   I yawned, without meaning  to. 'Come on lets sleep'. I didnt want to, but i didnt protest. He got into my large sleeping bag and patted the spot beside him. 'Come' he whispered. i crawled over to him and lay down   'Night again' he said lovingly. I didnt reply, i didnt need to. words couldnt express how i felt.

Chapter.   >>“Alice,” Mum called me from the bottom of the stairs, “Emily’s here!”   >>“Coming!” I called back. I grabbed my bag and headed towards the door. “Hey Emz!” I called when I saw her. “Hey, Alie, You ready?” She asked. “Yip.” I replied and pointed to the door and we walked out.   >>It was a calm, humid, the-day-before-a-storm sort of morning. We walked and talked about nothing until we reached school. School passed quickly and I walked home alone, as Emz had to go to work.   >>It was 9pm, and I was sitting on my bed reading my book: Stone Testament . Thunder was rumbling out side of my window and the house was shaking. The lights started flickering on and off so I turned them off. Then the thunder ceased and I saw the bright flash of the lightening fork. Then dead silence. It was really eerie and I was beginning to get rather anxious when the thunder hadn’t started up again 5 minutes after the lightening and I couldn‘t hear movement of any sort. Suddenly I heard this indecipherable noise, against all rational thinking, I walked out of my room, out the front the door and down this little ally-way around the corner that I knew well. I tried to stop myself but it was as though I was in a trance and I couldn’t stop myself no matter how much I tried to restrain my body from walking forward. The closer I got the louder the noise got. It sounded like singing, the most elegant, beautiful, graceful singing I’d ever heard. Yet, there was something off about the singing. I was rounded the last corner and I realised what was off about this music. It wasn’t in any language I’d ever heard. In fact it didn’t even sound remotely human. I started to shake. Then I stopped. The singing stopped. I looked around me. There was nothing there. Not one thing. I shook my head. This could NOT be happening. Maybe I’d just been sleep walking. Yes, that was it, exactly. I pinched myself to make sure I was actually awake. Yip, certainly awake. I tried to lift my feet and turn around to head back but I couldn’t. They felt like lead. Suddenly, the singing started up again. But this time I could understand it a bit better. I heard my name over and over again. I looked around trying to figure out where the noise was coming from, but I just couldn’t locate the source. My head was swirling when the singing stopped. “Hello Alice.” My head snapped up at the sound of a mans voice. I tried to speak but the words choked up in the back of my throat.
