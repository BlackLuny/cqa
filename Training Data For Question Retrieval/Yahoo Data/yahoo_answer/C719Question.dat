20090131201940AA40OpX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do my friends not invite me out cause i'm 19 and theyre all over 21?	I mean they all go out and don't even bother to ask if i wanna come anymore. I mean it all started when i was invited on a weekend trip and my parents said i couldn't go (I know i've moved out since then) and now unless its a quick trip to the movies or out to dinner i'm not invited and they barely even act like they leave the house when i know they do.
20090131202041AAQK2a1	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do i tell my friend so she'll pay me back?	About two weeks ago my friend and another friend did really mean stuff to me. We were at a sleepover and while i was sleeping, and they were giggling and excluding me, they poured soy sauce all over me, and ruined my $30 white bra. Then when i woke up i told them to stop. Later in the night they ended up    dumping a bucket of water on my face.      Now i asked my friend to pay me back like aweek ago, and she said she would a week later. So I waited,and asked her on the phone, and she hung up on me.Later, she texted me saying," i don't owe u $hit."      How do i get her to pay me back for the bra she ruined? What do i tell her?
20090131202404AAWjQ67	Family & Relationships;Family	I was a terrible child when I was little?	I'm 14 years old now and I'm getting pretty good grades (Mostly A's, and some B's) My mom told me when I was little, I was a very stubborn child. I didn't pay attention in class so I never knew how to do my homework. My mom has to bring in a tutor and they would basicly do my homework for me. I even flunked the 3rd grade. Why was I like that when I was little, when as of right now, I care soooo much about my grades?

20090131202957AAdeX2D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Adult women, S.E.X. question?	Have you ever been with a man who had trouble performing?  If so what did you say, do?  How old was he?  Why do you think it happened?   Also what about a man who can't "finnish"?
20090131202955AAY2hdM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you have any advice for me? ?	There is this boy, and he's impossible to figure out. He will flirt with any girl in sight, and I really like him. How can I tell if he likes me? I'm not sure if he's much of a risk-taker, so I don't know if he did like me if he'd even ask me out! I'm afraid of rejection, so I find it really hard to tell people when I like them. I'm not sure what I'm asking, but if anything, I'd just like some sort of advice. What would you do? Please & thanks.

20090131202900AApnVOt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Can I Tell If He likes me.?	There is a boy in spanish class who use to sit by me, but then we moved. But when we sat by each other, he would always came up with something to talk to me. He texts me a lot and we talk a lot on MSN. He is usually the one to start the conversations but i sometimes start it. The only problem is that my friends say that i shouldn't date him cause he is not hot enough for me. Plus he gets teased a lot. Like the other day we were listening to a song that had a cow in it that had really big lips. There were saying that the boy and girl in the video looked like the hottest couple dating. He then asked who was the cow and all said him. My reaction was i just wanted it to stop so i said nothing. He doesn't talk to me during break and lunch only during class, sometimes after skool and every night. I mean we talk about anything. But recently he found out that his parents were getting a divorces. I don't him to go through any more pain. But i can't really tell if he likes me or just wants to be really good friends can anyone help me.

I recently broke up with my live-in boyfriend of 3 years, it will take about 2 months for him to find a new place to live. The lease is under my name only. Now i met this new guy living around my neighbourhood, he is great and charming. Should i tell him about my live-in arrangement, or should i say i am single? Since my ex is still living with me, i can't bring my new friend home out of respect.
20090131115016AA1jsLm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	It seems kinda fishy......?	My husband's ex-wife sent an email demanding he pay her child support by email transfer (keep in mind they have shared custody, exactly equal time with the kids and he still pays).  He said he'd really rather pay child support in checks because he has half custody of the kids so he needs to protect his funds because the kids rely on it and doesn't want her saying she never received the money (you'd be surprised how unsecure email transfer are, I work in finance with a major bank and I KNOW the ins and outs).  She absolutely freaked out and threatened court.  Anyway, we noticed the support checks come out of our account on the 2nd of the month and the checks are dated for the 1st, so there's no hold at all.  What's up with her fishy behaviour?  It was weird.
20090131092310AA4WPtZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it normal for your dad to call you a mother ****** everyday?	my dad is an asshole.  There isn't really any other way to put it.  I've dealed with this all my life, so its nothing new, but it just gets SO OLD after a while...my dad is always depressed, and angry.  He's an alcoholic, he drinks about 3 to 4 times a week, and the days he isn't drinking are because hes to hungover.  I love my dad don't get me wrong, and i know he loves me, but his mood swings are so frustrating.  When he drinks  he causes DRAMA thats what drinking brings you. He'll come home and pick a fight.  Years ago, hes broken lights in the garage, he's threw a computer screen on the floor and smashed it, and hes gotten a beer bottle cracked on his head at a bar, for acting like a fool.  Also he always says to either me, my mom, or my brothers that hes tired of all of us mother *******, hes no good, we'll never get a dime out of him, we are all mother *******. then this morning he was acting hella crabby, and i was like oh dad i'm going to my friends house tonight and were going to the movies, but i can have either you or mom pick me up in the morning and he goes "WHY ARE YOU GOING, WHATS THE REASON!!!?" and i said "what the hell is your problem?" and he goes" I DON'T LIKE ANY OF YOU MOTHER *******!!!!" and then he peeled out of the driveway.    I just don't know what i did to deserve being treated like this.  I get straight A's and B's, I've never smoked, I've never drank, i'm very responsible, i clean the house all the time, i do everything.  but i don't get any slack for it.  growing up with an alcoholic dad makes me want to stay away from that kind of life, and be a good person.  and thats what i do. i'm 16 years old, well i will be on friday, even though my birthday's coming up its like he doesn't even care.  its so frustrating, and it makes me so sad =[ i just don't know what i did to deserve this

If you were poor, I would of loved you anyways. If you were fat, I would of loved you anyway, but if I never saw your face again or heard you speak my name, I would of never loved again!"    I want to find him so badly.  I want him to know how I feel, because I never told him. I love him. And I never knew exactly how much until he left.

I get along with guys easy enough, but none of them see me as anything more than a friend. I'm starting to get really depressed about it and my self confidence has plummeted.

20090131144645AAp3xe6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it a bad thing to refuse to have a joint bank account with a g/f or wife?	I've known several guys who got their bank accounts drained by their wives when they left home. The men couldn't do anything about it since the wife was on the account. I've also known men who were cohabitating with a girlfriend who cleaned out their home after a break up. In one instance the ex-g/f showed up with a U-Haul while he was at work and took furniture, TV, electronics, etc. She left a note saying she was moving out. The police said they couldn't do anything. That it was a civil case and must be settled in court.
20090131144709AAKKFgR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you deal with a breakup?	Been with my bf for 5 years, lately Im feeling like I need a break to help me think straight, be by myself for a while, re-evaluate our relationship and all that.   So I told him we needed to go on a break and I need to really think how I feel about him, and theres a chance we might not get back together.   Now Im doing ok, I get depressed from time to time when I remember how he reacted (completely and utterly heartbroken but supportive or what makes me happy)   What would you do if this was you? Is it wrong for me to be tempted to contact him to see if he's ok? Cuz I do still love him and dont want him to be completely miserable cuz I know he is.   He doesnt tlk to anyone else about serious things other than me.   So while I have a lot of friends supporting me, he has no1 and is probably sitting at home by himself in the dark as we speak.   I feel so very very bad for him and Im trying not to let how miserable he is without me effect my decision to get back or not when it comes to it.      Any advice at all would be much appreciated!   xx

20090131131814AAv36Gx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my bf using me to watch his kids?	My boyfriend and I live together with his two kids. He works everyday all afternoon and night. so basically i'm with the kids after school till like midnight or later. and on weekends all day long! their biological mother lives in another state and doesn't really do anything except a phone call or visit once a while. i'm only 23 and i feel way too young to be stuck in house raising a 12 and 5 year old. I'm constantly stressed, because I'm always yelling and i have absolutely no privacy or time for myself. i feel as if i'm being taken advantage of because i'm not working. i'm having trouble finding a job after graduating college even in retail.  so i'm home all day, everyday looking on the internet for jobs. i've told him i'm not happy with our living situation but nothing seems to change. i've asked to get help and have other family members watch them or get a babysitter. i feel like i'm going crazy. i'm stuck in house raising another woman's children. i'm wondering if he's using me cuz he definitely benefits from having me there.    if anyone is in a similar living situation or has any thoughts/advice i would appreciate it.

20090131144816AAztrFG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you have been mad....got ditched...?	So, I have a 10 month old daughter and my friend has a 4 month old son. She's been begging me for so long to "Go out, and have fun together."...So, I finally after 10 months of being around my daughter night and day, got the courage to go out with her. We met up with some folks and went to one of our "mutual" friend's house. This "mutual" friend used to be a really close friend of mine, but has since basically quit talking to me, so now it's just a "Hey, how are you"...and that's about it. Anyways my friend that had been asking for me to go out was all on my case about why I wasn't getting totally trashed. I said..."I have a 10 month old to go home to in a little while and I can't be incapacitated when I get home"....So, I guess she saw it as a "weakness" since she feels it okay..(being a mom) to still get totally F'd up whenever she's out. I'm not like that...and I hate it when people act that way, but what happened was, the "mutual" friend started talking to the other friend of mine and was like.."You can stay here with me and get "crunk" tonight.."....and she just stayed with her and was like "You won't be mad, right?"..and of course I wasn't going to beg her to stay with me and hang some more, but jeez I would have never done that. She's the one who's been planning to go out with ME for months and months and it seems like just because I didn't want to get Sh*t faced...I get ditched...would you have been mad if someone ditched you?..I don't feel so much mad as I feel disappointed, but still. What should I say to her?

I haven't heard from him all week which didn't really worry me but now on his myspace his profile has been edited on his "about me" saying he's dead. I asked his best friend if he'd written it (because it said "written by a friend") and he has no f*cking clue either. He can't get ahold him as well..... If I don't hear from him by saturday I'm going to walk to his house after my archery lesson but well, I dunno. :[      I know he's been getting in a lot of fights with his mum and random people, like real fights I should add that I'm an hour and a half away from home until late friday night. D: I have called his cell twice today and texted a  few times. My friend called his house phone for me (I couldn't find a quiet place where I could make a phone call) and there was no answer there either! I found that to be really odd because his mum is always home unless she's drunk or with one of her psycho friend. DDD:

20090131150039AAxeZav	Family & Relationships;Friends	A friend that I'm not so sure about...?	I have this one friend, lets call her "Sarah". Well anyways, Sarah and I have been friends since kindergarten (we are in 7th grade now). She always has been WAY more outgoing than me, and way more "attention-needing" I guess you could say. She makes friends very easily, while I'm not as outgoing. Lately, she has been getting on my nerves. She is always subtly putting me down, she will just say little comments like "omg you loser..." and stuff like that. She doesn't mean it as a big deal but it just really grates on me after a while. Do you have any suggestions? I don't want to lose her as a friend, because she is a really good person, she just doesn't seem to appreciate me as a friend. All suggestions are appreciated, thanks!      Hugs&kisses,   Adrian

20090131150744AAbGFBd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PoLL: Women with kids I need your opinions?	My mom remarried when I was 7 years old to my step-dad. I am 22 now.    Specifically I want input from Women with kids with a husband that is not their dad. I would ask my mom but she lies too much. And I re-posted this from another category this category has more people on it constantly.    The thing is, when I was younger my mom made me call my step-dad "Dad." Even though he only provided for me and never talked to me or anything. I cannot remember any time ever that I had a conversation with him that lasted anymore than 5 minutes. Anytime I talked to him it's always been for interaction for doing things. It's just always business. Never father son type talks. No talks about drinking beer, women, cars, sports, firearms, computers, or news. I can remember one talk about some political stuff on TV one time though.    He never called me "son" either. I have lived under the same roof with him as my step-dad for about a decade, and I have never heard him called me son, even though I call him dad all the time. It's always by my first name.    But my mom still wants me to call him dad, and she tells all her acquaintances at work that he's my real dad. WTF is up with that. Can't she accept that he is my step-dad. It's like she wants some wish to metastasize and he will be my real dad and all.    The older I get the more I don't like him. He still has not called me son, even though I call him dad. It's not fair.    So my question is, whey does my my mom lie to people that he is my real dad and wants me to call him dad? (She doesn't know that he never called me son.)

20090131150218AAoEvMy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	PAREN'TS MIGHT GET A DIVORCE!!! WHAT TO DOOO!??!PLEASE HELP!?	so I'm 19 and I have a 14 year old brother. My parent's have been happily married for almost 21 years and now all of a sudden things have taken a turn for the worst. My mom has been really sick and just had a surgery and my dad recently foudn out he has diabetes. My dad is 54 and my mom is 46 so they are both still pretty young. After her surgery, my mom felt like my dad was not consoling towards her at all and did not assist her and he claims he did and that is the root of this problem. It has escalated into both of them saying " divorce" but everytime  i talk to my dad he just says " everything is going to be okay" But my mom says " i want out and i can't take living with him anymore 20 years has been enough!!!" I'm absolutely terrified becasue this would totally change EVERYTHING!!! I just don't know what I can do because I am away from home at college and my brother doesn't want to say anything because he is too scared to talk about it. My grandma keeps telling me to get them to talk but my mom is super stubborn and wants nothing to do with him. She says my dad is just bveing rude while she is sick ( there have been complications with the surgery and she's been in bed for a month) and that he is saying he wants out and that he's soldthe house and stuff. The problem is idon't know if this is reality or if she's just saying it...because my mom is very overdramatic!!! I'm soooo scared and know this is someting petty that could be resolved if they both pulled their head's out of their asses!!! please help me! what should i do????
20090226081628AAoEApI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm falling for a girl way out of my league?	There's this girl in my class who's smart, funny, beautiful and is active in human rights affairs! Think Darfur, Burma, etc.       So yeah, I'm pretty active in Human Rights stuff too and I invited her to a meeting and we started talking about how important this kind of stuff was and why so many ppl are apathetic...she gave me her number, came to this big event, and it was good.      I think I'm starting to fall for her...the problem is, she's definitely out of my league. She's pre-med, I'm physics, different worlds. I've been with girls almost as hot as her but...they were kinda annoying, and this girl is the whole package, and thus, a LOT more out of my league.      The only thing I've got going is that she can see my "sensitive" side, but usually amazing girls go for jerks and a*holes. But I have this feeling she might be smart enough to see through them...but probably not.      So...what do I do? Should I just give up?

It was so inviting to do so :D       I REALLY like her which she obviously knows BUT do you think shes interested in me?

20090131150937AAxBoaj	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think my friend may have been Sexually abused when he was younger?	please dont say I am jumping to conclusions.      I was telling my friend about a movie I was watching about a guy who raped a child. and how I had to stop watching it because it made me angry.      When we started talking about the movie he kept cursing the man who raped the kids.      Then after a bit he started saying that If he ever got ahold of a man who sexually abused or raped a child No one would want to see the man after,(I know he wouldnt hurt anyone really but it made him upset to talk about it) It was on aol messanger. after a bit of talking he said he had to go. and then just jumped off without giving me time to say goodbye or anything. which is unusual for him.      This is the 3rd Time we talked about something like this and it upset him(so i do avoid trying to talk about things like this to him)   Do you think he was hurt or do you think he is just hurt by children being sexually abused and raped. He also has 2 nieces that he loves alot. so i thought it might be because he lives with a child(he lives with his sister and her husband) that he might feel strong about it.      I am worried about him. he is 23 years old.      Please dont say I am jumping to conclusions our other conversations were a bit different and more leading to my thinking then this one.      please help. I love my friend so much, and it bothers me to think he might have been hurt.      Thanks      Mad_CatZ      any help you can give me to feel better?   Its been bothering me for about 2 days now(since the last time we talked online) please help      also he is a sweet boy. usually happy. but I am still a bit concerned.

It was my first time actually making out with a guy. It wasn't such a great experience, i mean freaking out in the middle of making out and like not knowing what to do anymore. :S We kind of talked about it later. I told him he really caught me off guard, which is pretty much why it didn't go so well. I'll probably see him soon again, but i'm not sure how i'll react. He told me he didn't want to make out if i didn't want to. But i actually do. I just don't want to freak out again. What should i do next time, or what should i tell him?

My mom, my boyfriend and I were talking about our weekend plans this afternoon. He hung out with his two girlfriends and one guy friend last night, and this Saturday night and tomorrow is our time together, and I don't see anything wrong with that. She, however, does, and I don't understand why. I'm just like him in that I don't enjoy meshing my groups of people. Group A sticks to group A and so-forth. I HAVE met these particular friends and they're very nice. He's invited me to do other things together and I've accepted. WHAT in the world is going on in my mom's head to make her think that it's alright to lose your identity whilst in a relationship whereby the two of you do eeeverything together alll the time? I will NEVER date a man who is okay in telling waitresses, "Oh, -we- don't eat ketchup with our fries." It's like ... dude, YOU can eat ketchup if you want, you know??      What a strange, strange generation. I can't help to worry though that her wisdom has something on me and that I should be worried that he didn't invite me last night. Now she's got me paranoid ... argh.

I act distant and unhappy because I think if I get too close and act happy and in love then I will feel stupid if our relationship ends.  My fiance' and I have been together for about 3 yrs. now and about a year into our relationship, I dropped my guard to fully let him in and I was able to put my full trust into him the 1st time my entire life.  This last year, he has hurt me numerous of times, he has lied to me and put me down time after time.  So now, my defense mechanism has come back out.  I am being very distant with him, unhappy, irritated and questioning our relationship.  Our wedding is supposed to be in 7 months and I don't know if I can marry someone if I can't trust him.

Now I'm not so sure because: 1) my maid of honor said it was cheesy and 2) it makes me cry every time I hear it, and I don't want to be a crying mess during our dance!      My second choice is Stand By Me by Ben E. King, it's a fun, more upbeat song and I'm sure it'll mean just as much to my father and I, but it won't make me bawl like a baby (hopefully).      Any advice?   Thanks!

I have a current girlfriend that I thinking of leaving because i feel like we dont have enough in common.We have some good times together but half of the time it's been bad because we argue alot.

20090226083202AAWjvoV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Some honest opinions/advice please?	My now husband and I knew each other for 4 years before we got married...its been 5 months since we got married. We lived for a year together before this. In that year I knew that though my bf was a very loving caring person...he just lacked some of my expectations.       I am a cleanliness freak....and I have been told so my my ex roomies, my parents..an especially my bro!      And from my 1 year stay with my bf...I found that he happens to be one of the most clutter creating person I have come across. Now I said to myself that it will change n improve etc. But now its been 6 months after marriage and its worse.      I work full time, cook, clean, pick up after him all the time. Its just too much. He is honest, hard working kind but does nothing to help me around. All he knows is gym, tv and work. If he wants dinenr he will just say he is hungry and I cook n serve n pick up dishes and clean everything before we go to bed every night. I do laundry, fold, iron the clothes, I vaccum, shop for grocery, clean bathrooms. He once told me he does not liek to see dirty dishes in the basin. So everytime I use any I rinse n put them in the dish washer. But when he keeps those in there its ok. If i tell him he gets mad.      This all seems so much childish bickering.      Yesterday I told him why does he not do so..n he tells me he never expects me to do things and that I do them anyway and then expect him to do things.      I was like wtf?       I am so angry n depressed n hurt.      I cannot even say I love him because I am so upset...      What should I do?      I feel all the work I do around gets no appreciation. But if i dont do it who will?         People say communicate...our communication is only fighting.      WHAT TO DO?

20090131151915AAj640S	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would it be inappropriate to bring my boyfriend of almost 5 months to a wedding in Venice, Italy?	It's one of my best friend's weddings and she's letting me bring a plus one. I want to bring him because a) my parents will be there and he's only met them once b) he's also kind of friends with the bride and c) i think it'd be a lot of fun! The wedding is like a 3 day long thing: on Thursday everyone settles in and gets acquainted. Friday is the rehearsal dinner and a day for other guests that aren't apart of the bridal party to explore the city and Saturday is the acutal wedding.      We both 22, we don't have sex and we're not planning on it unless we get married so we'd be staying in different rooms. I just want to make sure it's completely appropriate. Thoughts?      p.s. we were friends in college for 2 years before we started dating and we were also classmates in middle/high school.

If you're a horny lady, you don't count on this question.  I'd like to hear from the typical medium or low-sex women...

20090226082919AALlDAo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my wife keep changing the requirements?	Many years ago I asked her why we don't have sex more often.  She said she was too tired.  So I started helping out much more around the house and with the kids.  Then I asked her again a few years later and she said we didn't connect and I never suggest anything.  So I planned some dates and vacations and time alone with her every night.  Still nothing.  On her last birthday, I researched all the theater shows in our area and sent her a list of choices for tickets.  She deleted the email and never responded.      Then I asked her again and she said we have no common goal in life.  I suggested some ideas; we could climb mt. kilamanjaro, we could do some volunteer work, we could raise our 2 kids, we could paint the house, we could start a sake brewing business, we could have daily sex.        I'm still waiting for her response.  I'm guessing there will be a new requirement, maybe "we don't share the same DNA" or something that I can't possibly achieve.      Why does she keep raising the bar?
20090226082203AANYGvO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I quit drinking and started smoking.  Is that better?	My wife hasn't liked my drinking habits for years.  Finally I decided to give it up, and I've started smoking on the sly.  It's been going on for about a year and I don't think she knows.  I smoke at work, outside, and I get all cleaned up before going home.        My lungs are getting all baked but I'm much more relaxed, and I don't drink much anymore.  My wife thinks it's great but of course she doesn't say anything and also of course no sex anyways.  But I gave her what SHE asked for.        Is this a better scenario or should I just go back to drinking?

I have set rules but she refuses to follow them. Not to mention she shares every detail of every little fuss and squabble that my fiance and I have, with the entire family (her goal is to make him look bad). I let her move in because she was going to quit college. I talked her in to moving in with me and attending a local community college and she found a full time job that she loves.  I know if I make her move out she will have to quit her job and quit school. There is no where in the area that she could afford to live on her own. I want her to succeed in life without ruining mine!!! HELP! What can I do?

Love kids, wanted to know if I could make enough money fostering to devote my life to it and quit my job?   I currently work with developmently disabled adults full time and worked as a caregiver ***. for children 0-3years for 4 years. We just bought our first home and it's rather large, if I am going to foster I want to do it full time, so I can devote my life to the children, so I was wondering if anyone knew how much money the state of michigan pays per child. Not because that's what I'm after, I don't care about money like that, it's for the kids, but like I said, I want to do it full time and I still have bills.
20090226083233AAkMzlO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Hey, I know this isn't a question but i just want cheering up on here...?	Hey,   I would talk to my friends but i don't want to bother them.      I'm 15 and my Mum and Dad died a few years ago. As a result of this i now live with my auntie and uncle and they are christians. This means they are strict and i have to go to church which i'm not a big fan of.    I heard my auntie talking earlier on the phone about me because i always answer questions with 'I don't know'. It's not that i don't know, just that i am shy and i don't want to say what i want or how i feel so the safest way is to say i don't know.   Anyway, she is very strict and earlier when she was on the phone she didn't even make an effort to keep her voice down while saying bad stuff about me. It upset me and annoyed me and i just wanted someone to talk to. I sound like a stupid young girl, i know, but just cheer me up?      Thanks.

20090131151414AARC5Hg	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Men's engagement ring?	I recently purchased my boyfriend this ring:    http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...       That's a diamond, not a cubic zirconia. I've told him that it's a promise ring (all he knows is that I'm getting him it for Valentine's Day, but does not know it has a diamond on it).   We've very serious and pretty much have told each other want to plan marriage in the future.      My question is, would you consider this ring as an engagement ring, considering it has a diamond on it?   I have received a promise ring myself, but it has Austrian crystals on it. When my boyfriend gave it to me, it was a symbol of monogamy.   Would it be inappropriate if I did propose this as an engagement ring?

Is it my looks, or just that I'm shy?       http://picasaweb.google.com/shelbypusz/S...       (you can click on the pics if necessary)

If you denied the good guy wich was your friend because you had a bf who hits you and treated you bad and wanted to stay with the bad guy, and you stop talking (She had sex with him at age 15)& years later you see your bestfriend that would have treated you like a queen rolling by and saying hi in a lamborghini and rich.

20090131161927AAQ3UFb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get this guy to ask me out?	Well I really like this guy and we hang out in study hall every day, but that's about the only time I see him.

I was walking with my friend in the hallway and he was staring at her (he knows that she likes her) but then he brushed up against my arm, I was like wtf?! Who does he like me or her? He's not a player and he thinks that she likes him. He thinks I like his brother.
20090131154928AAJWSuY	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How much for these bouquets?  How many blooms in each?	I've decided on Carnations for my wedding flowers because they are the only flower I really like and I want my bouquet to match my custom made wedding dress, which will have a rosy pink sash and bows.  My bridesmaids will be in black dressed with dark cranberry red sashes (it's a Christmas theme).        So I thought the bridesmaids could have dark red carnations and I could have pink or white with pink tips/edges.      I need 5 bouquets (4 bridesmaids plus me) and 7 boutonnieres (groomsmen plus dads) and then 2 corsages for the moms.      If everything is carnations, how much do you think it would cost?      How many blooms in each bouquet are needed for a full looking bunch?  I'm a very petit person (5'2")  12? 15? 20? 30?      I'm not really a "flower person" so I don't know much about bouquets or the prices of this type of thing.  I want a good idea of price range before I go looking for a florist and getting quotes.      Thanks!

20090131152908AAo2kOr	Family & Relationships;Friends	I really need advice. My best friend....?	Last night she sent me some really scary texts. It was about 11:30 and she messaged me on facebook saying I HATE MY LIFE I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF, then signed off. I didn't take it seriously, she has a good life, lots of friends, she's always crazy and happy she gets upset but not that often she has a mom and a step dad although her parents got divorced when she was reallllly young. so it wasn't that traumatic.  anyway.      then later that night, she texted me and said she is telling everyong she knows that she loves them but God wants her with him now, too many lies she can't take it anymore, goodbye and I love you...      and i was like WHAT? so i texted back you're not serious?! then I called her. she didn't answer, just texted back.. seriously, don't call. It's my time.   so i called her house phone, it was lik emidnight and i knew id wake her parent but i did not matter! she picked up. I was like ARE YOU SERIOUS? and she was like, sigh. noo. and i was like WHY woudl you send those messages then. and she was like it's just how i feel. and i told her to talk to me about it and she said i wouldn't understand. and i said it didn't matter but she has to talk to someone. and she said also that she wouldnt ACTUALLY do anything. but I don't know. If she's thinking like that. I   m just very skeptical because those messages were horrible. If she hadn't picked up her phone i would have called 911. I can't understand how anyone could think that way.      so this mornign I called her to talk about it. She said she felt a lot better, it was a hard night and she needed to sleep. and I already knew this, but her dad is very sick, he has been for years. Apparently last night she had been told he would die soon. She is afraid of loosing him and is over reacting to this fear and thinking she will loose all her friends and everyone she loves. I made sure she knew how much so many people love her and that she could always talk to me about anything and she is feelign better, but I'm scared for her. Has anyone ever lost a parent at this age (15) what would you have wanted to hear? Has anyone been in my situation before? Please give me some advice. She is one of my best friends.

20090131160201AAieK0z	Family & Relationships;Family	I Cannot Stand My Dad Anymore...?	My parents are legally separated, however there has been a delay in some of the divorce plans (due to financial and legal issues), so right now, my entire family is still living together (although my mom doesnt stay around much, she's usually staying at her boyfriends house half the week).  But i seriously cant stand living with my dad anymore.  When i was younger (from the ages of about 2-8) he would physically abuse me, smacking, hitting me on the face, and kicking me across the room.  He has since stopped this physical abuse, but continues to verbally abuse us.  He yells at us for everything and anything. And the thing is, he picks on me more than my sisters.  He has always treated me differently (i am the oldest, 17yrs old). When he's not yelling at us, he is hiding away up in his room.  Hes never been involved in my life.  And now he wonders why i hold so much resentment to him.  I honestly try avoiding him at all costs. All he talks about is money.  He shut us off our gym memberships, calls me a spoiled brat when i ask him to go to the grocery store, and refuses to buy us things we need (my grandmother once had to buy us pads and tampons bc my father refused)  Ive talked to my mom about this.  I feel really close to her, but it stinks shes never around.  I understand that she cant stand to be around my dad, but i feel abandoned in a way.  Am i over-reacting to all this? And the thing that bothers me the most is that he is fighting for custody over us because he claims my mother to be unfit?  I am scared i am going to have to live with him.  What do i do?

20090131163344AAzhf6Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about my ex?	I have a 2 month old son and his father only comes around maybe once every two weeks. When he comes he is awake for about 2 hours then goes to sleep and when he finally does wake up he leaves. My ex curtis and i dated when we were younger and i just spoke to him today and he tells me if my son's biological father wont be around to support him he said he will. i don't want curtis to do that because i feel like that's not his child and he shouldn't have to do that. curtis also mentioned to me that if i didn't get pregnant by my son's father (my current "boyfriend". things are going so well with him) he said that my son would have been his. i know he still has feelings for me and i don't know if he is trying to get close to my son just to get close to me or if he really means it. i know you really wont be able to tell me if this is true or not but i would appreciate if you could just tell me your opinions from what i just told you. am i wrong for thinking something is up?  thanks.

20090131155548AAO7nVw	Family & Relationships;Family	Does this ever happen to you?	Your walking around somewhere and as you walk you see everyone with all these fashion branded clothes shoes and accessories. I t wouldn't bother you as much if you could afford them too. But the fact is that you don't have the money and even if you tried to get it you couldn't because your stuck in a corner and near the tip of a hill were you take one step forward your doomed and one step back means your time is getting nearer even if you don't make a move.   How does it feel to know that your father was once a diplomat and you used to live in luxury but now that his time has finished your mother sacrifices to stay in the country for your your education while your father moves back. Being dreaded by the fact that your not legal but the government knows your here due to court cases to get you rpapers. Meanwhule, your being bullied at school for your race nationality and things you don't have. The reason you don't have friend sis because you don't dress like them or as you might say you are not "fresh". So for everyday of your life you must dwell with all the pain and arguments that your family has and do nothing else but......wait.

My boyfriend wants to have a superbowl party at our house. So I said cool, I would cook some food and serve the guests. But, he said, no, he wanted to have the house to himself with his buddies for a dude-get-together. (I am 7months pregnant, and he wants to have some fun before the baby is born)      I was kind of mad, cuz I felt like he didnt want me around, but I understand his view, so I told him I would go shopping, or go watch the super bowl somewhere else while he hangs out.....      Anyways, he went behind my back and MADE PLANS FOR ME with his co-worker and his wife...for me to hang out at his co-workers wife at home with her and her kids. She doesn't even like foot ball, and I had already told her I like foot ball and was planning on watching the game. So, I feel kinda belittled, like he is acting like he owns me. I dunno. Maybe its the hormones! But I AM NOT gunna sit at home like a bored house wife with someones 3 kids while he has all the fun!       I told him I didnt like that he did that, can he said "Well, we already had it all planned." I told him I felt like he was acting like I was his property, he just ended up hanging up on me without answering. I just feel disrespected. He doesnt get it.

Does he need more time?  He have told me that he like me a lot  before and he's happy that Im in his life.

20090131163351AAD9uXB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Read This! I Need Good Advice!! =D?	This guy pulled me up to the dance floor and slow danced with me, my first time ever. He was an amazing dancer, just leading so smoothly. I've never really danced before, but I've seen thousands of people in my lifetime do it. He commented on how I was doing really great and even said most girls would be tripping all over themselves by that point. He also made a point of saying "I just totally changed the steps and you followed along perfectly!" To me, it seemed completely perfect, out bodies gently pressed against each other, nothing disgusting. He was smiling and laughing the whole time we were up there, and so was I. After the song was over, he was laughing sweetly and gave me a big hug, where my hand fell on his chest. Could a girl ask for a better moment?       So, I'm the type of girl who's always the friend, and only that. I haven't liked any guys for over 8 months, and ever since that so-simple dance last night, I'm so confused about my feelings. I can't stop thinking about it, but that's the problem. I don't think I should like him because I otherwise have a difficult time talking to him because for some reason I get nervous and awkward around him. Anyone have any tips on what to do? Thank's for caring =)      I'm 17, and never had a boyfriend.

My basement is the only place where my mother is letting me have it. Our basement is COVERED in boxes, and every time I try to clean up, or AT LEAST make it look presentable, my step father and her yell at me, telling me that "don't do that, because you don't know where all of that goes." So  I say "why don't we all do this together so I can help"   they say "no no, just go clean ur room, we'll take care of it"   I come back down to the basement and worked my butt off in my room, to find my mom sleeping on the couch, and my step dad eating pizza and watching the news. I asked "So um since we have a lot to do, did u guys do anything?"   and he said "nope"   I got so frustrated that I stormed over and woke up my mom, I told her that " I was SICK of YOU ALWAYS PROCRASTINATING! WE HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR 2 YEARS AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE JUST MOVED IN A WEEK AGO! GROW UP AND START ACTING LIKE A REAL MOM!"    she doesn't do shi*t for me! She always *****$ at me.

I DO A LOT, AND IM SICK, SO I CAN'T DO THAT MUCH!".....   HONESTLY i'm about to jump off my roof. I don't know what to do, and I KNOW she's being a lazy mother. I'm crying, I don't know what to do!

20090131161053AAvAEzQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why won't he date me if he seems to act like he wants to?	Ok so the guy I've liked now for about 5 months is very confusing. We became best friends really fast and then more then friends and then it became a drunken hook up thing b/c he didn't want a girl friend. It was all very confusing. So I asked him what was up and he said he didn't want a girl friend. So I asked him if he had feelings toward me more than friendship and he said he didn't know. So finally I was like ok how do your feelings toward me compare with that of my roommate and he was like o well I guess I do like you. A week before that he told my friend he liked me. So I told him that I want space to get over him so we can be friends. Well later that week during finals, I was staying in my friend's room b/c my roommate had an early final and he ends up sleeping in bed with me and we end up making out. Which is weird b/c I believe he just said he wasn't sure if he liked me?      Then we went home for break and we talked here and there. He was studying aborad for our short winter J term, but we video chatted once a week. And everytime he got drunk he left me long messages on facebook about how he missed me and really wished we could talk. Then he called me the other day, from the other side of the world!! We talked for like 2 hours! I dunno, but if I wasn't into someone I wouldn't waste time on my trip to call them.      On top of that he calls me "hun, babe, and darling" all the time, he's always there for me when I need him w/e it might be for, he'll text me to see if I want him to pick up anything from the store and never expects me to pay him back, and he tells me he's so glad he met me b/c w/o me he'd feel lost. He's coming home tomorrow and said I'd be his first phone call once he lands.      What is going on here? I'm so confused! Help!

20090131161041AALCO56	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I convince my parents to get me a car?	Okay I have a semi-unique situation.  I can't get a job because my parents won't let me.  I NEED a car not only for school (I can't take the bus because I do all these extra curricular activities after school everyday), but also to hang out with people.  My parents pick me up from school everyday.  Also, it's really hard to get to my parents' expectations.  It's hard to keep up with my grades and extracurricular activities because I don't have a car.  I've told them that and they still won't buy me a car.  I've used every tactic I know.  And no, they CAN afford a car.  They have more than enough money to buy one for me.  The reason they aren't buying me a car IS NOT because they want me to earn it.  I need it ASAP because February is the most busy month for me.  How can I convince them? (And I don't want those "oh you have to work for your car" people answering.  I just want to know what I can say/do to get a car).

(okay just to be clear, i don't want any smart *** remarks about my husband and i,)       So i am an adult, and my mother wont allow me in the house to see my sisters until she sees the hole completely closed.       So i debated taking the 40.00 piercing out, and decided that if i was to take it out now, what other things could she hold over my head? If i decide to do something she doesnt like, is she going to hold my family hostage until i do whatever she wants me to do? My husband thinks if i take my lip ring out now, i will be loosing,and she will be winning, free to continue to take over my life.       She pulled the same bullcrap when cris and i got married as well.      I don't know what is going to end her reign of terror. Will she continue to think its okay to control me?
20090131160531AAWzfrY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would this sound ok to say this...?	I want to imply to my crush that he should ask me to the dance that's coming up.  What should I do to suggest this or to imply that I like him?      How does this sound?      me: "So, are you going to the dance blah blah blah?"   him: "No, blah blah blah... how about you?"   me: "Oh, well I was going to go, but I don't know... I think I'm only going to go if someone asks me since I don't want to go alone blah blah blah"      ^_^      Does that sound ok?  What else could I do?  We are both 16 btw...
20090131155620AA7oFuq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problem just hear me out?	Ok so there are the 3 boys that are all friends and they alll like me. they all text me and we have all hung out before... ok so the ones (1st) sister told me that he like me and not to say anything and then the other boy (2nd)  im friends with his sister and she told me he liked me... The other boy the 3rd likes me and calls me baby all the time and stuff and gives me hugs.  Okay so I like the first one I have liked for awhile but I told them all that I don't want a boy friend when secretly I really really like him... People in our one class asked him if he liked me and and his face got all red (last year though) But don't you think it would be awkward if i went out with him when his best friends like me also? I no confusing!
20090131155520AAwdfXj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help! why would he act like this?	We had been close friends for a while, he has a girlfriend and things got messed up when we both made the mistake of kissing each other. after that he dissappeared, ignored me completely and stopped talking to me. after two months of silence, he apologizes and says that he was scared of his feelings that grew and wants to go back to being friends. i was cool with that because i valued his friendship more than anything. i text him and we will have a good convo and then out the blue, he will just stop without saying bye. but when i dont text him he asks me why i dont text, and tells me to call him sometimes. and when i call, i never get an answer. i asked him if he feels awkward and he assured me that everything was cool. he called me once but it seems like im always the one texting and calling and sometimes when i do text him, he doesnt answer. what should i do? Did he lose interest or what??

20090131155643AAZyRtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Gf oblivious to classmate flirting with her?	I have recently found out that a guy in my gfs class (we're both 17 @ UK college) is always flirting and getting cosy with her, from what she's said and what I hear from other people. Tickling, hugging out of the blue, always sits beside her, play fighting, asking suggestive things, buying small presents, suggesting suggestive things, randomly touching her and poking, asking her to sit on his lap and all that. When me and her are together and he walks past, he always gives me what I think is a nasty glare.      When I told her I was getting very uncomfortable with all that going on she seemed totally clueless to why I was annoyed and when I said I was pretty sure he had a big crush on her, she just laughed and said he already had a girlfriend and he knew she wasn't single either.      Before I found out, a lot of her classmates would also look at me strangely, now since I found out how shes behaving with this guy, I think they think I'm being played like an idiot.      In your opinion, do you think she would know perfectly well whats going on, or is she just really naieve?

20090131155230AAspmjr	Family & Relationships;Family	My brother is constantly being mean to my parents...?	My brother is 6 years old and in grade 1.   For the past few months (but it's gotten drastically worse in the past month) he has been yelling, screaming, crying, and throwing tantrums at my parents.   He feels like he's the "bad kid" because my 9 year old sister and I hardly ever get in trouble.   He'll swear at my parents (my dad in particular... I think this is because my mom is more strict and he feels like he can't get mad at her) and call them all the swear words he knows.   They'll send him up to his room for a time out and now they've started taking away his privileges like watching TV and getting dessert.   Lately my dad and him have been screaming at each other and my house is miserable.    I'm worried the neighbors think we're all crazy....   My mom always cries and my sister and I feel awful.   Is there anything you guys recommend to get him to stop this horrible behavior? Have you had any similar experiences like this one?   I can't take it anymore... uughhhhh
20090131163417AAvO9TE	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I get him to talk to me again?	Well, I had a good friend, we called him Z-Man, and we used to talk about everything and nothing. Pretty much anytime we got the chance. we seemed to be the closest of friends. But ever since he has made cooler friends than me, we barely talk anymore. I mean, he doesn't completely ignore me, but I said hi to him a few days ago, and he just looked at me like I was an idiot. I have heard of "moving on" but I don't want that to be the case. but I don't want to appear as if I am jealous. I don't know if I should talk to him, what do I do?
20090131162245AATtuzh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Good conversation openers?	Ok right now I am reading "How to Win Friends & Influence People" and I'm also on Day 9 of the "Stylelife Challenge" ("The Rules of the Game" by Neil Strauss). I'm having problems with getting conversations started, I can't think of any conversation openers besides one about who lies more men or women. I would greatly appreciate it if someone would supply me with a few interesting conversation openers preferabbly opinion openers. It would also be great if I can get some advice on how to overcome approach anxiety.
20090131161224AAHlgsg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice! I'm so confused and so bad at understanding guys!?	I recently met a guy who goes to my friend's college through her. We started talking through texting first after my friend gave him my number. We clicked pretty well so then I drove up to meet him one weekend. The night we hung out it was a little awkward, as most first meetings would but i didn't feel like it went bad at all.      Now, ever since then his texts are completely different. His replies are  brief and not as flirty at all. I confronted him about it and told him that if he wasn't into it, or didn't like me, that he should just be honest, it's not a big deal. He replied by saying he goes through these moods but he had a good time and would like to hang out again.      However, his texts are still very brief and emotionless and while he still initiates the texts every once in awhile, it has decreased A LOT. What is his deal?
20090131153836AAqnR9p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I doing something wrong? Teenage problem!?	I am in 8th grade and I'm 15 years old. And there is this boy I like but i don't even know if he even knows my name and he's kinda a little out of my league but i do catch him taking a look at me sometimes. Any way, we have a choice of going to a certain high school and the one he's going to is not a really good one. I have a chance to move and go to a different high school but i get sad when i think about how i won't see him anymore. Please don't tell me to get over it caus i can't help it. I love every breath he takes i love everything he does, im always thinking about him and wondering what he's doing and i love his eyes--I love everything about it him and it hurts so bad.  I even feel like i'de consider marrying him even if it means not really getting far in life ansd being broke. I don't want to have a baby in the future but he does and i feel like i would have a baby if i was with him and for him.    Do you think i would seem stupid to follow him to high school even if i know there is a great possibility that we wont be together?
20090131162813AAoDe6W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is your opinion/advice/anything?	I really don't know what the story is here. To preface I have by no means or stretch of the imagination ever been a casanova or dating fiend. My lack of dating prowess and what have you has always bothered me, as in i'd very much like to get out there and get going. More and more lately i've been hearing this from various friends (guy and girl), 'why don't you have a girlfriend?' 'all my girlfriends say you're really cute' 'I bet you've got girls all over you' etc etc, as much as i find those to be flattering, they are also upsetting, because if all these girls supposedly think i'm cute and all girls love me around, why is it that i'm single and lonely. I always hit it off very well in public, then why am i always going home alone? I've only really had feelings for like 3 girls in my life (i'm 19) have only kissed four girls in my life, i just don't know why i'm not like my friends who were just all over the place in highschool and now in college going nuts and are out dating and hooking up with the world over, but i don't feel the intrinsic drive to do so, why is that? i just get lonely big time
20090131152534AAXvh7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, does this sound like a good idea?	So, about a week ago, this cute girl was walking towards her dorm, towards me. Ive seen her before. So when she got close, I looked at her, she looked at me, took a sip of coffee and smiled at me. I was like WOAH. So next time I see her, I was thinking I just go up to her and say:   "Hello, im Matt. This may seem forward, but when you smiled at me the other day, it was the most beautiful smile I have ever seen" (which was true) then leave. Is this a good idea?

20090131161806AAsFSqL	Family & Relationships;Family	Why don't I have any desire to talk to my parents?	I'm 27. I lived with my parents till I went to college. When I went to college I just got really busy and never had time to talk to them. Afterwards I joined the army. Same thing is still going on. I just am always finding lots of stuff to do and have no desire to want to talk to my parents even though I could make some time. Now I am about to leave the army and still constantly finding stuff to do like find a job and etc etc.      When I was young my parents did beat me but no more than should probably be expected from being a crazy kid and rebellious teenager. My mother is rather uneducated and I have always detested this in the extreme. My dad is exactly the opposite. I'm the only child of a middle class family.      I feel like my parents are too clingy. They always have been. They are calling me on the phone all the time expecting me to be thrilled to listen to them talk about their mundane everyday activities. It is not like I can talk to them about the army or college or my job search. My dad is extremely set in his ways and my mother is not the brightest person I have met. So conversation is difficult.      Lately my wife has been asking me why I never talk to my parents and so that is why I am wondering to myself why I have simply no feeling for them.

20090131160314AAJjg5Y	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I say to my half sister I have never met?	I am going to make a long story short.  I have a half sister that is 21, 3 years younger than me.  I was born out of an affair.  Our father never really had much to do with me and I have never met my sister.  In 2007 our father died and I did not find out until over a year later.  When I found out, I called my dad's ex-wife, my sisters mother, to find out what had happened, etc..  It did not go over very well, and they were pretty much very rude to me.  An obvious chip on their shoulder.  I feel like my sister is very influenced by her mother not to like me.  I have considered getting in touch with her for many years.  Anyway, I sent her a friend request on myspace and I want to send her a message.  I just want to know once and for all if we might be able to have a relationship and if not, I would like her to tell me that so that I can move on.  What do you think I should say?  Do you think this is a good idea?

20090131152556AAkFrbX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know you all see this question A LOT, but please try to help me out. PLEASE!!!?	Please, I don't want to be alone for my 19th Valentine's Day in a row. That's right, I've NEVER had a valentine, or a girlfriend, for that matter. And, alright, I know that's because I'm not a very attractive man. And because of this, I'm very shy and not confident at all. What should I do?   The way I see, I think EVERYBODY, regardless of what they look like, should have somebody on Valentine's Day. Even if JUST for that one day. Come on, it's a nice holiday for couples, so what should us single people do? There's no holiday for US, is there?     Please, it's going to be an unbelievably bad day for me if I'm alone, again. Is there anything in the world I can do??? Please, I'm desperate. Thank you so much!!

20090131153932AA7hPMX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be mad that my boyfriend works with his ex?	I started dating this guy I really like and it's the first time I'm in a long distance relationship so it's definitely different but we manage to see each other every week-end. The thing is he wanted to be completely honest with me and confessed that he worked with his ex from 2 years ago. She had cheated on him and he's hated her ever since. I understand I can't control the situation, but it kinda bugs me. I already expressed my discomfort towards the situation and he apologized for it, but pointed out that he couldn't help it if she had applied at the same place he was at. Should I keep complaining or just let it go in hopes that it won't bug me anymore?

We are friends and we flirt on and off..but he never makes any moves on me, so I just never really thought he was intrested like that. Then acouple of weeks ago.. It was rather random, but I found out that he had framed a photo of him and I, and then when he saw me..he didnt even say hello to me, he was just like.." I Framed That Photo Of You And I" and I really didnt know how to respond. When I asked him about it..he told me it makes him happy when he looks at it, it's something that makes him smile.     What would you make of this? Do I just make a move on him, since he SEEMS intrested?? Do I wait for him to just do something, I mean...maybe he doesn' t like me ln that way...but I dont think guys just do that for no reason.

20090131161421AAjBqrU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over first boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I broke up ten days ago and I'm not over him. He's in three of my classes at school and we share a lot of the same friends. I was new to our school last year and he was my first friend and I (stupidly) spent most of my time with him... so now I don't have a lot of people to turn to.      I spent the first week begging him to take me back which, looking back, was stupid and just made him more angry. I'm starting to accept it although I still want him back.      it's hard seeing him everyday in class... I don't have a lot of friends and he does. It's hard being invisible to him. I really miss him.      Any advice on how to speed up the healing process?

20090131155221AAZTyfZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me with my boyfriend situation....?	Well, we've been dating for a year and 4 months. The first year was absolutely amazing! Never once did we argue. But these past 4 months have been horrible... We're getting mad at each other over small things. He always told me that he wanted me forever.       I'm his first girlfriend, although we're in 11th grade. He's said things to me like, I can't wait to have a future with you and he's even made house plans for us. But that's not the problem. I do not mind ANY of this. I absolutely LOVE this guy. I am a very committed person, anyways.           The problem is, lately he's been acting like he hates me and doesn't want to be around me. So Thursday I made a terrible mistake and broke up with him, only to have him apologize the same day. On the phone Thursday night we were taking and he told me how he really felt. I sort of tricked him into telling me that for the past couple of months that he's been lying to me when he says I love you. He says he only wants me to be happy. He also said that he doesn't see the "spark" in our relationship anymore.            What the hell?? Can guys seriously change their opinion about girls in a matter of days? I still love him and now he's saying that he really does still love me and all this mess.          What the heck am I supposed to do?       If I break up with him, my life will seriously be changed. But I feel like he still doesn't have the same feelings for me as he did. But I really do need help. What do I do? What do you think HE is feeling? He said he would never break up with me unless I was cheating on him or did something extremely stupid. He will never tell me his feelings or whats wrong.          Our main problem: communication. Is their anyway to resolve this?? But anyways I really do need your help, this is causing me physical pain (no lie) I'm getting headaches and stomach pains everytime I think or hear him, because I'm terribly afraid of a broken heart. Nothing is the same anymore...

20090131153959AAyJK0x	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend just told me something that really hurt my feelings...?	Well, for about 3 years I have been best friends with this girl, who I'll (for these purposes) call Jane. So me and jane have been SUCH good friends all these years. We both like different things, but that was what made us so special. Now, we came to high school. Everything was cool until she met this girl named Kate. In math class, they sit next to each other and are always talking. Turns out, they both like the same things. They both like the same musicals, music, and have the same personalities. For a while, they kept hanging out together, and I was totally ok, because kate is one of my good friends as well. But now, something went wrong.      Yesterday, Jane came on to facebook and started a chat. Something was wrong with me, and she asked what it was. I didn't tell her, because as I explained to her, I didn't figure everything out yet. She got mad, and said some really rude things. She said that I just wanted attention, and that I was a liar and I didn't trust her. I explained again what I had said, and I told her she was my BFF, I of COURSE trusted her!   But she told me something that really hurt my feelings. She said that she didn't think we should be BFF's anymore. She said that over the years I changed, and that she changed too, and she liked the changes she made. She said the new her didn't feel close to me and didn't think she ever would again.   I was SO upset. I started crying, and I told her that I tried to talk to her but she was always with Kate. She told me that she was distancing herself because I was changed.   The only difference in my personality is that now i'm less shy and more outspoken. THAT'S IT! Now, she barely says a word to me.      I don't know what to do. I can't stand losing my best friend when I don't even know why! She seems to be happy without me but i'm still really hurt. What do I do?

20090131154313AA0hd52	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if he likes me or is frontin?	I just seen the guy I like today and here's what he said. When I walked in my sister told him "Hey" and he said "Wuz up". (He had is phone with him the whole time; just listening to the ringtones while still looking down) When I told him hey, he just looked at me and said "I'm not even cool witch you" (clowning). After a while when were outside in the yard he started doing all these crazy things like trippin over clogs of dirt and dancin. Then he did something crazy and I asked him what he did, he "Nothin"; all sweet and soft. When were getting ready to leave me and my sister told everyone out there bye and she had to go and hug him. I didn't hug him because I didn't want to just come all out with it because it was me, my sister, my friend Joe, and my two cousins. (We are all around the ages of 15-19) Anyway, he just kept looking down at his phone. I'm sorry this is so long but I just need to know if he likes me and if he is just shy or frontin. My reasons for why he didn't hug me was because of the people that were around him. That's what I think.

But i forgot to answer him before the end of the day. so i couldn't talk to him for 2-3 weeks.       But then my other friend Shawn asked me out that saturday and i told him yes because i liked him too. we were together from 12/21-1/15.we broke up because he didn't like me that way anymore and cause he never really stood up for me when his friends kept bugging me. i was okay with breaking up because i kept thinking about Jake. so about a week later Jake asks if i'd still consider going out with him and of course i said yes cause i liked him way more than Shawn.       Jake and i are still going out  and we're extremely happy together.   Shawn and i are still friends but a few days ago he starts asking me questions about jake and i and why i dont  have him on my top friends.      after he asked his questions and i answered i told him to answer mine truthfully. my question "why do you care who is and isn't on my top"   and after a while he answers " i only asked because i don't know  i guess i started liking you when i saw how happy you are with Jake"   so then the next day we were all hanging out Jannet,Jake, me Shawn, and Abby(shawns ex b4 me but they're best friends) Jake and i were all lovey dovey and Shawn was flirting with  Abby. when i got home i was messaging my friend Jannet and she said that she saw shawn looking at me the whole time and i was like no he was flirting with abby. he asked out abby later that night and she said yes. he still likes me but kinda likes abby. i'm starting to have feelings for him again but i still love Jake.

We have been living together for one year. I am 20 and he is 21. It seems like he is going to (propose) but I can't tell. My grandma told me last year that he said that the small ring he gave me was an engagement ring but I didn't know it yet. Now yesterday we went and picked out a bigger ring. His family seems to be asking are we getting married and his dad is always talking about how much he loves and cares about me. I my friends think that he is going to do it. The ring that we picked out is hiding in the room somewhere and when we picked it out he said, "you know what your present is but you won't know when your going to get it."

A few days ago I told the guy I was dating that it isn't going to work out because I don't think he's into me because his actions don't show it.  I miss him so much though. Before we began dating, we talked or texted  everyday for 2 years!     Anyway,, I had my breakdown moment this afternoon . I called him. His VM picked up and I left a short message that said.... "I miss your voice and had to call you to hear it.  I hope you are doing well and I hope you have fun tomorrow night."    I wonder if he liked that message or if he wishes I would just go away?
20090131175810AARoRtq	Family & Relationships;Family	My loving mother has some new, unloving opinions?	My mother is perhaps the most loving, understanding, caring person I've ever known in my entire life.  She has been my rock, she has seen me through many rough times in my life, and I don't know what I would've done without her.  She remains to this day to be my best friend.   However, for the last few years, right after she hit menopause, she is irritable and jumpy 70% of the time I spend with her.  She spends much of her time complaining about her house, my father, and her own health problems.  But she's my mother, I love her, and I look past her negative aspects.   However, yesterday, she said something that just made me cringe, and I feel like it completely changes how I see her.  My brother's girlfriend "Joyce" was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, and there is a good chance that it may kill her, or cause her to have a massive stroke.  She's only 27, my brother is 28.  And my mother is going to try and talk my brother into breaking up with her and forcing her to move out of his house because "he's too young to deal with something like that."  They've been together for 3 years, live together, and seem very much in love.   I feel very bad for "Joyce", and I really feel for my brother, and I'm speechless when it comes to how my mother feels about all this.     Should I tell my mother to mind her own business?   And, instead of wanting to "be there" for my brother and Joyce, she wants to break them up and doesn't seem to care what what happens to Joyce one way or the other.  I can't wrap my mind about such carelessness from such a loving person.  Can someone maybe explain this to me?

20090131181750AASp5Sv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know whether I want a girlfriend?	Hi, I'm 17 and single, my mates all want girlfriends and are feeling lonely they haven't got one. I am not feeling depressed I haven't got a girl. Mu mates say I should start looking at normal 17 year olds want a girlfriend. I say I'm just waiting for the right girl. I have friends who are girls and I intend on keeping them as friends but my mates say I should take it to the next level. Who is right? I am asking because it seems most 17 year olds have girlfriends or want one. I don't want a girlfriend just for the sake of having one, or to try and impress other people.

My parents want me to go to this church where there are like 200 teens that are like 16-19 years old. The kids there are stuck up. I am not social. I hate Church but I love god. Church always leads to complete and utter humiliation. That is why I hate church. I my two friends could go I would be ok. But my mom thinks that my friends are rude. I don't care. My parents are sooo...cheezy! They don't understand me at all! When ever I go to churches people stare at me like I AM SOME DISGRACE TO THE WORLD....I am just a norm teen. It always seems like my peers look down on me. Like I am stupid.          Will just sitting in the chair (they have like a whole floor dedicated to teens) with no emotions at all work? Uhhh...or just like no emotional non existing? Let me remind you I am going with nobody...not a single soul. Not a friend..Boy friend....sibling...cousin.

20090131183742AA1nCsa	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is being rude... help?	My best friend Julie slept over at my house a few days ago.  In the morning, my mom offered to go out and get bagels at Einstein's Bagels for everyone.  Julie said "McDonald's is OK with me, thanks."  My mom later brought this up to me, asking why in the world Julie had said that.      She tends to meddle in my relationship.  A lot.  She will talk to my boyfriend alone and tell him all the things he should be doing with me (holding my hand more often, opening doors for me, etc) and constantly being involved.  But when she finally gets a boyfriend and Thomas (my boyfriend) offers up some advice for her, she flips out, telling him to stop getting involved.  "It's none of your business!" she told him.  I'm offended that she's being so hypocritical...      She's a very slim, short girl whereas I am taller and more "well-developed" than she.  She will often mention my weight or stature and make some neutral comment on it.  Never rude, never objectionable, but still a bit obnoxious at times.      Whenever we have plans and my parents are driving me over to meet her, she calls me.  A ton.  My family has never been very punctual so we're almost always about 10 minutes late.  I tell her I'll be there at 1:30, she'll call me at 1:35, wondering where I am.  Can you say, annoying!?!      OK, sorry for the ranting.  Do you have any advice on how to deal with any of these issues?  Should I tell her that she is being rude?  In the past when I have tried this, she doesn't really respond.  She gets a rather large ego at any one compliment so when I say something, anything, negative about her, she tends to get rather hostile.  Thanks a ton everyone!!

I really like him, but he goes to a different high school and I don't get to see him very often. I really miss him. He's funny and sweet and when I'm with him, it's like nothing needs to be said, we just feel really comfortable with each other. Lately though, we haven't been able to talk with each other on the phone because of how busy we are with homework and his phone didn't work. There's a guy in my algebra class who talks with me sometimes. He's hilarious and really nice, lately, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this new guy and I have no idea why!!! Does thinking so much about this new guy make me a horrible girlfriend? I feel so guilty for thinking about this new guy who might not even be the least interested in me, when I know that my boyfriend cares alot about me. Am I a bad girlfriend?

Chick im talking to now, I met while walking to the bus heading to campus.   When i go to bars, its like these girls dont want to meet guys (or just me, and all the other guys i see at the bars).      So girls, do you seriously go to bars just to use guys in buying drinks? Or do you actually want good conversation, and maybe a nightcap?   Im not frustrated, i just dont like going to bars. And if i learn that "youre not going to find that special someone at a bar" then i'll stop going since im forcing myself to go.(Well my friends are forcing me to go)

Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to.

We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.

We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np.

But the other girls were all over him all night too. Then he told me later that night he really liked me and doesnt want me to worry bout anything.

20090131181817AA60C96	Family & Relationships;Family	Moms and dads please help why would a dad have to go through?	Why would a Dedicated Dad have to go through this three different times in life, fighting for rights to my kids from three different women. Something I'm not proud of but I have 4 kids from three different women who each one has had a relationship with me for at least 7 years or more. The reason each one ended is really besides the point , but to make it as short as possible, each one left me for another man because I worked to hard to raise my family { good reason to leave ha } Maybe so since I was to busy working because I was the sole financial supporter of the household. Anyway the point -- each time one left I had to fight for as much time as I could get with my kids, Two I ended up with custody, because the mom was trying to keep them away and making up aweful things in court to keep me away,{ but were all proven lies } My last one who's 3 now, her mom tells her daddys mean, { when she knows I wouldn't hurt a soul in the world } She pays a babysitter out of my childsupport money, when she has been informed by an attorney 3 times that i,m available to have my daughter. The reason she does this is because I already have my daughter 3 days one week and 5 the next and she's afraid if I have her more i will ask to have my childsupport reduced. What a selfish way to be. Why would you make a little girl go to a babysitter when a loving dedicated dad wants her.   The big question---- why have all the women in my life have to have thier power trips over kids and not shaere them like mom and dad are still together. Any input on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance   Terry

I have finished with someone who isn't good for me, and I have replaced him with stuffing my face constantly.   He is controlling, and stubborn, and makes me happy when we are together, but is withholding, and I don't trust him..   He is still calling every other day, and wants to meet, and get back together..   Another guy likes me, but it's not passionate.   Is it better to be with someone you are really into chemistry wise where it doesn't work in the real world, or to be in the real world, compulsively eating too much to fill the void..?
20090131174242AAsrlRd	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I let go of all feelings for my father?	I hate him, he really couldn't be a worse parent, well if he hit me it would be worse but then I would be able to have him removed from my life. Anyways, I am ashamed to be related to a person like him. All I have wanted for the past 4 years was to have a normal family and a normal house. I now see that this is now out of the question and I need to move on with my life and leave them behind me (my mom and brother too). I hate him but the problems with hating him is that it hurts me worse then it will ever hurt him. It will only keep me a victim in this situation, as long as their actions influence my emotions then they are still controlling and hurting me. I don't want to live as a victim anymore. I need to know how to make it so their bad behavior is not going to determine who I am or how I feel. I need to make my own reputation and decide I am not going to be like them, and not going to let them ruin who I am. How do I just stop hating him and cut off all emotions from him?

Then I can't take it anymore so I fight back, then in the end, sometimes, she gets all in my face, so I back away, she comes in closer and pushes me, then I push her back, she shoves me, I slap her, she punches my nose, and things get pretty physical. Is this normal? I keep asking my parents for help, once I was even on the ground, my face bleeding because she scratched me so much on the face. My legs were aching and I couldn't get up. Then my parents got into the doorway of their room, looked down at me, and closed the door. Sometimes they say things like "This s for the two of you to solve!" or "Can you two just shut up for once?!" I said I was going to call the police once, and she knocked me unconscious. I'm scared. What do I do? Is this normal? Please help me before... bad things happen, I don't know what to say anymore! Help me! What should I do?

Is this normal? I keep asking my parents for help, once I was even on the ground, my face bleeding because she scratched me so much on the face. My legs were aching and I couldn't get up. Then my parents got into the doorway of their room, looked down at me, and closed the door. Sometimes they say things like "This s for the two of you to solve!" or "Can you two just shut up for once?!" I said I was going to call the police once, and she knocked me unconscious. I'm scared. What do I do? Is this normal? Please help me before... bad things happen, I don't know what to say anymore! Help me! What should I do? I feel bad hurting her, I don't want to fight, but she seems to enjoy it! She's sick! She laughs when I cry. Help...

20090131183355AA7zzra	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've been going out with this girl for about a year now, but im joining the army so......?	Ive been seeing this girl for about a year now and i love her death, but in a couple of months i am leaving to the military and she is going to a cal state college.for me being in the military i only get 30 vacation days a year, i dont think its right for me to hold her back cuz i will hardly see her and it would be a really hard long distance relationship and she would probably be better off with somebody closer to her or someone that goes to her college. so when the time comes for me to leave do u think i should break up with her or should i give it try and see if the long distance relationship could work.

20090131164615AAiA3ye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have trust issues with my friend after she got with my ex...how do I overcome them?	Okay well I was dating a guy for 2 years and 8 months then in July of 08 he dumped me, and I found 2 days later he was with and having sex with my friend. I didn't end any friendship with him or her because I would rather have a friendship with them then nothing at all. I moved on to a guy named Marcus who I have absouletely no trust issues with at all, he's proven to me he loves me and I'm the only one for him. My ex doesn't want much to do with my friend anymore, they are still together but he wont talk to her unless hes forced to so now she talks to my bf more and has given him a nickname "bon bon" (which is candy i guess), and she even wants to throw him a birthday party. I want to believe her motive is she just want to be good friends with him but something inside of me hates it. How do I overcome this?
20090131180455AAEdcox	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you choose the nice guy?	I've dated the jerks and have been abused, cheated on, and left broken. Each time I start to get involved with a nice guy who wouldn't do any of those things, a jerk comes around, says those nice things, and I'm hooked. Truth is, it's hard for me to be attracted to the nice guys because I guess I want that "macho" guy, but my idea of a "perfect" relatinoship calls for someone who will make me feel like I'm on top of the world, not for the first month, but for the entire relationship. With that said, would it be worth it to be with a guy that would treat you perfectly even if you weren't necessarily as attracted to him as you would be a more macho guy that would treat you good for the first month then treat you like property?         I asked this already and got some good answers, wanted to see if I could get more :).  Thank you so much!

20090131171550AAFEubG	Family & Relationships;Family	Seriously depressed, can anyone help with this family issue?	I need advice, Or someone to at least ease my mind! We have three boys, 4, 3, and 1.  My husbands sister has a baby thats 1.       my sister in laws husband is a lazy piece of horse S**t! He will not take care of his son, he doenst work, he sits at home all day while my mother in law watches his kid. I am beyond sick of it!       My mother in law never see's out three kids anymore because she always has his kid while hes busy sleeping or whatever. She doesnt even aknowledge our kids anymore! Its been like this for the past year {since our nephew was born!} Every night and day she has that kid. Its killing my oldest son the most because he used to spend a lot of time with grandma,but now hw never gets time with her, and if he does go over there, our nephew is there, so our son doesnt get the attention he starvs from her!      We have tried numerous times to talk to her about this situation and how we feel like our kids are ignored and deprived from her attention. But she gets pissed off and denies it and sticks up for the piece of crap that sleeps all day and cant take care of his kid.      Can anyone give me some advice? would I be a complete a** if I stopped contact with her, hoping that maybe if she hasnt heard about her grandkids or from them that maybe she will want to see them?

20090131174031AACpoQt	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do if you were in an abusive family?	What would you do in this situation? If an adult family member finally had the courage one day to come forward with experiences of childhood abuse, and instead of real support, they get continued criticism of the person's passive personality, their whole family obviously conspiring against that person making them feel guilty, and even pushing in unison with the intention or hope that they would do something drastic like suicide, or become violent, or become severely depressed and isolated from the family. It's as if the family keeps some sort of inner circle and try to push out those not like them. I mean, my expectations for the person's family would be they would immediately help that person confront the abuser, or at the very least understand that person more and help that person be happy. I fear that my friend's abuse was even planned. I get so angry sometimes, seeing what my friend is going through, that I want to post the names of his family somewhere...

20090131165754AAUEpam	Family & Relationships;Family	A family loss and people are mad at me...help?	I am not an emotional person. The only time someone sees me cry is if I was laughing so hard that tears came to my eyes or if I get hurt really bad.      Very recently, my grandmother died of ovarian cancer. Everyone is crying and stuff, but me. I miss her and I loved her very much, but we weren't very close, I saw her on birthdays and holidays, but that's it. My mom got mad at me because I don't seem devastated or depressed. Is this a bad thing for me, or is my mom just shaken because of the loss of her mom?      Any advice helps. Thanks.

20090131173625AA4GjNK	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I get my nose pierced ?	my mom is leaving to Africa tomorrow and will come back in June 10. I plan on getting my nose pierced and I am 18. I've asked her opinion, not her permission about it and she said no. I told her that I am 18 and I don't need her approval. Girls at school got her belly, nose pierced and they're only 15. I am 18 and she doesn't want me to have one, Too bad. She said that christians don't do piercings. I would still be a christian no matter what. It wouldn't change my religion. She's so annoying. I'm thinking after high school graduation I want to move out but I don't have enough money for that. She used to spank me for something simple. I will get my nose pierced with my money. she should be glad that I don't do drugs, my grades are good and I don't have a boyfriend (I want to wait). Girls under 18 at my school smoke, have sex with different people, skip school and give their parents attitude. I don't do any of these, yet she won't let me do what I want. When she comes back, I know she will be shocked but it's my life. Having piercings and tattoos mean prostitute in african culture. That's why she doesn't want me to have one, too bad I will get one anyway. I am a good girl, I always do chores at home and I respect people. my mom thinks that I want to follow people, but it's not true. I've been wanting to have one when I was 11 and I've asked her about it and she said wait until you get older. Now I'm 18 and she still say no. I can't take it anymore. I don't really get along with her, she always criticize me. I'm glad she is leaving tomorrow

I love my partner very much, but absolutely dread it when his eleven year old daughter comes to stay. She is intellegent and likes to make sure everyone knows it. She constantly puts anyone down if they make any kind of mistake, and my 15 year old son and I feel very inferior around her.She is rude and arrogant, self centred and seems to have a very over flated ego.   Dad thinks the sun shines out of her, and ignores her behaviour. I have mentioned it so many times, but he wont ever say anything.   I am close to finishing with him over this, as I am fed up with feeling put down all the time.

20090131183455AAAJyjN	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do, when should I do it?	Wow I am really going to throw it out there and tell the whole story. 3months before I was born my father was in a motorcycle accident and became paraplegic. I was born to a 17 year old woman (mom duh) and a 19 year old man (dad). They tried to stay together after the accident they managed another 2 years but dad was verbally abusive and it was a bad situation all around, which everyone can understand, at 19 dad was not able to "deal" with being confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. So I grow up going back and forth between them. everything is as "normal" as they could make it, again I am sure many of you have divorced parents and understand what this is like. when I am 15 tragedy strikes my dad again. while in the hospital a person training to be a physical therapist breaks his hip while extending his leg for physical therapy, lawsuits are filed but as you may know its hard to sue the hospital and get real doctors to go against the hospital so he gets nothing. Big deal he is already paralyzed right, well he can't transfer to the wheelchair anymore, he is unwilling to try to learn a new method of how to get in his chair and to maintain his independence, he moves back in with his mother and brother ( my uncle the alcoholic). So the story continues, I get married move to Florida, get divorced, start a business with a friend selling mattresses and I am doing well in Florida dodging hurricanes when I get this call: Dad says my grandmother (Nanny Sue) fell in the hall and broke her hip, now she is bedridden/bedbound/bedfast ( still don't know which I prefer to call it) like my dad. I feel terrible, conflicted in my faith and what is right, my mother is telling me “he made his own bed now he can lie in it etc“. I decide to become a man (at 36) but not really cause I still play 4-6 hours of video games a day. I move to Tennessee and move in with Nanny Sue, Dad and the drunk Uncle, in a house purchased by my Nanny Sue’s sister, who died shortly after with the will saying that the house reverts back to the aunt’s estate once Nanny Sue and Dad don’t live there anymore. Now I take care of all them 24 hours a day 7 days a week (funny cause so many people look at me like I don’t have job, including me). I don't take money from them except to pay for groceries and I make the uncle pay me $150 dollars a month cause I am taking care of him too and he has never had to pay rent before. That was 3 years ago. I am now going crazy, Dad drives me nuts Uncle drives me nuts, nanny Sue is still sweet but... she raised them so she made them the spoiled brats that they are. She defends them and I end up with no “power” in the situation like a some domestic servant or worse I get treated as if I should be more like their Mom used to be/do. I am not her I am not here to take care of them, I just want to take care of her because she took care of my father, none of them want to go to a retirement home, dad is still just 68 and Nanny Sue wants to keep everyone together, I just play more PS3 and ignore it, How long can they all keep living, when they are killing me? When should I do something else? What else should I do?

I don't get "crushes" like normal high school senior girls do. I fall for a guy and then I basically fall in love with him and it never works out...at least that's what happened last time with another guy and i just couldn't seem to get over him. ANYWAYS. I really like this guy and him and I are working on this huge project together at church so we'll be having to see a lot of each other for the next month. But I don't want to seem clingy and trying to get his attention and stuff. But I don't want to seem like I don't want him around and avoid him either. And I just really want to ge close to him. What should I do?!?!?! I really like him...like I'm on the verge of heartbreak. And yes I know, I'm only in high school. But you can have strong feelings like this in high school. Trust me. Haha! So...what should I do?

20090131164218AAhOpWQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So sick of being single!!?	I'm 20 and have been single for about a year and a half. I was in a long-term relationship for 2 years but then we split up and I just can't meet anyone else! I don't want to meet a drunk guy in a club but I'm not sure how else to meet someone! I reckon I'm a nice girl, I've got a good sense of humour and and perfectly friendly, but I'm not sure I'm that pretty. I get told I'm pretty but I'm a bit overweight. Do I really have to lose weight to find a boyfriend? Is the world that shallow?    I'm 20 now and everyone seems to be pairing off. I'm terrified of being left single forever and dying alone and unhappy. I'm not the kind of person who can enjoy being single, I prefer to be in a relationship and I flourish with someone to care about. How can I find a nice boyfriend who I can have a nice time with and who I can care for?

20090131180900AAvN4Xx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am pretty, but why I am so lonely?	I am a college girl. Many people told me that I am pretty, hot, beautiful, smart, nice and friendly. I am outgoing too. But why I am so lonely. I have many friends, but they are just so superficial, they seem nice to me, but when I ask them to hang out, they usually say they r busy or sth. I have never got a bf b4. my life is so dry. Sometimes I am wondering is it beacause I am an asian girl, so people stereotype me as a mute, or nerd or sth. or because I have accent. I mean I speak english well but have accent. I'd appreciate it if u guys could give me some advice.

20090131171259AAq3WD9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this verbal/emotional abuse?  Does it sound like he's hurting my feelings on purpose?	I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now.  Everything used to be great!  He never called me a bad thing, EVER.  He always said I was perfect for him, and that he loved me more then anything else.  (Of course, this was the Honeymoon Phase).   Soon after, we began fighting more and more.   Then, it got better, and now we don't fight AS much as we used to, although when we do they are horrible.   He always seems to bring up things that I've done wrong in order to make me feel bad and apologize again for those things.  Lately, however, not only is he bringing up these things in fights, but also when we're just having a normal conversation!      Also, "teasingly" he calls me things like *****, Whore, ****, Hoe, Stupid, Retarded, Smart-***, things like that.  And it really hurts my feelings when he says things like this to me, concidering I never even "joke" with him about things like that.   Also, he jokes with me about how he should "Upgrade" and find someone better.  Even though I THINK he's joking, it still hurts me a whole lot, and somewhere deep down, I'm not really sure if I should believe that this is just joking.   But I really love him, and I don't want to have to leave him.  I've said if he didn't change, I don't know how much longer I was going to stay with him...was that the wrong thing to do?   I'm really sick and tired of him hurting my feelings, especially if I've had a good day.   I'm really not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for, but I would really lilke some insight on this problem.   Thanks in advanced!
20090131170256AARbKGx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she might still be interested after all this time?	OK this is a long story. I knew a girl in high school, that I dated for about 1 week, but due to a personal crisis of hers it ended (we didn't exactly break up).      Anyways she has messaged me a few times over the last 4 years or so, and has mentioned that she had been thinking about me and our brief dating. I never took it any further as I was living in another city, or I had a girlfriend at the time.      Now by coincidence we are going to the same college and have a class together. She passed me the other day and gave me a very friendly smile and hello.      She is a really sweet girl and I think the circumstances might be good that I am interested in asking her out again, but I'm concerned that she might not be interested anymore as it has been a long time and I have changed considerably, for example gaining weight :-/.      What do you think? The impression that I got from the way she greeted me was that she was happy to see me, and since she contacted me several times over the years I think it could be possible that she might be interested in going out again.      What do you think?

20090131183831AAtc3Uw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can You Hate Your "Best Friend"?	We've known eachother awhile, but when we first met, I was her only friend and she was my only friend. In the past few years, I've made a lot of new friends, but she really hasn't. I introduced all my new friends to her and never leave her out in plans, but she'd say things to me such as "You like them so much better than me" or "Why are you always ignoring me? You are!" She's really clingy and I've tried to see her side of everything, but it's so frustrating. Recently, two of our mutual friends told me that she told them she was depressed because I didn't care about her. That hurt me so much because I've literally given the past ten years of my life for her. I don't know what to do now. I can't call her out on anything, or her parents will get involved. I'm just stuck, and I'm so upset and frustrated. Is this right for me to feel this way? What should I do? Please help!

Our sex life is amazing, but i stopped the sex for now is that good? as the imagine of him inside someone else makes me sick to my stomach.I cant look at him with out crying and thinking of how he hurt me.He still treats me like im the only thing that matters to him, but right now i couldn't care.I grew up in foster care and now i feel i have nothing..again. My best friends are in NY where im from and i go to them when i can just to get away from it all. I was thinking of a divorce but maybe i should think about all this a little more. I wish i could make him feel the pain i am in. Should i end it or just stay & see how it goes?

20090131180459AAG99Zz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I felt very embarrassed! He made out with me when i less expected it! =/?	Me and my boyfriend have been going out for a week now. He's 16 and I'm 15. We hung out last night. We usually just kiss. He made out with me last night though. I really did not expect it and i basically freaked out. It was my first time actually making out with a guy. It wasn't such a great experience, i mean freaking out in the middle of making out and like not knowing what to do anymore. :S We kind of talked about it later. I told him he really caught me off guard, which is pretty much why it didn't go so well. I'll probably see him soon again, but i'm not sure how i'll react. He told me he didn't want to make out if i didn't want to. But i actually do. I just don't want to freak out again. What should i do next time, or what should i tell him?

(Chris and Drake are best friends) But one day we (Drake and I) were walking down the hall next to each other talking about random stuff when all the sudden Chris walks up next to me and says "He (Drake) likes you." Drake turned a light shade of pink and turned his face away. I didn't say anything, and walked ahead of them, so I couldn't hear them.        Then the next day i was walking back from class towards my locker when Chris comes up next to me and starts telling me about how Drake always talks about me when i'm not around, after hearing that i didn't want to talk to Chris anymore that day, i walked as fast as i could to get away from him... i mean i'll admit i kinda like Drake, but it's not like i want to date him or anything. So, it dosen't seem to bother Drake that i know he likes me, but i'm afraid that he will feel hurt because i don't like him as much as he seems to like me.   so if anybody is still reading this....do you think he's hurt and covering it up?

20090131172810AASTBYZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has your mother help you in life?	This is about my mother and her influence in my life.I already posted the bottom on yahoo and got some good feedback so I decided to add more lines to it. I am hoping that at the end, I will write enough paragraph for a college essay.What do you think? Once again, feel free to share your own philosophy of life or correct any mistake in mine            “She built a kingdom of knowledge with a third grade education. She has more wisdom than the intellectuals who claimed to be philosophers. Her voice could turn the stubborn to the right direction, her hands could feed the world. When injustice and impunity filled my heart with anger, disgust and resentment, it was in her arms that I discovered the power of forgiveness. She is not a divine creature, thus there is no way that she could suddenly change the negative feelings that I carried in my heart. However, I was to liberate myself till I let my heart ill from within. I realized and understood that A young heart must liberate itself from the dark relic of its past in order for it to reach the dream that it has always fought for. Regrets can only hold it in a backward abysmal and make it bitter. Sadly, a heart that is rotten by bitterness can become a dark nest where hate likes to grow. I should not hate my imperfections because hate makes one blind and obstructs their judgment. It is hard to forget past mistakes and to forgive those who has hurt me but instead of moaning on what has been done I ask God for the courage to accept the things that I cannot change and the wisdom to accept what I cannot change

Yesterday, we had beanie weanie soup and I couldn't get the image of the toilet out of my head as I was fishing around for the weanies in the soup. Should I break up with him?

He wants to go and travel the world, while he's young.    But I want to finish my degree, get a good job and make a decent wage.    I wont finish my degree for another 2years and he has said he doesn't want to wait that long..   a gap year for me is not an option. I want to finish as soon as possible. but neither is splitting up an option!!!      He is soon to have a fair amount of money in his pocket    (because he is about to hit 21 so he'll get money)    this enables him to do what he wants...      My question is, what do I do!!    he wants me to go and see the world with him,    but I am in uni, happy at home and yet to receive my fortune until later this year, so I couldnt even afford it yet...      Do I say: go.. enjoy your life, dont let me hold you back..    or do I say: dont leave, and risk him resenting me for "stopping" him..      as regards time he would be away, we're looking a good year for him to travel around.. I cant remember where he said, but I no he wants to finish in america.

Ages ago he was showing me photos, and from that I saw that there were of pornographic photos of his ex-girlfriend mixed in. He thought I only saw one, and didn't realise I knew there were more there. It didn't bother me too much as it was from his past and his albums were in such a mess it appeared just an oversight. However after returning back home from work travels, I found that he had created an album of them. The thing that got me was that they were not just porno pics, but also various portrait ones and even one of her hand with a ring on her finger! I confronted me about it and he said he was just trying to organise his albums and the delete them. Except that he forgot to delete them. I think thats bullshit. What does this mean and am I right to be crazy mad?

20090131173937AAt7W9u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ez quick 10 points, just need a legitiment advice?	During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was - but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain - upon the bleak walls - upon the vacant eye-like windows - upon a few rank sedges - and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees - with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opium - the bitter lapse into everyday life - the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart - an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it - I paused to think - what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher! It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unrufled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down - but with a shudder even more thrilling than before - upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.       Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country - a letter from him - which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness - of a mental disorder which oppressed him - and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said - it was the apparent heart that went with his request - which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.       Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other - it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the 'House of Usher' - an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.       I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment - that of looking dow

I like him very much, but I may have mistakenly and innocently jeopardized his job -- and mine (I brought to light some things new management should never had known about, but did not do so because I wanted to be malicious or hurt anyone). He seems to feel that I should have known better and that if anyone should be cut, it should be me. He's very scared of being cut.      I can't get him to talk to me alone because he looks afraid of me, yet I feel he still has some feelings toward me. I see that he talks to or emails his former ex-girlfriend or ex-wife, and I feel so helpless and lonely. On the weekends, I think he must be with her, and I wish it were me.      I don't know why he doesn't see how much I care for him. I just want to be with him, but need to support myself and pay my bills too.      Maybe I'm nuts for liking a guy who won't support me, but I do, and very much.   -----------------------   What I spoke to new management about was job-related. It involved my role and the work flow. The man I liked was part of a group to set a different scene to new management, and I, by mistake, crippled this effort. Now both are jobs are at risk due to my innocence (and stupidity).
20090131174229AAycqWg	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel like such a bad brother?	my little brother's gf has moved in with us. I've secretly started to like her, I want to pound her so much all the time. When I see her laying on the couch or walking upstairs and she's beautiful. I feel kinda jealous of my brother. Especially when I know that they are sneaking off getting intimate in their room. He's 21, she's 20. I feel bad but at the same time I want her. I've been trying to talk more to her and get closer when my brother is off to work and it's just us in the house. I don't know what to do? I'm afraid of doing something stupid, I've already made a sexual remark to her but she laughed a little because I made it like a joke but I was secretly being serious. My brother heard it and told me it wasn't cool. we're all about the same age except I'm 2 years older. Yesterday evening, it was both our days off from work so me and her were watching a film on the couch (not cuddled or touching or anything) and my brother came home from work an hour later and saw us and I could tell he got pissed, he hardly talked to me. So I went to my room. I feel bad but I can't help myself. I'm starting to think about her a lot throughout the day and I even have had sexual fantasies about her. I need help.

20090131181429AAKpAv4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Are your parents as annoying as mines?	My mom and dad are always saying stuff to put me down. Always comparing me to other kids. Saying I will be a failure in the future and how I will drop out of school. They are always putting me on the spot and saying things to make me feel bad. They will criticize everything I do, even how I hold my spoon while eating to anything I do. My mom goes through my personal stuff. Walks into the room whenever she wants. When I have my wallet on my desk, she looks through things in there. They won't let me go out of the house late or hang out with my friends most of the time. I am 20 years old and in college my third year. My mom asks questions all the time. When I have class, if I bought my books, when I'm going to be home. Even when I answered a few times before. Are your parents more annoying?

20090131184000AAwsYS9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Heartbroken but still in love. what do I do?	On Thursday afternoon my boyfriend broke up with me because he doesnt feel the same way. I still love him soooo sooo sooooo much and havnt stopped crying. Hes perfect for me in everyway and i cant see myself ever moving on at this point. He still wants to be friends but i want SO much more. The thing is I would rather be friends (even though I get a lurching/sinking feeling in my stomach everytime i think of this prospect) than for him to leave my life all together. He is such a great guy and he feels aweful and is really sorry. I dont resent him at all. Please dont try to tell me that hes not good enough for me or any of that because hes perfect. I need him back. I dont know what to do. I spoke to him on the phone last night and he explained that he 'loves me but isnt inlove with me' and that he 'wants things to go back to normal but he cant help it'. WHAT DO I DO? i dont want to lose him :( :( :( I have never been this sad. please help me.

20090131185333AAiBqYD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I orgasm for my girlfriend?	I'm able to masturbate to orgasm without a problem, but whenever we start getting rowdy, I can't seem to orgasm for her. The first time we made out (which included some groping, but no under the clothes stuff or anything big) I actually came, but the next time I couldn't even get hard for her when she was giving me a handjob, and since then I've been able to get it up for her pretty easily, but I can't seem to finish. She's tried handjobs and blowjobs and although I can feel myself getting close (as in, I could finish myself off at that point) she can't get me over the edge. It's really annoying because she thinks it's her fault even though I tell her it's not. I know this is probably all mental and just kind of a block in my brain that prevents me from just letting go, but it's really putting a strain on the physical part of our relationship. We're not having sex yet, so we're limited as to what we can do. The annoying part is she won't let me finish myself off if she gets me all the way there, because she wants to make it happen and gets offended if I try. She also doesn't like it when it looks like I'm making myself try too hard to finish. I've heard that you shouldn't go into it with any expectations and be fine with not finishing, but I'm kind of embarrassed because I've never heard of this happening to guys and my friends are able to come just fine with their girls. Can someone please help? I just want to give her what she wants.

20090131192511AAi9b4j	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it wrong for me to be feeling the way I'm feeling?	Okay, my best friend is boy, and so you know I am a girl. He has been getting more social and is friends with a totally different crowd than me. I really miss him, I haven't been able to really see him in the last couple of months because I am the lead in the city play and practice is crazy, and that's not even mentioning all the school clubs I am in. Well I just finished my play today, and I headed over to his house to see if he wanted to do something but he said he was busy downloading movies for his friends. Now when he downloads movies for us he just clicks the button then we go to the mall for a while. I am super afraid we aren't going to be friends much longer, and that kills me. I mean I like him better than all my girl friends here ( meaning girls who are friends for you idiots out there) So is it wrong for me to feel this way? What should I do? And remember he is a stupid boy, like all of them lol

I'm 18 and shes 17 if you want age for some reason.

20090131194517AAQeanQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What are true friends and why are they so hard to find?	I have many friends but a handful who i would call close friends.   I am a very loyal friend (many say this of me) and I live by my principles.      However, when I put my full trust in people they often seem to let me down, by being unloyal, selfish and so on when I need them the most. This applies to most close friends I have made throughout my life.      This makes me feel very isolated at times, discouraged and lonely.      Am I expecting too much from my friends?   Does anyone else have this problem?   What are true friends and will I truly ever find one?
20090131193924AAFW8pJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl's what do you think about this? what should i do?	Ok. here is the thing. When i was a freshman, i had gym with like three other classes in the same gym. So, i used to check this girl out in the other class doing aerobics, and she was freaking hot. I used to stare at her, but i was never going to talk to her, am wait too ugly for her. But, one day i saw her name on the schools newspaper lol... and i search for her on myspace, so i added her and started talking to her. " I didnt have a picture on my myspace". Anyways, i told her i sorda stalk her but it was because i though she was kind of cute, and she said it was ok and didnt felt bother by that. Anyways, we talked on myspace for a while then we moved to msn, and we chatted more frequently. Still she didnt know who i was, and i wasn't going to tell her either. SO one day, i log in, and i didn't notice i had set a default pic on msn, with me on it. So am like oh F***. And she is like is that you, and i had to tell her that was me. So then now we still talk on msn messenger but she said she knows who i am already and has seen me at school. I didn't wanted that to happen? am not what you call good looking... am not even looking at all... if you know what i mean. Anyways, what should i do, should i tell her she gots the wrong guy, or should i just let this go on?      Any opinions?
20090131203044AABcFhd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he really a nice guy, or is he just a jerk?	Okay, so I know this guy, and he seems like a really nice guy. He's been flirting with me a lot, and one of my friends decided to go up to him and ask him if he liked me, knowing that I liked him. I heard from this friend, and my other reliable source that he doesn't like me, but they also asked him straight out. He's still really been flirting with me, and not a lot with other girls. He's also has been ignoring me a bit. Does he like me, or is he just being a jerk?

20090131195641AAWB9Hm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's hot, I'm... well, not?	He's my best friend's cousin, and the sweetest person I've ever met. We've become fairly good friends and have fun together, but I'm hoping that someday it might evolve into something else. I care for him dearly, and we have a lot of inside jokes.      The thing is, his entire family is very good-looking and rather petite (he's the tallest in the family at 5'9"), and I'm just pretty average.    I'm taller and larger boned than his relatives and not as delicate or attractive as them.      I know this is shallow, but it worries me a little.    Being surrounded by attractive people and having the looks and talent (he's very musical) to be with any girl he chooses, do you think there's a chance that he might ever think of me as more than a friend?

Should I just try the jerk guy approach? It seems to work pretty well. But I was think of throwing in some charm. Charm is women's kryptonite.       My question is....how do I get her to accept me cheating on her?

I was talking to her again earlier and i was telling her how i have been in the hospital since tuesday. She asked me if i was going back to school or to my parents. When i told her school she asked if i was alone taking care of myself and i should let her know if i needed anything or even just company.

20090131191007AAa6TS5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, what do you think of guys with a "naughty" smile?	I doubt "naughty" smile is the proper term used to describe such a smile, but what I mean is when the guy somewhat bends his lips/mouth in a certain manner and smiles. It makes the guy seem like a bad guy, in a hot and nice way. From what I have seen, it is apparently supposed to drive girls wild and melt their hearts. Hopefully, you get the idea of what I mean and can picture the smile. Tell me what you think of guys that can do a really hot version of such a smile. I would just like to know your opinions. If most girls like it, maybe I can work myself on how to do it. Hahaha. Thank you.
20090131195042AAYAv4W	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do about my family...?	Right now my dad is on a rampage and in a horrible fight with my mom. My dad was asking about why my mom has been acting weird ever since they divorced 4 years ago. ( They live in the same house, they cant afford to live apart, how pathetic) I was fed up of living in fear of him and told him that she is deathly afraid of him. So now he's on a rampage about it.      Be in mind that my dad has an extreme case of Bi Polar disorder and is not on any type of medication. I'm not sure if that makes any difference though....      Well anyways what am I supposed to do?   Do I try to talk to them or do I just leave them alone?      Why can adults be so childish and immature sometimes?      Thanks in advance!
20090131204635AA86jkc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it too early to give flowers?	My MIL and I have had a months long feud. I reconciled with her today, looks like. I feel bad for some of the problems she faces and want to send her some flowers from my son (her grandson) and myself. Flowers are expensive and die, but I thought they would bless her (make her happy).       I don't see her very much and hate cards! Such a waste of paper!      What else can I send her, that has low or NO delivery charge. She might like fruit but I am concerned her husband might eat all of it. Any suggestions? I do not go to her house, and don't wish to due to personal reasons.

20090131214158AAmCs1z	Family & Relationships;Friends	3 best friends troubles!?	Okay so I have 2 best friends, and it always seems that two are closer and one is always left out.  A while ago i was a little bit closer with one of them and the other was jealous, but then i started getting closer with the other one and the other got jealous! Also the two friends have every class together, but I'm not in any of their classes.  So this problem we have is kinda weird we don't ever talk about it I just kinda notice it.  Lately our friendship has been going really well and I am equally friends with both of them.  Anyways, this past week I was sick and on the day I got better and came back my two friends were inseparable, and they seemed kind of annoyed at me.  Sometimes when I would say things I would catch them making eye contact and I can tell they were venting about me all week.  I don't know what to do! I love both these girls but I feel excluded from our little group now!
20090131202521AAQfYkR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I dont know what to do anymore?	I dont know what to do. At home i feel useless (when i get in fights with my sister, my mom says im a ***** and a horrible person, when i get a B or below, i get compared to my younger "gifted program" sister. Whrn i dont eat enough, they call the nutritionist who forces me to eat, when i dont excercise enough, my parents say i have no self motivation)   At school i am falling behind because i can't concentrate; i am focusing on other problems   I recently told a bunch of people i was bi. Surprisingly, ( i am popular and i thought they wouldnt accept me anymore ) everyone was cool with it, but now a couple people said i told people to get attention. I feel like every group of friends i have has there own group with out me. I dont know where i belong.    Whrn i tried to tell a friend how depressed  i feel she thought i was joking. I am not upset at her because i have gotten so good at masking my feeling, but when i am alone everything changes. I will (literally) cry over spilled milk. I lie thinking for hours; losing track of time and missing activities. More than once i have collected all the pills in the house and thought "i could do this. I could end my life right now" but i cant. I am not able to takes those pills. I am too scared      I really dont know how i want people to respond to this. I dont want to hear "you need help. Talk to someone"   I guess i want to know that someone, no matter who or why, just that someone cares.

20090131194401AAoDRoK	Family & Relationships;Friends	My "friend" is so annoying.?	OK. So, She thinks she's so much better than everyone around her. She just starts hating people for no good reason, too.      She's always like "I'm so pretty." "Shut up. I'm way hotter than you." "Ew. She's ugly." "Ugh. That's gross."      She's so judgemental and un-caring. If she's upset, she expects the world to stop what  she/he is doing and turn his/her attention to her. But, when someone else is sad she says, "Oh, they need to get over it."      If she doesn't get what she wants, she gets angry and throws a fit. I hate it.      She demands people to do stuff for her. She does what she wants. Takes what she wants and doesn't give anything back. One time, she took my finished homework and gave me her unfinished work because she"forgot" to do it. She did it without asking also! I got a zero on it. I was puzzled because I knew I did it and then, she omes laughing to me and says, "I stole yours! Haha."      Ughhhhhh.      And she hit me whipped me with a cord when I was laying down. I started crying because it hurt so bad. She started laughing and told me it didn't hurt. Um, yes, it did! Ugh! And she didn't apologize. I want to seriously pun ch her face as HARD AS I CAN.      She thinks she can do whatever she wants.         WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT?      I've told how conceited she is and how mean and un-caring she is because I can't stand it anymore. She says, "I know."
20090131202334AADEb6z	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I mourn my father?	My dad and I have never really had a good relationship. I've tried really hard these last 7 years to have him a part of my and my kids lives, he's a grandpa now. What kid wants to grow up without a grandpa? But he has so many hangups about the past. He's super religious and doesn't accept me cause I'm not married and have kids. I'm a very responsible parent and my boyfriend and I both work hard to give our boys everything they need. I have faith in God and believe Christ teaches unconditional love. So even though my dad and I have said some hurtful things to one another, I always apologize and move on, he can't. We haven't spoken for 6 months, this time because he's been psychological/emotionally abusive to both me and my younger brother (he's even done this to my sons). I broke down and couldn't stay quiet anymore. I told him he was being abusive and I wouldn't be abused any more. I'm not a little girl anymore, I'm a woman and deserve respect of my feelings too. He says be a good girl and respect him... he just never gives that in return. Ever! I let these months pass. Thinking of my dad and how none of us kids are close to him anymore and feeling sad. Now that I have kids, I don't ever want them out of my life. Don't ever want my kids to feel they're not loved.   So I called my dad and told him it's sad that we're alive but act as though the other doesn't exist. I don't want that. I think of you and hope you're ok. We talk for 2 minutes and he has to go. No hostile words were exchanged. So I figure this might work if I screen his phone calls first and get a feel for his mood. But he never calls back. A month later Christmas comes and goes. I have his present under the tree, no call. My birthday passes. Nothing. I call him earlier this week. No return call. Call him yesterday and let my little guy leave him a message. My dad calls back and I forgot to screen, I was just excited that he actually called back. But he's hostile and throwing all kinds of harsh words and accusations and hatred. Anything I say he talks over. He says let him finish. I listen and start to speak and he does it again, I can't get a word in! He tells me to never call again, never come to see him. I ask him if he's really saying that I'm dead to him. He says not to put words in his mouth, but isn't that what he's saying? Just throwing me away?! I believe in unconditional love, and would still let him in my life if he only asked. How do I separate myself from this abusive man, I use that word thinking it will concrete the truth...but he's my dad the only one I have. I have my own family now, but how do I bury my dad when he's still alive? How do I let go and mourn, so I can heal and be whole?
20090131194227AAxafRb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this jerk?	There's this guy I used to like a while ago. He found out I liked him in I guess seventh grade because my friend accidentally told his friend, but she paid him off so he wouldn't tell him, but he did anyway. thats beside the point. the guy knows now I don't like him, because I flirt with this other guy now and talk about other guys a lot when I'm around him cuz I don't like him anymore, and I don't want him to think I like him anymore. So suddenly now i was walking around with two of my friends and he was wwith a couple of his popular guy friends and he coughed the word dyke specifically at me. My face turned red, and my friends are like what is he talking about. I am in no way a lesbian, not like I have anything against them, but I like guys. i've never really had a real boyfriend, and I don't want him spreading this rumor because some guys who I like now might hear it and stop liking me and I hate gossip. I don't know if I should confront him or not, what should I do? He's such a jerk, and i really don't want ppl thinking i'm a lesbian, cuz then guys wouldn't like me obviously. help!! so do you think he is saying this just cuz he's annoyed I don't like him anymore or what? Help!!

20090131202618AAoyCaT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Not really sure how to handle this juvenile situation...?	My best friend is almost 30 and has never had a boyfriend.  She's always just had a first or a second date, but nothing beyond that.  She met a guy that she really likes and blew me off two weeks ago when he called at the last minute and told her he wanted to go out with her that night.  Tonight we had plans to go out when he called (again last minute) to tell her that he wanted to see her.  Once again, she blew me off....she hadn't seen him since their last date two weeks ago.  My friend is not the type to admit when she's wrong and becomes really defensive when you confront her about things like this.  I don't want her blowing me off to become a habit and I'm not sure how to talk to her so that she'll understand my perspective.  Suggestions?

20090226090521AA7rWPm	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My boyfriend is in the wedding party?	Okay so here's the thing. Yesterday my boyfriend of 2+ years was invited to be in his friends wedding. (a groomsman) I really don't even know this friend or the  girl he's getting married to. I was told that since I am the g/f of someone in the wedding party, that I need to be present at the reception.I kinda feel weird about it though. I mean I don't know anyone and basically since my b/f has to sit at the wedding party table I have to sit with people I don't know at the reception. To top it off I don't even really get to be with my boyfriend until after dinner and after the wedding party dance. (where my b/f dances with who ever he's paired up with of the brides maids) I am not trying to be a party pooper or anything, I just feel weird about being there when I don't know anyone. I would really like some advice for how to stay upbeat and cool until I finally get with dance with my b/f. I know that a lot of people have been in my situation but this is my first time being the g/f of someone who's in the wedding party. Thank you

20090131202214AAu8YD7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Strange girl at school keeps bothering me/ asked me to a dance?	There is this girl at school that acts strange. I know who she is but i don't really talk to her. if i see her and she says hi i will say it back so i don't sound rude or anything but she is weird.      she comes up to my locker and always asks me stupid questions like do we have a test in this class and that class, then she will come up to me and tell me that i smell good.      In the class that i sit next to her she will sqeeze my knee and start touching my whole leg,  comes close to my crotch but she stops before she touches me in the private area, it pisses me off that she is touching me but i don't want to say anything because i think that i would over react.      then she asked me this one time if her thong was showing which was random, and stupid.      Then another time when we were working in groups she asks me if i will take her back to Europe (Where i am from) to marry her.  I live in Texas now that's why she said to go back there.      When i am talking to someone about something she will interuppt me and say " hold on, what are you guys talking about"  pretending like she didn't hear me so i have to explain it to her, but she sits right close to me.      I can't talk to my friends because we are a small school of like 400 students, if i talk to them then she will find out that i really hate her, then everyone will tell me that i am messed up for hating someone.   i try being nice but i don't like her and i'm nice to everyone but do you think that i should tell her to f*ck off?       I try avoiding her now but she asked me to a dance and i don't want to go with a freak like that. what should i tell her?

20090131192535AAUP4G9	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I move on from the grief of losing my closest friend>?	y bestfriend died on the day of her graduation. She was on her way to the cemermony with her boyfriend. While in the car they both had an arguement over something completely stupid like always. Jesse (the boyfriend) stupidly started speeding up a hill. Chrissy (my bestfriend) was afraid that he would kill them both. As they start to go down the hill, Jesse, slams on the breaks and the car flipped over and started tumbling down. Chrissy suffered severe head injuries and broken several bones. She slipped into a coma. Her dumb boyfriend walked about with minor injuries and a broken leg. Chrissy had no one in her life but me. I was the closest thing to a family to her. We've known each other since we were in diapers. She has always been there for me. The hospital contacted me when she was admitted. I raced over there to find my bestfriend motionless and covered in bandages. The doctors told me that I had to make the choice either to keep her on life support or take her off. She was declared brain dead. I did what I thought was best. I let her go. June 20, 2008 is the last time i saw my bestfriend. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss her. She is my angel. But I still wake up everyday with the guilt over my head knowing that I was the one who let her go. I miss her so much.

20090131190306AAcoUQ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys - He says a female friend wants to meet after our date? Is he testing me?	This guy I've been dating on/off for the past 6 months - and I are planning on hanging out tomorrow at the beach. I thought it was (most likely) going to be a very romantic afternoon.. we're going to have lunch, then stroll at some art galleries and go check out the beach. I've been looking forward to this for the last week.      Then last night.. he throws this weird monkey wrench.. we both live far from each other, so he asks, "What time do you think the date will end?" I was like, "Huh?" B/c then he said his close female friend wants to hang out after our date and I'm thinking why is he asking this?? I was about to get upset, but I kept my cool and said:      Well, if you want to go back and hang out with her... then go ahead. I'm not going to stop you. But I felt kind of bad (for me) saying that.. he paused and said, "Well that's nice of you."       I actually don't think he's going to do that.. but is he doing this as a test? Sadly, he's done kinda similar stuff like this in the past, but I always got angry and would pick a big fight with him. So I would like to know? Why do [some] guys do this? Thanks.
20090131191623AARtpHu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I get a girlfriend?	Ok, I'm 18, a senior in high school, and I have never had a girlfriend, never had a date, or even be kissed.      I've asked veryone and nobody can figure it out, even guys who said they could.      -Most people say I'm handsome, not sexy, but handsome, I'm 6'1, tan all year around, mixture of Italian, German, and Native American, but I look more Native American. I keep my hair a buzzcut all year around. I have dark, piercing eyes. I'm big, somewhat buff, some meat, but not a whole lot. I wish I had a pic.   -I'm somewhat social, I talk to girls and guys. Most girls don't get along with me for some reason.   -I've never smoked weed, cigarettes, done an illegal drug, or even drank alcohol. I have a 3.0 GPA, earning college credit currently and work 15 hours a week, and yes, never call off. I even do community service hours for one of my classes, 15 a quarter. I'm aimed to be successful.   -My hobbies include many things, I'm anti-cliques and conformity. I like baseball, football, reading, writing, swimming, hiking, board games, movies, TV, video games, and anything really.      But for some reason, I can never get along with girls, they always want to instigate fights with me. I've asked out four girls, all said no, and they weren't nice about it. No girl has EVER asked ME out, unlike all of my friends.      Why? Nobody can figure it out? I'm good looking and I'm a great person, better then most people my age.

20090131195529AAGQ7Ki	Family & Relationships;Friends	How come every guy friend I have wants to hook up with me and how do i prevent it?	Every time a guy askes to hang out I'm so naive and think that thats all want to do...wrong! Someone always puts the moves on me and it makes things awkward when I say I'm not into them like that. I don't get it though. There's no evidence that I'm a slut on campus (and there shouldnt be), I'm not very flirtatious but friendly, awkward, and goofy, and I never ever imply that I'm into them. So ,what is it about me that triggers something in these guys and how do i prevent it? because I'm losing guy friends here and it would be nice to still have some    Oh and I'm not super attractive ,but fairly average looking so i highly doubt its bc of my looks    I'm 19 and a freshman in college  i'm not used to the attention so I'm clueless when it comes to boys intentions
20090131192631AAN6lDu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Helpp my friend ran away and...?	my friend ran away she is 17 turns 18 on april 28.    the reason she ran away is because she has been phsyically abused her whole life to the point of where she has a broken rib that will never be the same and pops in and out. and has been stabbed by her mother. the physical abuse stopped a while ago but it switched to emotional abuse and being told that she did not deserve to live. however a few weeks ago her mom tried to run her over twice in the same week.      she showed up at my house today and had been missing since friday. her mom lied to the cops and said she had been missing since last weekend and that she stole 600 dollars just to try to get her in trouble. the cops took her from my house i am worried because i do not want them to fall for her moms lies and excuses for hte injurys she has had.       what can i do? whats going to happen? anything helpful advice?
20090131190517AAh7oTA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am i shut off from the rest of the world?	i dont really get out much, but when i do its mostly just w/ a bunch of friends. i spend a lot of time in my room, listening to music, at sports. but i keep telling myself to get out more. there's nothing to do when im out and my only type of transportation is my bike, so i don't go out often. im thinking i might get out more when im in high school because i would want to get more friends then my friends from elementary. so, am i or am i not? if i am, any tips?
20090226090703AAgTU8Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help me with friend trouble?	I usually find these kind of questions dumb but anyway...      I joined a new school recently because I moved really far away from my old one. I've been there for about 7 months now. I'm having trouble talking with people, but the thing is it's the people that arent in my class I want to talk to... Let me explain: In my class I do have a lot of friends, and they are all nice but they are a bit weird... My year is divided into groups of 4. In one of the other classes there is a ''group'' of people I want to make friends with. I know this sounds loserish but yeah.... At the start of the year we talked a lot, but only because I was new I think. We dont really talk at all anymore... I get the train with one of them every morning, and she talks to me but not really in school.       I wanna be fit in with them. =].       And if your going to say ''Dont change yourself for people'' it's not like that, we all like the same things more or less. And just because we DO like the same things doesnt mean we HAVE to be friends either but I want to so badly.      Any tips?
20090131190821AAR3ZF9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are guys so confusing? I need help. I cant understand.?	Well the guy that I liked and my friend had told me that he liked me also finally asked me who I liked. I didn't have the guts to tell him then so I flipped the question and asked him who he liked and he said no one.      Then two nights later he said you never told me who you liked. I didn't wanna be straight forward with him so I said "I'll give you hints and you can guess and I will tell you" so he agreed. He said a few people the finally asked if it was him. I said yea it is and he said "Oh..wow.." so I got scared and was like I don't want it to be awkward between us and he said it won't. and it hasnt since but now he teases me about other guys he thinks I like and he will randomly text me. Is he hiding that he really likes me or does he not??      If it helps he was my boyfriend in Kindergarden and my first kiss even though that really doesnt count. If it helps we are both 15.      Any Idea??

20090131192237AATJytP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Irrational fear of sounding silly?	My boyfriend recently told me he wishes he would hear more positive feedback from me. It's not that I don't think positive things about him. Quite the contrary. I know we're young (20 and 21) but I really feel something for him that I've never felt before.       Every time I think of a comment to say to him though, I feel like it would sound really dumb if I said it out loud. He's told me the most beautiful/poetic things, but I just can't make myself verbalize my most intensely happy thoughts. "I love you" isn't a problem, but beyond that is where I start to have difficulty.       I write a lot, and some of my poems are about him, but I don't share them with anyone. I feel like I would be comfortable showing him something I wrote, but I also feel that he would appreciate it more if I said something out loud.      Why am I so afraid to tell these things to him? Any suggestions on getting over it? He's gone for the week so I was wanting to work on this while he's away...

Ok, so I like this guy and we have sort of dated before but at the time he wasn't allowed to date because his parents are really strict. He's sixteen now and they've changed their minds. He's a sophmore and I'm a freshman btw. So anyway we have started "talking" again and he came over today to kick my butt at Rock Band 2 and just hang out. My problem is that I'm horrible at letting my true feelings show. I mean I was flirtatious... but I was also giggly. If I like a guy I will either giggle too much(I can't control it.) or make a sarcastic remark. I need to be able to overcome this cause I want to make this work. Any advice you could give me?

Example: If you have issues with males, would it be likely that you would have a male child to give you patience, tolerance and understanding? or if you struggle  in relationships with either parent, God will bless you with a child of the same sex of the parent to better you as a parent.

I completely trust her. She is smart, funny, like able, and from what I know, hasn't told any secrets. Every time I try and tell her, she says she "doesn't want to hear it" or threatens to stop texting or call. I asked her why, and she says she doesn't trust herself. When I bring it up in every day conversation, she says she won't listen, or its "not the time". She is NOT a mean person, and what she's doing is nothing like herself. I was recently almost raped, and the person who attempted this told me how worthless, horrible, and friendless I am and will always be. It happened at my school's campus. He was sent to Juvenile Detention and expelled. My family knows about it. I just remember what happened sometimes, and no one at my school knows. (I go to a different school now because I moved) I feel like I need to be close to my friend. It helps me feel safe and protected from harm. (She does self-defense and martial arts). Just thinking about what happened has been stressing me out. How can I tell her my secret? I'm afraid she'll ignore me/hang up on me.
20090131195246AAVQqmX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me or my man part?	I've been seeing this girl for the last few years but she never really seems interested in me. She will come around for a while and we'll do our thing then she will just disappear. I really enjoy spending time with her and we have a lot of fun together.   I think the problem is that I am well endowed. This isn't  the first time its happened with her or other girls but I was wondering after all this time if its me or is it just the girls I've been after? If it is just about the sex what should I be doing about it, I don't want to go celibate.      This is a real question and not an attempt to pump up my ego.
20090131191002AAUO9mE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ahh yes, it IS another guy question!?	Alright. This is probably your typical "Does he like me?" question.      There is this boy in some of my classes that I'm having a hard time reading.  He's really smart, and so am I, (we're in all honors classes together) but I'm really not that fond of him.        We sit by eachother in English and he talks to me a lot.  He always asks for help (even though he knows what to do) and he often copies my work.  He adds on to my work and gloats whenever the teacher gives him those two extra points. He gets a lot of attention from other girls because every girl in school thinks he's cute.  I mean sure he is, but I think he's really immature.  He makes these weird farting noises around me just to make me respond.  Whenever I'm reading and I laugh at the book, he pretends to laugh at his book.  He steals my pens and pencils and always asks for gum.  He even tells me to smell his binder because he doesn't know what it smells like.  Sometimes I even catch him looking at me at lunch.  Whenever he's with his friends, he's sort of a jerk, like he's trying to be funny, but whenever we're partners for something (God forbid that we never be partners) he's really nice and he doesn't act like a neanderthal.       He sits in between me and one of my friends who likes him and always tries to flirt with him, but he never really talks to her.     Some of my friends think he likes me, some of them say that we look good together, but personally I am just not that into him. (haha...)    He says that he doesn't like anyone, but I'm not quite sure if I buy that.      So for the sake of knowing, does he like me?
20090131202208AAXlQrJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Plzzzz helllp. question about my friend!?	okayyy. so one of my really good friends is a really good girl. she's pretty and like shes a virgin and like she doesn't do drugs and all this ****. and i really like that about her. but EVERYONE is my school is a total skank. well not everyone, but most of them. and my friend is getting influenced and wants to be like everyone else. so she's planning on blowing and having sex with this random 16 year old guy. and i'm getting really pissed cuz she's NOT like thiss!!!!! by the way- were 14 in 8th grade. so plzz help. my other friend is on the phone with her and i NEED to give her advicee!

20090131190923AAJWItZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do to get this girl to understand we dont want to be friends with her?	Okay there is this girl I met in like 2nd grade. Me and my BFF hated her so much but we got introuble if we didnt act like we were friends. She lied ever since 2nd grade and now into sixth. (thats the grade im in now.) Me,Torrey,Carrey,and Anne have been acting like we were her friends because she doesnt have any since she lies so much and shes so annoying. So Anne,Carrey and I put our foot down and we wrote her a note saying we chose not to be friends anymore. She started crying at school and she like begged us to be her friends but we said ''We don't take begs, Haylie. We are sick of you attitude. You lie all the time. If you keep this up, you will no longer have friends. We are not obligated to being your friend either. There is much less stress in our lives without you." And I remember in 3rd grade she said to me if she doesnt have any friends she would kill herself. o.0   So now at school she watches Anne and I like a hawk. IDK what to tell her that we are NOT her friend and we want her to leave us ALONE!   Please help! What should I do?

20090131202719AAEyqZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do now? =(?	Okay, so I'm basically going out with this guy like 2 years older than me and who happens to also be my sister's ex....YES I know I may come off as a horrible person doing this BUT thing's just happened to be so..if I knew that it would be HIM (the ex of my sister) then trust me, I wouldn't have liked him...But I guess liking him too much just took over me at the time.. =/..And for like 3 months, me and my sister was conflicting a lot and she kept a grudge on me. YES I KNOW I KNOW, I'm sucha horrible person to even fall for him, but I'm sorry I can't control my feelings .. And in those 3 months, she has not been making my life very easy either, let's just say she hurt me in no way that ANYONE could. She totally just ruined me...ANYWAYS, back on topic..Okay since I don't live close to him and I have school and he has work, I only see him once or sometimes twice a week. Everytime I do go see him, he seems to be pretty happy to see me as well and such. BUT recently, for the past week or so, he doesn't call anymore..he doesn't seem to want to talk to me on MSN, not really talking much and giving like one word answers, and I can sense that he seems like he'd much rather do something else than sit there and talk to me..AND      today at the mall, there was also this other girl with us, she's a close friend as well, to me AND him..And I have said before that I think that they like each other and stuff to my other friends and they just think I'm saying random crap and making excuses and stuff (this was before we went out). They just say that he's really close to her and stuff like friends. Well, today it seemed as if he didn't even know I was there, he didn't even walk with me at all (he used to), he didn't talk to me much. It's almost as if he tried to lessen the interaction. It's like he didn't even know I was there. And as for the girl, he seems to be really happy with her and he talks to her a lot like I would talk to my best friend. MAYBE they are just really close but I'm not too convinced. He seems pretty flirty with her. I told my others friends and stuff about this and they suggested that I dump him because he's a jerk. I really don't know what to do because at this point, I like him A LOT. Oh and me and my sister are pretty cool now, maybe she figured that **** happens. I don't know what to do, and I wished I did. Sorry if I come off as a jerk doing that to my sister but I just couldn't control my feelings.
20090131193624AAWiAbY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She only likes me as a friend????? ?	She put me in the friend zone!!!!

20090131194111AAlUxbb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Datable material for boys? pictures included. ?	ok, so I know this is a really cruel/cold question, but I'd rather have honest opinions from strangers than from people I seriously know.       so the main fact is: i've never had a serious boyfriend and I am currently 15.    and honestly, I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. :(   I try to keep up with my looks: i don't walk around in hobo clothes or anything. and I don't have a really rotten personality or anything.    I've had people admit to me that they like me: but I just never know what to do after that! right when I'm about to walk up to them and set things straight, they always seem reeeally preoccupied with other girls.   I've also had ask-outs, but they just felt so random for me: from boys i didn't feel i knew well enough.   am i just being really picky? and why do all the jerks always admit to me that they like me? are there really any decent guys out there?   (haha, sorry, lots of questions)        honest answers please. please do not be too rude about this.

20090131191727AAAMIkA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people have to know who you like all the time?	Okay I was thinking of this a couple days ago.   Like when I was younger my friends would sometimes talk about the girls we liked at stuff like that (it was super rare). But I remember I was really good friends with this girl for a really long time and we were like brother and sister. Soon everyone thought we liked each other in a boyfriend and girlfriend way, but we honestly didn't at all because we talked about it. So I usually never said who I liked at all because of the simple reason I didn't like anyone in middle school that way. So I would say "No I don't like anyone." and my friends would often be like "you gotta like someone here!" and again I would tell them NO!   so they got pissed I guess and started saying that I liked this girl who I was super good friends with.   and it totally ruined our friendship it ticks me off because I could have had a good girl that was my friend.   I know this doesn't just happen to me.    I hate it honestly I'm not interested in who likes who, never really was.   So why on earth do people just have to know who you like.   Honestly it ruins friendships.      so if someone who read this whole thing give me a reasonable answer!      P.S.   I was never friends with this girl or my friends in this story ever again!

It is obvious that this girl in my class thinks I'm cute   because she has the whole personality and everything.      This is very strange, but my teacher said I'm cute.   I play guitar and am very good at it.   I am shy and don't talk much.   All the girls that like cute guys talk to me,   but the apparent "dumb blonde" girls see right through me.      I'm not very smart, but still get a "B" average in the smart classes.

20090131192814AATLqjR	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do if my mom is a alcoholic?	Well my mom is a alcoholic and she has been i think forever she is 50 years old and she cannot take her hands off alcohol even if i tell her to well this is how it started that i can remember im 13 and ill start this off from my age now which is 13 years old. here is the problem.      My mom is 50 years old and she is a alcoholic/alcoholic abuser. My mom always drinks beer wine and it makes me so depressed and sad and i feel like running away from home. My mom drinks like 4 bottles of wine everyday and like 20 beers everyday and it smells so bad her breath when she talks slurring massively she can't hardly walk when is she drinking. My mom hides the wine and beer someplace for example like the cabinets when im trying to look for it she hides it so i can't find it. My mom has short hair and it gets all crazy when she is drunk/drinking. She has short hair and it looks pretty like she puts hairspray in it then when she is drinking every minute it gets all crazy and she looks ugly her face is all like it has no make up on it when she is drunk/ drinking and her eyes are going every where all over the place like they are rolling and her eyes are big when she is drunk and its ugly i can't take it anymore I actually have to watch her I call it baby sitting my mom when she is drunk so she doesn't drink beer/wine. Today she is drunk to and also she is slurring her words and she is dropping the TV remote its annoying and I just have had it I can't take it anymore and you know what my dad doesn't care he just really doesn't care and my sister doesn't either she is basically never home she is with her friends all the time and its so annoying my mom is just a mess. When my mom is drunk/drinking she always calls her supposively friends on the phone for like 10 hours and doesn't stop calling her friends she doesn't have anyone to talk to when she is drunk. She always calls her friends when she is drunk its so annoying and she swears to when she is talking to her friends she swears so much i've never heard someone swear like that ever. The swearing has to stop also its so annoying I feel like running away from home I have had it and she never stops drinking. My dad stopped drinking why doesn't she. My mom drinks too much and right now she went to bed because she is drunk I actually found a empty bottle of wine which is 14% alcohol she drunk the whole bottle and I just threw it outside in the snow that's how mad I get when she is drunk I would either break the bottle in the garage or throw it on the ice in the winter. She slurrs when she talks its so annoying and she is just a alcohol abuser swhe can't stop and my dad won't bring her to rehab he says supposively to him that she has to agree to go to rehab and I bet she will never agree with my dad she needs rehab I have asked my dad several times can mom go to rehab and let me tell you my dad is a softy and he is very nice and i love my daddy he is the best and so is my mom but I just don't like it at all when she is drinking it makes me sad, mad, and depressed. It is hard for me because I love talking to my mom when she isn't drunk its cool because I can like tell her anything I want to tell her she is like my best friend and I can tell her anything I want to tell her I can totally trust my mom I love talking to her when she isn't drinking but when she is drinking it makes me sad because alot of my friend's mothers don't drink at all and I wish my mom never drank at all. When I ask my mom if she has been drinking she says nope when she really has been drinking because its so obvious in her voice she is slurring and when u look at her hair it gets all crazy like it got struck by lightning which im setting an example of lightning because her hair is all crazy like its gelled up but it isnt gelled up but anyways when u look at her also you can tell that her eyes are big are moving every where. That is how you can tell if she is drinking even if she has one sip of beer she will be drunk also I don't know why but it's weird. Also when she is drunk she never flushes the toliet when she is using the bathroom and she goes to the bathroom when she is on the toliet doing her business in the bathroom she is on the phone while she is doing her business in the bathroom I know ew and she NEVER FLUSHES THE TOLIET OR WASHES HER HANDS NEVER AND SHE MAKES ME AND MY DAD AND MY SISTER FOOD TO EAT SHE TOUCHES THE FOOD FOR SUPER AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN WASH HER HANDS WHEN SHE IS DONE DOING HER BUSINESS IN THE BATHROOM! ITS SO DISCUSTING AND SHE MAKES ME EAT SUPPER/DINNER THAT SHE MAde. It is so discusting she touches the food I eat and she doesnt even wash her hands after she uses the bathroom that has been going on for a long long long long time its so discusting. One time I was in the kitchen eatting carrots while she was drunk on the toliet going to the bathroom and the next minute i had to use the bathroom and she didnt even flush the toliet and wash her hands in the sink and guess what when I wa
20090131192857AA60xaM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Becoming more than "Just Friends" ?	This boy and I have been friends for seven years.   We have so many things in common and we have never fought in any way. Actually we always agree with each other.   We've watched each other grow up, and change.   Now we are both sixteen. I picture myself with him in the future,   and in my eyes, we couldn't be more perfect together.   I find that I get this funny feeling in my stomach when ever I'm near him. I've never had a boyfriend, nor have I asked anyone out.   I wouldn't say we have a brother-sister friendship, because we have definitely flirted before.   It's just that I don't know what to do to kick start the transition from    friendship to relationship.   help?

20090131193543AAvR43A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being blown off?	I met this guy on myspace who lives 45 minutes from where I live to go to school, 10 from where my parents live, and I visit them on weekends sometimes. So he isn't far away.      We talked on MSN and yahoo a bit and I've called him twice. We seemed to have meshed well together so far. A large part of what we talked about was sex, like preferences and stuff. We also fooled around a bit on the phone too and with me on cam for him.      There's a couple things though, last time we talked on the phone this guy asked me to be his girlfriend. At first I was hesitant but after we were done on the phone I told him on Yahoo I would be. Then after thinking about it considering so far how our things have been, I kinda had some worries. so I emailed him about it and he reassured me he wants me to be his girlfriend and more than someone to just fool around with.      Along with that he won't meet me until April when his classes are done, which I can kind of understand because he works and has school. At the same time it kind of worries and disappoints me. Also I added him on myspace and all of his top friends are girls and he has a bunch of old comments, all from girls too. One girl asked him on the 8th, "hmm can your status still be "singlee"? :P "      So it makes me worry he's stringing me along, that and the fact its been three or four days since I've heard anything from him.... I might call him tomorrow depending on if I get any advice. just want to hear some thoughts, like if I'm too paranoid. Anything works.

20090131195750AAGST3Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help? i need freaking help?	Im 16 years old, my name is francis but my friends call me kiko. This  girl is always staring at me, and when I look at at her she pretends that she is looking at the window. Then when i try to talk to her she turns really red and runs away. Then when she runs away her friends start flirting with me. They say that im really cute the other girl say that im hot. Then I stay with her groups of friends and i start talking to them. Then she comes back and she get all mad cause her friends are flirting with me, and i think she gets jelouse. I really like her but she always runs away. Then one day I swear to god I see this guy out of nowhere come to the school and starts screaming and saying bad words to her then everyone gets really scared, then i was thinking if i really like this girl i should protect her.                                                   Then i went to the guy and i said, to leave her alone, and then he just said mind your own buisness and he pushed me away, then i said leave her alone thats no way to treat a girl, and he said shut the f*** up. My friends were like come on just mind your own buisness, and i didn't listen to them. Then i told the guy that he should shut the f*** up, and fu*** leave her alone. Then he got psst of and he punshed me in the face, and i punshed him back and it was a fight. He made me bleed, and i made him bleed, then the girl started to cry and said to stop fighting, then she said to me please stop fighting I don't want to see you hurt and she was hugging me, and then she was silent for 2 minutes and she said that she fell in love with me. Then i didn't know what to say, i was hurt and surprise, then the guy heard her and he left, and then she ran, I wanted to go after her but i was really hurt so my friends took me to the nurse,and i rest in the nurse office.                                       I don't know if im in love with her. Do you think it was the right choice to protect her?

20090131203614AATP6Jh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this really life or is it too late? ?	Ever since I was 8 I couldn't stop thinking about life,science,religion,death,existence and non-existence.By 9 I realized every single religion is basically just the same s**t.I started asking questions about everything.I mean like what if what we are living is just the flashback and we are all dead.Or if this is all just an imaginary existence because we`re all crazy and every person you see is just a different version of you. I`m not asking whats the meaning of life but I am asking what rather how do we know this is all real. I`m a logical person so you better have an explanation. I`m hoping to get an answer from a super-string theorist with some free-time or just a regular guy trying to figure it all out or maybe an incredibly lazy genius like me.

20090131214558AAgoHjf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I miss her very much, but should i do something?	Ok, so i met this girl on a cruise on vacations a year ago... she was the most amazing girl i've ever met. she seemed to understand me in every way. its like she had known me all my life.       eventually we started going out but we knew it was going to end when the cruise ended as well. i remember on the last day, she looked at me with those sad eyes, like she truly understood exactly how i felt,and i also knew she was very sad and was going to miss me. i was really sad, but i thought that time would mend that pain eventually.       she lives in Brazil and i live in chile. we stayed in contact for like a month or 2, but one day, without a warning, she disappeared. her facebook was erased, and she never used her msn or email again.       i couldn't understand, she had just disappeared out of my life. every day i kept thinking about her, even though i tried to forget her.       a while ago she appeared on msn, it had been such a long time i didn't know what to say, so we still didn't talk. 2 days ago, i left my msn open, and when i got back there was a message from her. it only had one line: "i miss you so much..." she had already disconnected.       i was so happy that she still remembers me, and still cared for me, but on the other hand i don't know what to say to her, the truth about my feelings towards her?       i really want to see her again, but i'm just 17 so i really can't do that. please give me some advice, thnx
20090226085055AAojkPs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do I legally have to communicate with stepmom?	My EXH and I have been divorced for over 4 years. Two years ago he remarried.. I have been remarried for over 3 years. We have joint custody of our two girls. I am the primary custodial parent so they live with me and they have EOW visitation with their dad. Their dad is still bitter re the divorce and for the majority of the time refuses to speak with me about the kids, visitation, etc. Instead he tells me I need to speak with his wife. I don't feel I legally should have to discuss our kids with her. He and I are the parents, our divorce agreement is between us. They are our children. Per our divorce decree WE are supposed to share information regarding anything pertaining to the kids. In addition she or on a rare occasion he will call me and give me a blow by blow play of their weekend which entails all the things the kids did wrong. Now I don't call him up every time the girls fight at home or every time they get a bad note from the teacher etc. I have a therapist I've been going to and she says that them calling me up and complaining about the kids isn't co-parenting. She says I am not obligated to talk with stepmom and I shouldn't have to sit there while she goes on and on with a beeoch session about my kids.      I always give their dad report cards and school progress cards. I let him know when special events are at the school. I send him copies of all medical and dental records, etc. I am doing my part according to the decree on keeping him informed of all things related to the kids. I do not see how legally I should let him know each time the kids act up in my house and I don't want to know what goes on in theirs because there have been times when I have disagreed with his constant spanking and yelling and it just ends up in an arguement. There is nothing I can say or do that will change what they do in their home. It's their weekend and their parenting time. It's not like we can discuss anything because it's their way or no way so what is the point? All it is is them badmouthing the kids. His wife talks down to me and says bad things about my kids. I feel I am legally doing everything I can on my end to keep their dad informed regarding the kids. Anything regarding discipline in their house is nothing I can do about.
20090226085256AA7mYUu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex left me this IM?	My Ex:      I miss you...i can honestly say my life hasn't and will never be the same without you. losing you has been the most painful experience i've ever encountered in my entire life, so painful I wanted to die. I'm not even sure if I still believe in God in anymore. I figure I must have dome something awful to someone, if not you, along the way to deserve this. You leaving me was probably the best thing for you especially since you came out on top but losing you, as much as I still love you, was the worst thing for me.      I cheated on him while we were together and got engaged right after we broke up which was about 9 months ago. I don't know what to make of this...what would you think?      He didn't do anything to me, I just wasn't happy.

Since December thru now I have been staying there everyday...leaving my apt. vacant.      I have offered to go home and what not, but he insists I stay. I practically live there and even pay a few bills of his ONTOP of mine.      My apt is now a stoage bin that Im paying 700 $ a month on.      However, I have mentioned moving in a few times an he isnt neg. toward the whole idea but he feels any realtionship that moves in together to soon is bound for disater. Which I don't believe.      He also thinks on both sides. He doesnt want to make a mistake moving me in.      What do I do ?      I have this 700$ payment a month for a another year an I am never there.

20090131091755AAa0yuM	Family & Relationships;Family	Mother despies me ,cant figure out why -can anyone help?	My mothers feelings towards me have now made me knob, but i thought just out of pure curiousity- I'd ask for your opinion on my mothers feelings towards me      Let me begin- I was born the youngest of 3 children,two of which have a mental age of 15 , the other 17(which may have been because they where subject to intense emotional abuse and watching my mother get beaten). My mother came over from the West Indies via an arranged marriage. Throughout her 12 years marriage to my - (I dont like to address this man as father because he has been not a father in my eyes) father she had been subjected to both emotional and physical abuse - I think now she still harbours some resentment.      My so called father is now remarried and living aboard and i think myu mother also resents him for this       Anyways i didnt realise how much she disliked me until i was 12 when she neglected all her motherly duties and wouldnt do anything for me- I had to do everything myself. She always compared me to my cousins - whom at the time where very successful in their careers etc. No matter what i did , it wasnt good enough.      My auntie was the same , because my sister and brother are mentality retarded , my aunt refuses to see me as being any different , despite the fact i went to a better school and am very articulate, smart etc..Throughout my life i had to prove myself because of this       When i was 20 , fed up with the emotional put downs by my mother - i pushed myself to get good grades and when the opportunity came for me to go to university , i jumped at it- I was sick of the abuse - When i recieved good grades my mother didnt once congratulate me , but instead wanted to put stops in my way.      When i recieved the offer from the university - i was asked to pay ￡100 a fee for the halls of residence. At the time i had just finished college and didnt have any money and i asked my mother - she refused . I managed to eventually get money together and i was off- It was such a relief      5 years on and i graduated and when i called her to tell her this, she didnt want to come to ceremony because she said  the train fare is too expensive(it was ￡119) it wasnt until my school lecturer made me aware of a cheaper service , which was for hger to travel by Mainland midland, she decided to come- and even then I was the one that had to fork out for this.         My mother has always never been there for me emotionally and when i challenge her about this, she changes the subject or terminates the call      Just recently  i was promoted in my job ,all my friends sent me cards congratulating me , but not my mother - she didnt once call to congratulate me      Just last week i came very close to loosing my dream car . I had been saving for over 8 months , my mother refused to help and when i finally found my dream car and i was down by ￡200 , she turned to me and said " You better not get it. Where are you going to get ￡200 from?" - It was adamant to get the car - later that week , i asked her - she was angry and didnt want to lend me , but eventually she did      Unable to understand why she treats me like she does , one day i asked her right out. I said " Did you decide to have me because you felt it was your last ditch to save your crumming marriage"- she hesistate and stumbled and i thought from then i had hit the kneel on the head      Despite the fact she treats me like worser than a dog i have always been kind and protective of her and would always stick up for her and wouldnt let anyone say a mean word against her- I think also she resents me for being gay because im the only one in the family that is "bright" and the others have are retarded , she was banking on me to have the kids       I would like to know what you all think?

20090131144936AATrJG8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people get so bent out of shape over relationships?	i don't get it.   honestly not everything works out and there is nothing you can do about it most times. so why be all depressed and make a big deal about it.      the best thing is to just move on.       and the whole love thing. i feel its over-rated.   dont get me wrong love is a beautiful thing. but people try to hard to find it. and then they get in a relationship and think there in love then break up and are in love with someone else. to me that just makes no sense. love can be a great thing but now a days most cases are just completely over-looked. and then it makes the real thing not as special anymore.      any one agree or disagree, i would love to hear your thoughts.       thanks
20090226091546AA6Exc4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you talk when u are angry?

20090226092012AAyqrZS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My family questioning my parenting?	I am a young mother but take care of my child very well. I just took my child over to my grandmothers and she got mad at me b/c I put my 20 month old in a bloomer out fit. She said "Isn't it to cold for her to wear that outfit?" Then she pointed out that I was wearing  sweater. In actuality I am moving and do not have many clothes to wear. It is a beautiful day- 75 degrees outside. I just feel that since I am a young parent people tend to question my parenting more than the average mother. My mother questions my parenting all the time. Even when I discipline my daughter she often says that I am so mean. My daughter hears her saying this and it is even harder to get my daughter to listen to me and to follow my direction. I don't know if it is just me being defensive or if it is them being critical? What do you think?
20090226092024AAK4lC5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get over this guy?	I've been out with him twice now, the first time he said he broke up with me because he didn't want to hurt me and he thought he would. On valentines day, he asked me back out because he said he still had really strong feelings for me and he was going to do his best to make it work this time.      Then this morning, I got a text from my friend [she forwarded a message from him to me because he gets free texts to her] saying he still really loves me and this isn't the end, but he can't be with me for now because he's got too much coursework and revision and it's stopping him seeing me which is making it a lot harder for him. He doesn't think seeing me once a week is enough and he thinks it would just ruin us if we tried to make do with that until he took his exams.         I'm really upset, and I just keep thinking he's perfect and I'd never want anyone else. I told him I love him and he said he loves me too but he thinks it's for the best that we're not together for now. Thing is the exams aren't until may and by then i think he will have moved on and I'll still be hanging on and waiting for him to come back.         I don't know what to do, help :/

20090226091540AAbZTPr	Family & Relationships;Weddings	In a wedding, would you do a cocktail hour if you are doing a buffet style dinner?	I want to do a traditional cocktail hour with open bar and hors d' oeuvres [just little finger foods and maybe fruit, not much]. I am also thinking of a buffet style reception, so I don't have to deal with the allergy issues. Buffet style also means that people can mingle and catch up...but that is what the cocktail hour is for. I mean, should I skip cocktail hour? I know most people will be going for the open bar. I've seen enough weddings to get that. My reception isn't going to be dry though. There will be wine and champagne served. So, keep the cocktail hour? Or lose it?

20090226091213AASuL6R	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I convince my Mom to not make me move in with my Aunt?	I was playing basketball with my friends at the school playground one day, when some guys who weren't very nice and started to mess with me and my friends, talking smack and whatnot. So, I got into a fight with them to get them to leave me and my friends alone. As soon as knocked down one, the others started to chase me. I ran home and told my mom everything. She paniced and told me to go pack my stuff and to move in with my aunt and uncle. She said they were part of a gang and I shouldn't have messed with them. How do I get her to change her mind? Or should I just move?
20090226092008AA3WRvY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband cannot orgasm during sex anymore.  WHY!!!!!??	I am having a problem in the bedroom.  We have sex about 3 times a week but for the last 3 weeks, he has not had an orgasm.  I have tried every position I can think of, given him oral, used every type of lube there is and still nothing. After about an hour, we are so tired that he just rolls over and falls asleep.      It is so frustrating, especially since we stopped trying not to get pregnant.  We don't have to worry about condoms or birth control, so if anything, the stress should be less. We aren't even seriously trying, so the stress is not there. Nothing has really changed between us emotionally, so I am confused.  What can I do to help my hubby enjoy sex?

20090226091450AA1gbZ2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Mature adults only please, detailed question I need help!?	Me and this girl have been dating for 2 months now and things had been going great. We both agreed about a week and a half ago that we were really happy with the way things were going. At that time she also told me "shes lucky I didnt give up on her", that it always makes her smile when I tell her I'm thinking about her, and she would tell me randomly that she was thinking about me. We live a couple hours apart so only see each other once or twice a week, but when we do we're very affectionate, sometimes kissing for long periods of time on end and laughing and joking around alot.      The past week and a half have been different though. Coming off of a really romantic valentine's day weekend we are talking less. We usually text each other and the enthusiasm that I'm used to her having seems gone. We barely talked the last week and a half and she said she's been very busy with school and work but that she didnt forget about me and that she likes the way things are good and she's doing good.       Friday she said she definitely wants to see me this week, but our texts are still more sporadic and less "lovie dovie" I guess. I decided I would give her her space and didnt contact her until monday just to see when she wanted to get together. She got back to me tuesday, apologized for not getting back to me sooner, but said she was studying and running errands, etc.       Tuesday we set up plans for thursday night, but again last night we texted back and forth and the enthusiasm wasn't there. Her tone and everything was just noticably off. I asked her where we were going today because I made a suggestion Tuesday and she said she "likes that idea". Anyhow I'm seeing her tonight.      I don't know why she's been acting so strange lately. I'm afraid she's trying to create distance from me or something but I can't understand why. Everything was going perfectly and she was reciprocating my feelings for her and vice versa. Does it sound like I have anything to worry about tonight like she will drop the bomb on me and reject me suddenly? Would her feelings change despite nothing really happening? She's been working everynight and school, but I've been giving her space for that. I'm really afraid she's going to break my heart right when we were making a strong bond and heading into a relationship.

Every math class, whenever I go to erase something on my paper or something else that causes me to lean over, my teacher stops what he is doing and stares at my boobs for a solid 30 seconds, completely stopping class. Its not because he thinks it inappropriate because he smiles when he looks.

20090131144903AAM5nwh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Comebacks for being short ? ?	Everyday in my english class, this guy always teases me for being short, and we poke each other and stuff. It's not really mean, he's just like "You're so little" or "Midget!". I'm not really annoyed with the teasing that much, I'll just smile & be like "shut up". I want to start saying comebacks to make it funnier I guess ?       And he's not that tall either, he's only like 5'4" or 5'5", so any suggestions? ;] Thanks.  - Elle.

20090226090856AAXVKLz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it ok to take a new girlfriend to a restaurant where you used to take your ex?	There is a wonderful restuarant in my city that I love.  I would like to take this great girl I'm seeing because 1. I am very familiar with the restaurant and 2. It's the type of cuisine she says she loves.  The problem is that I took my ex there a couple times when we were together.  She never really liked the place much.  For me, however, the place has become one of my absolute favorites.  In fact, most of my favorite restaurants in this city are places I have taken my ex.        Should I take the new girl to a place I know and love or just try something completely new together?
20090226091646AAQ8IBg	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	When is enough, enough?	this is a sensitive question, so i ask that only people with a serious answer reply to my message.   My live in boyfriend of five and a half years, whom we have two children together...is what you might call a "functional alcoholic".   It is everyday, and its extrememly hard to watch and go through constantly.  I have tried on numerous occasions talking to him about it, asking that he cut down, explaining to him what i feel it does to the relationship. He tells me he'll cut down, but then he just hides it from me and continues on as if i wouldn't notice any difference.  Its hard for me bc of the children and the life we have built together.    What i want to know is, when is enough enough? Is it ok for me to have feelings of wanting to leave him? Or am is supposed to stick through it like a good partner should? I just dont' know what to do anymore.
