20090223080243AAwpJFw	Social Science;Psychology	How often do you cry and why?	Most people think when someone cry it's because something depressing, I don't. Crying could be of sooooo many reasons. Could be because something joyful happen to you, or you just need to feel better. And trust me, people who often cry endure pressures and pain better than those who like to keep things to themselves and lock it up inside. It's natural that our body will emotionally recover after we cry doesnt matter if you are a guy or a girl. It's not an embarrassing thing to do especially crying is something you mainly do in private.   So my question is .....   "How often do you cry and why?"   Remember, crying is a healthy thing. Everything is, just keep them at a stable level.   Would love to hear what you guys have to say.

I was at this place for something and they told me to take my shoes off so I did and I followed them into this room of little kids then we walked to this other room and they all had matching cowboy outfits. The pants were blue and the shirt was white.       Then these horses and dogs kept coming in and out of the room. Then we leave in this car and and go to this hotel lookin place.

Don't say it means nothing because dreams mean something.

20090223084220AAjx5kg	Social Science;Psychology	Am I Going Mad Or Is There Another Explaination For This?	Ever since I was a small child people have thought I don't pay attention, but that's not it. I just.... "space out". It's like I'm talking or getting into something and suddenly a chunk of time is gone! I could understand people thinking I was ignoring if it was in class or during boring tasks... I mean, it DOES happen then, but it also happens when I'm really excited about something. I've missed things I've been really excited to see because I space out. And it's gotten to be to where I can almost tell when I'm going to be spacing out more that day. It's like I can see flashes of light inside my own eyes, except it's always in my peripheral vision. Sometimes I'll hear a ringing with it or smell something rotting. Here in the past three years, my family has also noticed weird things in my sleep. They say that it'll seem like I am totally awake and aware for two or three minutes and I have zero recollection.That or during the day I'll notice scrapes and bumps that weren't there earlier. I don't remember injuring myself. I know it's not ADD.My friend with that already told me it can't be. I asked her because she has ADD and I was worried about it. I know it's not ADD. She said when I'm spacing out with her, it's like I'll just stop in the middle of a sentence for several seconds. Sometimes it can last over a minute and my arm will jerk a bit or I'll pick at something invisible on my shirt or side. My friends say it can be scary because I won't respond to anything. What's scary for me is when I get either deja vu, or what feels like the opposite of deja vu. It's like I'll space out and suddenly even in my own home I won't recognise any of my surroundings... it's like I'm in a stranger's house. And when I said I won't respond to anything, I mean it. One of my friends took a video and it showed them sticking a pin into one of my fingers and I did nothing. I was totally unaware of anything around me.

20090223085351AAKHvbY	Social Science;Psychology	How to forget a person who harmed you.?	I was at this event last night with kids around my ages, 12-14(im 13). They got bored and started throiwing food at people(it was a black-tie/formal event). This 1 girl threw a piece of slodgy carrot at this man who was wearing a quite nice suit.All this time i had not thrown anything at anyone, so i looked at him and he got up from his table and started shouting at us exclaiming:      "Which one of you little f*ck*rs" threw this at me. We were shocked as he was old enough to be our dad and yet he was swearing at us. After a short awkward silence he started staring at me really angry. I dont know what happend after that but all i remember is him going mental to me and my friends. I then stood up for myself and my mates and said:      "How the f*ck do you know it was me? How the hell do you know?    At that point the girl who did throw the food stood up and admitted it  but still he carried on. after him shotuing i once again stood up and said   " Even though she just f*c*ng admitted it you still shout at me you piece of sh*t? i'll f*ck*ng get some one on you!"       " Go on then!" he laughed      I then said i will and took out my phone.      JHe then ran back to his table where he wife was screaming for him to come back.      It then hit me that he was the father of a boy in my class, who im not to frienfly with yet i know him. He is also hugly unpopular. My mate told me he was his dad after the arguement. I then asked the boys who event it was to appologies to him from me, in hope to get one back from him. He did so but i didnt get a sorry. For the rest of the evening he kept giving me evils so i kept giving him this evil grin. I now feel kinda bad for that guy. Even though he started it i didnt behave the best i could. We are not bad kids, not at all. We have private eductations and are never experimenting with guns or drugs of drinking at all. I want to forget what happend all together but how?         -Hulk

20090223091038AAzNNIU	Social Science;Psychology	How do you handle fake, diplomatic people who you don't like?	You know the kind of guys who are cunning, and selfish on the inside, but play it cool with everyone on the outside, just so they can get things from others and use them/take advantage of them. And all thanks to their...charisma/diplomacy?      My question is, is it alright to say NO to them when they ask you for something? Coz I hate those kind of pretentious people.      Here's an example. A guy with the above description asked if he could borrow my CDs and stuff. I said "no sorry". Then he went around spreading that I am stingy and stuff. But If I need something from him, he will pretend to be really busy and engaged, and will never use the word "no" but will lie and cover up in a diplomatic fashion. But I like to be straight forward. So when I tell him 'no', because everyone thinks he's friendly/cool and don't see through him, they easily listen with all ears open when he brands me for being stingy. And note, I know he's being saying i'm stingy because people have come and asked me eg. "i heard from ___ that you're stingy. why didn't you lend him __?"      So am I supposed to give these types of jerks whatever they want or can I say no to them?

20090223094851AAWizQs	Social Science;Psychology	Please mature answers only bedroom romance?	I'm an older male, married 7 years and up to a point was having a great sexual relationship with my wife. I would say we ate, drank and slept sex for the first three years, then it started to dwindle to the point where I couldn't say for sure when the last time we had intercourse was. I have my own theories on the subject but not exactly sure if I would go into them in this forum.       My wife runs an in home business that is sexually oriented, her business endeavors ultimately lead to counseling, which she is really good at. Recently she received a letter from a client who's similar in age that basically spelled out the same problem we have, that is, lack of sex. And the client noted that the husband was completely uninterested in any bedroom romance. Not surprisingly, my wife asked me to give her an answer for the letter. Believe me I am suffering over this one, and I wish I could be more descriptive in my question but feel it is not a good place for one of my theories and why the problem could exist, not to mention a corresponding answer. The bottom line is; my answer would fit right into why my wife and I are not having a good sex life at this time, and I know this is what she is looking for (in my answer).      Should I bite the bullet and give my response (which will probably upset my wife) and give the answer of why the husband might not be interested in the bedroom? Or should I just tell her I don't have time to deal with the letter?      PS: Wife and I have a great relationship in all other areas of life. I can give detail in private mail if it would help, and I am not having an affair or playing around. Thanks to all those who are trying to give me an honest mature answer.

20090223090043AAuLSDA	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Confusing Dreams with reality?	I actually have more then 1 issue when it comes to confusing dreams with reality.       One issue is most prominent when i'm sick, but happens when i'm healthy from time to time. I have a dream that has only bits and pieces of it being vivid, but I wake up in my bed thinking that everything in the dream is still happening. I know where I am, but everything I feel like i'm doing is accomplishing a goal that takes place in the dream.      Another couple of incidents (one of them happened last night/this morning) is where I wake up in my room, normal as possible, no changes, funny enough it feels real. Then the dream takes place in front of me...       The other minor thing involved me feeling pain in a dream when I was a kid (probably normal in some cases). Mostly in the abdominal area.      Please note, i'm not trying to bs or anything, i'm wondering if this is normal or some sort of sleep disorder. I'm also wondering if anyone else has had these problems in the past.

Then I land and I can't control myslelf and go really high again and land in the busy intersection and wake up.   Another one I had years and years ago was I was running. I tried to get in myhouse and the door was locked and the light were truned out. i turned around and tea pots and plates and utensils were chasing me. The last weird one I remember was I was with a friend and we were trying to escape this ball of light. It was over his house and you could see it in his kitchen. We locked ourselves in my garage. What do these mean?

20090223100301AAC7ZCy	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is authoritarian government any better than patriarchy?	Do you think we'll ever get back to the days when Dad's word was law in the home? If not then do you think the State should step in to the family to replace emasculated or absent males when kids get out of control?   Young troublemakers could be confined to their homes, outside school hours, for a month under plans being unveiled by the Conservatives.     http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7...    He said tough action was needed to stamp out anti-social behaviour and said 10-year-olds caught causing trouble should be "sent home to bed".    Is it fair to say that a lot of women find combining the role of disciplinarian and primary care giver difficult if not impossible? Is a little bit of patriarchy exactly what children need?
20090223095810AAHHfgY	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Question on dreams - helpful answers only, please....?	I have a question.  I have some very odd dreams.  They are very vivid.  They come almost every night and are never the same, save for one important aspect - I am never ME in those dreams.        If I "see myself" in a window or a mirror, or even look down at myself in these dreams I am always some random person - and not someone I know either.      The kicker - they are very very violent dreams most of the time.  Someone is usually trying to do "me" harm - stabbings, shootings, strangling - very violent.      I have a very quiet, happy, content life, but these dreams do concern me.  I feel as though I'm supposed to "do something" with them, but I don't know what.      Any helpful advice would be appreciated.  Is there anyone out there that has dreams in which they are not themselves?  I know, it sounds like a sci-fi movie.      Thanks again

I walking down a neighborhood street when these dudes road past me and said whats up and pulled off.Next this Cute white girl pulled up to me in this sweet *** black car, as she looked at me I looked back at her and said let me out, She then gave me a mean look and pulled off.As I then continued to walk down the neighborhood, it all of a sudden went from grey and blue Sky's to darkness, luckily the street lights were on so I could still see.Im going back home I said as I then turned around and began to run, as I was running I would take little leaps in the air in wich I would begin to fly for a couple of seconds before I came back down. As I got to the street sign at the 4 way cross intersection I did one final leep in wich I begain to Gulide or fly for like 15 seconds just befor I landed and rolled on the concrete. As I then began to jog down the next street the sun had came back out, I then herd the voices of people talking, I then looked out of the corner of my eye In wich I saw the police, so I just keep jogging and minding my own business. When I got to my street I saw my neighbor, what are you doing Doug she said trying to fly I said as I then took another leep in the air and began to fly, she then looke at me and went into my house. Any Ideas people.

20090223075743AAGftMW	Social Science;Psychology	Are these things I should watch out for, or am I just paranoid?	I'm seeing a new guy. But something about him just rubs me the wrong way. I mean, I like him. He's gentlemanly, won't let me pay if I take him out. We seem to have a lot in common. Anyway, here's a list of things that kind of...bother me.      I'm becoming reluctant to hang out with him, because he's constantly trying to kiss me. A few times is ok, but if we're at the movies, if we're on a date, or if we're just hanging out talking, it's like he *needs* to be kissing me every 5 minutes. We've been dating about 2 weeks now.      We were just talking, and we were like 2 or 3 feet apart, and he asks why I'm so far away. Literally 90% of the time, he wants his arms around me. Which is nice...in moderation.      When he does start kissing me, if I gently push him to break the kiss, he sometimes doesn't respond.      He said he planned to see me today. But this is how he asked: "I'll be outside your house at 10:30. Ok?" I really didn't like that, and just canceled on him because I have much studying to do. Anyway, what do you think?

Jews don't bring up the fact that they were held in concentration camps and that they were getting burned alive and tortured in gas chambers. ok you got a black president. GOOD! but as soon as that whole excitement blows over, you'll be asking for another thing. blacks are never satisfied. and as for black people being accused of crimes, maybe if they cleaned up their image, they would be equally respected. but instead they choose to join the stereotypes and carry guns & join gangs."      and it went on & on. i just left the table.      i think both sides were wrong in their own ways. what do you think?

20090223094029AAcM1Fs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Arguing with boyfriend in my dreams only??!!?	So this is weird My boyfriend and I have been in a BEAUTIFUL relationship for 5 months now. We love each other sooo much and just argued once (but it wasn't really like arguing but sort of a conversation to clarify things) The thing is every time I dream about my boyfriend we are always arguing on my dreams. Even for stupid reasons, and most of the time when I have these dreams he ends up ignoring me and moving away. I have told him about these dreams and he just smiles and says "Since we don't argue on real life, we do it on dreams, it's better that way". I have had already these dreams around 8 times. I NEVER dream something beautiful with him. But this has nothing to do with our real relationship since it's almost perfect. So probably I am just worrying to much about the dreams or do they really mean something???

20090223082713AAxc1mT	Social Science;Psychology	Scared of friendships/relationships?	I'm scared of friendship and relationships - like whenever I get a chance at either I run away. If it's a person I really like and would love to be friends with, I can't stand to be around them. It's like I know it's never going to work or something. t's not shyness, it's almost fear (and not of rejection, but that I'll be accepted). I don't know what it is, but it stops me from getting anywhere in my life. Anyone else feel like this?

20090223061738AAEyXYF	Social Science;Psychology	I am depressed & feel like I can't live anymore?	I have struggle on and off with depression for years.  But I have been doing great since I completed a year of counseling.  I was feeling inspired and even started back to school.  But suddenly I feel horrible depressed again.  I don't even want to move.  I just want to sit in my room and give up on living.  I am dropping some of my courses today, because I just can't deal with it.  I am supposed to marry a wonderful man in a few months, but I don't have the energy to think about it.  I can't go to the doctor because I have no insurance or money.  I just want to curl up and die, and there is no good reason for this.  What can I do?
20090223110103AAxrMyR	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Does a guy have the right to grope you if you have sex with him?	We didn't even really have sex. I'm a virgin and I chickened out at the last minute. I said we should slow down, and were moving too fast. Never mind the fact that he tried to put it in anyway...      A few days later I was at his house and I was really tired. He's really touchy feely and is constantly pulling me towards him to kiss him or whatever. But that night when he pulled me toward him (we were standing) and I had made a joke about that night when I chickened out. He reached down and groped me...down there. I slapped his hand away, and he reached and did it again! And I slapped him away again! Told him to stop. A few minutes later, I said "we're supposed to be getting to know each other, you don't do that when you're getting to know someone." He then said "I didn't do that." And reached in AGAIN! I swatted his hand AGAIN and after that asked to be taken home.      I was really angry about it, and felt really uncomfortable. But I also feel like I may have given him the wrong message with that whole situation where I chickened out, and the joke I made about it. What do you think? We've explored the idea of dating since I met him about 3 months ago. But we've only really been dating for like 2.5 weeks.

20090223103231AAPrZjC	Social Science;Economics	Will US Democratic government print more dollar notes to overcome the economic crisis?	US$ is world currency; no alternative so far in the current situation, all the developed countries' economies were badly hit.   A lot of countries' reserve were held in US$, such as China. They don't hope US$ to depreciate.   If US$ devalue, its export will be more competitive which will hurt those export oriented countries, such as China and Asian countries.   The import will become more expensive, however US is the world engine of consumption and has more bargaining power. A lot of countries export to US. US people will only pay the import with US$ notes and the import must be affordable to them, so that they can spend more and more....    Printing dollar notes should be easier than selling debt to China government.

20090223110659AA20iOo	Social Science;Psychology	Resenting watching this girl's children?	Okay, I will try to make a long story short. I have a small home daycare. A girl who goes to my church and is married to the pastor's son who happens to be my husband's friend asked me to watch her child. I have learned over time that this girl is quite selfish, manipulative, and the world revolves around her. Its been one pain after another. I am a pushover and a people pleaser. Its not a good combination. I am watching her 2 children at half the rate of the other children. This happened because initially, her one child was coming for a very short day. She told me she was pregnant and asked if I could save a spot for the future baby. I didn't mind since I didnt' watch too many children. Anyways, I am now watching her 2 children for the price of one and they are coming long days, but only coming every other week (She is working full time now, 4 12 hour days, and one 16 hour day, and then 5 days off). So, she is working full time with benefits, and basically paying a quarter of what the other parents pay per child a month. She's also a picky parent, and has a lot of requests, complaints, etc. I have had to stand up to her a few times and draw the line, but I still resent watching her children. I feel sort of trapped because I agreed to do this on these terms. If it was some stranger, I would easily write up some new terms, etc. Now, they are going through a lot, her husband had mono, and a liver problem and ended up in the hospital, and she is struggling to make it at the moment. She dropped off the kids to me today on her week off so she could run errands and I'm just full of anger. I had looked forward to having a break this week. What is a healthy way to get rid of this anger, and get some control without totally going off on people who are going through a bad time!
20090223111329AA6ANK0	Social Science;Psychology	I think I have a serious lying problem?	Before I say anything, do NOT say 'you're probably lying right now.' I am not, this is a serious post for me, please don't mock it. Okay.   Ever since I can remember, I'd tell little white lies that I knew I could get away with. I'd exaggerate stories to interest people more, even when I knew I shouldn't. I felt like I couldn't stop myself.   Also, it's gotten worse lately. Last night I decided that I didn't feel like going to school today, so I told everyone I was talking to, even my friends who I didn't need to lie to, that I threw up. I went downstairs and made my mom believe it too. I thought about it so much that I started to convince myself that it was true.   What is wrong with me??
