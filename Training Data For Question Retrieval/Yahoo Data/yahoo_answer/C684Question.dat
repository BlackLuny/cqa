20090309120645AATw7ZC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Go Out With Him?	He went out with one of my best friend almost a year ago, they broke up because he fancied me, and since they have broken up he has been saying how he likes me and everything like that but only over text.    When we are at school he doesn’t really talk to me, he flirts with my friend that he broke up with, and she still likes him.   When we are out of school he is really sweet to me, and we flirt a lot, but when my friend is round us that he broke up with he wont flirt with me as much and flirt with her.    He has ask me out for about a year now over and over and I keep telling him I’m not sure because I keep telling him that I think he still has feelings for the other girl but he says that he doesn’t.   I really like him,   What should I do?    Should I go out with him?

We visit her a few times a yr since she lives 16hr a way with her mom. Every time we visit she wants to sleep with us in bedroom between her dad and me.  Of course we told her no and that she could sleep the bed next to us but not in the same bed. Her mom says what is wrong if she shares bed with us which is even worse.She freaks out every time her dad and I kiss or hug. She even told her mom that we had sex at hotel while she was staying with us which are not true.  Her mom and dad got divorced when she was 3yr and my husband and I have been married 3yrs and we have a 2yr old together. BTW she is taking Zoloft because her mom said she had behavior problems at school.

20090309121421AAXwNpY	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Whats going on with my ex?	We broke up b4 christmas and have had little to no contact since then. 3 weeks ago I wanted to know what the deal was so I texted him and he basically told me I should move on and that he can't see himself coming back right now or anytime soon. So I kindly asked for my things back that are at his apartment and he said right now? I said well obviously not right this second but yea soon. He said ok you'll get them. That was 3 weeks ago. He knows he can leave them for me outside his place when he goes to work bc hes done this before with my mail. I don't get it. If you wanted to move on with your life wouldn't you give your ex back her things so she would have no reason to be in contact with you anymore and you could just be done? So why hasn't that happened?

20090309121918AAxeWkV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?!!?! (female advice preferred) :P?	So here's the story. Yesterday me and my friend went to a movie and then afterwords went over to his gf's dorm to hang out for a little bit. It was me and him and his gf and like 4 other girls who were friends with her. I'm pretty outgoing and i was talking a good amount but i felt like me and her made some kind of connection. She was laughing at the things i said, talking to me a lot, and i felt like she was keeping eye contact a few times. After hanging out there for like 30 mins me and my friend were going to a beer pong tourney and we were gonna drop these girls off at a frat and when we walked out to the parking lot the girl i've been talking about said to me while i was walking to my car that it was nice to have met me. I also felt like we caught eachother looking at each other a bit after that.   Based her actions rather than the eye contact do you think she likes me?   ( i said to exclude the eye contact cuz maybe i was imagining it idk :P)         GIRLS HELP PLZ!               one of the main pieces of evidence i'd like you guys to consider would be how she said goodbye.      Well the hardest part about this too is that it would be hard to put myself in a position to hang out with this girl because it's my friends gfs friend. but as of late i've kinda gotten to become friends w/her cuz shes in one of my classes.   I'd feel awkward asking her if her friend likes me idk lol      anyways i invited this girl on facebook as a friend cuz there really wasnt another way i could get in a situation to talk to her, unless i asked my friend. she accepts my friend request on facebook and i message her and heres what is said:   me:i hope you don't think it's a weird thing that i invited you as a friend on facebook haha   her:haha no not at all it was really nice meeting u!   me:ya i thought u were a really nice person!   her:thanks so were you!..how was the rest of ur weekend?      then i started talking to her on facebook messenger since she was on so here's what was said there:   Matt      hey i can see that ur at your computer      lol   7:37pmAdrianna      yeah we have lessons right now      what r u up to?   7:37pmMatt      lessons?      i went back home on sunday morning      me and nick went to my friends appartment for a party but i didnt drink      so when i got back home i wasnt tired for some reason and wasnt tired enough to go to sleep ANDdddd couldnt pass out cuz i wasnt drunk :P:P so i just drove home to indy at 6 am since i was still up haha      sry for the book   7:40pmAdrianna      haha no worries about the book   7:40pmMatt      i talk a lot   7:41pmAdrianna      me too..i think thats a good thing that means u can have good conversations   7:41pmMatt      i love conversations!   7:41pmAdrianna      haha :):)      good   7:42pmMatt      in fact this weekend i had a revelation to minor or double major in philosophy   7:43pmAdrianna      u should! philosophy is really interesting   7:43pmMatt      not cuz its really relevant to being a lawyer but because it'd be fun      is that your major?   7:43pmAdrianna      no      bio and sociology with a minor in chem..im doing pre-med   7:44pmMatt      i've never taken a philosophy class before but i love talking about deep stuff      i was gonna do pre-med      my moms a nurse   7:44pmAdrianna      not a lot of guys say that..thats cool   7:45pmMatt      i'm definitely my own person lol      i mean i did just drive back at like 6:50 or 7 am on sunday morning cuz i couldnt sleep plus cuz i thought it'd be fun to drive with the windows down and see the sunset since it was warm enough for that      haha      i mean sunrise*   7:51pmMatt      i'm odd      hehe   7:53pmAdrianna      i bet its so pretty outside   7:53pmMatt      ya it has been for the last few days   7:53pmAdrianna      i am sorry that i am not talking very much   7:53pmMatt      today there was tornado warnings all across the state      its ok   7:53pmAdrianna      i am not supposed to really be on my computer right now      but i do talk a lot i swear...i will get on a facebook in a little i have to get off my computer i am sorry have a great night!   7:54pmMatt      okie dokie
20090309122404AA0eLoT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this relationship with my ex have a chance? Or is this going nowhere?	I met my ex-boyfriend in August 2006 in college. We started dating that October. I really fell for him. He had all the qualities I was looking for in a guy. Only thing was, I had just gotten out of a "relationship" and so I wasn't really ready to pour my heart out again. I liked my ex so much that it was hard to express my true feelings so I was kinda nonchalant about the relationship. Anyway, in September of 2007, he started ignoring my calls for about a week until I finally got an answer. He said he was ignoring me because he didn't trust me. Also, he said that I didn't care about him and I didn't show him that I liked him. I guess he was kinda right, but he didn't understand that this was just my immaturity. We ended up having a bad break up. I didn't wanna let him go. But he wanted to end things. We went months without speaking until recently. We didn't talk from November 2007 until the beginning of this year (January 2009). We gradually started talking to each other and now we hang out all the time, just like when we were together. He even came out of town with me and my family. And we also talk about the future. Of course I still like him, but I'm not sure what this means. He has never mentioned our past or when we broke up. Should I just play it by ear? Should I assume that he wants to work things out? Or is he just hanging out with me as a friend?
20090309121902AA0KdzU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this was meaningless to him?	OKAY so I've liked this guy for a long time, and I've always wondered if he liked me or not..because he acts like it, but I've never been sure..cuz we've always just been friends/aquaintances, but it seems like there's a lot of chemistry between us.      Anyway.      So we got drunk at this party, but the alcohol didn't really change anything, cuz we were flirting just like we always do, only moreso.  Apparently according to everyone else he was pointing me out more than usual.      So......then..we kinda hooked up the whole night and slept holding eachother and talking and..it was really nice...but..he kept saying how drunk he was, and just saying things like he was trying to convince me that's the only reason why it was happening..      But, he wasn't that drunk..and I think he was just using that as an excuse, because he's usually an emotionally detached person, as am I. So I was doing the same thing.      So we basically both were convincing eachother that it meant nothing because we were drunk.      But the problem is, I really like him, which is rare for me, and I didn't wana say anything then because I didn't want to scare him away.      I'm really confused..because even though we were drunk, we were acting the same towards eachother the whole night only to a higher extent...and plus the physical aspect was added.       Blah. I don't know. I don't just hook up with people randomly, I actually have to like them...And I've always liked him, but I don't know what the hell he's thinking. My first thought is "Wow, I got used. Duhh cmon now." But then I'm really confused how he acted like he likes me and stuff confuses me...and he could've hooked up with anyone else there...      Then why did he wana convince me that he was HELLLLA drunk, when he clearly was not?      I don't know. What do you guys think?

So this morning the boyfriend called me at 6:50, I needed to wake up at 7:20 to get ready and he was checking in to see how I felt because the days before he noticed I was sick and the morning before I also again had no voice. So after that he let me go back to bed, mom came in and I told her "I have no voice, have a presentation today, can't present with no voice and I just wanna stay home and rest" She got mad at that and told me "YOU'RE BOYFRIEND ISN'T COMING OVER TODAY, YOU'RE NOT GOING THERE AND YOU'RE NOT TALKING ON THE PHONE TO HIM TODAY AT ALL!" Well that'd be okay but I really wanna see him and he was going to bring me some tea today and try to make me feel better. How can I maybe convince my stubborn parents ( dad said same thing as mom ) to let my boyfriend come over? He's suspended so I can't see him at school till wed/thur and we only getta see each other for like 10 minutes for the whole school day.

20090227150918AAxaGBr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Overbearing stepmother?	I became a stepmother to a young girl several years ago, when she was 5. I had children of my own when she was 7 (twins). For the first two years, it was great. We still get along great but she told me the other day that she thinks I am way too overbearing on her and that I have been this way since she was 7, when her siblings were born. I have a maternal instinct by nature- even when I was a kid, people told me they knew I'd grow up to be a mom. Anyway, she named several examples of things that I did that were overbearing (and I admit they were). They included a) an incident from a few days ago when I saw some really red meat on her plate and took it to the microwave to heat it up. I know she's 20 but my maternal instinct kicked in and I just couldn't help myself. b) I always tell her to put her headlights on when she's driving, only for her to retort "I know!". c) I always tell her to drive carefully. I get the same retort from her. d) I ask her if she took her medicine when she's with us. I know, she's 20 and I need to stop asking that, but we still pay for her medical bills, so on the other hand I felt as though I'm entitled to know, but I know I need to stop asking. e) Even if she's just driving back to her mom's or to college I still like her to send us a call or text letting us know she got there safely. I know, my parents don't ask me to do this and I'm grown, so I need to back off here too. When we talked about my "overbearing-ness" she was understandably annoyed, and I apologized. The problem is that she told her mother about the incident with the red meat and her mother called me up and chewed me out, and told me to "f**k off and out of her daughter's life." I can understand the mom's being mad at me but I think she crossed the line with the "f" word (which she repeated several times). My husband and I talked about this, and he called the mom back and told her that I made a mistake by being overbearing but that she should be glad I love her daughter and to not speak like that to me. I'm not mad at my stepdaughter- she has the right to tell her mother things, but I'd also like to respectfully ask her to keep conversations between her and myself private. However, I want to phrase my request in a way that won't hurt her feelings about her mom. I know that I'm overbearing, but did the mom cross the line in her remarks to me, do you think? What do you think of my husband's response?

20090309132401AAnAKyz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Plz tell me what should happen here?	i know this doesn't fit the category, but i'm posting because my girlfriend told me to. basically, i feel like an idiot because i cheated on her and we've been dating for more than a year (big deal because we're both 18). she just found out and is really hurt, and we're trying to find a way to stay together. she is still really pissed at me, obviously, and we both know i made a mistake and don't wanna break up. i told her i was really sorry and that i would do anything to keep her. she asked me to do some stuff for her, and then asked if i would let her kick me in the balls. i said i didn't know about that, so she told me to write this---and get your opinions. should i take the kick(s)? if so, how many times and how hard should she do it? plz keep in mind how sensitive guys balls are :-/

20090227151601AA4yjAY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't figure out why he would lie or was he just caught off guard?	There's this guy that I've had a crush on. Mind you, I came to the conclusion he doesn't feel the same way about me. We have kept our friendship going, yet sometimes I feel that he finds it necessary to lie to me about people he dates. A few years ago I asked him if he was dating someone, he said no. Turns out...he was dating someone. When I asked him why he felt he had to lie to me, he said it wasn't what I thought. That they had already broken up. I told him he didn't have to be afraid to tell me he was dating any one. I wasn't going to do or say anything. *shurgs*   Recently, I was with him and we were on the internet and we came across an email on his Myspace page, which is a business page for him. It was something a girl, he knows, wrote to him? I asked him if he was dating her and he said no. The message the girl left was rather short, but personal. He said he didn't know why she wrote it or what she meant by it. I told him again, he didn't have to lie to me, that if he was dating someone that was fine. He got mad at me, which began an argument between us. He then said he and I would never go date because we don't get a long. Then he accused me of being jealous. I was dumbfounded by the whole turn of events. It went from one direction to another. Why did he get so angry with me? I've tried talking to him since then, (we've made up.) Yet he doesn't want to talk to me about it. What do you think is up with him?
20090227152404AA3yeM2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you and your spouse have kids from previous marriages?	Do love your spouse's children as much as you love your own and vice versa? Did you join the relationship when your spouse's children were still very young or older?  Are you step children fond of you?       Not that I am looking or anything, but I feel like it would be difficult to find someone out there that would ever accept everything and everyone in my life. Also, I don't know if I would ever trust another individual with my kids.

He asked if I really don't believe in love or marriage and I told him I do but I'm just pessimistic about it and I don't wanna get hurt.  So he said he feels like I don't take our relationship seriously and he thinks I'm gonna hurt him.  Later today he said he was just being silly.  But should I worry that he's just gonna leave?

20090227152903AA63W95	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it wrong for me ask him for money?	I have a crush on this guy at work. We always flirt and joke around about sexual staff. I told him that I am good at giving bjs so he wants me to perform on him.      I am willing to do it since I already have a crush but I want him to pay me for doing it since we are not doing.      So is it wrong for me to charge him?
20090227152155AA9Hxrc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I can't handle rejection & he knows it - so he says I can't contact him again -Help?	He wants money, if I don't give it in 2 days I can't be with him anymore. He won't even talk about it because he doesn't need me & I feel like i'm dying without him.     I don't know how to get through this.  Have ended up in hospital before because I can't move on like others.  He won't talk to me unless I give in & my stomach is in knots.  He sent one text to say pay up or don't ever bother me EVER again.        Yet we were ok earlier.  People told me b4 he was nice, so I feel it's my fault that he is demanding from me

20090227152906AAt5nTu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she flirting with him!?	Somehow, this chick that thinks she's my friend found out that I like a guy named Jonah. In P.E. today, she was flirting with him hardcore! She never ever EVER talked to him before, but as soon as that skankin' *** ***** found out that I LIKED HIM, she does. Why? What did I ever do to her? Seriously, it makes me mad. You can tell that he doesn't like her at all, but seriously, come on, why does she have to flirt with HIM?!      P.S. Yesterday at lunch she said she would never like someone shorter than her, and he's way shorter than her.       P.P.S. Also if it matters, we're in 8th grade.

So, there's this guy that I have not talked to yet, but I want to(I'm too scared, don't suggest I talk to him, please). Well, at the end of the school day, he usually walks and finds his brother.

20090227152345AAmUDKK	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends totally embarrassed me...?	Ok, so I already sort of expected that this guy I liked knew I liked him (but he does not know me that well, and definetly does not like me back.) and I stupidly told two of my friends who I liked and made them promise not to tell anyone. The bad part is, that guy I like is in our class, and he came over to my table. They kept whispering my name and averting their eyes to him like I didn't notice he was there. It's not like he doesn't sit right in front of me, anyway! Now I'm sure he thinks that something is up, and they totally embarrassed me! What should I do?
20090227151609AAhUBlm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband says i care TOO much about him more than myself... what do i do?	Well my husband says that i care about him TOO MUCH and worry about him.      Yes, i do admit i am over protective, care and love him very dearly. Currently as he is experiencing hardship and depression i have very much wanted him to feel my presence in knowing I am there for him and will support him.       But recently we have been bashing heads as he has become distant, maybe i have not given him that space to adjust or heal. I do not know if my caring nature has come across as clingy, needy or too attached.      But now i feel like everything i do is wrong and now with him saying this and my friends agreeing with my nature being too caring. I do not know how to go about my nature.      QUESTION:   Do i sustain myself and undergo the changes by husband stated of being too caring and worrying too much. By focusing three weeks on myself with limited interaction with him?      HELP...WHAT SHOULD I DO...I THANK ALL FOR ANSWERING AND DIVORCE IS NOT AN OPTION I WILL THINK OR WILL TAKE AS A SOLUTION TO THIS MATTER. SO THOSE WHO ANSWER THIS WILL BE DISMISSED.

20090227152322AAC4Ez8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How  would you respond?	I am 53 yrs old. I am mostly bedridden from many chronid illnesses. I get very little money on ssid necause I was a stay at home mom for yrs. I have grown children in their 30;s. both married, One is struggling in this ecomomy,the other is not. The cone that is not takes a couple vacations a yr to Mexico for 5 weeks at a time. they also take other vacations throughout the yr. I only bring this up to show they have no money problems. I do not get enough money to survive. I need help. Sometimes I need help with electric bill. I have thought if letting electricity to be turned off,but I need it for my breathing machine,nebuliser,hospital bed,etc. My son said he would never pay my ele. bill ever so don't ask. He yells at me almost everytime I ask for something, It coulld asking for toliet paper,food,whatever the need it. Now,he is changing from yelling to harshly saying he will not do this or that. I am all alone. I know noone because I am homebound and severely sick. I have heart,lungs,nuerological deseases and much more. I really wish I had enough money to survive. but around $8,000 a yr is just not enough. even though I live in low income housing it still takes most my money up just for rent. My sone thinks I have extra money after bills are paid. He forgets about things like I need poise, shampoo, face and hand cream,and all those daily basics. Plus I need medical things my insurance doesn't cover.   It is very stressful being treated like dirt. I haave bleeding in my intestines now and my doctor says it is from stress. It is from all the unloving and unhelp things son does. Now, in his favor he does do somethings for me. But if I ask for more he accuses me of thinking he is not enough. To me that is not the issue. I am so poor that if I go get some food from a church,doesn't mean I don't have other needs such as medical needs I need. I literally have been calling places in 2 different states for the past yr. for help/assistance with things. Because I need help and I do not want to ask family for help. But so far,after about 400 phone calls, there is no help. I went through a stage of being shocked and in despair because I just thought there was help out there somewhere.But there is not for me. IF I was younger their is more help. IF I was older there is more help..I seem to fall through the craacks.    If I has a car I would sleep in it to save up my monthly checks to get the things I need.not want.need.   I am so sad that I am treated like a burden. I do not want to be a buden. For me needing food or help medically should not be looked at as a burden from your own children....especaily is you make 6 figures. Son tells me how broke he is, as I see him putting up a new plazma tv on the wall, and buying the latest gagets. He even looked through my garbage a lttle after xmas and found a reciept for under $10,00 for a bracelet.and uses that as an excuse not to give me money. That bracelet was a gift from my friend. He is impossible to deal with. What would you do?
20090227154152AAvALzg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel like I can't trust guys...?	Every time someone takes an interest in me i feel likes its only because they want to hook up with me and i don't want that. And its not just random fears because its happened to me before. like 3 times. and I know that i shouldn't base every guy on a few but how am I supposed to trust a guy when he takes an interest in me?

20090309135241AAPcWQ7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I learn to accept love?	I know that there are people who love me. My brain tells me that it's obvious that people love me because they act like it and they tell me so.    Yet I feel, deep down, that no one loves me and I'm alone.      How do I change this?
20090227152508AAycLHk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i let him finger me?	my boyfriend has been begging me to let him finger me.    i mean begging!    i am gonna let him do it but i just do really know if i should.    he says he'll be gentle and that i will really love it but i don't know cuz i've never had it done before.    he thinks that i should blow him first and then let him finger me but i don't really know.    he also wants to fist me.    haha. what is that?    i would just like to know if i should let him do it?
20090227153402AAXAuYD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This may seem like a small problem but.....?	to me its huge. My boyfriend is a good man, and has never treated me badly in the 2.5 years we've been together. However, there is one big problem which has come up now and then, yet he never seems to accept where hes going wrong. I'm not sure if I am willing to spend any more time in this relationship. From the very beginning, he was never very generous with money (even though he earns a good wage). I was the opposite - would pay half and sometimes more than my fair share. Its not that he won't pay, more like he'll pay begrudgingly. If he thinks that I will pay the full bill in a restaurant, then he'll hang back and wait for me to do so. If I decide that its his turn to pay, he'll wait until the very last second to take his wallet out, when he realises that I'm not making an effort to do so. If I decide that we're both paying half, I will take my share out and he takes it straight away. If he offers his half to me on other occasions, I take it straight away too, because I've realised over our time together that hes not very giving. (I used to push his half away, and as a result ended up paying for more than he ever did at the start of the relationship because its in my nature to be generous. I feel that he would've gladly let me carry on doing this until I saw the light.) Hes a good person in every other way, but I fear that this will be our downfall in later years, because I don't think he will ever share willingly - it almost seems like he shares because hes pushed into it. What are your views?

I told him I liked him, he said he kind of liked me too and that I was a nice person but that we don't spend enough time together. We've made plans to do things now.

But.. sometimes he doesn't notice me. Like as if i didn't exist.   Other times he looks at me and then looks away, and looks at the ground.      Why ?? It's confusing me so much! Sometimes it's like he is interested in me, but then sometimes he doesn't even see me!      By the way, I dont know him, at all      btw we both get labeled as "scene" whatever the heck that is.. like Oh that girl is scene, yeah, he's a scene guy... get what i mean?
20090227151211AA1wMIx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife wants to talk to the other woman...?	Alright, About a year ago I was involved in an affair with a married man (please no mean comments, I know it was wrong and do regret it). It was a sex only relationship nothing more (neither of us wanted anything more than that), we worked together so it was easy to hide as we had to spend alot of time together alone at work. He did recently decide to tell his wife everything, all she really wants to know is why it happened, and he has given her his side, but she wants to talk to me?!?! I don't know if I should, and if I do what i should say! (again, please no lectures.) I know this part sounds selfish, but I am really worried that she will get out around town now, and wonder if talking to her or not talking to her might prevent this! I don't know! help!   Thank you!

20090227154003AAFTrWX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I going about this the wrong way?	My guy friend has been giving me the cold shoulder since he found out that I liked him. We were good friends before, but now he has been ignoring me. A few weeks ago he said we should take time off eachother and focus on other stuff. I asked him a few days ago if we were okay, and he said he wasn't really, and he was still awkward. I guess I could see it coming, but it hurts, because I really liked him, and he just started ignoring me. I miss him, and I want to jsut go back to being strictly friends again. I have tried a few times to be friendly, but I either becme to scared or he doesn't acknowledge me. So far, I have tried to keep my thoughts silent, but I occasionally put in little MSN statuses and facebook statuses that kind of reflect how I'm feeling. I know this might be the wrong way to go, but I almost want him to realize how I feel; just very subtly, how I'm hurting. I had done this a before, whenhe first started ignoring me, and that was when he first talked to me and said we swhould take time off. he first asked if I was okay, and he knew I was frustrated, or something like that. I've given up on trying to be friendly to him anymore, because if he still feels awkward, nothing will make him be friends with me if he feels that way. I'm not sure if time will heal anything. Am I weak and a bit pathetic if I put those little random MSN messages and facebook statuses that show how I feel? I'm not like, completely obsessive or obvious, they are very subtle, and other than that I haven't been giving a clue about anything. It's like, I just want tos ee if he realizes how I feel, and if he cares at all about how I feel, as a friend. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

20090227151823AAvacIj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help Me!! There's this guy....?	There is this guy in my maths class and i really like him. He's not my usual type so i don't know why i do but i just do. I think that he likes me too and anyways, he used to just tease me and annoy me and turn everything i say into something wrong, but now we giggle together and he smiles at me and keeps eye contact and after school we chase each other round for some reason. I often catch him looking at me and we do this thing where I look at him and he looks at me and then i look away and then i look back and he's still looking at me and we smile at each other and keep eye contact for a few seconds and then we blush and look away. Does it sound like he likes me? I haven't told my girl best friends because they would just tell him and mess things up and I've only told one person, one of my closest guy friends who is like a brother to me. He said that he'd told the guy I liked subtly and he'd just blushed and nodded and then he started acting more friendly and flirty towards me. If I went out with him though my friends wouldn't like it because they don't really like him because he isn't very popular? What should I do? Does he even like me? I'm constantly thinking about him all the time it's crazy. We aren't exactly mates we just hang round together sometimes and tease each other in lessons and giggle. I saw him today and after class I said bye, hug and hugged him and his friend and he playfully told me to gerrof lol. When he was teasing me once I teased him back and he looked sad so I stroked his hand and went "aww you look so sad" and he just smiled at me. Bearing in mind we're both 13, what do I do?? HELP PLEASE!!

What percent chance this guy is interested? % chance he likes me as a just a friend?   and what are the clues that tell you that?      I meet new guy from school (friend of my brother's--my age). We make eye contact. (It could be just me, but I felt our eyes "lock".) I think he's cute so I get shy and quiet and don't say much. He smiles and is kind of quiet too. A few minutes later, he asks me a few random questions about myself. He responds positively to my answers. He teases me once but is mostly serious and quiet.      The next time at school, my friend and I run into him again. He smiles at me when we make eye contact. I joke with him and from then on it seemed like he was cracking jokes and smiling really big the entire time (he was picking on my brother in a good mannered way) and I was laughing at all his jokes. He seemed happy the entire time.

20090227153443AAMFht9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Taking advantage of my girlfriend?	Ok so me and my girlfriends have been together for 4 to 5 months now and she told me that she has enough trust in me to not care if i went in her shirt. This came up because she was trying to keep her license from me because she was embarrassed of the picture on it. So she put it up her shirt and I said "Do you really think that will stop me from getting it" One thing led to another and she said she trusted me enough to not care if i did or not. But she also said that as long as i don't take advantage of her trusting me so much she wont care. But the way I feel it think im taking advantage no matter what i do. I don't want her to think im taking advantage of her or anything. So my question is what should i do so that she doesn't think im taking advantage but instead just trying to show her how much i care?
20090227153612AAkf5pg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i keep trying with this girl i like?	There's a girl in my class that i like. She knows how i feel, but likes one of our friends. She says she really wants to be friends, but sometimes she flirts with me a little bit still (i think). I think she may like me a little still, so should i keep trying to go after her? And would it be weird to text her just saying hello and checking on her day?

She doesn't want her son to go back to his fathers house.. he is not even 10 years old.. but the court order from her divorce years ago gave the father every other week-end.   The problem is..

It will cost 3grand for her to get a lawyer but she doesn't have that much money... What can she do?  I've suggested that she move .. but that's not going to do anything.   Any advice?
20090309140059AAz8tWs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm reeally worried aout my friend!! Please help?!?	My best friend split up with her boyfriend last month, a good move as he was making her unhappy, but as a way of getting over it, she's been sleeping around quite a bit. She's absolutley gorgeous and could have anyone she wanted, but just goes to parties, gets really drunk and gets with anyone. I've told her this, and asked her why she's doing it, to which she just replied 'I just like having sex, and as long as people don't find out about it I wont be called a ****'. I mean obviously I'd never say anything, but these things do get out and I'm just worried aout her.. she's also been really obsessing over her appearance and can't seem to talk about anything else. This just isn't like her, she's one of the least superficial people I've ever met and this change in personality is quite a shock. What can I do to make help her?      She also told me that she doesn't use condoms a lot of the time either, because shes on the pill...    I dont want her to regret anthing later, but shes so stubborn- it's impossible to rationalise with her!

20090309141323AALHiA4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do girls completely ditch their mates as soon as they've got a boyfriend?	after listening and being there for my best mate for the last few years throughtout every minor problem she's had. (she left uni and lives a couple of hours away but we used to speak everyday 4 about 2hours). she was there for me too and we were so ridiculously close, we told each other everything... Then she started going out with this guy and i havent heard from her in 5 months. before then it was always me ringing her so i just thought i'd leave it and see how long it would take her to ring me. so far after 5 months, nothing. so why do girls do this? i understand when u fall in love u want to be with them all the time but is it really worth losing a best friend.
20090309144812AAPFcqW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Best way to say I am not in love with you?	I have been married and divorced and so has the man I have been dating. A man who, was deceptive about the number of times he was married.      He believes that this can be overlooked and that I will "get over it".    I am not getting over with it.   He on the other side is saying "we are so much in love" and wants to move in with me and our lives together will be so great.   I have tried to tell him, I am not over this and I am not sure about our relationship.    I am thinking after a month of not being able to "get over it" maybe I need to end the relationship.   He is kind in other ways - but he lost his job and I think he believes he can move right in and things will be great.  I don't agree and he isn't listening.... I don't want to hurt him - but I don't think my feelings are as strong as his are for me.  How do I tell him?    Last time I tried breaking up with him - he cried.....

20090309145950AABnoUv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going on inside his head? Confused much?	I like this guy, i see him in college every so often. We started texting and talking to each other more, and last week i asked if he liked me (he was flirting with me a lot). He said "I shouldn't do, but im starting to". I'm currently on a break with my boyfriend because we have been arguing a lot, and since then i have fallen for this guy (though that wasn't supposed to happen, hence why he said "i shouldn't do").   That was a week ago. This last week has been really confusing, because one minute he is flirting with me, and the next he is taking it back.   For example,   the other night i said i was bored on facebook and said i wanted someone to take me out. Me and my friends started talking and then the guy who i like joined the conversation. He started acting like he wanted to come out with us, so i said "well if you wanted to join our possy so badly all as you needed to do was say :). Where are we all off then?" and he was like "i dno, after ive finished watching harry hill though :)"      Anyway it got late so i went on msn and said to him "looks like we're not going out tonight then, guess we'll have to go out tomorrow!"   and he said "Ah well, have fun"      which left me very confused because i thought he wanted to go out...   then he said, "guess i'll be watching these DVD's i bought today on my own then" and i said "i'll watch them with you :)" and he said "what, now?" and i said "noo, but you won't be watching them all tonight!"   anyway abit later he said "im going watching cloverfield", so i said "and save a dvd to watch with me!" and he just went "erm, yeahh, sure."         what the hell? one minute he is incinuating that he wants someone (i.e me) to watch his dvds with him, and the next he is acting like that :s      could it be because ive not officially broken up with my boyfriend and he's jealous?   i know that he must like me abit coz he was also saying things like "aw its ok baby :). Oh wait, sorry, i forgot i can't say things like that, coz' you have a boyfriend."      why make things confusing? What is he trying to do :s?

But other times she's just staring at the dinner table and what we are eating. She is super sweet, loyal, and lot's of fun. I feel like I'm always getting mixed signals from her. Sometimes we go walking in the park together and we usually have a good time, but last time she barely payed attention to me and was staring at the some of the studs walking in the park. And It really bothers me... then she thinks she can just lick my hands and that is supposed to make everything all better??????
20090309145959AAC6YxP	Family & Relationships;Family	Do You Agree With Oprah?	When I use to work at a womens shelter, unfortunately some women chose to run back home to their husband or /b/f because of "love".   Only to come back later on under the same circumstances.   But I think Oprah paints with too broad of a brush.   What about men (and women) who I've seen that have gotten help for their anger and abuse problems.   And why is it just men?    I've seen that were raised never to strike a woman, so their wife or g/f took advantage of the situation.   IMHO, to say what she said is as ignorant as making a stereotypical perception about African Americans.
20090309150640AAia8Dj	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend told me his friend likes my behind and now keeps making fun of me?	Last friday, my friend (let's call him A) said to me that our other friend (we'll call him B) thinks I have a nice behind. Ok. I didn't really care because people are entitled to their own preferences. But the thing that really ticked me off is that all through the weekend, when A and I were talking online, he kept on annoying me and laughing about how B likes my butt. I told him to stop because it was kind of embarrassing so he stopped. For the day. Then when we went back to school today, A just went right on about how my behind and was like, "before I couldn't tell, but now I can!" and he kept making perverted remarks about it in the middle of class. It's so flipping annoying and it really makes me want to just like punch him or something. He wasn't like this last year when we were still in middle school. What do I do?!

20090309144708AACLGzR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did he react this way and go off on me?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      Since then he has been distant and ignorning me when I text him so yesterday I gave him a hard time about ignoring me I was just trying to be silly and he responded and said "What do you mean ignorning you? And last I checked your husband was "name"      What is up with him? I don't understand why he is being so hard on me and doesn't seem to want to be my friend?

She gave me her cell number, and wants to hang out JUST AS FRIENDS, but when I ask her to hang out, she keeps coming up with stuff to avoid hanging out. for instance last friday we were gonna hang out but her girlfriend (shes gay) left her for someone else and she wanted to be alone. and then 4 days later her mom lost her job, so she said she couldnt hang out cuz she needed to be with her family cuz she feels bad for her mom. thats a lot to take in 4 days. after telling me that, she blocked me on facebook, so i cant contact her. After finding out she blocked me, i texted her and called her and she ignored them all. my theory is that she just has too much going on, like too much drama and doesnt need me talking to her, asking her to hang out, cuz she said she feels bad when she blows me off like last week with her girlfriend leaving her. I then told her if she doesnt want to hang out with me, then she could just tell me. i've told her this numerous times and she keeps saying that she didnt say that, meaning she would want to hang out. plus she suggested we hang out and promised she'll make up for the time she blew me off last week. i just think she needs space for a little while. since she blocked me, i havent been talking to her, i havent texted her for like four days since she blocked me. i then texted her asking how shes doing and that im sorry for putting pressure on her to hang out... no reply. I'm now going to call her on thursday and if she doesnt answer im going to, on Sunday, go to the mall where she works, which is an hour away from my house, go in the store she works at (journeys), say hi and ask if its cool if we talk on her lunch break. And so i dont sound desperate, I will tell her was at a friends house around here and decided to swing by to run some errands and see how shes doing. does that sound like a good move, and one that she will appreciate/welcome??    thanks! =)=)=)

20090309140728AALoWiA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Relationship advice, help?!?	I'm not actually in a relationship. Rather a really strong friendship.    We constantly think about each other and miss each other when the other isn't there. We have so much in common and we clicked as soon as met one another.   I've never had a man treat me with so much respect before, he's such a gentlemen and always does nice little gestures like buy me roses and send really cute text messages. And we constantly tell each other we love each other in a friendshipy way. We ended up properly making out not long ago and he treated me and me so preciously and selflessly and touched me so tenderly.    I feel so comfortable and at ease with him and he's such a good person - doesn't drink, smoke, go clubbing and he's really family oriented. Personality wise he's all I've ever looked for in a man and I never thought I'd find it. And we talk for hours and hours on the phone at night and we have such a laugh. He's the type of person you'd be proud to introduce your parents to. He's such a loving person who lives for people and making the world a better place. What we have is like something out of a movie but despite that I'm madly confused. Theres no chemistry whatsoever, no spark. I really wish there was because it's the only thing thats lacking.   I don't know whether inside I'm being really shallow and it's just his physical appearance putting me off. Looks have never carried much importance to me but now I'm starting wonder whether that is a matter of choice or whether they just do or don't.    Should I try to find the spark and chemistry or just give up and remain friends? He's a great person, very wealthy and from a lovely family. We always tell each other how we couldn't live without one another and we've both admitted we'd be slightly jealous if the other was to get into a relationship.   I'm really stuck on what to do! Pleaaaase help! :)
20090309141752AAlkS7q	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to get over loosing my best freind?	This is a bit long so please bear with me lol.      Me and my male best friend met during year 10 of secondary school, we became really close. Gradually he told me that he had feelings for me, I only saw him as my best friend and I told him it wasn't possible and that I didn't want to risk the good friendship we had. He didn't have a problem with it but he would always mention it again and again helplessly, I understood he couldn't help it but each time he did I just refused with the same reason. Then one day I couldn't take it anymore so I said a lot of horrible things to him and told him never to talk to me again.   I cut off all the ways he could communicate with me and stopped talking to him. I missed him a lot but I only did it because I really didn't want to hurt him even though this was another way I was hurting him but about 4 months later I couldn't take it; I missed him so I foolishly got through to him, apologized and he after a lot of talk said it was okay. But after that every time I talked to him he would say a lot of mean things because he was still very hurt so I again told him I wasn't going to take this from him and that maybe it wasn't a good idea to get back together in the first place; I told him I was truly sorry but if he was going to keep on saying things then I couldn't possibly carry on with him.      About 4 months passed again and this time it was his birthday; I still missed him and I wanted to wish him so I got through again! He replied straight away and told me he was sorry and that everything was to be back to normal.   We started talking again and everything went back to normal infact it went even better until one day he told me he really loved me and that he was willing to forget everything and start again if I was going to say yes. I couldn't believe it after everything I’d done he was still saying the same thing; I told him I would never go out with him as I only saw him as a friend and that I had a boyfriend anyway. He was heart broken yet again and this time he said that he'd forget about it and just wait which annoyed me but he said to give him time and eventually it went back to normal.      I broke up with my man about a month later and now everything was fine with me and my best friend, we'd see each other every week we weren’t having any arguments although he was a little over-protective. Then he told me he was going out with a girl, I didn’t have a problem with it but I was a little bit jealous as I wasn’t used to it. I didn’t say anything to him because it wasn’t such a big issue. Soon she broke up with him and he was really hurt I was there for him until he became his normal self again. (this took a while)      Then he met another girl who he described as perfect; I was happy for him until he started to change. He started ignoring me and any conversation we had now involved talks about only her. I didn’t mind at first because I knew that there was a time when I did the same thing and I talked to him about it a few times so that he would realize what he was doing but every time I told him we ended up having arguments. So I tried to let things get back to normal. It didn’t I started missing the old him a lot but no matter what I said to him he just didn’t want to know; he would say it was all to do with me which infuriated me so much I started hating the girl he had now started to like. He thought I was jealous when infact I was angry that because of her I was having an argument everyday with my best friend.      He became so unbearable I did the last mistake. I called his houseline which I shouldn’t have and I swore at him endlessly I told him how I hated him and more horrible things. We ended it there. He has never contacted me after that to explain himself; I’ve heard he’s really happy with his new girl and that I am like I was never there.      I cant get over the fact that we fell out over a girl, I tried to contact him even though I was the one who told him to get lost but he ignored it. What am I mean to do and can any one get me to see sense? Whether I'm wrong or not I want to know what you think!   Thanks :)
20090309145530AAN2iwJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy approach another girl when his girlfriend is with him?	I'm the other girl. I've made out with the guy before when his girlfriend wasn't in the country but he is not the kind of guy I want for a boyfriend. We only see each other in clubs and don't have contact outside of that.       The other night, I saw him out again with his gf and he tried to come up & talk to me after I'd waved at him to be polite. Why would he try to talk to me while his girlfriend is around?

20090309143525AAM5kPc	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm a shy guy & I went to a spa last week, what mental image is so hilarious about my story to people?	So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

20090309141307AArXGON	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best Friend Issues? Help Please?	ok, i was in a in and out relatioship with a best friend for the last 2 years, we never actually went out, but she told me that she was mine for a long time, and that if i had said something, we would have been going out that day, at the time i recided because she was going out with a very distant friend of mine, and i beleive i should always do the most honourable thing      things past by and we were still best mates, we are both 17 now, and she has a new boyfriend, hes 23, he has a house of his own, and a nice beamer, surfice to say, i'm out of competition, i decided to come out with everything over the last year and a half, this is where we spoke about how we felt, she decided, after thinking it through, that she was going to stay with her boyfriend. Although she didn't actually tell me herself, she got a mutual friend to tell me. She said it was the hardest decision she had ever made.      naturally i accepted, i never expected her to even consider coming back with me, so i began repairing my self esteem and trying to push aside the feelings i had for her      after a while, it became nothing, it was bliss, she was out of my head, and she started texting me, shed send texts telling me she'd had dreams of falling asleep cuddling me, and she even declared that she felt like she was cheating on her boyfriend because she was thinking about me so much.      These texts soon became infectious, and i was back in a rut again, i felt confused as at times she would become quite cold, i asked her for answers as to where i stood 2 or 3 times, to which she stayed ever elusive, i waited, and waited, and decided that i would have to bring an end to it,      i sent her a message declairing that perhaps us not being together was propbably not for the best, and that i accepted her decision, and that i too beleived it to be the right one, this wasnt at all true though, i just needed to cut things off, and as i couldnt get an answer, i had to do it like this, if anything, for my mental health.      i asked that we still be friends, to which she seemed to accept, but now she ignores me, and dose things that she knows, (from being a best mate for so long) really really get to me.      Why is she being like this?      Why wouldn't she be straight with me, and tell me herself what her decision was?      i tryed to do the right thing, i really did      where do i go from here?      cheers x

20090309142440AAqWysO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I Don't Want To Be The FRIEND!!?	I'm starting to fall for one of my best friends. The only bad thing is that she has a boyfriend, that nobody really likes. She comes to me for almost everything and we hang out all the time. I don't know if she feels the same way but something tells me that me and her is right. I try so hard to control my emotions around her but there's not a day that goes by where thinking about her doesn't bring a smile to my face. I can't stop my heart from feeling this way and I know I can't say anything to her. What do I do??

He was touching my butt, telling me that i had a nice butt, putting his butt in my face lol, and telling me he wanted tongue, just kidding around, except when he was touching my butt, i still kinda like him , and i miss the way he use to do that but im not sure about my feelings because then the guy i had my first kiss with is now single and was when I came over, i had a lot of fun with him also, he was touching my butt too, but he has been known to be a cheater i never dated him and i don't really want to but i miss him just how we use to flirt, i don't want to seem a ****, its just i have no idea what to do.

20090309143006AA2UvZV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he doing this? =(?	Me and my boyfriend had an original plan that we wouldn't start dating until we'd both be ready, at first i was uncertain whether he liked me enough because i'm the one that kept suggesting we'd be together, even though he had a bad breakup before because he rushed into a relationship and it didn't work out because he's a workaholic, as in working 24/7 and was always under stress, he told me he wouldn't be able to commit to me or give me time, but somehow we got together anyways because we were so blinded by "love" and what he said started happening, fairly quickly, i started to expect things, last night he just told me he can't do this anymore, and i was so sure we were in love, he's telling me he doesnt want to do this or leave me and he's not doing this because he's looking for other women, he even "deactivated" his facebook to show me some sign of his faithfulness, and he said his definition of love is being able to stay apart and not letting anything change, for now, because he's under a lot of pressure and stress and is working so much he's not even going to school, should i believe him and stay faithful? I'm just really lost and confused! Do you think he just needs time and will be back? Is this just a break, or a break up? When i asked him if he loves me, he said i believe i do, and when i asked if he still wants to be with me, he said yes i do?

20090309145022AAX0ltq	Family & Relationships;Family	I don't feel loved from anyone?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

20090309151343AAOGGAc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this?	I have a close guy friend ; we've been friends for almost six months. We are just friends, nothing more. He is the second close guy friend I've had. (The first guy, I've been friends with for almost three years.) My parents took a long time to get used to the idea of my being friends with the first guy, even though they think he's a great guy. (When they found out, my mom flipped out, 'cause she thought that we were more than friends. My parents are pretty strict, even though I'm eighteen.) They've never met this newer friend, but I feel like I should tell them that I'm friends with him, before they see/hear anything, and make assumptions. So I'm hoping to talk to them about it soon.      When I told him that I'm planning to tell them about him, he thought I was taking things too far. When I explained that I didn't want to get in trouble for nothing, he basically said "You can tell your parents whatever you want. I've never met them, they've never met me, so I don't care what they think about me. I'm just concerned about what you think about me; I don't want you to get the wrong idea."      How should I deal with this?

20090309160108AAIHzsq	Family & Relationships;Friends	A former friend that I haven't spoken to in more than a year sent me a Myspace friend request. Should I accept?	This girl and I haven't seen/spoken to each other since about November 2007. We used to hang out together a lot, but by November 2007, our lives were busy and our schedules didn't coordinate anymore.      She was also on my Myspace friends list. Even though we hadn't seen/spoken to each other since November 2007, I had kept her on my Myspace. But I deleted her in April 2008, because I had sent her a Myspace e-mail a week prior but she didn't reply. She must've been mad at me, and that's probably why she never replied. I felt that she was just keeping me on her friends list as a trophy friend. So I deleted her.      Then yesterday morning, I logged into my Myspace and there was a friend request from her. She also sent me an e-mail with just the words "How are you?" and "I miss you a lot."      So, should I re-add her after all this time? It's been 11 months since I deleted her from my Myspace. I miss the good times we had as friends, but I don't really miss her. And why would she let so much time go by before attempting to contact me? I get the feeling that she's just lonely or probably got into a fight with her boyfriend. That's probably why she decided to contact me after all this time.

My style is cute-casual - so jeans, checked shirts, teeshirts, cute dresses, that sort of stuff but for parties, like oversized tees with wet look leggings, or cute dresses, that sort of stuff. I always look well put-together but not overdone and I'm told I've got a cute face (by people on Y!A as well as real life btw). SO is this okay for guys? And do guys find this look attractive?

20090309152533AAC6YBs	Family & Relationships;Family	I don't even know what's right and wrong anymore? How should I tell her?	This is very long. If you have the time, I very much appreciate a legit answer.      Background issue in a nutshell:   I'm having medical issues.   My mother hit the side of my head until my nose bled.    It may be possible she's affected those medical issues.      Problem at hand:   I'm going to be bringing up the fact that I think her hitting me should be brought up to the doctor soon.   She's been in both good and bad moods throughout these past couple of weeks.   I've been sort of detching from her for two reasons-   1. I just don't feel 100% comfortable around her.   2. Every so often, she'll go out shopping or something and ask me if I want anything or want to go with her. I say no, because I'd feel like a jerk of a person to accept all of these nice offers from her and then suddenly turn around and say, "Oh, yeah. By the way. I've been thinking about turning you in."      Thing is, she is frustrated and upset and angry with me because I barely talk with her or any of my family anymore.   She puts up a very defensive front when talking to me and her anger boils, but when she's by herself, I can tell she's been crying. I feel bad, because I don't want to make her cry. I feel like a jerk for upsetting her, but like I said, I'd feel like an even bigger jerk for being nice to her and then turning on her.      My parents very often like to remind me of all the things they do well for me, so I highly doubt they'd appreciate me going off and telling people that they've hit me.    They don't appreciate me being quiet, either. I don't completely ignore them. I answer their questions if asked and what not, but I don't really make an effort to start conversation.      I'd get this issue out with them ASAP, but there are guests coming to visit tomorrow, and I don't know if there is a certain day they'd leave. I don't want to make a huge deal with my parents before/while the guests are here.   Either way, the time to tell them must be soon, because I am going to see a Neurologist next week.      Any ideas on how to handle my mother and father before those guests come over? While they're over? This has been going on for a while, and they are starting to question me. What can I say to them in the meantime?    I've thus for told them that I simply don't feel well - which is true, in part - but they're not buying it. I don't think I'm doing the right thing waiting so long, but I just want to be able to hold it out until these guests leave. I don't really want to fuel their anger and frustration.

20090309151713AAQO4zf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you feel like love changes the longer you've been married?	Maybe this seems cliche but... my husband and I have been together for 6 years and we have a Beautiful 7 month old daughter. I love him so much but it feels like the love is more like respect and admiration. It's not that fiery passionate love we had when we first fell in love. The dynamics of our relationship changed when we had a baby. Not in a bad way, I am just tired and snippy and I don't take the time to snuggle him like I used to. My love for him is different now, he's the father to my child and he is a wonderful provider. I don't see him much because he works all the time. It's not like fireworks going off when he walks in the room. lol It's just the same thing. "How was your day?" followed by small talk that is not very interesting.

20090309163506AAAweLm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend Advice, I think I screwed up....?	Need another point of view on this.      Long story short, My friend and I arent talking, we have talked, well I talk she listens. But nothing is resolved. I have had the impression she hates me, but the more I think about it. I think she actually misses me. What I took as strange behavior from someone that hated me. I think was actually her way of trying to work things out in a subtle way.      My way is not sublte at all, I say exactly whats on my mind. She on the other hand does not like to talk about any problem at all.      So I think that all the times she was actually trying to work things out with me I was too blinded by my own anger and what I wanted to say, that I missed her attempts to make up.      If this is the case and I basically have been ignoring her attempts to fix things between us, what do I do now? How do I fix this?      SO what do I do now?
20090309153524AAQeXyu	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it fair that my mum is asking me to pay towards housekeeping?	I'm seventeen and go to school. I also work eight hours a week in a clothing shop. My mum insists I pay for everything myself, from my school lunches to my phonebill to my clothes to my shampoo and soap.    Although I am happy enough to do this, I find that practically anything nice which I buy with my wages, like nail polishes or pretty soaps are stolen by my thirteen year old sister and I have to waste wages to replace.   I admit that I live a nice lifestyle, I don't make a lot of money but I can afford to buy myself nice clothes and the likes of Clinique skincare. My parents also earn enough that they do not need my wages- my dad is the headmaster of a highschool and my mum is a careers teacher.   With all of this in mind, do you think it is fair that my mum is asking for me to contribute to housekeeping? I earn about $60 a week, and this maintains food and tolietries, hanging about with my friends, my driving lessons and occasional new clothes, but if I lost any of it I would loose any luxuries, and surely that wastes the point of me having to sacrifice my time and my school work to travel into the city twice a week and work?   What do you guys think?

20090309152359AAyTrnh	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it just me or do all in-laws think they are invited to a private event?	I'm not one to usually be rude to my husbands family. They do that enough of that on their own. Why I have no clue? But my sister in law in particular, seems to have gotten it into her head that she's invited to our private renewal of vows. We never invited her, or told her any of our ideas. But she heard about it when my husband mentioned it to his mom just in a casual conversation. His mom knows she is not invited, but his sister thinks she is. So my husband called his sister specifically to tell her that it will be a private event, and were only planning for just our little family to attend. Sure no big deal I thought.       Until I started getting nasty e-mails, offline messages on my facebook, myspace, text messages, voice mail (on my cell phone). Telling me in no uncertain terms what a rotten person that I am for wanting to having something private with my husband. I've been called a bad wife, bad mom, and an evil person. All because were not including his sister.       Has anyone ever had an in-law that was just nasty like this, simply because they weren't invited to something private and intimate? If anyone has any good advice please tell me what to do about his sister.

20090309162416AAtdWji	Family & Relationships;Friends	Worried about a best friend..?	one of my best girl friends has done a 180 in the past 6 months. she has changed her style of clothing, music, and attitude.    after her ex dumped her, she has gotten really depressed. her mom took her to a therapist, but she walked out because she didnt wanna talk.   when her ex did dump her, she was at my house and she cut her self. i started yelling at her, and made her clean the cutt and made her promise me that she wouldnt do it again. but she is now doing it again.   yes, i and another friend of mine have told our school, and a parent.   we are thinking about having an intervention with her.   why?   our friend has been skipping practically all of her classes, and is making her "friends" skip with her. when they are freshmen. and when she does go to class, she sleeps.    she is always worried about her looks. she spends hours on her hair and make-up. when i go to her house in the morning, she makes her sister answer the door, when i am her friend. the other morning i waited over 5 minutes, and when she answered the door she said "sorry, my sister was too busy with her hair" and i couldnt help thinking "K, im your friend not your sisters, its not her responsibility to answer the door to me...."   anyways,   what should my friend, A, and i say when we do intervien?   should we just let out everything or what?   what do we do if she tries to walk away?   how many people should we bring to talk to her?      note: i am not giving out any names.   K is for the friend i am worried about   A is for the friend that is helping intervien.

20090309151856AAJ2yd6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why did she do this to me???..?	Im an 18 year old guy and I have this friend whos a girl that I met on facebook, and we’ve been talking online for months. She gave me her cell number, and wants to hang out JUST AS FRIENDS, but when I ask her to hang out, she keeps coming up with stuff to avoid hanging out. for instance last friday we were gonna hang out but her girlfriend (shes gay) left her for someone else and she wanted to be alone. and then 4 days later her mom lost her job, so she said she couldnt hang out cuz she needed to be with her family cuz she feels bad for her mom. thats a lot to take in 4 days. after telling me that, she blocked me on facebook, so i cant contact her. After finding out she blocked me, i texted her and called her and she ignored them all. my theory is that she just has too much going on, like too much drama and doesnt need me talking to her, asking her to hang out, cuz she said she feels bad when she blows me off like last week with her girlfriend leaving her. I then told her if she doesnt want to hang out with me, then she could just tell me. i've told her this numerous times and she keeps saying that she didnt say that, meaning she would want to hang out. plus she suggested we hang out and promised she'll make up for the time she blew me off last week. i just think she needs space for a little while. since she blocked me, i havent been talking to her, i havent texted her for like four days since she blocked me. i then texted her asking how shes doing and that im sorry for putting pressure on her to hang out... no reply. I'm now going to call her on thursday and if she doesnt answer im going to, on Sunday, go to the mall where she works, which is an hour away from my house, go in the store she works at (journeys), say hi and ask if its cool if we talk on her lunch break. And so i dont sound desperate, I will tell her was at a friends house around here and decided to swing by to run some errands and see how shes doing. does that sound like a good move, and one that she will appreciate/welcome??    thanks! =)=)=)

I only smoke when I get annoyed as it stops me snapping. I did anger management and I was taught to do something else when I felt I was getting angry and smoking works for me. I know it's not the best thing in the whole but I don't drink, do drugs (which is stupid) or anything else.    She doesn't see why I do it. I got the help because I didn't want to hit her again like I did once and I don't want to hurt our daughter either, I know it sounds like a lame excuse but it's not.

20090309154102AARszkN	Family & Relationships;Family	Should my stepfather be aloud to hit me?	Well it wasn't a belt, so thats out of the picture. It was more of a cross between a closed fist and an open hand, with some pushing, too. Last night he got mad at me for spilling the last of the juice. So he went off on me and he started hitting. He did leave a bruise on my right arm. I havn't said anything to anyone, not even my mom, because i wanted to be sure that i wasn't making a big deal out of nothing.       I've never done anything to provoke him into treating me this way, we normally get along with each other, so im not really sure what happened. This is the first time hes ever hit me too, but I've seen him hit my mom once, about 2 months ago, i don't think he did it again, though. So in your opinion should he be aloud to do that to me, even if it was his form of discipline? Would you tell your mom or hold off just in case?      PS: Im 13. My moms been married to my stepdad for about 5 months now.

I have moved to another state with him so he could take another job because he was about to be laid off. I am currently not working. Is it possible to divorce at this time? I was told that I would have to have a full time job what would allow me to be independant for at least a year with benefits until everything was settled. He makes all the money and I'm afraid he will empty the accounts if I even discuss this with him. I was also told I would have to freeze checking and savings accounts and take steps to keep him from cancelling my health benefits and auto insurance. What should I do? Please help. Also, I was told I would have to divorce in the state he lives in our house being sold is in another state which is where I would rather be.

20090309150921AAa0SO7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do young adults start dating with no experience?	What should I do to learn how to date a girl?  I have no experience at all in this field.  Where should I start?  What do I need to study/read?      About my situation: I've been working two jobs since I was 18 to support my parents and my younger brother (I'm 28 now).  Now that my young brother got a job, we split responsibility to care for our parents.  Although I now have some time for myself, I am also in a lot of financial debt, and it will take me 2 to 5 years to get my bank account to $0 dollars.  So that's why I don't spend money unless I absolutely have to, which I'm afraid a girl will hate me for.      Given my circumstance, what unforeseen challenges do I need to prepare myself for when finding someone really special?

20090309150931AAWmTfG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Deciding on divorce...just want opinions?	I am 21 years old and will be married for two years in July. I had been with my husband since I was 15 yrs old. We had problems during our relationship with fighting constantly and trust issues. We both thought we had moved on from those problems and he proposed and I said yes because at the time he was the love of my life. About a week before the wedding, I was really doubting myself and getting married but put the thoughts on the back burner figuring it was nothing and I didn't want my mom to lose the  money she had spent for the wedding. Our first year of marriage was a nightmare, fighting about money, house, everything that we expected to fight about but it was terrible. I understand marriage is not a walk in the park and it takes work so I was ok with all of this. This second year, I just lost all feelings for him and have no attraction left at all. I decided to leave and stay with a family member. During this time he has found Christ and completely changed his outlook on life. I think all of this is GREAT an amazing, but still not sure I want to be married. I guess I just feel like I was so young when I got married that I didn't have time to do anything on my own. I know I should have thought about this before I got married but being young, I thought it was forever. So now, he is begging me to stay so he can show me what kind of husband he is going to be and he is praying for me and I am so glad but at the same time feel selfish for not necessarily wanting to stay. I don't need advice really on what to do because obviously that has to come from me, I was just looking for objective opinions from people who aren't connected with the situation. Now I'm at this hard spot, listening to my family say that I need to give him another chance, that I owe it to the marriage, and his family telling me they love me no matter what. How can I make a marriage work when I'm not attracted to my spouse, and don't feel like i fully love him anymore? I'm just really confused and don't really know what to do. Thanks in advance for honest opinions.
20090309151619AAkyfPL	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I tell my friend I don't want to live with her next year?	At the beginning of this year, I had talked about moving into an apartment with one of my current roommates.  Eventually, it became three of us that were all going to live together.  However, I fell in love with this guy that I started dating, and have been together for six months now.  We decided that we want to live together next year (it makes sense because I love him, and spend about 75% of my time at his place anyway).  Recently, the other girl backed out of our living arrangements, and now my friend is relying on me to live with her.  How can I tell her I have other plans for next year without hurting her feelings?  It just doesn't make sense to get a place with her if I know I want to live with my boyfriend.  I can see spending the rest of my life with him, and it seems silly to pay rent for an apartment I would barely be staying at.      Please help!

20090309153748AAQZImS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do i do about my relationship?	ok this is a super long story. thanks in advance for taking the time to read it. my boyfriend and i have been together for nearly 5 years. before we met, i used to be pretty good friends with his sister, and then we just fell out of touch.( i never met him, he was her older brother) Anyways, ever since we hooked up, she has had a problem with it. She kicked me out of her house one night at 3 in the morning because he was staying with her and I was sleeping over. (we were sleeping) and so on. his family is extremely close, almost too close. his mom calls our house like 5 times a day ( and he's going to be 30 this year) and everything that she has said about me in the past, his family believes. I never had a fair chance with his family.      Well in the mean time, my boyfriend and i have picked out an engagement ring and he has started paying on it. She found out we were looking, but we told her we hadn't found anything yet because we wanted it to be a suprise.         So anyways, about a month and a half ago, she calls  me out of the blue to ask me if i would like to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, which i found wierd, but my boyfriend said she wanted us all to be a family. So for the next few weeks, she was calling me every day, writing me emails, pretty much just acting like i was her best friend. then it just stopped. she took the pic of my dress of her myspace, went and had the girls fitted without inviting me, etc... well about a week ago, she posted on her myspace that "she was sick of you and all your lies, if you want trash, you can have trash"...i didn't think of it much cuz she always has some drama in her life. well everyday she was updating it to say the same thing. then i got curious and did some investigating to who she was talking about. she had written on her friends page that "she was tired of her lying brother and his trashy girlfriend. God I hate her ugly trashy ***. " I couldn't believe it. Well now my boyfriend is pissed at her, my feelings are very hurt, and i don't think that we are going to survive this. His family is going to take her side, and I have had enough of it. He would never give up his family for me, which i would never ask him to...but now she is throwing a fit and will keep his nephew from him. All because she found a receipt that he had made a payment on our ring in her front yard.(it blew out of his car) and she is flipping out saying he is a liar because he didn't tell her that we had bought one. it's so crazy...i know. i just need some advice. I love my boyfriend, but I can't take his family anymore. What do I do?

20090309155519AAMoGjc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you ever trust again after a partner cheated?	My wife cheated on me a few years ago and I only found out as I was away sorting out our new house and came back to surprise her. She wasn't happy that I came back to surprise her. I was downstairs and her phone went and some guy was texting her that he was thinking of her and can't wait to see her again. I approached her and she said they had only kissed and didn't want to talk about it. Well we lived in the new house for a few years and then I decided to move back to where I come from as I hated the new country we lived in. I asked her to move back with me and she said she would think about it. Well I moved away and was enjoying being on my own, then she said she was going to sell the house and move back. She has had a problem giving birth and I am not sure whether she only moved back with me as she wants to try for a baby. Also I don't think I really ever trusted her after she cheated, will I be able to trust her again as forgiving is easy.

20090309160037AAEArZR	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm 13 and have a very bad relationship with my mom...(WARNING: EXTREMELY LONG!!!)?	OK... This is pretty long, but I will try to make it as simple as I can...      So, ever since my mom got married to my step-dad in November 2008, my mom and I have had (and still have) relationship problems. I don't like my step dad at all. My hatred for him is so unbelievable that you don't even want to see the thoughts that I want to happen to him. This is because he has caused my only 2 siblings, that I was very close to, to leave the house and now both my brother (or siblings) hate our step-dad AND OUR MOTHER. My mom chose to represent his side and not stand up for us. She has a greater love for this man. One day, my little brother's teacher called our mom and said that he was behaving very poorly in school and class. When my little brother got home that day (when he was living with us last year), my mom and step-dad beated him with their hands and a belt. I would hear my little brother scream and his body bang against the wall as hard as you can imagine. On that same day, my little brother was so mad that he decided to go live with our dad (whom lives near Fort Lauderdale, FL). Before all this occured, my parents got divorced and my father moved out on my 11th birthday (May 17). OK. Let's skip to this year... So, sometime last week, I was working on my homework on my mom's computer until I came across some photos. When I looked at them, I was so in shock that I couldn't believe it. They were pictures of nude, old people and my mom and step-dad were in them/it!!! I saw my mom sucking other guys dick(s), being eaten out by other men and women. I even saw here posing naked in our jacuzzi!!! My mom never was like that/this until she met my step-dad. I always looked up to her as a big influence in my life until I saw those pictures. Now I think of her in disgust and as a slut and whore and everything bad. I get so mad when I look at her face and when ever she touches me (kiss, hug, handshake, etc.). She gives out the worst punishments ever! My cell phone is my life and my biggest protection. Where I live... It's very unpredicatable. There are a lot of creepy, old(er) guys that watch girls walk home after school and I have a big fear of getting raped. She could at least take away my radio or computer or something. And now when I look at the future, I see that it is horrible. I want a good future. If I do the same thing that my little brother did, which was move out and move to my dad's house and live with them, then I will be able to start thinking positive and do every thing to have a brilliant future. But I feel as if I can't do that if I continue to live down here. My step-dad kicked my oldest brother, of 21 years, out when he was 19-20 years old. My brother is stuggling as of today and I feel so bad for him. He wants to go to college and get a good job, but he's so low of money. I am so pissed with both my mom and step-dad. I want to tell her, "EITHER I GO OR HE GOES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THE SH** HERE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD ANY MORE!!! IT'S NOT FAIR THAT LUKE AND MATTHEW DON'T HAVE TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND FACE THIS CR** EVERYDAY!!! I WANT OUT!!!". Did I mention that they both argue everyday, non-stop, over the stupidest things?! It's so rediculous that I can't even barely find the love in that relationship. Anyways, I went to school today and got some transaction papers for me to move to a school that is closer to my dad's house because after I finish FCAT this month, I'm going to try to make this mission successful. I want out and I am so for real. I'm done with what I'm going through today. My mom has countinously gotten worser. She doesn't cook, clean, lazy. Everything oppostite that a good mother is like. I don't know what to do. Should i just leave forever and not talk to her anymore or just deal with reality?
20090309160115AAJjUJ5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Relationship- Confused and hurt.?	Im 16 and dating a 19 year old. He is very very sweet and usually treats me very well. Im so happy with him usually. Ive never been in love before him but we have been together for so long and i know him so well, im possitive i love him based on how i feel. Anothing is that about a month ago i lost my virginity to him. We get in these really bad fights. He never hits be but he says things like im a whore and a **** and unclassy and not respect worthy and leaves me crying and hurt, just to call me in the morning and say he cant live without me and he didnt mean what he said and how much he loves me. Lately he has been very upset at the fact that i gave a guy on a cruise ship a BJ when i was fifteen (before i even knew him). He has had sex with six girls previously but cant let go about the cruise ship thing. Last night he said that he looks at me and just thinks about how disgusting i am and how im not pure for him along with a lot of other hurtful things. This morning he said he loves me and was stupid for thinking he didnt need me. Now he is upset and angry about the Cruise thing again and I dont know how to handle talking to him tonight (he is out of town for work for three weeks) and i dont know what to do. I love him so so so much and ive been crying all day thinking about not being with him but i dont know what is best for me and what i need to do in this situation.   Help?!

20090309160953AARLnwO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Two Brothers and one baby advice please?	I have very big problem. I know some of ye are most likely going to judge me or call me stupid over this but. I really need advice. Even though I think I already know the answer.    Ok so I am living with my boyfriend. He’s 19 I’m 17. His brother is 36 and sometimes when he is fighting with his girlfriend who is my two male best friends mother and my ex foster mothers sister.    One night we all went out to my boyfriend’s nephew’s birthday. While we were out a fight broke out between my boyfriend’s brother’s Girlfriend and his sister and him. At this stage I was on my 6th pint and my 5th vodka straight. So yeah I was drunk. But my boyfriend’s brothers G/Friend ended up going home and his sister was really upset. I was really drunk and said I was going to get a taxi home. I really couldn’t see straight. So I left the pub and started walking [wobbling] to the taxi rank. But then somebody pulled me back and I saw my boyfriend. He said I’ll come home with you I’m sick of that place. So off we went I feel asleep in the back of the taxi I had to be carried into the house. So we went up stairs and he started to undress me, then well I got in the mood so I pulled down his jeans and well we had sex.    Then I fell asleep I felt him get out of the bad but didn’t think much of it. Around an hour later I felt him get back in. He was very touchy feely and we done it ‘again’. When we woke up in the morning I said to him you were only up for it twice last night tut tut just making a laugh of it. The he goes we only done it once then you passed out. I thought he was to drunk to remember. So I asked him what he thought of the night, and he goes well I waited around two hours after you left and my sis cheered up so it was alright. I was like what? Who came home with me and he was like my brother, yeah he stayed after the fight last night. So then it clicked when my boyfriend went in for a shower I went to his brother and asked him and he said yes it did happen. Btw they look identical!! So I was very shocked but couldn’t face telling my boyfriend. Then I found out I am pregnant, I’m 2 months gone and the dates match up to that night as far as I can tell!! I haven’t told anybody yet. But I just don’t know what to do; I could be having my boyfriend’s brother’s baby?! Any advice please!!
20090309161006AAgayzN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need help getting my relationship back!!?	I love my husband more than words can say.  We have been married about 8 months and we have beautiful son together.  Lately it feels like we are falling apart, fighting a lot, it doesn't feel like it should.  Its not a lack of love because we both love each other.  We both had horrible first marriages, I was abused and he was mentally abused by his ex-wife.  Luckily I never had children with my ex, but he did with his.  I need some ideas to help get back to the way we were.  We also just had a miscarriage and I think he is having issues with losing our baby, but won't talk about it.  Has anyone else been through this??  Any ideas to help me??  Thanks!!!

There was this guy I went out with and he dumped me because I was "taking things way to slow" I wouldn't even hug him because I was so insure about myself.

20090309162042AAhbPzU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	MIL subtly questioned my morals asking what I and male guest were going to do during his visit what to do?	I thought the comment was inappropriate, and she often passes off rude inappropriate comments off as jokes. I really think it is a passive-agressive way form of of dealing with her loss and signals a larger problem. My husband pretended he didn't hear the comment and thus didn't address the comment when it occurred. He has offered to say something on my behalf, but I believe it would cause further issues. Most recently she penalized him for telling her that we were spending Valentine's together. I believe if he truly put me first , MIL's  comments would have bothered him enough to address the issue without there being a condition of whether I wanted him to address her or not.  I would ignore the comment, but she has made several other comments suggesting I should be happy that my husband has a good job and that he keeps me well dressed and she has told her daughter that I am not as innocent as I look. She attempted to come in between us by telling my husband about a situation between myself and her daughter. She only spewed out half the facts and then refused to acknowlege the girl's behavior suggesting that she had never witnessed her daughter act unruly. Several months before, the daughter in MIL's presence suggested that I didn't help her out because her brother was the individual who put money into her bank account. MIL did not correct this "joking statement," and did not apologize to me for her daughter's bratty behavior. Christmas Eve MIL also suggested that I allow her to spend time alone with him and made me feel a little jaded because I had already intended to make sure the two spent time alone. I didn't need her to raise the issue as she had hinted several times that I give the two time together before we had even walked down the aisle.  I really cannot continue to put up with her behavior much longer, and I cannot equivocate to my husband my angst. Ultimately, I feel like leaving him because he has not set boundaries and refuses to priortize his relationships. He has not been the best husband which is beside the point, but I cannot put up with both his antics and the antics of his family. I have suggested he spend time with her alone, that what she gets what she wants, and I my stress related illnesses are not exacerbated, but he suggests that makes it appear as though I am attempting to alienate him from her. I guess I should just suck it up and work on my issues with him, but I feel that she will continue to disrespect me. If we have children, I do not want my children to witness her disrespecting me and believe their father's loyalty is not with our (his and my) family. What am I supposed to do?

20090309174209AAs0k56	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get them to move?	I was living in Australia until about four weeks ago.    I moved to sweden to live with my dad because i really hated australia [at least where i lived] .   I really want to move to Nashville,Tennesse,USA because i really want to be a country singer and well i pretty much love nashville.   I keep giving my dad hints that i want to move there and he said he likes nashville but nothing more.   So how shold i tell him that i really want to move to Nashville? He's very intimidating and i think it would be very difficult to have a face to face conversation with him.   Should i just blurt it out or sit him down and talk to him about it?      Any suggestions ?      thanks x
20090309173838AA3UeKY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the difference between being a push over and being nice?	I'm a guy. Sometimes I want to be nice by eating where ever the girl wants to eat. I am very willing to pick a girl up. But sometimes girls see this as being a wussy.      Even worse, sometimes girls find this kind of behavior to be desperate. Like I am trying too hard to accommodate to her lifestyle. It's not that I don't have my own life, but I just like her and I want to show it. Don't girls like being treated like a princess, or like a guy who puts them first or above his friends?       PS every time I ask a girl where she wants to eat. She never knows. Girls expect guys to be the only one who knows where to eat or else he is a pushover. Girls can be so lame.

20090309170623AADc6iv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me?	There is this guy I really like in my class. He is my good friend and he knows I like him. Hes always staring at me, most of the time looks away quickly when I notice it. And he always makes jokes with me and is talking to me. Today I wasnt in school, and my friend told me he was asking where I was and all. Sometimes he'll insult me as a joke and be like "oh im so sorry" if it looks like I took it seriously. And he always defends me even if me and the person are just joking. Hes always wanting to sit by me and always comes by me everywhere I go. Whenever he sees me looking at him, he'll start talking to a girl and if I dont look I notice him stop like hes trying to get me jealous. And he always stares with this "look" when I talk to another guy. I think he likes me but is too shy to admit it. What do you think?
20090309175723AAXObZi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This shouldn't be a big deal?	One of my close friends is a guy (I'm female).       There is definately NOTHING romantic going on between us and frankly I don't see him in that way and I don't think I ever would.      Heres the issue, my boyfriend has been notoriously jealous and controlling in the past but has recently started relaxing about things and being much more open about how he feels and allowing me more freedom (we did almost break up over this as I couldn't handle it)      So heres the issue, I want to ask my boyfriend if I can go out clubbing with this friend for the night and probably crash at his. If this was a girl it wouldnt be an issue and I wouldnt be worrying about how to aske this.      The reason I want to stay the night there, is that he has already organised for some of our other mates to stay at his to watch movies etc until the the very early hours, so I'll miss the last train home and don't want to have ring my b/f early in the morning to pick me up from somewhere that doesn't seem fair to me.      so how do i approach this topic with him?      I'm worried tha the more worried I seem about it, the more it will be an issue for him?      sigh >_<

20090309180600AAPrZxR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..      I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now, I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..

20090309165516AAW8t2l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you get rid of the pain?	I think my marriage is over. I have so much pain and I don't know how to get rid of it. My wife that I loved dearly is only treating me as a friend and not as a husband or a mate. Her love for me had diminished and respect for me are non-existant. It's all due to my dishonesty with her over financial matters.  I had never cheated on her. I loved dearly yet she is so cold and black and white on things that I don't how to handle this.  I have grew so attached to her (21yrs of marriage) that I can't see over the fact that I will be one without her.  I's so depress at the moment and don't know how to manage my life without her. I sound so whinny. I'm a man yet I feel like a kid about to lose his mommy. I know I needed to grow up and face it like an adult but it hurts so bad... I have so much dreams to share with her. I wanted to grow old with her and take care of her when she is ill. Why can't she forget the past and look forward toward the future? I will change for the better. Not for her but for my self and the family. I can't stand the fact that my kids will have two dad and two mother. Oh I'm in so much pain I can't think straight!!! World, will it get better? am I losing it? I'm scare and afraid!!!!!    I'm about to move out of the dream house that I created and built. I'm just waiting for my niece to move out of my mom house and wait for my wife to finish her seasonal works. It's like a death sentence. God, what am I supposed to do? I have already lost my business. Now my true love, than my creations...What's next? Only my kids are keeping me alive. I'm too chicken to kill myself, I treasure life too much!!! But the fact that I'm about to lose everything really clouding my judgements??? I can't think straight!!! Please tell me it will be ok.

Now we are both 13. I don't go to her school. I go to a catholic school. She, to a public. Her school has fights and does bad things. She told me she drinks every weekend! She taped it! I am worried she's hanging with the wrong crowd. She even swears now. She has changed and I don't like it one bit. Her parents are really strict and don't know about the liquor she has been drinking! She has gotten drunk. Her dad would ground her for life. She told me to swear not to tell anyone. Oh, I am so worried. What should I do? I don't want to lose her as a friend. I don't want her to get into trouble either.
20090309175742AA1ePLE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Friend's Mom wants to have SEX with ME...?	I am guy (16). I go to my friends house often. His mother is like in her 30s and is quiet hot...if you know what I mean. She usually shows a lot of cleavage -- and I mean A LOT. She wears real small shorts and when she bends down, half of her butt pops outs. Her boobs jiggle all the time and what not. So the other day, I fetching something from my friend's room upstairs and his mom came in completely naked and closed the door and locked it. I just turned around and stared at her. She told me that my friend (her son) was going to a camp next saturday night and her husband was going to a business trip that same night and if I wanted to come over. I just said I will think about it and unlocked the door and left. Then, an hour later, I went to the bathroom and when I came out, she was there and she grabbed my hands and made be squish her boobs and then we made out for about a minute. What should I do? She is sexy but she is also my friend's mom! Should I spend the night with her?

20090309175613AAVHl9b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know how to read this girl...?	I'm afraid I'm over thinking the things that she's doing... for some reason, I guess I can't accept the fact that she might just be a shy girl toward guys like me she doesn't know in the hopes that she might have a thing for me. I've liked her almost since the beginning of the school year, we sit right next to each other in history class... Here are some things I've noticed, all MIXED:      -When another friend and I used to talk, she tried to enter our conversations, but we always sort of shrugged her off because she's really quiet and we didn't know if she had actually said anything   -She spends a lot of attention on me when my friend and I talk (could be that she's just interested in the convo, though); she'll consistently do it though   -She'll text a lot during the lecture   -Every time I walk up the row, she'll be staring at me like if I'm walking back to my seat after throwing something away   -However, a few times, she's even glared at me for some reason :x (trust me, we sit next to each other, she doesn't have eye issues)   -Whenever I actually turn my head in her direction to look at the teacher, she isn't looking at me and gets sort of squirmy (I guess I Would too, if a girl I Didn't know started doing that)            So...any insight? Am I probably just over thinking everything and mistaking her for just an ordinary human being? the glaring thing that's going on is throwing me off a bit and making me discouraged; would she glare at me if she truly liked me? i doubt it ...   We've spoken before, but it was only polite talk and school-related...
20090309180830AAOL1yc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Drama UGGGGGHHHH pls pls pls help?	OK, so a long long time ago I met this guy. Let's call him Rodrick. OK, sorry that's the worst name ever. Let's call him Jon. OK, Jon. So I met Jon because I go to an all girls school and he goes to an all boys school, and our schools are like sister-brother schools. My school had an event, and his whole group came, and we all hung out. Sucks for me, he was already dating one of my friends. Someone I was totally not super-close with, but nonetheless one of my friends. So I made no moves, in fact I barely spoke to him AT ALL. So, about six months later, (yes SIX MONTHS!!!) I hear from my best friend they broke up! I was CRAZY HAPPY. But the thing was, I didn't know Jon that well, so I couldn't like just start talking to him. There was a dance that Friday I was 100% positive he would be at, and I planned to go, just to talk to him, get to know him better. But I got really sick, pneumonia actually. And obviously, I couldn't go. But there was one next month, and I figured I'd try to just meet with him somewhere, I don't know. Unfortunately, my friend told me a few weeks ago Jon and my friend, (who happens to be one of my GOOD friends,) are now going out. Whoopee. So, anyway. I kind of had like a spazz attack. And then I went through a roller coaster of emotions. I was pissed that he liked her, angry he didn't wait, sad it wasn't me. But anyway, my friend got me together, and we chatted. We were with another one of our good friends, Lily, so I told her. She promised to keep it a secret. They told me I should get over Jon, but I couldn't. I just COULDN'T.    So the next day, they tell me to go on IM, and instantly I start getting messages from Jon. My friends had talked to him, and tried to get him to IM me. He had been so confused, Lily told me, with why we wanted so badly for him to IM you, I kind of blurted: "It's because she has a huge crush on you, Jon! I was MORTIFIED. But I still chatted with him. He actually flirted. And he told me he wouldn't tell his GF. And he didn't. Lily did. UGGHH LILY!!!! So now Jon's GF, Sally, always tries to get me to admit who I have a crush on, but I just don't tell her. I refuse too. But she knows. Lily confirmed she spilled, and also apologized. Few weeks later, we often IM'd and he flirted a little bit. So, the next dance was like major exciting for me.The night before we had IM'd and had a great convo, and he had flirted a TON. I went with my BFF's, but Sally and Jon would be there. They hung out the whole night, she CLUNG to him. He kept looking at me, especially when they slow danced. And when she left, he "accidentally" bumped into me and we started talking, then he came over and danced near me. I am so freaking confused. Please help me!!!       #1. Should I flirt with him?   #2. Should I just back-off?   #3. FYI, it is impossible for me to move on. I have never had such a HUGE crush in my life. But if so, any tips?   #4. Since my friends told him I liked him, since he didn't confirm he liked me too...is he just keeping it a secret? Or is there a chance?   #5. What signs can I look for that he's into me?   #6. How can I subtly flirt?   #7. There's a big ballroom dance coming up...do I dare ask him to dance when the girls pick??         thank you

Alright, if I am to be direct, how exactly do I go about getting her name and so on without sounding like a sex-raged pedophile. Sure, it would be simple to ask what her name is, but if that is all I ask and nothing else, would that not be akward? I only have a span of probably a minute in the lunchline (where I see her) to make any conversation until we both move to our lunch tables. Honestly, I don't even know how I'd be able to talk to her long enough to grab her number anyway.      I am EXTREMELY confident. But this ego of mine ultimately cripples me as I take criticism to the heart (no matter the severity). Ugh...I am way to analytical.

Ok, he knows this girl really likes me alot and that Ive been in love with her since the sixth grade and we're now in University. He only has hung out with her when I invited him to hang with us. However, he thinks girls like him just when they are their casual flirty selves, so I dunno if he has it in his mind she likes him at all.       He texts her everyday making sure she arrives at University safely which I dunno if that is normal or not? Also, even though me and the girl are not dating right now cause we want to wait to have a serious relationship even though we're doing other stuff, I made a joke once about how another girl looked cute and he called me an *** like that is cheating or something on her. Cheating even though we're not even committed and it was a comment. lol      So what do you guys think

What do i do?	so this guy i like is a senior, i'm a junior, his girlfriend is a senior. at the end of the year, he's going into the coast guard. he expects to have this gf there when he comes back, but the truth is, she won't be. she will screw around on him as soon as he leaves, but he doesn't see that happening.      on friday, she started yelling at him because he doesn't show affection towards her during the day, in the halls, but will after school at his house. the thing is, she is the kind of girl who would have sex in the hallway with people around if she could. she yelled at him for a good 20-30 minutes. the only thing he did was talk back trying to defend himself. then she got soooo pissed off that she got into her car, slammed the door, and blared the music. then she sped off. if he didn't move, she would have hit him.      in the halls, every time she sees me coming, she bolts for him. then puts a death grip on him. it pisses me off so much. in the end, i want him to dump her for me, and i want to be the one to be here when he comes back. i have waited for him for over a year, a little time while he's gone wouldn't bother me as much as if we aren't together.       so what do i do?   do i tell him what i think of his gf?   do i tell him my feelings?   do i just keep to myself and be happy for them?   PLEASE HELP ME!!!!   I'M AT  MY WITS END!!!!   THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION!!!!      =)

20090309174249AAYjU7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bachelor party?  Should you know what happens there?	My boyfriend won't tell me what he and the other grooms men are planning for a bachelor party they are planning.

20090309180320AA3Atp2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why was he unsure about taking my virginity? Did he stop liking me? I'm confused!!?	So he lives in Miami (my hometown), I go to school in New York and I met him over winter break...(he's 25, I'm 18). We made out at a party, really clicked...asked my sister if he could take me home with him, but I told him No! Then he asked me out and texted me the next day but I ignored it...He asked my sister about me (they work together) and she said I was embarrassed...Then I saw him that week and I agreed to watch a movie at his house when he asked again....(but I made it clear we wouldn't have sex)...      Well he was ALL OVER ME but I was really nervous and uncomfortable while he was trying to do things and he noticed...we started talking and he found out that I was raped bc I started crying when he asked if I've had sex before...then he kept saying sorry and said I was beautiful and gorgeous and needed someone who wasn't a jerk, etc. Next time I saw him, he wasn't as touchy feely and excessively flirty as before (which bothered me lol)....Then I left for New York and a week before I came down for president's day weekend I texted him and said I was coming....he seemed happy...long story short I said I'd be willing to sleepover this time (since he'd always want me to before, even just to sleep and not do anything). I also hinted that I wanted sex....then he said he couldn't take advantage and didn't want to lead me on since I live in New York and nothing could really happen...So I said I didn't care and asked him if he really liked me and felt attracted to me....he said yes but is unsure about taking my virginity (I'm technically not since I was raped tho) since its serious......then I mentioned how he seemed to really want it that night at his house and asked what changed....and he said "nothing changed. I'm just making sure you're ok." then I finally convinced him it was fine with me and when I asked again he said he wanted it too and it would mean something to him......but I am so confused....wouldn't a guy that said he likes me be really happy if I said I wanted sex? and not be so unsure and hesitant about it? to be honest, I was kind of offended lol any insight would be GREAT!       oh and I haven't had sex with him yet....when I came down to Miami last time, we were both too busy...so it would prob happen during spring break....and as a side note...i asked him if the rape thing freaked him out and he said no....I also kept asking him if he was sure about liking me and wanting to have sex and that I didn't want to pressure him into it. I also told him it was hard to believe and that I thought he was lying...and I think he got mad bc he said "Ok well I don't know what else to tell u but this is getting annoying"...then I apologized and he said it was ok...and he wanted me to talk dirty to him...and I did eventually and he says he's still interested...I'm seeing him this wednesday most likely...but at a lounge with my sister...what should I do?!? ADVICE PLEASE!! LOOL this is soo confusing!!

20090309175916AA2GhOP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He said he likes me a lot, but he currently has a girlfriend... What's a girl to do?	I've liked this guy since about October and everyone always told me that he liked me too. Neither of us ever made a move. But on Friday, I finally got sick of waiting and got a mutual friend to just tell him that I liked him. When she told him, he smiled, but had no other reaction. Today, she reminded him of their conversation and he said, "I really like her a lot, but I'm in a relationship right now."       It makes me mad because I'd been seeing him with a girl, that I didn't know around school. I guess that's his girlfriend. Anyway, my friends keep telling me I should get over him. Or they say I should break them up. They say he'll probably break up with her for me. But I don't want him to. I wouldn't want to be in her position if that happened.       Ugh. I'm so confused. What do you think? I wanna keep pursuing him, but I don't know if it's worth it. Should I follow my friends' advice? Any other comments?

He treats me really well and does a lot of stuff for me.  But, there are paticular things that bug me about him:      -Every time I get on the computer during the day, I always check facebook really quick.  He is usually with me and always says "you didn't say you were getting on facebook" and "I thought you didn't have much time"      -Every time I even look at my phone, he always asks "who is that?"      -He is convinced that my brother-like guy friend I have known forever is in love with me, when there has been no reason for him at all to think that.      -He doesn't like my other friend who he also thinks likes me (although I think he actually does).      -He is convinced that every guy that says hi to me "worships" me.      Is this typical for a guy or is this being too protective or possessive?

We hung out for maybe two weeks not even every day and then we had an on and off online relationship since then.

We've been together for almost a year and a half, and I've never been this bad. But honestly, I think it's because he's just gotten home from training.  I went from seeing him everyday in high school to barely talking to him and seeing him maybe 4 weeks out of 7 months.       Can I get y'alls opinions, please?      I mean, my life doesn't revolve around him. I have a job, I'm working on my photography and I'm in collage *not currently, though.

I have been with my husband for almost 8 years. He has 2 kids from a previous marriage. They are 9 and 8. His family over rules me on everything i say or do with the kids.

I don't get along with his and i feel like i have tried all options. Maybe i am missing something. I have talked to friends who are mutual friends. They all tell me that i don't deserve to be treated this way and i feel that i shouldn't be treat this way. I think that i went into this at a young age.

20090309165323AAAuPmz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation?	I was wondering how do you deal when you really don't like your best friend's girlfriend. I've known her for 2 years, she's 17. At first she was cool, but after a while I've noticed her true face. Behind her fake smile lies a gossip, immature & manipulating snake lady. When I hang out with them I pretend to have a good time, making her laugh, I just want my best friend to be happy.      I don't want to tell him that I hate his girlfriend or it will only create problems, and I think she doesn't like me either, but It's strange, she's the one who always invites me when we hang out. One time I made up an excuse, then my friend told me that she was furious about it. She always want things to be her way or it's hell on earth. Now when I'm doing a party and I invite her she's like ''oh, I don't feel right, maybe another time'', wtf!? That happen like three times, I don't invite her anymore because she's flaky.      So what should I do to endure her for all the years to come because I just can't take it anymore, I think I'm going to kill myself (sarcasm...lol don't worry).

20090309165445AAHSRo2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy really like me or is he just a player?	Alright so I have a guy friend who gives me hugs every day (at least 3..one day it was 7!) and we talk at school.  I have a huge crush on him and cannot stop thinking about him, but I do my best to not let that show in case he doesn't feel the same way. Today him and his friend were messing around and he got kicked in his...place. After that he has completely ignored me. I saw him walking down the hall by himself so i went over and tried to start a conversation. Well, he just kept on walking and didn't even make eye contact with me. It was the same way after school when I tried approaching him. Is he just hurting or is he annoyed of me?    PS: Any advice that has to do with forgetting him is completely impossible for me...he's all I can think about!
20090309180537AAKjcoU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I PLEASE have atleast 2 guys answer this question so I can get off this stupid thing????? 10 points!!!!!?	What would you do in this situation.?   I'm in my 20s and have moved to a city close to my aunt so she introduced me to her church. We've been going to church together every week and see and talk briefly to this guy around my age who I think I kind of clicked with. (We joke around and he's extra nice to me.)He kind of shows signs of interest      . I won't be in church this Sunday because I have to work.       Do you think if a guy was interested he would?   ask the aunt where the girl was (why she wasn't there)?   ask more about the girl to the aunt?    or even comment that he thinks she's cute or funny of something?   or say nothing because it's embarrassing to show interest?   (He's known my aunt for years and jokes around with her sometimes.)   He's more shy and serious around me when my aunt isn't around and it's just the two of us talking

20090309165952AAySTCd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should i go back?? I agreed in the first place.?	Soo Ive been dating this guy for about 5 months. He told me in the begining that he did not want a relationship. I agreed. Anyhow, I recently decided to end it because he was trying to talk to another girl. Even though I agreed in the begining that it was gonna be an open relationship I tripped because I care about him soo much. I mean we were practically living together.  But heres the thing. Considering that we were practically living together, the other girl got introduced to his kid, met his family and he asked her to chill with him on his birthday. I did not do any of these things. When I found all this out it hurt. BUT... according to her and everyone else she is not feeling him at all and really wants nothing to do with him. What Should I do. I miss him.

I then saw him leaving the building but he reappeared all of a sudden again and i gave up hiding..but as he walked past he stared at me intensley and i felt like i was being inspected. He then went and sat down once he had looked at me. It is a little scary sometimes, i'm not sure what to make out of his behaviour?

I didn't exactly like him, but im like why not? 5 days after that, I broke up with him telling him my mom didn't want me to go out with. That was a lie, though. For some reason, I started liking him, and asked him out. He said yeah. This happened 3 months after the first break up, but then I broke up with him for the second time. He acted like he didn't care at first, but he started calling me non stop, and telling my friends lies about me. After that I stopped talking to him, and started avoiding him. About a month after that, he went to my friend and told her to tell me that he was sorry for everything he did to me and said about me. That was so sweet, that I think that I like him again. I also heard that he still likes me. I don't know what to do. I don't think our relationship could last. Please gve me advice.

20090309125640AAb1ieN	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding photographs still not delivered...?	Our wedding photographer stated in her contract:      "The photographer agrees to promptly edit and present images for client proofing and release for prints in approximately four to six weeks. In the event the photographer is unable to provide said images within the specified time period due to an act outside the photographer's control, the photographer shall make every attempt possible to deliver said images as soon as possible thereafter and may offer the clients a discounted rate or compensation."      Well, she is currently at 10 weeks past the wedding date and we still do not even have proofs, much less prints. There is no reason for this delay and I have not rushed her, simply asking when she thinks they'll be ready, "next week"..."next week". Do you think she should compensate us for this extra 4 weeks of waiting? The novelty has worn off, no one is as excited to see them anymore. We paid her a lot of money, all upfront, so how much do you think she should refund if we originally paid her $2,700?

20090309174058AAbNnEz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I broke up with my boyfriend, but i still love him!!?	Me and my ex boyfriend are both 17 years old, we were 14 years old when we met. I broke up with with him because he has changed so much, hes not the same guy i fell in love with a long time ago. he don't ever seem happy when we are together, hes rude sometimes, very snappy,and hes always got a attitude, and when i ask him whats wrong with him, or try to talk to him he gets mad at me. I've tried everything i could possibly do but it seems i always fail. the only time he ever seems happy is when hes with his guy friends or with his family.and when we were together he would always get mad at me if i asked him questions like where he went, or who he was hanging out with, or just simply asking him what hes done all day he would tell me i ask to many questions and he don't have to tell me what he does everyday cause im not his mamma. I really wanna be back with him more than anything, but I want him to be the one that comes back to me. We dated for 2 years and 8 months and i can't imagine the rest of my life without him in it. i don't wanna date anyone else because this guy has my heart completely but I just want him to change. He always told me that the worst thing that could ever happen to him was to lose me so now that im not his anymore do you think he will change and come running back to me?   this quotes is whats keeping me strong   If you love something, set it free; if it comes back it's yours, if it doesn't, it never was."   I just don't know what it is that he wants!!   I am very attractive, good figure, sweet, very respectful, passionate, independent, caring, I would NEVER cheat on my guy, honest...and forgiving, mature & responsible, I have been 100% faithful to him, loyal and honest, i've tried being sexy for him in every way, I would cook for him when he would come over, kept up my looks at all times, was affectionate, praised him and told him how great and sexy he was, paid for half of everything-always, was nice to his friends, watched movies he likes, could dress up like a lady or sit on the dirt and go fishing or hunting with him, encouraged him to do the right things, Basically...I Loved Him Dearly !!!!!      My complaints: he wasn't loving towards me as much as i wanted him to be. He was always moody, he seemed more happier when he was hanging out with his friends and family more than hanging out with me. He always seemed to have money to go to the gym, and play paintball, but he never had money to take me on dates so i always paid for everything just so we could go off and do things together so we wouldn't have to set at my house or his. He never had the gas to drive out to my house so i would only get to see him on saturdays and sundays - but through it all I still love him unconditionally.      His complaint: He said i didn't have to know everything he was doing or where he was going or who he was hanging out with. I had trust issues (yes I did for some time-that's what happens when you find girls numbers in his phone and in his pants pocket and when girls write you on myspace and tell you stuff your boyfriend has been doing at school-but I let the trust issues go and moved forward and kept loving him.      We have took two breaks and now i finally broke up with him but i still wanna be with him i just want him to change and come running back to me! I've not called him or text him and im just scared hes gonna think(well she broke up with me so she can come back to me) but i want him to come to me!!      please help me out!!!!

20090309175919AArRJLg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	These are signs she may like me right?	i wouldn't be asking cos i hate people that do this but im extremely insecure and totally girl retarded and really like this girl. and sorry about writing this ridiculous essay lengthed question.       quick history - someone told this girl sophie i thought she was a mega babe a few months ago, she didn't really seem interested. talked to her for the first time in a month or so at a party on friday.      - friday firstly rather than just been like hey she came up and hugged me and we talked for a while and seemed quite interested (i thought) which shes never done b4 and then l8r on i was just chilling on a bed in this room by myself (didn't ask me why haha) and she just came over and lay down next to me and we had this really sweet d&m for like an hour b4 this other girl came in the room and tried to hook up with me and then when i finally managed to get this other girl off me and out of the room i looked over at soph and she was just lying on the bed turned away from where this girl was trying to hook up with me and then a couple of other girls came in the room and ruined the rest of the convo so i left and didn't get a chance to try kiss her (except for the whole previous hour but anywayyyy lol) then a bit l8r on a caught her checking me out once or twice and each time i looked at her she just looked down really fast. and she left pretty soon after that.      i then saw her again on sat but only for about 30 mins cos i couldn't stay at this party for long and when i arrived at the party she came over and talked to me again for a bit but then we got surrounded by a bunch of other ppl and couldn't really continue the convo and then i had to go so i went over and said goodbye and she hugged me and then kept holding onto me (but in one of those weird one armed hanging on hugs not both arms and she didn't really look me in the eye just at the ground) and said 'as if u have to leave already we didn't get to have a d&m like yesterday' but i asked her if shed be at this party nxt sat and she was like 'yeah... well we can go and find a comfy spot (referring to the bed from friday) and d&m then' or something.      now the bad things - i was talking to one of her friends who said she has very high standards and is waiting for a prince charming or some bs (which i definitely am not) and she was drunk both times i saw her and before that i had only seen her sober and her friend was telling me she becomes a lot more talkative and easy to talk to when shes drunk and relies on being drunk to talk to guys (shes shy i guess). and she hasn't talked to me on facebook and i added her on msn but she hasn't been on yet either... also after doing some serious facebook stalking i saw one of her friends left her a comment on sunday asking if soph remembered talking about maybe going on a blind date on sat night and if she was interested in doing it nxt weekend but she replied that she didnt really remember and that she didnt think she was a set up person but maybe one day she would meet up with him because the both have this weird thing in common (cbf explaining but it has to do with how they watch tv in this really weird manner). so yeah this whole thing could just be a product of drunkenness+my imagination. so yeah opinions.....?

( does the "girl code" apply here?)   Second: i hear from my friend that he liked someone else   third: i cant ask my other friends because of that whole "girl code" thing, and i don't want to cause any drama.   fourth: at school, he never looks my way, and never says hi. does he really not see me? or is he avoiding me because of embarrassment.   Also, how do i know if hes flirting or not?   he always like to poke my side to make me laugh, and he says that I'm hella fun, and he says i have soft cheeks. he always likes to touch my face,and make me laugh.    at practice, he always jokes around with me, and we aim each other for hours, but he never talks to me at school   he also said that I'm not like the other girls,    I'm so confused   i don't want to ruin our friendship   help!

20090309180847AAqc1mi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I chase him for a date?	We have gone out to dinner (first date) and then dinner and theater (second date). We have great conversation and seem to have a lot in common. I like him, but I don't think that he is as interested. He has kissed me on both dates and on our second date held my hand throughout dinner, and then during the play we went to. We ended up back at his place where we kissed for an hour, then, considering I had an hour drive home, walked me to my car, kissed me a few more times and then sent me on my merry way. He made no mention of ever seeing me again and only text messaged me the next day to say he was happy I made it home safe. I don't know if I should continue to put my effort into someone who I don't think is really that interested, but, maybe I'm just being paranoid. I had to inticiate the second date. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

20090309182205AAm6cDC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he mad about the eye contact?? He is so rude to me!?	I had some strong eye contact with a guy last year in the hallway at school. He was just looking at me so I looked at him back. There was no smiling or anything...pretty much a stare down and then I had to look away.      I have a class with him this semester and he listens in to conversations I have had outside of class and says some of those exact things I have said in class?? He has done this about 4-5 times      He stood beside me once in the hallway so I looked at him and he starts making a big deal of out this poster that is beside him on the other side and started talking to this other girl.      I had to hand him something in class and he looked above my head and said thank you (avoiding eye contact).      Why is he being so rude?? He is confident and talks to everyone else in class.

20090309181732AAr4Ebc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love my boyfriend, but ........?	I like someone else.   I'm 16 years old, and my first boyfriend was at 13, and we lasted almost 2 years. Literally, not even a month later, I met a new guya who I really liked and we're gonna make a year and 2 months on the 13th of this month. I asked him for a break last week and so we've been on it since than. He's crying, he's upset, and I'm upset too but I really needed this. I feel like I'm not being a 16 year old girl. I love him, he's GREAT, we never fought or anything, but I sort of wish he was just my best friend now. I don't really want a boyfriend now. I just want to focus on hanging out with my family and friends, and I wanna focus on school.   now, I like this new guy. I DON'T want to go out with him, since I just said I don't want a relationship. but I just met him and he's extremely sweet, and funny. he's 2 months younger than me where my actual boyfriend is 2 years older than me. he's a little too serious for me, he's talking about how he wants to marry me. I'm not ready for that but I really don't want to lose him as a friend, he's that perfect. I've told him everything just not as heavy, cause I think honesty is the best thing, even though I know it must of hurt him. I've felt this way with my ex, and I KNOW it hurts, but I tried to tell him as lightly and sugar coated as possible, it didn't work. now I'm just so confused. I don't even know if I really LIKE this guy, or if I just like him cause he's fun to be with. oh and by the way this guy really likes me too, and he knows my whole situation (I'm really honest). we've been hanging out and he tried to kiss me yesterday but I moved away, I felt guilty. my best friend told me to kiss him to see how I feel. she thinks the problem is that I'm just not attracted to my boyfriend anymore, and she may be right.   help pleaseee? I don't wanna hurt my boyfriend OR this new guy.   and one of my close friends is a lesbian and she likes me, and she doesn't want me hanging out with this new guy. they're friends, I kinda met him through her, but I guess she's jealous. and I've been sneaking around to hang out with him and lying to her, but I just can't tell her because she's SO hard headed. she'll stop talking to me just like that.   high school drama is ridiculous -_- i've avoided it for 3 years, not it's all coming. ughhh. lol
20090227095315AAsM23R	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with money problems?	My family have money problems and my parents might lose their jobs also, my parents keep fighting because of it, what should we do?
20090309181744AAP5Svq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What am I to do? He's messing with my head!?	Maybe not on purpose and maybe he doesn't even realize it, but I hopelessly can't stop thinking about him and it's driving me insane. He won't even bother taking a look my way or pay attention to me. We've never been in a relationship before...nor even close as friends. Can't even be called aquaintance since we don't really talk. But I see him so often in a single day and know him for many years. The thing is, I felt this huge connection whenever I'm near him. I don't want to though. My friend is in love with him. She told me so and I don't want to ever like the same guy my friend like. I really want to stop liking him. But I just can't when I'm stuck seeing him everyday and have to deal with this stupid feeling I'm having around his presence. I don't think he's interested in me, nor wish him too. It would then suck for my friend. I just want to not like him anymore. How am I suppose to do that? Thinking negative stuff about him doesn't work because in the end, it's still cute and lovable no matter what. Avoiding him is impossible, without making it obvious and so people will began to question my doing and my feelings for him (no body knows that I like him beside myself and whoever's reading this). I tried this, tried that, none of it works. My goodness, I don't even know why I like him so much! He's not the best looking guy in this world - a very average looking guy. Not even a gentlemen, not anywhere near my ideal "dream" guy. But I really like him and it's really bothering me - so much that I'm really upset at him for making me like him (though it's not his fault because he's not even doing it intentionally, nor even know that I like him). It's just another stupid puppy-crush! I can get over the other ones so quickly and easily, but why not this one? HELP? Please?

My sister is gonna name her baby after my father but heres the funny thing I was named after my father so it would be common sence that I would carry on the name when I name my Boy. and also my sister was named after our mother so that led me to believe that when she had a girl she would carry on that family name which she did when she gave birth a couple years ago How do you think she would have felt if I had used her name.

We moved to vegas june 08, I was supposed to get a teaching job but with the economy and budget cuts I didnt get a teaching job, now I am working at a check cashing/payday loan place. My fiance has not found a job yet, he has done a couple of side jobs and brought in a couple hundred here and there. Since he hasnt found a job I am the only one supporting us and it puts a lot of stress on me, therefore making me angry with him all the time. I feel like he is living off of me and we are never going anywhere due to the fact we both want kids and to get our lives together. He has applied for jobs but with the economy he hasnt found anything. I really dont know what to do I love him with all of my heart and I want to spend the rest of my life with him but we are going nowhere and we fight all the time due to our financial situation... any advice????

20090309181715AAfxaJk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are we making love or *******?	I've known my x for almost 6 years altogether. At the beginning of our friendship, he fell in love with me. He thought I was the most beautiful girl in the world, he wanted to do everything for me. He was so in love with me, hed leave roses on my doorstep, he went through hell just to talk to me, he fought with his family and friends. He really loved me beyond anything that i have witnessed so far in life. He wanted to give me the moon. However, I had a boyfriend, and wasn't interested. His extreme love for me lasted for about 2 years. Then it subsided but we continued being friends for a year or so. We were always close. 2 years ago, I broke up with my boyfriend at the time. i realized I loved this guy who was ready to be my everything. However, he lost the feelings he had for me, after all he tried for 2 years to be with me and i rejected him every time.       I slept with him, we saw each other, we continued being friends, and I was desperately falling in love with HIM now. He said he would never feel the same for me, but after much pleading and sex and talking we decided to date. It lasted 5 months, then he left me, saying he couldn't fall back in love with me. This was a month and a half ago. I cant let go of him he was my soul mate. We still talk for hours sometimes, and he says he is fatally attracted to me still, the same as he always was, but the love isn't there. We still have sex and it kills me. He says he'll always care for me and love me but will never be "in love" with me again. But im starting to feel like a piece of *** that he comes to when hes horny. I want to know that he appreciates me, AT LEAST, and that this isnt some typical "hes just ******* you now..."  kind of deal. I dont know. MY point is, when i see it that way im more hurt, when i see it as though he still loves me in some way, then im okay with sleeping with him. my feelings are still very much involved and we have amazing sex. im ok with us just having sex, as long as i know he doesnt see me as some whore off the street. i want to be appreciated. SO does he genuinely still care for me and we stll make love or is he just ******* me now?

20090309181928AAM5mug	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell my boyfriend of 3yrs that I don't want to be with him anymore?	I've been with my boyfriend for about 3yrs. We lived together 2yrs and now we got our own place because he could not help me pay for the bills so we got behind and I  had to move. Now that we've moved out I feel that he was using me to have a place to live because he was never coming up with any money or jobs. One thing or another would come up for possible jobs but there was no money coming in on his part. I know in these economic days its had to come by a job but I get the feeling that If we were to get married and have a family that he would not be a good provider. How do I tell him that I don't want to be with someone that is not financial stable for a 38yr old man.
