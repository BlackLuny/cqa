20090205125714AA6pjjs	Pets;Dogs	Ear infections with a flop eared dog?	I have a basset hound mix who has had chronic ear infections.  I understand this is common in the breed as the shape of the ear promotes bacterial and yeast growth.  For the past few months, I've started taking her for car rides - almost every day - leaving the window down enough so she can hang her head out the window as dogs love to do (I live in a warm climate).  Since then, no ear infections.  I'm wondering if the ears being blown back and allowing air to circulate have basically taken care of the problem.  Any thoughts from any professionals?
20090205125507AA0COlH	Pets;Cats	I was considering a kitten...but now an adult cat.?	Ok well, when I was 8, my family adopted a cat, who was 7 years old. I loved this cat so much. The cat was actually mine, but obviously a rescue center wont give a cat to a child. She was my best friend ever, and last october she had to be put down from cancer which had spread. It broke my heart to see her attatched to a drip, which was the only thing keeping her alive. :'( I really feel lonely now. I am 13 now and I had the cat for only 4 years. I wanted a kitten recently, but my family took me to a rescue center and I saw so many loving adult cats just looking at me out of their pens, as if they were saying 'please take me home'. I am a cat lover, and I was so sad to see this. Now I want to get an adult cat, but I really did want a kitten. Kittens are the first to get adopted, and I dont think enough people give the Adult kitties a chance. My cat was adopted as an adult, and she was the most loving animal I ever met. My heart wants me to get an adult cat, but my head wants a kitten! I dont know what to do. can someone help me? Can you please tell me the bad points of a kitten and the good of an adult cat. thank you.  And btw my old cat was spayed, and so will my next one... When I walked up to one of the pens at the center, the cats  were being really cute and were like they knew I wanted to take them home...

My dog is a rescue and is extremely shy and nervous, im planning to move to New York City for school this August and want to know if there is any kind of sedative I can give him for train rides. Its hard enough to get him on the street I cant imagine bringing him on a train if he is fully alert. I don't want to have to do this to him but what kind of conductor is going to let a shaking dog looking in all directions get on the train? I cant leave him at my parents house and driving is just so terribly inconvenient and most likely not possible. I need something that will calm him but allow him to function.    I can only imagine what the first few weeks are going to be like.

Her food was still there. I had no idea what was going on. Then around 4:00 pm, she started heaving. She eventually threw up bile and what looked to be like part of a craisin. I had no idea she could have gotten one. It must have fallen off the table last night at dinner. She seems to be ok (she isn't lethargic or anything like that) but she won't drink or eat.      What should I do?       BTW I have an 8 pound yorkshire terrier.

20090205134431AAP6nih	Pets;Reptiles	Heating my Ball Python's tank?	I have a ball python, and I currently have on one side under the tank a heating pad.  On top of that side I have a half-log for him to hide under.  On the other side I have a water bowl, and above the tank on that side i have a heat lamp.  During the day, the lamp is on, at night, it is off.  I consulted with a friend, and he said that I should put the heating pad and the lamp on the same side, so that the BP could have a cool side if he wanted, and to put the log on the cool side.  I did this a few days ago, but my BP seems more cold than before.  His body is cold, and sometimes he looks like he's shivering.  Now I know under the lamp gets ~88-90 degrees.  I had originally put the heating pad under the log because I live in DC during the school year, and it gets cold, and we usually keep our apartment at ~70 degrees.  I'm just worried he's not coming out enough during the "day" to get warm...I guess at "night" he does, and can be on the heating pad, but the heating pad does not make it as warm as the lamp.      Question: Should I put both the pad and the lamp on the same side, or should I put it like I had originally? Is it bad if my snake's body is cold, or that he looks like he's shivering?

20090205144352AAkTPpU	Pets;Dogs	Do you think your dog is smart?	Dallas, my year old Labrador, has discovered trading. She proposes what she considers "fair swaps" when she wants something that you've got.      When our younger Lab pup Jessie has a ball Dallas wants, Dallas will go find another toy, and offer it as an exchange. She'll play with it for a minute in front of Jessie to get her interested, then when Jess leaves the ball to join in the new game, Dallas gives her the new toy and takes the ball she originally wanted. It's all very well thought out.      Tonight, I was eating a bag of toffees and both girls were watching me (as they do) and after a while, Dallas went off and came back with a cardboard toilet paper inner-tube, and put it on my lap - I have no doubt that this was what she considered a reasonable swap for half the toffee I was currently chewing. She loves toilet paper rolls, these are usually a guarded possession (until she rips them to pieces and plays with the pieces).

20090205141810AA1UwaW	Pets;Dogs	How horrible is it to take a 6 week old pup from the mother? How do I care for it?	This guy that my boyfriend works with just got a catahoula leopard dog puppy today. We are going to keep puppy at our house tonight because for some reason or another the guy HAD to pick him up today but wont be home tonight. I don't know every detail, my boyfriend just called me and asked if I minded that we babysit a puppy tonight. Of course I said that's fine, but then my boyfriend said the puppy just turned 6 weeks old today. I told him I don't think it's healthy for pups to leave the mom until they're 8 weeks old. I know people do it all the time, but I've only owned one dog from a puppy and he was 10 wks before the owners let me take him home. I am not about to call and lecture the owner of the puppy, and neither will my boyfriend. Its definitely not my place to do that. The guy seems to be pretty responsible and experienced, he raises and trains hog hunting dogs. He is sending food for tonight. So my questions are:       How bad is it for the pup that he's not with his momma right now?   How should we care for the puppy tonight while he's at our house?

20061231105752AA8YlVe	Pets;Dogs	I have a 4 year-old, male toy fox terrier and we are looking at adopting a 2 year-old female chihuahua...?	our tft is a big-time daddy's boy and gets jealous of him pretty easily. he is realitively dominant, but never aggresive - he tries to bully you at first but he never gets physical. he never bites, but he growls at dogs he is unaccustomed to. We have introduced him to some dogs at which at first he growls, but after a while he doesn't mind them. The chihuahua wasn't abused and is very affectionate i'm told. do you think this would be a good match? Do you think if i introduce the two dogs in the right way that they would get along? Any advice would be great!    In case you don't know what a Toy Fox Terrier is it's like a slightly larger chihuahua. he's about 13 lbs (he's on a diet though, he's supposed to weigh 10 lbs) and the chihuahua is 7 or 8 lbs. Thanks!!!

While she was playing with the other dogs, she would urinate several times. We noticed after several times, she had blood in her urine. This is the first time we've seen this. And this doesn't happen at home. Today we took her to the same dog park to see what would happen. We called the vet and scheduled an appointment. They said it may have been that she was marking her scent (do females do that too?) and was pushing her bladder too much.      How do we prevent this from happening? She enjoys the dog park a lot. and she drinks lots of clean H20, and has a healthy diet. What do you think?

I checked and my pup does meet the AKC standards listed for Shih Tzu on their website, but I know I'm no expert. Anyways, I was wondering if you can have a non AKC dog registered with the AKC? I figure you must be able to, because otherwise how did the first AKC dogs of each breed come to be registered? Both his parents were CKC (which I know means nothing) as purebreads , and so on back for several generations (FYI, CKC does allow anything to be registered, but that is because unlike AKC, they have PUREBREEDS and NON-PUREBREED catagories). His parents were listed as purebreads.   But anyways I was just curious.

20090205154226AAhcKlQ	Pets;Dogs	Why are some people such pricks?	So, I take my Pit Bull out to use the bathroom and this young man (Probably about 18 or 19) stands just out of reach of her and starts taunting her.       She tucks her tail between her legs and runs behind me and I give him a nasty look... And he continues to stand there and growl and bark at my dog, while acting like he's going to throw a basketball at her.       He stops for a moment and says "She's a Pit Bull, right? She looks like she could really hurt someone."... I respond that she's afraid of men and he's scaring her and ask him to stop and he immediately starts doing it again as turn around to take her back inside.       And people like that wonder why they end up in the hospital because of a dog attacking them.

20090205154452AArYEf7	Pets;Cats	My cat drools when I pet her...is she sick?	I just got a 4 year old female cat from a friend's friend,  She seems fine but drools a bit when people pet her, other times a little bit as well, like when she is lying on the bed.  It evaporates fairly quickly so it doesn't seem too bad but is annoying when it gets on one's clothes, furniture, sheets etc...  Here eyes seem fine and she is eating regularly and using her litter like normal.  She drinks lots of water and is very affectionate when she feels like being so.  I assume she is perfectly fine but have never seen a cat drool before.  Is she just excited, allergic?  We do have a lot of carpets here.  Maybe still getting used to my place because she lived with someone else since she was very young.  I have never owned a cat before so pardon my seemingly dumb questions  hehe      Also I have heard that a cat's mouth is really dirty because of bacteria etc...so is her drool toxic?  Should I wash my hands everytime I'm in contact with it or if she nibbles my hands? I also noticed that after she uses her litter she licks herself to make sure she is clean which is great, but that must certainly contribute to the filth in her mouth right?  I guess it would to humans as well if we routinely licked our butts...some people do!  hehe         I'm sure I am over-reacting but I just want to make sure my place doesn't become a cesspool of bacteria and raise chances of people getting sick from cat germs.  Thanks!

He was acting completely normal when i last was playing with him (which was an hour before we found him) and had no health problems so i was shocked.  I've been crying every time i think about it and i even missed school today.  We called the vet this morning and they said that male cats often get random heart attacks or he could of been poisoned by antifreeze(which is stuff you use in your car to protect the cooling system).  I don't know what to do and i'm scared i'll start crying when i'm at school. I loved mario like a son. How do i get over it?

20070521181556AAbB5CF	Pets;Dogs	How wise or  fair is it to own a puppy when you are never home to pay it any attention?	I have a friend who wanted a puppy very badly  to keep her company in her apartment. She spends most of the day working and visiting friends and going out a few nights out of the week also. Sometimes she insist on taking the miniture toy dog with her but is easily offended when her friends get upset because she has no control over the dog. It's been little over a year and the dog isnt even close to being house broken (another common complaint among her friends). Am I wrong for thinking that she is selfish for wanting to have a pet so badly despite the fact that she doesn't give it a reasonable amount of time and attention? What's more, the dog stays locked up while she's gone and she very rarely walks it although she may carry on one of the few times that it actually gets out of the house.

20090205000145AAHXxrX	Pets;Dogs	How can I housebreak my german shepherd cross.?	She is 20 months old, we have a staffie too who's 5 which is completed house broken. The thing is when we bought our new dog 20 months ago, circumstances changed in mine and my partners careers that in turn made it near impossible to train her. basically the main problem is overnight where they are both put in there bed in the kitchen where they are locked in because she ruins the carpet, etc in the living room in the past. Every night she does a wee or a poo or both in the kitchen. For the last 3 days from the moment I get up I'm supervising her constantly and going out with her, when she does something I praise her. She is averaging 9 - 12 wees and 2 - 3 poos a day. usually 1 or 2 wees and 1 poo being overnight. I don't know what to do, carry on and will it improve and she will finally get the message or do we get a crate that my partner has suggested? Can anybody give me some sound advice that works because we don't feel like cleaning up every morning for the next 10 years potentially. We also don't tell her off when we come down to the mess and also don't clean up in front of her as this is what we have been told. Hope someone can help, thanks in advance.
