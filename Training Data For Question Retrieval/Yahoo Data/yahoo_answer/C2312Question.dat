20090219183051AARAdKF	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How would I view past valedictorian's submitted applications?	I'm going to be applying to college next fall. First off let me start with saying that I want to get accepted into a prestigious college, such as MIT, Georgetown, Princeton; (I haven't made up my mind on the specific one yet) and I want to shine when they review my application. I even went out and bought a bunch of "applying to college" books to help ease the process. You could call me a good student: I receive good grades, am ranked in the top 10% of my grade etc, but that's not really what I want to get into now. I was wondering if there was a way for someone to view past valedictorian's applications that they used to get accepted to the top colleges of the country. Now I'm saying valedictorians, but really I mean anyone who received acceptance into the top colleges. I want this information because: I have good grades, I have good test scores, I have everything the "average" appliqué  would have, and THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. My friend who recently applied for Harvard had everything perfectly that I could think of: 35 ACT score, 2290 SAT, 4.0 unweighed, 6.2 weighted GPA, tons of clubs, volunteer hours, member of Mensa, and he still was rejected. Of course he did eventually end up going to Brown, but I want to know how to get accepted into Harvard, when he got rejected with all the things he's accomplished. I want to copy the best students of the country for my benefit, as it's the only thing I can think of for getting into one of the top colleges of America.

I recently took it, without studying AT ALL, and got a 1670, which i dont think is that bad.

I would love some guidance and helpful advice is appreciated.      GOD BLESS

20090219190914AAzC84j	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Could my idea possibly work?	The dorm I am going to be staying in doesn't allow pets, I have a chihuahua and she cant stay with my parents, I'm not getting rid of her, and I am not boarding her or fostering.       She is very very quiet, very obedient, she is trained very will by my self, she has never crapped or peed in my house or anywhere else. She is very social and kind to everyone unless you are mean to her. But she doesn't bite she actually has never bitten anyone. She doesn't jump on people or scratch. I keep her very clean by washing her once or twice a week. I keep her toe nails clipped. I even brush her teeth every other day. Its amazing that I find the time to do all of this.      My idea is to debate with the dorm directors, I take Zami (chihuahua) in with me for a meeting about this and show them how such good behavior she has. When they told me that they didn't allow animals, I asked why and they didn't tell me anything other than allergies, and I could pay extra to not be roomed with not allergenic. And the other reason they mentioned was cleanliness and I would tell them how well I keep her.       so what do you think?

Ok, before people start freaking out on me, yes I know that an I.Q test can't possibly measure all intelligence equally, and there's many different forms of intelligence, etc. But I was wondering- is 136 a high I.Q? Because I have an I.Q of 136, but since I'm in Gifted classes ( which you have to have an I.Q over 130 to be in), most of my friends have I.Qs in the same range. So I was talking to one of my friends who is in Advanced classes, and he asked my I.Q., then seemed blown away by it. Is it really a high score? I thought it was normal since that's what most of my friends I.Qs are. I didn't take some online test, either- it was the official test. And what's your I.Q?

20090219190733AAtIn9O	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is this dress/ outfit acceptable for a pharmacology graduate school interview (with a casual nice dress code)?	My pharmacology graduate school interview is in about 2 weeks.  The dress code is casual nice and the weather will probably be hot.  Is a dress like this ok?  I’m planning on wearing the blue one.    http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...    I figure since it’s from Banana Republic, it’s probably conservative enough.  However I’m worried the dress length might be too short, specifically the slit in the middle (as displayed in the picture).  When I wear the dress and stand, the hem is 1 inch above the knee and the slit is 4 inches above the knee.  The slit is not noticeable standing, except when I walk.  However when I sit, the hem and slit hit my mid-thigh (5 inches above my knee).   Inputs anyone?  (Also, please comment if you’ve been on a graduate school’s interview panel before or if you’re a grad student or whichever walk of life your experience/ input is based on.) Thanks!

As water travels through the soil and rock, it picks up water-soluble materials and carries them along. Some of the materials in groundwater occur naturally, but many constituents in groundwater are the result of human land use activities. Different soils have different capacities to filter and absorb wastes. However, once groundwater is contaminated, it is difficult and may be impossible to clean up. When possible, cleanup is very expensive and may require many years.       In many geological formations, groundwater moves so slowly that contamination can remain undiscovered for years until the contaminated groundwater is brought to the surface by springs or wells. During that time, the pollutants can spread and contaminate large volumes of otherwise usable groundwater.       Need it TONIGHT!!!

Becoming a full professional with a graduate degree in Social Work represents the culmination of a long life of personal and professional preparation. I have so enjoyed working with people, helping them with their problems. At 34, I now feel that I have the necessary maturity to perform at my very best level, again, as a student.I now also have an especially high level of motivation that accompanies my current position working with at-risk youth, mostly minority.Frankly, I am saddened by the high incarceration rates in America, and the way that our youth lead the way going to jail, rather than college, working, etc. This sense of urgency makes me an excellent candidate for your Master's program, because I am so fully engaged with my place of employment; it is my mission, and an excellent place to complete my internship. It is my sincere hope to be able to make some modest contribution to discussions of how to best counsel and care for at risk youth, in my case my research interest is in juvenile youth, especially those at risk for spending their young adulthood behind bars. My inspiration, zeal. level of motivation, it all speaks to be graduate school as a place where I belong.      I am currently working as a youth Counselor at Harbor View Adolescent Center, a residential treatment facility, with adolescents between the ages of twelve to eighteen. Most of the adolescents encountered problems with drug and alcohol abuse, behavioral and emotional problems, and problems with the criminal justice system. In my job as a youth counselor, my primary responsibility while working with them was to serve as a positive role model. At times, my job was extremely stressful. However I discovered that I had the ability to connect with the adolescents and develop strong emotional ties with them. My main goal was to help them build their self-esteem and improve their sense of security.      There would be times that the youth would have self-injurious behavior. It was during this times that I would get stuck in knowing the what the best clinical approach to use when a child is self-harming. I would like to have better tools for helping these kids when they are in crisis, and whether those interventions are well supported by the literature.

Uncle Al was walking down the street one day, minding his own business, when he ran into his old math teacher (it wasn't me, I'm not old!!!). They started talking about the good ol' days... The subject of math class came up. His teacher asked, thinking Uncle Al would have a unique answer, what number he always said when she asked him to pick a number. She expected him to say, "Just the first number that popped into my head!" But he didn't. (Bobo might have.) He remembered her story about how people used to take numbers seriously. In fact, good numbers were even more scarce than they are today. Some of the best numbers were given names: pi, triangular numbers, perfect squares, the Fibonacci numbers, etc. One of the best numbers invented, 47, was invented by a paid numerologist.      Today, a numerologist could get rich if she came up with a really good number. The most famous numerologist of ancient times was named Archibald Medes. His good friends called him Archi. Archi was paid big bucks for creating special numbers.      One day, he was offered a million chocolate chip cookies if he could create a ten digit number which met these conditions: the first digit must tell how many zeros there are in the entire numeral, the second digit tells how many ones there are in the numeral, the third digit should tell how many twos there are in the numeral, etc. Unfortunately, Archi died of frustration because he could never find the right number. Uncle Al, feeling a craving for chocolate chip cookies (still), thought he could give it a try. He started to get frustrated, so he called on his trusty smart-people at (insert school name here) for help!         Can you show me the steps of how you solved it. i tried solving this but i can't find the right soloution.   thank you.:]

20090219215625AAprzU9	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	How do I pay for Community College with such a horrible credit rating? (read description)?	I plan on attending the Summer I term at my local Community College which begins at the end of May and lasts until the beginning of July.  The cost of this is roughly $2400 due on May 18th.   Things are bad for me right now.  I failed out of University last year and because of that the $7000 in loans I got for that are now asking me to pay them back.  I haven't made any payments on    any of these loans for almost 10 months now.  On top of that I have a lot of credit card debt which is just now being almost paid off.  So, my credit rating would be horrible I guess right?   I don't have a job currently and I owe my Stepfather almost $800.  I have to pay him back ASAP.  So when I do get a job I won't be able to start saving for CC for almost a month and half.  The   best situation I can do right now is to get a job ASAP, pay off my Stepdad by April, and maybe save up $500 for my Community College.  I'll be terribly short of the required $2400 due on May 18th.   Now, I was thinking of taking out loans to help me get that money for Community College.  But...just how am I going to do that?  Will they give me a loan after all of this trouble I have given them?   I havn't made any payments to any loans in 10 months...they will look at that and not grant me anything right?

20090219193509AAvZaGR	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you please check my grammar?	Dear Ms. 000:      I received your letter and I’m very glad to have a chance to know about you more. Now I know that you had been majoring to theatre arts and why I really liked your accents and tones when you read the book for us in class. As you said, we will be spending next few months together, so I want to introduce myself too.    At first, my favorite class is Japanese. It’s very fun that Japan and my country have a lot of similar words and traditions. Besides the Japanese, I like to learn any foreign languages because I feel so proud when somebody who speaks other language understands what I’m saying. From learning languages, I not only learn about individual person, but also about their cultures. I love traveling and that is also one of the many reasons I’m interested in learning the languages. However, I don’t really like histories and I wonder why because it’s also about learning about other countries. Probably because it sometimes conveys the conflicts, wars, and compromises and these are too complicated that makes me headache. I love the teachers in this class, though.   I’m willing to go to the 000 University one year and a few months later, so I’m preparing for the tests. If possible, I want to major in journalism since I like writing. I like when we have the writing assignments in US history class because it will later help me a lot. I will do my best in this class and in 000 high school to achieve my goal.

It is a school I'm fairly sure I can get into and I love the campus and the programs. However, I am very nervous about applying or attending because of the Jesuit affiliation. I think about 70% of the students are Catholic, and many others practice other religions. Recently the school has put up crucifixes in every classroom. I am not religious. I have no problem with religious people obviously however I'm not sure how I would fit in socially in a predominately Catholic college. Has anyone gone to BC? Or to similarly affiliated schools? What is your honest take?          There are many other schools I am looking at however BC seems to be the only one with a strong religious presence.
20090219192009AAO5lT9	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Access Course in Linguistics?	I have a few questions with regard to the Access Course.      1) I would like to do an access course in linguistics but I can't seem to find any college that offers it? Does anyone know of a course I can take where linguistics is included? If so, what is the course itself called? Or is there any course that is closely linked to the degree I want to do in the future - i.e. BA Linguistics?      2) Is there such a thing as an access course to Modern languages, such as Japanese?      3) Do colleges offer a loan for access courses or does that only apply to universities?      Basically, I only have GCSE's and taking A-level is a definite no-no to me. I'm planning on taking up Linguistics as well as Japanese later on as a degree.    I'm 20 by the way.      Has anyone got any suggestions?    Your help and advice would be greatly appreciated. :)

20090219190227AANZ0St	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Why do people give out Social Security Numbers?	I work for a company that deals with online ordering, and over the phone ordering. Usually we ask for a Name, Address and a Visa or Mastercard number to take their order with, we're very careful about shredding all the paper and we have tight internet security and whatnot.       Sometimes, a customer will need order information or something and usually all we need is a last and first name to look them up. But usually once or twice a week, people will offer me their social security number to help look them up. (This usually occurs in the pause between 'hold on a moment let me look you up' and 'how do you spell your last name' they usually ask it between there) Obviously I reassure them that all I need is there name and don't say any more on it. But like I said, this happens once or twice a week regularly, from people all across the country and from various ages.       I do know that SS numbers only started being issued to babies in the 90's and that before that, you got it when you got your drivers license. The state of Illinois gives them as medical licenses (only on certain kinds of medical licenses and I wont say which kind).      No wonder there is such an issue with identity theft, if people are just giving them out to random strangers! Do people not realize that if I were a less honest person I could take that and steal all their money or something. I mean seriously..do they not realize it..or what?      So..my question is..why would you offer someone your social security number? Especially an e-order company? Do people not know that you shouldn't give it out? What are your experiences with this and have you ever offered it to anyone but your bank?       Thanks for your answers, I'd really love some insight on this!

Anyway the phone rings and I call out and tell her but she can't hear me.  So I had one of the kids tell her.  I did not get up to answer the phone, because I wasn't really comfortable doing so.  I feel like some people want you to answer their phone and some people don't.  Until you let me know what you want...then I will follow your cue.  Do you think I was wrong for not just answering the phone in the classroom.  (I only assist for 1/2 days...everyday of the week.)  She seemed very angry that I did not do so.  She tried to cover it up, by saying to one of the kids next time answer the phone....but she was very pissed but covered it up well...but I could still tell.  Also she is pregnant about 5-6 months.  I just wasn't really thinking to be honest and also I wasn't really comfortable just going to pick up the phone....I don't know...what do you think...do you think her anger was justified...

20090219194034AAfKLgB	Education & Reference;Teaching	How do I get a teaching job with no experience, while being allowed to take classes for the credential?	I am in my fifties, male, have a college degree but never used it for work.  Now I need to make a new career.  I know there are some cities which have programs for new teachers to fill a need in the low income areas.  I read they will give intensive training, sometimes with a stipend, and then allow you to work towards your teaching credential or master's degree while teaching at the same time.  My question is how common are these situations, where are they and how do I learn of my options?  I saw one such situation advertised and they closed the application process in a few days before I even had a chance to apply.  I prefer to try teaching elementary, as the jobs tend to be in tough areas and high school seems intimidating.  Are programs like this somewhat rare, in just a few cities in the country, or would I be able to teach, without experience in most parts of the country?  Any understanding of these issues, please let me know.

A key attribute of customer service professionals is flexibility because you must always be prepared to adapt your approach to the customer and the situation. Equally, you should not speak to a senior manager at work in the same way as you would to a colleague of your own age. Sometimes at work it can be difficult to know exactly what to do and say, because some organisations expect more formality than others. Try to watch more experienced members of staff and follow their example.      thanks :)

I have the rough draft complete, which I have added to this question, but I know it is not complete. Any suggestions at this point would be awesome. Please, no negative responders!      A poor girl and a hoopty       Wow! How easy life seemed to be as I was graduating from high school. I was 18, and the first thing on my mind was getting out of my parents house. At that age, I knew it all. I wanted out of the little town I grew up in, which we called the little town of gossip.       I took off, but didn't go too far. I moved across town. I moved in with my boyfriend Kris. I didn't have anyone to pressure me about going to college, asking me where I was going, and when I would be home. Life seemed great. I was making $300 a week, and I thought that $300 a week would go so far. I bought myself a new car and was completely carefree. I didn't have a fear in the world! Life was great!       Kris and I broke up a few years later. I finally turned 21 and really thought life was fun. I was going out to bars every night of the week, met lots of fun people and had the time of my life. I had been through a few jobs here and there, but uh, no big deal. I still felt pretty good. In my eyes, life was just beginning. I was taking fun weekend vacations to the lake with my friends. I found myself easily spending my rent check on these fun weekend getaways and late nights out at the bars.        Life slowly started to sink in. The $300 a week wasn't getting me very far. I had a car payment, and my own rent to pay amoung other daily necessaties. I didn't have family to lean on during tough times. Reality of "growing up" was starting to definately sink in by this time. I had no idea how many rough times I had ahead. I ended up getting evicted from my apartment, my new car got reposessed and my $300 a week was getting garnished from my paychecks. I didn't have any idea where to turn. At 22 years old, I ended up filing for bankruptcy.       After my bankruptcy I was debt free again. My grandfather gave me a car that he had driven back and forth many years to Mexico. The car was a 93 Oldsmobile Ciera that had 300,000 miles on it. This poor car broke down every time I came to a stop. I was humiliated and nervous every time I got into that hoopty, but I was thankful for the transportation. Some where in the shuffle I called life I knew from there things had to start getting better from there.        Today, I still live in Overland Park. I have 2 beautiful daughters, who I am extremely thankful for. Looking back over the years I wish I had listened to those "grown ups" trying to teach me responsibility. All I knew was at 18 I was out of the house and I had no other concerns. My "carefree" life didn't turn out so easy. Boy, did I find out fast! I was for sure getting out of that little town that was so full of gossip!

20090219205029AAAMKGi	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Anyone great at English? could someone please proofread this paragraph for me? :) :)?	I want to make sure my grammar is on spot.  Please help? :) I'll greatly appreciate it.          Watch out folks! A popular craze is breaking through the 1920's and it is the art of dance.  Although dancing has been around centuries ago, new variations of dance have recently been making their debut throughout this decade.  America has been taken a storm by new dance moves being created in the jazz clubs, Hollywood movies, and even school gymnasiums!  Forget ballet, dancers in America are taking part in new dance crazes that are much more intimate and physical with their dance partners.  The Waltz and Tango are still impacting America greatly with new adaptations on moves.  The “Lindy Hop”, named after pilot Charles Lindburgh's first solo flight, has emerged and can be found on dance floors everywhere.  This dance move is the first to include swinging their partner in the air while jumping in tune.  It may sound dangerous but when the Lindy Hop is executed correctly, this move sure looks swell and is bound to make other couples around you balled up with envy.  Another dance move many call the epitome of the Jazz age is the “Charleston”.  You probably have seen this move because everyone is doing it!  The Charleston consists of outward heel kicks by bending and straightening the knees, creating an up and down motion to the tune of the music.  Flappers do this move best, as their beautifully beaded dresses dance along with them while they cross their hands and knees simultaneously.  Other dance moves that have been sighted recently are Foxtrots, Camel Walks, and even Square dances.  Many of these moves consist of fast paced foot work, which nicely compliments the upbeat jazz music that are blasting everywhere in clubs and from the radios.  However, the foot work is the least important when it comes to executing these dance moves correctly.  The hold, the posture of the body, the position of the arms and hands are the most important parts of making these dance moves look right.  If more people realized this, there would be fewer crazy looking couples on the dance floor.

20090219203451AAYmuMT	Education & Reference;Teaching	I am so stressed out about my senior thesis? I'm ready to cry?	I have been working my *** off with it. When I just gave my teacher the topic, which was the censorship of rock music, he said that he loved it, now, he is just giving me a bloody hard time. I stay up until 3am, working on it, I work, I have after school clubs, and I have a college class, and I am getting so stressed out. I can barely keep my eyes open in my college class, because I am exhausted. When I give him parts of my essay, he says that it's wrong, so I go fix it, and he still doesn't like it. Now, he is telling me that censorship is not an issue anymore. Why couldn't he have said that earlier? So he told me to do self-censorship. I can hardly find any information on it. I went as far as interviewing a musician in the local band, and he got mad at me for that. What does he want from me? I cannot find any current cases of censorship. What should I do? I feel like crying. I am so tired.
