Demografischen Wandels (mehr alte Menschen als junge) sicher schwer stand halten kann, die neuen Bundesl?nder werden dies ehr zu spren bekommen als die westdeutschen BL.  Ich glaube es hat sich nie wirklich jemand gefragt wie das alles funktionieren soll, weil es bis dato nichts zu Hinfragen galt, denn es hat ja funktioniert.

Gerechte Weltordnung:  Die EU und die USA versuchen mit den Subventionen die Bauern im eigenen Land vor der Globalisierung zu schtzen. Gleichzeitig werden die Lebensmittelpreise so niedrig gehalten, wovon die Verbraucher erheblich profitiert. Der Weltmarktpreis fr die Agraerzeugnisse wird dadurch so billig, dass es sich fr afrikanische Bauern nicht mehr lohnt  etwas an zu pflanzen und dies auf dem Markt zu verkaufen. Folge, der afrikanische Bauer wird nichts mehr anbauen und verarmt dadurch genauso als wenn er was anbaut.    An diesem Beispiel wird deutlich, das es gerechter w?re, wenn die Waren frei w?ren von Subventionen und es keine Handelsschranken g?be. Dann k?nnte der afrikanische Bauer sogar sein Angebautes nach Europa oder in die USA verkaufen.|`|17d2cf895242cf75355f894e57a4013aaa	Wirtschaftswachstum hei?t, das BIP (Bruttoinlandsprodukt) zu steigern.

1873a7b295c4fb415c84180a6f9ac7e3aa	Ihr k?nnte alle nicht rechnen oder Ihr lest die falschen Zeitungen.    Es gibt KEIN Klamottengeld und KEINE Extra-Leistungen fr M?bel usw. - auch das ist nur ein Gercht!!!!! Man darf zwar Gelder beantragen, aber als DARLEHEN. Man bekommt evtl. einen Zuschu? z B um eine Waschmaschine zu kaufen, vereinbarte aber gleichzeitig die Rckzahlung dieses Darlehens in Raten, die sofort mtl. von dem ALG II abgezogen werden. In den 345 Euro ist ein "angemessener" Betrag fr Kleidung enthalten. Aber z B fr Internet, Bildung, Reisen, Bewerbungskosten ist kein Betrag bercksichtigt. Es ist eine Farce!    Es ist auch ein Gercht, dass es 345 PLUS die Miete/Wohnkosten gibt. Die Medien schreiben leider alle voneinander ab und verbreiten laufend Unwahrheiten.  Die Angemessenheit der Miete oder Gr??e der Wohnung bestimmen immer noch die ?mter, und wenn die Miete "zu hoch", die NK "zu hoch", die Heizung zu teuer sind oder die Wohnung "zu gro?" ist, dann bezahlst Du die Differenz auch noch von den 345 Euro, die du zum Leben brauchst. Bei mir sind konkret Wohnkosten 337 Euro, inkl. Hzg., davon zahlt die ARGE 261 Euro plus einen kl. Betrag  Heizkostenzuschu?. Die Differenz darf ich selbst tragen. Netto-Kaltmieten sind hier am Ort 5 Euro blich, aber das schert die Beh?rde nicht. Auch nach dem neuen BSG-Urteil wonach ortsbliche Mieten zu zahlen sind, hat sich da noch nichts ge?ndert.    Von den 345 Euro zahl ich    40 Euro Wohnkosten, die die ARGE nicht tr?gt  Eine Fahrt zu meinen Eltern kostet 60 Euro (kann ich mir NICHT leisten!!!!!)  Handy-Kosten ca 40 Euro mtl.  Tel. und Internet waren bis vor kurzem 100 Euro mtl.  Seit neuestem habe ich die Flatrate von T-Com = 50 Euro mtl.  Strom 23 euro mtl.  Hinzu kommen:  Medikamentenzuzahlungen 1% des Einkommens am Anfang eines jahres, bis die 1% erfllt sind.  Ich bin chronisch krank und habe bis vor kurzem fr   Naturheilmittel und Vitamine ca 100 Euro mtl. ausgegeben.  Vitamine und Heiltees kann ich mir nur begrenzt leisten.  Ich gebe z Zt ca 50 Euro fr Gesundheitskosten aus.      Es bleiben von 345 Euro nur 20 Euro fr Lebensmittel IM MONAT brig. Nennt Ihr das LUXUS?      Man sieht an dieser Rechnung, dass NICHTS fr Bildung, Reisen, Bewerbungskosten, soziale Aktivit?ten wie Vereine, Sport usw. brig ist.  An Bewerbungskosten zahlt die ARGE nur 260 Euro im Jahr und mein Budget habe ich schon nach 3 Monaten erreicht, d. h. den Rest des Jahres darf ich von den 345 Euro auch noch Bewerbungskosten bestreiten.    Ich m?chte gerne mit denen tauschen, die eine Arbeit haben und ein Einkommen haben.

What was the outcome?    Be ready for those kinds of questions.      Stay focussed on answering the questions that they give you.  I have interviewed many people and often get answers to questions that I never asked.  The candidates get nervous, question whether they have provided enough of an answer...and then start just rambling.

Anyway, if it something important, such as documents, jewlery, art, phone etc. that you absolutely need delivered, you should use a carrier such as UPS or Fedex.  Even the ground service has tracking and insurance, so you will be able to replace them if lost, stolen or damaged.   HOWEVER, if you send cash they will NOT cover it.  In addition, if it valued at over $100, make sure it is packed well        What I mean by packed well is 2 inches of pack around the item.  IF fragile use bubble wrap and peanuts along with fragile stickers.  The reason I say all this is because if it isn't packed well and valued at over  $100, the carriers won't pay a damaged claim, only a loss claim.  Over $100, they will check to see how the item was packaged.  Hope this all helps.

1fa4c424b5a251ad07bc44cc4f4d4635aa	Hartz IV w?re dann eher angemessen, wenn man eine schnelle Chance auf einen neuen Job h?tte. Eine m?glichst geringe soziale Leistung soll ja verhindern, das Menschen sich in die soziale H?ngematte fallen lassen und liegenbleiben. Das mag ja auch sinnvoll sein - nur das ungerechte an der Sache ist, das man bei sovielen Mitbewerbern und zuwenig ad?quaten Arbeitspl?tzen nicht so schnell aus der Kiste wieder aussteigen kann, und mit diesem geringen Einkommensmittel monatelang (ber-) leben muss.  Dabei gibt es durchaus arbeitswillige, die sich immer weiter runterwirtschaften, indem sie schlechter bezahlte Jobs annehmen - und bei der n?chsten Arbeitslosigkeit noch weniger Anspruch auf Leistungen haben. Ich wurde z.B. bei dieser Gelegenheit 4 x als "berqualifiziert" rundheraus von Arbeitgebern abgelehnt - man kann also nicht selbst entscheiden, ob man einen minder qualifizierten Job annimmt - das machen noch immer die Arbeitgeber.  Eine staatliche Finanzierung von erwerblosen Zeiten, die ber dem durchschnittlichen Verdienst eines Arbeitnehmers liegt, wrde wohl noch fataleren Sozialneid durch die Arbeitenden nach sich ziehen, als die paar Hatz IV-Kr?ten - damit w?re keiner glcklich.  Vielleicht sollte man sich nach dem d?nischen Prinzip orientieren: Arbeitslosengeld auf Netto-Lohn Level, Arbeitgeber k?nnen ohne Hrde feuern - aber auch einstellen und man findet sich fr sein Leben damit ab, dass man nicht 20 Jahre im gleichen Betrieb, sondern alle paar Monate oder Jahre in einem neuen Betrieb arbeitet.

Wer als Staat so weit geht, seine eigenen Brger angeblich unter dem Deckmantel sozialer Gerechtigkeit bis ins kleinste Detail zu alimentieren, der kommt um die damit verbundenen kleinlichen und unmenschlichen  Kontrollen  nicht herum.  Neben einem aufgebl?hten Verwaltungsapparat sind Neid und  Missgunst untereinander, bis hin zur Kriminalisierung von Hilfsbedrftigen vonseiten des Staates,  die logische Folge.     Vor Hartz IV gab es bei den unterschiedlichen Stadien von Arbeitslosigkeit ja die pauschale Abgeltung fr Ansprche und Hilfsbedrftigkeit.  Dies wurde abgeschafft. Offenbar weil bestimmte Parteien und Politiker in unserem Land Spa? daran haben, am menschenverachtenden Umgang mit ihren Brgern.

Damit dann endlich dieser Neid  der Arbeitnehmer auf die Arbeitslosen aufh?rt, weil diese ja angeblich genauso viel frs Nichtstun bekommen.    Eine generelle Pauschale fr alle Arbeitslosen, w?re angebracht. Also ein Betrag den alle Arbeitslosen zur sozialen Absicherung bekommen. Ich meine damit auch, dass die Miete usw. alles von dem entsprechenden Betrag bezahlt werden kann.    Damit w?re eine erheblicher Verwaltungsakt aufgehoben, sodass man sich mal wirklich um die Vermittlung und Untersttzung kmmern kann.     Dazu kommt, dass die Leute selbst entscheiden k?nnen, wo und wie sie wohnen, also genauso als wenn sie noch eigenes Einkommen h?tten.    Wir mssen dabei bedenken, dass man arbeitslos nur eine begrentzte Zeit sein sollte. Man springt mit Arbeitlosen immer so herum, als w?ren sie generell fr immer ohne Job.    Wichtig ist auch, dass Arbeit wieder zu Leben reichen muss. Es kann nicht sein, dass so viele Leute trotz Arbeit, weiter Untersttzung brauchen, um Leben zu k?nnen.    Hier in Deutschland, muss das ganze verzwickte Steuersystem berarbeitet werden. Man k?nnte vieles mit einer Pauschale berechnen, z.B. 20% auf ALLES, aber dafr auch fr ALLE.    Eines vergessen wahrscheinlich immer noch einige; G?be es keinerlei Untersttzung, wrde die Beschaffungskriminalit?t noch extremer Ansteigen.|`|207378fc542ac2b0c7bf3079feee00dbaa	Es gibt Modelle die einen Grundlohn fr Jeden befrworten.

Letztendlich k?nnte diese dazu fhren, das der Brger sich selber entscheiden kann....    bin ich mit 800.- zufrieden und brauche nicht mehr, oder erwerbe durch Leistung mehr Einkommen dazu.

D.h. fr mich auch, es den Firmen unm?glich zu machen, Arbeitspl?tze ins billigere Ausland zu verlagern (ich bin ein Freund von Importsteuern). Dann sollte man einen Mindestlohn festlegen, damit es sich lohnt, zu arbeiten. Weiters sollte man, statt Firmen fr das Verlustmachen zu belohnen, sie fr die Schaffung von Arbeitspl?tzen (vor allem fr gering qualifizierte Arbeitnehmer) belohnen. Ja, und dann sollte man den wenigen, die tats?chlich durch jedes Raster fallen, ein halbwegs ertr?gliches Leben, aber keinen Luxus erm?glichen, und auf die Erziehung ihrer Kinder einwirken, damit sich diese Leistungsschw?che nicht fortsetzt.

Au?erdem garantiert der hohe Absatz von Ware, das die Lagerkosten gering bleiben. Natrlich sind auch die niedrigen Personalkosten ein nicht zu verachtender Punkt, aber noch entscheidener ist die so genannte Mischkalkulation, wo man einige Cent des einen Artikels nachlassen kann, welche dann z. B. auf ein Industrieprodukte gelegt werden kann, welches irgendwo sehr billig eingekauft werden kann, eben wegen der gro?en Menge und weil es nicht alt, aber auch nicht mehr das Allerneuste auf dem Markt darstellt Trotz alledem gew?hren diese Ketten dem Verbraucher neben Toppreisen auch den Service, wie Garantie u.?..|`|142c305738e39bbcace2c033ccd2fd04aa	Das liegt wohl wieder einmal nicht nur an einer Sache: Die Hauptsache jedoch drfte Aldi's Personalmanagement sein. 1-2 Verk?ufer und Kassiererinnen "schmei?en" den Laden, der oft brechend voll ist.

Die variablen Kosten sind einem Stck direkt zurechenbar - beispielsweise das Glas, der Deckel und die Gurken. Die Gemeinkosten sind alle Kosten, die nicht direkt zurechenbar sind. Beispielsweise die Maschine, die Transportkosten, die Verwaltung.    Wenn nun das Produkt einen positiven Deckungsbeitrag erwirtschaftet - der Verkaufspreis ber den variablen Kosten liegt - dann ist es immer noch fr die Industrie interessant zu produzieren. Einen Imageschaden tr?gt die Industrie nicht davon, da ja nicht der eigene Name auf dem Etikett steht sondern eine Aldi Marke.

Viele Artikel werden in so unterschiedlichen Verpackungsgr??en und in so unterschiedlicher Qualit?t angeboten, dass die Preise gar nicht vergleichbar sind.

If you don't have a hosting company or are just a beginner the steps are fairly easy:  1) Register your domain ( e.g. www.register.com or www.godaddy.com).    2) Find a web hosting company ( e.g. www.godaddy.com or yahoohosting.com or www.ipower.com) ... if you are using just HTML files it won't matter if you are using php vs. asp just make sure the hosting company supports it.     3) Uploading pages: Once you register you can look at their FAQ's if they have a "easy" upload webpage which you can point to files and images on your machine or if they require FTP to upload.    3a ...  FTP is File transfer portocol, you can actually use internet explorer now to ftp down and up files:  type in ftp://FTPSITENAME on the address bar.  You'll be asked for a login & password, and wah lah you can drag and drop files.  If you want to use ws-ftple (free FTP software) you'll have to setup where to connect to, userid & pwd to connect.  And you'll be able to upload & download files.    4) Go back to where you've registered the domain and point the name by setting up the DNS servers.  This can be a bit complicated but by searching your hosting account and where you've registered you can get the info from each on how to accomplish this.  This can take 24 to 48 hours to propagate all over the internet.    If the hosting and the name register server is one and the same e.g. the place you registered the name is where you host it ... then this step should be automatically done for you.

It is a waste of time and will cause you unhappiness.    If you choose to be suckered in and sign up to take surveys and receive, free trials considered you were warned. The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.    A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!    Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two. The survey business is not an efficient way to make money and you are more than likely to loose money in the end.|`|a228c3689ece9fc46ee221dc9499004eaa	What about working online at home.

Good luck!|`|f67bf2f970cdc18b147c58680eff9190aa	Well, personally I would go for the UK. Actually I lived in the UK. My husband is actually from the UK. He moved here and the permit for took longer then 6 months and INS took forever. Immigration is slow here in the US. I don't believe it's great. However, it depends on the type of job you have in the US (are u working llegally) if you don't have a permit? but if you have no job in the UK but a work permit. I am sure you could find job easily there. Besides, here in the US they are pretty strict on those who don't have permits (unless you work fast food-or restauraunt) industry. It sounds to me though either way they are pretty much the same if neither one is your country, and you don't have relatives..besides same ratio of pay...I would live in the UK...that's another question itself.

cf52d5b7258b5e6562c150bb61df7b2faa	Learn the difference between want and need.  In today's world, at least in the U.S., most people don't know the difference.  Don't spend your money on things you don't need.  DO NOT get an interest only, or variable rate mortgage.  As they reset, tens of thousands of people are about to loose their homes for doing this.  Make sure you can afford the payments WITHOUT using creative financing to get your foot in the door.  The larger percentage you put down, the lower your monthly payments.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Open a savings account and if where you work has 401K, start a minimum investment into that. Set yourself a maximum to put into savings, even if it's a week where you can't really afford it, have it deducted from your check automatically, and write it off off your budget as a regular bill or as if you were paying for another car. The more you save, the less your payments will be once you purchase, so don't get discouraged if it takes you a while to save it up. I would suggest at least 1/3 of the cash price of the house down or more if you can swing it and remember that once you start this account, that this money doesn't exist. If you have any financial burdons, deal with them as best you can and don't touch that savings. This day and time, it's the only way to make it and once you buy the home, you may have to cut back on the amount you are putting into savings, but continue putting money into it and the 401K. You won't be sorry you did later on when retirement time comes along. You could also put some of the savings once you reach $2,000.00 into an IRA with your bank. IRA's have higher interest rates and as long as the money remains in the IRA account the government can't tax you on the money, but there is one drawback to an IRA. If you go to pull the any of the cash out before 7 years, the government taxes you on it, so as far as IRA's are concerned, this would be money that you would be keeping for retirement as opposed to going towards a house. Good luck.|`|AA12337032	It will take a while but u can put like 10% away each pay chech till u guys are ready to pay a home..   and as for the down payment u need 20% = 30,000|`|7T7P5yaPaa	Depending on where you live, there are markets in the U.S. where you need very little down to buy a house - in some cases, you need nothing to buy a new home!  I purchased my home in the Phoenix area 3 years ago, and for $2K down.  Las Vegas and Phoenix are the best housing markets, as far as pricing and employment goes.      Don't use credit cards.

The worst mistake you could do (aside from taking a "hot stock tip" from a stranger) is to chase after the next booming market.  Just decide where you want to live and find yourself a compitent and experienced Realtor.  They will guide you to the lenders that still offer 100% financing programs.  They will write up an offer that has the seller's paying the closing costs.  I am not yet 30 years old and will be buying my 3rd house shortly and have never paid closing costs and never had a down payment.  My next house will have a 30 yr fixed rate below 6% APR.

They're about to do some amazing things soon.|`|rkEOMr6Haa	First time home buyers often don't need any money down, maybe just closing costs.  There are dozens of programs to help first time home buyers, many are local. Real estate sales are down and lenders are competing for business.  It's a buyer's market right now.      Go talk to a loan officer or two, and see what they say.  Tell them you would like to get pre-approved for a loan to buy a home.  They will tell you what you are qualified for and how much the down payment would be.  It varies everywhere so shop around.  You are paying rent anyway, why not build equity?    Generally lenders want your total monthly housing costs (principle, insurance, taxes, interest) to be approximately 36% of your gross (pre-tax) income or less.  This may vary, some lenders have strict guidlines and others may allow up to 45% possibly more.    If you need a down payment and want to save, CD's are a good option.  They pay decent interest and don't tie your money up for a long time.  Rate riser CD's are good if you don't know when you will need the money.  It gives you the option to cash out or let the interest grow in regularly scheduled intervals.  Good luck.

AA12330533	To set up an ecommerce website you will need the following:    1) A website. I know this sounds silly but there is a lot more to it then most people understand. To have a website you will need to register a domain name and get web hosting. Then you will need someone to design and build your website for you. Naturally having a website that looks professional and is pleasing to the eye can help you convert lookers into buyers.    2) You will need a shopping cart. A shopping cart will allow you to manage your products and orders. There are many free and paid ones available and they offer many different features. You can also have a custom one made for you by a web developer. The advantages of using an existing script is that your site can get up faster and it costs less then a custom cart. The downside is you have to use what they give you and may have limited customization capabilities.    3) An SSL certificate. This allows for you to secure your order page will is necessary so your customers' sensitive data (credit card information) is protected from thieves. You can get them cheaply at godaddy.com.    4) A merchant account. This is what will allow you to accept credit card payments. There are lot of merchant account providers out there so make sure you shop around as their rates will vary. Naturally lower rates are better. For an Internet business do your best to get rates as close to 2.00% as possible.    5) A payment gateway. This connects your shopping cart and order form to your merchant account. Basically it acts just like a credit card machine does in a retail store. The most popular gateway is Authorize.Net.    Some companies can actually provide all five services for you. Or you can choose to get them separately and try to save money or get exactly what you want feature-wise.|`|86ebe5fe7155f0fddc00d7ab901eb892aa	if you go to www.authorize.net and snoop around you'll find a very helpful diagram that shows how all the pieces fit together. High level thoughts:    Merchant Account - In business, not just online, this is what allows you to accept credit cards.    Payment Gateway - This is the 3rd party that takes your transactions and does everything necessary to get them into the interchange network. This can include authorization as well as submission for settlement. Without the gateway, your online transactions cannot "get into" the interchange network for processing.

kL41a5Bnaa	Paypal is basicaly an online bank.     the "internet money" is money that you supply to it via check/savings account. they may accept checks i dont know though.     when you buy something and use paypal they withdrawl it from your paypal account. if you don't ahve money in your paypal account then they withdrawl it from your checking or savings account.       when you sell soemthing and get paid via paypal you may transfer it into your bank account.|`|4aec7c9dccb269d898f2dd11b4622ed3aa	You need to connect your bank account to paypal.

You can also receive a check, apply for a paypal debit card (which the money is taken out of your paypal account, and you get 1% cash back), or you can use the money at any website that accepts paypal. Paypal also takes a percentage of each sale (I think 2.9%) so when you're selling something take this into consideration. Good luck!|`|biMINS1Eaa	1. When you earn money via selling items on eBay, the buyer can simply transfer money from his paypal account to yours.  You don't need checks or anything like that.    2. You can buy things on the internet with the money in your paypal account.  You will need to verify your PayPal account though, before you can buy things.  You can do that by either adding a credit card, bank account, or getting a PayPal credit card.    3. I really don't suggest PayPal, there are alternatives, like money orders, or cash payments through eBay.  myself, along with 90% of people I have talked to, have someway or another along the road, been scammed, ripped off, or mistreated by eBay.  It's safe to say PayPal is safe, but they are very devious.  Most times if they try to screw you over, you can send them an email about what they are doing.  I recently almost got lost over 200 $ from my account, but simply sent them a threatening email saying it was against the law (which it was, paypal states it HAS to operate like a normal bank) and got my money back.    If you are willing to take the gamble of opening your own account, go ahead, It may be far worth the gamble.

There are operations out there that use innocent 3rd parties to clean stolen money this way and there could be criminal and civil liabilities for your participation.|`|Y32zA5Mfaa	This sounds exactly like the most recent SCAMS.  Have you tried cashing the check?  If it is a scam, what will happen is: you will cash the check.  You will send 1/2 the money to the "nanny".  You will keep 1/2 the cash.  The check will be counterfeit.  You will be responsible for giving back the money to the bank.  However, now you will only have 1/2 the money (since you sent the other 1/2 to the "nanny").  Now, in essence, you have given the scammers $1,745.00 of your OWN money.    DO NOT DO IT!!!  This sounds exactly like the scams that are being warned about all over the news.  If you have cashed the check, I definitely would hang on to all of it until you hear from the bank (contact them right away and let them know the situation).  Chances are you will be having to give it back to the bank soon.  If you have not cashed the check, I would HIGHLY recommend not doing so.  Just rip it up.    If they were being sincere, they would have given you phone numbers by now.  Why would they send a complete stranger money when they have no way of getting hold of you?      Good luck!    EDIT: Oh, quite definitely this is a scam.  Have you cashed the check?  Talk to your bank right away if you have!  Don't send any money at all!!!  You will be required to pay back the money when the check comes back counterfeit.      Also, is there somewhere on craigslist you can report people?  You should report this, because I bet they are going after lots of people with this scam!  Perhaps to the police, too.    If you have already sent the money, then all you can do is go to the police with your information.  You won't get your money back, but hopefully they can report this information somewhere and try to catch the people.|`|i6gBYyl0aa	Yes, it is a scam. The scam is that you deposit the check in your account, send the "nanny" her portion of the cash. The check will turn out to be bad and you will be out the money you sent the "nanny."
fR2Geezcaa	Odds are if or when they find out you had a previous WC claim they will probably find some reason to not hire you or to let you go.     If you applied for the same exact work that aggravated your health condition and caused you to file a claim to begin with and you have an on-going claim, you probably just lost your WC too.|`|AHCelSY1aa	Well rule of thumb is all records are kept for a minimum of 1 year although it is not unheard of that some organizations keep them longer especially in your particular case there was a WC claim and deposition.  You can take the chance they will rehire you, but do not be surprised if they do not.  If this company were a client where I work we would advise them against it and then it would be a matter of you proving this is in fact what happened which is virtually impossible.|`|GLnVPp2Caa	Seems like that the claim would be in your HR file...|`|mTwn8p79aa	Your workman's comp claim will certainly still be on a computer somewhere.  If nowhere else, it will be in their insurance company's system.    Sounds like you left on pretty bad terms, I wouldn't hold my breath--or depending on what the health risk is, maybe you should hold it the whole time you're in the building.
0yqQg9CXaa	ALL credit reporting agencies have different scores.  And to top it all of Experian has just changed their grading scale.  Used to reach 850 tops, now people with normal credit are getting 990 scores.  There is so much demand for higher scales (the higher the scale the more money they make) that companies are chaging.    Mortgage companies do not focus on the scores.  They review your reports in detail and make their own decisions.  At least that gives you some comfort that scores are not that important - YOUR REPORTS ARE.  Keep them clean and pristine.  And know how to do it.  /|`|7QPv7ta7aa	First, why in the world would you waste money on not one, but two credit monitoring services?  They are a complete waste of money.   Cancel both services and use the money to pay on your debts.    Second, most third party monitoring services use they own scoring method, referred to as Fakko.  TransUnion and Experian will sell you Vantage (scale goes to 990 vs FICO's 850).  Bascially, you are comparing apples and oranges.    Creditors use FICO.  If you want your real, up-to-date FICO scores for all three credit bureaus, go to MyFico.com.    But most importantly, don't obsess over your score.  Pay your bills on time and check your credit report annually for accuracy.  You score will take care of itself.  In your case, you probably need about 24 months of consistent, on time payment to see any real improvement in those credit scores.

If you mean is it highly demanding as in stressful and time consuming, then the answer is also yes.  It is a profession that often requires you to be doing multiple things at once and sometimes drop what you're in the middle of to attend to an emergency.

But as the company lost billions of pounds and had it of not been for taxpayers money they would have gone bust and the 170,000 staff would have been made redundant I frankly think that this year it takes the piss and there should be no bonus this year.|`|AA11433998	If it was the staff that worked with the public, I wouldn't mind as much but the fact that it is the crooks and theives that ran RBS into the ground getting obscene amounts is what disgusts me.    Surely a bonus should only be given if you were doing a good job!|`|8BWbaHQUaa	Yes. There will be many people that work very hard at RBS (cashiers, accountants, advisors and so on) who have nothing to do with the problems the bank got into.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	You have several problems, none that are that major individually but together are causing you to have a lower score.    First you have 1 credit card and are over 50% of your limit.  Generally you need to not use more than 30% of your total credit limit.  The higher you go above that the more it hurts your score.  When you get to about 85-90% of your limit you are considered "maxed out" and that really hurts your score.  So work on getting that limit down    The second is the late payments.  If these were reported as late(at least 30 days), the only thing that will help this is time.  As time goes on your older events have less of an effect.  So as long as you do not become late again these will eventually have very little effect.    Once you get these under control attempt to get additional credit.  This could include a credit card.  The important thing here is to use it responsibly.  Ideally use it for purchases you would pay cash for and then pay off the balance every month.|`|qtHFJFvQaa	^^^ I 2nd that ^^^|`|C0tYtelFaa	Your late payments seem to be really haunting you right now as well as the credit card debt being within 50% of the limit...    You are moving in the right direction, but I would advise you to request re-aging of your obligations as a courtesy to you (on your car loan and student loans)... Some companies will be willing to do so if you keep up a good payment track record.  You will need to reach out to some of the senior levels of the company to have that request pushed through.    Other than that, as long as you keep your utilization of credit low, do not make too many inquiries, and work to getting your credit accounts re-aged, you will see a gradual, if not immediate improvement of your score..    Feel free to send me an e-mail if you need further help..|`|meK0ziCJaa	I agree with most of the previous posters. Late payments are a bummer on your credit score. It sounds like you've had a few, so there's the reasons for the lower score than you would like. Keep paying all of your bills on time.     I would keep paying as much as you can on your credit card until it's paid off. I wouldn't apply for new credit at the moment as you most likely won't qualify for the lowest terms available, and the given credit crunch.    The key is to maintain the accounts you have right now. It never hurts to ask your creditors to reverse a late payment or two. You never know what they are going to say, but it kind of depends on how late the payment was. You could also dispute the trade line on your credit file. If the creditor does not respond and close the dispute within 30 days, the negative mark should be removed from your credit file. However, this is a shot in the dark.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	You keep paying on time, every time.  Every debt.  Only a record of on-time payments will raise your score and it is a gradual process.

You have to be specially trained to do this, and have a degree or certificate to work in this area of healthcare.|`|I2yzUID0aa	I have nothing to do with billing, but I do coding for a physicians office.

It gives your company a goal to reach, and especially to be able afford the expenses when they inevitably always rise the following year.      If you numbers from last year, the year before that, and the year before that, etc. are all over the board (hi, low, hi, low), it may not be a bad idea to start with "zero based budgeting".|`|AA10298566	First list all income. Then keep track of all outgoing cash to the penny for at least 1 whole month, make a list of all exspenses by priority(ie rent/mortgage,electric,water,food,phone ect) write the dollar amount beside each item subtacting from income untill each NEED is covered. Then prioritize the other bills(ie cable,cellphone,internet,cc's ect) and repeat. If you have $$ left at the end of both lists pay off highest inetrest nonsecured debt with remaining $$$. If no nosecured debit pay off car notes. If no car notes start "Contingency funds" to pay for non-regular items such as christmas/vacation/new roof/new car/ect with 1/2 money and place other 1/2 in intrest bearing savings account untill you have 10,000.00 in account then start investing with new savings.

U0KCmsKXaa	If you have everything in writing including an e-mail from your boss acknowleding the time off, that's really all you need.  Show copies of everything to your boss first, and if he still wants to fire you then tell him you are going to take legal action.|`|fR2Geezcaa	Read you employee handbook. Most company's put "at will" employment, which means they can let you go and they do not have to give you any reason why.    Poor attendance is usually the main reason people lose their jobs. I would be humble about proving your boss wrong and assure him how important your job is to you (yes, it is time to butt kiss). Don't approach it with an attitude, you won't win, not if he is already on you for something he pre-approved.    Either way, it is your "over-all attendance" that will/would be looked at if you have to sign up for unemployment or even think about a wrong full discharge case.|`|AHCelSY1aa	I don't understand.  If you have this in email why didn't you show it to him to prove he did in fact approve the time off?  Additionally, that's alot of time off.  10 days plus an additional 1 1/2 days?  I think you pushed it that's what happened.  During your absence obviously something happened and you are the scape goat.  You have no legal grounds whatsoever.  At most you can just show your boss the mail and prove he had in fact approved it.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Like you said, it's an at will company.  They could just change their mind and decide they need you during the time you asked to have off.  Can't do it?  Hmm, sorry, we'll have to let you go.    I hope everything besides the vacation situation is fantastic at that job because they certainly seem to be taking advantage of someone who asks for a day and a half off every two years.  I'd leave.  McDonald's treats their part time managers much better than this.
qWaYbxcxaa	Yes, if you are short a stock and hold the trade even to the 1st trade on the the ex-div date, you would be paying someone else that div.

kGJND4lYaa	Actually an estate tax is not placed on the transfer of property, it's placed on the property held by the dead person, regardless of whether it is transferred or not.    There is no estate tax in Canada.    There is however a "deemed disposition" of all the assets of the deceased, meaning all assets are "deemed to be sold" and immediately reacquired at fair market value on the date of death.    This usually results in capital gain, and therefore capital gains tax on the last tax return of the dead person.|`|NsbGM74iaa	Yes you are correct.  It is a federal and state tax of someones net assets when they die.  Federally, there is a high amount of estate that you can exclude from the tax (over $1Million)|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Yes, that is what estate tax represents.

I would estimate your tax liability at 26000$ to be around 5500. this includes about 2200$ for CPP that you would have to pay. However if your operating a business you would only be taxed on your "net" profit. meaning if you made 26000$ gross and then subtracted your expenses your tax liability would greatly decrease. The legal liabilities in a sole proprietorship go beyond the scope of this response.
fR2Geezcaa	Bottom line is she was to follow protocol. Her case will be hard to prove as a wrongful discharge. They do sound like they/he are in the wrong and it couldn't hurt to speak to an attorney. Just make sure it is one that takes the case only were he is paid if she wins.    If the company and/or her boss were reputable they would have given her insurance, as promised. This may all be coming from the waves she made about her insurance and the fact that she is pregnant now. Sounds like her boss screwed up and he knows it. Trying to get her on the insurance now would get corporates attention on her boss. It is a difficult to get an employee on insurance after the fact. Normally someone as to be to blame for dropping the ball and her boss would be the target of that finger pointing!|`|3mAgM405aa	Since your sister was a "trainer," and her boss was not in the loop when she provided the advice to a franchisee, he's the real person who should settle this dispute unless he's willing to sacrifice your sister for his lack of instructions about what is okay to say to franchisees.  And if the manager is fired for lack of controls, he will not be able to follow through with any healthcare promises made to your sister which ultimately comes from the Corporation.    I would highly recommend that you review any and all written agreements and oral understandings made between your sister and her immediate boss/manager to ensure that there are clear cut directions given or limiting your sister's training advice, especially given without direct supervision by her boss.  And if there is no clear cut restrictions or limitations, then in a sense, anhything goes ... and perhaps your sister at this stage, should be looking for another job and have in hand, a better written employment contract or a better understanding of what she can or cannot say as a trainer to franchisees.    Good luck!|`|AHCelSY1aa	Unfortunately no wrongful termination.  If I had a nickel for every person who walks into our office with that very situation I would be rich.  Now as for the health insurance.  Are you saying they promised to keep her on the policy at there expense?  Because once a person is terminated or resigns by law they MUST be offered COBRA where the person pays for it out of pocket.  As for unemployment she is definitely eligible since she was terminated.  Are you saying she hasn't filed?  One thing I would certainly not mention though is the pregnancy when she files since you must be ready, willing and able to work.  She may get an a**hole claims investigator who may view her pregnancy as a hinderance to gaining employment.|`|AA10620246	If your sister was working at-will, she, or the company, had the right to terminate her employment any time they see fit. If she tried to sue them, they would have a paper trail, and people who would testify that her job performance was unsatisfactory.    As far as unemployment, she is certainly welcome to file. However, if her former employer decides to fight it, her claim may very well be denied.|`|T8f8C3Tfaa	Its not wrongful termination.  She was fired, that's it.  Let it go.    I honestly think that there is more to this story but its employment at will then they can terminate without notice anytime they wish for any reason.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Sorry, not following protocol is a fine reason for termination.

AA10072911	If the collections are coming to your house under a different name then I wouldn't respond. Don't even open the envelopes, just write "No such person at this address" on the envelope and put it back in your mailbox and raise the flag. If you write the collection agency they might add your name to the account and change the current name on the collection to an alias of yours.    Keep a close eye on your credit report. If you notice the collections appear then write to the credit bureau and dispute the account as not belonging to you. If you run into problems just send the credit bureau a copy of the police report stating that you do not go by the other name and they will remove it from your report.

You've got an extremely familiar situation and there's not a lot you can do, it's just part of the "team" atmosphere.  The other problems you've got are just part of working for an employer that doesn't care about it's employees.    I'd skip talking to the boss that clearly can't follow through with anything and go to HR and file a complaint about the other supervisor's behavior.  There's never an appropriate time to raise your voice with another employee--well maybe if they fire up one of the power tools while you're talking but I digress.  His behavior is inappropriate and shouldn't be tolerated.  It's a bad enough work environment right now with everyone looking for fewer people to do more and more work.

If you quit you probably will not get unemployment.    If you think no job is better than the situation you are in now then quit.  Otherwise suck it up & do the work.  We all have had bad bosses.

Corporate bonds are a good buy because they will pay a fixed level of interest until maturity this adds stability to a  portfolio.

qWaYbxcxaa	Based on your statements here, the answer would be, no, you have no recourse.     As long as GM or the dealer did not manage your 401(k), and they did not chose your investments for you.     What GM / (the dealership) had to do is comply with ERISA especially when it comes to education on 401(k)'s investment choices. This is usually handle by an outside firm. The dealer is not an investment advisor and thus cannot advise one way or the other. This is how they avoid liability.    ERISA  http://www.erisa.com/    The best chance to argue an ERISA case is prove some violation of ERISA. I can tell you that you prob won't find a lawyer who will take a case for someone who lost only $10 grand. He or she will say something like, "is that all...everyone (almost everyone) lost money last year."     Even the USGov, the FDIC and the FED is sitting on $ billions in paper losses from buying bank stock and pfd stock last year. We should have learned by now, that the USG is not a financial expert    For your case, you would also best need a specialist, an ERISA legal expert. This will cost far more than $10K. And if the DLR is BK, you would prob get 0 anyway.     You could go after the plan custodian. But, if you have no legal expert, and no case, you are going up against in house financial and legal experts who will run circles around most people.    An ERISA violation could be if there was no safe investment such as cash/ money market ("a stable cash fund"). If this option was not available to you, then I would say you have a good case.  However it is up to you to make the trading decision and move the money to cash if that is what you think you should have done, before the market fell.     Hindsight is always 20/20.     I have tried to help over 3500 people for free on Y!A over the last 2 years as I said this mess would unfold, albeit worse than I expected. (see post history. add me to view).    Hope your injury gets better soon. You will prob recover faster then the 401(k).    IF, I were to give advice, my advice on Y!A has consistently been to seek a professional financial advisor with 15+ years of real market (trading) experience to help you with your retirement assets. You want someone who understands markets, and does not just say, oh investment for the long run.    If the dealership is out of business, you might want to consider rolling those funds either "in kind" (keep the same funds), in cash,  or as you think is necessary to a IRA Rollover. Contact the custodian and a personal advisor for more help.      Good Luck!|`|UDxL7lPqaa	The dealership never managed your 401(k) plan.  You did - with the third-party fund custodian.|`|JsHG73v9aa	It's really sad, but unfortunately you really have no recourse.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	Don't you personally manage what you are invested in in a 401k?|`|GJKWgx0Paa	not likely you'd win, nor that there is any money to collect if you did.    ***  where in the 401(k) agreement does it say that they agree to provide any more than the normal management the mutual fund itself provides?      ---  there's a bare chance that a very sharp lawyer might make a case that the 401(k) agreement is at fault if it restricts you from managing the choice of funds in ways that are arbitrary and/or capricious to the point of causing harm.    of course, that same very sharp lawyer would need to see millions at stake in a class action suit for it to be worth his while to take the case.    ***  oh.

Here's a news release on the proposal.    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Wednesday, February 4, 2009     Senate Unanimously Approves Isakson Amendment to Stimulate Housing Market  Homebuyer Tax Credit Revived Market in 1975 and Would Work Today    WASHINGTON  The U.S. Senate today unanimously approved an amendment by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., to stimulate the nations declining housing market by offering a $15,000 tax credit to individuals who purchase a home in the next year.     It is time to fix Americas problem, not throw money at the symptoms. It is time to fix housing first. It is rare that we have a road map to success in times of difficulty, but this country has once before realized a housing crisis every bit as bad as the one we have today and economic troubles every bit as dangerous, Isakson said. We have a pervasive housing problem, and we have a historical precedent that works. I am proud this Senate has joined together, learned from history and repeated a method that worked by adopting this amendment.     Specifically, Isaksons amendment to the pending economic stimulus bill would provide a direct tax credit to any homebuyer who purchases any home. The amount of the tax credit would be $15,000 or 10 percent of the purchase price, whichever is less. Purchases must be made within one year of the legislations enactment, and the tax credit would not have to be repaid.     The amendment would allow taxpayers to claim the credit on their 2008 income tax return. It also seeks to prevent misuse by only allowing purchases of a principle residence and by recapturing the credit if the home is sold within two years of purchase. The amendment would sunset the current $7,500 housing tax credit on the date of enactment.     Isakson has pushed hard for a non-repayable tax credit for homebuyers because he knows that it will work. In the mid-1970s, America faced a similar housing crisis when a period of easy credit and loose underwriting flooded the market with new construction.  Interest rates rose, the economy slowed and America was left with a three-year supply of vacant homes. Congress responded by passing a $2,000 tax credit for anyone purchasing a new home for their principal residence. Isakson believes the results were clear and swift as home values stabilized, housing inventory dropped and the market recovered.     Last year, Isakson introduced legislation to specifically target those homes that were causing the unprecedented increase in housing inventory by offering tax credits to individuals purchasing a foreclosed home or a home where foreclosure is pending. In April 2008, the Senate passed legislation to stimulate the nations declining housing market that included Isaksons proposal. However, the final version of the legislation that was signed into law included only a $7,500 tax credit for first-time homebuyers that must be repaid over a 15-year period. Isaksons amendment that passed today would sunset that $7,500 tax credit.     Isakson spent more than three decades in the real estate business, beginning his business career in 1967 when he opened the first Cobb County, Ga., office of a small, family-owned real estate business, Northside Realty. Isakson later served as president of Northside for 20 years, presiding over the companys growth into the largest independent residential real estate brokerage company in the Southeast and one of the largest in America.     Isakson has not made a decision regarding his vote on the overall economic stimulus legislation.        |`|jCjkSnAtaa	The proposal allows for the purchase (not refinance) of a residential owner occupied property by anyone that purchases in 2009. Very specifically, it is pointed out that it cannot be used for investment properties. I disagree with the point that it would raise the price of houses by $15K. This is not costing the sellers anything directly. It may jumpstart the housing in any given area, and the supply and demand factor may cause prices to go up. However, there are still a lot of great deals out there, and a lot of inventory to burn up.
ODf41iN4aa	I only know what I read in the morning paper.  It said Nov thru Dec '09.  I immediately asked, "November of WHAT YEAR?" but the newspaper did not speak.  Can only assume it meant houses purchased from Nov '08 thru Dec '09.  So, it doesn't sound like it's retroactive back beyond Nov. of presumably '08.  Also, there were other details & income requirements, but I don't remember it all.  I don't usually bring the newspaper to work.  Maybe all the realtors will tell us the answer soon, or maybe Clark Howard's consumer advice website will have something, if not this minute, then sometime soon.  I may buy a house in the coming year as a first time homebuyer, but I'm not sure.   The credit will certainly not be the deciding factor.  If I buy a house, then I'll find out, or maybe we'll all learn it on YA.      I think this thing went thru the House or Senate or both.  Somebody had to pass it, or maybe Obama can pass certain things himself.  (I shouldn't have spaced out in h.s. government classes.  I was easily mentally distractible in h.s.)  We could probably learn the scoop by searching online for their proceedings, or we can just look for online news stories.

If none of these are available, if you check with the PBGC, they may be able to help as they have pension information for "lost" participants.  Additionally, you can check with SSA to see if the Plan has been reporting you as having a benefit and being separated from service.

A company makiing a differents,,,,petro canada....do you support this?  Petro-Canada to Sponsor Project Homeless Connect for 2009      11:57 AM ET, February 5, 2009      CALGARY, ALBERTA, Feb 5, 2009 (Marketwire via COMTEX) -- Hundreds of homeless or near-homeless Calgarians will receive needed support through Project Homeless Connect (PHC) in 2009 due to the financial and in-kind support of Petro-Canada.     "Petro-Canada is pleased to be able to help Project Homeless Connect," said Ron Brenneman, Petro-Canada's president and chief executive officer. "This is a practical and immediate way to help the growing number of homeless in Calgary."     PHC is a one-day event, to be held four times in 2009, where homeless or near-homeless individuals and families are provided with many services in one location. On-site access to materials and services include: medical treatment, counseling, housing, new identification documents, income support, employment and education opportunities. In addition, hair-cuts, meals, clothing and comfort kits containing personal items are provided.     "We are thrilled to have Petro-Canada's support for Project Homeless Connect," said Tim Richter, President and CEO of the Calgary Homeless Foundation. "With Petro-Canada's investment, as well as their direct participation in staging the four editions of PHC in 2009, the Homeless Foundation has a strong partner in helping provide much needed resources and supports to homeless and near-homeless Calgarians."     PHC events for 2009 will take place between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at the Petro-Canada Centre, 150 - 6th Avenue SW, Calgary, on February 28, May 23, September 19 and November 23.     Project Homeless Connect (PHC) in Calgary     The Calgary Homeless Foundation organized and hosted Calgary's first PHC on April 26, 2008, serving 650 people.

oFiGyMWraa	The mortgage company are most bothered about whether you have enough money to make the payments each month. If you have given the correct monthly outgoing for this loan then you have given them the most important piece of information.    However, they will take a dim view of any dishonesty, because they will assume that you might also be lying about other things.    The amounts are small enough that you would probably get away with claiming it was a genuine mistake. Alternatively, I assume that 2700 is what you originally borrowed? What is the current outstanding amount? If its somewhere near 1400 you could claim thats you were supplying the actual current debt.    Just noticed that your husband does not know about the extra 1000 on the loan. Everything I said above still applies to what you tell the mortgage company. But if you are planning a "huge" mortgage with your husband you need to be honest with him first. He's bound to find out sooner or later, and it will be a whole lot better if you tell him. If its such a major problem that is can't be sorted don't you think you are better off not getting yourself tied into a big mortgage?|`|AA11908567	The credit check will know you are lying.

He put it in and it said I could borrow 68K.

eaffc43f263810b603ea7747f335734eaa	I agree with Resasour. I would like to add though that my feeling on the subject is that if you can afford to go out, you can afford the babysitter.  Therefore, everyone should be charged the same amount.  I always paid my babysitters more if they were to prepare a meal or to change a diaper or two. So it definitely is dependent on the age of the child and the type of care involved as well as extra duties that are above & beyond simply watching the children.  I also paid more because my children had medical issues that needed to be attended to, so that is definitely a consideration when she is charging her customers.  Another tip, because all of my children are old enough to babysit, is to make it clear to the customer exactly what you expect to be paid BEFORE going over there.  That way, there are no misunderstandings at the end of the night, and the parents will then budget ahead of time to have that much money left over at the end of the night, as well as to have the proper amount of cash on them when they arrive home.|`|AA11841705	that depends on many factors... how old is your daughter, what type of customers is she likely to have? call the local day care centers in your area and find out how they charge... from infants to say 12yrs, find out what they would charge for 8 hrs and 40 hrs per child... she should know what the cost is for school age children (as she is likely to only have them a few hours a day) and what full time care would cost for children not in school..  then she should figure her average charges based on about 1/2 of what they charge... a little more if she has to provide meals or overnights...  assuming she isnt a licensed day care professional...|`|f4374167de41fd16512df23372c3609daa	base you charge on the average daycare and after school program in your community.

Here's a news release on the proposal:    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Wednesday, February 4, 2009     Senate Unanimously Approves Isakson Amendment to Stimulate Housing Market  Homebuyer Tax Credit Revived Market in 1975 and Would Work Today    WASHINGTON  The U.S. Senate today unanimously approved an amendment by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., to stimulate the nations declining housing market by offering a $15,000 tax credit to individuals who purchase a home in the next year.     It is time to fix Americas problem, not throw money at the symptoms. It is time to fix housing first. It is rare that we have a road map to success in times of difficulty, but this country has once before realized a housing crisis every bit as bad as the one we have today and economic troubles every bit as dangerous, Isakson said. We have a pervasive housing problem, and we have a historical precedent that works. I am proud this Senate has joined together, learned from history and repeated a method that worked by adopting this amendment.     Specifically, Isaksons amendment to the pending economic stimulus bill would provide a direct tax credit to any homebuyer who purchases any home. The amount of the tax credit would be $15,000 or 10 percent of the purchase price, whichever is less. Purchases must be made within one year of the legislations enactment, and the tax credit would not have to be repaid.     The amendment would allow taxpayers to claim the credit on their 2008 income tax return. It also seeks to prevent misuse by only allowing purchases of a principle residence and by recapturing the credit if the home is sold within two years of purchase. The amendment would sunset the current $7,500 housing tax credit on the date of enactment.     Isakson has pushed hard for a non-repayable tax credit for homebuyers because he knows that it will work. In the mid-1970s, America faced a similar housing crisis when a period of easy credit and loose underwriting flooded the market with new construction.  Interest rates rose, the economy slowed and America was left with a three-year supply of vacant homes. Congress responded by passing a $2,000 tax credit for anyone purchasing a new home for their principal residence. Isakson believes the results were clear and swift as home values stabilized, housing inventory dropped and the market recovered.     Last year, Isakson introduced legislation to specifically target those homes that were causing the unprecedented increase in housing inventory by offering tax credits to individuals purchasing a foreclosed home or a home where foreclosure is pending. In April 2008, the Senate passed legislation to stimulate the nations declining housing market that included Isaksons proposal. However, the final version of the legislation that was signed into law included only a $7,500 tax credit for first-time homebuyers that must be repaid over a 15-year period. Isaksons amendment that passed today would sunset that $7,500 tax credit.     Isakson spent more than three decades in the real estate business, beginning his business career in 1967 when he opened the first Cobb County, Ga., office of a small, family-owned real estate business, Northside Realty. Isakson later served as president of Northside for 20 years, presiding over the companys growth into the largest independent residential real estate brokerage company in the Southeast and one of the largest in America.     Isakson has not made a decision regarding his vote on the overall economic stimulus legislation.        |`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	It's not a grant, it's also not automatic.

But if she is giong to pay for the 4 yrs of college take it and while you are at it do the vet tech job part time and see if its really what you want to do. If you take the college courses you can always have something to lean on if the vet tech doesn't work out. Every job is an honorable job so don't worry about that second class stuff. She would get over it.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	i agree. it was my fun job for awhile,then i grew up. if you like pets,become a vet. not someone who cleans up poop. i loved working there as well.|`|7idLr1Rxaa	If you want to work with animals and have the brains and parents to back it why don't you become a veterinarian? It obviously takes much longer but maybe your mom would support you becoming a vet tech, then doing your pre-med and going to vet school. If she knows you are aspiring to be a doctor than she will definetley be proud. If you are a vet tech while in college to become a veterinarian you will already be ahead of the curve because you would have real experience-something you can't get from any book.|`|e4SYY17daa	ach, that's the worst. I totally know how you feel though. :(    I had a breakdown because my parents had been putting so much pressure on me to do well in school so I could be a doctor or something ("Mary! Put those brains of yours to use!") but all I really want to do after high school is write. I had a talk with her in the car on our way out of town and I just said "I want to be an author."     She took it a lot better than I thought she would have ha-ha. She supported me in my decision even though my career of choice was not necessarily a very stable one and suggested that I get another job to back it up, which I was going to do anyway.    Anyway, all of my stress about telling her was for naught. So some of my advice I guess is to not get tooo worked up about telling her.    If you love whatever you do, you have a much higer chance of being successful. One of the reasons MY mom wanted me to go into a "smart person" profession is because the people who are involved in them are more successful, financially and otherwise. But if you aren't going to love being a psychologist or whatnot then you probably won't be successful anyway. I'd try explaining that to your mom.    Good luck!  =]

qB2xq2H3aa	This is my second year using Turbo Tax. I used it last year and I thought that I got ripped off too a little bit when I found out the my refund was going to deposited into the Santa Barbara bank first, then mine afterwards. However, the process really didn't delay my check or anything.     In fact, the IRS deposited the check a couple of days before the date that Santa Barbara released it. I think the IRS deposited the check on a Tuesday or Wednesday and it was available that Friday morning. You can check that Santa Barbara website link to check the status of your check and it will also let you know if they even received it.    I just did my taxes again with Turbo Tax and the IRS accepted them last Saturday.

Anyway, my point is that this year we were able to use the free online TurboTax for our simplified return.    In the past, we've done the same thing and had the fees deducted from our refund.  To answer your question, though, SBB&T was always pretty prompt with the refunds.    We didn't have to pay any fees this year, neither to file nor to purchase the tax program!  Gee, and last year we paid around $50 to buy the program, only to have it file a 1040EZ for us!  Grrrr...    Good luck!    P.S.  We were also one of those who kept getting their refund date pushed back.  The "where's my refund" site now says Feb. 24, but the deposit is in our account today!!!

I work at Compass Bank and when you come in with your weekly check  and have used the overdraft you must pay a portion back, you will continue to receive notices that you have used portions of your overdraft until you have fully paid back the $1500.00

The balance of your account represents how much it would be worth today if you sold everything. Some days it is worth more on the open market, some days it is worth less.    The number of shares you own goes up when you put "new" money in (another contribution) and buy more shares.|`|AA10472839	Dave gave a good answer. You should have a better understanding of what you're doing. Your entire future depends on it.    Read: 401k's For Dummies and           Mutual Funds For Dummies|`|SN5dYkafaa	A 401(k) is a retirement plan named after the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes it. You make elective contributions to the plan, pre-tax, and there may be an employee match on a portion of it, as well. Your contribution is invested the investment choices you made, probably mutual funds.     A mutual fund's value is based on the underlying securities in the fund. For example, if you purchase a stock fund, there may be 100-200 different company stocks in the fund, that are valued at the end of each day.     When you make a contribution, you purchase a number of shares based on the price per share the day of your investment. If the stocks in your fund decline, the share price of your fund will decline, too, reducing the market value of your account. As you continue to add money each pay period, your share balance will increase.    Eventually, the value you'll ultimately receive down the road, be it a lump-sum distribution or monthly withdrawals, will be the number of shares you sell multiplied by the share price the day of the sale.

If the value of the investments in the fund go down, the value of your shares goes down.    If the value of the investment in the fund go up, the value of your shares goes up.    Except for cash value funds, which work more like a savings account.

TwqIpHJLaa	The answer is "it all depends."    Some people who get Social Security disability have to pay taxes on their benefits.  About one-third of the current beneficiaries pay taxes on their benefits.  The most the government can tax is 85% of one's benefits.  You and your husband will be affected only if you have substantial income in addition to your Social Security benefits.     If you file a joint return, you may have to pay taxes if you and your spouse have a combined income that is more than $32,000.     If you are married and file a separate return, you will probably pay taxes on your benefits.    If the kids benefits were paid to them (end of year form has their name and SSAN) do NOT report them on your tax return.  If they have no income apart from the social security, they need not file and will owe nothing to the IRS.    Why did the preparers give you differing things?  They were likely uncertain about the amount of your other income or one of them possibly thought you were talking about employer-funded disability payments as those are always 100% taxable.

Financial Management, is the easiest to define (the more difficult to do correctly).  It is simply that function of managing a company's funds.  That includes conducting the firm's borrowing and investing activities.  It generally includes determining cash in/out flows.  Determining exactly WHEN a payment is made, or when an investment s/b converted to cash.   Unfortunately, the whole field of accounting is job titles that have little to do with the actual job.  For example, have you ever noticed that like 99.9% of bank staff are "Vice Presidents"?  Of course I am just kidding, but it seems like that in the "WORLD"  It makes it difficult to figureout a person's responsibility!  The above is a "thumb-nail" description of Fin. Mgmt., and what some Financial Managers do.    Now, Financial Analysis - short def.:  A person who is provided financial information ($$$) from the acctg. dept.  He also recevies operating data from the operating departments (production dept., sales dept., etc.........  He then combines certain information, deletes other info, and prepares financial reports to not only top mgmt., but he provides custom reports for each of the operating depts, which enable all to monitor and evaluate their performance, and efforts.    Over time I've seen the merging of both areas, under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and that is becoming more of the norm.

mmAjpMX1aa	It really depends on what you're looking for.  The pay is pretty good at about $15/hr.    There are two kinds of census jobs: Administration and Collection.  They both pay the same rate at about $15/hr.  95% of the workers do Collection, which means walking from house to house gathering data on the residents.  You need to get 100% on the test to be placed in Administration, which is compiling the files, doing the adding of the numbers, answering phone inquiries, and sending the data to the government.      You have to work a 4 hour shift five days a week; specifically four weekday evenings and every Saturday afternoon (I believe Monday was the night we had off, due to government holidays).  Back in 2000, I had a choice of working the 5-9 or 6-10 weeknights.  I opted for the latter because I had another job but no car and couldn't leave work in time to make the early shift.  Also had to work 10-2 every Saturday.  It wasn't bad at all, working in the Admin office, but because I had another full-time job, I burned out after only 3 months of working there.  Plus, they hired extra people toward the end of my term to work admin on the early shift, which meant once I arrived at work, all the computer stations and filing areas were already occupied, and I therefore couldn't do anything.  I took that as a cue to quit.|`|3mAgM405aa	Please be aware of an update in the hourly salary of a census worker:  it's now $17 per hour.

You were claimed as a dependent on someone elses return in 2007 but cannot be claimed as dependent by someone else in 2008.|`|Daq9gituaa	If I read into your question right, you and your husband filed separately for tax year 2007 and received $300 each when the stimulus payments were mailed out. Your reported earning and amount of taxes paid did not warrant a higher amount to be paid to you; you got the minimum. If that is the case then YES, you do qualify for an additional amount under the recovery rebate credit for 2008 tax filings. Go to the IRS website and click on 1040 central and then select the instruction booklet for form 1040. Go to page "62" of the PDF file and use the worksheet to calculate any additional amounts you may be eligible for.    I would provide you the URL but for some reason Y1A will not process response with a web site address in them!

The amount of money you kept (your balance) and the market value of the property.   You pay income tax on the difference, that is your profit from the transaction, even though you actually received the money in prior years, you pay for the income now.    Your tax adviser should be able to show you how this works.

The information that Landlord and RE Guy is giving totally WRONG.       Congressional Bill HR 3648  Mortgage Forgiveness Act of 2007 and was signed into law as of mid December 2007.

This way no one can take it from you.

zI2KS0HOaa	Obtain a daily series of closing prices for A, B and some index you want to represent the market (S&P 500 for example).  Or weekly, or monthly, as you desired -- you may find it interesting to do all 3.    Translate the series of prices into price changes (each day, subtract yesterday's price from today's price).  Translate the price changes into percent price change by dividing by yesterday's price/100.  Translate the percent price change into a relative percent price change by subtracting the market's percent price change from the stock's percent price change.    Now you have two time series, one for A and one for B, that represent their daily percent price change relative to the market.  A simple Pearson correlation would be instructive, but other econometric techniques can be used to advantage.

Your lease or rental agreement should spell out how you will be charged for elect and water.  His actions should follow those rules.  3.

You were the valid tenant of the property until December 31, regardless of when you moved out.  Therefore, you owe the utilities until December 31.

I assume that the charges are minimal, since no one was living on the premises.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	If your lease went until December 31, and if your lease provided that you'd pay the electric and water bill during the term of your lease, then you owe the money.    It really shouldn't be that much, though. You're talking about 30% of one month. My water bill (in a house) for 3 months is $45. That's $15 a month; 1/3 of that would be $5. I'm guessing your bill would be substantially less. Electricity would be higher, but in a vacant apartment--maybe $15-$20?    But, if your lease ran though December 31 and the lease says you're responsible for utilities, then, yes, you owe it.|`|CvSmraPUaa	well if you took it out of your name no he can not charge you for what you did not use but on the other hand he should not charge you for the electricity if it's in his name at all because it should have been in your name.If it's not written in your copy of your contract than he can not charge you,the only reason for the electric to be in his name is either he is living there or he is doing electric included it does not make since for that to stay in his name when your paying it.and if he owes you a security deposit back then tell him to take it out of that,you know better yet go to the electric company your self and see what you actually used while you lived there.Good luck

The government steps in like a "corporate raider" and says turn over control your company but like a bankruptcy judge has the power to arbitrate with absolute authority between the various interests within the companies financial structure.    Because it is assumed that the nationalized bank is functionally bankrupt, it is assumed that the common stockholder will be completely cutoff from recovery (Remember Finance 101 -- the common equity holder is the last in line in any fight over assets)|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	Stock ownership is being part owner of a business.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	If the lien was put on the house while it was his property it is a legal lien.    The lien has to be paid off to refinance the house, this would include selling it.    The lien is not on you, it is on the ex's assets, the quit claim does not matter, it just looks like he is trying to hide the asset from her.    As soon as you bought something with him this became perfectly legal.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	First, consult with a lawyer.    From what you're describing (and I'm not a lawyer), yes, she can do what she did. Well, obviously she did it. The question is whether the lien is valid.    It may make a difference whether the lien was placed before or after he quit claimed his portion to you. The lien was for a debt he owed and his share of the house was an asset, and so a lien was appropriate. Now, if you were the sole owner of the house, I'm not confident a lien could be placed on it. That's assuming you recorded the quit claim deed. If you didn't, then he's still a part-owner.    If the lien is legitimate and you can't get out of it, try negotiating with your ex-boyfriend's ex-wife. Offer her a very small portion of the lien in order for her to lift it. Maybe offer 10%. All this should be done through a lawyer. Your lawyer should make it clear that you weren't the party that prompted the lien; you're an innocent victim, too. So, while you sympathize with her, you have neither the money nor the willingness to satisfy the full lien. However, you would be willing to pay a small amount in order for her to lift the lien. It's either that, or nothing. And, considering your financial situation, if the house is foreclosed on her lien will be totally valueless; it'll be wiped out by the foreclosure. So her choice is accept a small amount, or receive absolutely nothing.    But, even though you say you have no money to pay a lawyer, you really need a lawyer to represent you.    Hope that helps.|`|mqUaiNeUaa	You are between a rock and a hard place.

NcFWcO3Laa	First question  Is the amount owed on the property exceed the current market value.    If it does you can have the current owner of the property ask his lender if they would consider a "short-sale".   If the lender agrees then there is a good possiblity that you can.  The short-sale process can be long and involved.  I've seen some short-sales go as long as 10 months.  The problem with that in a declining RE market the house is often worth a lot less than it was several months prior and makes getting a loan impossible because the originial offer is above the current appraisial.    If the current owner still has equity in the property you would go forward in purchasing the property just like a normal sale.  But yes, the lender would have to be paid off at the close of escrow.  Most times a lender will not proceed with a foreclosure if the property is in escrow and be sold to a new buyer within 60 days. But the seller must inform the lender immediately.   Banks don't want any more foreclosures on their books and most will try and cooperate, within reason, with the sale.|`|5A7RmIH6aa	its a headache.dont bother.

Petro-Canada to Sponsor Project Homeless Connect for 2009      11:57 AM ET, February 5, 2009      CALGARY, ALBERTA, Feb 5, 2009 (Marketwire via COMTEX) -- Hundreds of homeless or near-homeless Calgarians will receive needed support through Project Homeless Connect (PHC) in 2009 due to the financial and in-kind support of Petro-Canada.

On-site access to materials and services include: medical treatment, counseling, housing, new identification documents, income support, employment and education opportunities. In addition, hair-cuts, meals, clothing and comfort kits containing personal items are provided.     "We are thrilled to have Petro-Canada's support for Project Homeless Connect," said Tim Richter, President and CEO of the Calgary Homeless Foundation. "With Petro-Canada's investment, as well as their direct participation in staging the four editions of PHC in 2009, the Homeless Foundation has a strong partner in helping provide much needed resources and supports to homeless and near-homeless Calgarians."

Project Homeless Connect (PHC) in Calgary     The Calgary Homeless Foundation organized and hosted Calgary's first PHC on April 26, 2008, serving 650 people. The next two PHC events saw a steady increase in participants, with 1,038 people served in the most recent event on November 22, 2009. PHC is an initiative from Calgary's 10 Year Plan to End Homelessness and is based on a model used in more than 170 communities in Canada, Australia and the United States.

If your employer has an employee retirement plan,  do join the plan and they will give you different options of investing and, chances are good, your employer may even contibute to the plan..Otherwise, attend a seminar on investing or, if you find a good broker you can trust consult him on how to start on your journey to investing....good luck|`|7oh1Qy9Gaa	I just got into the stock market and Im a teen too.

If you have something trickier though like self-employment, rentals, even itemized deductions, then you might want to consider a preparer.  Just make sure that you ask around and find somebody your friends/family recommend because there are a lot preparers out there who are not qualified.  My suggestion is to stay away from chains like H&R Block, Liberty Tax, Jackson Hewitt, etc. because many of them have brand new preparers fresh out of their tax schools who are confused about the tax laws.    A preparer can always help you with tax planning because once you build a relationship with them, they know your history and know what to look for and what questions to ask.

87bf158bb304ea5fffa0ae7b9402de03aa	***READ THIS BEFORE CHOOSING CAPITAL ONE***    Capital One sued over marketing practices      The Minnesota state attorney generals office has sued one of the nation's largest credit card issuers, claiming it is misleading consumers with promises of fixed interest rates, then hiking their rates as much as 400 percent.    Capital One and its subsidiaries are using bait-and-switch sales tactics, according to Attorney General Mike Hatch.  While the firm markets credit cards as having the nation's lowest fixed rates, rates can and often do change, the lawsuit alleges.  In fact, 40 percent of Minnesota residents who've signed up with a Capital One card thinking their rate is fixed have hit a tripwire, causing an overnight rate hike, Hatch said.    (They are) changing the English language, he said. Fixed rates don't mean fixed at all.      A Capital One spokesperson said the firm couldn't comment on the litigation, but offered a general statement.     Capital One has cooperated fully with the investigation and believes it has acted properly and in full compliance with the law, said Tatiana Stead. We regret the attorney general has chosen to proceed with the lawsuit, but we intend to continue to cooperate with (his) office.    Capital One's well-known no-hassle card television advertisements feature crowds of assaulting Vikings, representing high-interest rates chasing after consumers as they are about to make a credit card purchase. The lawsuit says the TV ads are simply false.     It also claims other Capital One marketing tools, such as direct mail solicitations, break Minnesota's laws prohibiting false advertising, consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices.  The lawsuit seeks an end to the marketing practices, and a return of any profits the firm has garnered as a result of misleading advertisements.      People surprised by 'penalty rates'  Consumers are often surprised by the tripwires that can trigger a penalty rate, Hatch said.  The lawsuit claims such tripwires are myriad, and are only mentioned in small print that appears for a few seconds on television advertisements, or at the bottom of direct mail solicitations.  Late payments to Capital One  or other creditors  can trigger a chain of events that lead to rate increases, he said.     Capital One aggressively markets its brand image as the credit card company with the nation's lowest fixed rates, Hatch said. But that image is false. If you do something as simple as pay a day late, your rate with Capital One can skyrocket overnight.    The firms' credit card business is booming.  According to its most recent SEC filings, Capital One's domestic credit card loans totaled $46.1 billion as of Sept. 30, 2004  earning the firm a quarterly income of $414.4 million, a 50 percent increase from the same period in 2003. Capital One spent $827 million on marketing from January through September of this year, and claims it has 46 million customers.     According to the lawsuit, Zimmerman, Minn. resident Nicole Bourgeois signed up for a Capital One card in July 2003 after seeing a TV ad. She directly asked if her 4.9 percent rate would stay the same for the life of the card, and was told it would. In March 2004, she was notified that her rate had jumped to 14 percent. Bourgeois contends she always paid her bills on time.  Another consumer, Robert Stein of Walker, Minn. said his rate went from 4.99 to 6.99 because he made one payment that was two days late.      Evasive telemarketers  The firms' marketing tactics are intentionally misleading, Hatch said. In one direct mail solicitation, Capital One describes its 4.99 percent interest rate as low 13 times and as fixed 17 times. Then, when consumers contact Capital One to apply for the card, Capital One telemarketers are prepared with scripts designed to evade a direct response to the question What does fixed mean?     In one script, phone operators are told to answer, Unlike most credit card companies, Capital One's fixed rate is not variable and will not go up and down as interest rates change.     Only if a consumer 'probes' another two times does Capital One concede that it cannot guarantee that its rates will stay the same forever, according to the attorney general's office.    In fact, consumers who qualify for a 4.99 percent interest rate can end up with a 20 percent penalty rate, according to the lawsuit. Other consumers with higher initial rates can see penalty rates of up to 26 percent. Such increases apply to the consumer's entire balance, even if earlier purchases were made when the consumer believed a lower rate applied.     Other rate-hike practices irk consumer advocates  Another Minnesota resident, Patsy Trusty, complained to Hatch's office that her credit limit was lowered by Capital One without prior notification, and as a result, she was hit by late fees and ultimately a higher interest rate.  The limit was lowered because her credit score had dropped, according to the lawsuit.    The controversial tactic is called universal default by credit card issuers.  Credit card firms  pull consumer credit reports as often as once a month to see if theres a late payment or other event that lowers a consumer's credit score. According to the industry, any late payment  even to an unrelated creditor, such as an auto loan issuer  makes a consumer a higher risk, and gives the credit card issuer the right to raise interest rates. Credit bureaus have specific products designed to catch consumers who are late with any bill.     The practice irks consumer advocates, who think late payment to one lender shouldn't impact interest rates charged by another  and believe the practice is simply designed to give credit card firms an excuse to raise ra|`|tdQTZPI7aa	9% on credit card|`|GMQDzcSZaa	Depends on your credit. I've seen rates as low as fixed 2% and as high as 24.9% (soon going up to 29.9% through change in terms) Big Evil your post was a long response but also lame. 3 things there 1. They don't dodge answering what a fixed rate is; they just don't know cause they're dumb. Number two your interest rate stays the same granted you pay ON TIME and you don't get a change in terms. FIXED VS Variable. Variable changes from month to month based on prime (read up) and fixed is the same every month granted you make your payments on time. God i hate people who miss payments and then get pissy when a company assesses you as having a higher risk.  Retards. There's nothing wrong with capital one it's the stupid customers who can't manage their finances, show me ONE case where someone genuinely did NOTHING wrong and I will show you a decent fixed rate. oops had to come back Capital one doesnt participate in universale default.  So whatever

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	Well as a former chef and having held a sous chef position for 15 years, it is a job that involved running the kitchen for the executive chef, or in a smaller place maybe doing the alternate shift and running the day or night service for the head chef.    It is job you have to work yourself up to, with almost 10 years of station chef positions, I was the saucier and garde manger in several, and those are the 2 most prized stations, I did my training in Toronto On hotels and went to a local community college for my school portion of the apprentice program.    As a sous chef you have to organize and supervise the kitchen and service, making sure the station chef have the work done, expediting the orders during the rush period and have the food requisitions done for the chef or stores manager. It is a salary position and does in some case require a bit more involvement of time than the others in the kitchen.

Since you can simplify the 15/100 fraction to be .15/1 (moving the decimal point two places to the left for both numbers) the equation then becomes .15/1 = x/23.99. From there, the equation is simple to solve via cross multiplication:    1x = .15*23.99  x = .15*23.99  x = 3.5985.    Since we are dealing with dollars and cents, you round up to the whole cent (or 1/100 of a dollar), which is 3.60.    From there, simply subtract:    23.99 - 3.60 = 20.39 Sale price.

Unfortunately as in many situations,  some times the honest people get stuck suffering/punished for the not so honest people. Know that just because my date was pushed for that reason it does not mean that that is why your date was pushed.

VLlyZKYYaa	You certainly can. One of the biggest things to find out is how long it has been on the market. The longer it's been on the market, the more desperate they will be to sell and the better the deal for you. Can you find out records for the amount the property was purchased for and when? Since it is corporate owned, I assume this is in pre-foreclosure, right? Because if it was foreclosed, then the bank would own it. If it is in pre-foreclosure, then these guys are desperate to sell to avoid the bank taking it and having a foreclosure on their credit. Simply ask some questions, like when the bought the property, how much is left on the mortgage. They may or may not be honest with you. This will give you a good idea of what to offer them. These are desperate times for people, and if they can get out of this deal breaking even, they just might take it.|`|6t76bgS3aa	you can indeed, and the owners can sometimes get desperate because they're not in the business of owning houses|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Is it bank owned or preforeclosed?

Good luck.|`|AA12255473	you can offer any price.  Nothing is set in stone untill both sides sign that contract and a notary verifies it.    I'd offer a price below what they ask, and with the current conditions, my offer would take into consideration how much lower that price could possibly go.  I purchassed a house recently and had i waited longer, I probably could have gotten it quite a bit cheaper.  Don't feel sorry for anybody and I personally wouldn't give a rip if they get offended. I give them whatever offer I feel it is worth and if they don't like it then nobody is forcing them to sell it to me.    But then if they wait longer, they might not be able to sell it even for what you offer them. So it's up to you to research things and try to figure out how bad you think the market will be in the near future.  things could change too, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen in a hurry.

nVymQlCNaa	this is how I did it.   1. Went to the bank got a visa debit card.   2. Waited till the card arrived at my home.  3. Activated it that day, took about two weeks to arrive.  4. I logged onto pay-pal to setup account.  5. Under add credit card, typed in card numbers and code on back.  6. Clicked on add card to complete.  7. to be pay-pal verified add your checking account number.  this tells buyers your address is verified.  8. buy something cheap to test the water.  So the answer to your question is no. because pay-pal offers a pay-pal debit card. I've been on their since 2007. Called but still waiting.  9. the real answer to your question is yes.  10. Why you ask? If you don't have a bank card, good luck spending your profit. with a bank card you can transfer money to bank account.  hope this helps sammrhandy|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	how would you spend the money  once someone paid you?    it helps to have an bank account with paypal|`|yJ3GpnXAaa	Presumably you've opened your PayPal account, but not added any financial information, as yet.    You can accept money for items you sell and that will go into your PayPal account.    But unless you add a bank account, you won't be able to get your hands on any of the money you make - all you'll be able to do is spend it online direct from your PayPal account.    If you're planning on selling on eBay to make your money, you are aware that you'll be charged listing fees by eBay and these fees are generally paid either by direct debit (from your bank account) or 'continuous authority payment' (from your credit card) or from your PayPal balance.    If you have no bank account, card or money in your PayPal account (which you won't have, at least to start with), you won't be able to pay the fees.

They also will do a background check.  You will also need experience in the field you are applying for.  With unemployment at 7.5%, you are competing with millions of other people who are out of work.

AA11955868	If the rent is due on the 5th it's due on the 5th. If you paid it today there's little she can do about it. Sometimes banks are slow to work transfers, if this was such a concern for her maybe she should have asked you to pay by check so she could go immediately deposit it into her bank. It isn't your fault that she doesn't have a back up plan.|`|VLlyZKYYaa	You have a copy of your lease, right? Look at the date it says rent is due. If it says the 5th, then that is your last day. the 6th is late and the 5th is fine. Any landlord that is going month to month like that is having some serious financial/management issues and you are not the reason for it. She should have not put herself in that situation to rely on your money so quickly. Also, look at your lease and make sure it isn't month to month. If it is, she could do something crazy and give you the boot at the end of the month, but it sounds like she is desperate for money so i'm sure she wouldn't want to go a month or longer without a tenant. Does the lease say anything about late fees being charged?|`|RZzMse3Haa	NO! She is completely wrong and a little nuts!    If your rent is due on the 5th, then she has no right to call and make any demands until it is late on the 6th.  It is illegal for landlords to harass tenants for the rent before it is late.      Next time she does this, inform her that she is breaking the law and that she cannot legally do anything about your rent until it is officially late.  She needs to adjust that other payment coming from her account. That has nothing to do with you.|`|23SkYEw5aa	you are wrong.  The rent is due the 1st.  You have UNTIL the 5th to make sure that the money is available to her.  Just because you "sent" the money (via the bank) on the 5th is not good enough.  She will not receive it until the 6th.  This is YOUR FAULT, not the banks or the landlords.    If she wants to charge you a late fee, then she is within her right.    Next time pay on time - which is the first.|`|2H4QOwFzaa	Read your rental agreement--if should state that the rent is due on xx day of the month, and if it is not received by xx day of the month a late charge will be added on to the rent for that month.  If your rent is due on the 5th of the month, she can not add any type of late charge until the 8th.    I don't know where she has been living, but the banks always put through the debits first and then they apply any credits  your account.  It sounds like she is in a financial bind and that is not your problem.    How long have you lived there, and is this the first time that she has called you screaming?    She can give you a notice to move within sixty days without stating a reason.  I would not want to live at a place where the owner is going to be getting upset each month.  Make sure that you are keeping all of your receipts, and start a log with all of her telephone conversations.    Take pictures of all of the rooms, and the outside of your unit.  She is the type when you get ready to move she will blame you for damages that were already there when you moved into the unit.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	Regardless, if the due date is the 1st with a 5 day grace period or the rent is due on the 5th. The day ends at 11:59:59pm. I've had tenants knock on my door at 11pm to pay the rent.    I think your landlord is blowing alot of hot air. She cannot change the terms of the rental agreement that is currently in effect.    However, I should point out that making payments online like this does have a long time to process. So there can be some question if you were late paying or not.|`|b5ed16c940be1868f0aa615afa8d8e15aa	If rent's due _on_ the fifth, she shouldn't be calling you to pizz and moan about the fact you haven't paid, especially at 8:30. If rent's due _by_ the fifth, that's another matter. Ultimately, her mortgage payment and her bank account are her problems (until she goes into foreclosure, then it sucks to be you).     She can't come and shake a few hundred out of your pocket, but if you failed to pay, she'd have had recourse under the law. Depending on your state laws and the type of tenancy you have, they'd either be late fees, a notice to pay or quit, a notice to quit, or filing for an order of eviction. She could also sue you for the rent you owed. BUT she wouldn't have been able to start any of those balls rolling until tomorrow, if your rent's actually due _on_ the fifth.|`|czP6VBi9aa	Firstly, she should be patient. Times are tough for everyone, probably her too. Sometimes the banks are on the next day. No, she can't make you pay, she can add late charges depending on your lease. She could give you a 5 day notice of rent being paid late and also has a choice of excepting it afterward but it really depends on your lease.   She should appreciate that she has a paying tenant late or not.   I know I do.
VELnLnIKaa	takes 10 days|`|M2WniUdzaa	Did you get the rebate recovery credit?  If you did, it will delay your refund by 1 week, while the IRS verifies that you are actually entitled to the credit.  The IRS normally makes its deposits on Fridays.  If you took the rebate recovery credit, you should have it by the 13th.  They say the 17th to allow time for your bank to post the funds to your account.

4MypYVHYaa	It is possible, but then you will be jumping through many loops to achieve this type loan. You will also be charged a higher interest rate than the ones that a person with the same credit score would get if they proved their income.    Also you might have to come up with more than just a little down. Try about 20% at the bare minimum.    Also you might be required to produce bank statements that prove that you can cover anywhere from 3-6 months of the mortgage payments.    I hope has been of some use to you, good luck.

The logical thing to do here though, is to call Wal-Mart and speak with the manager. Better to seem a little lost now, then a fool later.    I would also make sure to have your schedule worked out, so that when you start your new job its after a proper 2 weeks notice.

You pay down your debt, spoil yourself a little AND do your part for our economy and life is good for all involved :)|`|xoqQbHi1aa	Take $1,000 or so and put hat into savings as an emergency fund.  Use the rest to pay down your debt.  If you still have debt left, that you won't be able to pay off completely within three months,  then follow this plan starting at A.  If you can pay it off completely within three months, then start at 1.      A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. The holidays are coming and there will be plenty of temporary jobs available. It is better to have a no fun year or two than a no fun decade.       Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.    2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.    3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt  1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt  2. That will pay debt  2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card  3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:    To start :  Debt  1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment  Debt  2 (middle interest): minimum payment  Debt  3(lowest interest): minimum payment    Debt  1: paid off  Debt  2: minimum payment from Debt  1+ Minimum payment from Debt  2 +extra payment  Debt  3: minimum payment    Debt  1: paid off  Debt  2: paid off  Debt  3:Mimimum payment from card  1+ minimum payment from Debt  2+ minimum payment from Debt  3+ extra payment.    That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.    4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.    5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.    5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.    5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.    You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan.
H17L1WW4aa	That makes no sense at all.  Im doing loans at 5.5% on VA and FHA closed both today at that rate.  And I paid every dime of their costs.  They came in with a 225K on one loan and a 300K on the other loan.  thats what they started.  We closed and the 225K loan was a new loan at 225K and got 50 dollars back.  The 300K loans closed at 300K and they got back 75 dollars.  Closing another one tomorrow FHA, same thing but had to go 5.75 because its only a 110K loan but it will leave as a 110K loan.  No cost to the borrower.  The lender pays it all from the YSP.  (yield spread premium)  Sure I will only make 1000 on the loan but im not greedy.  I would rather do 20 loans a month making 1000 each then 1 loan making 20K.    Their was still plenty of money for me to pay all the title fees and lenders fees and still make money.  They didnt pay a dime (got 50 bucks back) and their principal didnt move 1 penny.    If you want a 5% that is doable.  Maybe a 1% origination (no processing), 1000 in title and 785 in lenders.  Thats what you should be looking at.  The LO still makes 2400 bucks thats good enough.      So yes she was screwing you, or as one said didnt know what she was doing.      *** UPDATE  ***    No its not a good deal.  The person below me mentioned that she had to take you VA because you didnt have enough equity for a FHA loan.  Well the maximum loan on VA is 100%  So that makes no sense.    With FHA you can go 97.25% of the value of the home.  Sure you might have to bring in 2-3K to close to loan at the 97.25%.  But why dont you take a 6% rate.  The lender might have 3 points to help pay the costs.  So they pay all lenders fees, appraisal, title.     So now you have an FHA loan at 6% its a high rate.  But you had YSP to help you.  Now you have a 6% rate but it didnt cost you a penny.  You came in with 2000 but it lowered your principal balance to compensate that you can only have a 97.25% LTV.  Now you can use it for VA as well but that makes no sense at this time.  4 months from now you can streamline your FHA mortgage (no credit qualifications, no income qualifications, and just drop the rate.)    Still not costing you a penny to your principal.    Your last loan will be the VA since there is no mortgage insurance.  But if you do it first its .0.5% upfront mortgage insurance no monthly.  If you streamline it its 3.5%.    Thus its your last loan in a process.    They loan she structured I dont even think is possible even with VA.  I guess I dont understand why she would take you VA unless you already are.  I have to assume that, otherwise it makes no sense.    Dont look at this as a one closing deal.  Might take you 2 or 3 to get where you want.  But never raise your principal.|`|UeLigNB0aa	There was no way for her to do an FHA loan because you do not have enough equity so she switched you to a VA loan because VA will allow 100% ffinancing. If you do not want the funding fee($4,704 paid to VA) rolled into the loan just tell her that you want to pay it at closing. So lets look at the numbers.  Appraised value is $224,000 with a balance of $218,000.00, your payoff will be higher due to interest. She is showing $5,560 in closing costs which sounds right given the 5% rate.  Add the funding fee of $4,704(paid to VA) plus the actual closing costs of $5,560 to your payoff and you have your new loan.   In my opinion you are getting a very good deal.    Edit to response: It is very possible that she did structure the loan with you bringing money to close and the automated system would not approve the loan. It's also possible that she simply forgot that you wanted to pay down the loan.  There are also some brokers who would absolutely recommend not investing liquid assets in a mortgage for several reasons the main ones being   1) Is the money working for you(earning) in a mortgage?  2) Can you access that money in the event of an emergency?|`|eytlIKITaa	It doesn't sound like she really knows what she's doing.  And she's just looking for the commission.  I'd talk to another LO and see what they have to say.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	Good for you, you pulled the plug before it cost you more.    Now, here is what I used to tell my clients:    Be sure your current mortgage has no prepayment penalty. If there is no penalty, just make additional payments- one or two extra mortgage payments that you tell the lender is to be applied to principal ( that is very important)  will save you a huge amount of money over the long haul, and can reduce your forty year mortgage by a decade or more ( depending on how long you make the extra payments). Since you had extra cash that you could have used to pay closing costs, use that to pay down your mortgage faster.|`|zUXijLLuaa	Hard to say if it was a rip off, depending on what you told her you wanted. If you wanted to lower your payment and get a fixed rate loan, (like most people want right now) then yes, she helped you. If you wanted to modify your loan to a lower rate without paying anything, then I guess she screwed you. Did you think you were going to re-do your loan for free? She made it so you dont even have to pay out of pocket, which is good for most people right now. Honestly, it was crazy that you were originally in a 40 year loan... I would have taken the loan she offered if you plan on owning the house for about 8+ years... it would pay off at that point.     Hope that helped.|`|vigFmfLmaa	I agree with you.  You definitely don't want to be upside down in a mortgage right now.  If you don't trust your broker, move on.  Refinancing can be a very complicated process, on that you want to be comfortable with and understand.  If she's not helping you do that then I would find someone else.      And as a sidenote that extra $11k she added to your loan beefed up her 1% fee by $110 and increased her loan out quota for the month.   $11000 for closing costs is absurd.  Sounds like a very shady deal and I think you were smart for not signing on the dotted line.
zsXT62Z9aa	An auto insurance policy covers an accident when the insured, or someone who was given permission to drive the car, has an accident.  It sounds as if the insured is now claiming that he (or she) wasn't driving the car at the time of the accident, and that whomever WAS driving, did not have permission to use the car.  In other words, that it might have been stolen.  Or else the person driving the car was excluded from coverage on the owner's auto insurance policy.  That is legal.  But how did that person get the keys?    If the vehicle was stolen, then the owner of the vehicle has no obligation to pay for the damage to your car.  If the person driving the car was excluded from coverage on the owner's policy, that would allow the insurance company to disclaim coverage and NOT pay your claim.  However, the owner of the car is still liable for your damages, and would have to pay for the damages out of their own pocket.    Did the police come to the scene?  If not, then lesson to be learned here is ALWAYS call the police whenever there is a car accident.  At this point, the accident is your word against the other driver's word.      It does matter who was driving the car.  Trust me on that.  You still may have a legal case against the owner of the car, but without knowing more details, I can only advise you to this extent.    You can bring an action against the owner of the car, and then it will be up to him (or her) to defend themselves.  Perhaps small claims court might be your best bet?  That way, you won't need a lawyer.  You bring the case yourself.  There's a small filing fee, but if you win, you can perhaps have the other party re-pay you for the filing fee, as well as for your damages.    If you can get the witness to write down a statement and sign it, as well as get it notarized, then you can use this to help you pursue your case in Small Claims Court.  Photos of the damage to your car and to the other person's car would also be helpful.  If there is no police report, then you can also draw a diagram of the accident scene to help you, too.  The more proof you have, the better off you should be.    Good luck!!|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	OK, you posted this to USA, but clearly, this is a UK question.     The other person's insurance has NO duty of good faith towards YOU.  You will have to sue the other person, who was driving.     Having said that, they DO need to return that original logbook to you.      You are NOT going to get that $3K, unless you sue them and win.  Your view of things, doesn't bind the contract they have in place with their insured.

2N6oTOLQaa	For starters you can go kick your divorce attorney in the nuts. He should have insisted that the house be refinanced or sold before your divorce was finalized. The bottom line is your name is on the mortgage, so you are responsible for the mortgage. No divorce agreement in the world has the authority to change that. The divorce court may throw some sticks at your ex for failure to pay as agreed, but nothing can fix your credit, your name is on the loan.|`|zUXijLLuaa	Sell it to me and Ill turn around and sell it back to you at a reduced price...

You live and now you learn. The only thing for him to do is get current and stay that way for 12 months so he can possibly refinance it with signing a quit claim for your share. If it goes to the point of foreclosure then you as well as the ex will pay the balance after the sale as they will come after both of you for the $$$

Anything would just be speculation.|`|qBCGH52haa	Obviously, the actual details still have to be worked out...assuming the Senate passes the stimulus bill, they still have to go meet with the House and negotiate over the differences in the two Bills, of which this is one.

qWaYbxcxaa	We'll, people (mostly mutual fund mangers, and public investment advisers, and real estate agents, some people on Y!A and a number of other professions) have been calling for a bottom in every stock or the market since fall 2007.    I have noted this and pointed out that calling a bottom is very difficult. Odds are the one will be wrong. They all have been wrong. I have worked with a top Wall Street firm, managed money professionally, actively traded stocks and options, and have studied the markets for 20 years and I don't know where THE bottom is. And I would not take a guess, because guessing is usually wrong. If I could guess that well, I'd be picking 6 numbers on the lotto each week.     My experience has shown me that I seem to be better at calling market tops than market bottoms.     I sold out of GE on or about early 2007 somewhere at around $40ish. I have not had any interest in GE since.    I traded BAC last summer and got out around $53.00.  I thought the div looked attractive (then about 6% or so), and thought the USG would not let them fail. About a week later I change my entire view on this and exited the stock with a small hit.    If someone asked me do you think BAC would be performing worse than Citigroup (C), I would have said, they still have risks like all banks, but I would have said that they were not as likely to fail. Now, look at me aggressively buying $5.00 puts on BAC over the last week. Closed them out today, and actually went long for a while today (02-05-2009) (for what it's worth, over all decent net gains).    So where is the bottom for GE? Who knows?  But I guess if you call a bottom every day, then one day you will be right. The key is, will you have anyone still listening you for being wrong for over 400 days in a row?|`|C233ATPvaa	Sometime between now and apocolypse.|`|bHy3GMuKaa	In the area of $6.50 but it could take a while...and that figure could increase/decrease with one little "breaking news" story.|`|e0a81333aa57f8661514f1fcf591fc64aa	if there is a baiout in banks soon, then GE is probably gonna rise with the rest of the market.|`|L9Cx70gtaa	I was going for $8 two or three months ago, but I'm open to revising that lower.

AA10464818	1 - Adwords will NOT help you rank in the organic (or as you call it, standard) searches. Google is proud of the fact that they do not mix organic and paid search results. The paid search results (your Adwords ad) is seen only on the side under the column SPONSORED LINKS to differentiate it from the organic search results    2 - It depends on several factors:    - what are your objectives?  - what can you afford?  - how competitive are your keywords?  - what's the mix of your keywords (e.g. "diamond ring" or is it "pink colored diamond engagement ring 1 carats" -- which can have a huge price difference)  - how well crafted your landing page will be  - what type of ROI are you thinking of getting    3 - Some have daily budgets of $1,000 or more while some have $20 or less.

If it were a personal check from someone, then they might hold it until they know that that person does in fact have the money.  I have had this happen to me at my credit union.

C0tYtelFaa	The answer is True.  market price/ earnings per share  The market price is now, but P/E can be calculated in one of three ways, depending on the lifecycle of the company..     1) Can be calculated off past performance usually last 12 months (most relaible) -- earnings per share are not estimated.    2) Can be calculated off future performance (done if new company or entering new business line and thus have no past data to support)    3) Can be calculated off the last 6 months and future by 6 months..     In most cases though, the answer is true. If you have a high P to E ratio, people are willing to pay more for a company with positive earnings (which means the company has a good track record for being reliable and profitable)...|`|C233ATPvaa	True, past earnings are paramount.|`|tpEI2cuBaa	True, but with lots of caveats.  The "most true" situation would be a stable company in a stable industry which has little competition.  In that instance, historical performance would be one of several key drivers of total enterprise value and hence your P/E ratio.    In other situations, examples include companies with negative earnings, high growth industries, dynamic companies with changing business models, companies with high degrees of innovation, etc... would likely trade more on expectations of future performance than only on past performance.
C0tYtelFaa	I would have to side with false here...    I believe the answer that would make this true is Operating Profit Margin...    Operating profit could mean that revenues were great, but cost were higher than normal, or revenues were down, and costs were greatly reduced..
meK0ziCJaa	I would keep track of how many calls you get, what time the calls are made, and the agency that is placing the calls. It could be that different agencies are trying to reach you. If it is one agency, write a letter to the attorney general's office with your concerns. Also, if you do not want calls at all, mail a letter using certified mail requesting that all communication be done in writing.     To answer your question about the number of calls that would be considered harassing, there is not specific, set number. It's not quantity, but rather quality. Some states have a set number of calls the agency can place a month. Other states are silent on the issue. I wouldn't plan on suing a company or even having your debts erased as a result of this. They will most likely just take your phone number out of the system.     If the calls continue, refer to your log and contact the attorney general's office again. They keep a record of complaints against an agency.
Fmhsy8CKaa	Fast food joints, baggers at a grocery store, since you are so young it will be hard to find one. There are so many restrictions on the hours you can work and it may not be worth it to hire you.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	very few jobs you are allowed to do before age 16 - child labor laws|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|cb77e04516346d0ad65065d343a80b28aa	Babysit, mow the lawn, snow removal....

meK0ziCJaa	I respectfully disagree with the second poster. It doesn't matter when the latest activity is on the account, even if it's paid in full. What matters is the delinquency date, that never changes...or shouldn't at any rate.     I would not take the advice to not pay your bills, that's ridiculous. Why would you wait until you need to apply for a loan to pay bad debt accounts? However, it does matter to potential lenders that you have no open negative accounts on your file. I think it's better to pay upfront and then be done with it.     If I were in the situation, I would dispute the account through the credit reporting agencies, stating your claim that you did not receive a first notice, containing the FDCPA required, Validation notice. See what happens. Also, call the creditor and explain that you didn't receive the first notice and that this is now negatively affecting your credit. They may recall the account from the agency.|`|AA11173563	no it will increase the score over time in fact|`|b007371eab69364e811cf06269921755aa	FICO scoring does not differentiate between paid and unpaid collection accounts. All it knows is that there is a collection account there, and as such your score will drop.     But paying a collection account CAN lower your score. The reason for this is that FICO scoring gives the greatest weight to recent (within 24 months) accounts. When you pay the account, the collector will be forced to update the account to show as paid, bringing the activity more recent. That recent collection account will hurt your score much worse than just leaving it alone.     I advise people to NEVER pay collection accounts unless they are facing one of the following...    - The collector agrees to remove the account through a "pay for delete" or non-disclosure agreement.     - The debtor is facing a lawsuit as a result of the debt.     - The debtor must satisfy the account to secure a home/auto loan, a security clearance or employment.     Unless one of those scenarios has come up, there is absolutely zero benefit to paying off a collection account.      Since you have already paid it, you might consider visiting CreditBoards.com. This is a free credit discussion forum and you can run a search for threads about removing paid collections and get lots of information.
MmTe8W8uaa	Yes, the $500 that you may to the state can be deducted on the Schedule A for the year that you paid the state (in other words, the Schedule A filed the year after you paid the state).    Note that this applies only to state and local tax.  You wrote that you paid it "via a check to the IRS".  Payments to the IRS are for federal tax, not for state and local tax.  No deduction is allowed for payments to the IRS of federal tax.|`|UV2V8oBYaa	You claim the state tax as a deduction the year you pay it. You can not claim the amount you are paying this year. only the tax you paid last year.    You can not claim that $500. You will get to claim that next year.    you will claim as income the $300 this year.

5zQbG8TDaa	Collect unemployment. Keep looking for work everyday. Take anything until you can better yourself.
C3fODS2Eaa	You can use a debit card. For internet merchants, they'll accept any visa or mastercard "debit" card or check card. The downside is that if that specific card number is ever compromised or stolen and used, the recovery of stolen funds tied to a bank account is much more difficult than if that same card number was from a credit card.    When a credit card number gets stolen and used, you'll simply contact your credit card company and let them know at which point the charges are "magically" erased from your bill. It isn't nearly as easy to recoup funds from a debit card / bank account.    The main reason for this is that it is whatever future merchant accepts that stolen credit card, it is their responsibility to verify the validity of that transaction. There's no way they have to absolutely guarantee the transaction, but they can do things like only ship to the same address as the billing address or other things like get certified by Visa and MC to collect the CVV code or CVC2 code from the back of the card.     There are some things that they can do, but it falls on them. There is no way to protect 100%, but getting back to your very first question, the answer is YES, you can use a debit card online as long as it is a visa or mastercard branded card.    Good luck!|`|NZuJR79oaa	yes. it will process through just the same as long as it is a visa, MasterCard, discover, etc. debit card. most bank cards now are.

However, when it comes to disputing a charge you have more rights if you had actually used your credit card. If you don't have a credit card you may consider opening one because as the state of affairs stands you need to build a credit history if you plan on buying a home, car, etc. Just don't get in over your head with credit cards.|`|q1MC7dsDaa	Yes.  However, it must have a Visa or Mastercard logo.    Cheers!
aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	You have to go to the state and ask. All states are different. some allow you to work without a licence as long as it is for someone who has one but teaching may be different. Ask at the community college, they are a lot more lenient than you might find anyplace and that also depends on the state and county. Others require a licence or a certificate and that is usually through a community college sometimes or a technical school. Call your local County Building Inspector or go to the phone book and just start calling until you get the person that knows the answer. We are so rural here that all it takes is experience and knowing someone in the position to hire you...LOL No kidding. Small town politics...gotta hate it!  Good luck. Miss Mary

zUXijLLuaa	Ask if there is anything that you can improve upon...     You can start the conversation with your boss like -    I have been here for a while now, and I wanted to know how I am doing. I want to make sure I am living up to the expectations I layed out during the interview and the requirements of the position. If I am not, I want to know how I can improve on that...    Id say dont even talk about the conversation you overheard because its his or her job to evaluate your performance to his superiors.     Also, you may want to improve your work habits... by my clock, its like 2pm on a work day... Maybe a little less Yahoo Answers and a little more "work"???

If you have a joint bank account with both signatures on file so the bank knows it's you who signed your name, they MIGHT cash it, or at least let you deposit it into your joint account.
s30Duwdraa	Definitely ask for the manager.  Employees don't care, plus they may feel threatened that you may take over their job one day.  Make sure you just ask for the manager and not tell them why, unless they ask.    Introduce yourself, get his/her name and number.  and then you should also follow-up with the manager in a week or two if you haven't heard from them.  Ask them if they had a chance to look at your application and when is the best time to come in for an interview.  If you're up front like that, most managers appreciate it and will give you a time!    PS: If you really want to make a good impression, drop a cover letter off highlighting your qualities along with your application.  Good luck!

K7x1RHVFaa	They are pretax deductions you itemize on you schedule A  forms under medical expenses as relates to you AGI ceiling.    edit.    I noticed someone thinks I am wrong and so I will defend this answer.    As far as filing you deductions, there are deductions for AGI and deductions from AGI. Medical Insurance premiums are normally computed as deduction for AGI and you itemize them on your schedule A. There are only a few exception and none of them urn this deduction into something that comes from Tax or Taxable Income. You will notice that there is no distinction as to taxed versus pretaxed premiums as to whether they are deductible.    http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar0...    This next form is doubtfully pertinent to you but I include it in the rare chance that you received such disbursements. they are handled differently.    http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099h/a...    If you're self-employed or a shareholder in an S corporation, or partner in a partnership, the medical insurance premiums should be claimed as an adjustment to gross income on Line 29 of Form 1040. This treatment is more beneficial than claiming the medical insurance premiums as an itemized medical expense deduction. Again this is still treated as a deduction for AGI. You have not even reached taxable income yet.    Basically the only effect of pretaxed versus taxed insurance premiums is a reductionin the ammount that goes to social security taxes paid.     http://www.coredocuments.com/section_125...    Your wages are taxed the same and deductions are treated the same.    Pre-taxed for return computation purposes does not mean the same thing as pre-taxed for insurance purposes. I assumed you were asking a return question because you used the word deduction.      I try and keep my answers succinct but if it helps others to read more then so be it.    Good Luck.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	They can be either.  Look at your pay stub or statement.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	They are usually pre-tax, but could be either.  I once had a job where my dental was pretax for federal taxes but taxable for New Jersey taxes.    Cupid's vision is wrong.  You are not allowed to include pretax contributions on Schedule A.  Insurance premiums are allowed on Schedule A only if either (a) you paid it directly (not through payroll deduction) or (b) it was an after-tax contribution, which is included in Box 1 of your W-2.|`|UV2V8oBYaa	any pre-tax amounts are not deductible.

Add insurance @ about $40-$60 a month and taxes (depending the tax rate for you area) $100-$150 a month.  Or $570-$640 a month total payment.  Also consider asking the seller to pay some of your closing cost.  A seller is allowed to pay up to 3% of the sales price of the buyers costs on most conforming conventional loans and FHA.    You income is about $31,000 a year.   Your house payment+car payment ratio is about 40%-42%.   Which might be a little high to qualify, but I'd say its border-line.  If you purchased a less expensive home or put more money down I think you would qualify without a problem.......What is your FICO?  How long have you been on your job? In your profession?   These are all factors.    Suggest contacting a direct lender, like Countrywide Mortgage in your area and get pre-qualified.  They can tell you exactly how much you can spend on a home.  They do this service without charge.  Then find a realtor in your area and go buy a house.    Also remember the the income tax advantages of owning a home can save you around $150 a month in income taxes for a house in this price range.
39c35c6fdaa73a52165645cdd71d5617aa	Yes, as long as you (and the property you buy) meet FHA requirements, it doesn't matter that it's a foreclosure.    If the property isn't in the best condition, you could take out a HUD 203(k) loan. Info about that is here: http://creativefinancing101.com/hud-203k...    Basically, this is an FHA loan that allows you to take out additional money for renovations as a part of your mortgage. An inspector will determine how much the property will be worth after the repairs are made and you'll get a loan for that amount. You'll be given an escrow account that the contractors can be paid from.     If the foreclosure home is in ok condition, then a traditional FHA 203(b) loan should work. Most major lenders can help you with that.|`|AA11173563	yes you can get a FHA note if the property qualifies|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	As long as the house passes the FHA inspection they do not care who owns it.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Sure you can. The only potential snag is that banks often sell foreclosures "as-is" meaning they aren't willing to put a single dime into repairs to sell the house. Normally that's okay because buyer's are willing to fix the minor things. But with an FHA loan, there are pretty strict rules about the house being in good condition. You might find yourself between a rock and a hard place. The bank won't fix something but FHA won't give you a loan until its fixed. With a conventional mortgage there could be more flexibility to deal with minor repairs.|`|yHl7RIuOaa	Yes. Do not get hung up with "foreclosure".  You are simply buying a home and the seller is a bank.|`|UeLigNB0aa	yes if the property qualifies and the lender accepts FHA financing

Now that would likely have a result of increasing the tax on the property, and could drive up costs to increase the rent again.    If the system is set up to make sure that the purchase used to justify rental was not from some other rental provider, we might think we have a way to avoid this. But  people have been known to use third parties to avoid being seen in that  circumvention.    If the law were to be maintained fairly, it would drive rental out of the housing market. People would have to buy or live on the street.|`|23SkYEw5aa	your question doesn't make sense.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	There are no such laws, limiting rent amounts to some percentage of a property's value.

SEwqwjPkaa	I'm amazed by how many people answer questions when they have absolutely no clue what they're talking about.    Here's the detail as I've taken the credit, have read about the new one, and already got my $...    The original $7500 tax credit contained in the previous stimulus bill was actually a tax free 17 year loan.  The taxpayer who took said credit would be required to repay the loan starting the 2nd tax year after claiming it.  The payback plan would be $500 each year for 15 years.  As of right now this is how it will work.    However, the new bill which passed the Senate yesterday and is now in the hands of the House, will allow for a $15000 credit with NO PAYBACK CLAUSE.  Additionally, the House is revising the bill to remove the "payback clause" on the original $7500.  So, if it passes, those of us who took the $7500 credit will no longer be required to pay it back.    So, to answer your question, YES, you qualify for the credit because you closed within the stipulated time frame.  And NO, there's no need to wait for the new bill, at least not unless you wouldn't take the $7500 credit based on the fact you have to pay it back.  If the bill doesn't pass, then most likely the $7500 would have to be paid as per the original stipulations of the original provision.  If you take the $7500 credit today, and the new bill passes, and you're still eligible for the additional $7500, you'll simply get it separate and after your original refund comes in.  So far, they're talking as though one could file an amended 2k8 return which would be much better than waiting for 2k9 to end.    I didn't mean to step on everyone else but when I needed this info I got the same crappy short answers...so I thought I'd go ahead and provide you with all the info I managed to come up with on my own.    Peace and good luck!  The Reverend|`|znr8SBiWaa	Was this your first house?  Meaning did you and/or your spouse not own a home in the last three years?  Does your income meet the requirements?    If so, you'll get the First Time Home Buyer Credit, which is equal to 10% of the price of the home, up to $7500.    File now, don't wait.    The new law that is being discussed would add $7500 to the credit, but still only 10%.  So if your home was $75,000, you wouldn't get anything extra back.  If your home was $150,000 or more, you might get extra IF they make the law retroactive for homes closed in 2008.    If you do qualify again after the new law is passed, you can file an amended return, and get more money back.    I would not delay filing, because you never know how long it will take for them to fix it or if you'll qualify, and you'll really kick yourself for delaying filing, and thus delaying your refund, if it turns out you won't get any extra back.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	You bought the house in 08', so why wait to file, don't think they will make any changes  retroactive.

If they'd made it retroactive 10 years back, people who bought 10 years and one week ago would be ranting.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Luckily, I was within the requirements to take the credit so I did.  And with the new bill now in the house, the idea that I don't have to pay it back makes it even more attractive, not to mention I'll now be eligible for another $7500 on top of the original.  However, I do agree that the dates are strange.  Obviously, not everyone would be happy with the dates but hopefully, with the new bill, you'll meet the requirements.  Either way, when you look at the details of the entire stimulus bill (all 900 billion of it) you'll see that you'll be taken care of.  This credit is for home buyers only whereas other credits planned are for other groups.  I'm sure there's something in there for you so be patient and keep an eye on the current bill as it works its way through the house.    Good Luck!  Peace!  The Reverend    UPDATE:  Yourtabu is not 100% correct on that.  If the new bill passes, all homebuyers, not just first time buyers, will be eligible for the $15000 credit.  Furthermore, the House has revised the bill to REMOVE the "payback clause" on the original $7500 credit.  So, as you can see, provided the bill passes, no one will have to pay back the money.  Lots of folks fault Bush but at least Bush wasn't flat out GIVING the $ away.  Obama's plan is 100% FREE MONEY with no obligation to payback.

C233ATPvaa	Chinese treasury sells and buys reserves of American currency it holds to balance its Yuan vis-a-vis US dollar. Keeps a fixed exghange rate or managed float to ensure currency does not fly to high.     Given China's massive current account surplus it means American dollars are chasing to be converted into Chinese Yuan faster than vice versa, this demand if not have been controlled would have significantly increased China's currency.     Now when it delinks it means it is allowing the market (investors) to determine value of exchange rate. Not gov't treasury.
pt6wIlS1aa	Okay, let's make a distinction here.     *Giving* away your clothes is donating; you don't get paid. You can take a deduction for them on your taxes, though. You give or donate to places like Goodwill or the Salvation Army.    If you want to be paid for your clothes, you would *sell* them to a thrift shop. Just call the ones in the area and ask if they buy used clothes.    Some thrift shops are consignment shops. This means they will pay you something for your clothes once they sell them.     Just realize that to get paid for your used clothes, they have to be in good enough shape for someone to want to buy them. Usually this means they must look new or only slightly worn.

4Pk6VNftaa	If your tax situation is simple - didn't buy or sell a house, didn't sell stocks, no out of state income, etc. - then just do the taxes yourself.    People have found TurboTax to be pretty good at finding ways to cut your taxes or improve your refund.  Remember, any money you spend on tax software or on a tax preparer is also tax deductible.    If you do end up with a refund, you may want to redo your tax form at the payroll office so that the government isn't withholding so much money from your paychecks.  Remember, getting a refund on your taxes basically means you were lending that money to the government - interest free - for an entire year.  That's money you could have had in your pocket for bills, or at least in a savings account.    I think most tax preparers can help you figure out how to adjust your withholding so you come as close to $0 as possible.  You won't get a refund, but you won't owe anything either, and you'll have that extra money from each paycheck.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	so your HOH with 2 exemptions.  30000.00-8000.00 (HOH) -7000.00 (2exemptions) so 15000.00 in taxable income tax liability on  that is $1680.00. So you can get a child tax credit of $1000.00  so leaves you with 680.00 in liabilty. So federal w/h in box 2 of your W2's minus $680.00 plus EIC about $600.00.|`|WgT5l14baa	A big refund means that you did not update your W-4 with your employer and they're taking too much out.  A pro can charge you a big fee but can't change your facts.  They just fill out the forms.|`|c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	Going to a tax Professional be it H&R or another franchise brings some peace of mind. I work for Liberty and have done taxes professionally for 30 years. If you have no itemized deductions and will be using a straight forward 1040 form doing them by yourself and efiling is fine. With wages of 30K and filing head of household you should expect to see an earned income credit of about 634 and also a child tax credit of 1,000. Bring it in to a Liberty Tax Service office and we will look over your return for you and you will be under no obligation to file with us! Have a great day....    www.smarttax.com
1HLPznZhaa	I find this to be a strange question . Why do you ask ? what do you mean " what area or did you have ? " .  Makes no sense..Red flags are now flying...|`|Kwywmcs8aa	no but my hours are cut|`|9kg4eeCIaa	Yes laid of by my company 3 weeks ago in software development. 200 of us lost our jobs. its really frustrating for me ive always been doing something now nothing, cant find jobs. In saying this some statistics and economists say the IT sector is quite safe!.|`|sOJRn24paa	Not now but have been twice and I'm 27...I am a temp now, I feel because I have already lived it twice, I feel that I have enough stuff now, our cars are paid for, and I save every paycheck I get. When my husband and I buy a house...it will be under or around 70,000...I refuse to live paycheck to paycheck. Can't wait! I love watching my checking account grow each week for our home...I just can't wait. My husband live comfortably now with $950 a month as rent not including heat but it is just too much for me, going out.

meK0ziCJaa	If you have any revolving lines of credit, you should pay those down as much as possible, as fast as possible. For example, if you have a credit card(s) that have balances, pay those down or even better, pay them off completely. Pay all of your bills on time, never be late. If you have any accounts that are currently in collections, pay them! Try disputing the negative trade lines with the credit reporting agencies, that some times works. It's a shot in the dark.     If you do have outstanding debt, don't go to a third party to pay it off or have them negotiate lower terms. This doesn't work and you'll just be out of money in the long run. Anything they claim to do for you, you can do for yourself.|`|1HLPznZhaa	The best answer for that will come from the reporting agency..get in touch with them .. There are many factors that govern this but the biggest is income to debt ratio.. Good luck|`|CnM7MxaTaa	redit repair workd fine to fix my credit. They disputed and removed lots of bad items from my credit report. I used this service - creditreport.undonet.com|`|q1MC7dsDaa	There are many factors involved in calculating credit scores.  The most heavily weighted factor is the status of existing accounts.  If you do not have any current slows pays and all other negative items have been paid in full then your score is going to jump.  However, how much it jumps is closely tied to your current credit score.    Example:  If you are a 540 score you could easily see a 100 point jump.    Example:  If you are a 640 score you may only see a 50 point jump.    For more resources and help go to this site: http://you-theft.blogspot.com/
nmozvlGPaa	At this point it a proposal for the stimulus package and not a done deal.  It is a tax credit (although I am not sure if it like the current one that is more of an interest free loan that gets repaid over 15 years).  That means true tax credit of 10% of the value to a maximum of $15000.      The other way isn't such a great credit, now, is it?    good luck!|`|qBCGH52haa	As it is designed now, it is a tax credit, not an adjustment to AGI, thus whatever you owe or get back would be changed by the $15,000 (actually, it is a 10% of cost tax credit up to $15,000).  Of course, the credit is not in the House version of the bill and the Conference Committee will have to negotiate over the size and shape of this credit.|`|xJi3ixgGaa	It is my understanding that it is NOT retro active.  The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter.  Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place.  The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.      HOWEVER this is where a lot of people don't understand.  Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000.  You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000.  You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10.  If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars.  For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.
irxnnhnEaa	You can break your lease for any reason....but be prepared to pay all the fees associated with breaking your lease....it could be quite costly.|`|AA11206283	Was it there when you moved in?    Did a mouse scare it  in there?    If it's in working condition, I don't think you have anything here.|`|AA11215123	Why would that matter? And why question it now?|`|kPWGVeWhaa	If it was there when you originally looked at it...probably not.|`|w4OGnyn8aa	Lol, no. The furnace is usually in some kind of enclosure i.e. a closet. Why would you break the lease for that?|`|lXEvMuJBaa	If it is "up to code" you are out of luck.  If it's not, and the landlord won't make it so within a certain amount of time, you probably could and should move out.
