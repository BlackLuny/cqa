Lyjy3xO7aa	Until the government changes the law that requires banks to make bad loans, (by making illegal to 'discriminate" against people just because they can't pay), they're not going to make the loans.  The banks consider themselves lucky to have gotten back the money from the bad loans that are already out there.   The last thing the banks want to do now is go out and make even more bad loans.  Especially if the Government is then going to demonize them for doing what the law that they passed requires of them. They'll take the money and invest it in other things, and get out of the home mortgage business altogether.

aGzh5e7Haa	Payment history is the single most important factor in determining your credit score, making up 35% of the total. Since recent history carries more weight than what happened five years ago, getting in the habit of making on-time payments is an incredibly powerful way to start rebuilding your credit rating.     Likewise, delinquent payments can devastate your score. Missing even one payment can knock 50 to 100 points off a good score. Skipping payments for a single month on all your bills can lower your number from a respectable 707 to the dismal range of 562 to 632, according to the credit score estimator at Bankrate.com. The simulator lets you estimate your credit score and see the impact of various credit behaviors on your score.     Tip: I've found the best way to avoid late payments is to put as many of our bills on automatic as possible. Our mortgage lender, utilities and phone service providers are happy to take their payments directly from our checking account each month. Online bill-payment systems are another way to ease monthly check-writing chore, and many provide reminder services so you don't forget a bill. The latest versions of Quicken and Money have good reminder features, as well.|`|gMgRVCDeaa	Beki and Judy are right! Another tip to get higher scores is to open new credit card accounts but never or rarely use them. And get the highest amount of $$$ on them that they will give you. The more credit you have available the better your score, generally, will be. The secret is to have all these approved and open accounts with nice high $$$ ceilings available so the 3 credit bureaus can see 'em. This will help you FICO numbers, just don't run up balances!|`|qArX5LYdaa	Ask lenders for agreement to delete this items from your credit report when paying them. I recommend to get such agreement thru credit repair agency, for example this one - credit-report-free.totalh.com|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Pay those balances off and watch your score skyrocket.  It is 100% myth that carrying balances increases your scores.  Something old ladies will tell you.  The opposite is quite true.  Use your card for things you need like food or gas, and pay it in full each month.    Never pay a penny interest.  /

OnnwkKZnaa	OK, here is the situation.  The short answer to your question is: no.  Here is why.  Right now, the mortgage market is pretty tight.  Banks are limiting exposures and that means not finacing more than 80% of the value of a home.  Now you could get PMI, but in today's market that is going to be pricey especially with the credit issues.  For a 119k home, you would need to come to closing with about 24k plus closing costs.  So I figure about 27k in cash.  Unfortunately, you're pretty far off from that.    However, the real issue is your credit worthiness.  Let's face it, just like when you lend your friend money, the bank is going ask itself whether or not you are likely to be able to pay it back.  based on your FICO score, you have had issues with paying back loans/credit in the past.  People with low scores used to be able to get subprime loans, but that is one of the main causes of the economic meltdown.      The problem is that, negative information can hang around on your credit history for up to 7 years.  So you may have some time before you see that score tick upward in a big way.  In the meantime, start saving for that downpayment.  Also, even though it will not help your history, make sure that you don't have any past due or collections on your report.  The first thing mortgage bank is going to look at is who you owe money to.  If there is a chance that someone could file a judgement against you and hurt your ability to pay your mortgage, they will not finance you.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	I HIGHLY doubt it.  You credit score is about equal to the credit score that my dog has and you have less than a 5% downpayment.  You will need AT LEAST $25,000 - $30,000 to even dream about it!  Good Luck|`|kyBZhNMpaa	Probally not. You need to pay off whats on your credit first. We looked into it a few weeks back and thats what we were told.

5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	W-2's are an employer's record of wages/salary, plus taxes and any benefits withheld to every employee paid money during a calendar year.  The employer is required to send a W-2 to each employee by January 31, the year following the year in question.  (So your W-2 form for 2008 should be postmarked by your employer no later than January 31, 2009.)  The W-2 has several copies.  You file one with your federal tax return, one with your state tax return if your state collects income taxes, and you keep one for your records.  The employer is also required to send a copy of all W-2's (on a form called a W-3,) to the federal government.  Therefore, if the income you claim doesn't match up with the copy your employer sent to them, the IRS will want to have a few words with you.  Thus, the W (or Wage) forms act as a check and balance to ensure all employees pay the proper income taxes.  If you have further question, the IRS has an extensive website, www.irs.gov .|`|1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	Your W2 is the form from your employer that states what you made through out the calendar year and where your money went (IRA, paid to you, taxes). You send it in with your taxes to show your individual income tax liability. You need it to fill out your tax forms, although your last pay stub of the year may have most of the same information.
f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	Stock splits are events that increase the number of shares outstanding and reduce the par or stated value per share.  For example, a two-for-one stock split would double the number of shares outstanding and halve the par value per share.     In this case, Abbott would triple its no. of shares outstanding, and its par value would drop to one third its original par value, so the answer is D. is reduced to $7 per share.
1cFUXQuRaa	CVP analysis is used to build an understanding of the relationship  between costs, business volume, and profitability. The analysis focuses on the interplay of pricing, volume, variable and fixed costs, and product mix. This analysis will drive decisions about what  products to offer, how to price them, and how to manage an organizations cost structure. CVP is at the heart of techniques that are useful for calculating the break-even point, volume levels necessary to achieve targeted income levels, and similar computations. The starting point for these calculations is to consider the contribution margin.    When speaking of the contribution margin, one might be referring to aggregated data, per unit data, or ratios.    Beware that using only Unit cost can be misleading. Once classic example is Fixed costs. They are fixed in Total within a relevant range of activity, not on a per unit basis. Unitizing means to make that TOTAL into a per unit rate/ basis, & this if not done carefully can be misleading.    For example If fixed costs are $20,000 and variable costs are $100 per unit, then as quantity moves from 100 to 200, variable costs per unit remain $100 but fixed costs per unit changes from $200 to $100. Making decisions based on a fixed cost per unit is deceptive if quantity can change.    Cheers...
7QPv7ta7aa	As long as the items are within the 7 year reporting period, it is very possible that they will reappear the next time the collection agency updates to the credit bureaus.      If the items do show up again and you want to pay them off, be sure to ask for pay for delete -- you pay $x and they delete the item from all credit reports.  You can probably settle for about 25%.  Get any settlement agreement in writing and don't give the collector direct access to your bank account.|`|AA11173563	it is very possible if they do not delete it completely from the tapes they send in monthly it will come back again.

If they do come back, dispute then IMMEDIATELY.|`|AA12065007	It's possible, when you dispute something the credit bureaus have 30 days to verify it or they must by law remove the information from your report.    The thing is that sometimes the information comes in after the 30-day limit has expired and gets put back on your report the next month.|`|VUv70RtPaa	i sure hope not!|`|OacSIfSiaa	Under the FCRA regulations, if a disputed entry is removed, they (the CRA) has to send you an updated credit report explaining that the disputed items were removed.    IF you did not get a new report after you disputed the items, then I would question the source where you recently received your credit reports.  Did you get them directly from the CRA's? or are you using one of those credit monitoring services?  Many of those types are not up to date and are not true credit reports.    I do not mean to dampen your hopes, just want to make sure you understand how these things work.

Gi6cpZmuaa	It sounds like despite the economic hardships, you are remaining on a capital and interest repayment mortgage. This is very wise, as far too many people are moving to Interest Only to keep their payments down (needless to say, such an arrangement would mean you are not paying any of your mortgage off, and the term of the mortgage would make no difference if you chose to do this).    Once you have completed your remortgage to a new 35 year arrangement, you will not be able to change the term until you are up for remortgage again. In and of itself, this should not be a problem for you, as your new lender should offer a facility to pay more then your regular monthly installment when you are in a position to do so. Be sure to find out that the new lender offers this facility, most high street lenders do, however.    The move Down Under will not be a concern for the lender so long as the payments are maintained satisfactorily and appropriate landlord's insurance covers the property. If you want to be sure, ask the lender for a consent to let when you move, though most will charge you an admin cost for doing this.

t57Gp7MEaa	The reason the IRS states that you will get your refund on the 10th is to allow time for your bank to process it. If they said the 6th, those who did not receive their refund to due to slow bank processing times would be swamping the IRS with phone calls. This is just a "safety" feature of the IRS to avoid all of those angry phone calls. Many people, myself included, have received refunds on a Friday before. It ALL depends on your bank.|`|eojDX3itaa	Here is what is happening: the IRS releases funds to the  banks on Fridays only (so this week's batch of returns   will release on the 6th), but the banks themselves tend  to hold these funds over the weekend and often do not  credit them to the taxpayer's account until that next  Tuesday (the 10th in this case). It is an industry-wide  practice on the part of the banks.    Robyn M.

5XDfjq4Naa	2 things to be aware of-    1.  If you're applying for a job that requires that you fill out an application, rather than attend a formal interview after you send an employer a resume, you probably don't have much to worry about.    The person looking over applications most likely does not have extensive experience in HR.    At the same time, you don't want to advertise that you may be susceptible to irritation in the workplace so easily, so you would not want to write "left because boss was rude."    Try writing "management," and nothing more.  When you make it to an interview, it may come up, and it gives you the perfect chance to be honest about the situation after the employer has met with you and has already made some sort of general assessment of your value as a potential employee.      Do not be emotional when giving your answer, and don't give examples of your ex-employer's "rudeness" unless asked.  Otherwise, you will seem as though you are easily excited.    2.  If you have recently left that position and a paycheck is still owed to you, don't write an end date to your employment and check the box that says that the company where you are applying CAN NOT contact the employer.    If time has passed to where there is now a gap in your employment, let them check.    Most employers are very aware that in the USA there is a lot of liability to what kind of a reference they can make.    95% of employers will not even give details other than the amount of time an employee was at a company, their wages, if they are eligible for rehire or not, and if they were fired or left on their own.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I would never put on a job application that I left because my boss was rude, all bosses can be rude when they want to be.  I know they should not be rude but that's the way it is sometimes.  I would put down on the application form that my hours were cut and I wanted to work more hours rather then less.  If you should get an interview and this is brought up then perhaps you could say you wanted more hours and the boss turned nasty/rude and that's why you left.  You need to impress your new employer that you are a hard worker not that you cannot get on with a boss.|`|ogLHkR0oaa	The truth, Incompatibility with employer and methods of employment !|`|tQMfV2txaa	Say that you were looking for more hours than he could give you.

S5H0NmEWaa	If you resign at any time before you have been dismissed, it is not a dismissal.    You should always be entitled to all your wages and tax. You should discuss with an HR person what you will get and check any discrepancies as soon as you know that you are leaving (ie you have resigned or been dismissed).    Also, are you sure the company has your tax money? Normally you go on an emergency tax code and you pay more than you should have paid to HM Customs & Revenue out of your pay packet, which means that you need to contact them to get the money reimbursed, not your employer.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	If you feel you are fighting a lost cause resign.

The IRS had no record of receiving our return. Then HSBC said they would not do the loan. We were not even aware that we had applied for a loan. We had never discussed a RAC. Now, all of the sudden, we should get the direct deposit today. Let's see what happens.    H & R Block told us we should get it today on Monday. Today they are saying it will be another week.

paerqxfMaa	In this economy, alot of people are having the same issue.

LqSciCrhaa	Social,    The best thing to do is what your grandmother taught you years ago.    SIt down with your boyfriend and add up all of your expenses.  Everything from food, gas, utilities, entertainment, etc...    Figure out what that numer is and then start saving for three months of expenses and ONLY use that money if you lose a job.  It is going to feel really hard to do but it will give you a cushion should you lose a job.      If you get to 3 months of savings then bump it up to six months.  You won't need to go any higher than 6 months.      IN order to get your rainy day fund you may need to cut back on some expenses such as eating out, going to movies, beer or whatever it is you do for fun.  Losing your job and then your home won't be worth the fun you are having now.    Good luck Pai and don't give up.|`|WngxQDiaaa	I'm sorry to hear of your boyfriend losing his job.

As for your cars, credit cards, and others especially if you got hosed by the realestate meltdown. Call and explain, and send a letter with   partale payments. If a credit card company desides to take you to court. Make sure to show up. Bring you canceled checks they cashed.  If the judges see an attempt to pay even if your only sending 20.00 on  a 10,000 credit card bill the judge will say thats all they can afford, and you either exept the payment, or dismise the charges.The same rules apply to real estate. My freind could no longer make the mortgage :) :)payment, and maint fee charge for his condo.So the plan was when the mortgage of 1,800 was due send 1,000 the maint went to 500 send 200. The main co will put a lien but if you dont have it you can't pay. know the payment is 1,250 per month the same as if he was renting. But when he arrived in court with the bank pushing foreclosure he pledge with the bank in front of a judge, and said the varible rate, and rising maint fees had run up his credit cards and he no longer was able to pay but just what he could send them.   The end result the bank was forced to rewrite the loan to 1,100.00  the main fee is still locked on but if when, and if he sells the back maint will be written into the sale. The moral.He gets to pocket 700 per month, bad credit yes but look @ it like this thats 8,400 per year in his pocket no enoying credit card offers after 10 years he will have 84k in savings account I rather have cash then credit!!!!!|`|9bgsyndIaa	Budget; get rid of all luxuries like cable tv, eating out.  2nd job for you, boyfriend must accept any job right now and get a 2nd one.

Giant generators that can power entire cities. A new design for an airplane's electrical system. Electrical and electronics engineers work on high-tech projects like these.    Electrical engineers design new and better electronics. They also test equipment and solve problems. A project starts by deciding what the new electronics will do. Then, the engineer designs the circuits and other parts of the electronics. Engineers might draw their designs using a computer.     Later, the engineers test their designs and make them better. Many projects don't work at first. The engineers have to figure out why and then fix them.    Electrical engineers work on many kinds of products. They might work on cars, robots, cell phone systems, the lighting and wiring in buildings, and radar and navigation systems, for example.     Engineers work in offices, labs, or industrial plants. Many work a normal 40-hour week. At times, they work longer to meet deadlines.

DisdrG4Taa	I have to wonder if your grades were too low for the psych program, how you plan on being accepted into medical school or a nursing program.  Currently nursing programs are among the most competitive college programs for admission.  In 2005 over 147,000 qualified applicants were rejected, not to include the number of borderline and unqualified applicants.    You need to go an talk to the career/education counselors at your school.  Let them discuss your grades and options, and the career paths available with different majors.  They also are able to provide testing to determine where your personality and aptitudes are likely to be best suited.    Otherwise, at this point you are probably just going to waste more money in student loans changing majors, until you find your niche.I had many friends in college who spent 6, 7 or 8 years working on their undergraduate degrees, because they would start a semester, and drop the courses they didn't like or weren't understanding.  And then change their major.    Seek counseling before you make this decision.    EDIT: Sorry for the misunderstanding.  I know you are interested in psychology, and it is a fascinating subject area. You might want to consider going to a nursing program, then working in a psychiatric facility.  Then further your education by getting a masters degree as a psychiatric nurse practitioner, or I have known many psychiatric nurses who then were accepted into psychology masters programs.  The advantage of going to nursing school is the ability to start working right after graduation.  Many of the psychiatric nurse practitioner programs are set up to allow the students to work and attend school at the same time. There is also the Psychiatric Mental Health Clinical Nurse Specialist who works with psychiatric patients.  The PsyNPs have a focus on the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions in inpatient, outpatient and private practice settings.  They are able to prescribe medications to help with any counseling that may be recommended.    Going to nursing school still leaves you with many mental health options, but also opens a world of other health care options.  One issue is having to go through the process of learning the medical surgical nursing that is the foundation which most nursing schools are based upon.    Good luck in the future.|`|e98af447d889fc4d0fa1016941966d10aa	There you have it. You did state that you wanted to be able to assist people in, perhaps, third world countries. Nursing may very well be the best alternative to being a physician. and still will not prevent you from obtaining a certification as a nurse practitioner or physicians assistant or just simply being able to observe the profession that you are torn about from a different perspective . There are many in poor countries who could use your help and love. Keep you your doors open and as you travel doors that are yet to be opened may bring great surprises

WgT5l14baa	Yes, you can charge at the time of the order.  It's legal.  That doesn't mean it's a good idea.  I do a lot of mail order my self and very few vendors charge prior to actual shipment.  (almost none)  In fact, my experience has been that if part of the order is delayed, they will bill for each part as it is shipped.  If you do this, expect to have customer relations problems, since the customer may never have seen the practice before.  Also, expect some charge-backs, because some of your customers may dispute the charge on their credit statement on the grounds that they have been charged for merchandise not received.  (Most banks will accept this as a valid reason and take the charge off the customer's account.)              Note: the "statute of limitations" has nothing to do with this situation.|`|AA12340941	I wouldn't do it.  Could cause a lot of problems down the line and why would you want to charge them now if they can't get if for a few months?  That doesn't seem fair.|`|xHoq5Ga8aa	Yes, it is legal. Simply place an advisory to the customer. Many companies do so.

The next phone call says that even though she hasn't worked here in months, missed a meeting she needs more days off?    This is becoming more trouble than it's worth.    By the way legally you are no longer an employee there so they can say you weren't fired you quit.

If you are in the country or a small city/town you will need a car.    I have taken the tests and this is the information they give you at the test.     There are two tests, a general enumerator test that takes 30 minutes and a supervisor test that takes 1 hour.  Be sure you bring the ID outlined on the web site.

uWJU9uAuaa	You could try, but there are several consequences:  1. They could issue you a 1099C to the IRS, for the "forgiven" part of the debt (that would be for principal only, not interest and fees).  You would owe taxes on that amount.    2.  They could sell the unpaid portion to collection agency, who will then harass you probably.    3.  They will mark your credit report as "setteled for less than owed" or some such notation, which will hurt your reports for 7 years and kill your utilization (how much of your credit you are using, which amount to 30% of your total score).    In my opinion, your best bet would be to ask them if they could lower your interest rate to help you pay it off.    Since you have no bad marks (except one payment) on your reports, I would do anything possible to protect your credit rating while at the same time paying off the card.  If you put $15k towards the CC, but kept up your current min payments (if possible), you will start to ses significant progress each month, as long as you don't add to the balance.    Also, some banks reserve the right to offset "bad debt".  So if your card has a $10k balance on it, but you hold other accounts at the institution, they have the right to take money out of those accounts (such as your kids' savings) to offset their loss.  Something else to consider.    GOOD LUCK!|`|XXIpmAL4aa	I would move all except minimum balances of cash out of that bank so they can't exercise right of offset and freeze the funds.  Then work with them on the debt.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	FYI - you may wind up having to pay taxes on the $10,000 of "Forgiven Debt" -  and it may be a negative mark on your credit record - IF they even agree to it.  If you are NOT behind in payments, I doubt they will negotiate with you    why don;t you just get current with the loans or pay one off totally and then use the savings of not having that one loan to accelerate payoff of the other balances?|`|AA12250678	I think that they can take the balance owed from any other accounts you hold,  I would get some legal advice before you make the offer

YQ1Q7XeEaa	As an HR manager I can honestly say she isn't contacting you because she doesn't have an answer.  (although I think it's bad form to not respond to an email saying they'll contact you as soon as they have a next step.    On the upside it is incredibly promising that they flew you in.  It probably means that if you were local they would hire you in an instant.      On the downside they have slowed the process which could mean anything from the hiring managers are too busy with other work to make this decision yet to they have made their choice and are holding you in reserve in case one of their local candidates don't work out.    I would just try to touch base once per week just to keep you top of mind.  Any more than that and you risk alienating the HR rep - never a good thing.    Best of luck!

Can the other person verify income for 2 years and is their credit good and then lastly do you want them as a co-owner in this home. Can you qualify only on your income. Now building a credit file takes time as any new account that is not seasoned with a pay history will not add any thing to your scores for almost 1 year.

PMI will cost thousands that is not tax deductible, or goes towards principal or interest.  It's like throwing money away.  Banks are now requiring 10% down for those with perfect credit.  Save up a bit - you'll get there.  If you get a credit card - pay in full each month for top notch 800+ scores.  Carrying balances can destroy your credit worthiness.  Open a checking account immediately if you don't have one already - see if they will let you have a credit card.  /|`|gMgRVCDeaa	Judy is right! I'll suggest aiming for maybe 5 years down the road unless you have a ton of money behind you. At your age many lenders will not offer a good rate. You'll need a stable and reasonable income and clean credit background to get a good rate.     If you split a mortgage then the other party must have equal or better credit to get those good rates. I'm assuming you are going to both sign the mortgage papers. If it's just you signing, then you are obligated to pay the full amount for the full term of the note. If the other party moves out, you still must pay the full amount if sign the note alone. Good luck!|`|N956bVxhaa	You need to have a very large income.  If you don't make at least $90k a year, forget this whole idea.      Second, don't count on anyone paying half your mortgage for you.  It's only a matter of time before circumstances change and you're in the new house all by yourself.    Third, to build up a credit score, you need to borrow money and pay it back.  So either take out a loan or open a credit card and don't forget to pay it back.    Overall, a bad idea. Houses are not liquid assets. That means it could take a very long time to sell it if you wanted to move.

4MypYVHYaa	There are tax lien states and tax deed states. Any tax lien wipes our any mortgage on the property. The only lien that is not wiped out by a tax lien is an IRS lien.    If the property owner brings the taxes current the county will charge them interest which is yours plus the amount you invested in the tax lien itself.    The tax lien state will sell you a tax lien of those that owe back taxes. After a certain period of time if the person fail to bring the taxes current you get possession of the property.    In a tax deed state you would have to wait for the tax sale. At this tax sale the highest bidder is awarded the property. Again if there is a mortgage on the property and the mortgage company does not step forward and pay the taxes then the mortgage is wipe clean.    You have to find out if your state is a tax deed state or a tax lien state.     I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.

Good luck!|`|PNwVJ2hSaa	This is a false premise... the only way to buy a house for just the back taxes is if the homeowner owes NOTHING on the property to a mortgage company. What you're REALLY doing is buying the right to collect on those taxes in most states. You are allowed to charge interest too. Buying a house for unpaid back taxes does not wipe out the bank's first interest in the property. THEY own the house, you don't. However, if there is no bank involved, then yes, you can repossess the house in its entirety if the owner of the house doesn't pay the taxes due within a specified amout of time. But quite often, for a home with 100% equity, the homeowner can just get an equity loan to pay the taxes off before the house becomes yours.

z3TIcyI6aa	No they wouldn't!   Unless you are going bankrupt and the Official Receiver will go through bank statements etc.    if your sending creditors income and expenditure they usually don't ask for bank statements unless it's to prove your getting benefits etc.    Ignore the other people, by the way.   Sometimes creditors are not the most important thing.

But anyway it's your choice if you do get money from a will what you want to do with it.    It WOULD be better if you paid them off as debts can follow you for years if your not paying them very much.

But, I am only buying here in CA, I am not sure what the bidding practices are elsewhere.   It will be market specific.    In my market the banks just throw out a number, even an all cash offer at the list price is not likely to be accepted, the list price does not really have a great deal of meaning with an REO.|`|OZjOqI43aa	no, why would you want to pay more money? i would either bid the actual asking price or try and negotiate it a little and ask for a bit less.|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	Only if there are multiple offers on the same house|`|b5b22241b72a751e94c18311e3dd0dddaa	Only in California.|`|o0aFrez9aa	If its brand new to the market and you're concerned about competing with other offers that could be coming in before they agree to your offer than yes, going over the asking price, just a little, isn't uncommon. It also makes for a stronger deal later if you end up asking the seller for repairs to the property after a home inspection. (make sure you get one) Also consider asking for a 1 Year Home Warranty in your offer. "The Warranty Group" offers them for $419.00 a year. Its a small expense for the seller and is great for you cause never know what you're getting especially with a foreclosure.  (Just FYI, you can also purchase the warranty yourself in the seller wont.)   One thing to keep in mind with all this is that unless you're paying cash, a bank won't lend more money on a property than its worth so if you offer a few grand over the asking price and then the appraised value comes in low, your purchase price will basicly drop to that appraised value. Usually by the time the appraisel comes in the deal is just about finished and ready close so it doesn't affect the strength of you inital offer but if the appraisel comes in earlier than when you ask for repairs that may effect how much they'll agree to do. Hope all that wasn't too confusing. :) Good Luck!|`|AA11206283	nope. Not unless they is a deal on closing costs, future taxes or liens.

pDSlV0Jnaa	It is customary to give 2 weeks notice before leaving a job.  That allows your present employer time to find a replacement or make arrangements to cover your duties.  You do not need to tell your boss that you are leaving because of him.  All you need to say is that your are pursuing another opportunity.  If your company has an HR department they may conduct an exit interview with you, which would allow you to express your discontent with your boss in confidence.  You need to do what is best for you.  Your boss and the company will survive without you, despite your concern for their needs.  Move on and be happier .|`|mh0QRDE9aa	If the new job is with a different company, then take it.  Give your boss a weeks notice and just leave.  If he asks why, tell him the truth.  He may not realize what he is doing, but it will wake him up.  If he asks you to stay, tell him yes, but not under the present conditions.  Good Luck!

You can however contact your local labor board and file a complaint and also fill out a Human rights paper stating your rights as an employee has been violated and then she can quit and collect unemployment for being forced to leave her employment due to harassment and unbearable work conditions.

Her best bet would be to stand up to the supervisor, she may get fored for it, but if he is really that bad then she should have quit already anyhow.
qxrr69bnaa	Your body will adjust to it.  What is hard adjusting to with shift work is rotating shifts, where you change shifts every week or so--7-3, 3-11, and 11-7.  If you are able to stay on one shift, you do adjust.  At most jobs on the graveyard shift, there is usually less to do than during the other shifts.  You should have a night differential pay.  More money is a nice incentive.  Usually you have less supervision on the graveyard shift.|`|3mAgM405aa	The best part of working on a graveyard job, is not having a supervisor around and less people contact.  Go for it!

vOlMa6wqaa	Take the check and your mom/sister to the bank and ask them what you need to do. They may let you cash the check by your self or have you sign the check over to your mom/sister. If you have to sign it over, the bank may make them deposit it first and it may have to have a hold on it. If there is enough in the account, they then can withdrawal the amount of the check form the account but if there are not enough funds in the account then you will have to wait till the check clears. If they don't make you deposit the check, they may let you cash the check but with a fee. OR you can take the check to a place that cashes checks like Walmart or other stores. They have check cashing fee as well but most of the time their fees are less than that of a bank.  Good Luck!!!
vVTmJjJDaa	the deposit is part of the 160.    edit:  however, most deposits in this type of situation are non-refundable...this is to help ensure that those who sign up are actually going to follow through.  so, in other words, you'll want to make *sure* you really want to go before you pay the deposit.|`|xKY5TjOlaa	no its a part of the 160
5Gxll9Hkaa	This is actually a math problem, not a Personal Fanance problem.    Of course it would make a difference.  Think of it this way:    Suppose I have a bag of stones that come in 4 colors: red, blue, green and yellow, with an equal number of each.    Then suppose that you were to guess which colors of stones I would pull out of my bag when I reach in with my eyes closed 2x and pick out 2 stones.  (Just to make this similar to the lottery, suppose further that each time I reach in and pick out a stone, a friend of mine replenishes my bag with another stone of the same color as the one I just picked out.)    Okay so which is the harder problem:  for you to try to guess which 2 colors of stones I would pull out in 2 successive picks?  Or for you to guess IN THE RIGHT ORDER which 2 colors of stones I would pull out.  In some cases it wouldn't matter; for example, if I pull out one blue stone and another blue stone and you said I'd pick "blue and blue" you are right in either case.  But if I reach in and pull out a blue stone the first time and a red stone the second time, and you guessed that I'd pick "red and blue" you'd only be right if order didn't matter.  If order DID matter, you'd be wrong.    So which is the harder guess to make:  when order counts or when order doesn't count?    The reason it is harder to guess correctly when order does count is because your odds of guessing correctly are lower than they are when order doesn't count.    Does that help answer your question?  I hope so.

I had a huge swing a few years ago from the $40k range to well into the 6 figures too, and I noticed I suddenly became 'hot property'. It sickened me.

BTW- my wife couldn't care less about our income.  I don't live flashy, and I don't have the risks and rewards of that lifestyle. Instead, I have a comfortable life and income and plenty put away in savings and IRA's.|`|OYWJ12mJaa	Congrats on your good fortune, but 6 digits is good but not all it use to be.  So get your head out of your %$ %$ %  first.    Now to answer your question.    Maybe not telling them would be first.  Not driving a sports car would help not be so obvious too. basically don't be flashy.  Try to do the simple things in life that you enjoy and see if she has mutual reactions.  Be thrifty buy not cheap and see how reacts to that.  Let her pick up a few tabs, if you end up paying for everythingor 70% of the bill, it's time to move on.    Good luck
Bw1h5xAcaa	Most programs require a minimum of a C in those science courses that are most often pre-reqs to the nursing program, which includes biology. So technically you'll qualify. But if your chosen school has competative admission where overall GPA is going to factor in, then that C is going to pull down your GPA.     If I were you, I would ask the school specifically about the weight of your GPA factoring into admissions, and ask what the average GPA is for admission. Base your decision on whether you should retake the class on that.|`|PXplwKsVaa	depends on what school you want to go to..if you want to be a nurse you do need to work on the biology|`|2f4975193b57940e7f9279bfdf804faeaa	it seems that of those courses, human biology is the most directly related to nursing. i'd work to pull that one up.
AA11404742	Ask your realtor - he/she will hopefully be up on the real estate law in this case.  And their expertise is part of what you're paying for here.    But let me add this thought - if the sellers are selling the house in "as is" condition, that tells me you're getting it at a fairly low price, at least for that market, and that you expect at least some things to be in a run-down state.  Do you really think that the appliances that were there would be in excellent condition?  My guess is that at least some of them were probably getting fairly old, and may not have had a lot of years left in them.  Their value may have only been a few hundred dollars.    Yes, you'll probably spend at least $3000 to get new appliances, but hopefully you'll get many years of use from them.  If you can't get the old ones back easily, I wouldn't expend a lot of tears missing them.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Unless the seller's agent has a power of attorney, his signature on the addendum is useless.  That said, did your offer specifically state all appliances included?  If your offer is mute on that subject then you probably don't have any grounds to object.      realtor.sailor|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Its possible that the previous owners retained a key and came and stole the appliances. The bank would not remove appliances because they know they are part of the sale.     You should contact your realtor, and work through him/her to inform the bank that if the appliances are not there, you'll expect to change the offer accordingly and/or you will retract your offer.     If you continue to move forward with this purchase, I suggest you do a walk-through before you sign. Ask your Realtor to meet you at the house a few hours before you are scheduled to go to the title company to sign the paperwork. Just do a quick walk through to make sure everything is in the condition you are expecting, and make sure the fixtures and appliances you are expecting are there. This is your last chance to back out if something has been changed. This is always a good idea, but given your situation, I would say its essential.     If you do purchase the house, make sure the 1st thing you do is change the locks. Again, this is always wise, but it looks a lot like a previous owner has a key, and that this person is not morally against using their key to get in and steal things.

C2h2f4cdaa	I wouldn't be so quick to write off your Business Administration degree. The skills that you have picked up in finance, IT, human resources and marketing can be applied to many different sectors. For example, have you thought of a career in Government or the voluntary sector? The whole of point of a Business Admin degree is that it is broad enough for you to fit in just about anywhere.    By all means go for a further qualification in computer science, but there is no guarantee that it will get you a job.

qWaYbxcxaa	There is an old adage on Wall Street is:    "never try to catch a falling knife."    The price of one stock vs another does not compare apples to apples.

But there are plenty of non professional speculators who will take that trade. Not I said the cat.      The technical value of BAC like all the major banks right now is zero.

When you file bankruptcy all the creditors have to do is go in and remove the outstanding balance and they must list that this debt is included in bankrupcty. So as long as these things have been done that is all that is required. I do know some will go in and delete their entire entry but they don't have too.|`|AA11966821	Any debts which were not discharged in the bankruptcy must be paid.  So the one which says "included in Chap 7 bankruptcy" should be discharged, but it will remain on your credit report for 10 years after discharge.  (Foreclosures & bankruptcies stay on credit report for 10 years; other items for 7 years.)      What are the other 6 items?  Were they included in the bankruptcy or not?  If not discharged in the bankruptcy, you still have to pay.  And they will remain on your report for 7 years after the account is paid in full and closed.    You cannot get any of these items removed from your report!  Only errors can be removed.

If you are up for a challenge I think it would be worth it.     This would be a really great thing to have on a resume with companies who do a lot of business in South America or Europe.

OacSIfSiaa	No, neither federal nor state tax refunds are subject to creditor garnishment or seizure. Tax refunds can only be seized or garnished for, taxes that are due, child support, federally funded student loans and in some cases spousal maintenance (alimony).     Hope this answers your question.|`|RLctAANxaa	I highly doubt that unless that debt was to the IRS...|`|JiUwpYSXaa	What they could do if the have judgement is to attach you checking account when the return comes in.

The one who usually take refunds are for student loans|`|AaoclPYCaa	Not unless they went to court and got it in an award and that is not very likely.

DRZl5Dr2aa	10,745 minus the standard deduction of 5,450 = 5,295.  5,295 minus your exemptions of 3,500 = 1795.  1795 would be your taxable income.  Tax on $1,795 would be $179.  That means that you paid 1074 but you only owed 179. 1074 minus 179 = 895 which is your refund (give or take the 4 dollars for rounding decimal points and other anomalies).    However, you should qualify for a larger refund.  As a student you should be able to deduct tuition and fees and possibly student loan interest paid and you probably qualify for either the hope tax credit or the lifetime learning credit (unless your parents claimed those credits).  If you are over age 25 you should also qualify for the EIC (earned income credit).  All of these should make your refund bigger and possibly even more than the 1074 that you paid.  Your KY taxes could be lower as well depending on how KY does their tax system and how your possible deductions affect your AGI.    A couple of tips.  1 Don't use the 1040ez form.  Use the standard 1040 form or maybe the 1040a form.  These forms include more deductions and credits that should be applicable to your situation.  2 you are referring to your 2008 taxes not 2009.  These are taxes paid in 2008 for government use in 2008 and you are only filing the return in the calendar year 2009 for a return of the overpaid taxes in 2008. (I hate to nit-pick but that's information to you just in the name of accuracy).  3 you might want to claim more exemptions on your W-4 with your employer.  You way overpaid last year.  Think of paying taxes like paying for anything else.  If you buy a car for $10 and pay with a 100 dollar bill you will get $90 change back because you paid to much.  Your tax refund is getting your change back from overpaying the government.  If you change your W-4 you could pay closer to the amount you actually owe (close to zero if not zero) and have a larger paycheck, but a smaller refund when you do your tax return.   4 You are not getting screwed even if you only get $899 refund.  Paying taxes is how we fund the government (roads, schools, military protection and any of the other thousands of services [seen and unseen]) that the government provides to you and the rest of us.  Consider yourself lucky for paying so little to get so much.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	YOU  HAVE   TAXABLE   INCOME - THAT'S WHY!    Why would you expect to get ALL your taxes refunded???    being a student is irrelevant - you made more than the deductions and exemptions allow, so you wound up with taxable income - simple as that    In most states, you don;t get ANY refund for the state return -     the idea with withholding taxes is to have enough withheld to pay you  tax liability. period.  - no one is ENTITLED to a refund. wouldn't you prefer to have more money in your take home pay every payday??? If yes, then decrease the amount of tax you have withheld - W-4 form. a big refund means the government has free use of your money between the time it is deducted and the time you file your tax return|`|1kke1Ps7aa	The money you did not get back is known as TAXES.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	You earned above the minimum threshold, some of your withholdings (specifcally SS and Medicare, need to be paid.  Hence, you only receive part of your tax paid back.    Your GF earned even more, so she also has to pay some.    Be grateful, most people get back only a very small fraction of their withholdings.  The rest is what the government keeps to operate.  That's how it works.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	OK - check out the tax tables - single with an AGI of $1,725 - $1,750 pays $174.    If you had been taxed on the whole amount, your tax would have been $1,208 so you would have owed another $150.    The idea is to have your employer withhold the proper amount of tax - you shouldn't expect to get a refund nor have to pay more. It should be a breakeven kind of thing.|`|19ef1f40055827e18830d8ef16273953aa	Your income is taxable, so not getting back all you paid in is showing just that.

2N6oTOLQaa	Yes, but its still a rip off deal.     You aren't getting a $7500 tax credit, you are getting a $7500 loan against your future tax refunds because it is a credit that you must pay back. Plus it creates all kinds of opportunities for you to mess up the paperwork somewhere so the IRS can rip you a new one.     Personally, I'd pass on the credit. If you need a $7500 loan then go to a bank.
qpv1CP4caa	Hi Chris. Web development is absolutely a good career choice right now, especially for the more technical positions like coders and developers.    It's true that the economy is hitting everyone, and with the layoffs there's a lot of competition out there, but I see web developer jobs listed every single day. On Craigslist, on Monster, on Dice. Go to the Craigslist for the city nearest you and search for "web developer". You'll see tons of jobs, and doing this will also show you what skills the hiring companies are looking for.    You can create search agents on Monster, Indeed.com, Oodle.com and other sites. Search for "web" or "web developer" in your area to see what's out there.    Here's the most important thing: the web is growing by leaps and bounds, it just hit one billion users. We're not going back to the typewriter, the web is going to be more and more central to business. Get good web / tech skills and you'll be in a great position to get a job.    Best, Jo|`|atGPZz1Daa	Web development is a very broad topic, encompassing all previous technologies by utilizing a single presentation layer - the web browser.  It also has several off-shoots, User Interface (UI) design, graphic arts, information security, middleware architectures, etc.  The pay can be very lucrative to just OK, depending on what you are looking to do.    For example, a full-blown eCommerce site with ties to backend Customer Resource Management (CRM) application, accounting, inventory, and shipping apps could easily net the chief architect/designer in the mid $100k range.  On the other hand, someone doing simple one-pagers (ala MySpace or FaceBook) would probably be lucky to pull in $20-$25/hr.

AA10464818	YES -- you can charge the money you sent to your credit card    Note though that the fees are typically higher as compared when you are getting the funds from a checking or savings account.     So do read the fees carefully -- because you'll be paying interest rates on the use of the credit card plus higher wire transfer fees

b1be56f41a1af65af89a7fabde24526aaa	I started on my own. And if family didn't support then guess what? I'll still do it because I know why I am doing it, and I don't need a pat on back for family to tell me I can do it.    Support is great when you can get it but if you can't, then mate, it's about..    Your desire. What's your reason why? Is it burning enough. This should be the case anyway, whether with or without support because it's your dream.    When this is sorted, it doesn't matter if someone supports you or not, or if the world is against it.     It's about you are your dream, your desire, your belief in yourself, you believe in it so much, you're going to do it anyway and you can too. You can achieve if you're willing to raise your mindset.    So yes, I started my business without help from anyone, or family, or friends. And it wouldn't have mattered because I'm not doing it for pleasing people or for them to accept me, or acknowledgement.    I did it because it's my dream. It's a burning desire, I see it everyday, I get up no matter what and that's what's going to get you to succeed.    Final thought....are your friends, family successful in what you want to do? Then they won't be much help except moral, or tell you it won't work.    Find people who are successful in what you want to do, associate with them, read what they read and get mentored.    I don't ask my family for business advice or friends. They're broke. So what the heck are they going to advise me on when they can't help themselves?    So, be careful where your advice is coming from.    I don't believe in the stupid rule of "no friends," either. That is a backward and traditional, 90's approach to business. Those days are over.    You need friends but you might not find them with those you have but rather in a new enviroment, of network marketing association, or people who are doing what you are doing and succeeding. And their willing to give time to share knowledge.    Like a mastermind group. All successful people had a mastermind group of successful friends to bounce ideas, to share solutions and recieve ongoing encouragement EVEN when they were competitors.    Why? Because the right mind, and successful mind knows, there is more than enough for everyone but the backward mind thinks everyone is their competitin and there's not enough.    This is against the laws of success.    You can do it mate! And if you need encouragement. I and many friends are there to help. Go for it!|`|f3TcMOChaa	two heads are better than one. Ask for help from friends and family they won't charge you and may know things that you don't. Absolutely ask for financial support if they are willing to lend the money. Asians and Jew's are well known for keeping close ffamilyties, much to other peoples envy. If you do get the help and support of your family and friend's you will definitely succeed. To answer the question I had no help from my familly and it was tough - I would have been much better off if I would have had it though!|`|Uo2qhkCuaa	No way I could have started out without the moral support of my wife and kids - and I couldn't have grown it without my wife's active involvement in the business. A successful business is a team game. The pressure is too great to be able to do it on your own.|`|ac64ac6fee1a2695141b76329c3ebc22aa	The golden rule in business- No friends-     This may sound harsh - but it's a proven and well tested  edict-  Business is business- You have ideas, methods and perceptions that need to be played out - You don't need to argue with members of family who have differing   ideals -  You open your business and direct the operation. You finish business sand go home to your family. Don't assume nor  make the classic mistake of thinking that by saving a wage no consequences will become apparent- Many a relationships have been strained or  ended via  business associations-    It might work, but for it to do so , your partner has to give, be passionate  and understand as much as you do about the business  you are applying- Tell me so you are business today , and your wife says - i am tired I'll come in a few hours later!-You can't treat her the same you would an employee- get my point!    You enter into business for one reason only- To make Money. Sure many will tell you a whole lot of other things - bottom  line - to make money. You are indeed testing Your ideas and putting to practice what you perceive needs to  be done-You do so based on past experience and personal skill-If the business fails , you simply blame yourself , without blaming others- if it fails because family involvement , then you are going to place pressure of your relationship  that otherwise may have not existed- if you employ outsiders.    Getting family to help set up the business is different - once established - you should apply to run the business and direct the business on your own- You take control, you have control, one boss runs he business via direction given to paid others- the failure of such is yours alone  , as are the rewards-    The much used buzz word of th century - "Team Player"  is a nonsense application in reality -  You have to lead- you need a leader to run a business-It's always a team Leader that uses the term "Team Player"  to often include all other except himself- You lead, and you direct without being intimidated - You do so with supreme confidence- You can't fully apply such a doctrine if family is involved.
qWaYbxcxaa	The GM bolt plant has been idle since Nov as GM does not have sufficient capital to get that running.

In many areas, there might be volunteers to help you getting back & forth to chemo, but 96 miles sure is a stretch.  I suggest you call the closest branch of the American Cancer Society to see if they can help you.  I'm not so sure they would let you drive back and forth to the place anyways.  I got some procedures done at a hospital and they either kept an IV in me until my ride arrived or they followed me to the curb and waited with me.  I wasn't even allowed to go with a taxi.

Smaller banks especially and credit unions definitely offer secured loans.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	New loans and credit card purchases within 90 days of a bankruptcy are often disallowed.  For many people the financial downfall sneaks up on them and they have legitimate reasons for the transactions to be considered, but it's people who do what you want to do that ruin it for everyone.  That is, trying to grab as much money as you can before you turn around and declare bankruptcy.|`|WgT5l14baa	When you take out a loan, the assumption is that you intend to pay it back.  Taking out a loan just before filing for bankruptcy implies that you were not dealing in good faith and never intended to pay it back.  The judge could exclude debts that were "piled on" in this way, and you may have committed bankruptcy fraud.
qGfAlDd2aa	In my experience, that's the way it works.  The cycle is 30 days so, yes, the due dates move around.  Yes, late is considered late.  That's why I canceled a Mobil Oil account years ago.

To be honest,  i think everyone is when looking on the internet.  it does require time and effort and like i said i do it only Part time and i have generated enough for me to support my family and care for my girls.

I live in london, and polish have many many many many jobs down here. YOure the REASON YOU Dont have a job, its nothing to do with you eing polish. If youre good 4 the job youre good 4 the job.    Thanks for your pity party.  ( i doubt you are even polish)|`|HmiFGACXaa	I believe your english may be the problem. In this question there are many spelling and grammer errors. I do not hold that against you and you will learn the longer you are here.    I think you would better in completing a written application if you have all the information ahead of time and have someone help you with the spelling, etc. That way when you complete the application, you can copy off an information sheet with the correct spelling.    Assuming you have an accent and speak as you write, you would be better off not calling on the phone. The job market is tough and there are many people applying for the jobs. Even with perfect english, you may need to apply to a lot of jobs before being hired.    This country is not racist, heck we just elected a black President. If it is difficult to understand you, some people may take the easy road and just pass on hiring you. I am sure there are classes in your area to learn english. Work harder at it at it will help.    Welcome to America, I hope you succeed.

UT5HS39Daa	I am a registered nurse at a hospital in Greater Atlanta.  I am not sure of all of the openings, but I do know that there are at least 20 or so administration-type jobs available right now.  With your qualifications I am sure you could definitely get a job in hospital administration, considering most of them only require a high school education.  Depending on where you're located, you may have to make a commute to a larger hospital if there are not many openings at a community hospital, but who knows, there are usually always openings in administration.   Good Luck!! :)
N7G26k4Iaa	Simple.  Use www.AnnualCreditReport.com and you can get your credit report form each of the major reporting companies free once a year.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	When you get your free reports from annualcreditreport.com  PRINT them out.  1 in 5 people have an error in their reports.  If you can not access your reports it could be a couple of things.  1. You have not established any credit - thus not report  2. Your address may not match what they have on file.   Sometimes even the number 0 typed as an o can cause headaches.  Never delete your oldest account.   If you must pay for one of the bureaus score - I like Experian the best, but I suggest cleaning up your reports first - then getting the score if you plan to buy a home or a car.  /

Obviously the most popular way is through advertising. You can promote a product that relates to the topic of your blog.    When someone purchases the product through your link you get some of the money. So say you have a blog about losing weight. You would promote a website that sells weight loss pills. When someone buys a supply of weight loss pills for something like $27 you will get a percentage of that, which will be something like $15.     So everytime someone buys some weight loss pills you get money. The more people that visit your site, the more people will buy the product and the more money you will make.    You can also earn money with Google Adsense. You get paid everytime someone clicks on your ad. You cna get anywhere from $.02 per click to $15 per click. It all depends on the topic of your blog.    These are just a couple of the ways you can make money with blogging.

EXJfoGtAaa	First, you need to get your home on the market.  I strongly suggest you use a Realtor.  They are more than worth what you pay in commission.  The same Realtor can help you find a home.  But if you find one before your home is sold, I doubt the seller would accept an offer "subject to your home selling."  You would be better of to either ask for a long closing on the sale of your home (60 to 90 days) or plan on a short term rental.  You don't want to be rushed into buying a home so the rental is probably the best option.    realtor.sailor|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	You can put your house up for sale at any time.  It doesn't have to be empty to be on the market.  You should at least paint and clean very good, make any repairs and put away most of your personal belongings.

Micorsoft Money has a check register, but also has an excellent budgetting tool.  It shows you pie charts and graphs of where your money is going.  Every month I look at that pie chart and make sure I meet my savings goal.  I could not live without it.  /|`|AA11185479	Microsoft Money or Quicken are both terrific program for managing your personal finances.  You can also check your local library for books on "personal finance" that give sample budgets.    Each person has different needs and commitments, so each person's budget will look different.  -Simply divide it into two major categories - INCOME and EXPENSE.  -Then divide the Expense categories into two subcategories - MUST and OPTIONAL.  -Under each subcategory, list each of your expenses.  MUSTS usually include rent/mortgage, groceries, insurance (medical, housing, dental, vision, life, disability, etc), medical, transportation, child support, savings, taxes, and utilities.  OPTIONAL usually includes the fun stuff, the stuff you don't absolutely need - entertainment, dining out, gifts, charity, hobbies, household, music, coffee, etc.    -Check your records and estimate how much you spend in each category per month and per year.  -Then look at how much you earn per month and per year, and see where you need to adjust your spending to fit your income.    -Keep a copy of this budget with you at all times so you can refer to it before you spend money on anything.  -Set aside one day every week to look over your budget, track your spending, and pay your bills.  ("Money Monday" or "Financial Friday", whatever.)  Once you get in the habit and get on top of things, then you can switch to twice a month.

SJ37fYdjaa	In this case, you would really need to make a list of the pros and cons of this opportunity. Obviously another 19k on top of what you earn is awesome, that would be a pro point to make, and having no time off at all would be a con. But ask yourself this:    Do you really need the money? Do you really need to take on this job? Is it a safe bet to go into this job e.g. you wont be fired or made redundent.    If you do need the money, then go for it, take the "not having any vacation time for a year" on the nose. You will always have your days off.      As for knowing what the jobs like, why not look at it as a new learning experience, I mean, you are not learning anything new in your current job, and for it being too easy and confortable, thats just lazy. Get a job like the one offered, you feel more satisfied at the end of the day, as if you have done a days work.

2N6oTOLQaa	The way I see it, 3% is pretty much a cost of living raise that compensates you for inflation. In this economy it is plenty fair and a $129k salary is nothing to complain about even with your credentials.

A few law schools allow people to enter law school who haven't yet graduated.  Law schools have a lot of people apply so undergraduate grades do count.  You must also take a test called the LSAT to get into law school.  Law school is for three years.  After you graduate, you must take an examination called the bar exam.  Many states require you to take a separate exam on legal ethics.  Only after you pass the bar exam are you a lawyer.  You will likely have to continue taking a couple of days of legal training every year after that.    Primary teachers must complete a four year college degree in education, usually one specifically aimed at primary grades.  Different states have somewhat different requirements, and you may have to take an exam to get your license.  You will also have to teach under a teacher before you graduate.  Many states require you to continue to study to get a master's degree but will let you work and give you several years to complete that degree.|`|01WTU3gVaa	A liar.|`|sB27kehMaa	You have to go to law school to become a lawyer.

For the teacher, many school systems are now requyiring a Master's degree in education, which is another 2-3 years of schooling.    For a lawyer, you first need the 4-year undergrad degree (think business, economics, political science or pre-law) and then a degree from a law school.  In order to practice law, you then have to pass the Bar, which is a test of your knowledge of the law.|`|1SUew4gRaa	I am currently working a being a lawyer.  It is hard, long, but worth while.

b8ac9d386cb085d49199bccfce3255b1aa	My mother has done that in the past. Yes, if you just want the 20% off and you make sure there is no activation fee and then you cancel it and never put money onto it, it is probably a safe idea. However, most store credit cards charge ridiculous interest, in fact my boyfriend is struggling over a THIRTY percent interest rate on his Best Buy Reward Zone card. Just be careful and try not to put purchases on those store credit lines! :)|`|Kwywmcs8aa	That is terrible.

I don't do it any more -- but I still have the Bloomingdale's tote that I got from them!|`|dibW2uNzaa	No-     Your credit score is based on both your history of payment AND your rotating cards. Meaning that, the longer you have a card open, with a good payment history, and room left between what you owe and your max. balance, the better your score.  So, having 10 different cards that were only open for a year brings down your credit score.  And store cards do nothing for your score at all.  I would focus on having 1 or 2 major cards, with plenty of wiggle room.  Another piece of bad advice is to only charge a little every month and then pay off balances entirely- also not good.
63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	You have 3 years from due date to file.  If you owe there would be penalties, otherwise you will get your refund.  Up until April 15 2010.

If you are due a tax refund you will receive the full amount.  Don't forget to include the telephone tax excise (i believe its line 71 on Form 1040) to get the credit.  If you are filing the return on your own you can download form 1040 from the IRS website www.irs.gov click on more forms and publications, then prior years, you will also be able to view the instruction booklet with out having to print it out.  Good luck.|`|DGFu03Q3aa	Dear mom:  You are OK.  You can file for a refund for 3 years after the return was due. The return must be mailed to the IRS, no efile.    You say deployed, if that was military there are some benefits and special state benefits for you. Check with a tax professional.     You will still get your refund although it will be delayed a bit because you will have to mail it.
A1kiUMgvaa	I review numerous returns a day that have been filed and I have not seen a single deposit by the IRS.  The only people that have gotten any money are those with loans against their refunds.  The IRS normally only releases money on Wednesday and it takes another day or so for it to get through what ever bank is handling your refund.
4Jy8Hioiaa	YES, YES, YES. Keep putting it in. The stock market is on sale right now. Every time you put money in right now, you are buying shares of your mutual funds at a lower price. That means you are getting more shares every time you contribute. If you put $100 a week in (just an example) and the shares cost $25, you would only get 4 shares every week. If you put in $100 every week and the shares are down to $10, you are now buying 10 shares a week. Each share cost less right now than it did in the past. Once the share price goes back up in the future, you will have more shares making money for you. This is called Dollar Cost Averaging. Keep buying now, In the long run you will be much better off.|`|7IVEMAg8aa	Yes, especially if your company is doing any matching.|`|XZG35fxSaa	Yes, but it depends on how your 401k is invested.|`|CW7Sej2uaa	Buy low, sell high.

Contribute the most to get the match.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Yes. Investments are on sale right now. If you buy today and the economy just recovers to where it was at 2-3 years ago, you will have already doubled your money.<br>  <br>  EDIT: with your company matching at 6% this becomes a no brainer. the first 6% is not only getting invested tax free, but it doubles the moment it goes into the account. Then, if the economy just recovers to where it was a few years ago, you're money will double again, meaning it will have gone up to 4 times what you put in. Plus, since its a pre-tax investment, you are taking dollars that otherwise would have gone toward taxes and growing those dollars in your name instead of giving them to the IRS.
BXwv4dBvaa	Capital One is a branded card issuer for both Visa and MasterCard.  They have a comparison page on their website for all products they offer with the perks and service charges, etc.  Hopefully that can help you make a more informed decision.    I don't know of any reason someone would keep a Discover card in their wallet/purse, other than if you are looking to keep your credit charges under control.  Since it's rare to find a place that will take a Discover card, I guess you can keep a handle on your spending -- That's honestly all I can come up with for Discover.|`|sMTVcfiVaa	I love my Discover card. I recommend it 100%. Capital One sends too much pressuring mail, so I don't respond.    But Discover gives great cash back rewards for everything. Every few months, they rotate the 5% cashback items. Often, they're things like groceries, movies, restaurants, gas, hotels, etc. You get 5% back, no questions, no hassle. You can get it paid towards your bill, a check sent to you, deposited in your bank account, or you can change it into a gift card, and they usually double or triple it if you do that.     Aside from cashback rewards, you can do e-statements and their online stuff is really easy. You get email reminders for your bill, so you hardly ever forget to do it. You can also change your card (color, picture, etc) any time and they send it right away. If you pay your bills ontime, too, you'll get increased credit, and they do this really often. In 1 year, I got 1,750 more in credit.     They aren't pushy on the phone, either, which I find a HUGE plus.     Downsides: no frequent flyer miles or other rewards (that I know of) and not all places accept it. About 80% of places accept Discover. My best suggestion for you? Get both cards, but use your Discover card when you can.      EDIT: They also have 1% cashback on all purchases if it's not in the 5% cashback category. So you always get free money!!|`|WJjfrf0Caa	why don't you start with basic reasons. see what each company will offer you in terms of:    interest rate  finance charges  late fees  credit limit  annual fee    If those are exactly the same, then you have to look at where you will use a credit card. some places do not accept Discover. When you use your credit card at a gas station, the gas station has to pay a certain fee to either Visa or Mastercard or Discover. That's how the credit card company makes money. But Discover has the highest fee that they charge businesses. This works for you because they are then able to give you 1% of your money back. But just make sure that you check out where you usually shop (grocery, online bill paying). Make sure that they accept Discover.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Well do the stores that you go to accept discover?  That's what you should find out before you get a discover card since they aren't widely accepted.  I would go with Capital One.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	They all have different programs, it depends on which you favor.  If you are going to carry a balance, the interest rate should be the most important.  Do not just look at the "teaser"rate, look at the long term rate.  If you would like to travel, a rewards card with air miles is good.  But if you do not plan to travel those miles will go to waste.  I prefer the cash reward card because I always pay my bill in full each month so it becomes a discount on each purchase. Many cards are affinity cards like for your favorite gas company or many charities. Some will donate the reward to your favorite charity.  If you have no favorite I suggest you start with your bank, with your card and cash in one place if there is a problem they are more likely to straighten it out without a lot of excessive charges than just any card.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	Neither, get your credit at a credit union.  A lower interest rate is better than reward points or other gimicks.  Situations change and with the economy the way it is you might only can afford payments.  Unemployment can happen.  My credit union's interest rate on visa account is 7.9%.  I have a lower rate than that as I have been with them for a long time.  They also have never raised rates.
U0vr7T6laa	Arnold   Swartzenneger  ( formerly known as the Terminator) signed the California budget.  Your dad should be getting his refund soon.  Check the California website and put in the proper info to determine the status of his refund.  They usually ask a few questions,    SS#, filing status and exact amount of the refund (rounded to the nearest dollar). Credit score has nothing to do with it.
0yqQg9CXaa	There is one thing your bf can do quickly to boost his credit scores.  If he is carrying any credit card debt, he needs to pay it in full right away.    The amount of debt you carry, will directly reduce the amount you will qualify for in monthly payments.  You can get a home under your name only since you are not married.  Try applying at different banks, one joint and one just you.  Make all your applications in a 3 week window so they will be counted as one inquiry.  If you can try to put 20% down on a home so you don't pay that nasty PMI.  PMI is not tax deductible, and does not apply towards principal or interest.  It's like throwing money away.    Please do a 15 or 30 year fixed.  Banks are still pushing variable rates.  Everyone knows interest rates will go up again.  With a variable rate your monthly interest payment can more than double.  Banks make huge profits off variable rates - don't let them bully you.  /|`|CW7Sej2uaa	757 is high enough to qualify.  Most lenders will lend an amount that results in your total debt payments being less than 35% of your gross income.  So add up all your credit card, car, electronic store payments, etc.  Subtract that from 35% of your gross and that is the maximum payment you can have for your mortgage.  You can find a payment calculator that will tell what the loan amount is that will fit that payment.    Kepp in mind that that is the maximum, but it is often difficult to make ends meet if go to 35%.  You have to look at your budget to see what you can afford.  The payment the lender quotes you will probably not include taxes, insurance, or mortgage insurance.  So plan for those as well.  Also, PMI is tax deductible now but still put  down 20% if you can so you can get a lower rate.|`|35l5cn2Haa	Mortgage loan is a term used for the loans secured by a property.

9oMXpS05aa	yes, as long as you have available credit on your card, you may use it.  using a credit card is a good way to start establishing credit, however if you have maxed out the credit line on all your credit cards, that will hurt your credit score. you want to use less than 70% of your credit limit at any given time.  also i would suggest paying more than the minimum balance due, otherwise it'll take damn near forever to pay it off. also, paying more than the minimum balance will help your credit score.|`|qBCGH52haa	You can only use the card up to your credit limit.  If you were $94 from your limit and paid $86, you now have available credit of $180.

Put your tax return into a savings account as an emergency fund.  If you foresee that your job may be at risk, it's wise to have an extra pool of funds to rely on if you income is reduced or eliminated.    Think about it: you take a trip and have a great time.  Once you get back, if you lose your job, you may go further into debt to cover living expenses.  This only adds YEARS until your debt free.      You sound young, so I would have to say, concentrate on getting out of debt first, and once you;re debt free you will have lots of time to travel in the future.  As well as be able to afford it!|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Here's the thing...you may need to escape a little once in a while, but it's a temporary fix, and you'll come back to the same situation once your vacation's over...minus 1,000 dollars in your bank account.  What you're considering is called "robbing Peter to pay Paul".  You're using money that you may have to fall back on in the future to make you feel a little better (temporarily) NOW.      Like another answerer said, you should take several 'mini trips'...a long weekend here and there.  It'll give you the rest and relaxation you need, and it won't empty your piggy bank.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I would definately hold off in this economy. Protecting your credit rating and paying off all the expenses are much more important.Many people never even achieve an amount of saved money to vacation because things like unexpected car needs, unexpected prolonged illness or injury keeps them from working and recieving full pay checks. Hours can get cut and as you mentioned your job can go away overnight. Being self sufficient with no other cares and concerns is a great feeling. Keep yourself at that level. It can sometimes take months to get over and illness, or find a new job. One grand is a small nest egg, keep it safe and sound. Build a vacation fund now that you have some backup for emergencies in life.  I have lost jobs.  Missed work from surgeries that were very unexpected.  Had my car totalled out and had to go buy a new one with the bad settlement amount. This is extremely common.   Family emergency that you need the funds to go somewhere.  Notice to move that you were not expecting.   Good job on that saving though, itd be funner to go blow it, but seriously, part of being on our own, is keeping ourselves covered.

MY neighbor is sharp as a tack in building and i thought he  had a bldg permit for his carport ROOF.  HE had to tear it down!    it was perfect but not done THEIR way.|`|Vgj5CsKTaa	This depends completely on what you BOTH want. From experience, I would also build. We are in the process of selling our second home in 3 years. The first home was nice, Second home was bigger & nicer.  The problem we are running into is our home is NOT the way we want it. We had built rooms on to the first house, & completely remodeled our second. Most of the work we have done on our own & regret how much time we have missed on the simple things in life. Now, if things go our way very soon, we will be ridding ourselves of this property we have worked so hard on & dumped tons of money into. We are wanting to build, & right now...good time! Good Luck!|`|yhjoTuHzaa	Building is typically cheaper than buying. It is in no way as easy. There are permits to obtain, inspections to go through and you will have to contract out for sewer and water not to mention electricity.     Personally I am not a do it yourselfer, but if your fiance can pull it off, you can do it once and have what you want.     The market value will be better - God willing - in the coming years, so either way this is the time to move.

Most people will be losing money in your class. I prefer defensive than running out and buying.|`|ww12lItvaa	The basic idea during a recession is buy companies that make things people are not willing to do without.      So they say to buy companies that make things you can eat, drink, smoke, or related to health. And health also includes cosmetics. That is one reason that JNJ is holding up so well, both the stock and the earnings.     Colgate recently had a good earnings report. They are even selling toothpaste well in emerging markets where it is considered more of a luxury item. They were joking on CNBC yesterday how they were happy people were still brushing their teeth in these bad times.     In the past booze sales went up when the economy went down. I assume it is "cheap" entertainment. But alcohol sales have fallen some this time. I think maybe this recession is bad enough it has been rather "sobering". LOL  But booze might bounce back first based on past history assuming it does well when things are down.       Good Luck

90e77b34338856a778a43fc695156a06aa	Unlike what others have said here, Cell Phone companies do report to  credit agencies...but only for non-payment, not for payments made on time. The credit report will only show any payments that are paid after 30 days late.  Credit reports don't show payments that are reported up to 29 days late, just 30, 60, 90 days.  So, if your bill is due on the 5th, and you pay it on the 14th, nothing will show, but it may effect your future credit only with that individual company. For instance, if you want to open another account with T-Mobile at some later time, they may require a deposit, or even refuse you a credit line.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	It will not affect your score whatsoever.  The only thing that will show up on a report is an inquiry.  Only if you fail to pay - will it show up on your report.

Once it goes to collections, is when it shows up.  /|`|7QPv7ta7aa	Cell phones, like rent and utilities, don't report to the credit bureaus.  If you default on the account and it is sold off to a collection agency, the collection agency will report the debt to the credit bureaus.

It will affect your wallet though, because you will be charged late payment fees on the entire amount that you pay late.

STYhiMEyaa	The cheapest way to promote your business isn't always the best.  Fliers can be very cheap to produce but the results of them can be pretty haphazard.    In your line of business, word of mouth is by far the best way of promotion and it also happens to be reasonably inexpensive, even if you offer incentives to people to recommend you.    Another good way is to get some press coverage.  Do you have an unusual story about how you became a beauty therapist or do you offer a revolutionary new treatment?  These are the things that local papers like as news items.  They won't do a straight plug for your business - that's what paid advertising is for - but if it's something that's of interest to their readers, you'll stand a good chance of having it published.  Maybe you could offer to do a free treatment for a journalist of one of your special therapies.  They'll usually give you a write up because they tell the story from their perspective.

sI3krJULaa	If you start an LLC, you don't worry about payroll or dividends.  Essentially, you and your partner decide what percent of the company each of you own.  Then all income and expenses will be divided among you (so, essentially, net income will be divided between you.)  This will be reported on a K-1 once the LLC's tax return is complete.  That K-1 shows your share of the net income, which you then report on your Schedule E.<br>  <br>  It flows through to your personal return- the LLC itself doesn't pay income taxes- you pay the income taxes on the income directly.<br>  <br>  You can organize the LLC so it's taxed like a C-Corp, but most people don't- it defeats one of the major benefits of organizing as an LLC- no double-taxation.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)

qWaYbxcxaa	It would be incorrect to make the argument that "gold has been good investment for the long hall."<br>  <br>  According to Chase Global Digest, Gold is the 2nd worst investment in history after diamonds. <br>  <br>  It took gold nearly 25 some odd years to go from it's previous high to next high again. So basically it took 25 years to break even in gold (not even factoring inflation) if one bought it at it's early 1980's high.<br>  <br>  This assumes gold was purchased using U.S. Dollars. <br>  <br>  30 year gold chart<br>  <a href="http://goldprice.org/30-year-gold-price-history.html" rel="nofollow">http://goldprice.org/30-year-gold-price-...</a><br>  <br>  I was trading gold for a while, and exited the position on or about 02-20-2009 when Gold broke over $1000/ oz. (again) and been out of it since. <br>  <br>  If you have never traded futures before I would not be jumping into that. I have been in this biz for 20 years and still would not be trading futures. It is a very complex investment, and is highly risky. I leave this to the professional futures traders to figure out.<br>  <br>  I may look at it only if the economy show signs that it is going to plunge further near term, banks are semi-nationalized, or another shoe drops in the market. <br>  <br>  Most popular gold trading is the indexes:<br>  <br>  GLD = 1x long gold<br>  DGP = 2x long gold<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  If I was to look at an alternative it would depend on one's age, risk tolerance, time frame, and overall financial goals and financial picture.<br>  <br>  If one has debt such as CC debt, I would pay that first. <br>  <br>  Long term I have been repeatedly posting this as a basic strategy:<br>  S&P 500 Index<br>  in a Roth IRA<br>  Dollar Cost Average bi-monthly<br>  Do this for 15-20 years+<br>  <br>  edit/follow up comment - reality check: ------------------------------<br>  "Net adviser fails to mention gold adjusted for US dollar inflation is at $3500 per ounce."<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how long the other poster has been a broker and a what kind of broker, but that would not be a correct statement. <br>  <br>  If one factored inflation on an investment one would SUBTRACT inflation from the return of the investment. <br>  <br>  Example: <br>  If inflation was 3% in one year, and you made 6% on your money, your inflation adjusted return would be 3% (6% return less 3% inflation = 3% inflation adjusted return).<br>  <br>  This is why bank CD's, and money markets tend to be poor investment choices over the long term.  They almost always pay less than the inflation rate, thus over time, one loses their buying power. Most people get it that things cost more over time. This is inflation. We don't get free extra money just because there is inflation. Your mutual fund company does not send you an extra check each year based on the inflation rate. The stock your holding does not send you a check because inflation went up. Your car manufacture doesn’t send you a check if the value of your car drops because of inflation. Most jobs don’t have a pay increase each year to keep up with inflation either. <br>  <br>  Unless one has something like TIPS - "Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities," for example, one will not get paid more money on their investment because of inflation.<br>  <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tips_glance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/prod...</a><br>  <br>  I ran historic inflation models when I worked at a top Wall Street firm for clients to show what inflation does to money over time - it eats it away (things costs more). <br>  <br>  Based on historical inflation models, generally over 30 years $1.00 cash will have a buying power of 30 cents. Thus investment in Gold on or about 1980, at $1,000.00 an oz, the inflation adjusted return would be roughly $300.00. This is because gold did not keep up with the net increase of inflation. That is why Chase Global Digest research has said it is the 2nd worst investment after diamonds.<br>  <br>  To say that gold is worth by any calculation $3,500 or whatever, is absurd. Tell ya what. I'll buy gold in the open market at today's price of about $950.00 an oz, and you tell me you are dying to buy it from me at $2,000.00 oz. right now. If you think your answer is correct, then you'll make $1,500 oz.

You sound like an overall beginner in the commodity markets. I would not recommend futures for you because they are very risky. I would suggest getting a book on commodity investing because it is very different from stock investing. There are certain styles of investing and a whole new vocabulary. I would say try any kind of consumer staple stock. They benefit from this downturn. Their advertising and transportation of goods is much cheaper now. So basically their expenses are lowered.|`|stEFmt1qaa	Forget futures.  And forget investing in the market right now.  Rates are low, and the DOW's under 8000.  Buy gold it worth more than 1000 an ounce and is constantly going up.  Buy actual certified bars, you can get them in gram and ounce demonitations.  They come stamped w/ weight and purity, you can buy them from many companies.  Get a safety deposit box(50bucks/year) and start filling.  Ohh also try looking at investing in platinum and pallidium.  Pallidium is the up and coming platinum, right now its cheaper than gold and it is stronger and more durible than platinum, jewelers are beginning to use pallidium as well.  Check it out.|`|yVeCvK5Baa	Do remember that gold is still near an all-time high, and that it is an extremely volatile investment.  That said, the easiest way for most lay individuals to invest in gold is through an ETF that actually holds the metal.  One such is GLD, which you can buy through any brokerage account, and holds nothing but the metal itself.  Effectively you're buying a portion of the gold stored in their vaults.  If you'd rather play the gold mining companies, look at an ETF like GDX, which owns the stocks of many gold mining companies.  Good luck.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	I think there's room for both in a portfolio.  <br>  <br>  Essentially, buy stocks if you think the economy will eventually recover.  <br>  <br>  Buy gold if you think that either: government efforts to stimulate the economy will fail, and global investors will lose faith in the strength of the US, or the stimulus, whether it works or not, will create an inflationary environment in the future.<br>  <br>  Hedge your bet by buying some of both, but don't forget about bonds- they are a very important part of any portfolio.|`|He5XWnJtaa	Gold and commodities in general are a great investment in this climate because they have inherent value that is unimpeded by the insolvency of paper investments and equities. When the economy starts to recover, it is inevitable that the huge amount of liquidity that's been pumped into the system will result in large amounts of inflation, and commodities are the place to be to hedge against those losses.|`|2CwUFqx1aa	For around 1500 dollars you can open a commodity account and buy futures of gold.  When the market goes up you buy futures at a higher level than the market.  If the market keeps going up your futures increase in value and you can sell at any time and take a profit. Let's say gold is at $800  per ounce and you buy futures for $1000 per ounce.  That is far out of the market and they would be cheap. About $100 ea. You are betting that gold will continue to rise.  If it continues you can double or triple your money.  If it falls you LOSE.  Precious metals are risky business and you should seek competent advise.
AbRfd29Haa	Right now... locally, the USA has been buying, so have others. Brazil, the world leader in fuel alcohol, has been exporting to the USA (and others). <br>  <br>  In 2006, the USA imported 47% of Brazil's exports, followed by Holland (11%), Japan (7%), Sweden (6%), Jamaica (6%), and El Salvador (5%). <br>  <br>  Last summer, we imported (from Brazil) 786,000 barrels in June, 675,000 barrels in July, and 804,000 barrels in August. The primary reason was for jet fuel, and this was more than usual, due to a waver of some duties, which has since been restored. Prior to this, imports from Brazil were small. <br>  <br>  Many of the Caribbean and Central American countries are ethanol exporters: Jamaica, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, and El Salvador. That's due to sugar cane production... modern processes get about a 6:1 return on energy from ethanol production based on cane sugar.. that's comparable to many of the oil sources today. Corn ethanol, in contrast to many rumors, does actually produce net energy, but it's on the order of 1.6-1.8:1, similar to the production of oil from oil shale in Canada (Canada is also a small ethanol exporter). <br>  <br>  US use of fuel ethanol was jump-started by changes in the laws for "winter fuels". In much of the country, there's a mandate for different fuel formulations during the winter months, to help ensure more complete burning and less pollution. The original additive was a compound called MTBF, which is (surprise!) made by the petroleum industry. This had been mandated, but after it proved to be a nasty pollutant, they banned MTBF and allowed ethanol to be used instead. There's a secondary demand growing, given the push for non-Middle-Eastern energy sources and the growing availability of FlexFuel vehicles (for about $100 cost, a car can be designed to run on fuels varying from 100% petrol to 15% petrol and 85% ethanol). <br>  <br>  Imports from some of the equatorial countries are under a special duty-free deal.. they had shut down much of the Brazilian imports as a result. This is fairly cheap ethanol... chances are, companies will still be importing it even as they start to export excess... which is coming. The USA could be an ethanol exporter this year, and will certainly be moving in that direction. <br>  <br>  China has done both, imports and exports. Worldwide, you would need some serious research to find them all.

lthNfh8vaa	A great home based business is a Virtual Assistant business.  A Virtual Assistant is an independent entrepreneur who provides a variety of services, virtually, to businesses that are in need of administrative support.    Some of the services provided by a Virtual Assistant are word processing, data entry, email management, database management, web design, and much more.  If you have previous work experience in such services this may be the business for you.    If you are interested in this industry the first thing you should do is your research.  The best place I found that really helped me when I started my Virtual Assistant business is VAnetworking.  They offer a lot of services to VA's.  Many of the things that they offer include: eseminars, a forum to talk with other VA's, free membership, a startup system to help you get your business started, and much more.    The Virtual Assistant industry is great for many people, and it may be great for you too.  Keep one thing in mind when you decide on what home based business you want to pursue.  That is, when you invest in a Virtual Assistant business you are investing in your own business, yourself, and your future.  You do not have to worry about where your money goes.

The type of home business best suited to you all depends on many factors.    - Your available funds/costs  - Your available time to work on the business  - What your income goals are (Very important)  - Your level of seriousness (MOST IMPORTANT)  - What you actually want to do (Which area of interest)    i.e. Do you want to work for some one else (a J.O.B... yuk!)... or do you want to make money for your self! (Hooray!)    Once you have figured some of these out, then it is time to look around in the chosen areas. Get creative and take initiative. Talk to people, do research on the internet.

CW7Sej2uaa	Law school is a lot of work.  Starting pay for attorneys is 70k to 90k depending on where you live, but typically jr attorneys work 80 to 100 hours/week.  It is mostly reading and research and writing.  If you enjoy long hours and sitting at a desk, making decent money then it is worth it.      Maybe you should try and do some job shadowing or an internship before you commit to law school.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	4 years of college, THEN you have to pass the LMAT test AND get accepted by a law school, then 3 more years of school, then hope you graduate and pass the bar exam, and hope someone hires you so you can work 100 hrs a week for a bunch of years. There is already a severe excess of Lawyers in the USA and not all of them make a lot of money.    say you get hired at $80k and you have to work 80 hrs a week - 50 weeks a year for the first couple of years (or more) - that's only $20 an hour, probably one day off a week if you are lucky, no time for a social or family life|`|WYjbuu6saa	No, it is not worth it.    Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in.  Many reasons.  Main reason?....We simply have WAY TOO MANY Lawyers - we have a GLUT of Attorneys.    The law schools know this, but won't tell you - law students are easy money for them because they have to make very little investment - the law schools know the economy is SATURATED.      So this means:  Even IF you finish law school, you probably won't be able to find a job when you are done - plus you'll owe approx $150,000+ in debts.

Uc7GM2Rnaa	applying for a mortgage can be like a financial rectal exam.   You can't hide anything.<br>  Full documentation will mean w-2's, paystubs, tax returns.  If you are claiming bank accounts as assets, you might be asked to prove that those assets exist.<br>  If you are saying that you have $20,000 for a down payment, they will want to see a bank account with $20K in it and know how long it has been there, to make sure that they are not borrowed funds.<br>  If you say you have $150,000 in various banks ands and stocks and bonds...  yet your tax returns show no claims of interest and dividends..  they're going to want to know stuff.  Part of what you sign when you apply for a mortgage gives the right for the lender to request information from banks you put down as sources of assets and down payments.<br>  <br>  You can lie to your friends, to your spouse and to your parents.

The present value is a worthless figure to note when one has an annuity paying $60k a year (before taxes). Who cares what present value is when you have money coming in your mail?    The reality part is that taxes are not considered, and that if one wins the lotto they lose about 1/2 due to the cash pay out.

But, I think that hiring managers are aware of this, and are making allowances.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	They would not keep that information.

Until your loan has been modified your current loan with them is still active and if you continue to miss payments they WILL foreclose.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The lenders are changing their rules so quickly that no one knows what to do. They won't modify your mortgage unless you are 2 payments behind. But when you get 2 payments behind, you may not like the offer they give you. Then you are in trouble with your credit score. If you get 3 payments behind, they want the money. Even tho you are waiting for an answer on your modification.  I think you have to assume the worst. Assume that you will not like the modification. Act accordingly. Only you can decide to pay the money or not. It is your life that is in the balance..

You cannot do this in any way.  It is the responsibility of the insured to leave a paper trail or documentation of the life insurance policy so that his/her beneficiaries can locate it.    There are chain emails that go around that are complete scams (sometimes they get mailed in letter format, usually from overseas) that claim that you can recieve money from unclaimed life insurance or that you may be a beneficiary for some distant distant relative.  I cannot express enough how much of a scam this is.    You wanna know who has unclaimed life insurance money?  The life insurance companies....nobody else.
RZzMse3Haa	It depends on if you are on a month to month or a lease.    Lease: You can be penalized for leaving early.  Your lease should specifically state what you must pay.    Month to month:  You can leave with 30 days notice.
LOrFtSCHaa	You hit it on the nail. First and foremost you need to have a written plan (budget) in order to see where your hard earn money is supposed to go before you get paid, so when you get paid you pay those items first.  This will also help you make sound desicions when you want to spend on other things.      If you want to save money, unfortunately you need to sacrifice, live like no one else so later you can live like no one else.  Live on less than you make, cut off the services you do not need, cell phone, cable and so forth, do not eat out (this is where most of the money goes) cook everything from scratch.  do not purchase any frozen foods or specialty foods.  Anyway, you really need to live on rice and beans for a while until you get out of debt.  If you really want that car you will tighten your belt and you will have to tell your friends that unless they pay for you to go out you are staying home.|`|qWaYbxcxaa	You can also have your bank auto debit a fixed dollar from your checking account each month into a separate savings account or CD account.|`|grSkGQ8Faa	Put it into an ISA and give it to someone else to control.

Put only the silver money and bills in.. then break it when it's full.  That might help you not to spend it.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Well, i disagree, you need to save it in a credit union not in a bank they yield more for your money.  And make sure it is not an easy access account so you don't get itchy fingers and spend the money.     Personal finances is 80% behavior and 20% math.  You have to be discipline about this.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	IS there a reason you can't deposit money into a savings account?  The only difference between a savings account at the bank and your piggy bank is that you are more likely to break open the pig when you want some cash.      The savings account is a better option.  You can deposit money whenever you want and on top of that, the interest comes from the bank, rather than your pocket.    Have you considered one of those "round up" credit cards?  I think there's also a bank that offers a "round up" debit card.  Your purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the balance is moved to a savings account.  (Bank of America?)|`|FhSKRB7Kaa	I didn't understand your piggy bank technique but I think the money is better off at bank. You will at least get some interest. Just stop using your debit card and try using cash for a while eventhough it is a bit uncomfortable.     Paying someone with cash makes a huge difference than paying with debit card as you will see the "money" $$$$$$$$ going away.
0yqQg9CXaa	I thought I read somewhere that most homes over a million dollars are paid for in cash.    Most of the people that own them are wise about money, and know that paying interest on a jumbo loan is throwing away money.  Interest on Jumbo Loans are MUCH HIGHER than conventional loans.    Buy a smaller home, pay it off.  Then buy a bigger home, pay it off.  Eventually you can buy your million dollar home in cash.  /

If this is just a low income area, such as a lower maintained area vs others, then the landlord would of told you, you damaged the carpet and it costs x amount to replace it, and you then have a problem to deal with, pay or move and have a judgement possibly put against you.|`|pNy8lakjaa	No you are not responsible, since that is "wear and tear" on the apartment, and that is what you paid a deposit for.|`|IaaDgCgWaa	When I lived in a low income apartment, the renters were never responsible for buying new carpet. I suppose if you damaged it they might consider you liable but I wouldn't agree otherwise. If it's old and even if you DID damage it, I would not agree to pay the entire amount.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	This is something that will likely vary by state law. In California, I don't know about having the carpet replaced while you're occupying the apartment, but I don't believe you can be charged for new carpet when you move out if you've been in the apartment for more than 7 years.    I guess the question you haven't answered is if the carpet has been damaged or if it's just worn down. If it's the former, then you can be charged if the carpet is less than 7 years old(? exact  ). If it's the latter, then you shouldn't be charged at all.|`|AA10458195	No you are not responsible for the carpet. You pay rent to live there, but you don't have to replace things that don't belong to you. That is  the Landlord's responsibility.|`|jiXQ8eDFaa	That varies from renter to renter. Ask your landlord, or review your lease.|`|qQGjRpiZaa	I know here in texas they have to replace it every 2 years. Don't move to another complx just another apt and get new carpet. They are supposed to clean it for you if you stay.|`|wd5rksMoaa	Depending on where you live the landlord must replace all carpets and paint the walls after someone moves out.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	If you damaged it, yes. If it is normal wear and tear, no. Don't let them bully you around and remember they cannot punish you for appealing their decision, also remember that they are not the only low-income apartments in the world. But if you want to find another low-income apt. do it before they put it on your credit report.    What landlord said would be correct if you were not in a low-income apt., they inspect most of them monthly and will kick you out if you mess something up that way it does not get too far out of hand and the tenant cannot afford the damages.
dCbIHBpGaa	Depends on the size of the audit really and who you get to do it. An audit by a local small practice will be considerably cheaper than if you get one of the big four like KPMG to do it! The auditor is attaching a report to the accounts stating that they show a true and fair view and they can get in hot water if that statement proves not to be true. They will therefore perform tests and procedures they think necessary in order to be confident that the accounts are true and fair and this can take days to do. A lot of the cost depends on the client though. Two clients of roughly the same size can pay totally different fees depending on their accounting records eg a company with sage, that produces its own trial balance and monthly management accounts will probably pay less than one that just has invoices in boxes and expects the auditor to go from there.|`|fYUgURZmaa	A painter was once asked why his drawings were so expensive, since they took only minutes to be drawn.    The painter (Dali, I think) answered: minutes maybe, but a whole life of training.    Auditors are highly trained professionals and they are paid accordingly.    But remember that they usually work in a competitive market, it is quite often worth asking for offers regularly (every 2-3 years) and compare bids.|`|VzWMoO6eaa	to make sure everything was paid for and keep things fair financially of course|`|gTuoOpOKaa	An audit is an examination of the accounting statements prepared by the management of an organization. The auditor will examine these statements to ensure that whatever is stated in the financial statements present a true and fair view of the statement of affairs of the business.    The cost of audit differs from business to business as well as the quantum of work that needs to be done to certify the statements. Some medium and large businesses have their own internal audit staff and their work reasonably minimizes the work of external auditors in which case the audit costs will be lesser than that of a business which does not have internal audit function.    Audit fees are also different depending on the audit firm since they have a sizeable operating costs. Again in some countries their chargeable fee is regulated by the body of accountants they represent which require that the fee should not be less than that prescribed. In olden days there have been cases of under cutting in fees by the auditors.
HBK9aIhxaa	Brent Crude is the biggest of the many major classifications of oil consisting of Brent Crude, Brent Sweet Light Crude, Oseberg and Forties. Brent Crude is sourced from the North Sea. The Brent Crude oil marker is also known as Brent Blend, London Brent and Brent petroleum. It is used to price two thirds of the world's internationally traded crude oil supplies.    The other well-known classifications (also called references or benchmarks) are the OPEC Reference Basket, Dubai Crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI).    The name "Brent" comes from the naming policy of Shell UK Exploration and Production, operating on behalf of Exxon and Shell, which originally named all of its fields after birds (in this case the Brent Goose). It also refers to the formation layers[citation needed]Broom, Rannoch, Etive, Ness and Tarbert, which are named after geographical featureslochs and glensof the Scottish Highlands).|`|AA11570236	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude  this should help|`|qF1M8KQ5aa	i dont know but it sounds damageing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|q8nwHwNEaa	Shell UK Exploration (Shell Gas station) are the guys that name it "Brent."

8ttynrbfaa	The stimulus plan is to stimulate new sales... so I'm surprised it even backdates to Jan 1, 2009. Seeing as how the original bill was from April 9, 2008 to July 1, 2009, Congress has already proven they don't want to help anyone before the date a bill passes.    It is completely unfair to modify a bill for only part of it's date range. Congress is insulting every one of us that bought a house because of the original bill. They've been avoiding mentioning that, and instead tout the benefits of the modified plan on encouraging new sales.    The news states that not may people have taken advantage of the Tax Credit in it's current state, since it's a loan and not a credit... but seeing as how taxes are just now being filed, I believe these reports to be wrong. Simple searches online show a lot of people bought houses last year and are planing to use the credit... and none of them are happy about being shafted by this Congress.    What everyone should do, is contact their senators, and the White House, and tell them your opinion.

4MypYVHYaa	You will not be required to pay anything to your lender if the lender complete the foreclosure procedure using the non-judicial foreclosure procedure.     Under this procedure normally the lender has the right to sell the property after completing the foreclosure procedure. The lender, under this procedure can not normally sue for a judgment after the sale. You do not have the right to reclaim the house under any circumstance.    If you are not required to go to court and has not received documents from a court stating that you must appear. This is probably the procedure being used by your lender.    Most lenders use this procedure.    If the lender use the judicial foreclosure procedure they are allowed by law to file a judgment against you.     Most lenders, though the law allow them to file for a judgment do not do so. They would just rather sell the property, write any loss off and move on without other legal problems that might cost them money and then would have to collect on the judgment if they won.     On the other hand  the law also allow you the right to reclaim your house after the foreclosure procedure has been completed normally up to a year.     If you received a document stating that you have to appear in court and a date for you appearance has been set, your lender is probably using this procedure.    This method of foreclosure is used by a few lenders where both procedures are allowed.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck    "FIGHT ON"|`|23SkYEw5aa	YES!!!

After the foreclosure all of your debt, from the money you spent, may not be repaid.       You still need to pay it.   It was real money, not play money, you do not get to just keep it because you think that money should be given away for free.|`|qBCGH52haa	Possibly.  Depends on how hardball the lender wants to be.  By law, any difference between the auction/sale price for the house after foreclosure (plus fees) and the balance on the mortgage remains the borrower's responsibility.  If the lender is so inclined, he can attempt to collect the difference via normal collection procedures (court judgment/garnishment; collection agency, etc.).
txFLGStyaa	Yes, the poverty shown in the movie is exaggerated.... I think it is useful for the movie to show how far above his circumstances he climbed. Think, if he lived and grew up in a nice neighborhood as a child, he wouldn't have had to work through any of those things, and it would've been a bad movie, right?    I don't think that people will pay too much attention to that since it's only a movie, after all. Every country on the planet has poor areas, and India is no exception.

You should check it out, I have been taking paid surveys online for a little over a year now and I have been making $200.00-400.00 per month every month. This is the best site I have came across for paid surveys.|`|Dsgpsbndaa	if you find one that works ....<br>  add me and tell me where lol.|`|sauJ6VxSaa	There is. If you look around enough I'm sure you can find plenty. One of them is Survey Monster <a href="http://www.surveymonster.net/surveymonster.jsp?" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveymonster.net/surveymonst...</a> I haven't actually signed up to this one, but from what I've heard, and according to the site, it's completely FREE. <br>  <br>  If what you're looking for is just to make some extra income online, I wouldn't necessarily stick with surveys because there are many better, more efficient ways to make money out there. What I use is a program called ACME people search and I'm making up to an extra $1,500 a week. Granted you won't get rich but the system is completely automated once you get it going and you get paid for doing basically nothing.

8HeKhxndaa	You need to create a database for yourself of contacts.  To get in touch with the correct contact person at a company you should contact the person in charge of Purchasing or the Office Manager.  They are the one's that take care of managing vendors, office supplies and that sort of thing.  However, usually if you don't have a name you can't get through... So my advice is to sweet talk the front desk receptionist and be as polite as you can when asking for the purchasing manager or office manager.

Have had the right to file a joint return in the year of your spouse's death.<br>  <br>  3.

The only time you can take the qualifying widow status is if you have a dependent.  If you do, then you can still claim it (as long as you meet the other requirements (you haven't remarried, you could have filed jointly the year he died, and the dependent lives with you and you pay for more than half of the upkeep of that home)).  2008 would be your last year, though.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :0)|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	I believe that you could only claim that for 2006 and 2007.

Gun3UGzaaa	MICR = magnetic ink character recognition.  It is the numbers across the bottom of your check that indentify your bank and your specific checking account number.  The restaurant's bank uses that to create a computer file to get payment from your bank.<br>  <br>  What probably happened is their employee put the check in a scanner incorrectly.  So, when the file was attempted to be sent to your bank, it couldn't read the MICR codes, so the payment failed.<br>  <br>  So, the restaurant was wrong to send you a NSF letter.  The restaurant can take the check to the bank to be cashed, or they can try to resubmit it through their scanner.  Or, you could just go down to the restaurant and exchange the check for cash.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay any fees, though. The mistake is on his employee's end.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	not to worry -- it is his and his bank's problem -- should something arise just take the paperwork to your bank and have them help your straight in it out!!!
OHlSESqwaa	The first time home buyer credit as a 0% loan. The max credit is $7500 and can be taken by "first time home buyers" - those who have not owned a principal residence in the last 3 years. The purchase must be after 4/8/2008 and before 7/1/2009.  If the credit is on the 2008 return the pay back starts on the 2010 return and is $500 per year for 15 years.  There is no additional fee when you sell - in the year of sale you pay back the remaining loan amount on your tax return. But this amount  is limited to the gain on the sale - be sure to reduce your basis by the outstanding loan amount to figure gain for this purpose.

When you leave the home and no longer qualify for the credit, you pay the entire remaining balance (unless you sold at a loss).|`|BoAEgaAGaa	I have attached a link to the First Time Homebuyers info from the IRS.    There is a whole section about selling your home.  I do not see any 6% mentioned.     I hope this helps.    Laura H  H&R Block  Senior Tax Advisor 5   **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|AA11284831	Not true.  If you sell your home before the loan is paid back in 15 years then the balance of the loan must be paid out of the gain on the sale.  There are no additional "fees" other than repaying the unpaid balance.|`|0uWqjL2raa	David  If a taxpayer disposes of the principal residence for which a first-time homebuyers credit was allowed (or ceases using it as a principal residence) before the end of the 15-year recapture period, the remaining credit repayment amount is added to the income tax liability of the taxpayer for the year of sale or cessation of use.     If a first-time home buyer credit is allowed to a taxpayer, the taxpayer's income tax is increased by 6 2/3% of the amount of such credit for each taxable year in the 15-year "recapture period." The recapture period begins with the second taxable year following the year of purchase for which the credit is taken.     For example, if a taxpayer is allowed a $7,500 first-time home buyer credit in 2008, the taxpayer must recapture the credit amount by adding $500 (which is 6 2/3% of $7,500) to his income tax liability each year for 15 years, beginning in 2010.

sI3krJULaa	First of all, you don't have to incorporate or form any kind of separate entity in order to be able to give 1099s to "service vendors".  I have several clients with sole proprietorships who give out 1099s and W-2s.  It's just as simple, if not more simple.    I have a couple of musicians for clients, and they both operate under a sole proprietorship.  There's really not much risk involved, so you don't really need the limited liability.  If not for limiting liability, there's not much of a reason to go through the paperwork.  On top of that, the Schedule C for musicians isn't very complicated either.  The only time I'd be concerned is if he doesn't make money from this.  If that's the case, by starting a separate entity, he's protected from not being able to declare losses.  With a schedule C, he has to show a gain after a few years, otherwise, the IRS says it's not a job, that it's a "hobby", and they disallow any and all related expenses.    If that's the case, then I prefer the LLC form over the S-Corp form.  It's far less of a legal/accounting/paperwork nightmare.    Good luck! :0)|`|3XwxqcADaa	here's some info on an LLC (or Limited Liability Company):  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_lia...  http://www.llc.com/    and here's a link to info regarding an S-Corp:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_corporati...  http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/ObjectID...    I think this question is best answered by referring your husband to an attorney.  However, based on the information you presented, I (this is only my personal opinion, not fact) would choose the S-Corporation.  Again- your husband's situation requires more information.    good luck!
tmh42R6Caa	Yes, this will help you get points.  There is nothing wrong with the plan, besides the hassle of having to make almost daily payments.  Depending on your limit, maybe you could just make payments every 2 weeks or so?
63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	It depends on the policy of the business.  Also think about the customer.  Would you let any business keep your credit card with all the Identity thefts occurring now. Also think about the guy you got the card from, it may not be unpaid bills, he could have just mugged someone for the card.  Do you want to fight with him. If I had security backup I might think about it, if not I would give the card back and let him leave.  You are not the police!|`|0yqQg9CXaa	I would tell the customer there is a slight problem, and that I would have to call the mananger.    Taking her card away, and calling the police could get the business sued.  Especially if there was nothing wrong with the card.  /|`|vHB9zUcCaa	if a machine tells u to confiscate the card, maybe it IS stolen, u never know. i'd ask yer mgr what 2 do here about this. what u can also do is ask the cust 4 ID. if the ID don't match the name on the card THEN take it.|`|AOPuoo16aa	That means its probably stolen. Do not give the card back and call the police.|`|LddkW0JFaa	If I were you, I'd tell the customer that you're having a problem and call your manager over. Let the manager decide. It might just be a glitch with the card machine.
EzrdyxAiaa	nope you just allow the foreclosure to take place!!!!|`|b85YIs3daa	I would keep trying with the loan remod if you really want to keep your house. It should not matter, to you or the bank, what the value is if you continue to live there. Most remods will lump your late payments to the back of the loan and then lower your interest to around 4%. Have they done this and you still can't make it? They aren't going to lower the interest to 0%, so you need to figure out what you need the mortgage to be (by playing around with an ammoritization schedule/calculator). Figure out what is 28% of your gross monthly income. This is what your mortgage payment should be (excluding taxes and insurance...that doesn't count to the 28%). If lowering your interest to 4% does not bring it down to about the 28% level, then forget it. File for bankruptcy. Even after a foreclosure, they will come after you for the difference. Including the house in the bankruptcy will wipe everything clean so you can start over.|`|aeM7zeWWaa	Sorry to hear that. Did you attempt to negotiate the loan modification yourself? If so, and the bank said no, it could still be possible. A good loan modification company with their own dedicated attorneys can get remarkable concessions from banks. Foreclosure is bad news for the banks - they have to pay heavy penalties when they foreclose - they would much rather agree to a loan modification. Even if they reduce the interest rate by 30, 40 or 50% they probably won't make a loss on the deal - they'll just make less profit. I wish you the best of luck.
0yqQg9CXaa	Could it be from one of those banks that went under?  If so, when they get bought over by someone else sometimes the rules change.  /|`|WgT5l14baa	Sometimes statements contain other information.  Sometimes the law requires that these notices be delivered by mail.|`|jhNUuz0maa	Maybe the computer had a glitch and it defaulted everyone back to paper bills. Either that or there was a time limit set on the option where it went back to paper bills after 5 years or so. Might not have been done on purpose. Call the credit company and have them turn off the paper bill feature again.
JiUwpYSXaa	Yes, you owe taxes on the $10,000 settled debt.  What the government means that you had a windfall by not paying the $10,000 settled debt.|`|on9xLWegaa	Sounds like your debt to the credit card is gone, but you're going to pay tax on the forgiven debt.    use Turbo Tax for free and see where you are.  It will ask you to put in the 1099c information.    Unless you paid some estimated taxes, you might also get a penalty for not paying enough taxes.  but, try turbo tax.    The 1099C should have a "taxible" amount field on it.|`|z3XeFlxnaa	This counts as a windfall.  You only pay some tax on the $10,000.  The debt is gone though.    http://debt-help-debt.blogspot.com/

NwkZ5OmCaa	Only if you had a taxable gain.    Since you got the 1099-S, your real estate agent must have thought it was a taxable event.    List it on schedule D.  Show the sales price and your cost basis.  If you lost money, zero out the loss the column as losses cannot be claimed on your first or second home.    If you have a gain and this was your main home, you may be able to exclude up to $250,000 of gain (see IRS pub 523).|`|NG6eeCfuaa	Yes. 1099 forms have to be reported as income. It's going to raise your taxable income. It's also going to throw you out for filing with 1040EZ. Better hop on IRS.GOV and check out the 1040 or 1040A, as those are going to be how your going to have to file.|`|UVOQWLT7aa	if you used the money to buy an owner occupied home that you live in then probably not.

Simple way to find out is to see if its connected to her bank account.  Take some cash ot of a machine with it then check her bank statement on the machine or in the bank.  If it say the money has come out then its a debit card.    A credit card is attached to no account so therefore it should not be possible to do thsi.  Also if you use a credit card in a cash machine then it will charge you a few quid for the privilege.  Make sure it is a cash machine outside a bank and not in a shop because they will charge you regardless.    Hope that helps.

It looks like BOA, for example, has borrowed something close to $60 billion from the government in last few months.  At $10,000 a cd they would have to get 2 million people to open new accounts for a couple months in a row to raise that kind of money.  (a) Do you have that kind of money to lend them?  (b) Do you think anyone is going to lend them more than the FDIC limit?

They get $ from  very cheap from Federal Funds rate.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	Paying out a higher interest rate equates to banks paying out more money so they'll have less in their pockets. It would be like your borrowing money (getting money) to buy a home or a car. If things are tight and you need more and the borrower said, OK give me a higher interest rate and I'll give you more money. Well you're already strapped, the last thing you could afford is to pay a higher interest rate on a higher outstanding balance. You just couldn't do it. Banks may need more money. But they can't afford "high cost" money.

d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	We're all presuming that last year you got a refund of $775 on your state taxes, but the people above haven't given you the whole picture.     The state sends this to you as a precaution.  Some people need it.   Only the people who itemize their Federal taxes and deduct the amount of state income tax they paid.  (on 1040 Schedule A, line 5.)   This is weird. Bear with me.     The Federal government allows you to take a tax deduction on any amount you pay in income tax to a state. However this concept creates a catch-22: You don't know that amount until you finish your state taxes -- which in many states depends on you finishing your Federal taxes first. That's impossible!      Here's how they work that out.  You can deduct all the money the state took that year (withholding and checks you wrote them), even if it was too much.  BUT, if you do that and you later get a refund, you must treat it as new income.  It's kinda weird, but it works out.     So an example... Suppose, in 2007, the state withheld $8775.00 but when you worked out your taxes, you really owed the state $8000.  You got a $775 refund.  The IRS would have intended to let you deduct $8000, but there was no way of knowing that when you filed your 2007 taxes, so they allowed you to deduct $8775.00 and figured "if the state gives you a refund, we'll tax you on the refund amount in 2008."   And that's exactly what they would do.  The state would send you a 1099-G noting the $775.00 refund for 2007, the IRS would treat that at 2008 taxable income.  Strange, but workable.     Now if by chance you are screaming "But wait!  I didn't deduct my state taxes in 2007! I didn't check box A on line 5 of my Schedule A!"  then, that's true, that wouldn't be fair.  Check the 1040 instructions, but if I recall, no, you don't declare it as income even though you got a 1099-G.     It's also possible the $775 is for something other than a tax refund, like you were paid to testify for Congress, paid for an easement across your property, etc. etc.  If so, none of the above applies, it's just plain income.    Your state refund going up and down is not unusual, nothing to worry about.  The important thing is what the forms say at the end of the year.  Withholding is just a formality, they're "putting your money in safekeeping" because they do not trust you to write a huge check at the end of the year. (would you trust you? :)  Although some Americans don't have withholding, and do have to send huge checks quarterly.|`|6oC6k6hQaa	That is more than likely what your state refund was for last year......most states do provide this information, you will only need it if you utilize that option to claim payments or refunds on your federal taxes........unless the situation is different in your state and you are required to report on your state tax return.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	It usually refers to state income tax refunds, but may also include any other government payments, like unemployment, etc.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Most likely, that represents the refund you received from your State income tax.

joZFuLEwaa	jHi I am  a Real Estate Agent.  Basically it depends on how fast your lender is.  I have closed deals in two weeks and then there are other deals that closed in 45 days or more.  It just depends on your credit and situation.  Mainly depends on how quick you respond with all of the items the bank requests from you.  The faster you submit all of your required documents the faster the bank will have an aswer for you.|`|eWObKmBSaa	It takes as long as the person doing your work.

Then it goes to underwriting and titlework begins, assuming they can clear the title you will have to sign, depending on what state you are in, they will send a notary to your house or a lawyer and have you sign the mortgage docs. Then you have a 3 day right of recession, after you've exercised that option the company will usually wire any cash proceeds into your account and send payoffs to your current mortgage holder. Then you have 30-45 days to make your first payment.     To answer how long it takes really depends on you, and the company could be one week to 60 days. No more than 90 usually because your credit expires and they would have to pull it again.    Good luck!

There are many housing authorities all over Florida, each county has their own authority, so I can't tell you if the waiting list is open or not for the area that you live in.     First you apply for the waiting list, then when your number is up, then the actual application process begins, you don't need to have a job for it.     I am warning you that the wait is normally several years long if the waiting list is open, and that's if it is open.     I know in my area the waiting list is closed won't open again until 2010 and has been closed since 2006.|`|Svanlzg7aa	Section 8 housing usually has a long waiting list.

Its hardly your fault you have been made redundant|`|6W7nJYskaa	I doubt that it will be looked on unfavorably. You have to be honest on those things in case you get caught out anyway. It isn't worth the risk cause it will make you look really bad. Being made redundant was out of your control and so how can it make you look bad? It just happened that way. Be honest, that's my advice.    :-)|`|EjWi9vWYaa	There is no longer any stigma about being made redundant (being laid off). That being said, why would you put the reasons for leaving on your CV? You should mention them only if you are asked directly, or in a written application for a particular job.     Good luck,  Dave at Hired Fast Network, LLC|`|PoxGpbfzaa	Most Employers will want to know why you were made redundant. After all being made redundant is still being FIRED!  You should always be truthful however for your own good because it it a CRIMINAL OFFENCE to lie on an application form. It is classed as "Gaining Employment using pecuniary advantage" and is punishable by up to six years in prison.  You could always explain that the company were struggling to stay afloat and needed to make STAFF CUTBACKS. Based on the last in first out system. How could you say it was career progression when you did not have another job to walk into straight away anyway?  So in closing, be honest about your reason for leaving because most if not all employers will favour an honest candidate for a position rather than someone who is underhanded and sneaky.  Good luck with your career, I hope you get the job you are applying for and make a long career out of it!  ;-)  Garry.
eZDoQPg8aa	I prefer a middle of the road approach.  I don't like being swarmed by sales associates asking if they can help me every 30 seconds but I hate having to run all over 1/2 the store looking for someone to help me if I need it.      Business has finally come to the conclusion that in these tough economic times that people will shop where they actually get customer service and that customer service had better be good.  And many more people are taking an interest in becoming a DIY homeowner.  They can't afford to hire someone to do a project for them so they are willing to tackle it themselves.  Most home improvement projects are not rocket science; with a little education, the right tools and the right products nearly anyone can get a good result.|`|AA10590885	As the economy gets tight the WORD comes down from the top to make sure the customer is acknowledged etc.  The problem is: They should actually be able to help you once they offer.

My thought was - then don't waste my time with the rhetorical "How are you - are you finding every ting you need - just ask me if you need help".  A happy medium would be nice - the employee should look available, and not be busy in personal conversation or grooming - but cripes! Don't fain interest in my health and well-being.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	I get that it is annoying, but they are told to do this and I think I appreciate this more when I actually need something. In the end, I would rather patronize a store that values its customers and does whatever it takes to serve them. There is nothing worse than being in a store and you can't find someone to help you or everyone is rude to you: ex: Abercrombie and Fitch. When I used to shop there I felt like I was interrupting the employees flexing there muscles and putting on lips gloss if I needed even a dressing room.|`|G4wGCghdaa	It could just be the economy. The local Lowes, Home Depot and Menard's were all too busy to talk unless you initiated. Now with slower times I think workers are looking for things to fill their time. All these stores have many fewer workers than at this time 5 years ago. Maybe your Lowes' still has the same workforce. Just a thought.     I never could tell the difference in the workers to tell you the truth I was too busy scoping out the price and product differences.     I think they should just treat you like the insignificant addition to their bottom line then an actual human being.     I think all those Lowes workers should be ( insert sarcastic tone here) demoted or fired for interacting with customers.

He put 0 down and got a 3/1 ARM, Interest only. His payment is about to go up 1000 a month and he needs some help. Maybe the government should reduce his principal so he can make his payments.

Change the channel. I recommend easy-listening music, or smooth jazz.    Just where is this relief program you refer to? It does not exist. The money from the fed has gone to the bankers, not to homeowners.     Are some homeowners able to negotiate with their lenders to short sell, or refi, or seek some adjustment? Very few are able to do this--the banks prefer to foreclose if they have to take their lumps. Short sales are almost non-existent because banks reduced staff drastically.    So, nobody's getting any benefit from the fallen market, and that's why you should pay less attention to fearmongers on the radio.    You aren't screwed at all--you made an agreement with the bank and each of you is upholding the terms of that agreement.

Unfortunately, the software packages such as turbotax like to project your refund the whole time and give you teasers between each W-2.  This gets you excited and then disappointed as the last W-2 is entered.    1.  Yes, the more you make, the higher the tax bracket.  You are your husband are in the 15% tax bracket.      2.  the W-4s were fine.  Even with the last W-2, you do NOT owe.  My goal was always less than $500.  You are getting $1800.|`|qBCGH52haa	Tax brackets are based on combined income.  However, withholdings are based on only the income the employer sees.  So if the three incomes were all in the say 15% tax bracket, that's what your withholdings were based on.  However, added up, the total income could have been in the say 20% tax bracket and that's what you are taxed on, which means lowered returns.    First three tax brackets are at $11,000, $43,000 and $112,000. Most likely, all your income was taxed at the below $43,000 rate and your husband's second job put you over the $43,000 after deductions.

It is most likely that this would help ensure you never have to owe taxes (its not a definite, there are other factors to it).    Alot of people like getting that check from the IRS each year so if that is what you want, put Married - 1 on there.  If you prefer to not give an interest free loan to the government then put Married 3 and  you will see a little bit more in your take home pay each week and a smaller refund at tax time.|`|NrvrH4zQaa	Generally, assuming you file jointly, the spouse with the higher income should put the kids on his W-4 for withholding, while the lower earning spouse uses SINGLE - 0, if the incomes differ greatly.

You will need to go to BOA's website, and create a login.  You'll also need your credit card   and a check from your bank's checking account.  (it doesn't need to be a voided check - you just need the  's on the bottom.)    Once you have created an account and logged in, you'll be able to view the details of your credit card account.  Many banks are going with paperless statements, preferring you to just use their website.  I still prefer to get a paper statement, however.      To make a payment, you will need to tell BOA where the money is coming from.  They'll have instructions on how to do this.  You'll enter the bank's name, routing   and your checking account   (these are on the bottom of your checks)  Once that is done, you can schedule a payment.  You'll be given the option to pay the minimum, pay the full balance, or enter in your own amount.  Be sure  to read the information about how long it takes for a payment to post!  Some banks will date the transaction immediately (good!), but some wait up to 3 business days!  Be careful so you don't end up making a late payment!

This way you won't run into this again  Get the amont that is overdrawn put into your acct right away!|`|AA11281467	You probably had some outstanding charges when you checked your account.  Transactions don't go through right away, some charges take weeks to go through (example is gas).  Therefore if you checked your account one day the very next morning those outstanding transactions could have gone through and you would be over drawn.  The best thing to do is keep track of your finances yourself, therefore you always know how much you have.  Trust me, I have overdrawn my account several times before I learned to balance my own account.  All you have to do is deposit your overdrawn amount into your account and it will take you back to zero|`|XXIpmAL4aa	It is impossible to keep up with your true checking account balance if you are not keeping a manual record of it.  If you call right now, the balance you are given is not necessarily taking in to account all charges that are pending or checks that have not yet been presented.  Purchases made with the card at a store terminal aren't necessarily updating your bank balance for a day or two.   The convenience of check cards lulls people in to a lazy trap of overdraft fees and banks literally make BILLIONS on it.      You need this bad:  http://www.moneyinstructor.com/art/balan...    Just deposit money in the account to get it back to positive.  That's how you pay the fees.
qFidpKBMaa	I've had problems finding smaller cities with Monster. If you can, try a larger city that is close to you.    Also, If you are looking for a good job search engine site, try Indeed.com.

0yqQg9CXaa	With hospital bills they can not sue you as long as you make an effort to pay.  Send them $25 a month for the rest of your life - nothing will happen.  My husband had a traumatic head injury.    I had to come up with our maximum out of pocket of 10,000  I spent years, paying them each month on the 15th.    That's another thing, most insurance policies have a maximum out of pocket.  If this is through work, ask your hubby to check his insurance papers or call his HR person.    If anyone else answer this, please tell her if your insurance had a maximum yearly of pocket expense.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	First, look at your insurance plan coverage.  What is your deductible for the year.  Second, look at the part that says maximum out of pocket.  That information is very important and it will tell you the maximum you should be expected to pay.  I would call the insurance company first.  Dont call the hospital right away.  When you call the hospital billing department you want to know things first and be prepared to negotiate.  You are way ahead of yourself here.  Relax a bit.  Call your insurance company benefits person now and talk to them about it.  I think it will be much better than you think.  I hope so anyway.  Another thing:  There is something called a "stop loss".  It is the total that you should have to pay annually.  Regarding deductibles, there is also a family deductible.  You may have met your total family deductible with just your gynecology/delivery bills.    I would not recommend talking with HR at your husbands job.  Medical stuff is private and so is your financial situation.  They usually don't know about your health coverage detail specific questions anyway.  (My experience).  Also this is important....just because the hospital says you owe a certain amount, you can and should negotiate the amount.  It's done ALL the time.  Find out how much the hospital would get paid by the welfare system in your state, or by Medicare, and then offer that much.  Think about it!  If you didn't have private insurance and were on welfare they would only get so much from someone else.  Most people do not negotiate, afraid to I guess.  I'm not willing to write my source, but believe me I know what I'm talking about from experience.|`|eQZ5UNSaaa	Call the hospital, make sure everything is straight, and then see what kind of payment plans they have. Almost all have something they can do to help.|`|e3AnmkfUaa	You should move to Canada. The American medical establishment is predatory.|`|sI3krJULaa	I have never heard of a PPO without a maximum out-of-pocket for the year, and it's usually far less thatn what you're describing.  I would definitely call the hospital and your insurance carrier.  The average is from 5k to 15k.  That means you have to pay your deductible, which is usually anywhere from $300 per year to $5,000 per year (depending on how low you need your premium payments to be- a higher deductible will cost you less every month in premiums, but if something happens, you're liable for a larger chunk of money at that time), and over that, the insurance company pays a percent of the bills (usually around 60-80 percent).  That means you have to pay the other 20-40 percent once you've paid your deductible.  However, you only pay that percent of the medical bills up to your maximum yearly expense.    So by my calculations of even the most costly plans, you shouldn't owe more than around $20,000.  Sure, it's no small sum, but it's doable.  Especially if you follow Judy's advice and just ship away at it over time.    Good luck. :0)
gMs3U0YDaa	My GF had a similar situation with her taxes and her mom was being a total Bi*** about it. Your mom cannot claim you on her taxes unless she supported you AKA you lived in her house for the entire year! The burdon of proof will always fall on your mom if she gets audited, and she will get audited if you file for your own taxes and so does she. I spent an hour on the phone with the IRS to figure the whole thing out and it was a mess. But your mom does not have any right to claim you on her taxes anymore she will get a huge deduction for it and you will get shafted out of what ever you would have got because it will be in your moms name! and not only that you WONT get the stimilus package that obama is trying to pass if you dont file your self! and that going to be alot of money! you should file you own taxes and let you mom know that your doing so, and if she decides to try and claim anyway, she will get audited and be in some serious trouble with the IRS. Hope this helps! good luck
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if they stop paying him rent on a property that he owns, his credit is not messed up.    what messes his credit up is when the mortgage is not paid on time.    Who is paying the mortgage?     as he is coowner of this property then he should be getting a cut of the rent. Also if the mortagage is not being paid on time or if he is being hounded to pick up the payments because he is cosigner of the loan then he can take over the property.    If he no longer wants to be on the deed to the property or no longer wants this woman's son on it then he can either buy them out, have them buy him out OR he can quit claim the property and let them be the only owners of it (I do not recommend he quit claim if there is a loan with his name on it for this property because he would still be responsible for the loan but he wouldn't have possession to the property)    in answer to your question about your husband's poor judgement affecting your credit rating---it only affects you if you apply for something together.  If you apply for something on your own then only your credit rating is checked.

The only answer in the current climate is an online business where you don't have all the expenses of an offline business and basically you do it from home.

I've tried many programs over the last several years and I'm finally doing some that are working well and earning a good income.   One of the easiest and less costly is to become an affiliate for a few different websites or internet businesses. There is no cost to become an affiliate and they pay you for promoting their website. You just look at their website for a link (at the top or bottom) that is marked "affiliate." When you click on that it will take you to an affiliate page and also give you classified ads, banners, ezine articles, etc. that you can use. You can then promote these at no cost using classified ads, blogs, chat rooms, ezine articles, google groups, yahoo groups, forums, etc. You will also need to get your affiliate link from the website or business that you will put in your affiliate page that you are sending out (that's how you will get paid automatically).   If you want, you can look in the source section at a few of the websites I'm promoting.  It can be a little confusing at first on the internet, if you need any other help let me know Adam.

hFO5coFKaa	no more than 20% of your total investment should be in gold.  It's a nice hedge against the devalued dollar (which is on the horizen).  I personally buy the ETF, GLD, so I don't physically have to store the stuff.  remember storing gold in a bank safety deposit box is usually not insured if a catastrophe occurs. If u store it at home, be sure to get an alarm system and contact your homeowners policy broker. An ETF is an exchange traded fund and u buy and sell on the exchange like u would a stock. The fund holds the gold, you don't.  U buy at the rate of 10% of the current price of an ounce.  e.g. If gold is selling for $850 per ounce, you'll pay about $85 for one share (1/10 th of an ounce).|`|glIjTfnVaa	to risky.    buy shares in oil - its bound to go up in a few years|`|UVOQWLT7aa	gold would be a bad idea.

Also, people overseas will work for a whole let less than any American would. Even in this recession I often hear of people to proud to take a job below them.

rY8NF65taa	The difference between a 1099 and a W-2 is basically whether taxes are withheld on the income or not.  W-2 employees have tax withheld from their paychecks.  The receipt of a 1099 means that the trucking company is treating you as a "contract labor" and not withholding income tax on your behalf, nor paying employment taxes on your income.  I'm not sure how you could get both a 1099 and still have taxes withheld.  Whether or not you will receive a refund check depends on how much tax you owe based on your taxable income and the amount of tax you paid in during the year.  If he took out taxes, then you may be ok.  As an FYI, generally those that have their wages reported to them by 1099 is that they have to make estimated payments of tax quarterly, otherwise the IRS could penalize you for failing to pay the quarterly payments.

The indicators that the rest of us are seeing are indicating that we are only in the "warning" phase of our economic downfall and we have yet to see any economic tough times yet.     My guess is that the DOW will be around 6500 by the end of 2009.  Why?  Because the way the Government has been manipulating the markets for the past 15-20 years.  The US economy really should have a natural DOW set to b/w 6000 and 8500, but because everyone has been riding high on credit, we've been able to falsely inflate it.  Since the credit crisis hasn't come into full swing yet, you're gonna see a lot more company going out of business which will ripple through the all other markets.  Jobs will be lost (12.5% is about what unemployment was in The Great Depression btw) which will force prices to plummet, but not until wages plummet.  Plummeting wages and prices will force companies to shrink in size causing unemployment to rise even higher.    To make it even worse, the idiocy of the US Government to this point with all these bailouts is banking on the US Economy reviving to it's grossly inflated state which would put the DOW back to 12,000.  It's not going to happen.  The Govenment has pushed themselves to the brink of bankruptsy with these bailouts and likely will fall into it due to their own stupidity.  What we see looking back through history is that Government intervention into the Free Markets will always lengthen and worsen a recession, not the other way around.  The reasoning is simple, they price new comers out of the market, they reward the falthering businesses that put them in the spot in the first place, and they freak out all current business owners by changing the rules on them.  All of those will halt an economy, as they have done thus far.  Ontop of even that, the businesses that the government has bailed out have no obligation, intention, or ability to solve the problems that got them there in the first place, and the government seems to be pushing for laws to be passed that make it even more difficult for them to do so.    I think 2009 going into 2010 will be the beginning of the real problem in this country.

7TQ5qGWcaa	The National Bureau of Economic Research reckons that the present recession began in December 2007. In only one month since then has the US economy not lost jobs, but worryingly, the job losses are occurring with increasing momentum suggesting that the economy is spiraling downward.    Last week the US government announced that the unemployment rate rose this past December to 7.2% from 6.8% the month before. The US economy lost 2.6 million jobs in 2008, of which 1.9 million were lost in the past four months. Of these, 524,000 were lost in December alone.    Importantly, there are clear indications that employment will drop further. Companies have been cutting back on hours worked, which reached a record low in December of 33.3 hours per week. This measure is a leading indicator because companies first cut back on hours worked before they cut jobs. Also, layoffs are growing. The Wall Street Journal reports: The new year has brought no letup on layoffs, as employers have already announced more than 30,000 cuts.    (ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW)        The monthly unemployment report is prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics It reveals that the number of unemployed has climbed over the past year by 3.6 million to 11.1 million, but the real numbers are much worse when looking through the government sugar-coating in these reports. As The Wall Street Journal explains it: While the official unemployment rate is 7.2%, a different figure that includes discouraged workers who have dropped out of the labor force and those working part-time because they cant find full-time work hit 13.5% in December. That was nearly a full percentage point higher than in the previous month and up from 8.7% at the end of 2007.    While a 13.5% unemployment rate is shocking, the truth is even worse because the WSJ is still relying upon government reports. To get the unadorned picture, we need to turn to private economists, and I reply upon the work of John Williams of Shadow Government Statistics  who presents in his latest report the true picture of the dire unemployment situation: During the Clinton Administration, discouraged workers those had given up looking for a job because there were no jobs to be had were redefined so as to be counted only if they had been discouraged for less than a year. This time qualification defined away the bulk of the discouraged workers. Adding them back into the total unemployed, actual unemployment, as estimated by the SGS-Alternate Unemployment Measure, rose to 17.5% in December from 16.6% in November.|`|6JvAjG5kaa	here's an article on that:    http://www.ehow.com/how_4738456_survive-...

If you include total debt by the feds which includes Social Security and medicare its closer to 65 trillion insread of the 11 trillion they talk about. Money isn't backed by anything like gold. They keep printing more and more. Its going to be tough to recover.
XpKY04Tnaa	My Grandparents and Mother and Father survived the Great Depression just fine. Here are some of the lessons they learned and talked about quite frequently.    1. Never purchase anything new if you can somehow make do with what you have. Everything was used until it was wore out completely.   2. Never buy anything that you can make yourself. Grow a garden, make furniture, homemade foods,etc...  3. Never purchase anything new when something can be fixed. Learn to fix your own appliances, cars, homes.   4. Be willing to go where the jobs are. The single men in the family quite often would travel(hobo) to where the jobs where. Then send money home to support the other family members.   5. Be very conservative in all things financial. They literally buried their money in coffee cans and jars in the backyard.|`|masYIMRWaa	Unfortunately ...history repeats itself. I heard a lot about it (the depression time) from my grandparents. If they made it,  so will we.   I am building some raised beds in my backyard to plant veggies ...and I planted some fruit trees around. And I am learning how to be frugal.  Maybe you should learn how to raise chickens on your backyard and learn how to be self suffcient. It was tough then but I think this time will be worst because people are rotten spoiled and will have a hard time coping.

Your bank company can tell you where does money went to, to whom.    Tell them that you had nothing to do with it or used the credit card or gave away your pin, Sometimes they might ask if you have given your pin to someone.       Please be advised, have you gotten any calls from Telemarketing or from company's who is saying were are from a travel company and giving you long term with best discount, they will ask your card details and your backside for verification but its lie, never never gave away your backside card number! never, or they can take as much as they want from your credit card!    DO NOT CALL THE POLICE OR IT WILL MAKE IT MORE WORSE FOR YOU.      CALL THE BANK OF YOURS AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPEN AND THEY WILL SEND YOU APPLICATION THAT YOUR CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN HACKED AND SEND THEM BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE APPLICATION, THE BANK WILL REFUND YOUR MONEY BACK TO YOUR ACCOUNT CREDIT CARD AND YOUR BANK WILL FIND PEOPLE WHO HACKED YOUR CREDIT CARD!

fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Having "second thoughts" is not a legal reason to break your lease without monetary consequences.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Only if your lease has provisions that allow you to break it. Typically there is a penalty, and that's IF there is a clause allowing you to break it early.     Your best option is to help your landlord find a new tenant. You can stop paying rent once the next tenant is moved in and starts paying.     You may have an option to sub-lease but read your lease first, sometimes its not allowed. If you do this, make sure you consult a lawyer because there are legal issues to address. You are still responsible to the landlord for rent payment and making sure the unit is not damaged, if your sub-leasor fails to pay rent, or damages the unit, the issue is between you and them, and you still have legal obligations to the landlord, so be careful who you sub-lease to.     The only other chance is if your landlord violates the lease terms or local landlord-tenant laws in some way.     Sorry, lease is a legally binding contract, not something you can back out of just because you are having second thoughts.|`|HmiFGACXaa	You can not break the lease because of second thoughts and not have to pay a penalty.|`|qBCGH52haa	Given the business climate, I would expect that the best you can do is to negotiate with the landlord to continue paying rent until a new leasee can be found.|`|6ee8b8df4ec58a140006d364d199a258aa	You need to read over the lease a few times and see what you signed if you don't already know. You can talk to the landlord and see what it will take to get out. You might want to try 3 months of rent to get out. You might want to find someone to take over the lease. You signed the lease so you should try to figure out a fair outcome. It's not fair to the landlord for you to just walk away. I am sure the landlord has a mortgage. You should have expected it to be slow and not create any income for the first two years in business. Maybe try to make it work and advertising on the cheap with flyers, door to door, other businesses. Most businesses fail because of lack of capital. Don't give up, maybe change some things about the business, go in a different direction. Do you provide what people want?     Good Luck|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	It depends on what you mean by "just started". If you have completed negotiations and have a signed lease, if you break it they will go after you in court. You could try to find someone to take over the lease or buy the business from you.|`|aYNMs5vUaa	did you study the businees , if you have second thought well wait and be sure you want to do it, and if the less is good catch well you have to take decition. good luck|`|2PTzgYuvaa	usually you have 48 hours to change your mind...then no
2N6oTOLQaa	Depends on the situation. If they were a good customer I might give them a discount to keep their business until their insurance kicked back in for the next year, but I wouldn't just give my services away either. If they are taking up an appointment slot that could be filled with a patient that will pay full price, then its costing me money to give them a discount. That's the business concept of "opportunity lost"|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	It depends.  If my overhead/expenses for that visit were more than the copay, then of course not - I couldn't operate at a loss, and still stay in business.|`|obXAeNW5aa	most Doctors will not even see you if your insurance ran out|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	NO because with insurance you are getting the co-pay + the insurance, why would a medical professional only take the very small copay.  If the patient no longer had insurance some medical professionals will discount the rate.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	The co-pay is usually equal to 20 to 30 % of the total charges.  The doctor would lose a significant amount of money.  There is no way he could stay in business accepting only "co-pays" from people.|`|AA11598210	~~Most doctors can't afford to stay in practice doing this. You may be able to pay them the difference of what your insurance pays plus the copay. However, some can't even adjust that much. When going on a cash basis almost all doctors offer a 20 percent discount.    It never hurts to ask for whatever discount you can afford. It's ultimately up to the doctor to decide.~~
ZEwAalKPaa	You sold something for 123 and the buyer has paid via paypal - BUT - chances are it was not an 'instant' payment as the buyer did not have a credit card registered as a back up fund source in addition to their bank account so the payment has come by e-cheque. If that is so, you will wait up to 10 days for it to be cleared.  There may also be a delay if they did have a credit card registered and some or all of the payment came from this due to not enough funds in their bank account.    Mostly this is no problem, just means that you have to wait a bit. I had this the other week, got an e-cheque for a camera i sold for 125 took 8 days to clear.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Pending - not certain.  So you'll get your 123 when it clears in the bank.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	It means that someone send you 123 - but that it hasn't cleared the bank yet.  Give it a few more days.

OTBv9AsBaa	Do what your heart tells you to do for a career instead of going only where the money is! Still, at the same time, you will have to work in a career that will take care of you financially and will always pay the bills in addition to putting food on the table at all times. I have two college degrees. My Associate's degree is in Computer Information Systems and my Bachelor's degre is in Psychology. I screwed up BIG TIME myself by picking the wrong major for my Bachelor's degree. I love almost all academic subjects but, let's face it, there's no good, high paying jobs in Psychology at the Bachelor's degree level. I'm now back in school to reverse the "damage" I've done to myself by graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Information Systems, which is a field that's almost always in demand here in the US. I'm 29 years old and I thought I'd be totally financially independent in my life by now. That's why I'm currently sad and depressed. The lesson I want you to learn is go to college, pass every course with a B or better and always maintain a term and cumulative 3.0 GPA, pick a career that will almost always be in demand as well a career that pays very well with great benefits. If you don't, you'll be going back to school over and over again, which isn't a good feeling, especially as you get older. Teaching is a good career. I live in Baltimore, MD and teachers in my state can make an entry level  starting salary between $40,000 - $50,000. However, the hours are very long and the days are also very long, but if that's what you what to do, than I say do it. Teacher layoffs are becoming more and more common nationally too. I can tell you that the field of Social Science definitely isn't in demand at all nationally, even for teachers. You have to decide your career path on your own for yourself because no one else can ever really decide it for you. I hope my response helps answer your question. Good luck!
AA11947965	Like it or not, hiring managers do take how you look into consideration.    They want to know three things:    1. Does this person have demonstrated ability to do the job.  2. Can I afford this person.  3. Will this person embarrass my company and me if hired.    With an unkempt mustache and dandruff, the answer to the last question is yes.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	It is not discrimination but you can fix the issue yourself quite easily.    Buy a mustache trimmer and Head and shoulders shampoo.    Maybe I'm wrong but you mention the bushy mustache and dandruff - are you sure all the rest of you is clean and presentable?    No disrespect meant but just be sure all clothing is clean and pressed and the only odor coming from you is antiperspirant.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	If it is well-groomed then it shouldn't be a problem.  Go to a barber for a professional shave if you think it is messy looking.  There are some jobs in which they will spell it out if facial hair is forbidden.  As far as the dandruff goes, get a good shampoo, and wear clothes that may disguise the flakes - such as a lighter colored jacket.  Or wear one jacket in your car and have a clean one to change into just as you arrive at the interview.
IWbFqtQ3aa	Write in negotiable. That way you leave it open until the interview. Most places will already know what they will pay for a job.
XGaTLGxLaa	Check their terms of service, I'm sure it's in there. Basically, so long as it's in their terms of service they can pretty much do unscrupulous stuff like that. And then because in the Terms of Service it has a clause that allows them to change the terms of service at anytime, they can continue to invent ways to do stuff like this.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	yes but they are supposed to let you know in writing

NlieNMJwaa	You will want to keep  the customer happy and relaxed so I would  either  suggest a very light yellow which is a happy warm color or a white to relax them.    Other colors can really affect the screen of certain viewers, its worth testing and tracking with each color to work out  the best.    Or research your market and ask them up front.    You would be  doing it for their benefit so I don't see why they would not be co-operate.|`|0cd7030137d609db5865ec5a97d51d70aa	The first two people have given you some good advice. Were I in your shoes, I'd research the top 25-50 online shopping sites and borrow from their example(s). These are undoubtedly companies that have spent a good deal of money on research and design and know what works.    In my humble opinion, less is more. You don't want colors or patterns to compete with your products or to slow down the downloading process.    Again, check out the big online stores and see how they approach this issue.    Good luck.|`|ctdPl9kraa	It really depends on what you're selling and who you're target audience is etc.     The only thing I can say for certain is that the background colors should be light just to avoid the headache factor!
AA11284831	The IRS won't have your W-2 information until much later in the year.  W-2s are submitted to Social Security by employers.  The deadline is March 31st for electronic transmittal.  The SSA doesn't start releasing the data to the IRS until June or July.    Your refund will be based upon what you filed.  You will need to file an amended return on Form 1040-X.  As soon as you get the refund file the amended return and pay back the excess with the Form 1040-X.  You must do this by April 15th to avoid any penalties.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	I doubt the IRS would have your employers info this early to do cross checks - and I would not cash that check if it's 10 times more than it should be - you could incur penalties and interest - I would send the check back with the 1040x|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	welllll....your refund will be way too much...but anywayzzzz...you will have to file an amendment and you will owe back with interest and penalties what you were over paid.....

gewpiWY0aa	I now realize I can no longer buy and hold.  I suggest you find a local investment group and join some kind of website like Investools to figure out how to avoid huge losses your financial adviser would not prevent you from incurring.  Good luck.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	It sounds like you have a very poor financial adviser.    I handled my mother and grandmothers money for years (both have passed away last year).  Although I'd bet a nickle both were a good bit older than you are...here is my rule of thumb:    For investment accounts:  if you have 10 years or more to live in retirement and you don't mind a little risk, you can keep up to 50% of your money in stock based investments so long as (1) they are low cost, diversified, and you understand them and (2) you have at least 5 years worth of your annual expenses in cash within the account.    If you do not have 10 years left (based upon life expectancy) or you are afraid of risk, you should keep no more than 25% of your retirement money in stock based investments.      Exception:  if you expect to outlive some of your estate, that money can be invested as if it were the retirement money of the heir(s) of your estate.    Money outside of retirement accounts should be invested very conservatively after age 70:  money markets, CDs, savings bonds, Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds, and if you have enough for cheap purchases of guaranteed investment grade muni bonds.    At the time of her passing, my mothers money was 10% Total US Stock Index, 10% Total International Stock Index, 5% Convertable Stock, 25% Muni Bonds, 25% US Treasury Notes, Bills, TIPS Bonds, and 25% Cash (mostly CD's) & uber conservative money market funds like Vanguard Prime.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	First, I would tell my mother that she's likely learned about the volatility of equities and that she should not be in equities at all.

r67YzIv5aa	Are the toilets, vanity and sink just ugly or have plumbing problems?  If they're just ugly make sure they are clean and go on.  If they need replacing try your local flea market or Craigslist, they have great deals on vanities, sinks and toilets.      The basement area, I agree with the other poster, see if it could be the grading of the soil/mulch around that area.  If it is, re-grade and clean the basement and paint it (if possible) with a dry-lock paint.      Repair or replace the banister on the front steps      Replace the windows, if possible    These are all things FHA will definately fail your home for during an FHA appraisal, which most buyer's are using now.  Good Luck!!!!      The rest is cosmetic, may turn a buyer off, but no more than walking up the front steps and the banister wiggling or falling off.  Can you have the carpet professionally cleaned?|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Those are all maintenence issues and should be taken care of.

But bad carpets is one thing I hated when looking for a home.    /|`|HmiFGACXaa	It is hard to answer that question. It has to do with how much you owe, and how much your home would sell for.     You are looking at some expense and I do not know whether you would get the money back out.    Best bet is to contact a local realtor. I have one coming over Friday to tell us what to do. I too have a long list but know that many of the things I wanted to do will not affect the selling price. So, the realtor knows the market and will tell me what to do that will help the home sell quickly.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Don't worry about the cosmetic stuff (paint and flooring). That could actually be detrimental, if a prospective buyer doesn't like the design and/or colors you choose. You're better off letting someone possibly accepting the house as-is or requesting a flooring/painting allowance.    Items 2, 4, and 5 definitely. But, I wonder what would need to be done to fix the basement area. Maybe it's just a matter of doing some slight grading to run any water from rains more away from the house. If you don't do anything to fix it, just make sure you include it in the transfer disclosure statement.|`|Qqz0H2hEaa	Someone is really going to have to walk thru your house to give you this advice.     I would walk thru the house and look at it as a homebuyer would.  For instance around here we have had a bunch of news about "black mold" the last few years.  Even if it is all a hoax (I think the effect has at least been way overblown) most buyers and most insurance companies are very concerned about any water issue.  So around here it would be very important to get any water issue completely repaired before ever showing the house.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	the less the new buyers have to do the more money you can get. I would start off having the windows replaced, this is a easy fix and somethign very noticable by the buyers, second getting the basement floor is very imporant otherwise chacnes are people will back out after the home inspections are done,fix the banister at the stirs, buyers have to use that when looking at the house and it needs to be sturdy for safety precaustions, then replace the toilets, toilets are fairly cheap and again a easy fix. carpet for the two bedrooms is also a easy fix buy cheap carpet that is a nuetral color and then if you decide tp paint make sure it is nuetral colors.|`|pjt1Qh58aa	I agreee with the above answers that "the less the new buyers have to do the more money you can get."    I think the most important would be repairing the water damage and the basement floor, otherwise  home inspections will find the problem, inform the buyer and they will ask you to repair it anyway.

Edit:  here's the link, explaining the procedure:    http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	If you did not file in 2007 and get the rebate, you can file in 2008 and claim the "Rebate Recovery Credit".    Other than that, there is no reason to file.  If you did have taxes withheld from the Social Security, you will not receive a refund as you would not be eligible for the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Credit.

66SojoNLaa	I would say charge around $5 per hour, make sure to work it out with the family(s) you are going to sit for beforehand. To make some more money off of babysitting, get a license from the Red Cross or let the family know what specific skills you know such as cooking, cleaning, CPR, first aid, and past babysitting experiences. This will possibly make the family trust you more, shows you know what you are doing so the parents wont have to worry as much while their out. Saying this, you may be able to earn some extra cash.|`|AA11185479	Charge by hour, because a "night" can be anywhere from two hours to ten hours.  You should also have different prices depending on the number of kids - if there are three or more children, charge a higher rate.    Your rate will also depend on your quality of experience.  If you have never baby-sat before, or your idea of babysitting is "watch TV and make sure the kids don't kill themselves", then you should charge minimum wage.  If you have a lot of experience, are great with kids, have interactive and enriching activities planned, or offer housekeeping or petcare services as well, then you can charge much more.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Babysitting is a specialty job, not just a do job.

My wife watched this one kid all weekend ... like 24 hours straight and because of that it was cheap per hour ... but the kid slept through most of it, during the night and all.  I think it came out to around $4 or $5 an hour.    If it is a short sitting, like the couple going out for a date away from the kid, I would say around $10/hr or $30-$40 an evening.    Each job should be priced differently.  The longer the sitting, the cheaper per hour you can go.  But, for short stints I would charge more.
Pjm9pg7iaa	It is not a legal term with a strict definition. It is more of a slang term.   If you did not want short people to succeed, you could discriminate against them indirectly by telling every short person that they could not get promoted due to their lack of education. You never discriminated because of their height, but you made sure they didn't get promoted. It was indirect but it had the same effect..
sI3krJULaa	1.  Yes, he can be set up on payroll.  You just have to make sure he doesn't get paid an "unreasonable" salary for tax reasons.    2.  Yes, for my clients who have transactions through paypal, I set up a separate account as if it were a bank, since you can have balances sitting in a paypal account.  As for the fees, I'd set up an account called bank charges.  That's where your paypal fees would go, as well as any fees any other bank charges you, with the exception of interest, obviously.    Hope that helps. :0)
Y4WHnUZuaa	When I checked the IRS sight I got the same response. So like everyone else I freaked out and called the irs 8 times,until I finally got someone. The jerk I got on the phone said it takes up to 3 weeks and it hasnt been processed yet, so I then hung up and called again and the lady I talked to said it would be in my acct by Friday. I still wasnt convinced and since I filed with Tax ACT and paid for the prep out of my taxes I called them and the bank that takes out their charges, she said that they are exected to get the information from the IRS today sayng my deposit is on its way and then (before that bank even receives my money) they will send my money to my bank. So hopefully either tomorrow or Friday I will have my money! Hope this helps everyone!|`|19l3HzoCaa	I received the same message "deposited 1/23 don't call till 1/28 if it hasn't posted. I wasn't expecting it until 1/30. I called my bank just in case to see if they had received it and she said they have been receiving several calls today from people wondering where there refund was. Must be a glitch I hope. I don't feel like sitting for over an hour on the IRS hotline. I guess I'll wait till Friday!!!|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	Thank god we aren't the only ones. I was getting worried and was about to ask a similar question myself.|`|LNBFZ4Dcaa	same thing here -- IRS told me should have it by Friday 01/30 -- that is was an error in the system stating 01/23.  I guess we will see on Friday :)
AA10368727	Difficult to answer since we don't know what state and local taxes are where you live.  However, there's a great online tool that lets you plug in some information and figure that stuff out.  Check out the site referenced below:|`|WveXRwt4aa	Well the difference show in your weekly, bi weekly checks. You will receive about $20 in your pay check. The higher number you choose on your W4 will result in less of a tax return come tax season and may even result in you having to pay out rather than receive a refund. But I wouldn't worry because claiming 0-1-or even 2 is pretty safe. I hope this helps a bit!|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Roughly $10 per week or $20 per bi-weekly paycheck.    You can go here for some handy tools to "slice and dice" withholdings:  http://www.paycheckcity.com|`|ItLN7fCBaa	The answer depends upon where you live. Three variables to consider are Federal tax, state tax and even city tax (NY City only). It is true that you could consult a local HR professional in your area and get that answer. It is also true that you could estimate it yourself with research. Or you could ask someone similar. Note also that take-home pay is after the taxes above and other deductions (unempoyment. disability, health insurance if applicable). It's complicated.    Yes, the amount deducted increases in percentage when more income is earned in that paycheck. The more you make, the more they take. That increase is mostly taxes. Just be glad that you do not get paid monthly.

ODD7UZFuaa	just talk to the dealers... no credit is better than bad credit .  GOOD LUCK!   And i am not trying to sound sexist but when you go, take a male with you. when dealers see a young woman they tend to think that you dont know much about cars and how much they cost. if you cant do that then make sure to do lots or research (kellybluebook.com) to make sure your not paying more that the car is worth!

You will need to have a checking account and a job, those will be your bare minimum requirements as a young first time buyer.  If you do not have those things then they won't be able to help you get financed.|`|pt6wIlS1aa	Car places will help you with that, and gladly. The interest rate will be higher than getting a car loan through a bank, but you can shop around. Car places are hurting from low sales, so they will work with you.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	You cannot possibly afford this, so you should save up and pay cash.
puFafELwaa	baby sitting  walk the neighbor's dog  cut neighbor grass, for fee|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!

LqSciCrhaa	AZ,    It is NOT worth it.  If these are the only two debts that you have then you can pay them off.  There is always hidden charges, costs and fees to doing this.  Sure you'll have your card paid off right away but you have to take into account how much extra you'll be paying in the long run.  Much more than that.    Here are a couple of suggestions:    1.  Cut down your expenses.  Lower your phone bill, internet bill, don't eat out, don't go to movies (do red-box), sell things you don't need.  Put any extra money into this card.  You can pay off that $4,000 quick if you have discipline.      2.  You can go that route but my friend if you can't pay off that car in 2 years then it's not worth having.  I would sell the car.  Sell it and buy something much less expensive and then pay off the card.      Don't consolidate and don't re-finance.  It's not worth it in the end.|`|tvWm1e4naa	owing money from the bank is complicated. there are some hidden charges aside from the interest. best thing you can do is ask for the break down. Be upfront and don't be afraid to ask them. they are the only ones who can answer your question and don't hesitate to question them where the charges are coming from and how they compute it.  ask how much you had paid, how much you are going to pay monthly and for how long. sometimes you are only paying the interest and it doesn't cover the principal and when you had paid everything there's still some charges you have to pay to release the mortgage.|`|e71MWgJJaa	yes|`|UVOQWLT7aa	yes, interest on a car is simple interest and credit card is compounded. Now don't go out and use the credit card again though! If you keep your credit card down the banker is right. You can refi later because when your balance on your c/c is 40% or more your credit score goes down.  the real key is payment. Will your payment go up more than what you are currently paying on your c/c? if yes than maybe not.|`|XXIpmAL4aa	HORRIBLE IDEA, this is a ripoff.  "Giving you a check" means the $4k is moving in to the car balance.  Bad move.    Do an interest only analysis in each case and you'll see.    Currently:  $4000 @ 22% = around $74 per month in interest only   $20,000 @ 10% = $166.66 per month in interest.  Total = $241    Proposed:  Now assume you refi the 4k in to the car and increase the rate:  $4000 + $20,000 @ 15% = $300 per month interest    The key lies in the fact that the bigger balance rate will be going up a LOT.  The compounding methods make little difference.    Don't do it.  Better off finding a card with a better rate or paying the card off with a personal loan from a credit union.    Is this real or some kind of test question you are answering?|`|gMs3U0YDaa	you dont want to refinance your car into a higher interest rate, that will never benefit you. your better off trying to get a balance transfer to another card at in introductory rate, there is alot out there right now that will give you 0% for 6 months or a year just be careful of balance transfer fees some have them some dont. The difficult part of that scenario is your going to need some good credit to get a 4k dollar line on a credit card. from the sound of it you either have bad credit or very little credit and thats why your interest rates are redonculously high! stay away from student credid cards those are always the highest interest rates, and even if you can only transfer some of the balance to a lower interest card that will help alot! always pay off your highest interst rate first! hope this helps good luck!

4UYwiqLuaa	My wife is a degreed HR professional who hires assemblers, technicians, Ph.D.s to senior executives and CEOs.  She has 25 yrs experience.  Most of my info comes from her.  She can do a reference check in 1 day.  Sometimes the difficulty is in getting in touch with the other person.  They can be sick, on vacation, in meetings and may not return a call or voicemail message for several days sometimes.  At some point, if they do not get a call back, they may call you to ask for other references.  That's why it's best to supply 3 or more references.  In the past, I've supplied 6-8 references and prospective employers usually call/talk with about 3 of the 6-8 supplied.  Usual time frame is less than 1 week.
587456f2313741d92230d568d7cc751aaa	I have actually called the IRS 3 times today and spoken to live people.  I had to call for 3 different reasons, but each time I informed them of the situation with the WMR and refund hotlines.  The 1st rep I talked to had no idea and said it should be the 30th and that no one was getting a refund before then (except for RAL, etc).  The 2nd and 3rd reps verified that our return was indeed processed and would be DD on 1/30.  They both said that the date of 1/23 was a glitch and not correct and they saw the date of 1/30 on our account.  The best anyone can do at this time is wait for Friday morning to get here and see if it is in your account.  Trust me, I am the most impatient person in the world when it comes to getting money that belongs to me!  This is HARD!!  But after making 3 separate calls, I am content knowing that it will there Friday.  NOW...if I wake up Friday morning and it isn't there, I WILL be calling back every hour on the hour to find out what is up!  LOL  Oh, and the 3 reps I talked to were all in different departments, so I believe that at least one of them had to know what the heck they were talking about!|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The WMR tool is notoriously buggy and always has been.  Be patient.  Refunds are scheduled to start releasing on the 30th and it may take up until the 3rd to make it to your account.|`|pszeAtFkaa	If you kept checking the website...that is the reason...it only lets you check a certain amount of times under your ss .  If you did a joint return..check the website under your spouses ss .  My info still hasn't changed from the 23rd, but I am expecting it DD on the 30th, which is what I mostly heard.  I will call them if I don't receive by then.|`|jC5WmV37aa	hey ours says the same thing deposited on the 23rd check back after the 28th, well i called taxslayer and they told me to call irs, so i did held forever and finally was told that there is a glitch with the phones and wheres my refund site and it should be fixed in a few days but she also told us that the processing part takes 3 weeks so she couldnt give me a defnite date of dd...|`|JrRRnFsAaa	I have the same problem.  The WMR site says it was deposited on the 23rd and to check back with them on the 28th.  The automated phone system says the same thing.  I cannot figure out how to get a hold of a PERSON.  This is the 1st time I checked the site to see what the status of my refund was so I don't know what it said previously.  I have used direct deposit for years and have never run into a problem like this so I'm thinking it's a glitch.  There seem to be a lot of people with the same problem.        I do know that they only allow you to check your refund status a certain   of times with the website.  So that's probably why they are telling you they can't find your return.  I used turbo tax to file my taxes and they are telling me that my refund should be deposited on the 30th.  If I don't get the refund by then I'll try to get a hold of someone again.      FYI:  The IRS always does thier direct deposits on Fridays so you should always receive it in your acount at 12:01 am on that friday morning.|`|txD0J3iUaa	Okay So I called the IRS and they said that it was a glitch everyone who had that respond es should be getting there refund by the 30th.   I just checked where's my refund and now it is say this:  ''Your tax refund is scheduled to be direct deposited on January 30, 2009. If your refund is not credited to your account by February 4, 2009, check with your bank to find out if it has been received. Please wait until February 4, 2009 before you contact us again because we are unable to take any action until then.''    So it looks like that are fixing the systems we should be able to see it pend in our bank account tomorrow.|`|QlfcVZHPaa	i also cannot log in to irs website -same deal this morning it said 1/23  direct deposit.|`|G3FaHtvgaa	Same situation, except my refund info is still on website to check back with them by the 28th if no show in DD yet.  Says deposited on the 23rd!   I called 800829 1040 spoke to someone briefly who transferred me to the refund help desk.  They told me (recorded) they can't help me, too many others, call back tomorrow and hung up.  Let me reiterate I need my $%^&*$ @ refund :)
yPORekcFaa	Same here, Where's My Refund says our refund was direct deposited on Jan 23 but it's not there. The 2009 IRS e-file  Refund Cycle Chart does not show refunds went out on the 23rd.

tNaqdyhtaa	Hi,    There are now many jobs available online through which you can earn income from. They can range from home business and reselling, to filling up online surveys and affiliate marketing. One of the most popular ways of earning money online today is through online data entry jobs. There are a wide number of companies out there willing to pay your for providing this service.    There are so many businesses based both online and offline which are way stretched to their limits in meeting deadlines, day-to-day workload and dealing with clients. With all their tough processes, they find it best to delegate jobs instead and hire people online to do their data entry jobs. For this reason, the demand for jobs of this nature has multiplied in the recent years.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Most yes, some even want you pay usually in dollars loads up front for a 'HELP' package...silly amd a con.

TOIOyJ10aa	You are a EU citizen, so moving to Amsterdam would not become a problem, otherwise its (almost) impossible.  But, do not expect to find a nice, clean house. Everyone in Holland wants to live in Amsterdam, no joke. Why?? The best universities are located in Amsterdam, the best night life, etc.  So be sure to know that you will end up in a house that you wont like, or you're gonna be very lucky with someone who got you something. Most people who get a nice house in Amsterdam, and then I mean kids who already live there with there parents and want to move out, got connections. I dont know how the hell I'm gonna find a place I'll tell ya that.  Anyway, finding a job in a coffeeshop is NO problem, it will help to look for the job in spring or summer, why?? More tourist, more jobs.  Try Spuistraat and Haarlemmerstraat or The Red Light District. These places have the most coffeeshops. Best coffeeshop in my opinion: Greenhouse, don't think you'll get a job there though.  Minimum age working in a coffeeshop: 21.  1 thing that might become a problem, they really want experienced people, and by that I mean people who smoke weed. It's pure logic, you have to know what you're selling. It's a weird bussiness, good luck!! (sorry for misspellings)|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Move from where?  From within the EU?  no problem.  Otherwise, very difficult.|`|pNy8lakjaa	If you are living in the EU, it shouldn't be any problem.     If you are living outside the E.U. its no problem moving there, however the job aspect you are talking about is extremely complicated. If they want to hire you legally, they have prove that they looked all over the EU and cannot find anyone that is qualified to take the job, and that they had to look overseas to find someone suitable for the job.     Good Luck!|`|dpKntiZoaa	You are right. It's not "easy" no because this is a close knit community, and also one under threat (both due to closures and also the economy).    As a result, you are not going to find these kind of jobs advertised on Monsterboard, and it is more a case of networking - ie knowing a friend of a friend.     So the only thing I could suggest is that you visit A'dam, and talk to the people working there already.  Try to build yourself a network and then take a step in.
A1kiUMgvaa	At the moment there is nothing that you can do.  I about six weeks you should call the IRS and confirm that they have received your return.  You keep copies I hope.  If they don't have them in the six weeks you could copy what you sent today and send it again.  It is always a good idea to send anything that you send to the IRS as registered mail with a return receipt.  That will also avoid the "seal the envelope" issue.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	In the standard IRS envelope?  The Post Office has seen those before, they know where they go :) and will do their level best to get them there.       Even if the forms fell out of the envelope, there's enough information for the Post Office to get it either back to you or to the IRS.   Probably back to you.    I've forgotten to put stamps on my IRS forms before, yeah I'm that dumb.  I keep copies of everything I file, so my solution was to make another copy from those, and send those in a second envelope with stamp, essentially "double filing" my taxes. The second copy had a note explaining I was filing these copies because the originals might have been lost in the mail.|`|pszeAtFkaa	Either go down there or call & ask to talk to a Supervisor.  I have received some mail before that they forgot to seal & it was thrown in a clear bag and sealed from the postoffice.     If they are unable to help you, the only thing you can do is relax.  Seriously, we all have done things like this & stressing over something that you can't change is only going to make it worse.  In a week or so, call the IRS and make sure that they received all of your paperwork & nothing was missing.  Then, just to be on the safe side...monitor your credit report or even put a fraud alert on your credit report.     Good luck & relax!!

qBCGH52haa	First, your husband should have reported his return to work to the Social Security Administration.  Since he was not full retirement age, he should have had a portion of his Social Security payments offset (reduced).  Up to the year of full retirement, the rule states that for every $2 earned over an approximate $13,800 (it is $14,160 in2009), Social Security was to be reduced by $1.  Since your husband earned about $18,500, that means he earned about $4,700 much.  This should have reduced his payments by $2,350 or about $200 per month.  They will be collected by the SSA.    This year, if he continues to earn the same amount (let's say $1,500 a month), his earnings will be reduced $1 for each $3 earned over the limit (he reaches 65 this year) for January and February.  Since the new limit is about $1180/month, that is about $320 extra or about $100 less for those two months.  From March on, since he reaches full retirement, he has no further reduction and goes back to his normal rate.    Edit:    I just noticed you put this under India - the above only applies to the U.S.|`|ZUKz3XDvaa	What check?  His earnings?  Disability?  What check are you talking about?
7TQ5qGWcaa	As most founders know, or come to learn, finding the right business partner or co-founder is among the most importantand difficultthings we do as entrepreneurs. In 2003 I came up with a killer idea for a new RFID product. I talked about it with a great friend of mine who was also interested in starting a business, and we decided that wed find a third co-founder who would have the engineering skills to complement our business, marketing, and programming skills. We put the business plan together, developed the brand, got the product details down on paper, and began looking for a third business partner with electrical engineering experience. We looked, and looked, and looked    Our search for our third partner lasted about 9 months. We never found the engineer we needed to get the business going. Throughout the process, I kept asking myself why there wasnt a way to find business partners online, so I came up with an idea for one, and I founded PartnerUp. PartnerUp serves as a network where entrepreneurs can find the business partners, co-founders, board members, executives, advisors, and professionals they need to start and/or run their business.    Through all of my experiences, good and bad, and hundreds of other entrepreneurs that weve talked to during development of the PartnerUp site, Ive learned a lot about finding the right business partner. Below are some tips for what to think about when looking for your cofounder. Hopefully, they make the process a little easier for you.     1 Know what you need.  So, youve decided that you need a business partner. Now what? Well, the first and most important step is knowing exactly what skills and experience you need to make your business a success. Id first make a brief list of the skills and experience (think sales, engineering, marketing, operations, business development, etc.) that you will need in order to make your business idea a success.    Then, from that list, make a list of the things that you can bring to the table on your own, and be honest with yourself about what roles youll be able to do, and what skills and experience you just dont have. It might be fun to learn how to do marketing, but dont learn on a viable business venture. You might just make it unviable. After you cross off the items on your list that you have the skills and experience to handle yourself, the items that are left on the list are the things you really need to look for in a business partner. Now that you know what you need, stick to it. The best partnerships work because each partner has something different to bring to the table and can do things that you cant do on your own.     2 Look in the right places.  Now that you know what you need and what to look for, there are a lot of places that you can try looking for a business partner/co-founder. When I was starting my RFID venture, I pretty much tried them all. I went to every local networking event that I could find. I started talking with old friends and seeing where they were at and if they knew anyone who fit the bill for what I was looking for. I placed a few ads on job sites. And, I found zero leads.    In retrospect, I could have saved myself a lot of time and effort by targeting my efforts on some specific areas. First, of course, try PartnerUp, since the reason that we created it was to help people find business partners/co-founders. When I was trying to find a partner, there wasnt a service like PartnerUp available, so now that there is, why not use it?    At the same time, now that youve already figured out what skills and experience you need, you should be able to start targeting people that fit the bill. If youre looking for an electrical engineer, find out what local trade associations and networking events exist for electrical engineers and go to those events. Then, try calling some professors at your local university and seeing if they know of any entrepreneurial students, alums, or professors who might be interested in your idea. Finally, dont forget about existing contacts that you have who could potentially know someone who has the skills and experience that youre looking for.     3 Be picky.  Get to know potential partners before taking the plunge. During your search for the right business partner for your business you will most likely meet many intelligent, great business people. Will they all be right for you and your business? Absolutely not.    The smartest thing you can do for yourself and the success of your business is to be picky about the people you choose to bring in as your partners. Interview them, ask them every question you can think of, make lists of what you want the person to contribute, and dont let emotions get the best of you. Just because the person may have been your best friend for 10 years, does not mean they will be the best fit for your business, and if you bring them on just because they have been your best friend, you will likely both be disappointed in the outcome

The reason why companies did not invite you for an interview for clerical, telemarketing, secretary, nanny, etc is because you are over qualified.  Their mentality is that you'll quit once the market picks up.  There's work out there, so it's not as if the economy shut down completely.  You need to start networking with architects and builders.  You can start by volunteering for AIA functions.  Go to Home shows, the International Building Show will be in Las Vegas this week.  On whatever free time you have, start working on software like SketchUP, it's free for download, so there is no excuse for not having on your computer.

ImU2a9Braa	State appraiser boards often have lists of acceptable providers of qualifying education.  Don't take any classes until you have checked with your state board regarding this.  It is also wise to obtain a complete understanding of the entire licensing process so that you don't discover too late that it's more involved than you think.    Trainee appraisers generally have to be registered as such with the board, have to find a mentor, keep logs of their experience, acquire continuing education credits, and eventually pass a national exam.

You need to take it back and get it credited to the card.  You need to contact the number on the back of the card and return it or cut it up.  The owner and guarantor of the card should contact his bank and stop payment on the card, but he may not know it is missing.  Do not use money that does not belong to you.   You can end up in prison.  Even if you live in GA, you can be that smart.|`|MS5OBY9Waa	You could get charged with credit card fraud.

And for everyone saying that you need a PIN- how many times have you gone into the store and charged something on credit- never entering a PIN and the cashier didn't check your I.D. It happens all the time.  Also, a lot of people use self-checkouts, and pay-at-the-pump, where there are no cashiers to check your info.|`|nQLtGEEgaa	UhHhHh... Ur gonna go to jail which u should..

YQ1Q7XeEaa	Rule of thumb - if they won't tell you what they do and exactly what duties they are looking for you to fulfill - run.    Call them back and very politely ask what products they sell or create and what the position is designed to do.    If they ask why just say you are trying to prepare for the interview.    I have interviewed literally thousands of people and I have never ever had a hard time telling people what I am interviewing for.    If they still won't give you a straight answer - at best it's some sort of multi tiered marketing firm like vector (they make awesome cutlery but they want you to sell it to your friends and neighbors and then door to door) - at worst it's an outright scam.|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	Yes, I agree...  The other thing is that when they rush you to the interview, it's usually a high turnover position.  They are a marketing firm, I believe and they used to focus on Sports Marketing, but have branched off a little into other things.  Also, beware of the companies that have mass interviews in Hotel conference or ballrooms.  That's simply a "herd 'em in" mentality because they know that only about 10% of the people in the room will be interested after the motivational speaker raves about how great the company is.  And, what they won't tell you, is that less than 1% of the people that start with the company will actually make a living at the company.|`|wlO6zFHNaa	you're right they don't give alot of information. If they don't give u the information you are looking for don't go. It must be a sales job where you go out and sale body spray and then they want you to open a store in a different city. lol... Had a friend suckered into a business like this..    good luck if you do go.

wQJBFcluaa	Apparently Prophet 1102 does not understand what SimplePay is with H & R Block.Last year if you remember the people whose chose SimplePay had an additional wait for their refunds to be deposited from the H & R Block Bank to their bank.Hopefully the problems from last year have been fixed.      Update  Michelle,last year H & R quit using the bank they had used for years and started using their bank,H & R Block Bank for people using any of the loan products..RALs,RACs ect and SimplePay products.So from what you have said about talking to H & R it sounds like the same deal as last year.Last year the IRS sent my refund to the H and R Bank on 1/25.But because I used SimplePay I didn't have it in MY bank account until 1/30.And my bank makes funds available the day they get the direct deposits.Please update if you find anything else out and I will do the same.

However, this will not give you an actual score, it will simply show your credit history, both good and bad entries. This is a good way to annually check to make sure your identity has not been stolen.    Outside of this, to get a credit score, you can go about it a few ways, the first being to go to freecreditreport.com. However, despite what they say, you have to pay for this service. How it works is you enroll in their credit protector program, and they give you a copy of your credit report and credit score. What you can do is enroll, wait until you get the report, and then dis-enroll within 30 days.    Your last option is to go to a car lot. You can ask them to run a credit check on you. Be sure to ask them to give you a copy of the report. However, I would not advise doing this unless you are looking at making a car purchase. This is what is known as a hard it on your credit history, and you will lose a few points just for the inquiry.    I hope this helps, good luck!

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	If it was sent to you by someone you don't know, it's almost certainly a scam.    If there is any request for you to send them a payment back of ANY amount, or a fee required to receive "the rest" of you payment...it's 100% scam.    And mostly - all you need is common sense to avoid these things.    Ask yourself why any legitimate business would send a total random stranger EITHER a job offer, or money un-asked for.  If it makes no sense, it's because they're trying to play on your greed to get either your money, or your personal information.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	It's a scam.

NwkZ5OmCaa	Re-Wiring is an improvement to the property.  It is added to your cost basis.  There never was a deduction for it.  I have no clue what your accountant was talking about.
SAgCy83Oaa	You're obviously not in a position to file as married-filing-jointly, since you won't be able to get her to sign your return.  You can file as married-filing-separately and - if you can demonstrate that YOU have provided more than half of the costs for the child, you can claim your child.  But you can't claim him JUST because you are paying child support.  You have to be able to show the more-than-50% level of spending - including housing, food, clothing, other incidentals.  That's a difficult thing to do if you are not the custodial parent.  If you don't want to try to justify the child's dependency status, then jut go ahead and file the married-separately status.  She has to, then, file her own return.  Sorry, you can't deduct the child support payments, but if anything you paid is legally "alimony" you can deduct that.|`|1H7aNVT3aa	Not without her signature.|`|LCqiO7O3aa	If you file as married filing jointly, she has to sign the return.  You have a child together so if it were me I would start learning how to be patient and learn what to fight for.
d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	You both have to sign the return to file jointly.  So you can only do that if she agrees to.  It is one tax return, with all your income and withholding reported on the one return.  Any refund will be issued to you jointly, and you both have to sign the check.    The one who claims your son is the one who paid over 50% of his total support.  (rent/mortgage, food, utilities, clothing, everything...take the total, divide it in half - whoever contributed more than half that amount claims him)|`|zuGKIWfNaa	No. If you are married filing jointly, you turn in ONE return with all the information for BOTH of you on that one return.|`|suWnr83laa	If you are filing jointly then you will have to include her income from her W-2's.  She may not be "taking too long playing around" with her W-2. The deadline for employers to send them out has not even occurred yet.|`|egN478Bbaa	You can file "married filing separately"
cwKNDZz9aa	You have to take a guess. You cannot know the answer until the END of the year when you actually complete your income tax return.     You can CHANGE your withholding any time you want.     When you prepare this year's tax return, use a pay stub to ESTIMATE what next year's return will look like, and make adjustments as necessary.    What if you get a new job, or lose your job, or get a raise?|`|BoAEgaAGaa	The more you claim on your W-4 the less tax is withheld.  There is a worksheet when filling out the W-4 that could give you a better guidance as to how many to claim.  Since you have children and are single, you probably are receiving credits that lower your tax making it possible for you to have less tax withheld.    Bottom line, you are the one to determine if you want a nice refund or you want to receive more in your pocket throughout the year.  I'm sure the worksheet will help you decide.

Single with 2 kids and only one job, the W-4's instructions say you should claim Single-4.    So, I would claim Single-3 and have $50/month direct-deposited into a separate savings account.  That way, you get to keep the extra buck or two in interest.    Edit: To Radtech: if you claim the true deductions instead of 0, and have direct-deposited $200/check (assuming you're paid twice a month or every two weeks), you accomplish the same thing, but you keep the interest instead of giving it away.  And if you spend it before it builds up to $5,000, well, it's your money, right?|`|YWQdsoOMaa	First it depends on what you make for the year.  If you think you will make more than 40,000 dollars, you should claim zero and exempt.  If you make less than 40,000 dollars, you can claim yourself twice because you are the only one working and you can claim the children once or maybe twice, depending on other things. So technically you can claim from zero to six.  But if you do even claim one, you can't have the exempt.  Just depends how much of your money you want to keep and if you want to pay the taxes or get a tax return.|`|UVOQWLT7aa	claim head of household with 2 dependents.

I have never owed taxes. I make just around 30-44,000 Depending on the year.  If I make least I get more back. If I clear the 33,000 mark I get less back at the end of the year because of the EIC , but I get less taken out of each check. So it really depend on you.     I use to just claim 2, and get the bigger refund at the end of the yr until I made over 33,000 and didn't get much back and was told that it would be better to claim more and get less taken out each week because unless I make about 50,000 or more I would not owe taxes.

NsbGM74iaa	Yea not too many people know about this tax rule but its completely fair and has been enforced ever since the Crane vs. Commissioner case.

Imagine having $100k of debt forgiven only to be included as taxable income.  People don't deserve completely free rides.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Let's see.      We both owe credit card debt.  I scrape and pay 100% and you settle it for 50%.  You are "better off" economically because you didn't have to come up with the other 50%.    Consequently, when the credit card company cancelled the remaining 50%, it was considered income by the IRS.  Unless you can show that the debt was dischared in bankruptcy, you are insolvent, or if this was a business debt, the interest would have been deductible on your tax return, you have to show this as income.

2N6oTOLQaa	File your taxes like normal.    Look for a line item called "recovery Rebate credit" On the 1040 it is line 70. I'm not sure if its on 1040A or 1040-EZ, you'll have to check.    You fill out a worksheet that helps you determine how much of a rebate you should have gotten, and you subtract what you actually got and then you claim the difference as a refundable tax credit. So if you were supposed to get $600 but never did, the worksheet will tell you to put $600 on form 1040 line 70, which will make your refund $600 bigger.     It works the same way for people who did not receive a full rebate because of their income in 2007 but had their income change in 2008, and for people who had children in 2008 or anyone else who didn't receive their full rebate for any reason.    If you are using Turbo Tax or any other Tax software, it will handle this for you.

They believe that whilst the rest of us lose our jobs or, as in your case, have a job but know that a pay rise is unlikely, they should still be earning fat salaries with large increases and bonuses and benefits packages each year.    What sickens me is the poorest boroughs, like Haringey in North London, are the worst for paying their staff ridiculous amounts.    You might want to look into something like Shared Ownership.

And yes, it's true that if you have a mortgage, your outgoings go down in time because your payments are stable, whereas someone renting will always face rent increases, but remember that many of those who have bought recently are now facing negative equity which is not an enviable position to be in.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Sorry mate but this is a pretty dumb question.  People with mortgages will save a fair bit if their original interest rate is dropped but they will still be paying far far more than you will be paying in a council property.  Another point, something goes wrong with your council property the council fix it, some thing goes wrong with a private property and the owner pays the repair bill.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	If you think you would be better off with a mortgage, why not go get one?  You will only need a 40% deposit.  And please remember to budget for monthly outgoings you have never had to consider- like central heating maintenance, plumbing and electrical repairs, and buildings insurance.|`|TLgiTFh4aa	You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.  YOU are saving a fortune, living in Council owned accommodation!  Most people who have a mortgage haven't been affected by the recent tax reduction, as they either have a fixed rate mortgage, or their lenders haven't passed the reduction on to them.  By the way, have you any idea how much a 150,000 (the price of a VERY modest 2 bed-roomed flat) 25 year mortgage costs a month?  I think you would soon eat your words if you did.    OK, go and find out how much you would be paying for a 90,000 mortgage! About 600 a month is how much, JUST for the mortgage... not including all the Insurance, repairs, maintenance, decorating, plus of course all the other utility stuff. You're not on that bad a wage, indeed 8.60 an hour isn't to be frowned at, but still you complain you're hard done by?  My heart bleeds.  You have far more disposable income than most, so stop moaning.|`|AA12349988	Jealous much?    Where you offering to pay more when my interest rates where going up?  I doubt it.    A housing association has just brought a load of houses on my new estate - my mortgage (168,000 over 30 years) over 700 a month rent 67 a week.    Yes my mortgage has gone down (it used to be over 1,000) but it is still more than people living 5 doors down for the same house.    If you want to save for a deposit on a house - get a second job that what I did when I was younger, put yourself through open university to increase your chances of a higher salary - I did.    But then I am a doer and an Achiever!!

I told them to try to find an incrediably cheap foreclosure house that would pencil out to cost at or less than an apartment each month, and just to make sure it was in a decent neighborhood in good shape.      They found about 20 for under $50,000 and went for it, the bank let them have the house for $2,000 down!  Do some looking around and see if you can find the same thing in your area.

So if you are renting and someone comes along and wants to buy the house you are living in, you screwed. On the other hand buying a house now is tricky as well because banks are not handing out mortgages and the prices on the mortgages come in and out like the tide.

Exemptions/allowances is the number you use to try and get it right at the end of the year. Sounds like you are too high and possibly owe some tax this year. You should fill out another W4 and put 0, that way your employer will hold more federal income tax each pay check. See IRS Pub 15 and the with holding tables to see what will be taken out each pay check.    It's a good idea to get a mid year "how-goes-it to see how your with compares to your tax liability.

C2kNctvkaa	Yes I was denied this year, so was almost everyone I know that opted for the RAL Loan, I filed on the 16th and I'm supposed to receive my refund 1/30/09 but now SBBT says that it might be 3 business days after the 30th, they receive it from the IRS on Fridays and it may take up to a week for them to deposit it, check the status of your RAL with this link and find out    https://cisc.sbbtral.com/|`|D3Dhiv3Gaa	SBBT has been turning down anyone getting the recovery rebate. Why, I do not know.|`|zE09edGtaa	I went to H & R block and have never been turned down. My poor credit was like in low 400's last year and still wasn't denied anything from RAL or the early loan that they gave.|`|kHjv7wFlaa	Don't know why the IRS would delay your refund..but, i know that i have tried to get the RAL and the first year i did receive it but last year i didn't get it and when i asked my tax preparer she remarked that she had no idea why, and i would receive confirmation from the lending source within a few weeks, turns out that after reviewing my credit they turned me down, but i didn't receive the actual letter from the lending source until June of last year, that was almost 4 months after doing my taxes, anyways it really makes no sense that your credit would have anything to do with it as they are giving you the loan and receiving your tax refund anyways so its not like there is any way you can stiff them...but we live in a world that goes based on credit more than it ever has before in history it seems. anyways hope this info helped out a bit...good luck!

You may have misunderstood the first.  You can not just add a 2007 W2 to your 2008 income.      1)  You must amend your 2007 return to include the missing income.    2)  You can only file 2008 after you have all of your income information (ie.  ALL of your W2s).|`|eojDX3itaa	You should amend your 2007 tax return to include the income  and withholdings from that last W2.

How much money is made all depends on many factors.    - Your available funds/costs  - Your available time to work on the business  - What your income goals are (Very important)  - Your level of seriousness (THE MOST IMPORTANT)  - What you actually want to do (Which area of interest)  ... Just to name a few.    Once you have figured some of these out, then it is time to look around in the chosen areas. Get creative and take initiative.

How long (and hard) are you willing to work to meet your goal?    - Determine if you are looking for a JOB or a BUSINESS -- there is a distinct difference between the two and you want to focus your energies appropriately for the best results.    - If looking for a JOB, what are your marketable skills and previous experiences? If you are looking for a BUSINESS, go with your passions, things that interest and motivate you the most. Build a list and use that to begin your search. General rule of thumb: Never pay for a job (businesses, on the other hand, usually involve some expenses). I recommend checking out the Telecommuting Moms folder here at WAHM.com for leads on home JOBS. I also have some resources for freelance work and telecommuting jobs on my Work From Home site.    - Review your budget -- know ahead of time what you are willing and able to invest into your business, including start-up costs and ongoing maintenance and promotion.    - Find a rep to contact, check out their websites, ask questions, do your own independent research. Check resources such as www.bbb.org for potential scams.|`|lthNfh8vaa	A great home based business is a Virtual Assistant business.  A Virtual Assistant is an independent entrepreneur who provides a variety of services, virtually, to businesses that are in need of administrative support.     A Virtual Assistant can provide such services as word processing, data entry, email management, bookkeeping, web design, and much more.  If you are interested in any of these services you may want to consider becoming a Virtual Assistant.    While you can make good money as a Virtual Assistant, it does take time.  You have to have patience, be persistent, and also have determination.  When you do get your clientele, however, you will be glad that you kept moving forward.  It is a great business and one that I truly enjoy.    If you would like to do your research on Virtual Assistance, I would recommend the website VAnetworking.  It is a great website for VA's.  I found this website before I started my VA business and I really enjoy being a member.  They offer such things as free eseminars, a forum to talk to other VA's, free membership, and much more.

I feel it's always safer to have a business of your own (i.e., your own skill or passion) however, most people do not have the start up capital.  In my opinion, little $20-$50 "opportunities" aren't worth anything!     If you resell a little crappy $20 website a few times to your list, you'll make a few hundred bucks, sure. But on the down side, it can effect your reputation. You always want people to feel like they're getting the best for their money and the HIGHEST quality business.

SAgCy83Oaa	If the job is temporary, you might be able to maintain your California residency.  But New York has certain rules about how long you can live there before you have to do things like get a NY driver's license, pay NY taxes.  You don't "file" taxes.  You file a tax RETURN, and you can file in California if you want.  But if NY starts withholding taxes from your salary, you will have to file a NY return to get any of that money "back."  Only in the military (and probably a few other Federal employments) can you maintain a "primary" residence other than where you are residing currently.|`|AA10590885	How about paying state taxes in 2 locations - check the web sites for both states and see how they handle it.

If you claim to be a CA resident, then CA is likely  to view that income as taxable in CA also (many states  take this view; I can't of course say for sure what CA will  do, but I have seen this happen often enough to want you  to be aware of the issue).  Usually when this double taxation happens, the remedy is  a tax credit on one of the state's tax returns for the amount  of tax paid to another state.    Robyn M.

AA10368727	Your employer is required to furnish you with your Form W2 by January 31st of each year.

AA10368727	Ultimately, your employer is responsible for paying you the wages you earned for working.    Your former employer should replace the check that ADP printed for you.  You simply tell them that you had misplaced the check and you need them to replace it.    "The money's been accounted for" is not an excuse.  Whatever accounting they did to "account" for it needs to be reversed and you need to be paid.  This is the former employer's responsibility, not ADP.

Ns6I7MmBaa	Form 1040 and Schedule A (and instructions).  Figure out your itemized deductions (properly) and if they add up to less than standard deduction, take the standard deduction.
2N6oTOLQaa	Just follow the worksheet:    Line A: put 1 because your parents can no longer claim you as their dependent, because you are married.    Line B: Put 2 because you are married, you have only 1 job, and your spouse does not work    Line C: Put 1 because your spouse's parents can no longer claim her as their dependents.    You have no kids and you will not be head of household, and you will not itemize deductions, so leave lines D thru H blank.     Add all the lines and you'll get 3 allowances.     An "allowance" is an estimate of how much money you'll be able to make without paying taxes. Each allowance represents roughly $3500 of untaxed money.    The good news is that you can't really mess up your W-4 too badly. If you don't claim enough allowances, they'll take a little more out of each paycheck and you'll get a bigger refund. If you claim too many, they'll take less out and you'll get a smaller refund or end up owing a little bit. Either way, your W-4 doesn't Impact the total amount of money you send to the IRS, it only determines how much they take out of each check, but any errors will be fixed with your refund.|`|AA11562326	If you would be safe, just put down 1 allowance.  That influences how much tax is witheld from your paycheck.  Maybe your pay is $800, but when you get the check, it's really $700, because your employer holds some of the money back and sends it to the state and federal government as taxes.  In April, when you file your tax returns, you may get some of that back, or may have to pay a little.    If you somehow know that your tax will be lower than what they're witholding, then you can claim additional allowances.  For example, if you donate $80 of your paycheck to your church every paycheck, your taxes are going to be lower than what the government figures.  To compensate, you would claim one or more extra allowances.    Your taxes should also go down since you're married, and your wife isn't working.    This will be additionally complicated if someone else can claim either of you as a dependent.  I assume you're both out of the house, on your own?    You could go to a relative who knows money well, or an accountant, for advice.  But if you don't want to fuss with that, just put '1' for allowances, and if you get a large refund this year, tweak the number up.    EDIT: that Smart guy above has better advice.  Listen to him.

Thats ads from yahoo publishers network, anybody can put those ads on their site and if yahoo is making money off the ads on here, you know its possible to make money from those ads on any website that gets visitors. I have those ads on a few of my sites and I get paid about .20 cents for every click I get. I send thousands of people a day to my sites using youtube videos. I set up different youtube accounts for different types of videos. Even ebay has an affiliate program, go down to the bottom of the ebay screen where it says "affiliates" in small blue letters and check that out. You said "If it was possible, everybody would be doing it". Well millions of people are. Just look at any popular blogs or videos on youtube, those people arent making videos everyday or blogging just for the fun of it. Look at these spammers on here promoting their own websites. You better believe they are making money or else they wouldnt be doing it. Everybody doesn't make money on the computer because most people are stupid and too lazy to set up a website, they are too stupid to do things on their own, but yet they go to 9 to 5 jobs everyday while I sit home, mainly because they are like children who need instruction, they need someone to tell them what to do every hour or else they become unmotivated. I could sit there and show someone how to make money online, but if I left those people alone to do the work on their own at home, they would just get bored and turn on the TV. They need that instruction or authority over them. Most people are like this, I've explained tons of ways to make money, real legit ways, and made a site explaining it, while Im making money off the ads on the side. Majority of people who go to my site click the ads and dont even read my information, probably because reading a paragraph or article is too much work for them. So they are lazy and do what lazy people do, avoid work and look for "easy money", so they see the ads on my site that say stuff like "make a million dollars in one week" and stupidly, they click on those ads because my site offers legit ways to make money which involve WORK (as you mentioned) and their sites claim that they can become rich doing practically nothing. The lazy sheep will always choose the second option. I dont mind making money from these lazy people, but its them who are scamming me. I spent alot of time trying to help people with the info, and nobody thanks me or even reads the articles, so let them click on the ads and I can make my money and they can get scammed by whoever paid for the ads. They deserve it for being that lazy and stupid.|`|SvdFzKs4aa	scam|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Everything you see on line (and from previous answers here) is a scam. If anyone with a laptop could just work from home and make good money, wouldn't everyone be doing it?      Don't get me wrong, there are real jobs out there that do allow you to work from home but you need to actually apply for these jobs. You know, send in a resume and interview --the whole deal. If that's the way you want to go you should check out Monster for job openings.      As for all these make money quick websites-- they are all scams. Be prepared to waste your time and money if you try these things out. Remember though........ I warned you.      The only real places to make money on your own are websites where you can sell things such as Craigslist and Ebay. I would suggest investing in a book that will teach you how to start an Ebay business. This can be profitable but is also a TON of work. Don't for a second think your just going to bang on your keyboard and be making bank. You will really need to invest yourself in your business.

AA10368727	If your two young sisters are under the age of 19 (or under 24 if they're full time students), AND you can document that you provided more than one-half of their support, AND your sisters lived with you for more than half the year, AND no one else can legally claim them (because no one else provided more than half their support), then you should go ahead and claim them on your tax return as well.    It may raise a red flag, and the IRS may decide to ask both you and your stepfather about who provided the support, but it sounds like you have the tax code on YOUR side, according to IRS Publication 501.  If your stepfather claimed them and he did NOT meet all the requirements for claiming them, he can get into some big trouble with the IRS.    EDIT: The test for qualifying child is different than the test for qualifying relative.  It turns out that if your sisters did not provide more than half of their own support, your stepfather CAN, in fact, claim HIS daughter anyway.  Under the IRS tiebreaker rules (table 6 in publication 501), he'll "win" on the daughter for which he is the parent, but you'll "win" on the other sister because you have a higher AGI than your stepdad.    So, you can claim the sister that is NOT his actual daughter, but the one who IS his actual daughter can be claimed by him.  I would advise you to file an exemption for the one sister for which you're entitled to.|`|AA11284831	You probably can claim your sisters under the Qualifying Child rule as long as you all lived in the same household for more than half of the year.  Your stepfather cannot claim them unless your mother gave him a completed Form 8332 to file with his return.    You must now file a paper return by mail.  The IRS will then contact both you and the other party and ask you to prove your claims.  Assuming that you win, and you should, they will process your return with the exemptions and issue you your refund.  They will bill your stepfather for any tax that he owes due to the loss of the exemptions.    The process will delay your refund for 2 or 3 months though.  Unfortunately there's not a lot that you can do to expedite that aside from responding to the IRS letters immediately when they arrive.    "Scotty Doesn't Know" lives up to his name.  The support test is that your siblings did not provide more than half of their OWN support.  You will NOT have to prove that you provided more than half of their support.  Nor will the amount that your stepfather provided matter.  Without a court order granting him the exemption or a Form 8332 from your mother, his claim WILL be denied.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	I don't think there is any recourse you have as you are not the girls legal guardian. Your mother may have some way to collect the back child support form him and should contact the local district attorney. She may be able to collect it from his tax returns. And she should also have it put into writing by a court that he can't claim them as dependents so it doesn't happen again.|`|AA10469473	Did your stepfather live in the same household with your sisters for over 6 months during 2008?  If so, he has a legal right to claim them, and your mom can't give you permission.  For tax purposes a step parent is the same as a parent, and the parent's right to claim children always takes precedence over anyone else's.  He doesn't need your mom's permission.    No, there's no recourse - you didn't have the right to claim them if he did, if he lived with them for over half the year.    If he did NOT live with them though for over half the year, then you can claim them if you did live with them, and your mom doesn't claim them and doesn't give him a form 8332.|`|AA11828439	You can not claim them, even with your mother's permission.

If you feel you can afford it and both you and your partner (if you are buying with someone and not with yourself) have stable jobs then yes go for it. Don't buy it to flip it though, since markets will prob stay low for a while (what I mean is that I don't think by next year you can sell and make a huge profit). You should buy to live in it for a while.   Also don't overextend yourself by buying a house that takes up 80% of your pay since you need $$ to live on as well. Good luck hunting!

KjWq21eJaa	I purchased my home 5 years ago, I wish that I had waited until now. It is a very good time to buy a home. After a financial crisis occurs the market always rebounds. Simply put the market always gets back strong after a recession. If you buy a home now. The houses are under valued; therefore, you will be purchasing with equity from day 1 depending on the price. You may use that equity as a line of credit for home improvement, college fund, paying bills, or to meet any of your needs. The other option is you may wait until the market fully recovers and sell at a handsome profit. Yaay!! for you this is a big step. Good Luck.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	buy now|`|AA10348091	well right now houses are extremely so if you dont have a home of your own that your planning on selling GO FOR IT house prices  go up and down all the time but right now they are at an extremely low time since the economy is so bad so id say dont wait unless you want to lose money good luck|`|FTnuU4Ntaa	Now is an absolutely great time to buy.  Your realtor should and will advise you on the process as you go along.  Do not be afraid to ask questions of your realtor if you do not understand a particular process.  In this current market, sellers are paying closing costs and so you may not need as much money upfront as the bank is telling you.  If you do not hear from the lender, contact him/her and let them know you want information.  Do not be afraid to assert yourself as this is a major purchase.    Good luck.
mMPZuR7taa	Those who get assistace are not completely out of the woods. They get to keep their homes, but their credit ratings take a hit.    To even qualify, you must be 90+ days delinquent. The risky part is, if you try to do this intentionally (don't pay for three months) and do not qualify, you could lose your home.    I've considered this to be not a great policy myself, since some people will always learn to manipulate the system, but after looking at some of the specifics - it doesn't seem as bad as I originally thought. I figure a handful of people will get away with something anyway|`|fe8RxYsfaa	No, you and I get nothing.  We just keep forking over dollars to give to the irresponsible people in society.  It sucks.|`|s80gQDmvaa	Yeah, it does suck, big time. I understand that it's really helping the banks out by preventing those people from defaulting on their mortgages and more houses that can't be liquidated going back to the banks and tying up their funds so they can't lend. It's just unfortunate that honest people who didn't willfully buy houses they couldn't afford get the short end of the stick.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	that Federer is such a great guy|`|DOgW8MHCaa	the FED helping? yeah right they just doubled our money supply in 1 year.

x2hW0tqraa	most of positions require you to be 18...sometimes if you are 16 or 17 and just pushing carts, you might be hired (but there are many state and local laws that limit hours/job responsibilities and with applicants and the economy, given that both applicants are equally qualified, the one who is legally able to be more flexible in hours and can be around operating equipment, would tend to get the nod).  May I suggest other possibilities (you may tired of people making these suggestions, but these are real facts that may help you reach your goal of earning money) such as newspaper delivery; start your own dog walking service; shovel snow; help with yard clean up..I am glad that you want to make your own money and want to start getting away from Bank of Parents|`|LgZZ46tTaa	you have to be 18 sorry...

FTnuU4Ntaa	You get what you pay for.  In light of the current market, you want an agent that is going to adequately market your property so that it gets the best offer.  Also, the realtor is one part of the equation the other is the price you have in your head to sell.  You have to listen to your realtor in what your market/subdivision is doing so that you do not overprice yourself and get no buyers to look at your property.  In a market such as this, the buyer set the price.    Good luck

I live in a state with no income tax but since your husband earned in different states which probably do have state taxes I would get some help.  Look up any local accountants and see if they could do it.  H & R Block is ok but they will charge you fairly high fees.  Just make sure you get with someone that will e-file for you.

It insures your life only for the benefit of your next of kin. If you cancel it you do not get any money back. Basically if you do not have any dependants there is no point to it.|`|y2ZukikXaa	It means if you cancel the policy you'll no longer owe premiums, but you're not getting anything back.
9FxR4khCaa	It's best to set up a verification sheet that has the pt's insurance name, id 's, contact phone   (usualy found on the patients insurance card), who you spoke with there, effective date, co-pay amount (and if it's due for this type of visit) deductible (and amount met), co-insurance amount, out of pocket amount (and amount met). If pre-certification or authorization is needed for any procedures or diagnostic testing (this does not necessarily have to be done at the initial visit, only if a special test or procedure is ordered by the doctor.)Some insurance base this on the cost of the procedure (say over $1000) or if it's an out patient or in-patient procedure done in a hospital or out-patient surgery center. HMO's will almost always need prior auth from the pt's PCP.    That way, this verification can be saved in the patients chart as documentation if any questions arise later.

Get on to your local Tax Office and ask them to check if your Tax coding is correct.

Also, these days you do not get tax rebates, except after retirement, your employer simply stops deducting tax up to the amount of rebate that you are due.
AA11988604	No, you won't go to jail.  They might sue for any rent you still owe through the end of your lease and get a judgment against you.  that will affect your credit.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	the landlord can sue you for the 6 months unpaid rent|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If they want to get nasty about it, they can try to sue you for all of the money that you would have paid throughout the lease term to rent the apartment. They can also report you to the credit reporting bureaus for non-payment of rent. If that does turn up on your credit report, good luck finding another place to rent.    If you had a deposit with them, they may have just applied that to the last 30 days you would have been liable for and just rented the place out to someone else.
UeLigNB0aa	Well he was right about the commission. Per lender guide lines you must have a 2 year history of earning overtime, bonus, commission in order to count that income in your debt ratio. In some cases an underwriter may give you a break if you are close to a full 2 years.     I would recommend that you work with a different lender, there is no reason not to get you prequalified for a loan amount upfront.|`|9fed39238f286d3cd62baeb926026293aa	From my understanding everywhere wants a steady 2 year work history without switching jobs, nd as for getting pre- qualified that is basically worth the paper it is wrote on, you want to be pre-approved. I wouldnt do ANYTHING until you are pre approved, in fact most real estate agents wont even show you a house until you are pre approved and they sure wont let you but an offer in on one. Try to find another lending company. Good Luck
HZtgNnfPaa	my senior class is doing a fund raiser to go to florida in the spring. what were doing is kinda like dancing with the stars, but were calling it "dancing with the staff" we all thought it was really clever, and would get alot of laughs. Basically a student picks their favorite teacher to preform a dance with. you pick your music and come up with a routine. then you preform infront of a "panel of judges" 2 staff and 2 students. they vote on who did the best. i hope its going to be really awesome. but if you charge like 5 dollars a ticket, you'll be sure to get alot of cash. i mean who doesn't want to see their teachers make fools of themselves. glad to help!
NncP5z24aa	I called and talked to a rep after being on hold for an hour...hope this helps.    It's a glitch. A few people have received their refunds, however most, have not. A few banks approved the funds before the federal reserve actually released them. They are scheduled to actually transmit the "OK to release" on Thursday night/Friday morning, at midnight. Most people that had their tax return accepted by 11am on the 21st, will be receiving their refunds on Friday. Don't panic. Only a few more days.|`|07D0cj3Laa	Check out the other posts...It appears that there are some issues with the website...but everyone is stating that you should recieve this as per the schedule|`|AA10468143	Yes its happening to lots of us.

Thats what happen to us last year.
t57Gp7MEaa	Did they provide any reference code? If so, my experience with that situation has been nothing but bad and the IRS tends to give you the run-a-round.     When I checked my status a few days ago, it stated that I should receive my refund by February 3rd. However, it now says that there was a delay and I should receive it by February 24th. This is supposedly from a glitch and the refunds are still scheduled for their original DD date.|`|NncP5z24aa	I called and talked to a rep after being on hold for an hour...hope this helps.

AA11206283	Tax assessor for the county probably has the footage online free.    Try there|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You could offer to rent it with the condition it the size represented and then measure it yourself.  Keep in mind many areas calculate living area measure to the outside walls.  Yes, it's area you're not getting but that's the way it's done.  You might check with the tax assessors office.  They will probably have the gross building area and then just divide by the number of units.    realtor.sailor|`|panDJIGcaa	you could look online and see if there any places on sale where you live at and low priced|`|Gun3UGzaaa	If it is a condo/coop then the real estate assessment for that unit should have the internal square footage.  Otherwise, you could have the broker go over and take measurements and calculate it for you.    If you haven't seen the apt yet, bring a tape measure when you go and measure it.    Final option: Have him prepare and sign a statement of the dimensions and rooms in the apartment and append it to the contract, so it will give you grounds to dispute it and sue him if he lied.

You filed partial year resident returns for Mississippi and Indiana.|`|x6wsmJQGaa	Yes you send both.|`|6Cp41lb6aa	It depends.    In Mississippi, if your only Mississippi-source income is from their casinos, you don't have to file Mississippi state taxes at all.  (At least, that's how it was in 2003, you may want to read up)
AA11284831	C'mon!  The IRS would never have told you that the tax person must have "done a freud" or told you that it would be up to her to "cancel the tax transaction."  The IRS does not make unfounded accusations about tax preparers, nor is it possible to cancel a tax transaction.  They would have explained the error that caused your refund to be less than what was claimed on your return and would have told you to file an amended return if a correctable error had been made on your end.    So, now that we know that you made this all up about your conversation with the IRS, how about putting the REAL story here with full details?  And since the IRS hasn't sent out any refunds yet, your entire post smells like BS.  Go ahead and prove me wrong but I'm not swallowing a word of what you're saying so far!|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	If your tax preparer is a CPA, you can file a complaint with the State Board of Accountany.  They take ANY claims of fraud VERY seriously.  If she is not a CPA.....try Judge Judy!
4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	That's a question for a Cetified Public Accountant.  But, if you made less than $600 in cash, according to the IRS, you are not required to report it.  It's nice to see you are trying to do the honest thing, but your former employer, in business or not, is LEGALLY required to provide you with a W2 by January 31st of the following year.
