This is clearly anomalous and against the prevailing pattern. This would be the first time in the history of Earth when the temperatures do not agree with Milankovitch predictions.

I'll run water pipes through the concrete to get hot water for household use and to heat my house in the winter.   I could also boil an alcohol mixture with the heat and turn a steam turbine with it to produce my electricity.     This could be done at military bases with little fear of "the terrorists" getting their hands on the stuff.

Less energy of any kind, and less unnecessary products and convenience items that require energy to manufacture and transport to consumers. <br>  I am installing PV solar, and use crude geothermal to cool and store some of my food. <br>  I am in favor of using solar as a first solution as it produces power during daylight hours when it can peak shave, instead of wind (for now) that produces it around the clock when the demand is not there. When a full compliment of solar is online, then we should move to wind.|`|75df635938894745156b654c93159941aa	Nuclear - it has been  cleanest, safest, most robust source of energy for a while now<br>  And before linking me to that report, remember that to calculate pollution effect it assumed catastrophes exceeding Chernobyl will take place every now and then, which they, well, don't, especially with improved tech.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	It's a combination we have to find that works.  Each has pros and cons and are better suited for some things and not so great for others.<br>  <br>  I do however have a suggestion that would make a big improvement on our environment: cities and urban areas need to ditch cars altogether for getting around and opt for other modes of transportation such as golf cart type mobiles, even horse and carriages.  There's no need for speed really, and no need for lots of storage space (large autos), just getting around town in close perimeters.  It would make traffic move more smoothly, too!  And better parking!  Less smog, you name it.  They already do this in some remote areas such as tiny islands that don't allow cars and they get around in golf carts. Why not cities?|`|4e4dddc4fa525276812e1a5cfcd459c7aa	i live in Hawaii, we have solar on all state (i think) buildings. also we are looking into wave energy as well.

AA10755943	Psedomonas syringae - at the heart of snowflakes and possibly raindrops, causes water to accumulate around itself causing precipitation. This is probably the most significant climatic bacterium.<br>  <br>  Also, the bacteria that decay organic matter release its Carbon back into the atmosphere as CO2. That becomes food for new growing plants that provide food for animals, completing the life cycle.

b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	If you are speaking of the steel angle lattice towers, they are laid into the ground on concrete piers or timbers, and built from the ground up in sections, then hoisted by cranes (or gin booms in older times). Taller ones can be have their sections stacked by helicopter. <br>  Insulators are hung and sheaves (pulleys) are connected to the ends. A small (or series of small to large) ropes are pulled through the sheave blocks until a rope of sufficient size is used to pull the conductor through the sheaves using a machine called a Puller / Tensioner. It is a giant winch that uses cable reels instead of it's own drum. The machines are used in tandem, one to pull in the rope on an empty drum, another to pay off the conductor. The puller "pulls", and the pay off machine releases the wire under a drag to keep it tight "tensioning". When it is in place and splices have been made, the puller continues for a short time and the proper tension or "sag" is established in the line. This is calculated to take into account the expansion and contraction of the wire due the heat of the air and the amperage running through it. The sheaves are replaced by permanent connections to the insulators. The whole system is then tested for ampacity and insulation prior to bringing online with the grid. The line will be brought up to voltage and flown by helicopter with infrared imaging equipment to check for hot spots and leakage as well. The industry is moving away from lattice towers and installing wood pole, or steel tube frames now. Wood is mostly set into the ground with a device called a digger/ derrick, and steel is erected with a crane. With the use of more machinery they are easier to erect, and there is a limited need to climb them as they can be reached for service with aerial (bucket ) trucks and cranes with hanging baskets to maintain them. I had the opportunity to work on one of the oldest transmission lines in the country (1895) and they used three legged Aeromotor (farm type) windmill towers to support the wire, as their was no ready made equipment at the time. <br>  The wire used to be copper and is now primarily Aluminum. Common names are "Copperweld" and "ACSR" (Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced). Both use an internal steel messanger to add strength. smaller sire sizes use American Wire Gauge (AWG) numbers, and the smaller # means a larger size. they go up (but seems like down) to 0000 (4 ought). As they get larger in diameter they use the actual cross sectional area of the wire as a name. Such as 250, 336, or 750 kCM (thousand Circular Mils).

Tree Top Apple Juice is preferred, or equal in shape.<br>  <br>  One empty plastic ? gallon container.  Langers All Pomergranate Juice is preferred or equal.<br>  <br>  Directions:  Lay the plastic gallon container on its side so the front label is facing up.  Place the empty plastic half gallon container on the label and with a sharpie pen outline the bottom on the Tree Top label and with a sharp knife carefully cut the outline.  Insert the half gallon into the hole until it rest on the back label of the gallon container.  Then mark and cut approximately one inch above the cut on the ? gallon  to complete your planter container.  Remove and drill several ? inch holes on the bottom of the ? gallon cut container for drainage. <br>  <br>  Fill the cut ? gallon planter with one inch of gravel before putting in good potting mix soil and live growing plant.  If you make two or more you can pour the water back and forth and not waste the water with the nutrients.<br>  <br>  Go to NASA’s Clean Air Plant Study for the top ten plants that cleans the indoor air better than the rest.   <a href="http://www.zone10.com/tech/NASA/Fyh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zone10.com/tech/NASA/Fyh.htm</a><br>  <br>  Hope you like it.|`|D9A9y42yaa	Oh goodness, there are so many things to do to reuse ( recycle). Try using the egg carton as a seeding tray. Use the unused egg carton by filling  up ea. individual pocket with some soil, putting a seed in and watering. Better than buying from the store and cheaper. so not only is it cost effective, but you help the environment by not buying more plastic pots that are just going to find their way to the landfill! <br>  Let's see... plastic bottles can be used in the same way, except you can make an art project out of them by cutting off the tops and decorating the outside!!! Present that as an environmental project for the younger classes!! Cardboard can be put together in any shape you wish for a younger sibling as an inside fort and decorated, when they are done destroying it, cut it up and use it for other projects, like a puppet play stage- kids love the simplest things!! It definately gets its use and when done, recycle. Newspaper can be cut up into strips and given to the ART department of your school for a paper mache project. Take old broken glass pieces and set them in concrete ( no sharp edges sticking out) for walking stones in the yard. Functional and pretty!! Old sheets can be made into curtains/drapes, maybe even a shower curtain cover-up. be creative, there are so many little things that can be reused to lower the amount of things going into landfills!!|`|AA11214072	With the permission of your Principal and consent of your teacher you can :<br>  (A) Paper Recycling project:<br>  (1) Place bins in classes to collect  used or waste stationary  like copies, loose sheets etc.<br>  (2) This can be given to an agency/supplier for recycling of used paper .<br>  Since the agency can collect large quantity at one point they would be glad to pay back some money which could be pooled to defray cost of bins etc.<br>  This way students would not only get rid of waste paper they would also free the space used by "waste" in their homes. This way their parents would also be happy.<br>  Similarly you can have used battery/cells recycled and other daily use items like tooth past tubes/ shaving crème tubes, cosmetics tubes to recover metals like aluminum (recycled)|`|72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	Some of the things I recycle daily are as follows:  I am a foster Mom with special needs children, so we go through LOTS of medicine, unfortunately, we also have lots of those plastic containers!  I now use them for the Craft Room, for holding beads, small clippings for scrapbooking, for holding paint, a few paperclips for my purse, my magazine bag and my coupon bag, you name it, they come in handy for stuff.  We recycle newspaper, making paper mache projects, wrapping delicate items for storage, making paper logs for the chiminea and taking to the recycling center.  We also recycle glass, plastic and aluminum cans.  We recycle boxes from Sams for storage, carrying items, and packing up what we are Freecycling, and craigslisting.  We use and re-use cloth bags for shopping, and we use our food waste, peelings and non-meat leftovers for the compost.  I also am a Master Gardener, so I share my extra plants with others and also get to share in their extras at 2 annual Plant Swaps held yearly.  I love recycling things I cannot use, I love getting things I can use, and most of all, I love the idea that someone elses trash is a treasure and can be put to more uses before being set to the curb, ditto for my leftovers too!  These are the simple things we can do daily, that really take a MINIMAL effort, and can have the impact of saving us lots more room in landfills.  After all, why waste not only precious resources, but things that are easily used for other things?  Its required a little bit of effort on my part, and really, truthfully, is now second nature to me, so I don't feel that it is ANY imposition on me!  Hopefully, you can come up with some great ideas for your school project, probably an easy one to do that will create some beautiful objects d art, would be recycling newspaper into paper mache art projects!  Also, newspaper can be used in composting too!  Good luck and I think this is a great idea for kids to be doing!
15tuuFtfaa	I had the same problem while working in a Ford factory a few years ago. My credit cards were getting demagnetized on a daily basis. Turns out sometimes heavy machinery emits electromagnetic bursts that can demagnetize cards and such if they are not properly protected. Some things you can do about this problem include purchasing an "demagnetization safe wallet." You can get these wallets online ( just google it). A cheaper and equally effective method of protecting your things is to wrap the cards in aluminum foil. It may be a bit of an inconvenience but is certainly a lesser one than having to replace your credit and id cards. Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  TS|`|Up3euVbLaa	I'd have to agree with the previous answer - wrapping my important cards in tin foil immediately ended my demagnetization frustration! It is by far the most practical (and cost effective) to protect your cards.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Helen
