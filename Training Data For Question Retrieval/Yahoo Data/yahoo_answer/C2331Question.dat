20090426081129AAEv9oH	Education & Reference;Teaching	Do gym and art teachers get paid the same amount as regular teachers?	I got done observing for several weeks in an elementary and a high school and across the board, the gym, art etc. etc. teachers don't do all that much and tend to leave the children to do as they feel, whereas, the regular teachers have to plan extensive lessons and are responsible for preparing students for the standardized tests...       So the question is, suppose you have a teacher with a masters in art and one with a masters in like science or math or history etc, both first year at the same school, do they get the same pay? It doesn't really seem fair. Arguably the degree was harder for the real teacher and much more work and responsibility is involved. The art and gym teachers I saw seemed to plan their lessons on the fly.

And I need help on deciding which support thesis to write about.      My main thesis is:   "In John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men, he shows that true friendship involves friends looking out for one another even when difficult decisions must be made that change the course of one’s plans."      The two support theses I've created are:   "The goal to reach the American Dream in Of Mice and Men is set as unattainable due to commitments of friendship and genetic or acquired limitations that change the path of one’s plans."   "Steinbeck uses George’s sacrifice of killing Lennie to illustrate the ultimate commitment of friendship which destroys one’s future plans."      >remember, a support thesis should be very closely related to the main thesis.

20090222120310AAWRuMV	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you give any kind of suggestion on this paper what grade should i get if i turned the paper(A,B,..)?	Personal Development Essay       For this year I have planned to get any kind of help that I can to build my personal strength and avoid being victim all the time. My personal development and success I want to have in college have been hold back by lack of confidence, negative image I have created to my self.    My luck of confidence have made me unable to see my self clearly, let people decide for my future, and being scared to express my feeling. Secondly I have also created   a very big negative image toward my self. I have always told my self that everything I do is wrong, I do what people say so that they will be happy, I never express my feeling because I thought I will be selfish  and every time I do some think wrong I do  hate that  I am alive, I never do something bad that will make everyone mad because my religion is strong and my family are very strict we can not respond any thing to our parents  or others but say yes to what they so when someone told me I have done a mistake I feel like I have done a big mistake that I was not suppose to do and then I will start to say why do I need to alive  if I can not do every think right why should I make every one mad , that’s way I hate that I am alive. And if I did some thing  wrong the solution my mind always brought is to kill my self , I do mostly take 4 different kinds of medicine I got around me so that it can kill me I do this when I  always got mad and when peoples face changed it does not have to be because of me but my mind makes me think that they got mad or sad because of me. And this has brought a negative effect on my relationship to my personal development because I am not trying to find solution for mistake I have done but act as a victim and instead of seeking help I am referring to die because that’s what I used to thought as a short path . But none of this helped me they make me to be scared every move I do and hate my self instead of increasing my personal development.    There fore I want to make an important personal goal because the thoughts I used to have they  made me  depressed person,  not have fun with people by open up and tell my feeling because I am always scared to hear there respond, not do thinks I like freely, and be shy. So for this year I want to be a confidence,   not be scared to tell what I fell inside, admire who I am and be creator no more victim, I want to have a fresh life I do not want any think to do that is going to make my lord mad anymore . To achieve this goal I  will try to talk to peoples in confidence and show who I am with out being scared what will happen next, do decision to my life by myself no more asking people what should I do and also be happy on things I got. The benefit and reward I will have from this change is freedom, This is what I have missed from my life for 2 years  I want to be free and be happy I do not want to get mad , cry the all night and hate that I am alive.    These two are the basic challenge that I have faced and still did not get a solution but now when I attend in this class I start believing I can do anything and I want to get rid of this two behaviors from my life and be a free person, have a good attitude toward my future, and love life no matter what happen good or bad.

20090222112955AAqoGzs	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone proofread this quick?	In the past I have exerted much of my negative energy into unusual, and not-like me actions.  This as you know has resulted in my bad behaviors, which is dis-respectful, uncaring, irresponsible, and the list goes on. Yes I do have explanations and ways to explain the situation, but that's besides the point. The point is that I'm capable of ways to prevent these situations from happening. Every time it seems that I have a new excuse someone else to blame. Up until now I have not really taken constructive criticism constructively. To me its been hard listening to people that just point out all your flaws. What I now understand is that I just need to take the advice and learn from it. If not now then when will I ever learn?          I have upon recently figured out who the person is that is destroying my life.  Just causing me all this pain and ill will that has been resulting in my head hanging low. It's like this person is inside my head controlling all my actions, making throw in the towel, and giving up. That person was this negative energy in me that wasn't allowing me to put in all my best effort, half *** work that no one benefit ted from.  This person everyone saw was me I was in complete and total control of my actions, but it was this negative energy inside me that made it so i was not able to think through my thoughts. With this I was fishing in the mouth of Poseidon. Meaning I was asking for a beating, cruising for a bruising.        If I could say anything about my family it would be that no matter what they are always there for me, helping me out, and challenging me to meet my goals. My goals in life right now are to finish high school in the top of my class, and to succeeded in everything I put my all in.  This in the long run will put me in the right position to successfully enter a college or university of my choice.  The dream is to go to college and do great things. Daily I when I wake up I haft to choose to love myself or else I am giving up the right of myself to do my best.  With these daily routines, long-short term goals, and my dreams I will without a doubt create my own destiny and make sure its everything I want.        Life is hard enough and its even harder with no sense of direction.  The only way I can prevent these festivals of punishment is to work with my family as one, one team, one heart. Singly I am nothing, just a kid with ideas and no sense of direction, but together, together we all can accomplish great things. I am very superficial by myself, with the knowledge of us all we can find the deeper meaning. I very much look forward to these great things and WORKING TOGETHER with each other, sorting out all the problems we may face.

I asked a question yesterday, in the Parenting category, that simply asked if the parents choose homeschool, private school or public school for their children.      Some answered appropriately, but some chose to make what we homeschoolers know is ignorant remarks about homeschooling-i.e. lack of socialization, not able to get help needed.  It drives me crazy!      I was not telling them why I think private and/or public school is bad.  And the opinions are so incorrect it is hilarious.  I just wished people knew what homeschooling really is, and how mainstream it is becoming!      Do you run into these kinds of assumptions often, either in real life or online?

20090222174526AAwrc2j	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How do convince my parents to let me go to the university of michigan or how to pay myself?	I'm a senior in hs and got in, but because of some trouble i got into over the summer my parents are reconsidering whether or not i am responsible enough.      They know the prestige of the school and what a great opportunity it will be for me. And I've told them a million times how in love I am with the school and Ann Arbor. I've wanted to go to Mich my whole life. My grandpa, dad, uncle, aunt and a few cousins went there and I would die to carry on the tradition. I've seriously never wanted anything more in my whole life.       I'm out of state, so it will cost about $43k just for freshman year, I believe and my parents make too much money for me to qualify for fafsa, but they probably won't even be paying for it if I can't talk them into it. I may get some merit based scholarships, but my grades and test scores aren't that high. I've applied for a bunch of scholarships through my high school, but I'm sure I won't get enough to cover all the cost.       So basically more ways I can convince my parents to help or how I can pay for it myself without being in ridiculous debt when I graduate.      I'm open for almost any suggestions.
20090222171525AAgVx8u	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Can I Still Go Back to College?	I am currently on an "Unemployment Deferment" because I became unemployed in Dec. '08 - and the first expiration rolls in August of this year (2009).      I've been out of college for over a year due to family medical setbacks and when I first transferred to my community college from the private college I was attending for nearly 4 years, upon transferring I did not perform well at all academically during the first semester.      I was not informed well at all as to what to do nor what were my options because of my poor performance. The only things I got of of it and was told is that: I had to submit a letter explaining why I didn't do well or wait out...and that is pretty much it, I honestly do not remember much else.      I have been out of college for too long: I have 80+ credits under my belt from my years attended at private college and I need to go back to finish this once and for all.       I know I've matched and already taken the basics - but this deferment on my student loan right now really has me second guessing everything.      I do not want to stay out for a few years repaying when I know for a fact with what is going on in the world, as of now finding a job is really slim and not in my favor.      I am curious: could I get an "In-School Deferment" and/or switch/change from the current "Unemployment Deferment" and get back into college, finish, and graduate once and for all?      I'd really like to get back into things this Fall.      How do "In-School Deferments" work, and how does one qualify?      Or am I too late...? -__-

If i go to BCU i dont know what i would want to do really, I might become a counselor or a registered nurse. Either of those to will do. FHCHS is like an uptight school and i know if i go there ill be working and working. but BCU is more fun and laid back. kind of like a party college *but being the type of person i am, i WILL get my work done and accomplish being a nurse or a counselor*. All my life i've been cooped up in this country town i live in and i've never really had any fun. Thats why i want to go off to college to have fun BUT its also to accomplish something and to get my life started. My mother says college is supposed to be fun and i'm supposed to find myself.

20090222184420AA5ozRN	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help me analyze this poem by Shel Silverstein?	Can you help me identify any uses of literary devices( ex. figurative language, alliterations, allusions, rhythm, meter....) in this poem? I know that there's a rhyme scheme.      Cloony The Clown by Shel Silverstein      I'll tell you the story of Cloony the Clown   Who worked in a circus that came through town.   His shoes were too big and his hat was too small,   But he just wasn't, just wasn't funny at all.   He had a trombone to play loud silly tunes,   He had a green dog and a thousand balloons.   He was floppy and sloppy and skinny and tall,   But he just wasn't, just wasn't funny at all.   And every time he did a trick,   Everyone felt a little sick.   And every time he told a joke,   Folks sighed as if their hearts were broke.   And every time he lost a shoe,   Everyone looked awfully blue.   And every time he stood on his head,   Everyone screamed, "Go back to bed!"   And every time he made a leap,   Everybody fell asleep.   And every time he ate his tie,   Everyone began to cry.   And Cloony could not make any money   Simply because he was not funny.   One day he said, "I'll tell this town   How it feels to be an unfunny clown."   And he told them all why he looked so sad,   And he told them all why he felt so bad.   He told of Pain and Rain and Cold,   He told of Darkness in his soul,   And after he finished his tale of woe,   Did everyone cry? Oh no, no, no,   They laughed until they shook the trees   With "Hah-Hah-Hahs" and "Hee-Hee-Hees."   They laughed with howls and yowls and shrieks,   They laughed all day, they laughed all week,   They laughed until they had a fit,   They laughed until their jackets split.   The laughter spread for miles around   To every city, every town,   Over mountains, 'cross the sea,   From Saint Tropez to Mun San Nee.   And soon the whole world rang with laughter,   Lasting till forever after,   While Cloony stood in the circus tent,   With his head drooped low and his shoulders bent.   And he said,"THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT -   I'M FUNNY JUST BY ACCIDENT."   And while the world laughed outside.   Cloony the Clown sat down and cried.

So can anyone tell me what it's like? I know that my GPA isn't a sight to see, but I have  been told that I'm talented with poetry so that may have been the reason I was nominated. Are the exceptions to nominations because I really want to know why I was chosen.       Also, after the meetings and stuff, can you go out free to do something that isn't stupid? I'd like to shop a bit. In the dorms, is there cable and internet access, and would I be allowed to bring stuff like Game Boys, a Wii possibly, for entertainment for free time? (Do we have free time..?)       And also, I'm a girl, so can I hang out with boys during the free time? I heard that opposite genders can't be in single sex rooms, but I really want to make friends with people of both sexes.      Also, what percentage of people get into it? I doubt it's really low since I was nominated, but I'm curious.       Thanks for any help!
