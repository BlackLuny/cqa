20090222192148AAAWDsc	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	Style or period of artists from classic to early renaissance?	Taking an art history class and I'm horrible at telling the style or period of certain works. If anyone knows the name of the style of the following arts it would be greatly appreciated:   "Last Judgment" Giotto   "The Last Supper" Leonardo da Vinci   "Virgin and Saint Anne with the Christ Child" Leonardo da Vinci   "Christ Entering Jerusalem" Giotto   "Christ Entering Jerusalem" Duccio   "Exorcism of the Demons at Arezzo" Giotto   "Tribute Money" Masaccio   "Last Judgment" Gislebertus [I think this one's Romanesque]   "Trinity with Donors" Masaccio   "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione" Raphael   "Virgin and Child Enthroned" Giotto   "Virgin and Child Enthroned" Cimabue      or if anyone has any suggestions or tips on how I can figure out the period or style on my own...that would help even more =)

20090222192620AAeyzg4	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like my story?	D.A.N.C.E       “Hey Leah, I got to tell you something, wait up!”  My best friend Hannah shouted as she practically ran into the whole school, as only Hannah could. “What is something else wrong?” I snapped “I… uh” she stuttered “Don’t even bother I said as I sharply turned away. I never treated Hannah this way but today it didn’t matter. All that mattered to me was m and it would stay that way.    Beep beep! I smacked my alarm clock just milliseconds before it beeped again. Just another day in boring Norman, Oklahoma. I sluggishly stepped out of my soft, warm bed. I quickly searched for my soft fuzzy frog slippers as my feet hit the cold hard wood floors. “Leah are you awake yet?” my mom shouted “Yes mom” I tossed myself to the bathroom to brush my teeth. Two minutes, I stopped and quickly rushed over to my too small closet to find something to wear. I pulled out a faded denim mid-length skirt and a pale lavender long-sleeved sweater. Now the hard part, shoes. It was a miracle that I could find a pair that matched to wear every day. I hastily got on my knees and searched through the gigantic pile at the bottom of my closet lying before me. Within seconds I had found a pair of black flats with little black bows on top. “Wow it must be my lucky day” I said as I quickly got dressed. “C’mon Leah your gonna be late for school!” Mom shouted. I grabbed my bag and ran downstairs into the kitchen. “Good morning honey, do you want some breakfast mom said as she flipped a pancake onto a clean plate. “No, I’ll just eat a breakfast bar on the bus; I don’t want to be late to school” “again” me and mom said in unison. Honk honk! “There’s the bus gotta go, love you mom” I said as I gave her a quick peck on the cheek and dashed out the door and onto the bus.    I scanned the aisles for Hannah and quickly took a seat next to her. “Hey Leah!” Hannah said as she greeted me with a smile. “Hey Hannah, what’s up?” “Oh nothing much, did you finish the science homework? It was really…” And that was it, everyone quickly scrambled to get off the bus. As soon as we stepped off the bus I lost sight of Hannah in the crowd. I sighed, took a deep breath and I was on my way to history. History dragged on and on within five minutes I was doodling on my notes. There was very little social activities or things to look forward to and that’s when I got the idea. “A dance” I whispered to my self. There would be food, dancing and mus…  Ring! Thought interrupted; I quickly ran out of the history room and found Hannah. “Hannah I have the perfect idea!”  I said out of breath. “Well then tell me” “We should organize a dance!” “Are you crazy? Just the two of us?” “No silly, we could get a whole lot of people to help!” “Okay but I still don’t like the idea of it” weeks had passed and my excitement slowly faded away into a mere shimmer. No help at all, Hannah had all ready bailed out on me, but she was the one to help me organize my thoughts; to keep me from losing my head. “Hey Leah” Hannah said uneasily “what something else went wrong?” “Kinda” “What happened?” I spoke between clenched teeth “No decorations… sorry” Hannah whispered apologetically “Not your fault” I whispered back, my fists tightened.    Two weeks, three days, 14 hours and 12…10 seconds till the dance. If things didn’t start shaping up soon then this would be the worst school year ever! I had so many expectations and they could all come crashing down right before my eyes . I could barely concrete on what Mr. Roberts; our biology teacher was saying. All I could concrete on was the seconds ticking away that I couldn’t work on trying to pull off this dance. Ring! School was out. I swiftly but quietly made my way to the bus, and within minutes I was knocked out. “Leah, Leah wake up.” I felt a gentle nudge on my shoulder “Leah” I opened my eyes and blinked I saw Hannah, Sam ( the cutest guy ever!) and a few other friends hovering me. “You okay?” Sam asked with his gorgeous baby blue eyes and dirty blonde hair. “Yeah I’m fine just a little tired. I realized that this was my stop and got off the bus and quickly dashed into the house. “Hey Leah rough day at school?” mom said as she gave my shoulder a light squeeze. She like Hannah was ver. She like Hannah was very comforting “There is just so much to do mom. I mean I don’t have a theme, decorations, food and it doesn’t look like I’m gonna be able to get a DJ.” I said silent tears streaming down my face. “Well maybe a miracle will happen, just don’t worry”. Thank god it was Friday the weekend was here      ______________________________________...   thats all i got do you like it??

20090222171242AAhZbyT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Life approaches death?	when they know that an illness or some other condition is taking them closer to death people make peace with themselves and learn to accpet that they wont be on earth for too long.       could this be an evolutionary trait that we have inherited in order to survive and then when survival battle is lost we learn to adopt to the fact that life is limited and we must let go of it?      I have seen that even with animals. when they know that death is near they creep into a bush and silently remain there till they die      what do you think of this?

20090222180501AAt5lmB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you see any errors in this?	I recently wrote a bit of fan fiction that I need a few neutral and diverse opinions on, though I must warn you.      1. It is vaguely gory.   2. More than gory, it is very dark and quite morbid.  So if you don’t like those sorts of things, don’t read this.   3. Upside: other than corpses, this has no other adult content.      Please find any errors, spelling or if you see anything in this that breaks the rules of creative writing pleas tell me.      Disclaimer: This is fan fiction so I must credit Fire Emblem and Nintendo the characters in this are from them, not me.       The small town lay in ruins. All of its defenses, despite being perfected over generations, lay shattered like frail glass. The town gate hung open, with its brace on the floor in two pieces, shattered by a strange bolt of force. The buildings appeared ransacked by thieves willing to take advantage of any chaos. Despite the warm summer night, unnatural frost clung to the walls and street, lightly covering the many frozen bodies.    To any who looked, the story told itself clearly. A force entered through one of the side entrances where the gate hung open uselessly; there, the assault began. There, more than anywhere else, laid the icy bodies of soldiers, devoid of life completely. Strewn in numerous positions, some with swords drawn who fell in mid-stride as they ran; others backed up against a wall, arms wrapped around themselves who, in vain, tried to shield themselves against the cold of the attacks. Still, others tossed by strange powerful winds, lying in awkward positions, already dead on impact.    Still, some tracks lead away from the battle; clearly the attacking force felt no need to chase those who already yielded to its power. Past the gate, the assault continued. Though the village did seem prepared, its defenses simply stood no chance.    A few mutilated bodies of soldiers lay at the bases of the towers, marked by strange burns, like those of lightning. Further in, the frozen remnants of the second line of the town’s defense sat broken and undone.    Heavily armored knights lay frozen in their armor, motionless and far from the clear field of battle. While the knights clearly never even came close enough deal any blows, several young men lay in the direct path of the assault swords drawn and ready to attack.    Next came the cavalry; though the tracks that went to the battle formed ranks many left the battle, on clearly panicked horses. Unable to understand what the saw, the improvised war horses clearly ran in terror, as they saw the strange force dispatch one after another of the town’s defenses in a wave of un natural chill.    The few, who rallied bravely for the attack, did so in vain. Like those outside their bodies lay in strange awkward positions after being tossed from their horses by powerful winds. Only one horse lay dead among them, with its rider still in its saddle.    This one lay far from the battle, clearly charging in for an attack; but rather than be frozen the man lay mildly burned much like the archers by the towers. Both he and his horse bore clear evidence of the electrical shock that took their lives. Next to them, lay the remains of a strange book, torn apart in a strange way.    Its pages fluttered on the ground in the light wind, burned slightly, just like the soldier. The leather binding appeared dry and cracked, as if from the inside strained them in an attempt to get out.    Further in, men with axes and knives ran through the town, taking what they pleased, with none left to stop them, though they had not been the ones to make the assault. Though they now seemed to rule the town, without question, they still feared to approach the center of the town, where the attacking force now stood.    There, in the center of the town, two figures stood; the first: an old man. Though grey with age he still stepped with as much agility as any young soldier, but with far more skill. With his powerful arms, the man carried a massive axe. He wore no armor, only a pair of shorts leaving his chest bare, and around his neck, a string of bizarre symbols.    The other figure stood at the opposite side of the battle field. With its slight form and pail skin it did not seem to be a warrior. Also, instead of armor, the creature wore a strange, elaborate, uniform. White slakes, with polished black boots, perfectly reflecting the sun light. For its chest, the creature wore simple white shirt, and an elegant black vest with a red collar and gold linings and tails reaching down to the top of the creature’s boots.    The creature’s ebony black hair reached completely down its back in. Strait but with corpse, the hair displayed no signs of the surrounding battle. On its head the figure wore a small gold ring, plane, though decorative.    In its hands, the creature carried a strange book, much like the one by the soldier on the horse, but still intact. The creature seemed unprepared to fight, standing armed only with a book, though it stared its op

20090222174639AADrqXj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help with Lord of the Flies ending?	I just finished reading Lord of the Flies by William Golding 5 seconds ago and its driving me crazy. The ending paragraph got me confused. It says:      The officer, surrounded by these noises, was moved and a little embarrassed. He turned away to give them time to pull themselves together; and waited, allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.      OK, so my question is: when they say in the distance, did the boat float away or...... did they get rescued? It's killing me because I just finished it and it was great, i just have to know.... please help me!!!

I'm noticing a lot of my fellow petsite artists use Flash to draw their pets, and the end result is a nice, crisp look. I'd like some tips for creating pictures with it, tips aimed at someone who is already quite skilled with Photoshop.         This is a recent pet from Chibipaws that I made. It's pretty nice, I think, but only because I spent awhile tweaking the layers with the sharpen tool and others once I had it all coloured...  http://fc14.deviantart.com/fs41/f/2009/0...  I'm hoping the nice crispness of Flash will make this easier for me.

Thanks          Mother to Son               Well, son, I'll tell you:   Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.   It's had tacks in it,   And splinters,   And boards torn up,   And places with no carpet on the floor—   Bare.   But all the time    I'se been a-climbin' on,   And reachin' landin's,   And turnin' corners,   And sometimes goin' in the dark   Where there ain't been no light.   So, boy, don't you turn back.   Don't you set down on the steps.   'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.   Don't you fall now—   For I'se still goin', honey,   I'se still climbin',   And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

I literally have not written a line of it since eighth grade, but now I find myself actually needing it. It plays an important part in a children's story I'm writing for class, because I need a curse that rhymes. (Fairy tale style, not anything too horrid.) I can get the rhythm in my head easily enough, but I feel ridiculous whenever I write the words because it sounds bad. But if I had a beginning, I think I could get the rest.      So, can you help me begin, or at least give advice? Please?      Here's the basic idea:      Antagonist falls into lust with Protagonist's sister, but she scorns his advances, making fun of him until he snaps and curses her. The curse makes her insubstantial, untouchable, and frozen in terms of both time and movement, so that she will be living a half life, aware but unable to do anything as everyone around her grows old and dies.      I know it's silly, but I'm writing this mostly for myself, and dearly want to finish it. So, could you please help?      Thank you. =)

Be brutally honest... is this any good?          A piece of history, so small, yet so relevant. Pick it up, run your fingers over it's smooth surface. The only blemish? A crack, splitting it almost directly in half. Replaying eternally the pain and sorrow of 11 million. A representation of it's time, a generation, cut in two.         Simply a bust, made of solid wood.  Almost as dark as ebony.  A face carved into it.  "At least 96 Jews were killed and hundreds more injured, more than 1000 synagogues were burned, hundreds of Jewish cemeteries and schools were damaged, and almost 7500 Jewish businesses were vandalized and looted -- including the [-----]s' grocery store."

20090222185037AAg3hi5	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you have to say about nobody (Negative Existentials)?	When a friend first presented this paradox to me, I was a bit dumbfounded myself, and it's a particular favorite of mine. Let's take this statement as an example: "Unicorns do not exist." Now consider the following: If the above statement is about any particular thing, then it is indeed about a unicorn. Therefore, in some form, they must exist. An easy counter argument is to say that the statement is about the idea of a unicorn, but this is immediately disproved once you utter the statement.      Would anyone like to tackle this one? I had to consult many sources before coming up with a reasonable argument, so I'm interested in whether or not there are loopholes other than the one that I found. Enjoy!

A test that will prevent people using other people's urine or what ever they can think of also. The amounts of money and the abuser's of this epidemic is astonishing. And for the people who do work and struggle? Where are there resources?

PONDERING SLUMBER      In the soft shadows before dawn   When it is not yet day    Nor is it night   The stars slowly turning out their lights   My pulse quickens as i awake from my slumber   My mouth dry and grit in my eyes   The world is silent waiting to be awoken   Buds of flowers slowly uncurling   I wonder what the new day will bring   As i lay in my slumber   My mind begins to ponder   Do others think as I?   Can we think without a thought?   Can we reason without a reason?   Can we love without being loved?   I stretch my limbs as i ponder,   A new day something new to wonder   Yet there is one thing i am certain   And will always remain clear,   That in my end of days,   When my years are numbered   I will be happy for what i know,    And happier yet for what i dont.

20090222204939AATIjU7	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is life about? i have 6 theories of life and i think i'm actually insane! solipsism? please help!?	i have come up with 6 theories about life (i know i sound like a total weirdo, but i can't control it):      1. nothing exists. everything is fake. you, your dog, your uncle, and me. you might ask "if everything is fake, then how are you here right now?" but the answer to that: i don't know. it's just a theory that maybe nothing is real.   2. i'm the only real thing in the world and you are all in my imagination. when things don't go my way, i say to myself "why me?", well maybe it's because my imagination is making it this way. how can i tell you're real? i don't know, therefore you probably aren't real.   3. the purpose of life is to die. we all end up dying anyways, the question is when does it happen, and how do you die. but why are we here if we'll all end up dying? it's because this life is not important, it's the afterlife that matters, and you have to go through this life to get there.   4. it's all a dream. i'm actually dreaming right now. i might be some 40 year old guy living in my mom's basement, dreaming of another person and what his life would be. and i can't wake up from this dream. it seems so real, but it's a dream.   5. this sounds absolutely absurd, but here goes: everyone is a monster (other than me), and they are dressing up as humans in order to trick me into loving or hating them, only to realize they are all going to kill me.   6. God put me on this earth as a test - a test to see how humans would interact with other humans. no one is real, not even me. God just put me here to see if his idea of humans would work. if he believes it's working, then he might make more. if not, he won't.      PLEASE HELP ME, I'M INSANE

20090222192150AAIRfmD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A plot? Hmmm... Needs work so tell me what you think!?	Okay so I'm already working on a story, it's a tragic-romance-fairytale of sorts (much better than I can describe it here :P) but I REALLY want to write a book guys can enjoy too. Because this is ever so much of a girly book lol <3 (No I wouldn't give up on it, just when I got tired of romance and princesses I'd turn and write something this)      It'd be called SuperHuman.      And it'd be about a guy... possibly a werewolf (simply because they are sexy and way cooler than vamps) or just some guy who's genetically mutated and supppppperrrr strong. Now he'd be in high school, you see, and he'd have to cope with sports, girls, schoolwork, etc... but he'd also be a super hero, living in some big city, fighting off threats (some we don't even know to exist). Oh dear this sounds horrible and not original in the least... I just am brainstorming here...   If he was a werewolf he'd have a pack (pretty small) and they'd kind of be the protectors of the city, (it could be a big important city) So yes. It'd have lots of action and adventure... and I know I'd enjoy writing it, don't worry I'll add original twists and turns and give it more of a plot but this is just the very base of it.   What'chuu think? Would a guy read it? xD if not what kind of books DO guys like to read, lol?         NOTICE: This is not in the least bit inspired by twilight. I don't know why everyone thinks it is... because I'm thinking of making him a werewolf? Honestly, werewolves have been around in literature before Stephenie Meyer was even born. I HATE how now when anyone says: Vampire or Werewolf the whole world goes: OMG ITS LIKE TWILIGHT. No. It's not.       But Jacob Black still is sexy. (yes i am a twilight fan but I hate how blown out of proportion the whole thing has gotten)

20090222202945AAYUQKi	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Second chapter of my story?	When we got to the classroom, all of the students were already there in their seats. The only people who weren't there, were Tyler Walker because he did morning announcements, and Mr. Ript, who usually didn't show up until ten minutes after the tardy bell rang.       "Whoa, why do you two look so out of breath?" my other secret crush that only Gracie knows about, Josh, asked.       "We, um, thought we would be late to class, and neither of us finished our that paper, so we needed to get here before Mr. Ript did to finnish it." I lied.       "I thought he said that it wasn't for homework. Didn't he?" he asked      "I don't know. I wasn't really paying attention." I said, then looked behind me where Gracie sat and smiled. She rolled her eyes, smiled, and shook her head.       Just then, the door opened and slammed, and kids jumped. This is the sign that Mr. Ript has entered the classroom. (He's done that since the first day of ninth grade, and we still jump.) He walked over to his desk and started checking the attendance.       "Is Walker here?" he asked in his weird Texan accent mixed with something that sounded like a Brooklyn one.       "Yeah, I think so. Isn't he supposed to be doing announcements?" asked Scott Rickman.       "Oh yeah, that's right." replied Mr. Ript.       After the announcements, and Tyler returned, we had a pop quiz that was super easy. My hand was still itching, so I asked Mr. Ript if I could go to the office and get some calamine lotion for it. When I got to the office, there was a kid I'd never seen before talking with the principal, Ms. Hoover.       Ms. Hoover looked at me and said, "Oh hello Lillian. Can I help you?"      "Yes, actually. Do you think I could have some calamine lotion? My hand has been itching all day, and I think I might have a rash." I answered.       "Sure thing." she said while opening the drawer where they kept medical things. "I'm actually glad you're here. You see, this is Jake Smith." she said moving her eyes to the new boy. "You two seem to have most of the same classes together, so I was wondering if you could show him around the place."       "Sure." I said smiling at the new kid named Jake.      "Great." she said handing me the calamine lotion, then turning her attention to Jake, "Jake, Lillian here is one of our best students. Not just academically, but in all fields. She's the perfect person to go to if you need any help."       Jake turned to me and smiled. "Cool, you'll probably see me running to you a lot then, Lillian."      I smiled back at him and said, "Oh, probably not. I'll think you'll get a long just great here. It's easy finding you're way around here. And I assure you, all the students are very helpful. Ms. Hoover's right though, I'll always be here to help if you need me."      "Well, I think we're finished here," said Mrs. Hoover. "You're first class is advanced science, Jake, Mr. Ript's class.       "Alright, cool. Thanks Ms. Hoover." Jake said and smiled.       On our way back to science, I got my first real good look at Jake. He had shaggy, black hair with bangs brushed over to the left side of his face, and had crystal-blue eyes. He was wearing a red hoodie with a black star on it, and black jeans. To me, he was pretty cute.       I decided to start a conversation. "So, Jake, where'd you come from?" I asked.       "Las Vegas, Nevada." he replied.      "Really, that's cool. I've always wanted to visit there, but my mom said I shouldn't go until I'm at least twenty-one." I said.      "Yeah, it was pretty nice. I was living there with my dad after my mom died." he said with sadness in his voice, and his light, blue eyes turned dark.      "Oh, I'm sorry about your mom." I said, now guilty about bringing up mine.      My face must have said I was guilty because Jake attempted a smile and said, "Hey, it's okay, it happened a long time ago when I was still just a baby."       "I still feel bad though. It must suck not having a mom." I said, wondering what it would be like not having my mom around. She was the only person I was the closest to before Gracie.       "I don't really know. I can't remember much about her except her voice." he said.      There was an awkward silence all the rest of the way to science. When we got there, Mr. Ript was going over some of the questions that some of the kids said they had trouble on during the quiz.       "Took you long enough, Lillian." he said. "And who's this?" he asked pointing to Jake.       I smiled and said, "This is Jake Smith. He came from Las Vegas, Nevada." Then like an idiot I stated the obvious, "He's new here."       "Well, welcome to advanced science, Jake. I'm Mr. Ript." he said. "You can take the seat there behind Josh. He's the one with the big ears." he said making his usual "big-eared Josh" joke. "Here's the science book, and I want you to read pages one through one hundred, and I'll expect a five page report on my desk tomorrow." he said jokingly, as the bell rang signaling it was time for second period.

20090222200625AATf1mg	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Having trouble understanding and paraphrasing poem?	The poem is "Beauty, Time, and Love" by Samuel Daniel.      FAIR is my Love and cruel as she 's fair;    Her brow-shades frown, although her eyes are sunny.    Her smiles are lightning, though her pride despair,    And her disdains are gall, her favours honey:    A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour,    Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love;    The wonder of all eyes that look upon her,    Sacred on earth, design'd a Saint above.    Chastity and Beauty, which were deadly foes,    Live reconciled friends within her brow;    And had she Pity to conjoin with those,    Then who had heard the plaints I utter now?       For had she not been fair, and thus unkind,       My Muse had slept, and none had known my mind

20090222202830AALFGvM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I wrote a book...now what?	Hi! I'm 14 years old and I wrote a fiction novel. It is 126 Microsoft word pages (so about double that in actual book pages) and 66,557 words. (I'm not bragging but it may be useful to show my seriousness). What I would like to know is the next steps. I have peers, teachers and family reading it but after this step I'm stuck. What do I do? Do I get an editor first or an agent? Do I find an agent (how do i?) ? When I finally find a publisher do I include my own cover decorations, dedication page, about the author, etc? HELP? Any advice?      The story is about a girl who moves to Rome after graduating Highschool as an escape from reality. Her boyfriend falls into a coma after a car crash. She falls in love with a man and finds out he is a vampire. In this she finds out more about herself and discovers she is a half vamire herself. The vampires have been assimilating into human society for thousands of years and it is her aim to stop a war from breaking out between the two that would mean the illimination of the human race. The main character meets an angel and is forced to choose between the two. The angel helps her stop the war in the end but she finds that in trusting something that appeares so good and knowing so little about it that looks can be diceving. "even the devil may wear the face of an angel."       It is like twilight in only a few ways but I did not start twilight until I had almost finished and keep in mind twilight was not the first vampire book by any means.    Only similarities:   *Vampires    *Human falls in love with a vampire

20090222195945AATNOlm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Human-Vampire love story...?	I am not a teen, in fact I am 34.  I read the Twilight Books and enjoyed them thoroughly.  Mostly because I am a hopeless romantic, secondly because it has minimal high school drama, which (no offense to all high schoolers out there) I am happy I have left that part of my life behind.    Here is my impossible (I am hoping not) question:   Are there more books out there that are geared towards older crowds (or high schoolers as long as it is minimal amounts of hs drama), modern love story (to feed the romantic in me) human-vampire or human-nonhuman or even human-human with some action in it???   I know impossible right :))   So my formula is 70% love, 30% action.      I tried the Full Moon Rising and Anita Blake, not so crazy about them.  Scared to try anything from the teen section because I really don't think I have the patience for hs stuff (you will understand once you get passed it).  Also scared to try something from the Gushy Romance section well because as much as I really don't mind reading about sex I would also like it to be tastefully done.  Unless I am overlooking a specific author I just find most romance novels very cheesey.      Thank you very much for helping me on my book hunt.

20090426123104AAlxcbI	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Critique my Short Story?	It had been another grueling day in the office. As he walked into his small one bedroom apartment, he wondered how he ended up like this. Looking around his surroundings, he saw a flickering light bulb up above and a small table which would be covered with his evenings work in any moment. Barely able to survive financially, he used a worn out cot as a bed.       The only form of life that showed any promise, was a hamster spinning his days away on a hamster wheel. The man sighed, and placed his briefcase on the barely sturdy table. In his coat pocket was a bottle of scotch, which he had stolen just to feel alive even momentarily. He poured himself some and was lost in the work for the evening.       He looked up from the paperwork many hours later. How many? Well that he didn't know. If his bloodshot eyes and empty scotch bottle were any indication; chances are, it had been another all-nighter.       He yawned, and fondly looked over at the hamster. Wondering what it would be like to be free. Not having to answer to anyone, having someone to feed you, and get to lie around all day. Instead, he had to wake up from his stupor and go to work.       As he got home that night from a double shift. He couldn't help but wonder if humans had it all wrong. Wondering, what purpose is it just to work in hopes of getting by. Pets never having to work much beyond pleasing their master.       Walking inside, he repeated the same pattern he had so many times before. This time however, something was different. As he looked over to the hamster cage, the only thing he could see was a corpse laying eerily still.       If what had happened registered, it wasn't showing on his face. Instead, he just simply sighed. Throwing the glass overhead, opting instead to drink straight from the bottle. He gulped away, and sat there hoping this bottle would be the end of his pain.

The duo regarded each other across the divide and for innumerable lifetimes, none broke the calm.   "No."   He tried to read the expression on her face-or rather her lack of one...nothing there.   "Then what is it Maya, what's all this supposed to accomplish?"   Pregnant silence.   She sized him up indifferently; with the airy aloofness one might accord a mildly interesting portrait on a wall worth of some notice. A slow smile creased her face momentarily as she deigned him a minor threat and saw it fit to allow her sword arm purchase, a move easily misinterpreted as lowering her guard. Her royal blues appeared to glow eerily in the shadow of rapidly gathering night.   He sighed deeply to himself and shook his head.   "You know, if thou deem it not beneath your royal person,” he mocked lightly, hoping to at least get a rise from her,” We could sit down and talk about this. You know; like responsible adul..."   She smiled, an expression that didn't violate the coolness of her eyes.” We could try, but it wouldn't work."   "And exactly why would that be?"   With the annoying air of one trying to explain rudimentary Physics to a 10 year old, she yielded,” If you haven't noticed, every time we meet nowadays, the situation always corrodes down to the same thing." She said indicating her katana and his weapon, Erebus (the mysterious blade said to have been forged from the darkest shadows, collected and tempered in the deepest darkest regions of the Afterworld)   He frowned at the truth in her words. “Not to forget the that your 17 and I'm not even sure what my age is anymore.” Her eyes glinted slyly at him from behind her curtain of snow-white hair, “So we can't really discuss anything like responsible adults, can we?"   Woman had a point. Still...   God Maya, what happened to you? He thought to himself. Her eyes held neither passion nor purpose, just a distinct lack of warmth and notice. Somehow, he suspected that he didn't properly register in her conscious mind.   And if the eyes truly were the windows to one's soul, then this was an exercise in futility. She was too far-gone...

20090222214222AA5X0gb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Attempting to find the name of a Japanese novel. Please help!?	I read this book when I was very young so the details I remember are vague. But from what I can recall, it's about a girl and a mother (maybe a brother in a mix) whose home gets invaded by Koreans (I think) and they run away and go through a long journey.      I remember towards the end, there is an airport scene and the mother and the daughter live there for a little while as they are homeless. The mother always disappears to the bathroom with a roll of napkin and the girl assumes it's just for wiping but when the mother dies she presses the napkin into the girl's palm and tells her to hang on to it.      Later, the girl realizes that her mother has hidden a little bit of money in the napkin.      The girl also goes to school - although she is homeless and she is teased by the other kids for having dirty clothes and not having a paper or pencil to write with. She is scolded and basically put down every single day. She stays after school and I think the janitor tells her to help him sift through trash to find her a pencil to write with.      Anyway, it's an unbelievably touching story and I would love to get a hold of that book again and reread now that I actually speak English (I moved here from another country and was attempting to learn English as I was reading this novel).      Did anyone recognize this novel? Perhaps you can give me another source I can turn to for some advice - like a forum or a friend you know of who knows of Japanese novels?      Thank you

20090222213900AARkaLm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	As I Lay Dying by Faulkner or The Crossing by McCarthy?	I have to read a choice book for my English class and i narrowed my choices down to these two novels. I am looking for an easier and hopefully a faster read (I don't have much time for homework recently, due to my internship/ community service hours), as well as a more enjoyable read.       The focus of reading any book is to "broaden our understanding of stylistic choices writers make," so any help/ knowledge of each book (if you've read it) would help!      Thanks,      Liz.

Can anybody tell me the name of the of the person (theorist) who articulated the Socio-neurological basis for the "generational digital divide"??? or give me the source    The theory is fascinating. It goes something like this (I probably have the following 60% correct)...       Those born after 1980...   a) have always been around computers       b) their brains are wired differently than those born before 1980       c) they process quick snips of information better. their brains were formed by MTV        c1) They have attention deficit disorder (ADD). They can not pay attention to one thing too long. Good at multi-tasking; bad as prolonged focused attention.       c2) In a study of a Superbowl ad (the Michael Jorden Space Jam's commercial, with Daffy duck?), the younger generation understood the commercial yet the older generation did not. The commercial was a series of really quick snips, around 30 snips in 30 seconds. The older generation could not follow nor comprehend the commercial's story line.       d) they type very fast with their thumbs on PDAs; they have excellent eye-thumb coordination.

20090222214835AA2kQNo	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this piece of writing ok?	i tried re-writing a scene from a book in first person, but I'm not a very good writer so I'm not sure if i successfully wrote in first person or not...   so, if anyone's good at writing in first person tell me if I'm doing it right :)      here's the writingness       January 6, 1965 (8:00am)      The smell of blueberry pie filled the air. As I breathed the warm air I got up and sauntered over to the kitchen, stopping at the door way I stood and watched as my wife quickly wiped the counter top, moving with caution as she avoided bumping her overgrown belly on the pointed edge of the counter. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, allowing the smell of the pies to calm my mind. I reopened my eyes slowly to see that my wife’s movements had froze, at that moment my body had also become stiff. I could barely detect the smell of pies while I stared at Agnes. I could only see the left side of her face but her expression seemed pained. A cloud of fear and excitement formed over my head and in a shaky voice I quietly asked, “Has it started?” “Yes!” her sharp, quick response turned my fear into a storm of worry “we have to go to the hospital!” I half shouted. “No, no I have enough time to finish these pies then teach my English lesson”. I struggled for words, but had no luck in my panicky state, because every sentence I tried to construct did not seem strong enough to break her stubbornness. Well…. Trying is better than giving up I suppose… “Honey! We have to get you to the hospital now! The pies can wait” my futile effort went unnoticed, Agnes got out some cards and began writing pie notes. “Honey?....” “I’m fine, really I can wait, but these pies can’t” she gave me a justified look and continued with her pie notes. I felt there was nothing more I could say so I walked back to the sofa. Quite frustrated, I tried to construct possible sentences that may convince Agnes to abandon her pies. As I sat my anger slowly washed away and I was left only with thoughts of the future, I could feel myself getting anxious as I stared at the clock, it’s blank face staring back at me, “tick tick tick” with each tick I grew more anxious and even excited, because my first son was hours from being born.      (the original scene thing was written by dean Koontz)
20090222214913AAyabIg	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	How can I accomplish my dream?	I've always wanted to act and ever since I was little, I've always wanted to perform. Although, I feel my parents just hold me back. I'm 15 and I know I'm young but I feel as if I don't start now then I'll never accomplish it. I'm in many high school productions but I want to do more. My mom doesn't feel the need to pay for acting classes and thinks every agency is a scam. Plus after high school, I want to try to get into a conservatory performing arts school in New York but she rather have me stay in Las Vegas. I almost can't take it anymore and feel she holds me back. How can I try to further my ambition with or without my parents help?

20090426121631AAPM3xe	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem good for my age (I'm 13...)?	I wrote this poem for my best friend's mom. She and I are very close, and she has been more like a mom to me than my own mother. I wanted to show her how much I lover her, it it any good? I'm only 13 so I would appreciate constructive criticism if it is needed! Thanks a bunch!      P.S. Any title ideas???      “ “      You may not be my mom,   but you were always there.   Never had to think twice   about knowing when to share.      You cared for me   as if I was your own.   I will never forget   the generosity you’ve shown.      You had your own family,   but still made room for me.   Welcomed me with open arms   when I had fallen on my knees.      Held me as I watched   my family being torn apart.   You were the rock I grasped   when I needed a jump start.      Your life an inspiration   that I saw every day.   I wanted what you had   Despite the price I must pay.      That’s when I knew,   It wasn’t you I was seeing.   But rather our Creator,   a non-human being.      He lives inside of you,   and shines through the cracks.   Makes you beautiful inside and out,   no matter how much you think you may lack.      Thank you for all the love you poured on me,   whether I was worthy or not.   You will forever be in my heart,   for I’ve already carved out a spot.      By: Brianna

LULA: Para atingir o ponto "G"      CHAVES: Foi sem querer querendo!      PLAT?O: Porque buscava alcan?ar o Bem.       ARISTóTELES: é da natureza dos frangos cruzar a estrada.       NELSON RODRIGUES: Porque viu sua cunhada, uma galinha sedutora, do outro lado.       MARX: O atual estágio das for?as produtivas exigia uma nova classe de frangos, capazes de cruzar a estrada.       MOISéS: Uma voz vinda do céu bradou ao frango: "Cruza a estrada!" E o frango cruzou a estrada e todos se regozijaram.       ALMIR KLINK: Para ir onde nenhum frango jamais esteve.       MARTIN LUTHER KING: Eu tive um sonho. Vi um mundo no qual todos os frangos serao livres para cruzar a estrada sem que sejam questionados seus motivos.       MAQUIAVEL: A quem importa o por quê? Estabelecido o fim de cruzar a estrada, é irrelevante discutir os meios que utilizou para isso.       FREUD: A preocupa?ao com o fato de o frango ter cruzado a estrada é um sintoma de sua inseguran?a sexual.       DARWIN: Ao longo de grandes períodos de tempo, os frangos têm sido selecionados naturalmente, de modo que, agora, têm uma predisposi?ao genética a cruzar estradas.       EINSTEIN: Se o frango cruzou a estrada ou a estrada se moveu sob o frango, depende do ponto de vista. Tudo é relativo.       HEMINGWAY: "To die. Alone. In the rain."       FHC: Por que ele atravessou a estrada, nao vem ao caso. O importante é que, com o Plano Real, o povo está comendo mais frango.       GEORGE ORWELL: Para fugir da ditadura dos porcos.       SARTRE: Trata-se de mera faticidade. A existência do frango está em sua liberdade de cruzar a estrada.       MACONHEIRO: Mó viagem, brother....huhuuu!!!       CRIAN?A: Porque sim.       BAHIANO: Oche!!!quando ele atravessou eu tava era dormindo, aí que pregui?aaaa!!!      POLIANA: Porque estava feliz.       PINOCHET: El se fué, pero tengo muchos penachos de el en mi mano!       ACM: Estava tentando fugir, mas já tenho um dossiê pronto, comprovando que aquele frango pertence a Jorge Amado. Quem o pegar vai ter que se ver comigo.       FEMINISTAS: Para humilhar a franga, num gesto exibicionista, tipicamente machista, tentando, além disso, convencê-la de que, enquanto franga, jamais terá habilidade suficiente para cruzar a estrada.       PDT: Para protestar contra as perdas internacionais promovidas por esse governo neoliberal e antreguista, e apoiar a renúncia de FHC, já ! Fora FHC!       MALUF: Nao tenho nada a ver com isso. Pergunte ao Pitta.       NIETZSCHE: Ele deseja superar a sua condi?ao de frango, para tornar-se um superfrango.       CHE GUEVARA: Hay que cruzar la carretera, pero sin jamás perder la ternura...       BLAISE PASCAL: Quem sabe? O cora?ao do frango tem razoes que a própria razao desconhece.       SOCRATES: Tudo que sei é que nada sei.       PARMENIDES: O frango nao atravessou a estrada porque nao podia mover-se. O movimento nao existe.
