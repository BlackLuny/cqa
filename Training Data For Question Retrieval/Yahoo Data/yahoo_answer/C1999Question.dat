20090307012602AAg60h8	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Which Mobile phone should i choose, N95 or N85?	After some opinions and advice please.   I used to have a Nokia N95 but then lost it. I have just been offered a Nokia N85 from the company that insures my phone as a replacement as they are saying the Nokia N95 is discontinued (at least in their stock).   My first question is, isn't the Nokia N95 a newer phone?   My second question is, Is the N95 a better or more superior phone than the N85 if so whats the differences?      I'm not sure if the insurance people are trying to pull a fast one and give me a inferior phone to the N95. The policy does state that (not in these exact words), Either a replacement phone will be offered, or a similar one in price, specification or functionality. Or a cash settlement. This of course is all at their discretion   I personally liked the N95 and would very much like the same phone as a replacement. But would i be better to accept the N85 or are they trying it on???      Constructive answers only please and i will choose a Best Answer

Also, I'm always worried that the songs that are on my ipod nut not on the itunes will be erased... so any advise or tips about that will be good too.

Can someone give me the bottom line in comparing video editing software- $60. versions to the boxed - $4,000 version?

I would like to know if it's capable to host a match on COD4 online.   It's not really about luck, it might be mainly about your connection.      * I have 100% connection (it's right next to my PS3).   * I have NAT Type 2 (Always).   * Most of the time it's only the PS3 connected to the router, and not our computers so it should be fast most of the time.      When I invite a party and find games, I never get to be the host but when my friend does it he's always the host. >_<       So, I'm just wondering what's the problem really.. Does it include anything about ports? (I think I might know something about port forwarding..)   Oh and if my router isn't good then please feel free to suggest me a better one!

We havn't realy had any problem with it at all up until last night. Now it's not working and I am not sure what to do.      What happened was this...      it was working fine yesturday and last night me and my boyfriend wanted to play guitar hero so we brought it into our room. We got it set up and turned on ok. I even turned it off and back on.      Well after getting the game all set up and picking our songs we went to play and realized my boyfriend hadn't plugged the micraphone in like I asked him. So he goes to plug it in and as he gets it into the slot the whole xbox just shuts off. And we can not get it to turn back on.      I didn't see the red ring of death when it died but my boyfriend says he saw a red ring. Though he can not telll me if it was a full ring or just 3 sides. but either way shouldn't the red ring of death apper every time I try to turn it on??      Now I just push the button and nothing happened.      Can anyone help me out any??       Also we have tried different outlits and nothing. Also the power strip still has that orange light on it when it's plugged in so I don't think it's a power problem.      I just got out of a 13 day stay in the hospital. And I really don't want to conclude that my 300 dollar toy my mom got me and I will not be able to replace (money wise) is broken.      So please any help would be really really appreacited

20090307074552AAh9ZXA	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Why isn't GAME giving me a new ps3 because my old one broke,(i have a warranty)?	i have a warranty and my playstation keeps and freezing when i play games and im on the internet browser, i cant install demos when i download games, my ps3 keeps and making a loud noise like a mini hoover when i play games.         i phoned GAME and they said i bring my whole ps3 system to their shop and i test it out. they put a random game in my ps3 and i played it for 10-15 mins, the ps3 never, froze, or made louse noises like a mini hoover. i said to the manager of GAME that it's not freezing and not making loud noise right now although its been doing that for the last 2-3 weeks!   she said she cant replace my ps3 because nothing has happened and nothing is wrong with my ps3, i told her how would she know if i only play for 10-25 mins and it doesnt freeze, she said that she is gonna leave the ps3 on all day and see if it freezes but i told her it only freezes when i play games, how does she know if my ps3 freezes if she isnt even going to play on it and just leave it on all night, any member of staff at any store would understand that it is her fault and that she should be giving me a new ps3! am i in the wrong or is she in the wrong? what do you think? who do you think is right? WHY IS SHE NOT GIVING ME A NEW PS3!!!!

20090307075436AAXyxda	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	I want the 2.0 update for my ipod touch not 2.2?	Ok so i have the 1.1.5 ipod touch and i thought that getting the 2.0 would be fine until i saw they were charging for it but i didnt want to pay.So i finally decided what the heck ill pay but now i see they have 2.2 update,i dont want this!   I dont think if i get the 2.2 it would include the 2.0 as well.   the itunes website doesnt even have a place where u can get the 2.0,they only have 2.2.   I DO NOT want to jailbreak my ipod nor do i want to download the 2.0 for free on some random website!   I want to PAY for the 2.0 but i just cant find it on the apple website.   Question...if i upgrade from a 1.1.5 to a 2.2,what features wouldnt be added because i skipped 2.0?
