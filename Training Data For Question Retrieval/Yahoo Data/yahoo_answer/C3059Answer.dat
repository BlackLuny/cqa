ByxEE8eeaa	I had a farmer's market stall (Canada) selling organic produce and handcrafted bracelets. I think the key is setting up an attractive display with lots to look at. My produce didn't sell well (except the figs, which sold like hotcakes!) but my friend's bracelets were selling quite well. She had a tablecloth and a tilted board displaying her bracelets. She also worked on bracelets throughout the day for people who wanted specific patterns. I'm not sure if that's an option for your greeting cards, but make sure you display them well, and avoid making the stall look tacky. Good luck!|`|ab7wGFEEaa	listen too me i was in the market game for 12years it bought me my house nice cars and a good life for 8 of those 12 years and in the last 4 of those 12 it ate every thing i had trying to keep it afloat i dont wont to be a downer try it but i'd sell your stuff on ebay no fuel no rent no work and no pikes's trying to nick stuff  but saying that there's still a few  boy having a few quid all the best....|`|erWg46nOaa	I wholesale shoes,clothes,handbags and so on,cant help you too.But welcome to visite my site. :)|`|JUUmf7lnaa	I'm excited for you!<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I don't know anything about it.

Providing you have good health, and loved by your family, what more could you wish for? With out being too personal do you live in a city, or on the land?

In this cashless society of ours where the banking industry has come a long way from the over-the-counter transactions we grew up in, it's great what the role EFTPOS offers to the consumers.<br>  <br>  I was a tourist in Australia some years back and used to go for groceries at Coles, where EFTPOS was widely used to pay for stuff bought at the supermarket. Aside from the huge interest I took in your local flora and fauna, your Australian way of life and the country's history, I took great delight in the modern and new stuff, like the EFTPOS, which was then just being introduced in my country.<br>  <br>  It's fast, easy and safe way to do financial transactions and the electronic fund transfer cuts on manpower costs as it streamlines  everything. Doing business becomes a lot more organized and systematic with its use.|`|sxsOGoJ5aa	it helps to cut the risk of crime (robberies etc and fingers in the till) and it is a good cash flow positive device as in cheques don't bounce.
