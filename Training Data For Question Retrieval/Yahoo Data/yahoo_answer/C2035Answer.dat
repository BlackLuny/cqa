02089f6fc6bb59ed2f32bd8e95eec733aa	It would most likely work decently well as a PS3 display, but I have a few concerns:<br>  <br>  - First, the screen resolution that you have listed would indicate that this screen has a 16:10 aspect ratio as opposed to the traditional widescreen TV aspect ratio of 16:9. This could cause games to be displayed with very narrow black bars on the top and/or bottom. Also, this display isn't going to be capable of displaying 1080p because the resolution is too low. With a screen this small though that really won't matter. <br>  <br>  - You'll also need to check to make sure this set is capable of accepting many different typical TV resolutions (480i, 480p, 1080i, etc.) and scaling them well in order to assure that this is a flexible display that can be used with all of the different components you might currently have (such as old consoles).<br>  <br>  - The contrast ratio is a bit low, but it would probably be okay.<br>  <br>  - You don't list the display's response time. I would recommend at least 12ms or less in order to avoid any significant ghosting. This is very important!<br>  <br>  - This TV is only HD-Ready. There are many affordable TVs out there today with HD tuners built in so I might look into that. This isn't really a big deal though if you'll just be using this for DVDs and games.|`|Qq0NTlqLaa	seems good to me. any high def, plama screen t.v. is good enough for a ps3|`|a4dfc5f6d4cdc66f0414f974e54368f9aa	Good if you're sitting 3 feet away... go for at least a 32".

Perhaps it has something to do with the daylight saving time changing over earlier than usual this year?

The problem with Verizon (and Sprint) is that their phones are directly connected to service. So, if the phone breaks, you have no choice but to buy a new phone again (costly since they already have you under contract). If you move to a carrier tha uses SIM cards (T-mobile, cingular, att), if your phone breaks, then you can simply buy a new or used phone (amazon, craiglist, ebay) and simply insert the SIM card into the new phone. And you are back in business.|`|JrRRnFsAaa	You can renew your contract before the renewal term.  You just can't cancel and switch providers.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	There are several differences between Blu-ray and HD-DVD.  The main difference between the two is that Blu-ray holds 25 gb and 50 gb for a dual layer, while HD-DVD holds 15 gb and 30 gb for a dual layer HD-DVD.  <br>  <br>  Another difference is that companies can use DVD machines to make HD-DVD disks, while companies have to buy new machines to make Blu-ray disks. <br>  <br>  Third major difference is that 4 of the top five movie companies support Blu-ray, and the top 3 support Blu-ray.  Only Universal support HD-DVD.  Warner Bros. support both formats.<br>  <br>  I personally prefer Blu-ray because it's vital to my gaming life.  Playstation 3 games are in Blu-ray disks, while there are no games that are in HD-DVD disks.  The Blu-ray also have a bigger storage space, so more extras can be put on the disk.|`|dee2aeeacdfd3b88a3a9ab76a5a72b92aa	The above answer is all correct, although from a consumer standpoint, there's no real difference.  Blu Ray discs can hold more information, but both formats can easily hold a 1080p picture and uncompressed sound.  You should see no difference in video or hear no difference in audio when watching the same movie on Blu Ray or HD-DVD.<br>  <br>  HD-DVD has been more successful implementing more "interactive" features on their discs.  For instance the movie 300 will have more features on the HD-DVD version because of this.  Blu Rays will (or should) do this eventually, but it's not 100% completed.  Since these are just special features and not part of the movie itself, I don't think its a big deal.  Eventually both formats will be even.<br>  <br>  I do like the lower prices of HD-DVDs.  On the whole they offer better pricing on hardware and slightly on software.  The negative is that HD-DVDs aren't supported by Sony, Fox, or Disney.  Fox isn't releasing anything on HD these days, but Sony has a nice library and Disney finally started releasing interesting titles (i.e. the Pirates movies).  Right now the selection of movies exclusive to each format is pretty even.  HD-DVD has The Matrix, Batman Begins, the Bourne movies, King Kong, etc...  Blu Ray has The Pirates movies, Casino Royale, etc..  Eventually this should swing Blu Ray's way, provided studios actually release content and decide to stay exclusive to a particular format.<br>  <br>  If I'm forced to choose, I'd take Blu Ray, but there's not much of a difference to me.  Both serve their purposes equally well.

BwbLmMd2aa	from what i've seen in Cool Edit Pro 2.1, the vocal cut option just cuts a lot of frequencies detected as vocals. So the song gets played with a very tinny sound and mostly music is heard but you can still hear vocals underneath. As far as I know there is no real way to actually CUT the vocals without actually having access to the master tracks.

La calidad de esas fotos no es mala, asimismo tens que tener en cuenta otros factores que pueden hacer tus fotos de mala calidad, como por ejemplo la luz del ambiente (pens que casi siempre el flash alcanza slo 5 mts).   El zoom puede hacer tambin que pierdas calidad en las fotos, ya que el pixel se ve ms grande.|`|b63dd275d90f01ef4bfee750df12a96eaa	el pixel es la unidad en que se miden las imagenes. es lo que mide la resolucion. a mayores pixeles mejor resolucion de la imagen. es como tener una imagen formada con pocos puntitos (pixeles), entonces no tiene tanta definicion, pero si tienes una imagen formada por muchos mas puntos, pues es mejor la resolucion. asi es como funciona la medida de los pixeles. actualmente hay camaras tan poderosas que toman fotos con definicion de hasta 7 u 8 megapixeles. la decision de comprar una camara de 1.3 o ms megapixeles, depende de para que la quieras. si quieres solamente tomar fotos por diversion y para el album familiar, no es necesario tener tanta resolucion, aunque ahora avanza la foto digital tan rapidamente, que hay camaras de 3 o 4 megapixeles que no son tan caras y son mucho mejores que las de 1 o 2.|`|10aac54cbccef9869f5cbf5b6193818faa	1.3 megapixeles es buena calidad, siempre y cuando sean reales  algunas cmaras chafas usan un truco que se llama interpolacin para darte esa resolucin, lo que hace que las fotos se vean con poco detalle.|`|0828e7c3fe446c6824a08106a894e6c2aa	1.3 mpx es una camara normal , tomas fotos y  ya pero  nada ke ver con una buena calidad,, ni tampoco te sirve para trabajos profesionales  pura diversion|`|82d75d448b6ee4a8b4ed813076d82f80aa	Es la calidad, si le pones mucho zoom una cmara de pocos pixeles como 1 se va a ver borrosa la imagen, y si quieres hacer la foto mas grande, entre mas grande se va a ver mas borroso si tiene pocos pixeles|`|d973c5fb3b1336fe20c725c40e078561aa	Mira, una cmara de 1.3 megapixeles produce imgenes de 1280 x 960 pixeles.    La resolucin recomendada para imprimir fotografas es de 300 pixeles por pulgada.    A esa resolucin tu cmara de 1.3 Megapixeles puede imprimir fotos de unas 4" x 3"; aproximadamente la mitad de las fotos normales de 4" x 6".    Hoy en da lo recomendable es tener al menos 5 megapixeles para poder imprimir bien fotos en tama?o normal e incluso poder ampliarlas un poco a 8" x 6" sin perder resolucin.

Unless you have internet on your phone and want to buy songs online, I would suggest just buying the micro SD card with the adapter, and it's pretty easy from there.  Your phone probably doesn't have an outlet for anything else but the charger.  I bought the microsd card and adapter, and a usb connection (because I didn't have a port although most people do) and it was just a drag and drop process of songs.  You however would only have to buy the microSD card which costs $20.  It's worth it, I love my phone  Good luck!

IDTFO7kuaa	I would ask yourself which type of HD you are looking for?  LCD, Plasma, DLP, LED, Laser, front projection, rear projection? I will say this as far as brands are concerned, you do get what you pay for.  TOP brands, in my opinion, would consist of companies like Sony, Pioneer, Panasonic, and Samsung. Vizio and Philips are also good products at a more reasonable price.  If you haven't heard of the name before, then trust your intuition, and stay clear.  Look for sets that have higher contrast ratios.  This deals with the range of colors and whites to black. (29,000:1 or higher)  Refresh rates help to resolve issues like the stairstep effect you get from fast moving objects (i.e. sports, action flicks) they range from 60hz to 120hz (50hz to 100hz, overseas) for LCDs and Plasmas usually have anywheres up to 480hz, depending on their set up.  Response time should be low.  6.5ms response time is average on an entry level set.  Anything below that is great. Resolution is important as well.  1080p sets are great especially when watch HD or Blu-ray content.  It's also important when purchasing larger screens.  Having 1080p for a screen such as a 32" set is overkill, but they do make screens that size with this resolution.  But personally I would suggest getting one of that size with a 720p and save money if that is the route you would take.  37" and up? 1080p, definitely.  How many sources do you plan on inputting into your set? Look at that aspect as well.  Also, most TVs have a USB input that allows you to download firmware updates to resolve issues that the might encounter.  Philips has this capabiltiy.     Every type of set has its UPS and DOWNS.  Plasmas produce better black levels, but LCD's are catching up. Check Sony's XBR series LCD's. LCD's run cooler, plasmas emit a lot of heat. Pioneer Elites Kuro plasma is supposed to have the best black reproductions. Some say the life of Plasmas can't be measured and how to dispose of or repair has been addressed.    Plasmas have a marginally lower retail price than LCDs. LCDs can have a sharper picture while (my opinion) plasmas are clean and clear but softer in display.    Plasmas have a glass screen making reflection of light an issue. LCD's usually have a flat finish making reflections almost non existent.    LCD's are better for gaming, Plasmas for movies (my opinion). LCD's aren't as prone to burn-in like Plasmas used to be. But LCD's do get it . Orbital pixelation for plasmas has helped resolve this problem.    Consider your room aesthetics and viewing position as well.  This site will help you determine the optimal size set that would be right for you depending on viewing distance. www.engadgethd.com/2006/12/09/ 1080p-charted-viewing-distance-to-screen...    Also, regardless of what brand you get depending on your budget, I would recommend that you set some cash aside for an extended warranty plan.  Just because it's a reputable high end brand doesn't mean it comes without its flaws and it's better to protect yourself when investing in a good set.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	1Measure the area where you intend to put the TV. Be sure to only look for TVs that will fit in the allotted space.   Step2Determine what type of HDTV is for you. There are many different styles: direct-view (regular tube), LCD, plasma and rear-projection TVs. Each has its own different qualities that are appealing.   Step3Consider what display type of HDTV is for you. These TVs come in HD ready (can display regular TV broadcasts on their own), Integrated HDTV (comes equipped with an ATSC digital tuner that offer the ability to broadcast network HD programs on its own, but not satellite or cable without a box) and Digital-Cable-Ready (DCR) sets (utilize a cable card directly in the TV to receive HD programs from cable or satellite companies).   Step4Search the Internet for TVs that match the qualities you want. Chain store Web sites like Best Buy, Circuit City, Target and Wal-Mart can get you started finding what's available and comparing prices before shopping in the store. Web sites such as Consumer Reports can help you determine the best buys.   Step5Hit the stores and check out the TVs. Dont check only the electronic qualities of the TV, but its aesthetic qualities also. Talk to store personnel about HDTVs. Ask questions about TV performance, ease of use and bang for your buck. You may also want to find out what their bestseller is and how it's warranty works.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	The features that you should look when buying HDTV.   - Resolution (1080p,720p,1080i) 1080p ia the best.   - Contrast ratio,the higher contrast ratio give you better picture.   - response time,less response time is better   - connection port  Good brand for HD TV that I suggest are Samsung,Sony or Panasonic.|`|6088137d3595c339f61f6c6e95124f6daa	brand does matter. only low end brand id do is vizio because of great experiences. resolution, if u get 37"+ id recommend 1080p. refresh rate, lower the better. contrast ratio, higher the better (even tho there is no general regulation for different brands to compare). brightness, higher the better (avg is 450-550 and only hardly notice diff)    just dont get crap like memorex, polaroid, jvc, etc.
RyvKws7Laa	At that distance, 42" and above will give you the ability to get all of the advantages of Plasma and 1080p.  If you go bigger all the better.  I think 50" would be a really nice fit if you can afford it/fit, but 42" would sever you well too.    Remember to condition the Plasma.  For the first 100-200 hours crank the brightness and contrast (picture) way down.  This will condition the gasses.  Then after that go ahead and optimize and enjoy your viewing experience.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	LCD is the better quality picture, get one with a higher raster rate 120 hz.  get the largest you can afford|`|xmr7W8ndaa	About a 63" television will give you the THX recommended viewing angle.

Personally, I'd say 50".
V2nLbZZ5aa	A wide screen TV is always a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means you can always find out what the width and height of the display are by the two ratios of Height = Diagonal/1.15 and Width = Diagonal/2.04.    Remember that this is only the measurements of the display, not the actual size of the TV.  That data has to come from the TV manufacturer.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	There's a brand new invention that will help with this....it's called a TAPE MEASURE.|`|WUBZrmXzaa	You can't. Think about it -- a tall thin TV has the same diagonal measure as a wide, thin one (just turned on its side). A variety of widths and heights can have the same diagonal. Go to a site like Amazon that lists the TV you want - it usually shows its WxHxD dimensions as well, then you will know.

ulg6AYLIaa	what would you expect from americans|`|xmr7W8ndaa	True story:    In the 60's RCA was the number one TV maker and Sears was the number one seller of televisions.    Sony went to RCA and said: "We can make the TV's for you if you buy enough." and RCA let Sony make the TV's.    Then Sony went to Sears and said "We can sell TV's to you for cheaper than RCA and put yoru name on them." and Sears started doing this.    Then Sony went back to RCA and said: "You are not buying enough televisions so the price for the TV's you are buying is now double."      Then in the 70's Zenith was sold to overseas interests.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	Primarily the costs of labor and real estate (needed for a factory), and industrial regulations would make the   TVs cost significantly more that Americans would be willing to spend on a TV set.

When I was growing up, I can remember my grandmother watching Ironsides, Streets of San Francisco, Kojack, Marcus Wellby M.D. Billy Graham Crusades, Johnny Carson and at the end of the year Guy Lombardo on a Zenith television. Neither Grandmother would purchase any other brand tv other than Zenith's floor model.  I can recall Curtis Mathis tv's, the RCA commercials, Phillips and though not a tv brand, a once dominant Motorola cb radios and walkie talkies.  Of the names listed more than 90% have gone out of business or they have branched off to different types of electronics where they are no longer the dominant brand. RCA and Phillips continues to make televisions, but it is no longer their priority, they have ceded their dominance to Sony, former Goldstar now LG tv, Samsung, Toshiba, Hitachi and the like.  These companies have made building TV's a top priority, it is what they are known to do.  Even if the American brands are still in the game, they are not the dominant brand in this area because they have de-centralized brand name and expertise; sort of like that old saying "jack of all trades, master of none." I guess the short answer to your question is that America stopped building TVs a long time ago.|`|j7rBM2yTaa	American companies did not put enough money into research and development for TVs. Also, the cost of labour in America is very high compared with far-eastern countries.

23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	The television will probably show NTSC pictures (with black bars top and bottom) if it's fairly modern. Just connect the SCART lead and the timebase and colour systems will take care of themselves. Don't expect it to be as good as PAL though - NTSC is not such a good colour system.     If you have any problem it will be the region code of the DVD player.    Most NTSC DVDs are restricted to Region 1 and most PAL DVD players will only play Region 2 discs.  If you have a multi-region player then you are ok. But if it's not multi-region then you will have to search the internet for a hack to unlock it. Have a look at the back of the player or it's box or instruction book. That will tell you what regions it will play.|`|zujPAY10aa	If your DVD will play it, your tv will display it.|`|9qymF2xlaa	My TV is PAL, when I play US/CA DVD's in my multi-region DVD player, they display on my PAL TV okay..

fvre0o9laa	It's both more machine than you need and probably less quality than you need... at least my experiences with cheap machines are that they are often pretty erratic after you've used them for awhile.   I had a similar machine about 15 years ago -- wore it to unrepairability in about two years of not so heavy use -- cost per project wound up being about $10 on that machine.  My current machine was suck-wind expensive new, has performed flawlessly for about 13 years now, and amortized costs are about $1/project right now.  I was recently at "my" dealers and saw a used twin of my machine priced at $150, fwiw.    Here's my standard beginner sewing machine rant:  http://www.cet.com/~pennys/faq/smfaq.htm    What I want for beginners in sewing:    - a machine that doesn't scare you  - a machine that isn't balky (cheap new machines are often very    balky or need adjustments often and are rarely repairable --    just too frustrating to learn on!)  - very good straight stitch  - good zigzag (4-5 mm is fine, more than that is gravy)  - a method of making buttonholes that makes sense to you  - adjustable presser foot pressure (which helps some fabric    handling issues)  - accessory presser feet that don't cost an arm and a leg    (machines that use a "short shank foot" typically handle    generic presser feet pretty well.  Some brands of machines use    proprietary or very expensive presser feet)    If the budget stretches far enough:    - blindhem and stretch blindhem stitches  - triple zigzag (nice for elastic applications)  - a couple of decorative stitches (you won't use them nearly as    much as you think)  - electronic machine because of the needle position control and    because the stepper motors give you full "punching force" at    slow sewing speeds -- mechanical machines often will stall at    slow speeds.      Please go to the best sewing machine dealers around and ask them  to show you some machines in your price range, *especially* used  machines you can afford. You'll get a far better inexpensive machine buying used than new, and a good dealer is worth their weight in sewing machine needles when you get a machine problem --   often they can  talk you through the problem over the phone. While you're trying  things out, try a couple of machines (sewing only, not combo  sewing-embroidery) over your price limit, just so you can see  what the difference in stitch quality and ease of use might be.  You may find you want to go for the used Cadillac. Or you might  want the new basic Chevy. Might as well try both out.    Suggested reading: John Giordano's The Sewing Machine Book  (especially for used machines), Carol Ahles' Fine Machine Sewing  (especially the first and last few chapters) and Gale Grigg  Hazen's Owner's Guide to Sewing Machines, Sergers and Knitting  Machines. All of these are likely to be available at your public  library.    Used brands I'd particularly look for: Elna, Bernina,  Viking/Husqvarna, Pfaff, Singer (pre 1970), Juki, Toyota    New "bargain brand" I'd probably pick, if new was my choice:  Janome (who also does Kenmore).

AA10098742	the creative Zen will not work in your car through the USB port as the data is not stored on the player as outside acsessable data. the only way to play it through your car stereo is to get either a wireless FM transmitter or a FM transiever that is wired to your antenna. this option is hardwired to the antenna and will not provide static.     The best way to do it is if your deck has an aux input. that would be the cleanest sound.

IDTFO7kuaa	closed-circuit television  It uses video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors for security purposes like banks and parking lots of stores and in shopping malls, etc.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Closed captioning is a term describing several systems developed to display text on a television or video screen to provide additional or interpretive information to viewers who wish to access it. Closed captions typically display a transcription of the audio portion of a program as it occurs (either verbatim or in edited form), sometimes including non-speech elements.    Contents [show]  1 Terminology   2 Application   3 Television and video   4 Caption channels   5 DVDs   6 Movies   7 Video games   8 Theater   9 Telephones   10 Media monitoring services   11 HDTV interoperability issues   11.1 Americas   11.1.1 Incompatibility issues with HDTV   11.2 Europe   11.3 DTV standard captioning improvements   12 History   13 Logo   14 Bibliography   15 See also   16 References   17 External links          [edit] Terminology     The Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration used closed captioning on some JumboTrons.The term "closed" in closed captioning indicates that not all viewers see the captions  only those who choose to decode or activate them. This distinguishes from "open captions" (sometimes called "burned-in" or "hardcoded" captions), which are visible to all viewers.    Most of the world does not distinguish captions from subtitles. In the United States and Canada, these terms do have different meanings, however: "subtitles" assume the viewer can hear but cannot understand the language, so they only translate dialogue and some on-screen text. "Captions" aim to describe all significant audio content  spoken dialogue and non-speech information such as the identity of speakers and their manner of speaking  along with music or sound effects using words or symbols.    The United Kingdom, Ireland, and most other countries do not distinguish between subtitles and closed captions, and use "subtitles" as the general term  the equivalent of "captioning" is usually referred to as "Subtitles for the hard of hearing". Their presence is referenced on screen by notation which says "Subtitles" or previously "Subtitles 888" (the latter is in reference to the conventional teletext channel for captions).      [edit] Application  Most commonly, closed captions are used by deaf or hard of hearing individuals to assist comprehension. They can also be used as a tool by those learning to read, learning to speak a non-native language, or in an environment where the audio is difficult to hear or is intentionally muted. Captions can also be used by viewers who simply wish to read a transcript along with the program audio.    In the United States, the National Captioning Institute noted that 'English-as-a-second-language' (ESL) learners were the largest group buying decoders in the late 1980s and early 1990s before built-in decoders became a standard feature of US television sets. This suggested that the largest audience of closed captioning was people whose native language was not English. In the United Kingdom, of 7.5 million people using TV subtitles (closed captioning), 6 million have a hearing disability[citation needed].    Closed captions are also used in public environments, such as bars, and restaurants, where patrons may not be able to hear over the background noise, or where multiple televisions are displaying different programs.[1][2][3]      [edit] Television and video  For live programs, spoken words comprising the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a Speech-to-Text Reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text by a computer and displayed on the screen. This technique was developed in the 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service.[4] In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, American Idol, and other live shows fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear.[5] Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003 the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast.    In some cases the transcript is available beforehand and captions are simply displayed during the program after being edited. For programs that have a mix of pre-prepared and live content, such as news bulletins, a combination of the above techniques is used.    For prerecorded programs, commercials, and home videos, audio is transcribed and captions are prepared, positioned, and timed in advance.    For all types of NTSC programming, captions are "encoded" into Line 21 of the vertical blanking interval  a part of the TV picture that sits just above the visible portion and is usually unseen. For ATSC (digital televi|`|j7rBM2yTaa	CCTV means "Closed Circuit TeleVision". This is an old term to mean television that is is not broadcast.

de3ENQdNaa	You can always buy subwoofers seperately.    For your specific situation, you'd really be far better off buying a new set of speakers though.    Here's what you have to do to hook up that soundbar, since it's only got a 1/8" plug built-in.    Buy a powered subwoofer with it's own built-in crossover and line level outputs for regular speakers. This can be a bit hard to find, especially cheap enough to make it worth your while in this case.    Buy a 1/8" to RCA plug adaptor. About 8 bucks at RadioShack.  Buy a set of RCA cables. Also about 8 bucks at RadioShack.    Plug the adapter into your line out on your computer and then run the RCA cables from there to the sub.    Buy an RCA to 1/8" female adaptor (The exact opposite of the one from above) and plug the RCA ends into subwoofer.    Plug the Soundbar into the 1/8" female end of that adaptor. I suspect you'll also need a 1/8"-1/8" cable since the sub will be sitting on the floor and the cable coming out of the soundbar may not reach. If that's the case, that's another 8 bucks.    Or instead of all that, you could just buy a decent 50 dollar speaker/sub rig and save yourself all the hassle. :)    But if you really want, that's how you could do it!|`|uPPONxIVaa	well you dont have to catter to the computer. you can buy home audio equipment or car audio equipment and it will all work on your computer. prolly home because car equipment would require a large 12 volt converter. all the stereo needs is an auxillary input for you to plug the output from the computer in.

You spoke of buying a TV with a tuner (which is only needed for over the air broadcasts) but if you are seeing channels like 98.804, then I suspect you are really on cable. No one is going to be able to tell you what channel USA network is on unless you tell us the cable provider.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	That is a cable channel, and probably encrypted.    There are no formally published QAM tuning lists.|`|1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	Just go to http://www.antennaweb.org. Click on "choose an antenna" and provide your address. It will provide you with all the analog and digital stations in your area and tell you what direction they are in, how far away they are and how difficult they will be to receive.    You can also use this to get suggestions for what size antenna you need to pick up these stations.
HekFanRvaa	yeah, could really be an interference and you've already proved it when you disconnect the box. Just leave the box connected and turn the power off or unplug it from the outlet the prevent interference.
ilScrvPEaa	STAY AWAY from those coolers. Instead of cooling PS3, they block the internal cooling system. The temperature will rise - PS3 will overheat. It's a total rip-off.|`|FIL4vngsaa	Not really. Because the PS3 has about 3-4 fans and an external fan might block something and make it overheat and fail.  Just make sure your PS3 is well ventilated.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	no because i heard that they someimes cause alot of problems|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	NO!!! I CANNOT stress this enough. It will void your warranty, because the cooler is taking up more electricity than Sony officially permits, and most of the coolers break the PS3's internal fans, because they spin in one direction and the cooler's fans spin in another. SO DON'T DO IT!!!    Oh yeah, and there is really no need for you to buy one anyways, the PS3's stock coolers are much more effective. My friend left his PS3 on for almost 15 hours (without cooler) , and his still works fine.|`|mPaqhgUuaa	Depends on how long you leave your PS3 on. If you plan on gaming for over 8 hours, a cooling fan will be a good option. But if you're just a casual gamer, and you have enough room between the PS3 and the wall, I guess you're fine.|`|raEUval8aa	OK, everyone stop.    It does not void your warranty.    But also, it doesn't matter because you SHOULD NOT BUY ONE. The PS3 does not have any of the horrible overheating problems like a certain other console......buying a cooler actually increases your risk for overheating. It diverts power to power the cooler, causing power gaps to break and the system to become confused and overwork itself, thus overheating and dying.|`|pl2SocVKaa	well yes if you don't play it in a cool area or play for a lot of hours in a row|`|6rWolcZBaa	if you play for more than 4 hours at a time then yes, because it may over heat and cause damage and you would never know until it stopped working one day.|`|d4slGQG5aa	Yes otherwise it can overheat if you leave it on too long, and set on fire, lol. Don't they already come with a built in one though?|`|hUkKQv2aaa	yes my cousins had theirs on for 5 hours and it stopped working and had to buy a new console so if you dont want to buy a new one buy a cooling fan less money to spend|`|ZoXCW6knaa	It's cheap insurance . Do you absolutely need it ,  no , but ps3 and xbox 360 run notoriously hot, so why not spend $20 on you what $600 machine, that is a good insurance investment .    Woah, edit .  The absolute best is an open tv stand with as much open space all around it . But if you have an entertainment center that restricts air flow or have a lot of other electronics near it giving off heat, THEN the cooling fan is a good option. Sony I'm 99% sure makes one under their name ,find the one made by them not some knock off brand|`|NRhrO833aa	If you Can find any Extension that cools down a monster system like that then the answer would be yes, depending on how much you play. However, you should also consider things like creating a book ramp under it, keeping it away from wall and carpet etc.. But playing for over 4 hours though, you may want to alleviate some bad habits, like long pauses. Hope this answer was good enough :).|`|nm9HTpBgaa	No it will void your warranty. Trust me.  PS3 can handle it, I have one and it endures more than my Xbox 3-Fix-Me|`|oTWnXvFxaa	Nope.  It might be worth it to buy it for a 360 because they have crappy hardware but you don't need one for the PS3 because they don't break easily.  I had mine on all night multiple times and nothing happened to it.
LVbF00iAaa	if you have a password wep for your wireless internet connection then you have to type it in in order to access it on the psp|`|q41rXa1Taa	Just update the system with a newer UMD game. It should have a later version of the firmware with the internet browser on it.
dpRQeob8aa	A PS3 Error 8002F997 signifies an XMB Update Error. A lot of people with FW updates have problems. An easy, although time-consuming way to solve this is to backup/format your HDD and then re-install the Update.
HekFanRvaa	Did he get it as brand new or pre-owned?  40GB is quite an old and obsolete system  and he has to download the firmware update first (the current is version 2.60). Maybe that's the problem. Hook it up to the internet and try to download the update first before calling Sony. The number to call is 1-800-345-7669. 1 yaer Sony warranty is valid for 1 year from date of purcahse ( for free repair or replacement incl free shipping). I hope he still has the receipt. otherwise, the warranty will be void without it.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	The Sony warranty is 1 year after the original date of purchase. I would tell him to download the latest firmware update (2.60)    I think he pressed a button that automatically signs in for him, that's probably why.    I would call Sony as a last resort, if the other two methods don't work.|`|KLtxLzJQaa	The same stuff keeps happening to me(the screen color),but this last one...you need to call a Sony Playstation store,and tell them that your reading laser is broken.They will tell you when to come and they will replace your laser in a month or so(depends how much spare lasers they have,and how many Playstations they have to repair).
s7Muujxzaa	On a computer motherboard, it will be an output.|`|e4hMIUGCaa	It is an output port,used to connect to a wide screen lcd tv which also have hdmi port.You can then enjoy a bigger screen to watch video or work your sheets.
RpCwfcRzaa	No. You can't sell accounts and you can't advertise them here.
HVQFVtelaa	A home stereo speaker would end up with fried midranges and tweeters if used for rock guitar, but the type of components used in a guitar or night club speaker would have a better low end, and mid to high end clarity at low volumes for your stereo music. On your budget you could replace the old components in "thrown away" speaker cabinets with pro grade components. Google search "Eminence speakers" to find any size guitar speakers, then add a horn midrange tweeter for the best high end clarity. Piezo electric horns sound great and are almost unblowable, and simplify the crossover network.
HekFanRvaa	restart the PS3.. it's just a read disc error.. if it didn't work.. reset it.|`|vQXGtkyWaa	i hav a ps3 sorry cant really say how to fix this is there i little spinning wheel thing in the top right corner of yr screen if so then it is reading the disks.if not then it isnt reading them.ether way if its not showing u the game icon so u can play then u need to ring sony and get a new one sent out.hope this helps some.|`|4dVuAoAPaa	make sur the cd is clean|`|zZBIxGbHaa	this happened to me with gta 4    i checked the disc and found tht at the ring in the middle there was a small crack stopping the disc from being read  all you can do is trade it in at the nearest game shop but remember dont mention its broken
FSRSYEHXaa	unplug your internet router so it should be off and have no power and wait like 30 secs then plug it back in and try it|`|hxZRR4uUaa	i plugged everything out of my xbox waited a minute plugged it in and i mean unplug everything and it works usually
KFW0tDwsaa	Yes you can.  There is an internal splitter on the OTA input.  I have an HR20-100 HD DVR and just verified that 2 OTA HD channels will record at the same time.  I believe the AM21 add-on also has the internal splitter.|`|fWMat3xwaa	only one ota channel can be recorded at a time|`|s7Muujxzaa	Good question to which I do not know the answer. I am assuming that you have your over the air antenna connected to the antenna connection on the back of the satellite receiver, which is the only way for this to work. I have just tried to record one channel (which was one not one carried by Directv) and found that it recorded fine.
RpCwfcRzaa	Unfortunately, no. You need a hard drive to connect to Live now because of the update. Microsoft has a program that offer Arcade owner's a chance to upgrade to a hard drive for cheap. They offer a used 20 GB hard drive for $30. Go here https://www.xboxstorageupgrade.com/hh/we... to enter the program. Or you can try to find a used one at Gamestop or on ebay.|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	do the hard drive upgrade from microsoft NOW,AS IT ENDS TOMORROW!    THE LINK HAS ALREADY BEEN POSTED
Q9SjNzbYaa	plug your 360 in to your network sign in with your 3000 account and press the big middle button and click join live, this will make it so you make an account that takes over your existing local account.    so yes you must make a new account meaning you need to pay for live again. (i pay monthly since i love talking shitt and get banned every so often)
b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	either you or him have family settings turned on that do not allow communication.  Check with your parents or tell him to, so that you can discuss why that setting is enabled
F2jOzkmTaa	do what i did, send in xbox, get new one later, sell, buy ps3|`|SQXpjPdkaa	microsoft allowed a bunch of faulty xbox360's on the market.|`|AA11168144	ha ha should have got a ps3|`|TWoe3D51aa	I've been hearing about this quite a bit. Recently my Xbox has been running really strange, I get constant messages when im playing that ive signed out of messenger. Also it removes me from parties all the time for absolutely no reason. I think the update is really screwy. Strange thing is kicking me out of parties and messenger would be because i have a bad connection, but when i play any online games my connections is always 100% or Green. I'd blame the red ring pandemic as you call it on the update.|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	actually the big thing thats been happening lately is the e 74 error, thats been happening since the nxe came out
UVncUmpNaa	There is no way that it can break the ps3.. that'ss juss silly. if it wouldbreakk when you did that sonywouldn'tt have made it so you can do that.|`|nAN7lb6Gaa	Well, I think I am a bit like your husband ( only in comparison to the controllers issue...LOL ).    I too use only the controllers to turn off my PS3. BUT that's not because, it will break or something,...its just because, even IF something happens to the buttons, then let it happen to the controllers'.    But sometimes there are cases, like say if a game gets stuck in between; ( sometimes it happens ), then you have to restart the console by pressing the turn on/off button for ten seconds. In such conditions the control, or BD remote or anything else don't work, I have tried it all. The only way is to restart it by pressing the turn off button.    So really, I think, the PS3 really doesn't break from such things....|`|oTWnXvFxaa	Hahaha where did your husband hear that from?  That's the only way I turn mine off, I barely ever use the controller to turn it off.  I don't think Sony would be stupid enough to let that happen and if they were, wow.|`|wPKUl3CTaa	I have had a PS3 for 2 years I turn it off manually all the time works perfectly fine so it does not matter any way you turn it off
dNrDhzkHaa	I would say Mario or Yoshi are the best ones, I mean look at the other characters:    Peach:  Gets kidnapped by a fat turtle, no way to defend herself  Bowser:  Can't beat a plumber, even though he has spiked armour and breathes fire.  Sadly Bowser only beats Mario 1/5 times when Mario is made out of paper!  Bowser Jr.:  Still can't beat Mario  Luigi:  A green, skinny version of mario that is scared of his own shadow.  In Super Paper Mario it is shown that he is the exact opposite of cool (No joke)  Waluigi:  An evil form of Luigi...need I say more?  Wario:  He's probably one of the better ones, since he is just an evil version of Mario  Daisy: ...Is the point of Daisy just to give Peach a break, and become Luigi's first girlfriend?  Toad:  A side character that walks around all day with a mushroom on it's head.  Toad's never seem to do much, except give random conversation in games.    At least Mario wins 90% of the time, and Yoshi always kicks butt whenever he teams up with Mario.|`|o8NVWaJgaa	I would have to say, Luigi is first, Bowser is second, and Yoshi is third.  Luigi is the brother and no one really paid attention to Luigi until they found out his jumps were so high. Bowser is awesome too. No one gives him enough credit, I mean, how does he capture the Princess without anyone trying to save her? Yoshi is third because I had fun jumping and sacrificing him in Super Mario World.  But on  the very bottom of my list is Toad, because he in the original was in the castle instead for 7 entire world!|`|ncCWnApDaa	To me its Bowser, Its great to be able to play as him as he does a lot of damage be it in Brawl or one of the RPG games, wish he had at least one game of his own, Luigi does, Princess Peach does and Wario has a few, but none for Bowser.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	Other than mario its King Boo    main character would have to be Yoshi.|`|jxoZdce7aa	mario , princess peach ,or yoshi|`|sibSWgRZaa	I would say king boo or bowser jr. I always use them for mario kart wii.
557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	Sounds like you might have it set up for surround sound mode.  Set the audio for stereo instead and the vocals should come out.
v8gSMx2kaa	i have one but dont waste your money. get this.http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q...  it is so much better. the 360 adapter is overpriced and not that good.|`|enWGuc6taa	The wireless adapter works just like  a regular laptop with wireless capabilities.  Our router is on the main floor, I'm guessing probably a good 40 feet away from where our Xbox is hooked up. So where ever you read this, isn't correct.  I also have a Linksys router and it works just fine.  What type of wireless adapter do you have? The microsoft one, or a generic brand?      That's the same one I have.  It works well...I don't really trust generic brands, I'd go with the Microsoft one just to be sure it works best.  Also, most generic brands are priced within the same range.
w4I9oj2Maa	You might want to check the PS-3's audio settings first..if you are NOT SET to PCM, then that may be the reason you get the crackle...    The other possibility is the Game itself...Since you state the Game works fine on your STANDARD LOW DEF TV SET, maybe that game was designed for Low Def, and not Hi Def operation.    You did state "it only happens on that game"  and I believe your other games work fine, SO THAT would make me believe the TV and the   PS-3 are working fine. It's just the game failing...  If you are using the HDMI output, try the game on the COMPONENT output, since that is the same sound as your STANDARD TV USES...  You could even try the LOW DEF signal that works fine on your Standard TV and plug it into your HDTV set.    Connecting your Surround system using the same exact connectors that cause the crackling on your TV set would isolate the problem to the PS3, or the TV set at least...
OcfL1QNcaa	There are two demon fox types in the game, and one cursed seal form for Sasuke.    The first nine tailed demon fox form occurs when you use down + jutsu as Naruto when you have 40% health or less. (sometimes, it *seems* you have to have a little less than that, the game seems to be a little picky.) You do not need to do anything special to unlock this.    There is a transforming cinematic that occurs when you do a 2 character vs match, if you select regular Sasuke/Cursed seal Sasuke as a team, or regular naruto/Ultimate nine tailed naruto. When your 'regular' character dies, you go into a cinematic, in which Sasuke releases his cursed seal, and reaches form 2, or, in Naruto's case, he DBZ's it up, screams, and releases the nine tails' chakra.    In order to UNLOCK these characters, you must have 50% completion or more for their missions. (Naruto and Sasuke) (Some websites say you must have done the first three, and the last 2 missions,  but I apparently did not have to?)     Simply completeing missions does not gaurentee you 50%. For instance, you can do all 10 missions at Jounin level and you will NOT have 100%. You can check in your data (the same place where character statistics, win/loss, etc are) your mission completion for your characters. Each character has 10 missions, and in order to get 100% completion (10% per mission), you must complete their missions at Hokage level.    Alternatively, you can fight a certain number of battles to unlock the characters. For Ultimate Nine Tails Naruto its 750, and for Second State Sasuke, it is 800.     The transformation sequence (cinematic) for these two forms only occurs when playing a 2 character battle with the aforementioned team. Note that when doing this, you don't get the 'team jutsu' ability that you use (foward + jutsu, when both team members are at full chakra) with these pairings. I have not yet tried this with Awakened Hinata, but I'm fairly sure it will be a similar thing.|`|r7tzJLEPaa	to transform into narutos demon fox you need to have lost at least 40% of your health(when your health bar turns orangish) and you have to have a full bar of chakra, with those 2 you have to hit down on the nunchuk and wii remote at the same time...  to get sasuke to use sharingan, all you have to have is 1 bar of your chakra gauge full and then hit down on the wii remote and nunchuk(like in narutos fox form)...    hope i helped ^^
HL1t2OhDaa	.Go with the sony! Sony make the best TVS. People say that they are over priced but there not. The fastest tv broadcast in is 120hz. Almost all Sony's can handle over 120hx which means there tvs have Technology that's not even out yet. Especially if you buy an Sony HDNA which all can handle over 200hz! Also sony have high powered processors to enhance the pitcher. Then for Lcd or plasma the choice of which plays better it up to the buy. Personally i would go with LCD they last longer and look better to me. Go with the sony. If your wait a little while longer Sonys TVS will be 1440p ready which is the next type of pitcher after 1080P. Another example of future technology in sony TVS. Sonys best TVS are there higher end Tvs which are their bravia's and then the best is HDNA.    Also if your not in a rush to buy one i would wait until sony releases there line of OLED or organic light emitting diode. These TV's are next generation of TVS. They are as thick as one inch and smaller. Even a 50in or higher tv will be less then 2inches thick. They have nearly double the amount of colors as TVS now and are just amazing.    Sony's also making a 3-d TV which will not be out for a while but you will not need glasses. They use TECHNOLOGY that bends the light until our eyes process it and we see it as 3d. But you can wear 3-d glass to get a better effect.|`|3RCdVPsAaa	Have you thought about getting a Samsung? Everytime I think of a good TV its Samsung and they are always are the brighter one in the store! I have a 63" Samsung and a Blu-ray player hooked up right now and the clarity it great, crystal clear. I usually complain about things like that! Far as unconverting your blu-ray will do that for you. No more HD dvds just blu-ray. I'm not much for Xbox but it shows blu-ray well it should for Xbox just as good?  When buying something like this cheaper is not always better! So when looking don't just look at the size, look farther into it!|`|sER6UGMWaa	your better off going plasma its a better technology vtkinger that 63 he has is a plasma... plasma is overall better than the lcd technology|`|0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	Sony is better.

Izbp5nLBaa	you need to calm down,ok first hold the middle and the menu bottom until you see the apple sign,it should come up,if it does not then you need to maybe take some rice and put the ipod in it so that if there was any water damage then the rice can suck it up and out the ipod,leave it like that for a day or 2 if that fails then your ipod is damaged,call the apple tec help and tell them that your ipod is not coming on,don't say anything about your sister had it and what not because you want if fixed right,tell them that you stopped listening to it and then after that you set it down on the charger and you came back and the light did not work,they will have you send it in if the warranty is still good,you will have it fixed and then after that you will just have to replace all your songs      i wish you the best of luck|`|5ktSlNodaa	Contact apple support|`|WXO67wNDaa	i dont know...i dont understand which light was black...if i knew i might be able to answer|`|hd442Ha5aa	First of all you should calm down.

bj5Hq83uaa	ok pros of nanos.   1. i have one lol  2. they are smaller and more compact  cons  1. cant put apps on them  2. has basic music/tv shows/movies/games  3. smaller screen  4. not touchscreen!  pros of itouch  1. touch screen  2. can put apps on it  3. internet access  4. kinda like a mini cpu  cons  1. bigger  2. only comes in black  3. cant normally fit in pocket|`|1LpDjvlIaa	get the itouch  i have one with like 350 song and 2 movies and a couple tv shows/music videos! It is longer/bigger but is really thin. me and my brother have ipod touches and they are more fun cause they have games(also called apps) they are very entertaining and worth the money!|`|fZqvuKHuaa	I'd say get the ipod nano, because its compact and would hold all of the songs you want on it. The touch would drive me crazy with all the fingerprints on it!    Maybe just get a mobile phone with wifi internet access and applications next time you feel the need to upgrade. You'd probably pay a heap more for ipod touch and then you probably wouldn't use the internet on it as much as you think, because generally it's always going to be better on a pc screen :)|`|Wg0dHXgPaa	go to www.tinydeal.com and i think you gonna change your mind     vote for me :)))|`|fHPlmdW0aa	If I were you I would get the I-pod touch. Trust me it is way good.=)|`|je7l6ewIaa	... u can just get the 8gb ipod touch, i had an ipod touch and ipod nano, the nanos been in my desk for the last 4 months, the ipod touch has been out of my hand for 5 minutes... it will fit in your jacket fine and ull love it... well thats all goodluck|`|5dNGyKTNaa	i have an ipod touch and i love it and think its AWESOME...but i would rather have a nano because they are sooo colorful and they definatley are smaller than the ipod touch but you can put movies and videos on an ipod touch... hmm i would go with a nano? idk|`|hLCk5p0paa	I just bought the new iPod chromatic in purple, and i'm kinda wishing i bought the touch. Just go to the store and try it out !(:    If you are gonna watch videos on the iPod nano, make sure you get 16gb, because the videos take up a lot of room.&like, if mine just moves, the songs change b/c of the shuffle shaking feature, so you have to put it on hold, then it won't change. However, it has really good battery life.     The touch is probably bigger. You'd probably wanna get some sorta case for the front i'm guessing.    They are both really good i hear ! just choose the one that would work best for you:]|`|9APoQiSQaa	i personally think that you should buy an ipod because i hear that ipod touches are cool and all, but aren't very good for multiple reasons. i would also get as much room as possible on your ipod 'cause i got a 4g for christmas '07 and it's almost full and i dont have all that much on there i wish i had gotten an 8g|`|k4DxnbMCaa	Well with the iPod touch, you are given access to a lot more downloadable content. The apps found in the iTunes store are pretty useful, and will help extend the capabilities of your iPod Touch. On the other hand, the iPod Nano is cheaper, and smaller. However, the Nano has fewer capabilities due to its inability to use the apps. In my opinion, the iPod Touch is the better way to go, if you can spare the extra money.|`|nAN7lb6Gaa	Get the iPod Nano 8GB.    This is because I have second generation Nano 2 GB (can you believe it? But I am not such a music buff, so...)  Bu the thing is, even if you want to put about 2000 songs in your iPod, 8GB will be more than sufficient.  Of course there are things like the touchscreen, but I personally don't like touchscreen so much, and anyway, the Nano fourth generation has very good looks to it,...    So, if you like looks, want only music, especially if you have less music than 1000 songs in your bag, I will say go for iPod Nano.  That's because, its your brother's taste, that he has got an iPod touch. You like Nano, just get a Nano, there really wouldn't be anything to miss, if you want it only for music...  If you want to have the touchscreen, or if you think you may envy your brother later (somehow I think even that is a possibility for you to go for the iTouch), don't think, take the iTouch.|`|stqRSCfwaa	well try carrying ur brother's touch around, see if u have problems, see if u think its to large or pretty gd, altho i hav to admitt if ur brother breaks his touch, he'll probably take yours :P

ufAvoY2Faa	I thought it was pretty good, especially because it is the Super Bowl.    I already told you what I thought of GoW3 being delayed.    I can't wait for the RE5 demo. I'm actually looking forward to the demo more than the Super Bowl, lol. Packers aren't in it so I really could care less.    Can't wait for Killzone 2. I should be getting it on release date.     Oh and I think it's good that Sony is finally starting to market the PS3 more. On that same note, awhile back I got an advertisement in the mail from Sony advertising there official headset. I just think it's great that there really trying to make PSN better. And 1 month later, I got that headset :)|`|UphoLYGYaa	so sony's marketing answer is to spend 3 million to advertise one game...interesting.  far as the reviews go, Playstation official  reviews aren't credible. the game looks promising, but i'm still renting it first.|`|AA10631868	Yeah, Sony really needed to get started with the expensive ad campaigns to draw more attention to its console and games, something that MS has been doing for a while, especially in the last Holiday season, where it managed to consequently beat the PS3's lead on number of consoles sold in Europe. That was the only region where the PS3 used to lead, but Xbox360 stole it away through MS' cunning ad campaigning strategy.     But now Sony is also doing a 2.8 million ad campaign in Europe for Killzone2 specifically :) FInally Sony is reaching out to the audience and there is no doubt that they're on the right track to getting the PS3's sales going up faster than ever.    I think this is just the beginning in 2009, as Sony has a most impressive line up of new bound-to-be blockbuster games for this year.

02lcuxyzaa	A torrent is basically a way to get files transferred faster because it takes a load off of one particular server and downloads parts of the files from different servers. As far as the torrents they are not illegal. But a lot of the files /software and music that are transferred with them are .

VOSyb1fcaa	No. You need a Gamecube controller to play and a memory card to save your data.    Places to plug these in can be found under flaps on the top of the Wii.    Here's links to a memory card and gamecube controller from the Nintendo online store and amazon. You can also try and look in electronics stores, most still have a few:    http://store.nintendo.com/webapp/wcs/sto...    http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-454969505...|`|BMConIedaa	No.  When you start up a Gamecube game, the Wii goes into a "gamecube mode," and turns off all Wii-specific features.  No access to the Wii system memory (so you have to use a Gamecube memory card), no Bluetooth (so you can't use a Wii remote), and no Wifi (so you can't go online, not that there were that many online gamecube games).|`|CcJdEaRpaa	No you will need a gamecube remote.  You can play some wii games with the gamecube remote|`|C7rV71Cjaa	No you need to use a Gamecube controller that is the only control method. You also need a GC memory card to save data.|`|ml18bPFCaa	Sorry that will not work wii is made for wii|`|dNrDhzkHaa	No you can't, since gamecube games aren't designed to be interactive like Wii games are.  You can still use Gamecube games for some Wii games though.  If it was possible you would probably need the nunchuk, since most Gamecube games use a control stick

The moment you plug the iPod in the new computer, it will say, the iPod seems to be synched with some other library, do u want to sync it with this one?  Select no or cancel, or whatever that's appropriate for you. Then copy everything you have in the old computer in a CD or a pen drive and paste it in your new computer, and just make the iTunes in your new computer the same as the old one.  Then you just have to change the library the iPod gets synched with. It happens automatically, when you choose to sync it with the new computer's iTunes.|`|CYT66pSiaa	You need iPod to PC Transfer to transfer your songs/videos to computer,try Cucusoft iPod/iPhone to PC Transfer   it is a very handy tool for windows user to transfer music songs, playlists, video files   and more from ipod to computer.

lEYrs02Raa	DO NOT format your card.  This will erase it.  Your pictures are on the card, its just that you may be encountering software problems.  First try downloading your photos without software, meaning try using a card reader:  http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2009/01...    If you open the drive with a card reader, and the files are still invisible, the next step is to use recovery software to download your photos from the card onto your computer:  http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12...    And finally, only after you've recovered your photos onto your computer, and backed them up, is it now time to consider formatting your card.  This is what likely caused the problem in the first place (Did you ever format your card when you first got it?  Didn't think so.)  An unformatted card will work at first, but eventually will corrupt as you've noticed.  Formatting it should help prevent this from happening again, but again it will also erase the card.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	ask in COMPUTERS|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Just use a card reader.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	When you insert the card into the card reader, you should see a file folder.  When you click on it you will see another folder and after clicking on it, all your image files will show up.  Then all you have to do is copy them to your computer.    The fact that your card can hold 2000 pictures, may mean that you are not using your camera at its highest resolution ... which is a shame, because I am sure you bought a good camera with a good sensor with a lot of pixels on it and to reduce the cameras resolution is sort of a waste of money.|`|UVncUmpNaa	Did you format your card to your camera?
Rmtfm7qnaa	It depends on the camera. Most newer cameras have a digital out plug that you can hook into your USB slot on your computer. If it's a regular tape camera (VHS), then you'll have to either buy a video capture card for your computer or pay a video rental place to burn it onto a DVD (some have that service available, so you might have to shop around).

Try checking a store that sells video games such as EB Games, since they sell used discs, who knows maybe someone sold them just the disc.  The only other place to check is places like EBay, or you could contact Nintendo and ask about buying just the disc.  If none of these work you will either have to wait until one of those options work, or buy the entire Wii Fiit set again.
AA11099584	no not on the ipod itself but they have new head phones that r coming out that have a mic on them with volume Control|`|1IVT7ClCaa	the answer is no|`|wOUxFjIIaa	The new iPod Touch 2nd Gen does NOT have a built in mic. However there are many compatible external mics.    For details go to: http://TouchMic.com    That site specializes in mics for iPod Touch. (i got mine there)    Ocarina will not install on the iPod Touch as the developer limited the installs to the iPhone. Im sure it would work on the iPod Touch if the developer allowed it, however they don't want to handle customer service for all the people that would be asking about a compatible iPod Touch Mic.

nAN7lb6Gaa	Just one tip:  DON'T, i repeat, DON'T plug it to the computer before installing itunes, I did it, and had to try all sorts of thing for two days, till I reset it.  Yeah so, if you want to reset it, press the middle button and the upper scroll together for ten seconds. It will just restart, like a computer restarts. No memory loss, or anything like that.
fLYMqZ8zaa	No, you almost definately do not need a driver disc for the MP4 player. By formatting it, you may have deleted the information the MP4 needs to run. Try switching it on without the USB cable connected and if it works ok, you should be alright. If it doesn't, you may have a faulty unit and should send it back to the seller for a refund/replacement.    If it works, Open it in 'My computer' and browse all the folders on the MP4 until you find one called 'songs'. Open it and also open the folder with all the songs u want on the MP4, select them all and paste them into the folder called 'songs' on the MP4 (the folder could also be called sounds/music etc)    I have added some files to MediaFire that should be the correct drivers (from a player I got from ebay- turned out you do not need the drivers for it to work). The link is in Sources. You need to download all the files in the folder to the same place on ur pc and doulbe-click 'SETUP.EXE'    Good luck!|`|ojCdRHGHaa	some mp4 players do need the disc. mine didn't, and i have a sansa fuze. it mite have something to do with whats on your computer.
fWMat3xwaa	you cant bypass their password, but you could ask them to change the rating options. The problem with filtering shows by the ratings is that  if a movie was released with an R rating then it will still be blocked when its rebroadcast on a network that edits the SC, language, violence. This also applies to PG13, PG or what ever the settings they have selected. I think you will have better luck explaining this to them, then ask them to block the channels that they are concerned about instead of blocking the ratings|`|9RH0Qa6eaa	Try combinations of your birthday or their birthday or their grandmas birthday.  It'll take a while cause there are a bunch of combinations, but write them down as you go so you know which ones you've tried.  Also, people tend to either use overly simplistic passwords or common passwords over and over and over again.  so try easy ones like 1234 1111 0000 etc.   After like ten tries I think it blocks you out for an hour or something, so keep at it!

I can't believe a Japanese console doesn't have that many, or that many upcoming good ones. And the PS2 had tons.

ofpmRvHpaa	Thats actually good.  Under-powering speakers is actually what destroys them.    Think of a car: It has an engine to speed the car up. It has breaks to stop.    A speaker uses the amp to both speed up and break.  Not having enough power is like having no breaks and the speakers ... smash into things.    That "120 watts per channel" is somewhat suspicious.  Make sure that power is measured using 8 ohm speakers and that the power is RMS power.    Some amps 'enhance' their power numbers by using 4 ohm speakers and measuring peak power instead of average.|`|ZWHZto1Baa	You should be fine.  The real world rating of that amp is probably closer to 70-90 watts anyway.

86C2NDIcaa	My favorite game, personally, is Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility.     I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Harvest Moon series, but this one is definitely the most elaborate and definitely the best.    You can choose to be a boy or a girl, instead of having to buy two separate games like in the past games. Of course, you can do all kinds of farming and ranching fun. You can also get married and have a child.     I love this game just because of all the things that you can do. There are many different crops to grow, and you'll get stronger as you keep playing. There are many wild animals that you can befriend...and they will become your pets. There are also a variety of different animals that you can raise on your farm, as well as different colors. There are cows, sheep, horses, goats, chickens, ducks, silk worms, and ostriches. You can actually even ride your ostrich.     Of course, I'm probably not making this game sound like any fun... It's the whole experience of the game that's just amazing. There are so many different places and people to discover...it's amazing. It's definitely my favorite Wii game.    I also like...  Wii Fit  Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Mario Kart  The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess    I'm sure you'll find a great one though. There are so many out there. :)|`|0JV3tQm8aa	Mario Kart  Super Smash Brothers Brawl  Super Mario Galaxy  Animal Crossing City Folks  Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess|`|CcJdEaRpaa	What type of games are you into?

Plus it's simple gameplay features are easy and fun to use.    My favorite gameplay feature is playing your own mp3 music from your SD card    You can listen to music by turning on the radio on your boat, then you can select your mp3 song. You can listen to your music while on your boat and while you dive. It'll play over again if you don't select another song.    You can also make your player lounge in a chair on the boat to gaze out at the ocean; like a personal aquarium sunset feature.    I'd reccommend your personal favorite music genres and from your favorite artists; find some songs you like to add to your own personal taste while you go on dives. Also Opera songs are better than rock music on this game    Me, I personally enjoy all kinds of genres of music.     You can go on dives, and discover all kinds of species that live in the ovean, to clown fish & blue tangs (like in Finding Nemo), whales, seals, penguins, sharks, and also dolphins.    You discover the animals of the sea by simply petting them with a simple press of the A button on the Wii Remote, and then shaking it. Also you can feed fish, and use an underwater pen, whistle, and camera to take pictures.    You can also find and discover treasure on your dives. You'll definately be working hard to find all 232 species of fish to fill up your encyclopedia, as well as trying to complete all the missions.    You can also play and train with the dolphins, which is also fun! This is performed with the press of the A button and shaking the Wii Remote side to side, "when the Go options appears on the lower part of the screen". You've got to love dolphins for they're like the messangers of the sea! :D    I haven't tried the online, but I think it only works if you register friend codes and you and your friends get online at the same time. You play in the Wi-Fi mode by lowering a gate that's on your boat. It only works though if you have friends registered on your friends list.    Things you can do in Wi-Fi mode: you can dive together, and you can bring your dolphin friends with you on Wi-Fi.    I think I basically covered everything; so all that's left is to rank it.    Gameplay: 4/5 (Easy and simple, not much to do, but worth it!)    Graphics: 5/5 (The ocean really is a beautiful thing, if you enjoy it that is!) :D    Sound: 5/5 (Other than using your own music on your SD card; the music on the game is enjoyable as well. Prayer composed by Secret Garden and performed by Hayley Westenra is like a very good song well suited for the game; if you've seen video previews to Endless Ocean on Nintendo.com.)    It's a wonderfully fantasic game perfect for the diver and ocean lover in you; and it's not bad considering it's for 15 :D    I'd rank it as one of my number one favorite games for the Wii along with Brawl and COD5 , and I'm glad I bought it! :)
wIM3vNtwaa	If the lights appear to be "dancing" around (only 2 on at any time), replace the batteries and for a controller to work on another XBOX, they must be synced    To sync:  1) Turn on the control and XBOX  2) Press the sync button on both the control and XBOX (little white or black button on the front of the XBOX (in between the shoulder buttons on the control))  3) They'll both settle on the same light after a few seconds|`|0d6b29db534bef70e4e4a15be7ce1b86aa	There is a little button on the front of the xbox that you have to hold down while at the same time hitting the controller 'x" key.

Wi9LqYyVaa	Hello?   They are on liquidation. Last time I checked everything was 30% off. If there is any good things still left (unlikely) they will be picked over. However you may get good deals. It will go to 40 even 50% soon so if you want to take a chance, wait; but you may go there and find it empty except for the stuff nobody wants. Try best buy if you cant find something. They have good service.
PVlKAfTHaa	I have both the Roku box, which just plays netflix's online stuff, and an xbox 360, and they both work exactly the same. If you aren't going to play games, just get a Roku since it's less than $99. If you want the added ability to play the games, go with the xbox360. It's a great service, you get your normal movies in the mail, and you can watch a growing library of movies online. The library is constantly growing, as they get the digital rights to do the films that way.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|AA11919432	NO!!! netflix does not offer new releases. only old movies. its reallllly not worth the money per month.

Are you completely unable to join them or do you just get booted when you try to join them?  Also, what speed connection do you have?

Only pictures can be transferred from the Internet. If you having problems getting videos on your PSP period then its a another issue.    For starters, the most iimportant thing you need is a PSP media pack. You can find it in any electronic store, but if you don't have that, its impossible to download videos on your PSP.   If you do have the media pack, go to google videos and try to download a video from there. There will be 2 links in the top right hand corner saying "download to Ipod" and "download to PSP". The video should appear on your "media manager" if you have the media pack. After that just connect a USB cable to the cpu and PSP and click USB connection on PSP and download.   Currently I'm using a media converter to download my PSP content so I can now get videos from wherever I want on the web.
evDPENwUaa	If your PS2 is playing other games fine then you should return the game you bought and tell them that it isn't working properly.  If you just bought it then you should be able to exchange it for another one.    If your PS2 isn't reading any disks then you probably have a laser issue (ie- not moving or stuck) and it would need to be repaired.    Hope that helps.

America got push back to june13     Trust me you'll have a new TV by then.    Most tv now day's have the analog converter built in do a web search of your set.    Most cable cable company do the decoding already so even if you had a really old set it wouldn't matter.|`|f78317157ce3d11dfb85f2d141a4aa76aa	One quick question back? Your TVs would have said digital ready at time of purchase so if there wasn't any info about the tuner then your likely to have analog only TVs  But the real answer is if you are already using a TV provider such as in my area Time Warner they supply and charge a small rent on their receivers. If your using some type of Satellite service you are using a Receiver from there service and don't need the digital tuners.  If your on Rabbit ears or external antenna then you may have to get the infamous Digital converter to receive tv after the transition.  Any more information just go to the DTV websites that can give your more detailed information or just email me if you need a little more info.  Take care and enjoy your TVs.  sincerely joe_13642|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	Yes, you need a converter box or two to get the digital channels that your provider has to offer, and you need to get it from them.    You do not need a converter box because of the digital transition though, for it applies only to American broadcast stations soon, Canadian ones later. In either case, you provider is taking care of the conversion for you. You should still be able to receive analog cable fine for some time to come.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	If you want to drive them fully you'll need 300 watts of power from your amp.  But unless you like extremely loud audio, you don't need 300 watts.  A 50 watt amp should be more than enough.  Make sure you keep the speakers away from your computer.  The magnets in them could corrupt your hard drive or magnetize your monitor if you still have a CRT monitor.|`|AA11061397	Wires' suggestion is ok so long as you don't overdrive the amplifier.    If you do, the amplifier will clip the signal, and the power from the amplifier can increase dramatically - depending on the particular amplifier and its power supply's capacity.      The conventional wisdom is that it is worse to drive a 'speaker from an overdriven and under-powered amplifier than it is to drive it with an correctly driven amplifier which can deliver rather more power than the 'speaker is rated for.

OKg99wqgaa	Polaroid 600 film does not come in black and white as the other answer suggested. This sounds like overexposure of the film to me. This means there could possibly be an issue with the shutter (staying open too long) or you could also try adjusting the aperture which on most Polaroids is a little switch you slide to make it lighter or darker. This affects how the camera adjusts the light level also make sure you don't have your finger covering the little light window below the viewfinder lens on the front of the camera.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	IT'S B/W FILM

Or else he may not know that a PS3 cd is non rewritable, i.e., you cannot write or delete anything on/from it. It will remain just like it is.

It's not so hard to figure out. I think what your brother means that you won't have the save-games one dude has because those are saved to the PS3, not the disk. In this case, you can copy>paste the save file onto another PS3's hard drive, take the disk and play as though on the other dude's PS3 (same level, weapons, name, profile, etc). Or you can always do new game. In other words, the answer to your question is yes.|`|cUxnKzNzaa	kinda a retort able question but nope its not true.....u can use a PS3 game on more then one PS3|`|1aqrRzqLaa	Wow your brother is an idiot.

Oh the SD 1000 seems to have an optical view finder, I think that's good also. Of course it does list for about $150 less than the S5      But the S5 IS is superior in focal length, and aperture size. It also has a hot shoe so you can use an external flash.    Now on the other hand the new SD990 IS, looks interesting! ;)    They both take nice pictures.    But are different sorts of cameras, I have a S5 IS and an older SD630, I usually have the 630 with me all the time, because of it's size. With the S5 IS and several other cameras in my car.

zDNHCvCcaa	That is definitely a fast enough processor for running whatever game it is that you need, but there's a few things you should know.    1)Clock Speed (x amount of GHz) isn't an exact value of how fast your computer's processor is. There's much more to it than that.    2)Even with a fast processor, if you have insufficient RAM or a weak Graphics card, you will run into trouble with a game. Make sure that you meet those specifications.    If I didn't answer your question completely, let me know what game it is that you asking about, and the exact model and brand of your system.    EDIT: In response to Seby's answer:  You are wrong. The recommended processor is a 2.4GHz P4. P4 stands for Pentium 4. The Intel Pentium 4 is a very old processor. Ladytiggon's processor is a 2.0Ghz Core 2 Duo, a relatively new processor.     GHz aren't everything, there's much more to how fast a processor is, such as it's cache, front side bus, floating point, etc etc. The list goes on. The GHz speed illusion came from an arms race between AMD and Intel a while back. The general public got the idea that the more GHz a processor has, the faster it is. This is not true anymore, especially with most dual core processors having many less GHz than single core processors, yet the dual cores are much, much faster.|`|v5Z4wsJhaa	find a better computer

Plasma TV's have very good refresh rate and have no motion blur at all and are cheaper , but some plasma's can get some burn in, but a reputable company for plasma's should be good.

HDMI, you need to check that out if you have one...it could be a USB connection...    The BEST WAY to know for sure....Consult your computer's Instruction manual and look at the page that shows pictures of your connections...    Once you know that you have an output that connects to your TV set, you then have to tell the computer to send the screen to the output, intstead of your display....    Once again, consult your manual...    THEN you have to hook up your Audio to your TV set....

AA11092020	You can do this one of two ways that I know of:    Ripping Blu-ray:    1. Running Linux on a PS3.  Your PS3 drive has to have the space available for the OS installation and the rip, minus whatever else you may install in Linux.    2. DVDFab HD Decryptor or AnyDVD HD will allow you to rip copy protected (AACS) blu-ray movies to your hard drive.    Remember:  you've paid for the right to view the movie, meaning you own the film PHYSICALLY but not the rights to it... therefore, you can do whatever you like ragarding making backups for play on other devices, as long as you do not distribute it... whether for profit or not, or modify it's content.  There is currently a legal battle going on where the RIAA and MPAA are attempting to illegalize copying of movies regardless of intent, but until that is resolved, you can make copies to view however you wish.    Editing:    It's unnecessary to mention the re-encoding step unless you plan to view these movies on a standard DVD player, in which case they will need to be re-encoded to 720x480 MPEG2 files with AC3 Dolby Digital audio.  (if this is the case, you can fit the entire movie onto one disc after re-encoding)    Although, if you plan to view them on a blu-ray player, you do not have to re-encode because the blu-ray player will recognize the HD encoding (1920x1080 MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC, or VC-1) on a standard DVD and play it back as such.    Rather than continue making a long-winded response, I will refer to a website that has further instruction for splitting the movie to multiple parts, then burning to multiple DVDs.  (see link in sources).    I hope this information is helpful.  Good luck.|`|557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	Thats a good question.  You probably could. although it might be tough to do.  First you gotta crack the copy protection and then you have to find a program that would cut up the video into 4.7GB pieces.  If you can to that then I don't see why what you want to do wouldn't be possible.    Good luck.|`|lY5YDFizaa	no they are protected

fWMat3xwaa	when you schedule recordings, the default is to record to TV2 first, a second show scheduled at the same time then goes to TV1. Now the biggest culprit of your issue is the start early ( 1 min ) and the end late ( 3 min ) option. For example: you want to record show "A" from 8:00 to 9:00, Then show "B" from 9:00 to 10:00. Since show "A" is actually recording till 9:03, show "B" then moves to TV1.   Hope this makes sense. To fix this, go to options while setting up a timer and set early/ late options to 0. It will then ask if you want it for this one timer for for all timers, choose all.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	What? I don't follow what you mean. A DVR is just like a VCR or DVD player, in that it outputs signal to a TV. It will record onto the DVR from whatever source you have going into it, such as cable, satellite, antenna, etc. Depending on the set up of your entertainment system, you should be able to have the DVR go to any TV in your home.

UAYzLyN4aa	DLP is less expensive because it's far simpler to make than plasma.     I like my DLP set a lot.     If you absolutely must have a set you can hang on the wall, go for plasma or LCD. If you don't mind putting the TV on a stand (a shallow one, far less deep than a CRT TV), then DLP will give you a similar-looking picture at much less cost.     One thing: Like any rear projection TV there are view angle issues. If you want to be able to watch your TV from far to the left or right of the screen, or above or below, DLP is not for you.|`|w4I9oj2Maa	It's a LOT BETTER...    They don't BURN, they have a BRIGHTER PICTURE, better color Gamut, cost less to repair and has been used by the movie theaters since the 1990's...that technology costs less because the manufacturer has recouped their costs of engineering..    They should last as long as the OLD TVs did....and longer than a Plasma, considering the DLP doesn't age at all...Plasma phosphors do age...growing dimmer over time.|`|dqzoEw67aa	DLP is inexpensive because it is being phased out, Samsung isn't making them anymore so they are being reduced to get rid of them.  Mits will make them for another year or so, but most people want plasma or lcd.    The reason they are being phased out is that they require many more repairs and have lots more problems then LCD and Plasma.  DLP's lifespan is probably max. 5 years, if you are lucky.    If you want a very large screen, get a DLP, the picture is excellent but you may have more problems with it.  If you get the Samsung led dlp, you won't need to buy a bulb every few years, if you buy a bulb one, you will.  The bulbs cost about $150 and who knows how long they will be available after Sammy gets out of the dlp market.    Plasma also has a good picture and is usually more reliable.  Most everyone who buys a tv at or under 50" goes LCD or Plasma.    But as I said, if you want a really cheap big screen, dlp is worth the risk and it's picture is great.

A4P3ot4xaa	If you still have lots of VHS tapes that are needing transfer-ed to disc another DVD/VCR combi with built in Hard drive and Digital Tuner is the best Solution. Many new ones have High speed dubbing as well allowing faster transfer of tapes to disc or Hard drive. Making sure that you get an Up-scaling model will help future proof it to. I have found that Higher the spec and Make Model will also help. A Sony one is better than a cheapish one thus the better you get the more straight forward to use it can be.<br>  Buying a Camcorder with a ability to link to your PC only allows transfer of camcorder stuff to Pc and a link to any TV or recording equipment.

Iklgy3T7aa	Blu-ray Disc (also known as Blu-ray or BD) is an optical disc storage medium. Its main uses are high-definition video and data storage. The disc has the same physical dimensions as standard DVDs and CDs.    The name Blu-ray Disc is derived from the blue laser (violet-colored) used to read and write this type of disc. Because of the wavelength (405 nanometres), substantially more data can be stored on a Blu-ray Disc than on the DVD format, which uses a red (650 nm) laser. A two-layer Blu-ray Disc can store 50 gigabytes, almost six times the capacity of a two-layer DVD, or ten and a half times that of a single-layer DVD.|`|YIW1KIi6aa	The EMMA 3PF is the first large-scale integration (LSI) chip to pack all of the necessary Blu-ray controllers onto a single piece of silicon.

AA11068631	If the videos are WMV files then you can simply drag and drop them.  Download the video to the desktop, open the player's storage device folder, then the video folder, then drag and drop the video from the desktop to the video folder.  Then disconnect the player, allow it to create its library, open the video folder and watch your video.    If the video you want to watch is a different format, then you'll need to convert it to WMV.  I've not done this for my player (the same model as yours) but I know there's a program called Media Monkey that may be able to convert the files to WMV files.  I'm not certain though, as I say, I've not tested it.|`|elY5vkVyaa	They have to be in mp4 or WMV format, the media player comes with software to automatically convert WMV's. It's a pain if you're trying to put MOV format videos on it though (MOV is Apple Quicktime) because they are completely incompatible (Microsoft and Apple being arch-rivals) so you have to convert the MOV video to MP4 or WMV which isn't easy.  I think Quicktime Pro comes with a format converter but many free converters will be hit-and-miss.

AA11877492	LOL! Changing from a Samsung to a Vizio IS NOT AN UPGRADE. http://www.hdguru.com/?=107/  If you want an upgrade for a reasonable price, get a 50" Panasonic Viera plasma!!! If you 'think' you need an LCD, look specifically at Sony Bravia, Toshiba Regza, Sharp Aquos, and Samsung, pretty  much in this order, for the best 52" LCDs for BOTH performance and reliability. Stay far away from the cheap, third tier junk TVs assembled from Chinese parts.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	I looked at a Vizio side by side with major name brands and was not at all impressed with the picture.  There was a noticeable difference. Circuit City ramped up to the MSRP and takes 10% off.  So, their TVs are pretty much more expensive than they were before. Go figure.
w4I9oj2Maa	I don't think so...that signal is bad due to excessive distribution of the signal  OR you have a BAD connection to his/her system.    Are you on friendly terms with your neighbor? If so, check how good their signal is first, and see if they are using more than 4 recievers on their line.    If they are also getting a low signal, then it's time to get a TECH out to install a distribution amplifier and make sure the lines aren't shorted internally...the service provider will provide a tech that can fix it.
uapDu8RYaa	Its called a RF modulator. It converts a signal from composite cables (red, yellow, white) to c coaxial cable (the kind cable boxes use).    They sell for $20 at fye. Amazon.com has one for $13. Radio shack will probably overcharge you.

qWicVoU9aa	It won't have a number until you activate it with a service provider.|`|hu5p9k49aa	If you really want to give it back call up the service provider such as Verizon, At&T, or Sprint and give them the serial number... you can usually find that when you take out the battery... They should have all the information on file and let you know who it belongs to...
qWicVoU9aa	Yes, but if it is not paid on the 1st the account goes in to a past due status and is subject to be disconnected for non-payment and the reconnection fee is $36 so which do you think is better?|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	Yes. That's what it means.
TcyaA0Y4aa	You can't it will only separate them by the name of the show.
kknCZkq0aa	I think that's running out a lot faster than mine did. I could go for a week without charging mine, and listened to it at least half and hour a day.     I'm not sure if they need to be sent to Apple to have the battery replaced, but you could probably try Futurshop. They have really good service there, and it's somewhere I would trust my iPod. I don't know where you live, so I cant say if there are any good places around to get it replaced.    I'm also pretty sure you can't replace the back of iPods, but if you could, you would definitely have to go to Apple for it.|`|yrQQ3dJVaa	You could probably go to Apple to get a new one. oh yah and for the back you could brobly just get primer and piant over it|`|AA10639502	That's not normal , you should really get the battery changed, try sending it to Apple & also, the back panel of your ipod, you should definately send that to apple. Lucky you if you warranty isnt up (: .
7KkRkseUaa	go for the pc! obviously you have a tight budget, but you can still build a good gaming pc. what i'd do if i was you would be opt for a dualcore cpu, the new 7750+ black is very good and only about 60. you can use the extra money to upgrade the graphics card you have as it quite frankly rubbish! you should have around 100 for the card which is ok, the 9800GT is about the best you'll get for that money.  oh, make sure you buy a decent cpu cooler too, that 7750 should hit 3ghz+ pretty easy which will give a good boost and out perform the phenom at most things.   good luck!|`|W2YtVUqKaa	first of all i do love the ps3 and the PC but I would invest in the PC just because it's a lot more versatile. and you can mod your games on pc and it's especially good for FPS and if you miss the controller then just get one for the PC|`|DFsR7x12aa	I'm not a PC gamer; i'm only 14 years old and wouldn't be able to keep up with hardware requirements as the only source of income I receive is a 10 pound a week allowance.    Personally, I'd go with the PS3; it's reliable, cheaper than a top quality gaming PC and has better games.     The PC is being neglected by developers due to piracy and due to the majority of gamers, being console gamers (mostly due to the FPS genre which has gained a lot of success from the casual gamer market) ,this is only going to get worse. I feel PC gaming is coming to a stand still.
UjhWIrJ1aa	Yes. First click on the program you want to delete, and it will show you more about the title, such as name, actors, year, and running time. There will be a bar at the bottom with a back button, then play, restart from beginning, lock, and delete. Just click on the X, and it's deleted.
ZkDmJtAsaa	The iPhone 3G has many advantages over current cell phones, most specifically with the web browsing. Most phones use a watered down version of IE (Internet Explorer) that can visit limited websites and you can't do much.    The iPhone comes with Opera, and it allows you to visit virtually any website, including banks (my pet peeve and why I got the phone).    It also has other features, such as GPS (drains the battery fast, however), easy access to email, tons of free games and apps you can download, and is pretty sturdy.      Of course you can watch movies, pictures, songs, etc...    The downside is that the battery sucks- you won't get much more than 1 full day out of it.  It also has no video capability (just a 2MP camera).    ATT is not bad- I have been with them for about 4 years now and no real complaints.    All in all- very useful. My wife and I just went cross country and the ability to visit the full priceline website saved us about $400 over the two weeks.    Worth it.|`|HXPxKEDQaa	THE CALLS ARE OK... BUT THE INTERNET KICKS YOU OFF SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES IT EVEN FREEZES OTHER THAN THAT EVERYTHING IS GREATTTTTTT =]

Then try new batteries again. If that doesn't work see if they're still covered under warranty, and take them back.   Next time you put something in storage always take the batteries out.

AA11259815	Play Grand Prix. Start off at the 50 CC level. Have a 1st place overall ranking in the end, you will unlock the extra levels and bikes / characters as well. It took me 30 hours to receive Gold in all cups including Mirror. Next, you can play Time Trials to unlock characters. For every 8 races you complete, as long as you play the time trials you will unlock characters. If you play Super Mario Galaxy, you will unlock Rosalina. Those are the three easiest methods of unlocking characters / bikes.    Next, to unlock the other characters which are more harder to do, you will want to receive a "Star Ranking" in the cups of Mirror Mode. You are ranked by how you drive. You will notice the ranks range from E-D-C-B-A-star-double star-triple star. You will have a better rank by not falling off the course, staying on the track, trying to drive as perfectly as you can. You dont need to finish first in every race. You will unlock things as you get more star rankings. And the next way to unlock other characters is going back to Time Trials and beating the ghost character by 4-7 seconds.     1) Receive 1st place in all the cups  2) Play the Time Trials  3) Rent Super Mario Galaxy and have it saved on your Wii  4) Receive Star Rankings in Mirror Mode  5) Play the Time Trials and beat the ghost    My opinion on which is the best bike would be "Flame Runner" which is for large characters. This is a popular bike you will see a lot when playing online. It has great speed and great drift (nice combination). As well as weight which will prevent other charcters from bumping into you and pushing you off course. I always used to play the "Quacker" which is a small bike as it has great drift, and great acceleration but is a light weight and slow speed. I noticed when playing the Quacker online, opponents were bumping into me and throwing me off as well as passing me too often. I still do goof with the bike but "Flame Runner" is my top choice.    Tips and Hints ...    Tip  1 ... get an early lead and keep it. I call this technique the "runaway". You see it happen very often online. The key is to get yourself up in first place, every time you get an item box, hold the item behind you to serve as a block. ALWAYS have an item behind you (shell or banana) this is to stop red shells. Have another item as backup. Once you have a blocker and a back-up item, drop the item you have behind you just before you reach another item box. The item boxes are a heavy-traffic route. All players go after the item boxes so lay your items in front of them. Now, once you are in first I call it the "Runaway" because the only thing that can stop you when you are up there is a blue shell. Understand that the middle of the pack is a very dangerous place to be! You will run into a lot of stars, bullet bills, mega mushrooms, 3 red shells, people bumping into you, its very hectic. So being in first, you have nothing to worry about ahead of you and the only person who can get you is the guy in second place (who doesnt receive strong items). And once you are in the lead on Lap 1 the items you drop will spin out the guys behind you giving you an even further lead. So eventually when you are hit by a blue shell, you should still remain in first place. You control the track once you get that runaway lead ... nothing can stop you.    Tip  2 ... at beginning of race when the counter goes 3-2-1, hold down the accelerator shortly after you see the number "2". This will give you a boost. If you start off in first position, do a wheelie during this time and you will be ahead of the pack setting you up for the Runaway (there will be no bananas in front of you while the bananas you drop will affect the players behind you extending your lead).    Tip  3 ... Mushrooms are the key to a lot of shortcuts! On many levels the track will wind around a grass lot, use the mushroom over the grass. On Dry Ruins for example, with the winding mountains, if you receive a golden mushroom, keep tapping it while driving straight and you will practically fly over those mountains and give you an incredible lead.     Tip  4 ... Know the secrets. There are a couple secret shortcuts you can take on some boards. SNES Ghost Valley 2 for example has a secret shortcut. If you look at the map you will see it. Where the item boxes are going around in a circle, dont go that way (to the left). Instead go straight and there will be a little bump allowing you to jump over to the other side.    Tip  5 .. drive behind a player thats in front of you. This will allow a mini turbo if you are behind him long enough.    Tip  6 ... if itemizing 3 bananas, dont drop them in a straight line, and dont drop them where the other players have an open view of them. Drop them as you are turning a corner as the other players wouldnt be able to see them ahead of time, and the bananas will be on the inside - middle - outside of track.     Tip  7 ... just as a POW is about to happen, shake you wheel and you wont spin out. If you receive a B-Bomb, dont hold it behind you cause if another player runs into you, you both blow up. You can dodge a blue shell if you have a mushroom (note that you cant receive a mushroom in first place so it will be rare). When the blue shell is hovering above you, use your mushroom and you will dodge it.    Tip  8 ... when turning a tight corner or if on Rainbow Road, get used to letting up on the accelerator so you dont go off course. The brake is needed on some occassions. I use the brake when Im in second place and a blue shell is about to hit the guy in first in front of me so I dont blow up with him. And I use the brake when I receive that lightning cloud. When turning small, you will lose a lot more ground than the lightning cloud can give you, so you want to pass that off even if having to let someone pass you.

It took me a week to learn but it's much better than auto and you will unlock more stuff. Try using the remote and nunchuck instead of the wheel.|`|BMConIedaa	If you're using the Wii wheel, then try using a control scheme with an analog stick - either with a Nunchuk attachment, the Classic controller attachment, or a Gamecube controller.  The learning curve for the Wii wheel is pretty steep, especially if you're already used to a traditional controller.    There are no cheats in games that Nintendo develops.  At all.    Keep experimenting with bikes and karts until you find one that you're comfortable with.  I like using King Boo with the Shooting Star, myself.

3CJAUyqPaa	It depends on the plane, where you are sitting and whether you bring an appropriate power adapter plug/cable.<br>  <br>  Long-haul planes usually have power receptacles between *certain* seats - Not all rows have them. And you typically won't know if your row has a power receptacle until you get on the plane.<br>  <br>  And the power receptacle is not a regular AC outlet or a 12 volt like in your car - it is airline-specific... Radio Shack and other electronics stores (like Fry's - but most likely not BestBuy) have the converters...<br>  <br>  Check your portable DVD player manual - they generally have a part number for you to get another battery - they are not cheap.<br>  <br>  You would not be recharging on the plane - you would use the plane's power... If you use the battery and all the power is gone after 2-3 hours as you said, then you want to recharge, that will take about 5-7 hours for a full recharge (depends on the poeratble DVD player and battery being chaged). I presume the flight will have landed by then...

You should go and look at them up close, you need to check viewing distances, quality of the screen, you really should go and compare them to each other, sometimes stores put special movies and stuff that look great with one screen and not with other, so it looks really good, but if you put another movie in it might look crappy, so they trick you like that.

Electronics are actually purposely built to only last as long as it's warranty to keep people buying more stuff.<br>  <br>  here's a very short film I animated dealing with the quality of Chinese products, hope you enjoy it<br>  <a href="http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n203/StiggieVandell/BABYEPISODETWO.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n203/...</a>|`|GLJyBe1Jaa	It's a marketing strategy, friend. :P|`|SO7zRZK9aa	Can you elaborate? Mine work just fine.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	I've had my 60GB Apple Ipod Video for more than 2 years now. Never had any problems with it|`|vXa7IeDiaa	I guess they just run their course..And also if they are cheap..
3dT7f39maa	Because the scart lead isn't connected properly, just push it in tight.|`|YgUCXYuxaa	what they said|`|HekFanRvaa	yeah, twas said|`|66ea5837b53a57233ec5c6f5ccc8df36aa	what he said
BwbLmMd2aa	Sales 101. Give something a facelift and it will sell like hotcakes. Take a look at what happened to the Nintendo DS. Functionally it was fine, but it was ugly and kind of bulky. When they came out with the DS lite, sales increased exponentially. One can only assume that LG is after the same goal. They are a business after all.<br>  <br>  One key difference between the new chocolates and the very first generation is the placement of the speakerphone. In the old one it is tucked away on the back (if at all, the very first ones off the line didn't even have speakerphone as it was a firmware upgrade). Other than that they are giving it an aesthetic overhaul in hopes that hype will be generated and translated into sales. After all, who wouldn't be embarrassed walking around with an OLD chocolate (Just a bit of commentary, as I have an old one)?<br>  <br>  They know that style sells. Plain and simple.|`|AA11787200	blue mint and black cherry and they include a 4GB memory card|`|XVXgIafdaa	?????????? (but I just got 2 free points, YAY ME!!)
nay7AO3Daa	They will have to be converted to the 3gp format first. and even then they will be large, take up lots of memory and run slowly
oJJmJTuaaa	You don't need a receipt to send it in.|`|JdXqbWNIaa	Yes I did I few months ago they did not ask me for a reciept, if its in the 3yr warranty period they your fine|`|wIM3vNtwaa	You don't need the receipt. Just send it in in a box with the shipping label attached to it (remember to remove you hard drive, they don't want that) and they'll accept it|`|82EW4cdxaa	Here is the link with all the info you need to send in your xbox, I myself have had to do it twice, but the short answer to your question is yes, you can send it in without the receipt.<br>  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/955906" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/955906</a>
xwSNEYICaa	Yes, there are several games geared for younger kids.  It does help hand-eye coordination.  It can also help with brain development, with the right games.<br>  <br>  Games I would recommend for a young child:<br>  <br>  Wii Sports: Comes with the Wii, games are easy enough for young kids, like bowling, golf, or even tennis.<br>  <br>  Big Brain Academy: Good for developing problem-solving skills.  Many of the challenges are easy enough for a 3 year old.<br>  <br>  Wii Fit: Never to early to exercise. There are several games on Wii Fit that will keep your kids entertained while being beneficial.  It's easy for children, even young ones to figure out.  It also stops a game dead if you jump on it, so you won't have to worry (too much) about them trashing it.<br>  <br>  Carnival Games / Mario Party: Great "party" games that will let you play with your child.  Mario Party will let you choose only "easy" games and you can give your child a handicap so it levels the playing field some.  We used to give my 3-year-old a 2 star handicap so she had a chance of winning.  Just remember to let them win occasionally. =)<br>  <br>  Games geared toward younger kids:<br>  Build-A-Bear Workshop<br>  Disney Princess<br>  Littlest Pet Shop<br>  (I'm sure there are more, these are the ones I have)<br>  <br>  Also, My Sims and My Sims Kingdom - I share a character with my young daughter, I do the building, she runs around and talks to people and changes her clothes.  They are not like regular sims that die if you don't feed/sleep/ect..  They don't need any of the mundane things that the regular Sims games require.<br>  <br>  You will find yourself quite surprised at what your child will be able to do with the Wii.  In my experience (I've had 5 kids), you give a child something you think will be over their head, they will figure it out and be matching your skills, soon enough. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|hwaTOBL7aa	She will love it and she would be able to comprehend it fairly well, there also are some games that you may enjoy. The wii is called the "wii" because it's meant for any one to play it and enjoy it.|`|3pLv7KBvaa	could be just stick with e rated games.  there not going to be that well as there linceses game but a three year old wont care much.<br>  <br>  it might be too much for though. go to gamestop and try the wii. judge for yourself.|`|ACG8cTpLaa	yes its good for 3 year olds i recommend u getting wii sports it would keep the childs interest|`|5fVnwm0Aaa	i would say yes, simply because it would improve their hand eye co-ordination skills, i had my 5 yr old cousin playing on mine and he loved it. I also had my 75 year old grandad on it and he loved it too,<br>  <br>  Also as he/she gets older they can play games like brain training etc to improve their...well brain!!!<br>  <br>  i would recommend the Wii, simply because it is good for all ages, i bet u'll love it too<br>  <br>  Hope that helped<br>  <br>  Mike|`|GODp5htoaa	Yup|`|oXIYHsDaaa	my son was 3 when we got our Wii, he was the best bowler in the house and the only one who can play golf worth anything. The movement control is easier for little ones then a classic controller is.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and an additional thought, even some e rated games have fairly hard controls, take a look at the back of the box the game comes in and see if it needs the nun-chuck to play the game, if so chances are the controls will be too complicated for a 3 yr old with little gaming experience. Having to move your character with the joystick on the nun-chuck while controlling the camera, actions, and selections with the remote can be hard even for older kids. A lot of third party Wii games are not designed very well. So try to find ones with simple controls to start with.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes
RpCwfcRzaa	It depends on the game. The Lego games will only save after you're done with a level.|`|wIM3vNtwaa	Whether autosave is available depends on the game|`|oJJmJTuaaa	There isn't an auto save feature on XBOX 360. Auto save is something that game developers put on their games, it's all software.
J6hMlpncaa	Roughly about 4500 web pages for 500MB but this depends on what else you will do on the phone i.e download music, watch videos games etc <br>  <br>  I have pasted the below link which takes you to a MB usage calculator provided by Vodafone, this will give you a better understanding of how much you can use.<br>  <br>  In my personal experience unless you are downloading hours of video's or hundreds of music tracks you won't get near 500MB on a handset|`|LzSj90pbaa	between 1 and 1 million pages. <br>  Every website is a different size. You could go to one page and its 500mb, you could go to another that is 1kb.
zKBueOZsaa	ya it's suite callect the tips from www.mobiledownloads4u.com|`|EjdIJhioaa	U have to just put the CD in ut PC & run it...After that it will show u all the required actions to be taken one by one itself,ok!!!!<br>  Bye<br>  Siddhartha<br>  9359909215
