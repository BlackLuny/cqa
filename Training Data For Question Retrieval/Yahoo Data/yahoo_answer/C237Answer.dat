lTkYWiy5aa	When the tests say 5 days sooner, they mean 10 days past ovulation. So theoretically you should be able to test earlier, but remember that the earlier the test, the higher the chance that you will get a false negative. The tests are only about 60% accurate 5 days sooner, but 97% accurate the day of your expected period. See the sides of the box for details. What you want to look for is how many miuls of hcg it can read (the most sensitive ones are around 20).    Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|yTcQS31Yaa	a lot of women get positive results as early as 8 days past ovulation, but when you test early you have the chance of getting a false negative.  I know it's really hard to wait, but try to wait until the first day of your missed period.  As for which test is the most sensitive and most accurate, I would go with First Response.  Good luck!!|`|L6oSDA5Yaa	i dont know for sure if that would matter but i know the First Response Test is the most sensitive and can test 5 days before your missed period
Wc3Vge9taa	You know the funny thing is that a friend of mine is in the same situation as you, and im going to tell you the same thing i tell her, get you and your baby out of there b4 the emotion abuse turns into physical abuse. You are to good for this boy, move back into your parents house and start fresh with you and your baby girl!! good luck to you and your baby girl and hope that jerk gets whats coming to him!!!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	The first time my husband said to me "you stay at home all day and relax, why are you tired" I put a stop to it right there and then.  He has not said it again.  How did I do this?  On his days off, I put him in charge of our son for the 2 full days and I took it easy watching tv, playing on the computer and going out shopping with friends.  He now never questions my ways, or reasons for doing things and is very helpful to me.  Having said that, my husband respects me, as a woman, wife and mother to his child.  Your husband doesn't seem to have that respect...for you...or any other woman by what you describe.   He is also abusive towards you, emotionally and mentally.  If I were in your shoes, I would be telling him exactly how I felt.  Communication is sometimes all that needs to happen...however counseling is a definite must when 2 people can't communicate efficiently.   If all else failed and he was still being a pompous ***, I would leave him.|`|723QHuicaa	The definition of abuse is not only physical violence. This man is mentally and emotionally abusing you.    Get out before you end up believing what he says. Your better than that.    Tell your parents, im sure they will welcome you with open arms.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	He's emotionaly abusive.    Leave him!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well I have been in a very similar situation for about 4 1/2 years my baby is 6 months old and I lived with him until I was 7 months pregnant. I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't stand him and the way he treated me so I moved out to my own place and now it is just me and my baby girl and I have never been happier. I'm glad I made that decision if I was you which I pretty much was I would leave it is so much better on your own and you feel so much better about yourself. Good luck and I'm sorry you are going through this it sucks the talking it out doesn't work.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would bust a move out of there; sounds like he has no respect for u; i  would move on....|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I have said it before and i will say it again. You need to leave him honey. He is abusing you and your daughter emotionally and that is not right at all. The man is sucking all of the emotion and love out of you. What he is doing is going to have a terrible impact on your daughter because she is so in tune with mummy's feelings. I know when i am upset then so is my daughter.   Get out of there. Get to your parents house. Make him pay child support. And make him feel like he is not worthy of you and his daughter. You deserve so so much better and you obviously are not going to get any better from him.  Good luck Hon and i hope all turns out well.    P.S: I know it is hard and i know that part of you still loves him but you need to do what is best for you andyour daughter. He is going to leave you with emotional scars and he will leave your feeling so self concious and scared to be herselfbecause of the nasty and horrible things he says. He may not be physically abusing you but take from a person who grew up in  family of physical violence, Don't wait for something really bad to happen. Get out of there while it is still safe to do so.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Move back in with your parents. He sounds like a jerk! I am sorry you have to go through that, but remember your baby will pick up on all that negativity between you two and you don't want that. You and her both deserve better and I know it's hard but I am dealing with me ex... who is a jerk too and no matter what or how hard it sometimes seems I am putting my baby first! Ugh I am really sorry!!! Just keep your head up and don't let him push you around!!! :)|`|AA12243380	*hugs hugs hugs*    It sounds like you guys are having a lot of problems right now and I can relate.  My husband and I have gone through rough patches in the past as well.    I recommend getting the book "The five love languages"  because it changed my marriage and my life.  It changed my outlook and how I look at being with my husband.    I think that you and he need to decide to choose to love one another and that means treating one another lovingly or moving on.  I think that you probably will be happier in the long run with him since you have a child together but he needs to start treating you better and you also need to read the book as well so that you can learn how to draw that good side out of him.    I know it's hard to take the first steps.  The book will give you great advice.    If I were you I'd start telling him how much you appreciate the fact that he does a job he hates for you and your baby.  Little words like that given over a period of time might start inspiring him to be a better man.    Good luck!        --Don't get me wrong, he is being a jerk but I don't think that it's past the point of no return.  It sounds like you both have "empty love tanks" and you're not feeling loved therefore you're not being loving.  If you start treating one another lovingly (and you might have to take the first steps even if he doesn't deserve it, and he's a jerk, yada yada) then the love WILL come back.  I believe in it.    He COULD change if they read this book and follow the program.  Everyone is capable of choosing whether to act lovingly or not and I think everyone wants to be loved, and cared for.|`|q51cevqLaa	Well, you know what?  You have had a baby together and still this man is basically still a jerk.  It is verbal abuse to talk to you that way.  He isn't going to change and worse than that your baby girl is going to see her mother treated badly and follow the same pattern.  I think getting out now is far easier than when your daughter knows what is going on.  She won't know the difference if you leave at this young of an age.  The bad part?  You have to be connected to this jerk forever because of your daughter.  But, finding someone to treat you better, build a life with them you can be happy in, that is what is important.  For you and your daughter.  Also, as far as you staying home and him making comments about it, that is ridiculous.  You are doing far more taking care of a baby than he could ever know about it.  Many many people who don't stay at home wonder what you do all day, I will tell you, I work a million times harder since quitting my job to stay at home!  It is nonstop!!!   If he is such a small man to not see the benefit to your family and child then he really is a schmuck!  Good luck to you and I hope whatever you decide, you find happiness!|`|UfrUnzkEaa	He is being disrespectful and insulting to you, and you do not deserve that. It's ok to be concerned if a baby is out at  10 pm. It is not ok to be insulting. Then, to say you stay home with the baby and I'll work, then say I don't like working. That is not nice. It is disrespectful. Did he think parenting and supporting someone is a cake walk? No, it is part of life. Now, you are looking for work. Why? So, he can stay home. You need to stand up for your self and take control of your life, even if that means leaving. But you deserve to be respected, and respect your self. good luck and congrats on your baby.|`|ccBNNA5paa	I'll preface this with--"Hello I'm a Man." That being said,  I know what your bf is going thru completely, but I also see your side of the story.  My wife who is from indonesia has a totally diff. idea of how we are supposed to raise our son.  He is 21 months old.  I never get to take my wife out on nice outtings either but that is because I am working about 45-50 hrs./week.  When we do, we have no babysitter cuz our kid always freaks out on them and my parents are about two and one half hours away from us.  It's hard to ahve a nice outting with the almost two yr. old tagging along.  It's more fun for him than us.        Now your bf trippin' cuz you were out at your parents house???  that's crazy!  I'd have more time to read and watch my t.v. and other things i WANT to do if my wife could go to her parents house once in awhile.  I don't wanat to get rid of her, but I wish she were gone just alittle more.  Your bf is crazy to not cherish that time and i'm sure you and mother goose and father time have a lot of fun and are all capable of taking care of your child together.    Him talking about another girl... she's probably too good for him anyways so don't worry about it except that he's a retard for even talking about another gitrl around you.  I wish they taught that lesson to boys in hi-school, it would have saved my bacon many a time!  but it is also rude of him to do that to you.  you were opbviously good enuf for him to knock you up so he shouldn't complain now or want for more.    About aaasking how your day was he shouyld do that  sometimes but it can't be a daily event.  My wife's life is boring ...she goes to the mall with her idiotic filipina friends, watches our son and t.v. and that's it maybe some laundry and grocery shopping once in a while and that's it. If I heard it once I've heard it a million times.  I know i hurts but instead you should and him too find items in the newspaper or internet to bring up and none of that celebrity gossip crap.  If he's like me he doesn't give a damn about that stuff.  Find one thing he'd find interesting and try to discuss it.    My wife's parenting skills are not that great...she has a short temper and she keeps trying the same old things and our son is past all that  she needs to mix it up a bit.  you have a 6 month old?  it's not that hard so he shouldn't complain there's not much to go wrong at that age and not much you can really do.    About his job...WAH!!  what a baby! I've had the same job for 5 yrs. and am finally starting to go palces and my wife wants me to quit and move so we can be close to my parents who are almost 70 cuz they can babysit for us Hah!  I don't want that i'm doing the best I ever did and she wants me to bail on that!??  You and IA we got problems sister, but it's hard to just "talk them out" isn't it when you've been talking to the same dumb A** for as long as we have?  you should leave him he sounds like a jerk.  I'm getting very close to leaving my wife but I got to work out the logistics first cuz she's from indo nesia and i don't want to lose my kid  take care and good luck!|`|I1wwpx69aa	I have a similar situation; i can relate like how he wants to marry when the "time is right", doesn't like spending much time with us, makes demeaning "jokes"....; but in a way i've come to see where he's coming from.  I know that he works very hard to support us & after a long day @ work idk if I would want to do much either (he tries but he is very tired); plus the marriage thing; I understand that we have fights & it seems like we don't get a long ever & that's the reason why he doesn't want to get married (he kinda felt like why get married in those circumstances)..but a marriage will have it's ups & downs; it will never only be perfection; you can't wait for that time cause it will never come;  so that's not really an excuse; it doesn't make sense to do everything else you do in a marriage but not be worthy of a marriage.  The demeaning comments he calls "jokes" ...he's got an outgoing (humorous) personality so I kinda understand that he's trying to be funny; but he needs to learn when to draw the line.  He has realized that they hurt me & tries to control them...    It has gotten a lot better after communicating, we have been attending church & getting to know God (which has helped a lot), we have talked & shared our opinions & feelings, have been working together to make it better & more importantly gain our respect, love, & trust towards each other back; we're still working on it; but I can tell there's been a change on him.  He is learning to respect me & to take my feelings into consideration & I am also learning to appreciate him & work with him; and compromise.      I think you should talk to him tell him exactly how you feel in a nice way, (not in a mad or judging way - I use to do that).  You can try giving him a compliment & telling him nice things like how you appreciate him & then tell him what bothers you (you know mix it up so he can see the good & the bad).  Maybe this way it will be easier for him to hear you out.    I wish you the best & hope it gets better; God Bless You!    p.s: i'm here if you ever wanna talk|`|LwJ7EiZ4aa	I am so sorry that you have to go through this. He sounds very emotionally and verbally abusive.  I am the same age (well 24)  and my daughter just turned 7 months old yesterday. And if it were me I would do what is best for both myself and my daughter and I would leave. Not only is it unhealthy for me but it is unhealthy for my daughter and I wouldn't want her to htink that that is hot a relationship should be.     No one can tell you what you need to do. The best advice is to do what is best for you and your little girl. You are her mom and you know what is best for her and it is your job to make sure that it happens.     Good luck! :)|`|NVmDVBPyaa	OH honey, you need to get away from this guy.  If you married him, it would get worse.  Say goodbye and don't look back.  You want someone who adores you and treats you like a princess, anything else is a waste to spend your heart on.  He's just going to get worse.  If  your parents are willing, go back with them until you can get your feet on the ground and make a new start.  Do you want your baby girl growing up hearing her Daddy make fun and be mean to her momma?  She'll think all men are like that and stats show will marry someone similar.   When oicking your spouse, think of your children.  Move on, sweetie!!|`|Jr9j5f6naa	What happens when your baby gets older? he'll probably tell her things like that, and he childhood will be out the window. He's got problems, and he's not good enough for anybody. Please get out of there!|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Hey hunnie,    I have answered a few of your questions and even emailed you regarding them. Sweetie, I think you know the answer to these questions and just need a little reassurance and support. Your parents seem like they will open their home to you and I am sure being with your parents will be a much healthier environment for you and your daughter. If you stay with this man you will continue to be miserable and you will start losing your self...forgetting who you truely are. Maybe you have already started feeling this way? Please email me if you want to chat. Good luck as always xoxoxo|`|LdSeFvIjaa	hey gal calm down and think about yoself now about what do you want in yo life. I have neva bn in a situation but I can only advice you to leave him nobody wants to stay in an abusive relationship, he is wasting yo time you are too good to be with him and he doesn't deserve you. What you need to do calm down and tell him that you sick and tired of all his sh**t so now he must back off its yo time to shine you going back to your parents house and xplain to yo father that you did yo best but the guy is a jerk. I know its gonna be hard to leave some1 you love but he doesn't love you back as you do why should you.    There worst thing this is going to affect your baby and you so it wl b hard to get a job when you disturbed. Leave him honey he is totally useless and you r way too beautiful to b compared with others we all made different to each other stand up and leave the jerk..
UMjOnIdHaa	I was born with the same thing. You had water in your brain. Your laughing and your smiles have nothing to do with the fluid that was overflowing in the brain. I am also but I know for a fact that the water that was in my brain did not cause it. The name of this condition is hydrocephalus.  Take care|`|n6XYYyoLaa	do u have shunts? if so, u should be fine..|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Could be, could not be.  The symptoms of hydrocephalus in adults are:    Headache; difficulty in remaining awake or waking up; loss of coordination or balance; bladder control problems; impaired vision and cognitive skills that may affect job performance and personal skills.    It is possible that your nervous tic and laugh are part of mild, mild cognitive skills issues, but I think it's more likely that it's because you're nervous and shy.  A disease that affects the nervous system does not cause "nervousness" by the way.  The words are connected, but they mean totally different things in those contexts.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I really have no idea sorry I would ask a doc
IDS64Eh8aa	We started with baby-led-weaning at 6 months, her first food was steamed broccoli and carrots. Then it was avocado, sweet potatoes, apples, melon, will be trying cheese and meat soon. After 3 weeks of playing with food she's doing great, eats quite a bit, loves broccoli and rice cakes!|`|Ezkn5azdaa	With my first son he was formula feed do him being born with cleft palate. He start cereal at 4 months. He couldn't handle the spoon. So he was getting cereal and baby food in his bottle. He had weight issue that he was gaining any weight. With my second son he was breastfeed and formula feed has well. And when was 4 months old he started cereal and baby food has well. Start stage 1 and then moved to stage 2 later on and then stage 3. And when he was 1 year old he started table food. Some doctors are waiting till they are 6 months old to start them on solids and cereal. I have a baby girl she is 8 weeks old. She been having weight issue has well. I might start her on baby food or just cereal at 4 months old just to get her gaining weight.|`|723QHuicaa	Breast fed at birth, experienced problems, then formula fed.    Solids at 4m on advice of dr.    Started  with a few spoonfuls a day, once a day. started with mashed potato, mashed banana, carrot, sweet potato, baby porridge.    She wasnt ready for stage 2 at recommended 7m, closer to 8.5m. by 10m she was on table food eating what we eat.    Tried to introduce cows milk at 12m - she wouldnt entertain it. She was on toddler formula till 15m, then she eventually took cows milk.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	once we got the ok from the doc; we started cereal; she figured it out pretty quick so i moved on the stage one fruits and veggies (she likes them all) and stage two single foods bc they were the same thing , j ust a much bigger jar for two  cents more (at walmart--we use beechnut, nothing in it except the food and  water for puree); then as she say had already had apples with no problem, now sometimes i giive her one that has apples and someting else mixed with it like blueberry....she started with fruits,  no prob going to veggies, i just rotated them; now i feed her veggies, and then some fruit afterward; she's seven mos...funny thing is, she didn't do well with them runny as they come, so i always have to thicken everything with cereal....she also loves the beechnut oatmeal by itself....until she gets better at gumming it instead of just swallowing it, we won't go to stage 3 that has chunks......as soon as she is good at gumming, we will give her some appropriate table food as well....hth; btw, i use rice cereal to thicken her food, but she does not like it by itself....hth--we are also having schedule changes with her right now, she is changing her napping pattern so it is hard to slip in  a second feeding, but the doc said we could at this point....|`|vewYW4wcaa	i started with some rice cereal in the bottle around 5 months, then runny cereal at about 6. After that for a month i would start with a spoonful of fruit or veggie mixed into the cereal. Worked out really well for us.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I breastfed my baby until she was two in a half months old. That is all she would go till. She was 3 1/2 months old when she had rice cereal, doc said it was fine. She started first foods at 4 months old and second foods at 6 months old not quite 6 months but a few days till. she still has a bottle she is perfectly healthy. That is all the info I have because she is only 6 months.
6GIp6pM3aa	PEDICURE...your pregnant you deserve it! And why not go out and have a little fun, just because your pregnant dosent mean you have to sit at home!   Go somewhere casual and where jeans and a cute top and flip flops. If he looks at you funny make a joke about how NONE of your clothes or shoes fit!  OR, go shopping!!!!|`|claW4UUcaa	i remember crying b/c i couldn't paint my own toes :(    go get a pedi or see if your friend will paint them for you. a simple black tee and some cute pants would be fine. have a casual date at your friends house. that way there is no pressure to dress up.|`|BkVMXkgSaa	pedicure, that will make you looking nice...|`|DNygQdmVaa	get a pedi :]    and yes go for it. pregnant girls need attention too!    wear a sexy materntiy dress :]
LPsogWKSaa	You are right hun she would wake you up if she was hungry. Theres no need to wake her up, just enjoy the extra few hours sleep you are getting! My baby was on the same routine (also ff) and the 1st thing you start to notice is that they will go longer during the night between feeds.|`|deIzFnV8aa	You definitely don't need to wake her up by this age. She should be starting to sleep longer during the night around now anyway, and she is old enough that if she is hungry she will definitely wake you up and let you know!  At this age I think our daughter was eating at about 10 pm and then 5-6, and she was clearly thriving despite eating less at night.  If you worry she isn't getting enough food, (not that it sounds like you need to!), you can try "cluster feeding" at night, where you feed her every 2 hours for the last 2-3 feeds.  That way you know she has her calories to make it through sleeping :)  But it sounds to me like you both are doing great as is.|`|LiiAhWYEaa	no...your baby will be fine! If you wake them up when they are sleeping they will get used to eating in the middle of the night. You want them to get used to sleeping at night and eating during the day. Just leave your baby...let them sleep. You are not starving your child. My son was sleeping through the night at 6 weeks old because I never woke him and that was how he got used to it.|`|EqGSu0W1aa	No If you wake her up, then she will never learn how to sleep throguh the night. She will wake up if she is hungry.|`|X6as2nOAaa	No let her sleep she will wake up when she is hungry only if the doc told you to usually like when they are preemies and things like that they have to be feed but as long as she is healthy let her sleep until she wants to eat.|`|fZgoUty4aa	baby's dont wake up when hungry some do but you have to do it...apart form that shes fine|`|UfrUnzkEaa	No. She is fine. If you are uncertain, ask your doctor. They can assess her weight/height issues. Mine slept thru at 8 to 10 weeks and were nursed.
DN6XtoViaa	you can experience almost any of the pregnancy symptoms after implantation happens (6-10dpo)    but truth is there really is no knowing by just symptoms alone.   i had the exact same symptoms as you this month and still ended up getting AF 4 days late.   don't want to let you down, but if your hopes are super high then if it doesn't happen you feel major down in the dumps!    good luck and hope its your month!|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	wait till you expecting your period then, test|`|rmse6Mj8aa	dont look for signs. i have had 'signs' like you wouldnt believe and always not pregnant    the one time i was pregnant i only took a test cos i felt like it, and it was a chemical pregnancy. no real signs - no more than usual pms that time.    the only way to know if you are truly preg is to keep testing once your period is late and use a sensitive test.    most people say they just 'know' they are pregnant.  can you say that you really think you are?  wait and see. sorry there is no answer. that's why its called the 2 week wait. it's horrible.    good luck and baby dust to you|`|yTcQS31Yaa	Period symptoms and pregnancy symptoms are very similar so it's hard to tell them apart.  Have you taken a test yet?  If not, I would take a test to know for sure.  All the symptoms you explained are very  pregnancy symptoms.  Are these the kinds ofsymptoms you normally feel when you're about to start your period too???  I recommend checking out twoweekwait.com.  Good luck!
F6jUJUoOaa	sounds pretty normal, if ur not bleeding down below and ur waters arent broken then i think its nothing to worry about, but try poppin to ur GP on monday to get it checked out and u can talk to ur midwife on utesday, could be a water infection as its very common in pregnant ladies. but get it checked anyway  takecare hun x|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i had the same at week 19 and it was a urine infection|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It could mean nothing, it could mean the baby is kicking your cervix - if your cervix is dilating you may be put on pelvic rest, and perhaps have a cerclage put in place.   Good luck, I hope it's nothing.
HXfHkoSHaa	When I was pregnant and my clothes wouldn't fit anymore, I sure didn't attribute it to bloating.  I was big as a house and it was the baby bump.  I carried a lot of water weight, but that was in my hands and feet, not belly.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	maybe it depends on what size the baby is at each stage of pregnancy|`|8OoqHpbIaa	if its hard its the baby and placenta if it soft its water therefore counted as bloating ( this kind of bloating doesnt show on 1st or 2nd pregancy  as the muscles hold it in)|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	this is my 3rd and i also showed insanely early :)|`|io0QtYYtaa	o it all depends on your body type. if you are petite and skinny then i am sure you are showing it all depends on you and how it looks. congrats on the baby!!|`|Bg6txvxqaa	This is my first pregnancy and it's twins but I regarded myself as truly showing at the beginning of last week so just at the end of the 17 weeks. Before that i just looked like id put on a bit of holiday weight lol    As it's twins, at 15 weeks my uterus measured just above my naval so I'm actually suprised I didn't start showing earlier!|`|p2l8zQYuaa	I am 8 weeks pregnant, 5th child and I am showing early.
A1S5KNUkaa	Yup I was exactly the same as you!  Had to get my partner to check it AND my niece....then my mother.....  I then did another test hours later (which was pointless really) and the same thing happend...very faint line.  So the next day I took a digital test which would remove all doubt and it did.  I was definitely pregnant and am now 18 weeks =)    Take another test on Monday morning and fingers crossed the line should be darker.    Good luck x|`|4yGGjs7zaa	faint line or strong line either one means you are pregnant! the line wont appear at all if you are not pregnant! this means that the test pick up an amount of pregnancy hormone to produce the second line! even if it appeared before 3 mins doesnt mean its not a positove!|`|YgDKvY7Raa	Its possible post a picture to get more definate answers. Good luck hope its your month!|`|b3906bcb6d9a27e96e465d1a0b21ccf6aa	I waited for 4 days after my period and the pregnancy line appeared first and was way darker. I know this doesn't help, but try waiting til your period is missed before taking a test. It is easier to do that then stress your body out and mess up your period.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	Faint line=Positive. Congratulations! You caught it early, call your Dr. on Monday and schedule a blood test. Dont bother with another pee test today as your hcg levels are probably only concentrated enough in your morning urine for now. You can try again in 3 days and it should be a little darker. Your HcG should at least double every 2-3 days.
6GIp6pM3aa	YES...I feel like mines going to start anytime and I am between about 6 weeks. I asked my Dr. about that and she said it was normal as long as you dont have bleeding and heavy cramping!|`|b3906bcb6d9a27e96e465d1a0b21ccf6aa	I am 18 weeks almost 19. I still have "cramps" around the time my period would be here. I don't know what that means exactly but I still feel like I could have a period if there wasn't a little one in there. Some girls have their periods, light bleeding, and even spotting. I suppose these cramps are natural because my doctor said not to worry. Wait til you get heartburn (I pray you don't).|`|WeW3Gj3Baa	You are going into labor.|`|3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	You know I have that same fluid. It is clear, kind of watery/lotion like.  I know exactly what you mean.  I am still waiting to test again so I am not sure if I am pregnant or not yet. However since my symptoms seem to be masking yours I have to think I have a good chance.  But it is completely normal to have this in pregnancy.  It is your body's way of flushing out the vagina and keeping safe and clean. Don't worry, because it is also a sign that your mucus plug is forming correctly. Just take a deep breathe and enjoy being pregnant.  If there is a lot of it wear a panty liner for awhile.:).|`|hKlsJgVSaa	It is normal, I can;t remember how it all works but's you still go thru the cycle but you don't have the part that turns it red (I can't remember if it's the eggs or what but yeah)    I had that almost all they way thru my pregancy.
Fx77zYhWaa	It won't harm the baby but if you're having a really bad cough for more than a few days they usually tell you to go to the doctor to make sure it's not more than the common cold.|`|YgDKvY7Raa	You can take robitussin any one just not the night time one though it will help soo much I had to take it when I was pregnant I was really sick, my dr and the hospital told me it was fine. The hospital said that's what we give pregnant women. Hope this helps! Good luck and congrats!|`|i8Ch743Laa	Have you taken any meds for it? I've got a list right here of OTC meds my dr told me was safe,so I am going to post it to try and help you out. It does hurt,I agree lol. Good luck,feel better :D It's listed here if you're not supposed to take it before the second trimester.

Bw1h5xAcaa	How about setting some ground rules with him ahead of time, and let him know that if you start feeling uncomfortable by his presence for any reason you will ask him to leave. That way you're at least giving him the opportunity to be there - if he can behave himself.    He has no "right" to be there, even if he was your husband. You can ask the nurse to help you enforce your wishes, and if he becomes beligerent security can come and have him removed by force.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	Do what is best for you at that time.  He can see his baby soon after but the less stress you feel during labour the better.  How you feel will  also affect your little bundle on the way.|`|AA11024148	he's not your husband. he's the one who knocked you up and left you.  sorry to be so straight forward with you, but it sounds like you need it.    how about having your mom or dad there with you?    alone sounds best unless you really want to choke him or do some serious damage to him. this would be the time to do it and not get into any trouble..... you could pick him up by his throat and no one will care. you can punch him in the face and he will be the one laughed at. it depends on how YOU want to deal with the situation.|`|CdGOuEmpaa	u should let people who rly care about u, and u rly care about them! so maybe ur mother, sister, aunt, close, friend, etc. if u have any doubts abt some1, maybe u shouldn't let them in. its going to be tough, and stressful enough, w/out some1 nagging u all the time! so just go with ur mother, closest friend, or someone u just really care about!!!|`|jChr0udLaa	Only have who will make you comfortable and relaxed during labor. You can also tell the nurses who is and is not welcome it the room with you. Good luck!|`|E7LSetRHaa	You need to be relaxed and comfortable. I am sorry your going through this but if he makes you uncomfortable then you should have your friend. Also write a birthing plan so the nurses at the hospital know what you want. Good luck and God bless.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Here's a secret of the labor and delivery floor. Most of the nurses and doctors have been in labor before - they understand. If you wanted someone out of your room, they will get them out of your room. Ha-ha, if they had a nickel for every time they heard a woman in labor yell,  "You ever come near me wanting sex again, I'll snip you myself!" to her partner they would not need to work in the first place.    You want someone you are comfortable with. Remember that you are, of course, having a baby, but it is you and you alone who has to feel the pain of labor. If you don't want the father there, don't have him there.    One more thing, it is your body, and you get to chose whatever pain medication you do or don't want. If he's got a problem with that, he can push that baby out himself!|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i think you should have somebody you trust in with you. having him can be an option but i would speak to him first. and tell him that any decision made in the delivery room is going to be made by you. i don't think it would be fair to leave him out of it just like that. you guys should probably have a very good conversation about it first. but it's not right for him to decide whether or not you use any pain medication, but if you want to have him with you there you should probably have him come with you to your final appointments, that way he can ask anything he wants to ask to the doctor and so the doctor can explain to him what are the things that you really need while in labor.  i don't know how your relationship with your mother is. but instead of having a friend with me i would rather have my mom. but  that's just me. you should pick whoever you feel comfortable with.  so instead of rushing into a decision, you should still think about it and speak to your doctor. who knows having your baby's dad in there with you might be a good idea. maybe he'll realize how special becoming a mom really is, and that will make you guys have a better relationship.  since most men that i have spoke to, said that once they saw their wives giving birth the images of them changed completely, they saw them as strong but very sensible persons. since they actually know what they went through to give birth.  good luck i hope you have a very healthy baby.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	you are the patient.  You control who is in the room.  if you don't want the dad in the room, then he cannot come in the room.  All you do is tell the staff at the hospital and they have to follow your wishes.  The dad may choose to wait in the waiting room, as is his right.  do what makes you  feel best.....labor is long and it's not fun. you most definitely want to cut down on stress on that big day.  good luck!|`|6GIp6pM3aa	Whoever makes you comfortable and at ease should be in the room with you!|`|AA11348933	The only person that "has" to be there is the mother (for obvious reasons). Tell the nurses that you don't want him in there and they will keep him out.  If he would stress you out then I don't think it would be a good idea.  Have a friend there who will be supportive of you.|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	do what is best for you and the baby some people prefer to be completely alone for the labor while others want everyone there and how dare he say u cant take pain meds he not the one who has to go through labor|`|tO7lBnMfaa	You two aren't married and HE broke up with you. I would choose to have my mom or a really close friend or family member in there. You need to do what is best for you and the baby which means no stress and pain meds if you need them.|`|HCHqFLF0aa	grl jus dnt tell him wen u go into labor..and call him after|`|io0QtYYtaa	do what is best for you. if you think that he will stress you out then please don't have him in there. when you are stressed so is your baby and you don't want to strain the babies heart. good luck!!|`|claW4UUcaa	if you don't want him in there don't do it. he will stress you out. my grandma stressed me out. i kicked her out lol. as for pain medication take them if you need them who cares what he thinks. let him pass a few kidney stones (the closest thing to labor a man can go through) and see if he needs pain killers. tell your doctor about him. if you decide to let him in there you can always kick him out.|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	You don't need any more stress in the delivery room. Let whoever is the most supportive come with you.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	If he's going to make you uncomfortable don't allow him in there especially if you have different opinions about pain medication.  A good friends that is supportive will be much more helpful.  Maybe have him come in once you're pushing and the baby's crowning so you won't get into an argument over the pain medication because it's already been done/or you decided against it on your own.  He can still be there when the baby is born but you avoid arguments.|`|170b7e2476f78e0c5b6737427b428500aa	You need to think about what will be the most healthy and helpful during your birth. Anyone that is going to stress you out and take away from your experience should not be allowed to be in the room. As an option, try offering instead that you will videotape the birth and if anyone wants that you could make copies especially for the father. That way you can focus on the birth and not worry what people are saying or doing. Another hint...if you want pain meds take them. Good Luck!|`|44OH7Si6aa	He may feel he has the right to be there for the birth, but until the baby is out it's under your control. Tell him you want the friend in there because it is best for the baby that you remain as stress free as possible. You can talk to the nurses in the maternity ward of the hospital and ask if you could have two people in the room. Maybe having him and the friend won't be as bad and if he starts stressing you out you can tell him to leave the room. The nurses will make sure he does so.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	You can have any one you want in there with you. And NO, he doesn't have to be in there, especially if you react to him in stressful ways. The nurses will boot him out if you get all freaked out over him saying things or doing things that aren't good for you. Childbirth is hard enough when you have a supportive person with you. I wouldn't let him be there and make trouble for me.|`|NysFTExhaa	Have someone in there that will make you comfortable.  Stress in labor can actually make it longer and more painful for you and the baby so it's not a good time to get into an argument over an epidural.  Have him wait outside the delivery room so that he's there for the weighing, and to hold your baby, maybe have him be involved by calling people while you're in labor or have him do some sort of errand.  You said he can be controlling, don't let him try to twist your arm into agreeing to something you don't feel comfortable with.  If you don't want him in there, stick with that.|`|bvX8ycVzaa	Wow just tell him he can be at the hospital but he can't be in the room with you. Have someone who will support you and who cares about what you want be in the room with you. Also about the pain medication it should be your choice, I did it for both of mine without any meds but it hurts and it's your body and your choice.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No- he does not have to be there just because it's his baby.  You have whoever you want there, and personally if it were me I wouldn't want this man there.  You take all the meds they will give you- you are the one in pain, not him.  What right does he have to tell you not to take any pain meds?  I wouldn't let him be there until after the baby is born.  It's your body, not his.

HXfHkoSHaa	Please don't switch formulas without instruction from the doctor.  especially at such a young age.  Most formulas will cause constipation.  Because he was a preemie, I'd call his pediatrician for advice on what to do.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	talk to doc first; changing formulas can be very hard on a lil one's tummy; he may rather u do something for the constipation than change formulas...|`|X6as2nOAaa	There are a few things that can make a  baby constipated sometimes they need the formula changed and other times they just need a suppository. You need to call the doc and talk with them and they will tell you what to do that is the best thing that is what they are there for.|`|fHjSonssaa	I have a son who was born 7 weeks early.  He is not 10 months old.  He was in Enfamil Enfacare- which made him EXTREMELY constipated.  We still kept him on this formula because they need it due to their prematurity.  My DR suggestion prune juice initially- and that helped at first- but then it stopped working- so we tried pear juice and that really helped.  She also told us that he he hasn't gone for awhile (and you should also be able to feel his stomach and know he's backed-up, it will be harder)- it's OK to give him a glycerin suppository if needed,  Just cut it down so it's not as large.  They don't absorb that actual glycerin.  That helped my son as well.    As he started gaining weight and catching up, she told us it was OK to play around with formulas- and Nutramigen is the only one that made him not constipated as he got older- and it's what he's on now.  He also continued to give him Enfacare for awhile- we would mix (he had to get used to the taste, as they are VERY different tasting formulas).  As always, talk to your DR before changing anything for your son- especially at thsi young age.    Good luck!!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Changing formula sometimes exacerbates constipation as their digestive systems take time to get adjusted to new food.  Give him pear juice - or a glycerine suppository if he hasn't done a smelly for 3 or 4 days.  (Get baby-size suppositories - you don't have to cut them up).
ZiaPbKwaaa	It does happen, but it is rare !! He could always have it reversed, if he decide's now that he wants kids.|`|FVFxE6owaa	Yes, it's possible.  My sister and I are proof of that!  My dad had a vasectomy 14 years before I was born so I was certainly a shock to my parents.    My sister is seven years younger than me and was conceived while my mom was on birth control.    Everyone in my family (grandparents, aunts, cousins) seem to get pregnant so easily (usually accidental) while my husband and I will probably have to try for awhile for it to happen (February will be our fourth month of TTC).|`|yTcQS31Yaa	yes...he can still have children once he gets a reversal.|`|AXEqOEloaa	My cousins husband had his reversed after 8 years and they were able to conceive.    But if you are asking can you have children with a vasectomy that is highly unlikely.|`|AA12138071	probably not, but not impossible. If someone he's involved with is pregnant, I'd recommend a paternity test.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	it is possible but the changes are very low!   you can have a reversal however it is 100% reversed and it can cost alot of money as this cannot be done on the nhs (if your in the uk) dont know about anywhere else in the world! best thing you can do is talk to a doctor who maybe able to help witht he options
fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	You may be feeding the baby too much, try cutting back and burp the child about half way through the feeding. Good luck to you.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	go to the doc, NOW|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Speak to your doctor.  This is not always an easy problem to solve.  Does your baby seem distressed when she does it?  Is she gagging, like she's vomiting?  Or does formula just seem to "back up" after she has a bottle.    Are you burping her?  Sometimes that helps, sometimes that just makes them spit up when you burp them.  Are you ensuring that she's not getting a lot of air when you feed her?  You can try feeding her less, more frequently, if that's not going to make her miserable.    Talk to your doctor about the possibility of acid reflux.  Honestly, even if it is acid reflux, there may not be much you can do about it other than wait until she outgrows it.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	Is he throwing up or spitting up?|`|X6as2nOAaa	Sounds like she is over eating but call your doc and talk to them.|`|JurCyY2Gaa	don't feed it bottles. babies who are not breast feed often develop food allergies.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	call pediatrician|`|R2OMEjrhaa	try switching the formula we had to switch my daughter to soy.|`|UlrvomV5aa	check to make sure that the plastic isn't making it sick or your baby isn't allergic to the stuff inside.|`|fMxVDps3aa	Can you give more detail plz? My first born needed her formula switched when she was only a couple days old. If that helps.|`|Kbs0HNomaa	Have an allergy check on the baby because when I was young I wouldn't stop throwing up after i drank milk in a bottle.

You might want to try a soy or other lactose-free formula.  That worked with my oldest son.|`|AX13vUJeaa	It's called calling your docter.  Maybe your feeding your baby too much.  But still.  Call the docter|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Sounds like he has acid reflux.  The formula may be just fine.  Don't switch him just yet.  Try feeding him half as much, twice as often.  And prop him up to sleep.  Get a Dr's appointment.  He should pin point this much better for you.  He will advise you on whether to change his formula or give him meds.|`|0hRTaqJCaa	call the doctor|`|4KMSKrxQaa	change the bottle lol|`|AgIjuGaxaa	See a doctor.  He/she may have allergies.

But if its just spitting up, try a different formula.|`|JEbGZigOaa	Make sure you aren't overfeeding the baby. If that doesn't work you need to see the baby's doctor.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Get off the computer and call your pediatrician immediately! A baby can dehydrate very quickly. You don't say how long this has been going on or how old the baby is. Could be an allergy to the formula, a stomach virus, anything. Send someone to the store to get some Pedialyte and try that until you can get to the doctor, but don't fool around. If you can't get to a doctor, I'd go to your nearest clinic or emergency room, pronto!|`|m16dhfrGaa	The usual thing to do is feed about one ounce, then pat the baby's back until they hiccup, then feed a little more, then wind again.  If a lot of air accumulates in their little stomach it forces the milk up.  You may already be doing this, but if not then try it and cut down the amount given in each feed.  Try a little and often approach and wind that baby often.|`|AA11625299	are they throwing up? or spitting up a little? talk to your babys doctor, my daughter was doing that, and I switched her to sensitive and she barely spits up now, only if she over eats|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	I would go to the doctors it could be a lot of things.

b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	I have 4 kids, none followed the "normal" birth and all were different.    I have to agree with Melanie in part.  The pre-natal classes help reassure you and go through different possibilities  You tube would need some sound editting, otherwise the mother's painful cries seem more important than the joy afterwards    While my first was born in our maternity hospital, we heard noises coming from other rooms. "Ah, Ah, AH, THUD".   Our midwife just shrugged and said, "Sounds like another husband fainted."|`|X6as2nOAaa	Sorry to say but nothing will ever prepare you for what you are going to go thorugh but it is wonderful. I would say google videos for that.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	Just go to youtube thats what i did. The best video I ever saw was the one shown at the birthing class though. Also, videos can never really prepare you for child birth. Not much can. You just need to expect the unexpected, because your experience will likely be nothing like any video you will watch. Also, videos make it look more bloody than it really is. There is not that much blood!|`|DrFJfnpBaa	there is a website that has categories of water births, home births, unassisted births, and hospital births.  its birth videos.googlepages.com.   no www though.  It is perfect, plus if you haven't decided on what type of way to give birth, watching these videos is great for help to decide.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	sorry but nothing can actually prepare you for childbirth but what i can tell you is that there are a lot of horror stories out there and it is very rare for disasters to happen. also people deal with pain in different ways and have different pain thresholds some women will scream blue murder whilst others stay calm and relaxed.   the main advice i can give you is to try and stay calm as stress will make your body fight the pain and it makes things much more painful as a result, try and stay relaxed and above all don't lose sight of the end product - your beautiful little baby    go with the flow and remember that every contraction is one step closer to the end.   congratulations and i'm sure it is not an experience you will ever forget childbirth is very painful for most women but an experience that few would ever take back and wish had never happened as it is an overwhelming experience that we are lucky enough to take part in.
M92DlyzDaa	Ehm,,what about you make it yourself? 1/2 liter of milk with 2 REALLY heaped table spoons of corn flour and you have a lovely pudding :) You can add as much sugar as you want or just nothing :P My babies didn't mind things without sugar at that age :) But every baby is ofcourse different.    You make it like this. First disolve the corn flour in some water to avoid lumps. Then pour it in the milk and then keep stirring while heating it. Then it's done :)  You can also add vanilla or custard powder instead of corn flour,because I did read you were asking about custard not about pudding.|`|FcHplZtQaa	I give my twins Heinz baby custard with fruit, but thats only because it's been on special offer for ages.....

fcfd19147db60f65269e3a714d3a6e21aa	1. See if your city has any additional housing programs besides section 8. All housing programs are income based. I live in NY, and they have section 8, as well as other programs. You can probably locate the information thru community based services in your area.   2. You could reapply for welfare for your son alone. Even though you had it before and they closed your case. If you are receiving wic for him, they they could open a budget for him alone, without you on it. It probably won't be a lot, but it would help.  3. Daycare- See if your job, has a program to assist you with daycare. Some-places do.   4. This would be a temp solution: If you got your w2, file your taxes. This would help in a big way. This can at least help you start getting everything in order.   Remember, this is only temporary. You will and can find a way out of this situation. You just can't give up.|`|VkRyId0Naa	Find another job|`|faueyTBvaa	I don't know if this would help.. but we have a few churches here that give items to families who need them like food and diapers. You may check there to see if any places there have anything such as that. It isn't much food but it helps if you don't have much.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I ran into this sort of jam when I was in university (i.e. less money than was needed to live on). Looking for a new job or second job is a great long term solution, but you obviously need something more short term. I would suggest babysitting or seeing if some of your neighbors would need you for odd jobs when you are off of work, since the money for those sorts of things is immediate and all under the table. I know that this sounds lame, but paper delivery routes are something that you and your son could do together, and they would pay just a little bit extra if you need it. You can also try to speak to your employer. I'm not sure what your state laws and company policies are on vacation and banking vacation pay, but some employers would be willing to pay out your banked vacation pay or give you an advance on your pay to help you. I used to be a payroll and benefits administrator, and I had a lot of people approach me with similar issues. We had the option in some cases to scale back their benefits premiums and to have their income tax deductions reduced. If nothing else works, I hate to say it, but you might want to look at a line of credit until you have a better job or second source of income in place.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would look for a better job and I would definitly seek child support and I would also go to like the workforce department where you live so they can help get you on food stamps and that kind of thing and maybe get you some diversion money.|`|AA10305048	If I were you, I would make sure the baby's father is helping me. You didn't mention him. Even if you are not with him, he still has responsibilities to the baby. Get child support.|`|UNLrYNeUaa	maybe I could move in with you|`|IllWKAUGaa	You need to get on foodstamps and welfare, or some sort of government assistance....wic should be able to point you in the right direction, and maybe even help you out with more vouchers or something...You should start buying generic, it's all the same, you're just paying more for the name of the brand name stuff....shop at the cheaper supermarkets, and cut out coupons and stuff....get cheaper car insurance, do you really need full coverage? i think diapers are more important....you could invest in some cloth diapers, then you don't need to worry about buying any....it's much cheaper to use cloth ones. you can buy any baby clothes at second hand stores....you should goto the department of public housing and see if you can get even cheaper living costs somewhere else...where is the baby's father? you should get some child support from him if he isn't giving you it already, take his *** to court for it if he won't co-operate.  you just need to be smart about your money and spread it out....make sure you shut the lights out when you leave the room, don't leave any unecessary electronics on, even if they're plugged in they are still using electricity...many people get by on very little, im sure you will make it through....    good luck!
nluNSDI4aa	Ok the person who first gave you answer looks like a complete dumb ***(please excuse my french) Though you have had unprotected sex and could be pregnant, factors still very. For 1 it all depends on when in your cycle did you have unprotected sex. If you have had it around the time for you to ovulate or the day of ovulation, than your chances of pregnancy are pretty high. If you had sex like 2 days after your period than its possibly low though some women do ovulate right after there period. If you are not trying to get pregnant then you really should strap up or go on a pill(your choice) if you are trying to conceive then i wish you the best of luck! Seeing that you are curious...buy a home pregnancy test and take it the day before your period(if your anxious) or the day after your missed period. PLEASE DO REMEMBER THAT A MISSED PERIOD CAN BE A RESULT OF STRESS OR JUST BODY CHANGES...though in your case...TEST lol. And make sure you test in the morning. ALSO! PREGNANCY TEST CAN HAVE A RESULT OF "NEGATIVE" IF YOU HAVE DONE IT WRONGLY OR JUST NOT ENOUGH HGC LEVES IN YOUR URINE(TOO SOON TO TEST), if it says negative, retest in 3 days.|`|N6XTcGejaa	you have all the possibilities of being pregnant. wait till you miss a period and test. see if you are showing pregnancy symptoms at http://www.easyninemonths.com/pregnancy_...|`|zVJMMhcOaa	i would be careful  but you should always us protection because of the fact you can get pregnant and a std but you should just get your self checked out|`|X6as2nOAaa	Yes you could be.|`|7nGwou8uaa	of course you could be pregnant...no protection...|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes you sould be pregnant, smart one.|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's DEFINATELY possible,and not every woman has implantation bleeding. I didn't with my first pregnancy,but I did with this one. You seemed to have sex at the time where you were most fertile as well,but I'm not exactly sure,as the body works in mysterious ways. If you are late,take a test.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	You have to wait about another 3 weeks or so until you know. It's possible|`|tbeO3Lataa	Your answer is in your question.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	HE NUTTED IN ME ?

Good Luck!|`|DrFJfnpBaa	It is very possible that you could be. If you start having morning sickness then you should immediately take a pregnancy test. Other than that, wait a few weeks then take the test.|`|AA11024148	pregnancy should probably the LEAST of your worries.   you aren't even educated enough to know what implantation bleeding is; you've heard of it....    some people shouldn't breed|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Every time I have had unprotected sex, I got pregnant. But that was the plan.  I haven't had implantation bleeding with this one, yet. We just found out 2 days ago. With my 1st, no implantation bleeding. With my 2nd, implantation bleeding. It doesn't happen to every one.    Stop having unprotected sex if you don't want to be pregnant.
ISNdzRCHaa	Most companies just give 6 weeks for maternity leave. It depends on what you do for a living, and if some of the work could be done from home. My sister did finance, and retained her normal salary while working about 30 hrs from home. She also had about 12 weeks of maternity leave where she had no work to do from home.    Typically, because most companies offer only 6 weeks paid, many women wait until right before their due date, or even until they go into labor! They want to have the maximum amount of time at home with their child. But, if your company is flexible, and you have additional vacation time, or can afford no pay for a few weeks, I suppose it would make sense to have a few weeks before hand to prepare everything for baby's arrival.    Four of my friends just had babies, and they all worked until they were either having contractions, or until they were induced. It's really a personal choice.|`|p2l8zQYuaa	I am going to work until my due date and then go on maternity leave.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	I planned on working until my I went into labor, but i stopped a week early because I was enduced, which it didn't work.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I've given a provisional leaving date of 19th June and I'm due on July 1st.  This is simply because I'd like to be at home with the baby for longer and I'm lucky in that I have a pretty easy, stress free job.  Obviously this is all dependant on baby and how my pregnancy progresses =)    Congrats x|`|rsCOEiDXaa	I worked up to the day I had my son (he came too 6 weeks early), but I would have probably starte my maternity leave a week before my due date. My problem is that my work only pays for 2 weeks of maternity leave full pay, then 2/3 pay for the following 4 weeks. So I ended up taking those 6 weeks only because I couldn't afford to stay home which broke my heart.    If I were you and you can afford to stay home longer, I would take at least 3 months.|`|s7OP3fxbaa	I plan on working up until I deliver and I will be taking 12 weeks.|`|AA11820380	My sister in law took hers about 2 Weeks before due date and she didn't go back until 5 months after baby was born.

X6as2nOAaa	Maybe just go to the doc to see. Sounds like a bug but you can just go up and talk to them.|`|ncHDtTKJaa	It sounds like you could have a virus or food posioning.

b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Your friends want your sperm or they think you should become a sperm donor for other random people?    Either way I wouldn't do it, especially if it's for your friends. It will be your biological child and you'll never get a chance to spend time with him/her or get a chance to raise your son or daughter. If your friends are going to raise your child, that's so awkward.    I was raised Catholic and, even if I wasn't, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Well, it really depends on how strict you are as a Catholic. You say you have done it before, so I say go and do it if you are comfortable with it.      If you are really debating it, go as a priest.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Thats up to you|`|h5q89E3Haa	No, you can not for reasons other than those you listed.    Catholic Dogma prohibits artificial insemination. The reason being is that if God intended for whomever to have a child he would see to it that they were blessed with one regardless of any medical condition.    See the following verses from Luke 1:
HvALvdc7aa	I had my gallbladder removed when I was 13 weeks. My baby is 8 weeks old now and very healthy. Good Luck!  It is a hard decision to make but your health is just as important.

1pNt9892aa	My son is 15months old and weighed in at 25 and a quarter pounds at his check up yesterday. That was the 50 percentile for his age.

XcgHH0lLaa	It's possible.    According to what I've read, sperm lives in the body for up to 5 days. So there is always that 'window' of opportunity.    Good luck.
t0jC2o0Jaa	"EW CM" is when it looks like egg whites or snot. It's clingy and stretches within your fingers. Sometimes it's cloudy and yellow or clear.    Aroused wetness is just a slimy feeling or a feel of wetness.

Every time we go to the mall I get a strawberry shortcake sundae at coldstone creamery.  :)  I found a webpage that sites the studies that put this food on the to avoid list so you can check it out for yourself.  http://barfblog.foodsafety.ksu.edu/tags/...|`|hSJWqNpiaa	Dont eat them..........

She's gaining weight normally and he fetuses are fine (twins!)
tbeO3Lataa	In the awful event that something did happen during labor (which I am sure it will not), the father would most likely be evaluated. If he did not gain custody, which it sounds like you are confident he wouldn't, the baby would go to either who you specify in your will, or the next of kin, i.e. a sister, mother etc.    Making a will is a good idea for anyone, pregnant or not, and in it you can put who you wish your child to go to in the event of an emergency. That person would be evaluated as well, and if you had suggested someone in particular, that is who would be considered. For example, if something happened to my parents, there will states I would go to my aunt. However, a few years ago they asked me who I would like to go to, and I said my older sister who is almost 18, so an adult. In the event they died, she would be evaluated, and I would go to her.    My mother is a lawyer, she's my source.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I believe it is a living will. Call some attorneys and talk it over with them and see. I'm in a similar situation.

QsbB6vkoaa	this is completely normal, it's just your uterus getting ready to carry a baby, just try taking a relaxing bath or lying down how ever you may feel comfortable. this usually goes away in a few weeks. but of course you will start feeling other symptoms like going to the bathroom every five minutes. but overall this is very normal and you will get to the point where you will learn to make yourself comfortable. what might work for some may not work for others and you will eventually learn what works for you.|`|claW4UUcaa	take a tums to ease your bubbly tummy or some infants mylicon drops.|`|DrFJfnpBaa	When i was 12-13 weeks pregnant I felt that way.

The sun canopy goes alot farther down so it covers a wider shade for the baby, and also i like how you can unzip the back so air can go through the stroller (that's what i did on hot summer days) Their is nothing i do not like about this stroller. definetly reccomend it to anyone!

Take care and try to stay patient as your guy begins to embrace his independence too!|`|598cSGVXaa	I would bet you anything that his astrological sign has nothing to do with his personality. I am a gemini, and I know many geminis who have nothing at all in common with me. Do you really believe that the stars have anything to do with how your child will behave? His nature will all depend on your own, your partner's, and how you raise him. Don't worry about Aries traits, just worry about how you will raise him.
Yn2n26zXaa	That doesn't mean anything. Things can change in a matter of hours. Don't worry Mona. No one has been pregnant forever. He will come when he is ready. The head is engaged and low, which is great. You can encourage labor by walking more and having sex. They also think that labor can be brought on by more calcium. So try eating a big bowl of chowder or eat some ice cream after sex :) Enjoy these last few weeks of pregnancy. You will miss them in a few months. Good luck!
IA5zVfk0aa	what a jerk for a mom, tell him to stand up for her, its your life and his life andyou guys made a baby! geeze plus if your out of high school and tried for a baby she needs to back off of him, i assume hes a grown man, so he needs to make decisions for himself and do what is best for you and the baby, good luck|`|p0prrzf2aa	his mom can't tell him what to do. thats HIS kid too. he needs to make decisions for himself...not his mother.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	Sweetie, you're confusing two issues. You and baby is one issue - - - what do you want? what's good for you?    Your boyfriend, his mum, his strength of character and all that is a different issue. . . . . and not for you to worry about. It's something  he has to deal with. let him deal with it.     You just stay focused on taking care of yourself and your baby. If he is old enough to make his own decisions, he will. Whatever he does, however old he is, he will choose how to behave. You will learn what kind of person/ dad / man he is.|`|NysFTExhaa	I've supplied a link to buy a paternity kit via walgreens so that you can get his mom off yours and his back about it (~ $20 is well worth that imo).  If he's 18 or older she really can't control him, only guilt him.  Don't let his mom keep him from being involved in the baby's life if he wants to be.    Good luck hun, hopefully when you prove it's his she'll cool off and accept it.      edit:  He's 21?  He should stand up to her in that case.  She may be his mom but you're the mother of his child.  She needs to let him run his life and realize he's an adult trying to do the right thing.|`|X6as2nOAaa	The best thing to do is to tell him he needs to make the decesion to wait for your mom to pay for the test and move in with you or he can kiss your butt. Don't you pay for the test that is ridiculous she is putting stress on you and you don't need that now. He needs to quit being such a wimp and grow some balls and stand up to his mother. Tell her that she can pay for it and you will get it done and tell him to make his decesion on what he wants to do. Either move in and let his mother be mad or stay home and only see the baby when you say ok.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	He needs to choose.  Stand up to his mom or maybe lose you.

Do what you think is best, I assume your boyfriend will also.|`|FKf67HXaaa	You know if it is his and he does probably too, so tell his mom if she wants this done she can pay for. Your boyfriend should stand up to her, hes going to be a dad. And you should let him know that if he doesn't do all the pregnancy things with you he will regret it later when she/he is born. I wouldn't stress it because you shouldn't be under stress right now. I would tell him to go and when the baby is born get it done and when it comes back his rub it all in her face. :)|`|gFiRi5xnaa	If he is 18, she can't stop him. You both know that that is his child, he can legally move out if he wants to, and he has total rights to sign the birth certificate. Then when he moves in with you if she continuously calls or comes by, you can call the cops and/or get a restraining order against you, the baby and even him. This is your and his child, she can't interfere if y'all are of age.|`|sjUNb9zXaa	Screw her, she has no say so here,if he feels like he does not need to get a test done ,then don't even bother with it. & if she doesn't want to help out ,than oh hell well shes the one missing out.|`|MnfPccp6aa	if she wants the test so bad why doesn't she pay for it.  I'm sure he should be old enough to make his own decisions.   his mother however, needs to chill off. she's not the one in the situation either way...your bf seriously needs to get some balls and stand up to his mother or else he'll just get pushed around by her forever. how old is he anyways?|`|98WKYtfwaa	How old is he? His mother can't tell him what to do whatever age he is, his mom sounds like she's just an ignorant cow, she can't control your boyfriend and if he cares about you and his unborn child then he WILL tell her to butt out and that it's upto him what he does. She might get mad and throw him out, but you arranged that he'd be moving in anyway.    She can't force a paternity test and she can't stop him going to your appointments and contributing towards the babys things.     In my opinion, even if you get the test done she will still be like this and try other ways to get her son out of being a dad. He's good he's being responsible and helping you, but his mother just needs to leave you too alone, she's gonna be a Grandmother, she should be happy, not being a b*tch and pushing you away.|`|AA10241709	These are the things that happen when you choose to get pregnant with someone who is not fully "grown up" and when you haven't thought of all of the consequences of it.  He's clearly still under his mother control and probably was before you got pregnant... there's nothing you can do about this.    I suggest you begin to find a way to pay for a paternity test to reassure his mother.  If he's not strong enough to talk to his mother himself, then all of the responsibility falls on you to take care of this child.  It's now time to be an independent woman.|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	very complicated! Have a serious talk with your boyfriend about his mother and about what HE wants for his baby not his mother.  If your brave enough, you could consider taking this to one of those tv talk shows where they try to fix problems like this and usually pay for any medical test etc. Or you could talk to professionals in confidentiality but this could cost some money.   Also, how old are you? because if you and your boyfriend are over 16 then his mother has no right to tell him what to do and if possible he could consider moving out and having some independence.    I hope I helped a little bit but this is quite a situation.  Best of luck!  xx|`|AA11206135	This is one of the major problems with having a baby with a "boyfriend" and not a HUSBAND  EDIT: Before I have a family? lol  I'm married and have 5 kids, 2 dogs, 3 cats... How much more "family" do I need?|`|Hi5h9739aa	I think he needs to step up and tell his mom to butt out.  How old are you both?  Tell the mother that is a court of law the father will pay for the paternity test.  So he will have to pay for it.  This to me is almost like a moment of truth.  Is he going to be there for you and the baby or is he going to be mommas boy forever.  Sadly it comes down to a choice for him and he needs to take responsibility despite what his mom says.  If he does not, well that is not a guy that I would want.....|`|IOU6zo9Raa	How old is your boyfriend?  I would have killed my husband if he had listened to his mother instead of the mother of his child. I have never gotten along with my mother in law. Tell her to pay for the damn test and have him take it if he is willing to, but in the mean time he really needs to go to your appointments and be there for you. He doesn't want to make his mother mad? OMG I don't even know what to say to you except that after you take that test I would get all three of you far away from her, and since she so doubted the paternity of your baby and basically called you a whore I would not want her involved, and I wouldn't take her help if she paid me to.|`|Ox2ojFCHaa	It depends, how old are you? If you and your BF are over 18 she can't control him that much. If you are under 18 she can control him like that. Still, to humor his mother get a paternity test. It will be the only way she will be sure and not be mad at you. I agree your BF's mother is being way to controling and should trust you more. After the test ask her if she would not mind paying for it, if she is the soon to be grandma, she should help with what she suggested.|`|9NC2CHQkaa	ok you guys dont seem to be young so I'm sure your boyfriend has a mind of his own and can make up his own mind. He doesnt have to listen to his mother nor can his mother stop him from being a father to your child. He HAS to put his foot down and tell her that he is not a child and will do what is right for his child and your soon to be family.    I dont know where you guys live but in Canada at the age of 16 you can live where ever you want  with out your parents concent. And if he wants the DNA test or his mother does then make her pay for it you have to provide for your family getting ready for a baby isnt cheap.    You both need to sit down with her and make it known and put her in her place. she has no right to say the things she has and to get invioved like she has.    Hope I helped.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Shouldn't have gotten involved involved with a mama's boy.    It's understandable for her to want a DNA.  She may know someone who has a son that thought he had a child and did the right thing only to find out it wasn't is.  If it's important to her tell her to pay for it.  If he refuses to sign without the DNA test you're going to have to suck it up and let it fly.  Encourage him to pay but if he refuses to pay and you want that signature then you're going to have to pay.  You should've considered this all before you started trying for a baby with a mama's boy.    Just because his mother forbids him from doing things doesn't mean he has to go along with it.  He's grown.  That's on him if he goes along with her and not you and you shouldn't have made a baby with someone that isn't ready to cut the cord with his mother.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	OK first of all...he is an adult and does not need to listen to his mother.  He needs to grow some balls and take hold of this situation by himself instead of trying to fall back on mommy for her thoughts.  if he wants to get a paternity test then let him get one, and he will pay for it...or better yet because the psycho wants it done make her pay for it.  What do u care if you already know the results of it.    He needs to be part of your pregnancy, he can not wait until the baby is born.  Talk to him tell him to cut his own umbilical cord from his mother.
meeYxKpwaa	Well if your not due to have your period until 2 weeks then it sounds to me your getting close to ovulation. My Dr told me at my last appt that its very hard for a women to get pregnant 5 days after her period but it does sound like its too early for implantation if you did happen or if you are pregnant|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	no this couldn't be implantation cu'z u only ovulated around the 27th of this month way to early. as for the discharge it "could " be the egg coming out. u wont know til feb 10th when u can test. sorry what your in the waitting game now..

Nipple stimulation, tell you partner to start sucking, could help. Massage of the perineum may also be encouraging and  it could also help you not to tear.   Take herbs at own risk I suggest looking it up further on the internet for your own peace of mind.
eryJKCpfaa	i say start taking them, Does your dr know you have not been taking them? if not, let them know. My dr, always asks if when she sees me|`|HF97Rs9qaa	The very first 3 months is when folic acid is the most important to prevent spinal bifida. But hopefuly you ate enough foods that contain it and I am sure by now you've had an ultra sound where it can be detected.    The iron is very important so you don't become anemic but if you have not been taking it and are not yet anemic you should be okay. Just eat high iron foods. Zinc is also important, well all the vitamins are important but some more than others.    I take mine off and on but I was VERY good about taking it in the first 3 months. Now I take it every other day but try to take DHA every day. I am in my 3rd trimester which is when DHA is most important.    As long as you eat healthy and a variety of foods you should be okay. Women had healthy babies before prenatal vitamins were invented.    If you start taking them, take them with a meal. If they make you sick then try a different brand. I take natures made, it is small and easy on my tummy and has everything he and I need in a multi vitamin. Also I suggest taking  DHA.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	it won't hurt you or the baby.... folic acid is really something that you need to be taking before you get pregnant anyway....  I'm 39 weeks with my 2nd baby and I think I might have taken 20 prenatal vitamins this whole pregnancy... and not many more with my first baby either.... I was really sick and they made it a lot worse...  I try to take the gummy-vitamins for kids when I can keep them down... mostly the vitamins are for the mother to try to recoup what the baby is taking out of them... like if you aren't getting enough calcium the baby will take it right from your bones  the baby gets what it needs any way it can.. you are the one that suffers....|`|mPTBU0QDaa	No, if you start taking them now, it can only make things better. The most critical time to take them is in the first three months when so many things in your baby are forming. Now they are mostly just growing bigger and maturing. It is still important, though.    Many women don't know they are pregnant for awhile or throw up their vitamins every day, and their babies are okay. I hope that yours is too! Next time try to be a little bit better about remembering.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	No of course it wont hurt you or the baby. Just start taking them again.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	you should keep taking them, starting now shouldn't harm the baby, Folic acid is important to take before you get pregnant,as well as during to help prevent defects, and spinabifida ,  the prenatal vitamins, you take through out your entire pregnancy , are just to ensure that your unborn baby is getting the right nutrients, especially since it is so hard to control or intake of proper healthy portions these days.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No it wouldn't be bad to start now, it's probably better taking them late than not at all.    We all forget them sometimes, i was religiously taking my prenatal vitamin from conception up until 14weeks, now i forget every so often and when i look back i've missed 2/3 days worth of them. I don't feel guilty though because i eat a good diet, so i know i'm getting good nutrition, but the vitamins do help alot though.
ibWLdXlJaa	You can buy Mylicon drops from the store. It's safe for newborns and she can take it before every feeding if needed to help her with gas.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Is she breast fed or formula fed? Breast fed babies rarely get constipated but if she's on formula that very well may be the case, especially with it just being tiny pebbles in the diaper.    With her only being 12 days old I wouldn't recommend anything like juice to help her bowels along. Has her cord stump fallen off yet? If so give her a nice, warm, bath and kind of let her "soak" in it for awhile. You can also massage her belly and do gentle bicycle kicks with her legs. All these should help her muscles relax and hopefully get her bowels going again.    You can also stimulate her bowels with a thermometer(vaseline on the tip) but I'd try other things before resorting to this.|`|vewYW4wcaa	She might have gas bubbles in her tummy, or maybe something in your milk is upsetting her tummy. try Ovol drops for babies, it works wonders!|`|j1xmCCbvaa	I think all babies tend to go red in the face - having a poo is a very strange feeling for them and probably quite unpleasant at first.  She's just struggling to get to grips with it I'd say.  My daughter used to cry every single time she tried to have a poo, but she wasn't constipated, just didn't like the feel of it.    I'd be fairly reassured but obviously still head for that doctor's appointment to be sure.    I hope it's nothing and your baby remains healthy.  Congratulations on your new arrival!|`|BMhPpnuMaa	my baby is 3 months old, and when he was 1st born he had trouble doing a poo, like u described, they are not expected to do a poo every single day,they are only on liquid. but he is fine now just does smelly poo as bottle fed now :)
5obUB1KIaa	Typically babies get weaned from formula into drinking whole milk when they turn one.  That helps build healthy and strong bones. Ask your doctor at your next visit about when would be a good time to consider weaning your baby to whole milk.  Don't do rice milk.  It lacks the nutrients necessary for your babies healthy development.|`|yGPRntXFaa	No dont give your baby rice milk... should never change the formula unless your doctor tells you to... bring the formula and the rice milk to your baby s next check up and have the doctor compare them to make sure that your baby is getting what he or she needs.....

The first known surviving set of healthy septuplets was born in the U.S. to the McCaugheys in November of 1997.  In 1998, the U.S.s first set of octuplets was born in Houston, Texas.   And the octuplets born a few days ago.  Octuplets is still the record as recorded so far with all children surviving.

If it did happen the babies wouldn't do well.  I am sure it is possible to get pregnant with that many babies, but to sustain them all through pregnancy would be almost impossible and almost cruel.

c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	I am so sorry you are not getting positive home pregnancy tests (hpt) but have you had the blood test yet? It is not over until then. I have known several women get negative hpt and then get a positive blood test! I do hope this is the case for you!    As for getting your period, I got mine 4 days after stopping medications for 3 of my failed IVF cycles.|`|EitNmbUNaa	I'm sorry about your IVF.  I hope you have more success in the future.  You will likely start your period two weeks after you stopped taking the medication.  It's slightly different for everyone, but that is the average.  BTW, if you are going to do IVF again,  you might want to try the   E-tegrity Test first.  I used it after two failed IVFs.  The test checks endometrial receptivity prior to IVF. Good luck. I know it's frustrating but know you're not alone!

Soothers also reduce the risk of SIDS|`|aJLx0nhNaa	SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion.  No one knows why certain babies die suddenly in their cribs.  A SIDS diagnosis is basically the same thing as saying "We have no idea why he died, but it seems similar to other babies who have died in this manner."    Unfortunately, you cannot prevent it for certain.  That's why it stresses moms out so much.    There are some factors that you have no control over.  For example, boys seem to die of it more than girls.  No one knows why, but that seems to be the case.    There are some things that seem to make it less likely.  Putting your baby to sleep on his back, in a plain crib with no blankets, bumpers or stuffed animals.  Smoking around a baby is associated with SIDS, so don't do that.  Use of a pacifier is associated with a decrease in SIDS, so use one.    All these tips are based on educated guesses by doctors.  They looked closely at the lives of babies who died of SIDS and then compared what factors in their lives were more common.  So it's not clear if any of these things actually cause or prevent SIDS.  You never know, that's why it's so frightening.|`|HF97Rs9qaa	There are a lot of studies that have been done which link SIDS to several different things.    There are things that can be done to help prevent it...    Mold is a scary one, the chemicals in the child mattresses that is a flame retardant is shown to turn in to a toxic gas when the mattress has mold. It is activated by the body heat of your baby and for a full size adult would not kill it but it is dangerous for an infant. Do not buy a used mattress, keep the mattress clean and mold free.    Another study links anephelactic shock to SIDS. The child will have formula or ingest something it is allregic to and then you put the baby to bed and it goes in to anephelactic shock. That is why breastfeeding is important.    Also never put a lot of blankets and pillows in with baby.    Lay them to sleep on their back.    Keep pets off and away from them while they sleep.    be sure to not overheat them and keep the room temperature at the right setting.    And buy a cetified crib from a good company and a certified mattress that is hard.    No smoking at all, even if you smoke outside it can still harm your baby.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	dont put baby to sleep in a cot HEHHEHEHEEHHE|`|yGPRntXFaa	what is cot...?  I know about SIDS...

I have a tommee tippee one, and its put my mind at ease so much.  A little green light flashes every time your baby breathes or moves, and if baby doesnt breathe for 20 seconds, an alarm sounds which will wake you up.  Well worth the money.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	There is a lot of new research on SIDS...  they think that they have found a gene that is the cause of it but until there is a test that they can do on every baby the recommendations are that you put your baby to sleep on their back on a firm mattress,  have no loose blankets or bedding around them, run a fan in the room and don't have a co-sleeping or family bed going on because of your bedding and the chances that you could roll over onto them... also there are pads that you can get to put under their sheet that has an alarm if the baby stops breathing for more then like 30 seconds.
ZYlr9TSBaa	I felt them in my back at first, then they gradually started going from my back to my front. Bloody hurt too lol.    ETA: You will know the difference between cramping and contractions.

Visits to the doctors are kept confidential after the age of 13 if the child goes unaccompanied by their parents. The doctor will not divulge anything from the appointment without the patient's consent. So your friend can go to her doctor to ask for a prescription for the pill knowing without her mum knowing. When I was put on the pill, I wasn't given an examination "down there".... it should be the same for your friend, although I can't think why she'd be given one. At most, her blood pressure *might* be taken, but don't hold me to that, and she will have to answer some questions.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No they can't tell your parents about getting on the pill, if they were too it would be breaking the patients confidentiality and you'd be able to sue them.

UXI8k7y6aa	My daughter was diagnosed with silent reflux from day one. Silent reflux is when nothing actually comes up and out it only comes up to a certain point and then goes back down causing them to gag and choke on it. My daughters PED prescribed her Zantac but that only helped for a week she was then given solutabs Prevacid and I didn't see a huge difference with that either. I am the type of mother that sees giving a newborn/infant meds is risky and would rather just stay away from them. In the end to make a long story short I ended up taking her to a chiropractor after she was about 1 month. She was cured from reflux by the time she was 3 months. She is now 1 year old and we haven't had a problem since. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.|`|M5XjqI40aa	All babies have reflux that why they are always spitting up.|`|fHjSonssaa	Our son NEVER fussed when he was spitting up- and he DEFINATELY had reflux.  We couldn't lie him down without him throwing up his entire meal   because of the reflux- and he didn't fuss- even when he threw up.    Instant fix- and miracle worker- the AR Pillow.    www.arpillow.com    I found this website and showed it to my DR- she was grateful that I showed it to her- and she wrote my son a prescription for one.  Insurance covered it- and even if it doesn't, $70- BUT A LIFE SAVER for a baby with refulx.  He never spit up/threw-up again after we started using this pillow.  He still sleeps on it because he's used to it and he's 10 months old.      Other great things about the pillow- they used to just prop the matress up with wedge- - the AR pillow (which is a wedge) lets you comfortably strap/harness baby in.  It let me sleep knowing my son was safe.  We had previously tried to elevate his bassinett pad slightly and his little body would be all smushed at the bottom - it happened once and it frightened me!!  This wedge also lets you co-sleep safely- because baby is raised up.  Just look at the website and you'll know what I mean.  He was originally on meds because he had reflux so bad- but once we started using this pillow, we took him off the meds right away because he didn't need them anymore.  I really don't know what I would have done without this.  (I should work for them, right?)    I myself am NOT a DR- I am however strongly disagreeing with your DR right now due to experience.  Not all babies are going to fuss!!!    THe meds for reflux work, but not as good as the pillow- he would still spit up, just less.  With the pillow- unless he was bounced around right after a meal (swing- we learned our lesson)- he was great.  And comfortable.  Good news is, they grow out of reflux usually before they are one- if not before.  My son grew out of it all together by the time he was 5 months- but like I said- he still loves sleeping on the wedge (although he is 10 months and has recently learned to unstrap himslef and wiggle out to stand in his crib.  Luckliy he only does this in the morning).      CHeck the website out-

This will sound really heartless but trust me it has to be done, & now before your baby gets any older.   First of all set a time you want your baby in bed. Say 8pm.  At 6.30pm bath your baby, Johnson's lavender is good.  Once out the bath gently massage your baby with lotion (it's relaxing)  Dress your baby for bed, clean nappy & give him/her a bottle.  7.45pm take your baby to bed in silance.  Lay the baby in the cot with NO light & turn on the baby monitor.  Your baby MAY start to cry, you MUST ignore this. Just sit on the stairs or outside the door.  If he/she does not stop crying in 10 mins without turning on the light just check he/she is ok but do not pick him up.  If your baby has not stopped crying after 15 minutes scoop him up again keep lights off) and rock him, try gently running your index finger from his forehead to the tip of his nose (this encourages him to close his eyes)  Once she has calmed down place her back in the cot and repeat.   Once you have not heard the baby cry for 10 to 15 minutes just creep in and check baby is asleep.  This may take a few days to get to where once in the cot he will just go to sleep but it is worth it & it does not harm the baby at all.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	don't forget to swaddle well or use a swaddler...and use some white noise; a fan is supposed to reduce sids, we use that and a womb bear...she loves the bear sound and she's seven mos...|`|gHRbi3c5aa	very unlikely! you need to wait a bit longer cos they still need to feed during the night and babies feel the slightest change in temperature so if you can keep the room temp constant you'll have a bit more of a chance but not everyday. sorry.|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	Have you got your baby into a bath, bottle, bed routine yet, if not start there.

vwcDdNfcaa	oh yes hunny that sounds like teething to me  wash your hands and rub her gum line if you feel little pointy things  she is teething! it is a beautiful thing but very painful for children.  contact your doctor and make an appt. to be on the safe side  the symptoms are:    Irritability:  As the sharp little tooth rises closer to the surface your babys gums may become increasingly more sore and painful, leading to your baby being very fussy.  The pain and discomfort is most often worse during the first teeth coming in and later when the molars come in because of their bigger size.  This is most often the case since babies become accustomed to the sensations of teething and learn to live with them.  But you may find your baby may be fussy during the whole time that every tooth comes in.  Every child reacts differently.     Drooling:  From three to four months of age you may see your baby start drooling more often than normal.  Teething stimulates drooling, which is often worse with some babies than others.     Coughing:  The extra saliva can cause your baby to occasionally cough or gag.  This is usually nothing to worry about as long as your baby seems fine and shows no signs of a cold or flu and does not run a high fever.     Chin rash:  If your baby is a big drooler, the constant contact with saliva can cause the skin around the chin and mouth to become irritated.  To help prevent this, gently wipe your babys mouth and chin periodically throughout the day.     Biting & gnawing:  A baby that is teething will gnaw and gum down on anything she or he can get their mouth around.  The counter pressure from biting on something helps relieve the pressure from under the gums.     Cheek rubbing and ear pulling:  Pain in the gums may travel to the ears and cheeks particularly when the back molars begin coming in.  This is why you may see your baby rubbing their cheeks or pulling at their ears.  However, keep in mind that pulling at an ear can also be a sign of an ear infection.     Diarrhea:  While this is a symptom that is disagreed upon by physicians, researchers and parents, most parents usually notice slightly looser bowel movements when a baby is teething.  While the recent study done by the Childrens Hospital in Australia found this to be the most common symptom of teething, there are still many people that will agree and disagree with this recent study. It is believed that the most likely cause of this is the extra saliva swallowed, which then loosens the stool.  Be sure and report any diarrhea to your doctor that lasts more than two bowel movements.     Low-grade fever:  A fever is another symptom that doctors are sometimes hesitant to directly link with teething.  But there are many parents who will disagree with this and find their baby gets a slight fever while teething.  The best thing to do is be extra safe and notify your doctor if a fever last more than two days.    Not sleeping well:  With teething pain happening during the day and night, you may find your child wakes more often at night when the pain gets bad enough.  Most parents agree that the night waking happens more often during the first set of teeth and with the molars.     Cold like symptoms (runny nose, etc.):  Some parents find that their baby will show signs of having a cold.  Runny noses, coughing and general cold symptoms are believed to come from the baby having their hands in their mouth more often.  Play it safe and always notify your doctor if symptoms such as this occur.       What can you do for your child  There are several things that you can try to help ease the pain of teething; some work and some dont, but most parents agree theyre always worth a try.  Teething rings, water filled and chilled rubber teething toys; mom and dads fingers can all provide counter pressure that can sometimes bring relief.  Offering your baby a cold bottle of water can also help.  If sucking on the bottle bothers your child, offer a cold cup of water.  The water can also help replenish your babys fluid if theyre drooling a lot or have loose bowel movements.     Cold food has also been found to be helpful by some parents.  Chilled applesauce, yogurt and pureed peaches may be more appealing to your baby and also more nutritious than a chilled teething ring.     When nothing else helps, you can also turn to the Infant Tylenol.  Before giving your child Infant Tylenol (acetaminophen) always check with your doctor first.  Your doctor will tell you if its all right and what the proper amount is to give your baby.  Baby Orajel and other teething pain medicines that are applied to the gums can also provide some relief.  Some parents say the Baby Orajel type products work great, while other parents will say it doesnt.  Also check with your doctor before giving this type of over the counter pain reliever to your baby.     The teething process will come and go just like so many other things with new babies.  Keep trying different things until you find what will work.    Please check with your docotor though before trying anyone above your childs doctor whats what is best for her|`|3klIx1Egaa	is she drooling alot? cause it sounds like teething. wash your hands really well and feel her gums and see if you feel a bump.

So expect your daughter to get teeth at around the age of 5mths, but it could be sooner!    give her lots of things to bite - she'll likely want to bite your finger the most lol    if she gets too upset you can ease things with some infant pain relief medicine.    i take my son to the doctor once a month for a check up and anyother time i'm worried about him. He's 4mths old and we've been to the doctor 5 times so far.    the symptoms for teething are:  irritablity  sensitive mouth (may refuse food if it hurts or want more because it hurts)  biting things  drooling more then usual  runnier poos  temps  changes in sleep pattern    at 3mths children begin to drool. and boy of boy do they drool!! its very healthy for them and even though its messy, it's a good thing.   biting chewing or liking hands can be out of exploration! at this age children learn that they have hands, and they can explore them at will by putting them in thier mouths. they also like to explore the drool with their hands, so hands in mouth is just the beginning! next step is exploring everything else with their mouth --- dirt, toys, clothes, POO, sheets, everything.  so it could just be this and not teething at all? put a clean finger in her mouth and massage her gums, if it's swollen, its teething, if not.. likely not teething just yet.|`|C0WRHLbhaa	She may be teething wash your hands and stick your finger in her mouth to feel her gums you may feel a tooth. my son was teething at 3 months got his teeth at 4 months|`|0zkCGlNUaa	I have 3 month old triplets myself.

Ours started teething at 3 months.  We didn't feel a tooth about to come through until 3 months though.  Some babies are fussy at this age when they need a nap. Sounds like she may have had a mild cold or it was just teething.  Ours does this off and on but hasn't had a cold I don't think.      Our pediatrician told us to call whenever we had a question.  Picking up the phone a few times has kept us from going crazy.      I would go to the doctor if she starts getting breathing problems or a high fever.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Sounds to me like its the onset of teething.  Get a teething ring, one that you can put in the fridge so its cool in her mouth.  Give her infant paracetamol when shes fretting.  A nice bath always used to work wonders with my little fella.  Also watch out for a sore bottom too.
puCOYwMmaa	It's way too early.  If you are pregnant it's barely even implanted in your uterus yet.  Your body doesn't start making room like that until your uterus reached your belly button which is about 5 months.      If you're focused on whether or not you're pregnant then you're probably reading a lot into every ache and symptom you feel (I did it when I was trying to get pregnant).  It's probably either nothing or bloating.|`|QH5oOFutaa	wayyyyyyyyyyy too early. the reason for ur ribs hurting while pregnant is because your baby is kicking them, resting his/her foot on it, punching it or pushing his/her body up against it. If your ribs are hurting, you need to go see a Dr    EDIT:  Sweetie....Ive been an RN in L&D for a little over 6 years now, and I graduate as a PA OBGYN in June. Ive had 2 kids and Im pregnant with number 3. Your ribs do start hurting, yes. But you are BARELY pregnant, if you are at all. So there is something else going on with your body that is making your ribs hurt. If you are pregnant, your uterus is wayyyy below your belly button...and wont reach your belly button until about week 20, so this is not your baby, uterus or anything else BUT a possible injury to your ribs hurting you. Good luck if you are pregnant and congrats|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	u should go see your doctor it happened to me when was abot 26 to 30 weeks and my doctor said its because i was laying on my side and the weight was causing it to hurt but i doubt you gained alot of weight if not any

YXWmaOryaa	If the implant is put in during the first five days of your period you will be immediately protected against pregnancy. If the implant is put in on any other day you will not be protected against pregnancy for the first seven days after it has been fitted. So you will need to use another method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time. hope this helps xx|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Good question!

ye9h4s2Laa	hi,    I had the same problem with my son who is now 10months.  She hs just got used to being fed when she wakes at night, what i done was when he did wake, i gave him a sip of water to settle him.  He soon started sleeping straight through. They really don't need the night feed when have been weaned onto solids.|`|pXSKSS3daa	"but I just wondered at what age should I expect her to sleep the 12 hours without a feed?"    When she does it on her own. There is no set age for this, babies/children will do so on their own time and not ours.    I also don't believe it's a habit for a baby to wake until they are much older(around the year mark). At 6 months your baby is still waking due to hunger. She's sleeping 7-9 hours at a time, that's pretty good. Have you tried putting her down later, though? At that age(and still) my son was going down between 8 and 8:30 at night. This may or may not push back that early morning feed but it's worth a try if you want(and if your daughter obliges).|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My pediatrician told me that I might be able to expect my son to want a middle of the night feeding until 9 months.  He seems (knock on wood!) to be sleeping through without it lately (he's 7 months.)  But I'd keep giving it to her until she decides she doesn't need it anymore.|`|yGPRntXFaa	Give her at least to a year. My daughter did the same....|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Well, I sometimes wake up hungry in the middle of the night and I just turned 30.......And my 6 month old daughter nurses at least once or twice every night|`|RDZzKsflaa	That sounds fine to me, she's only 6 months after all. I think you'll be able to gradually stop the feeding in the night by changing what you do with her when you go in to see to her. Instead feeding, sing to her or just cuddle her. Then after a while, you'll be able to stop going in and she'll sleep for the full 12 hours. My mum made the mistake of coming into see me whenever I cried, so I became very very attatched and as I got a bit older, I wouldn't sleep without her being in the room. So, it's just a gradual process, but it should work. :)|`|qjDxKXENaa	you may need to change her milk to hungrier baby milk, otherwise every baby is not the same. my daughter is 5 and a half months old and she sleeps through the night and she has meals druing the day only breakfast and dinner.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	She probably doesn't need to wake up to eat right now, but she is young enough you can continue giving it to her. A six month old doesn't need to eat in the middle of the night. It sound like a comfort thing, I would try to end the feedings by using alternate ways of soothing her when she wakes at night. Rubbing her back, rocking her, singing a song. In a few months you shouldn't even go in her room, that way she will get her self back to sleep.|`|kw80YHMLaa	I think she's doing ok every child is different. At 6 months she's still a baby finding her routine i would worry at all!!! Maybe try putting her to bed a little later that 6.45pm and give her a bath before bed u'd be surprised in it's difference.|`|YXWmaOryaa	Its so tricky as each baby is different, my daughter slept for 12 hours a night from when she was 2 months old untill she was 6 months and we tried to move her into her own room. shes now 7 monhts and still not sleeping in her own room, but she is not waking for a bottle she just cant seem to settle in a different room!! But anywya the wy I got her to go through the night without a feed was initially to give her only water through the night, then gradually changed this to a dummy which I kept putting in whenever she woke up and eventually she stopped waking at all. My friend had said to me before hand 'if someone gives you a bar of chocolate at 3am every morning you will wake up for it' so its the same kind of thing, if she stops gettint it she wont wake up for it and then will hopefully sleep for 12 hours then wake up and enjoy her breakfast. Dont let other peoploe worry u by saying how good thier baby is coz she sleeps through the night coz they are all different and have different needs x
a0rmkwf8aa	i think you should test. that spotting could be implantation spotting.bleeding. this usually happens 7-10 DPO. every woman's body is different so anything is possible. Good Luck. Keep us informed if you dont mind.|`|AA10838327	i think u should test and see what happens good luck to you|`|OeXFNQXYaa	you should test and see if your pregant good luck and best wishes
0Sv8PiH9aa	Those were my symptoms and I am due in 2 weeks!! There is a pretty good chance :)|`|IOU6zo9Raa	You can take a hpt like four days before your expected period. the discharge is what tipped me off the first time i was pregnant. I've never had breast pain but many women do. I think you have a few pregnancy symptoms, but the major one is lack of menstration, and your gonna have to wait and see, or buy a few tests. If you test to early you will probably get a negative which can be false.
QH5oOFutaa	It happens all the time. Just make sure you dont drink anymore. Congrats|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Don't worry about it, your baby will be fine.  It's the women who continue to get trashed every night after they find out they were pregnant that have something to worry about it.|`|AA11785285	You mean, you had unprotected sex, with a guy for whom you didn't much care, were not in a solid relationship, and he trashed you?  Or by Trashed, do you mean drunk?    First question, is do you wish to be a parent?    Are you in a solid relationship?    You have the same three choices any of us have with an unwanted pregnancy....carry to term and keep, carry to term and adopt out, abort.    And only you know if you:  1.wish to spend the next 2 decades rasing a child you never planned for or  2.having a child and giving it away,  or   3.abort a zygote.      What would I do?  I would have been on free bc from Planned Parenthood and never gotten pregol.

I've asked my doctor about this because before i knew i was pregnant i was taking, medications, drinking, smoking, and she said it really wouldn't have effected the child at that stage, and it should be fine as long as i've stopped as soon as i found out. But now that you know of course , you won't be drinking for another year or so.|`|faueyTBvaa	I have never been "trashed" so I wouldn't have that to worry about.. but if you did however I would suggest just taking care of yourself from now on, take prenatal vitamins and start seeing the doctor for prenatal care.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	Herbal teas could cause spontaneous abortion but it depends how far along she is. If it's more than two weeks forget it, she simply needs to go to Planned-Parenthood, tell them she has no money or support system ( that way it will be cheaper) and use this as a learning experience to grow the f@&$ up. Also the pill method is better than vacuum aspiration. Yes, I know how callous this sounds, so don't slam me. I've had an abortion ( the pill method) it made me grow up and turned out to be to pivotal moment in my long-term relationship because of everything it pushed to the surface, I am now the happy mother of a seven-week old because I was/am ready for it now.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Try talking to her because what if this tea doesnt work and just ends up hurting the baby. That is so dumb tell her to grow up and take some responsibilty and tell her to go see a doc.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You can try to talk to her but she's got to do what she thinks is best for her.  The tea may not work for her the way she wants it to.  She's got to make her own mistakes.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	If she wants to have an abortion, she should have a *real* abortion overseen by medical professionals--not drink some herbal tea which may not do anything but make her sick. It's a decision that only she can make, but she should be well-informed going into it. If you ask me, "to keep a new guy she's known for a week" is not a legitimate reason to abort a fetus. Sounds like you are much more mature and rational than your friend.   :)|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Well tell her to go to planned parenthood, then instead of being stupid.  Then I hope the guy breaks up with her, after she aborts her baby.  Then we can see how she really feels.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	your friend is irresponsible and stupid, she wanted to get pregnant so she has to go through with it, if she tries to abort herself she could wind up killing herself. she should have the baby and put it up for adoption, if she is going to go through with an abortion then she needs to get it done by a doctor, and her tubes tied while she is at it because she dose not deserve to EVER be a mother. If i was her friends i would tell her what im tellin you now and if she still doesn't listen then i would find new friends|`|YA192EYZaa	Talk to her and tell her not to get an abortion. Its WRONG.|`|NI8D46J0aa	I am not sure if talking to her will help, but if she didn't use contraception on purpose, then she needs to take responsibility for what she's done.  It's no the baby's fault she was being irresponsible. I think you are a good friend for caring about her baby, even if she doesn't. Maybe you will be able to talk some sense into her.  Good luck.|`|vweoheAvaa	I don't understand.....Does she know whether this guy she's interested in would be ok with her having a baby, even if it isn't his? She should talk to him & find out what he thinks(if she hasn't already). As far as whether you should talk to her, that's your decision. If you feel that's the best thing to do, then talk to her. Otherwise, leave it alone.|`|mfnugUZJaa	If she wants to be stupid and have an abortion based off some guy she barley knows then that's her choice. But you should try to convince her to, at least, get it done properly by a doctor.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	Your friend is being incredibly selfish, ending her babies life because she's unhappy with her own romantic decisions is just wrong, besides , losing a child is very hard on the mind and the body, if she chooses to try and abort the pregnancy there is always a chance that she could become sterile, and never have a choice to be a mother again.|`|14Mxe74Uaa	Well by having a baby with someone that shwe is not with anymore she is just adding to the problem in society where kids are brought in to the world by parents not a family.  It is pretty bad when you don't here someone refer to the other as my wife/husband or at least boyfriend/girlfriend you hear My baby's mom or my baby's dad.  Why do you think there is a downfall in society.  But to answer your question I think what you should do is help society out and push her down the stairs or just boot her in the belly.  That way she don't even have to go to the Dr.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	thats what happened to my friend, she got pregnant by her ex and got together with a new guy, she told him she was pregnant and he said her would stay with her and theyve been together for a while, she should talk to him, if hes up to it and will help her she can keep it... what about the ex? does he know?|`|qq159sWMaa	Okay first off having an abortion is her choice but she should be making it for the right reasons.  If she and her former bf were already considering having a child then maybe they should talk about this and go over why they broke up in the first place.  As someone who regretfully has had an abortion and thinks about that baby everyday I would say think good and hard about it and DON'T let some guy be the reason you have one, he might not always be there but the regret and guilt will.  If she does go through with it as a friend be there for her.|`|Eyhq5k5Faa	that baby did not ask to be put there. its murder.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I'm pro-choice, but having an abortion when you didn't mind getting pregnant and weren't using any type of protection is just stupid. It's also stupid to end a pregnancy simply because you aren't with the father anymore.  She's horribly selfish, and in my opinion, doesn't deserve the privilege of being pregnant.|`|B2HxSOGZaa	Her not using contraceptives is her fault in the first place. If she didn't want the possibility of troubles with this new guy then she never should've have slept with her ex at all. She has no idea what kind of hurt she will put herself through if she does get an abortion. It will haunt her for life. That baby may not have any say in this, but its not the babies fault for being conceived, its her and her exes selfishness.|`|emgIjPqMaa	how does herbal tea do anything?  how old is she?  and if she didnt care about getting pregnant why would she get an abortion   id would usually say get a abortion for the best but maybe she can put it up for adoption|`|lEkpWSeEaa	I know that abortion seems like it can sometimes be a way out of a situation that you don't want to be in, but it's not.  I think if she had an abortion she would think of how horrible it was every day of her life and just to inform her, after you have an abortion, you are less likely to concieve a child when you actully want to.  When I was a senior in high school (I had a wild streak) and I got drunk and slept with a guy in my senior class....low & behold I got pregnant...and I didn't tell anyone for about 3 months...then I told 2 of my friends...and until I was 7 months pregnant, only those 2 friends knew about it...I know that sounds really bad, but I had no clue what to do.  I looked at it as ruining my life...but really it changed my whole life!  I only gained 13-14 pounds during the pregnancy, that's why it was so easy to conceal, but now my little girl is almost 4 years old and it is the best decision ever to keep her.  She is the most precisious gift in the world and not a day goes by that I don't consider myself lucky to have her.  When I was 7 months pregnant I met an awesome guy, he knew I was pregnant and knew the whole situation, he liked me for me and 4 years later we are still together and he treats my daughter like her own.  So if your friend is going to terminate her pregnancy just to get with the next guy in line...tell her to grow up and take soem responsibility.  If the guy doesn't want to be with her because she is pregnant than it isn't ment to be.  The baby is helpless, you need to help the baby!
Wc3Vge9taa	as soon as your baby can eat table food.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	6 months and beyond|`|zQAWuMN4aa	not before 8 months.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	6-8 months|`|OO6Apkgfaa	probably 6 - 8 months x|`|z7a9F4HNaa	start after 8 months.
dZxjXHA2aa	It is wrong.  Formula is made without certain chemicals to protect babies but this also means it begins dissolving as soon as it made.  Formula is only good for about an hour after it's made, after that you should toss and start fresh.  Her baby will have tummy troubles if she keeps it up|`|pXSKSS3daa	Ew. Ask her if she'd like to drink milk that's been sitting out for 3 hours.    Seriously, I cannot stand when people say "I did this/that and I'm/my baby is just fine." So? That doesn't mean it will stay that way or that everyone will get that lucky.    Leaving a bottle out or not discarding it before that initial first hour is risking bacteria. It's just not healthy. Please tell her to read the side of her formula can, it states this right there.|`|ISjFdI1taa	2 or 3 hours for a 9 month old baby is OK - no longer than that though.  I wouldn't leave formula any longer than 1 hour for a newborn though.|`|MQ34YW28aa	on the can of the formula it says throw away after a hour of making it. but that's to just save their butt. it wont hurt them if it's a few hours. i don't do that, i did by accident a few times grabbing the other bottle that was sitting next to me from the last feeding and it didnt' bother him at all. My little brother i remember found a bottle that was a week old and caught him drinking it, he drank rest of it until i found him and it didn't bother him. YUCK!!! but all kids end up finding that bottle that is old and drink it and it don't bother them.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	well it depends on if teh bottle was sterilized before the milk went in the bottle and the weather.|`|3klIx1Egaa	as the first response says, it says one hour to save there butts, But i asked my nurse at the baby and me clinic when my son was first born, and she said at max its good for 3 hours.. I would never use it after an hour tho|`|j1xmCCbvaa	I've got a 6 month old baby and I was told by my midwife that anything up to 2 hours is fine.  My baby very occasionally had the last bit of her bottle just over 2 hours after it had been heated and she's a healthy girl!    I should also say that it's strange that your friend is allowing her baby to 'snack' on her bottle like that.  If the baby is still wanting more milk after 2 hours then perhaps she needs more substance at each feed?  Is she being fed baby food too?  If she's giving it to the baby because she thinks it's thirsty then that's wrong, as milk isn't a drink, it's food, and she should be giving the baby cooled boiled water instead.  Just a thought!|`|kw80YHMLaa	i agree over 30 minutes i throw out my twins bottles it's not worth them becoming sick over being lazy
Zx8uw3I2aa	okay, first of all, calm down hun, its not gonna help your nerves if your distressed..   my mum and two of my sisters have had their boobs done and have ALL been terrified beforehand.. its perfectly normal to feel this way..!!   its going to be painful afterwards, and you should know that because your doctor/practintioner would have talked you through it all.. everyones pain thresholds are different, with my mum, it hurt alot, but one of my sisters said it only hurt for about a week and a half..  it all depends how big you are now, and how big your going to be really.. im sure the hospital will give you drugs to help the pain and swelling so dont worry too much!!   its going to be an AMAZING result in the end.. keep thinking of being able to walk into a lingerie shop and buyin really nice bras [:  i doubt you'll decide not to go through with it, and if you do, then your boobs obviously dont bother you too much lol!!  good luck on monday, will be thinking of you and your new look (:    take care xx|`|8OoqHpbIaa	i had mine done with transform 2 yrs ago in london  you just go to sleep and wake up like after a  nights sleep but it feels like about 5 mins later and you have boobs its pretty cool    then after you go home thats when it really hurts and you cant do anything for yourself drive or lift etc even sitting up is hard so make sure you have someone to stay with you    its great ive never looked back i went from a b -dd  good luck    EDIT:also make sure you have a sports bra for the size your going up to if you can get the one with silver threaded through as it prevents infection    i forgot to buy one and had to buy one at the hopital place and it was well overpriced!!
SIhEme03aa	I just used the hospital gowns. The nurses come in to exam you and make sure you're healing properly and not bleeding too much. Its just easier to have the gown on and not have to worry about getting your own pjs all bloody. Believe me, you'll be bleeding like crazy the first 24 hours after. I'm sure the room will be warm enough, even if it is winter.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	If you bring pajamas, get the button down shirt ones, I'm sure you can find some flannel or fleece(which you can't find anything more comfortable). That way for the most part you can still stay warm and you can just undo the first couple of buttons. You could get the stretchy ones, but after a while the neck might be kind of wide.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	yeah even if its winter you DONT need fuzzy warm clothes. You should bring summery pajamas with a matching robe for if you get a little cold. GO sleeveless so you can nurse easier if you want.|`|58d34da1292dde1e2adf19fa22f4fdbeaa	Make sure you bring slippers, Lanisoh (for your nipples), nuks (they charge $10 for one nuk if you get it from the hospital), your camera, and nursing bras.  I brought my own pajamas for my second child and I was a lot more comfortable, but if you're bleeding a lot you'll want to ruin their gowns, not your clothes.  As for the kind of pajamas you bring, that's up to you.  I like having something button-down when I'm breast feeding, but don't bring down the neck of a cami, you'll stretch it out.  You'll want to keep a nursing bra on 24/7 until you're done breast feeding.  That way your boobs won't sag after you wean the baby.|`|kw80YHMLaa	tank top pj's easiest for breastfeeding but if u are a cold person u may prefer button up fleece ones. what ever u are more comfortable in its your body.|`|vewYW4wcaa	Its usually quite warm in the maternity wing, i suggest cotton capri and tank top style pajamas, as it easiest to pull down or up to nurse.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	just use the jonnies at the hospital there ideal for breast feeding and then just use a night gown with slippers when you go home and slip your arm out the top thats what i did.
fHjSonssaa	I started to lose my plug a day or 2 shy of 33 weeks- and with it came the pressure.  There wasn't a lot of blood- if you looked REALLY closely, it was pink-tinged.  I would go to birth center/hospital even if your DR/mid-wife doesn't seem concerned.  They didn't seem concerned with me over the phone, but when I finally just went in- they ended up admitting me.  My son was born 26 hours later- 33 weeks to the day.    Because you are already on bedrest for pre-term labor, I would consider you to be high risk- so I don't why they don't seem more concerned-     and with the increased pressure...I had NO contractions with my son,  Not when I was dilating, not when I pushed- I just didn't have any.  And there was the pressure- and there his head was.  Go.  Now.  You're too early along to not be going!!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, it's not really a plug in the sense that it plugs things up, it's a barrier of mucus which can be reformed an infinity number of times during a pregnancy, loosing it often indicated cervical thinning but not always.   You will make more mucus, and don't worry until you see bloody show or you're having contractions.
d2fcf78a4441e801854c7b22e08d60b8aa	It is possible. Withdrawal is not a particularly effective method of birth control, small amounts of sperm can be released before ejaculation and ejaculation within the vicinity may still result in pregnancy.    If you want to be sure in early pregnancy the best bet is to see a GP and get a blood test. The pregnancy tests you buy in stores may take a little longer to pick up an early pregnancy.    If you don't want to get pregnant I would suggest using a barrier method of birth control or getting back on the pill.|`|p0prrzf2aa	so take a test|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think go in and take a test.|`|bzST3EcWaa	hi, i am currently in your same position. except for i was not using birth control. i am fifteen years old and just found out three days ago i am pregnant. so my advice to you is to take a pregnancy test asap and if it is positive think very carefully about your opinions and if its negative you should definitely get back on your birth control pregnancy is not something that should be taken light of. i am scared to death but i messed up and im willing to deal with it.|`|OMDLu028aa	Even if you were using birth control, condoms AND pulled out, you could be pregnant. I know a couple who used condoms and the pill and still got pregnant.    The pull-out method is not reliable in the slightest. Pre-*** comes out before ejaculation and does contain a little sperm. To be honest, there's a decent chance you are pregnant. If it's just a scare, please be more careful next time!!    If you think you're mature enough to be having sex, you should be mature enough to be EXTREMELY careful!!
H2IhRXIIaa	Same here! Except I havent got anything done with the babys room yet. But I was going to do dark beige walls. And maybe some deep wine red trim around the top and bottom. As for little designs..or theme..I was thinking like a mellow jungle..or winne the pooh. But keep the both classic..|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Sea life.  Wildlife of any sort.  Zoos, etc...  Ducks..  Even angels.  Just brightly colored toys of all sorts.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I would do the beige with maybe a yellow and green and do a garden or jungle theme. I am using these decals in my baby's room and they are so adorable and also neutral. :]    http://whatisblik.com/weegallery.html|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	I think an aqua blue would be equally nice for a girl or boy. You could do an ocean/ sea animals theme. Cute!|`|78FXygtoaa	uhm certain light shades of yellow would look nice. or maybe a shade of green but im not sure with the beige. orange maybe? no... if anything i would go with the yellow... good luck =]|`|IlSALGKMaa	Sea green is very pretty, Easter colourish.    http://tightjacket.com/images/gallery/71...    Maybe Teal?    http://www.marathononline.com/images/tea...    Maybe a light red?    http://joangevaert.nl/shop/images/0108_1...    Or Dark Red/Maroon?    http://www.hercules-online.com/catalog/p...    Just throwing some ideas around. :)|`|zj2pExMraa	you should paint the room the colours of your husbands fave sports team lol  many dads dnt feel like there involved enuff with there kids so would b a gr8 way t show he is lol  only a suggestion :)|`|gHRbi3c5aa	The colour you choose has as much to do with the size of the room and how much light comes into it as it has to do with the gender of your baby.      Some colours, like aqua can make a room look small and dark. Blue can make a room look cold, green can look perfect for an old person, yellow can look yukky and beige, well beige IS yukky. BUT Dulux  makes a colour called Daffodil White . . .  it's a beautiful and very very soft yellow which makes a dark room look cheerful and is clean and is good for boy or girl AND you can, when you know what gender your baby is, add pink or blue or green or whatever with curtains, quilt covers, blankets, rugs and stuff.    Ivory is beautiful too. Again you can add colour to it when you're ready.    Enjoy!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I did looney toons because that was gender friendly.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	I would do soft yellows or greens with animals or something cute like that. I know I am having a boy, but I still love the pastel yellow and green with the safari animals. The nursery is fun to design, but remember the baby really doesn't care if it's perfect. Just make it nice for you :)
IOU6zo9Raa	My guess would be that you are pregnant. i just answered a question like this and said that the discharge/ wet feeling your describing is what made me take a test the first time I was pregnant. With my current pregnancy, early on  i kept having menstrual like cramps. They really worried me but sre normal during the first few weeks. I had no symptoms before I tested this time, we were trying and I just had a gut feeling. If you feel like there is something different going on than take a test! It's probably a good time since you already missed your period. If it is negative it may be too early and youll want to take another in a few weeks. i buy the cheapies at dollar tree! Good luck!|`|kOz3T3Buaa	try tests, there are ones you can try 5 days earlier your period day.  What about your nipples? Do you feel sore? Because this is the only thing happen to me before I found out I'm pregnant!|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	i had the same issue your body is adjusting to your hormones changing the doctor told me she told me to just wear a pantiliner and its not to early to test your past your due date for your period so test|`|yCR6qg0baa	You're only 2 days late. Since you've been "feeling like it's coming", it's probably just late. No, it's not too soon to test. It's 99% accurate at one day late.|`|MQ34YW28aa	yes the same thing happened to me. I kept on having the period cramps like my period was coming but never showed up. my breasts started to hurt also like they normally do when period comes but got severely sore. I had some whitish discharge really not sure what it was though. and about 2 weeks after i missed my period the pregnancy test finally came out positive. i waited a week after my period to take a test and it came out negative and took a test everyday and finally about 9 days later it came out positive. but every womans HCG levels are different. good luck.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Sometimes your period just becomes irregular i had my period in october and then i missed all of november and had 5 negetive pregnancy tests then on december 6 i started i took another pt after it stopped just be sure and i was not pregnant then when i missed januarys period i didnt really think anything of it cuz i missed november well i started feeling sick and was grumpy and tired and i took a test and sure enough im 8 wks pregnant today so i would just give it some time and then take a test and if you still dont start go see your gyno...Good Luck and baby dust to all|`|IlSALGKMaa	Yep! That happened to me also. I didn't have any money, so I had to wait. It was about 1-2 weeks after I missed my period when I actually got to test and I drank alcohol a week earlier, and I feel so bad about it. :*(|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I felt so normal, not like my period was coming at all. I just had a feeling that I needed to take a pregnancy test, and did the day my period was due.  You should be able to get an accurate result if you tested now, if it's negative just wait a few more days and test again.
RPzHnYFcaa	i too had a really bad cough and it lasted over a month everytime i went to the dr they kept telling me to take robitussun and i finished 2 bottles and nothing. i asked if it was safe to take delsym which is also over the counter and they said yes and that worked for me, so you could try that. the cough never hurt the baby shes still kicking like crazy lol.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	The cough could be due to stress or it could be that your cold hasn't finished with you yet BUT what is not good for the baby is all the stuff you are taking or have taken.    Keep yourself warm, rest as much as you can. Let nature take its course. Relax and baby will be more relaxed. You've lots coming your way and need to take care of yourself.    One thing I do when I get a cough like this is to rub tiger balm on my throat every night - - -  it's all herbs. It will help to soothe your throat and hopefully reduce your cough.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think the baby will be fine. I would go back to your doc and tell them that it is still not better.|`|NroZQN5vaa	As long as you're getting the oxygen you need, baby will be fine. As for treating the cough, try gargling salt water. Put about 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon of salt in water and mix in well. Then just gargle it. It'll taste pretty awful and probably make you thirsty, but that's how I always take care of a cough.|`|d2fcf78a4441e801854c7b22e08d60b8aa	Your cough won't hurt the baby, if you get a fever take a paracetamol if it gets to high make sure you see your GP.     The same thing happened to me when was pregnant. Due to the presence of the baby your immune system is suppressed which means that viruses and normally minor ailments hit you harder. I remember being amazed at how hard a simple cold hit me, and it turned into conjunctivitis which I had never had in my life.    Keep taking your pregnancy vitamins and supplement with vitamin C. Keep your fluids up, hot honey and lemon a very soothing and it was recently shown that it really does alleviate symptoms. The most effective remedy is rest, try and spend an entire day (or even a weekend) in bed to give your poor overloaded immune system a chance to get into gear.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	you having a cough isnt bad for the baby, when i was about 20 weeks i have a chest infection and they just said take parcetomal, it will not effect your baby|`|GNgp759Yaa	ur not suppose to use vapour rub when pregnant so ive been told but i dont use it anyway, coughs normally go away on there own but if u cought wen u breath it sounds more like asthma. u can also take regular paracetamol
0Sv8PiH9aa	Say what??    You will get more answers if you don't post this in pregnancy lol.|`|6qdPyP7eaa	Yippee...2 pts for me!!!
jNgh3e3Faa	I did.  I had symptoms that I did not recognize or want to though.   I had bigger breasts. I ate a bit more.   I slept longer.   I had no period.   I went and got checked out when my mother noticed my big belly. I was five months and one week.   BUT I did not take a test.   Is there another reason you did not have a period? Stress? You should see a doctor for no periods.|`|X6as2nOAaa	You could be some people don't have the symptoms ask a doc.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	If your getting negative tests then I am 99% sure you are not pregnant. Some women have gone full term and not known they were pregnant but it's rare and I doubt they ever tested.    If your having periods, that is a pretty good indication that you aren't pregnant. If your not, you need to go to the doctor to find out why you are skipping so many.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	you could be and if you dont get any symptoms then god bless you, i wish i was that lucky|`|i8Ch743Laa	Talk to a doctor. I didn't show with my daughter until 6 1/2,7 months. You didn't tell us if your tests came out positive or negative,so I'm assuming negative. I would think you'd need to get checked out,as ovarian cysts can cause these same types of issues. I had them.|`|GNgp759Yaa	i had no symptoms what so ever apart from a missed period? and what did the test say??|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	1 in a MILLIONTH chance. Some women have vaginal BLEEDING but not periods. If you're not showing by now and you're having periods, I'd say stop worrying.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	You should be showing around now, but I guess it is possible, it seems like you would of felt your uterus stretching, if you are though, and you haven't gone to the doctor yet, you better hurry because doctors don't accept someone after 5 months, then you've got to have a natural birth at home and just hope that everything is fine.|`|M92DlyzDaa	Ehm no,at about 4 months you will feel the first kick of the baby :)|`|p2l8zQYuaa	You said you took 4 tests, i am assuming it came out negative because your asking if you're pregnant and stuff. If your tests turned out negative i would advise you to ask your doctor and get yourself checked. If your tests turned out positive then you are pregnant, you can still be pregnant and not have any symptoms, every woman is different. Hope this helps.|`|faueyTBvaa	Are you saying you are not having period or you are having them? I wasn't clear on this. I think if you aren't having periods it can be possible you are pregnant. I was watching a show on TLC where a few women didn't even show or have the symptoms of pregnancy and they had babies so I guess its a definite possibility. Some of them even said the tests turned up negative each time. If you haven't had periods you may want to just get a check up at your doctor anyway to make sure nothing is wrong. Hope this helps!|`|EsGrIscFaa	My aunt found out she was pregnant at 5 months. Thought she had an ovarian cyst and went for an ultrasound. And surprise!|`|IQfFvNBZaa	OK So i am going through the exact same thing and ive done research and asked around and from what i gather it is possible..so i dont know but if you find out please let me know...im sorry i couldnt be more help.
eipKsxXpaa	Trust me, it doesn't matter how little you are you're baby still has room to grow. Its very common for women to feel short of breath during the later stages of pregnancy because your baby is taking up more room. A doctor would probably not induce you at this point - 37 weeks is considered full term so I'm sure if you go see your doctor you could schedule one in a few weeks.  Or, as you said you're measuring 37 weeks now so it's possible that he would go ahead and schedule one sooner than that. Just tell him all of your issues and he'll advise you on the best course of action based on what's best for both of you.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Talk to your doctor.  But I doubt they will think about inducing until 37 weeks at the earliest.  You doctor might have some ideas on how to make you more comfortable.     With my first pregnancy I had a blood clot discovered in my leg at 26 weeks.  And even with the clot in my leg (DVT's as large as the one I had generally take months to dissolve) they wouldn't induce me until 38 weeks.  I am a pretty small person as well (5'4, skinny and very small boned) and I just could not gain weight with my 9 months of morning sickness and all the trouble I had with the clot.  My daughter literally ran out of room in stomach.  She was born 18 inches and before her two week appointment she grew 2 inches.    So this is something that you need to discuss with your doctor.  But be prepared for a "no" for a while though. Especially if your health is not at any real risk.  I know being uncomfortable late in pregnancy really is bad especially when you have other  complications. But I think your doctor can help you feel a little better until then.  Good luck and I hope all works out well.  Hang in there.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	most doc wont induce until 39th week unless theres complications and it seems like ure having some , so definatelly call ur doc and see what his/her opinion is on this|`|WGXdfh22aa	i would tell your doctor all of these problems. im sure they would be more likely to induce you this early if it is really a problem which it sounds like it is. good luck!!|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	It is not safer for your baby to be delivered earlier than it wants to be. It takes a full 37 weeks to be sure the lungs are mature, and even after that, the doctors that I work with still do an amniocentesis to make sure the lungs are mature. It sounds like you're letting your emotions get the best of you. I think that you need to find a way to mentally and physically relax. Try yoga. I have had many pregnant patients that were TINY, and they were uncomfortable, but you just have to find a way to deal with it. You need to make the best choices for the baby... not the best choices for your comfort. If you feel like you're going to pass out-- sit down on the ground!!. Women have been having babies since the beginning of time; now, women want doctors to have their babies for them! Just be patient and calm, and take care of your body. You're baby will not run out of room... even if you're tiny, your uterus can accommodate 12lbs at least!   And make a mental note of how your body is handling this pregnancy, and thing long and hard before getting pregnant again!  Stay calm and take care... for your baby's sake.
98WKYtfwaa	I answered your previous question about this too, but i'll give my input on this since there is more detail.    You're 19, an adult. Your mother won't throttle you, she'll probably be disappointed but she'll get over it. Just sit her down and tell her, write her a letter or phone her to tell her.     You are caring far too much into what they'll think and how they'll react, you never know how they're gonna react till you tell them.     Like i said before, you're entitled to all these benefits and you'll get priority for a house. Postpone your uni course and get any job to support you just now, save it all up. I added all the things up today i needed for baby, clothes, pram, crib, feeding stuff, bath stuff etc etc and it's came to a little over 1000, so if you get a job even for a few months then you can make a good bit to start buying things in, then with your grants and benefits you get 11 weeks before your due date you can have money for when your baby comes along.     So in the meantime, you should tell your family about this, try and find the father to tell him and then think about your uni course, i wouldn't worry too much about it. They're going to find out sooner or later.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	you dont have to drop out of school, it will be hard but at least keep going part time, it will benefit you and your baby in the future so much more, especially if you have to go it alone, having a degree will help you find a stable job that can support the two of you.  Ask your parents if they can help you so that you can stay in school , they will probably be more supportive if they dont think you are just oging to move home and throw your future away.  show your mom that you are still serious about making the best of yourself.|`|x3vnPezTaa	I would just tell your mom. She will either accept it or not. If she doesn't accept it oh well. Im sure eventually she will come around.  Right now you need to care about yourself and your baby. I do think that you are caring about what others will think way too much. Besides, you are an adult you can make your own decision's. If i were you i would go walmart or something and get a nook ( pacifier) and tie a tag on it that says your going to be a grandma. Or mail it to her. You are her daughter sooner or later she will accept it if she doesnt right off the bat and she will be there for you. Just make it clear to her that you need her help and support being as the dad is living 5 hours away.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i was 19 and at college when i found out that i was pregnant and i didnt want to tell my mum cuz she always wanted more for me. My bf made me tell my mum but i did do it over the phone cuz i wasnt living at home but my mum didnt react as bad as i thought and all the did was tell me she couldnt talk to me and she put the phone down on me but she rang me back after an hour and now i am 35 weeks and she has help me and my bf get all our sons stuff ready and help me decorate his room cuz she is so excited about her first grandchild but you will find cuz she has already got a grandchild she will be ok with it, but she will be disappointed with you but thats all mums    Good Luck    x|`|EsGrIscFaa	I was 19 and at the end of my 1st year when I found out I was pregnant. Thought my parents would be horrified - I was also the first to go to uni, in loads of debt and only working part-time as a waitress.    This is what I did - told my parents.  They asked what I was going to do and I said I was keeping the baby but apart from that I didn't know yet.     I stayed at uni and went part-time for my 2nd year and completed it over two years only doing two modules each semester. This gave me the time I needed off whilst pregnant and meant I didn't miss too much whilst off having my baby.  But being part-time you will have to pay council tax - speak to your local authority and discuss it with them.    I moved into a rented house with my boyfriend and  we claimed housing benefit. This can be difficult to do as a student as generally local authorities won't give benefits to students but as a low income parent/family they will normally give you something - this will make you exempt from council tax.     Your uni may also provide a 'hardship fund' or something of a similar name that you can apply for - it's non-repayable and can also mean a reduction on your tution fees. Speak to your student rep or go to the releavant department in your uni.    Just remember that your life doesn't have to end as a result of having a baby - it just makes changes.  My boyfriend and I both got a 2:2 in the end and we now have a wonderful photo of us both in our gowns with our daughter, age 2, there to celebrate with us.    And you may be suprised at how supportive friends and family can be when it comes down to it. Good luck x|`|YXWmaOryaa	You poor thing this is so hard, god I was 26 with a good job and low mortgage payments and I still dreaded telling mine, but do it sooner rather than later, my dad lives in france adn my mum down in england and so my dad I sent an email with a scan pic attached adn my mum well I left it and left it and eventually told her two weeks before my due date!! LOL Anyway they were both over the moon when I told them adn I wished I had just told them sooner and not worried so  much about it!! (I feel like the black sheep in my family too as I didn't go to uni and my sister did and now she owns a big farm house and I live in a small city house) but the point is nothing matters when there is a wee baby coming into the world who is gonna be loved adn cared fr, that is the most important thing in the world. And you don't have to drop out of uni, my friend found out she was pregnant whilst at uni and she Just deferred for a year and then went back once she had had the baby, if you live in the UK there are lots of grants and things to help you. good luck xx p.s why did you split up with the babies dad? and if it was coz you were arguing loads could it have been coz of hormones and you didn't know?? Its just my man drove me mental when I was pregnant but looking back now I was being quite i=unreasonable with him coz f my hormones!! XX|`|l6dOPCWoaa	I KNOW your mom will be shocked but you have to tell somebody go to  the doctors on your own or with a friend i sure you can carry on with your studies could you live at home when the babies born good luck.|`|9NC2CHQkaa	I'm 21, Droped out of college and was planing to go back till i found out I was prego. I'm the second youngers in my family and the first to get prego. Kinda sad.    When I told my mom I was like dont yell at me and dont hit me when I come home and just let it out. Yes she was upset with me but that didn't last long at all now she is so excited that I'm having a baby.    Its kinda crazy cuz I alwasy thought should would be mad.    When we told my boyfriends parents we thought that was goin to be the hardest thing to do, hes the youngest in his family and this will be their second grandchild. They werent mad at all, they are excited to have another grandchild.    When I told my dad whom I havn't talked to in 6 years. he was confused about it all at first, so me and my boyfriend went and had tea with him and him and his wife are super excited now they have went out and bought stuff for the baby, And  I was about 8 weeks then.     I'm now 13 weeks and every one is amazing about it.    No one will be mad about it.     You just have to get your debt undercontrol now so you wont have to worrie so much wwhen the baby comes. me and my boy really cant afford to have a baby right now seeing as i have debt and so does he, he doesnt have a job at the moment and I do but I dont make enough to support the 3 of us.     Trust me every thing will be fine.  Good luck   And tell the father of your baby ASAP you will need the support .|`|ooadGX6Laa	Hi,  I was worried about this too, I was 19 when I fell pregnant, and although I had been with my partner for 2 years and we had our own house, I was still very young.  My partner is 26 so he is at a much better age.  I was really worried about telling my family as they are very much set in their 'old fashioned' ways of build up a career, get a house, get married, then have children when your 30ish.  So telling them my news was SO scary, but at the end of the day, as harsh as it sounds, I thought stuff it, this is my baby, both me and my partner wanted the baby, so it was up to them to either support me or not.    As harsh as this sounds, its your life, and although none of us like 'disapointing' our parents, life doesnt always go as planned, and once the baby is born, there is no way they would swap it.     In the end, my parents got used to the idea, and my mum is sooooooo excited, she couldnt be more supportive.     So hang on in there, tell her when it feels right, but you have to prepared for them to be shocked, but after the idea has settled in, they will be so excited, I am sure.  And its not like you are 12 years old and pregnant, end of day, your an adult.    Good luck, really hope things work out well and that you have a very happy pregnancy. xxx|`|faKgix2Qaa	i wouldn't tell her|`|xHO40Uwvaa	just call her and say "hello grandma" and then go from there  that is how i told my dad...well, i said "hello Grandpa"...but it's not the end of the world...life goes on|`|GoCcTiyDaa	Tell her as soon as you can (face to face) - it'll be the best for all of you. Then you can move on and plan what you want to do - delaying just makes it worse - and will lessen some of your choices.|`|AA11609331	Two of my daughters turned up pregnant but they were a couple of years younger than you are. At 19 you are a legal adult and while you do not wish to get at odds with your family you have to tell them of your problem. I know that while they may indicate  their displeasure with you I am willing to bet that they will come around and be supportive of you in the end. In my experience it was not a good thing for my daughters to marry the guy's that were the fathers of their children as in the long run it all ended in divorce. One of them eventually found the right one and the other never did. If you are not solidly in love with the father of your child you might avoid a great deal of heartache if you decide not to marry. That of course is your choice. Both of my girls are in their 50's now and it worked out for one and not the other. I hope you have the good fortune to find a winner. It sounds like you have the possibility to finish at University and I hope you do. It is one of the best things to get a proper education as it opens up all kinds of possibilities for you    Good luck and do not get discouraged.|`|91af23d831c0d95018ef72f29e306053aa	sweetheart dont worry:-) the answer will come you but if this helps heres a quick bit abt my life .. i TOO was at uni and doing well on my course i TOO fell pregnant i spoke to my fav tutor he arranged for me to continue my studies even tho i had drs etc (i had to do catch up and it took me an extra couple of yrs) i dont know how your babys dad wll take it but mine was ok ..we didnt get married but we stayed friends and last yr my baby!! turned 21 and we all (my hubby n i his dad n step mum) but most important my baby had a great night while he told us he was engaged (double celebration) and i got my degree too .. im not gonna lie its bloomin hard but it can be done and the rewards are brill. i really wish you BOTH the best of life happiness luck n love x|`|gHRbi3c5aa	There's only one way to tell her . . . .  that is just to tell her BUT give her time to be shocked, mad and all that. don't argue with her if she gets mad and starts to shout, just wait till she's calmed down and then you can talk about it and about what to do.    You also need to tell the dad. he needs to know.    Nothing else matters. Don't decide what they're gonna say or do before you tell them and even if you're right, they still have a right to know and you have a right to ask for their support and baby has a right to have everyone involved.    It's not going to be easy. My heart goes out to you but just remember that every challenge you meet face on will help you become a good mum.    Take care. Be open. Let others choose how to behave but give them time to get used to the idea.    Most of all be kind to yourself and your baby.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Well that is very noble. Im 20 and Ive just started Uni and Im finding it boring and I thought to myself well at least the girls that are pregnant and/or married have something to look forward to, and I stand by that you do. Im so bored right now. But anyway I recognise a bit of similarity because I wont leave Uni mainly because of what people will think, people dont have respect for my family and my family doesn't really believe in me even though I am the first person to go to University.     I can completely understand why you feel a bit of bother because you have a secret but as soon as you tell people start focusing on you and the baby. Ive heard that some people send letters or cards this may work, a phone call is still very awkward. Don't worry about things its not worth it, the baby you have might be the next Justin Timberlake or Tony Blair. just make this promise to yourself that you'll do everything possible to make the child's upbringing a success, because anything less then that is not worth the 9 months.|`|tsoc9tihaa	if you want this baby  and your going to care and love for it and give it everything it needs in life  theres your answer.  if that is what YOU want  its your decision  not your mums  be strong  and tell her what YOU want|`|OQsj0Am3aa	Ok so obviously not telling her isn't an option.    You seem pretty certain you want to keep the baby.  Just phone and tell her.  She might not be happy as first but once the baby is born she'll be over the moon.|`|qq159sWMaa	I've been in this situation before, I know just how hard it is.  Try sitting down and telling your mother that you love her and then just tell her.  Remember a Mother's love for their child is unlike that of any other and just because you are pregnant now and having a baby doesn't mean you can't go back to University.  Once you tell your mother you'll feel better and you'll have a support system there for you along the way.  You care enough to post your problem here I have no doubt you will be a good mother.  Good luck!
x4uGfC4oaa	Yes. Take a pregnancy test.|`|X6as2nOAaa	yes you could|`|o8xNTVWTaa	if it was unprotected then ya u really should be going and taking a hpt  sex+missed period=baby|`|p2l8zQYuaa	There's a possiblity you might be, who knows, just take a pregnancy test|`|oT2rYpg7aa	duh girl..of course you can be. i have heard cases even while your in your cycle.     you should be more specific though. but you should go to your gyn...|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	you might be cause you haven't see your period yet.
af79b286b208d9345788435fdeb00b17aa	Test in 4 days and again in 6 you should know by then, take things easy don't lift thing that are heavy just encase you are sounds good tho x x
AA11234404	That's normal. Your uterus is growing and causing the cramps. Congrats|`|DrFJfnpBaa	No need to worry, it's totally normal. I have them all the time, but now I've learned to ignore them. It happens with a lot of woman. Im not exactly sure what causes them, but I am sure your perfectly fine :D.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	I had those too(I'm 20wks) they just went away, and my doctor said that everything is fine. Mention it to your doctor anyway just in case. Good luck and congrats.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	The only answer is you're bleeding, no one could say for sure why. Look within yourself and examine how your body and emotions feel, do you feel like you're having your period or does it feel different to you. Keep in mind even if it feels different it could just be the hormones in the pill throwing you off. It's up to you to decide what's going on really. All you can do is calm down, take a deep breath and realize this too shall pass.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Plan B maybe even just threw it off. That's possible. I wouldn't freak out about a miscarriage,you've got no reason to think that. It seems morel ike Plan B threw off your cycle. I wouldn't use Plan B all the time though.|`|3WFac9xaaa	Plan B doesnt terminate a pregnancy if already pregnant.  Is it your period? lol.  It could maybe i guess be a miscarriage
44OH7Si6aa	If your amniotic fluid is too low, the doctor will more than likely induce labor early|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I don't understand.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Ummm, say that again?
0Sv8PiH9aa	I don't think questions like this are funny at all. Any 54 year old would know better.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Why would you want to have a baby at 54 years old? You would be 72 by the time the child graduated from HIGH SCHOOL.|`|X6as2nOAaa	no that was a dumb question if you really are 54 why don't you adopt  and that is way to old to have a baby anyways.|`|WGXdfh22aa	if you have gone through menopause most likely no|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	its possible in my state there was a 70 year old who just had a baby|`|AA10500537	yes  be very careful  there are change of life babies ,|`|p2l8zQYuaa	That could be risky. Try asking your doctor.|`|BsfR6n6taa	umm no if you dont have your period you cant have a baby unless you have some kind of surgery or implants done. But if you dont have your period you dont need to have a baby. You dont need to have a baby at 54 anyways....
QH5oOFutaa	I had the same thing with my pregnancies. Your towards the end of your pregnancy and your baby is getting ready to come out. So your son is probably way down there, causing more blood to circulate down there. You ever notice if you bump a part of your body or get a cut and you feel it pulsating...its kind of the same thing. We have actually had women come into our L&D department saying their baby was coming out. But no, its just the extra blood flow. congrats and best of luck :)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Could be hiccups.  My son had hiccups nearly every day in utero.  That's actually how I knew he wasn't breech before they told me.    I could tell they were hiccups when I first felt them, it's a pretty distinctive pattern.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	yep! thats your baby hiccuping! Neat huh? :) Nothing to worry about.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	Sounds like hiccups to me. It's really cool.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	My baby had his first set of hiccups this morning. It felt like when you hiccup yourself, constant, every few seconds, a big jump like a extremely powerful kick, and since he didn't know what was going on, he was moving a lot between them, and really wiggling. Did it it feel like that? Your baby is probably just exploring different places.|`|MQ34YW28aa	lol. yes it's the baby hiccuping and it's a crazy feeling. i always told my husband that my pelvic was hiccuping. joke between us. how often do you get to say that?? lol. it's a different feeling that's for sure. and it's nothing to worry about and he is head down so that's great. congrats!!|`|CihXOM2caa	Could be hiccups, or your baby keeping a beat. Try seeing if the pulses match your heartbeat.|`|pVEuJiLkaa	I'm due the 21st!  I actually felt the pulsating feeling against my lower abdomen last night while I was trying to fall asleep... It lasted for a few minutes straight.  Either hiccups or possibly lots of crazy energy w kicks?  My little girl was head down at the last ultrasound as well, but I have heard they do turn quite a bit, so who knows where your baby is now?  Possible kicking at the lower area?
QH5oOFutaa	Her cervix is more than likely opening. Your baby cant come out unless the cerviz is opened. I think what the Dr meant was she could have a miscarriage if she doesnt stay on bedrest. And get the guy arrested. Im sry she has to be going through this. Good luck to both of you :)|`|SRzswqTeaa	Most women don't even know they are pregnant at 3 weeks.  But let's give her the benefit of the doubt, she might have had some blood work done.  BUT that early, they wouldn't be able to see much of anything on an ultrasound.  They can only speculate at this point.  The second point I'd like to make is that the baby cannot become completely detached.. it would die.  The only thing I can think of is that they said the placenta is partially detached and that she would require bedrest to keep from losing the baby (miscarriage).. or as you or someone else put it "Fall out" (which isn't as literal as you would think, especially considering the baby is practically invisible to the naked eye at this point).  I'm laughing out loud about the part about it needing to keep moving further up inside back into the usual place.  NOT gonna happen!  lol  If it's detached, it's over.  I really think somebody is either trying to pull one over, or is seriously confused about what is happening in their body.  Good luck :-)|`|SwKPJRNvaa	A woman in India's baby fell out while she was on the toilet. It fell through the **** chute, onto the tracks in the Rajasthan heat and survived!    Apparently it can happen -google the story and it should appear|`|13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	If the baby was detached from her it would be dead as it gets it's oxygen supply from her, I don't have a clue what she's talking about.|`|IlSALGKMaa	I'm assuming it could happen when it's that small, but I have no idea. If it's what the doctor said, I would believe it.|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	This is not possible.    The baby has either become detached from the womb, which, at 3 weeks pregnant she wouldn't even know she was pregnant. Nor would a push be strong enough to miscarry.    Her cervix could be opening which means she will inevitably miscarry (sad I know)|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	If the embryo became detached, it would be dead therefore she'd be miscarrying. But that aside, at only 3 weeks pregnant, It's not possible to even tell your pregnant, because the embryo hasn't implanted in the uterus yet.. So lying down wouldn't "move the embryo further up into her" because it would be futile.  I think what the doctor probably meant, is that the cervix has been weakened by the fall, and undue pressure could cause it to open and bring on miscarriage.. And if she really is only 3 weeks, which is unlikely, it wouldn't be anything more than a heavy period, as its still a ball of cells at that stage..|`|CihXOM2caa	I've never heard anything like that before... weird|`|RDZzKsflaa	I highly doubt that a baby can just fall out. A woman's cervix has to widen by like, 10cm for the baby to be pushed out, so unless hers is like that all the time, then it won't just fall out.    Just make sure she keeps her legs together until she's ready, he he!|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Ummmm i never herd that before but she would only bleed and loose the baby thats about it...........|`|98WKYtfwaa	If the baby was detached from her it would be dead, therefore she'd be miscarrying.     I think he meant that her cervix is opening or opened slightly and the baby can die and come out (miscarry) if she doesn't bedrest, when they say bedrest they mean staying in bed 24/7 and only get out it for the loo and to eat.    She needs to follow these instructions if she wants her baby to have a chance of survival.|`|FjqBPprDaa	The only reason that's possible is because the baby will be small than your thumb if she is 3 weeks pregnant. But even so, how can a push detach a baby from an umbilical cord, and it will still have the placenta and everything around it so it cant fall out.  Very unlikely.   Frankiee x|`|JDw1RDcaaa	no its not but it could be the case that the placenta has become away a bit but if she is only three weeks she should of lost the child. I dont know you or your "friend" but i would say she is lieing.|`|EsGrIscFaa	It does sound odd but maybe she's talking about implantation. The egg implants in the lining of the womb and I suppose if it was detatched then she is at risk of miscarrying. She should just follow the doctors advice.|`|YPrgk9Ygaa	I have never hurd anything like that b4. Check with some other drs. and ask them. Try online and check places like medmd.|`|NGhYFQnDaa	I've never heard that, like others have said it could be that the cervix is opening and could lead to miscarriage    And to the person that said you wouldnt know if you were pregnant at 3 weeks.    I am 4 weeks pregnant and found out at 3+5|`|e8W9Q9cbaa	In the very early stages of pregnancy, before the placenta has been made, the embryo attatches itself onto the side of the womb. There is no umbilical cord or placenta at this stage. This is why you often get mild cramping, or implantation pains in the begining of pregnancy.     So yes, I guess it is possible.     One thing that strikes me as strange though, pregnancy is dated from the first the day of your last period, so if you found out you were pregnant on the day your period was due, then you would be classed as 4 weeks pregnant already. So I dont know how she is 3 weeks pregnant, unless she has tested really early.
yCR6qg0baa	You had a regular period (even if yours are usually longer or heavier). It can be lighter or heavier month-to-month. And all of those "common pregnancy symptoms" are also typical PMS symptoms.     If you're on your period, you're not pregnant. I know people tend to say, "anything can happen", but having a period while pregnant is NOT good. It's also rare-- like 1 in 200,000. Some women get "implantation bleeding" (also rare) a few days before their period is due & mistake it for a period. It's usually a teeny, tiny bit of brown or pink spotting, but NO blood.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	You need to see your GP and have a test. You might be pregnant (even though you are bleeding again). You might have been pregnant or, well, seeing a GP will help set your mind at rest.    Good luck.|`|1ScoQM0faa	hi,it took me and my partner 25 months of contraception free sex to conceive our daughter.  It takes up to a year for your body to go back to 'normal' after stopping the pill.  just be patient,it will happen when your bodies ready,and remember that your egg is only alive for 12 hours after the ovaries releases it, but sperm can live up2 72hours.so count the 14 days from the start of your period, and have sex every-other day(yeah i know, sometimes hard, and tiring) to be sure .  good luck x|`|eryJKCpfaa	it may take time for your body to adjust not being on the pill. It can take up to 6mo for your body to regulate it self again.. Just because your period only lasts 2-3 days, does not mean its irregular. That might be whats normal for you. Mine were only 3-4 days long. Just keep track of when your period starts and stops for the next few months.. you will typically ovulate 14 days after your period began.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	I was three months pregnant and still having my period before any pregnancy test from the shop or doctors came up positive so if your test comes up neg and you think you are then keep taking tests because you know your body better than everyone else.
0Sv8PiH9aa	I'm almost as advanced as you as far as effacing and I lost my mucus plug last night, even though it could still be 2 weeks I am experiencing nausea too. I threw up in my boyfriends car out of nowhere yesterday lol.. I thought I was done with it!     I also too have a lot of pressure its almost unbearable sometimes. But just relax and take it easy. It all sounds normal to me :)|`|gHRbi3c5aa	Nausea isn't usually anything to worry about but your head not feeling right might be. You could just be coming down with flu but it's a good idea to speak to your GP.    Having said that I was nauseous through every single day of my pregnancy right to the very end.|`|AA11063878	okay..so I've been through labor twice..just be alert...each and everytime I knew the baby was coming...because I threw up right before they popped out..I'd call for the doctor...right away.
AOvtRBU9aa	I used to think it was gross to breast feed but once I had my baby everything was different. It was just a natural to do it. I didn't decide either way when I was pregnant. I thought we would just go with the flow of things. It just turned out that I really wanted to do it. I was so in love with my baby that I couldn't find myself to not at least TRY to give her the best. After giving birth, if your still weary about it, just pump and give it in a bottle. Or you can just go directly to formula. Yes breast is best but it has to be best for both mother and baby though so do what you're comfortable with.|`|d1HO25Qaaa	You might find this feeling disappears when your little one arrives. I'm 23 and my daughter is 10 weeks old. When she arrived my reservations about breastfeeding disappeared, and even though it was a bit of a struggle for the first week, its well worth it. It feels totally normal now and I don't even think about it.|`|ob7jTC5Caa	What everyone is saying is true.  When you see your baby for the first time, breast feeding comes naturally to you.  It's what the baby knows to do and what you're instincts tell you to do.  Read more information, try going to some classes or finding a support group online to talk with.  All this might help you and ease your fears and make you feel less stressed out.  Some people have a difficult time nursing at first, and some have it easy.  I will say though that breast feeding my son was the most relaxing thing for me.  I would sit in the rocker and close my eyes and have those 15-30 minutes of peace and quiet and relaxation while he nursed and fell asleep.    You should try it in the hospital and if you still feel uncomfortable then go with formula.  You won't know exactly how you feel until you try it out!  Good Luck!|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	What everyone else is saying is true, once you see your baby you wont think its gross you will be overcome. BUT you also dont have to feel bad if you opt to formula feed as many moms do. Many many babies are formula fed and doing just fine. I am breastfeeding my 6 month old and it did come naturally and I wouldnt trade it. But remember that breastfeeding gives your baby antibodies that cant be reciprocated in formula. Even if you only breastfeed for a short time it helps your baby. But again, there are millions of babies who are formula fed and perfectly healthy. It is your choice and you need to remember that and not feel bad whatever way you choose.  Another thing to consider is that the lactation specialists at the hospital can help you get comfortable with the breastfeeding. They helped me a great deal and my son was premature.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	I breastfed both of my children.  It worked out beautifully for me.    I figured I'd try it with my first and found that it was simple and easy.     I found support from Le Leche League, first in a book, then in meetings.  I'm sure they have a web-site now.      Breastfeeding is excellent for the baby, and for you. I encourage you to give it a try.   But, if you decide to bottle feed, don't feel bad.  Today's formulas are very good.  Do what is right for your child, your family.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I would try desensitizing myself to the sight of it to try and make yourself more comfortable with it. Try watching some videos on youtube.com, also try smiling even if you are uncomfortable, it can make the situation more bearable like psyching yourself out. Another fact about breastfeeding that isn't very spoken about, is that when your male partner sees you breastfeeding it actually releasing more oxytocin in his body stimulating a more bonded response from him towards you and the child. Also these hormone changes can keep his sex drive in check while you heal so he won't be hounding you.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	You dont understand, the minute you see your baby and see his little mouth open and try to find some kind of food you wont hate it anymore. IT is so sweet and natural you will love it. Good luck.|`|JU3TLLYjaa	Stay open minded. I was the same but when you get there they l ask. the worst case senario is you try to breastfeed and don't like it...if your in hospitol and decide you don't want to anymore they will give you formula! Just in case remember to sign up at all the baby websites. Huggies/pampers/gerber/nestle/similac/en... they send coupons and samples and you can always trade or give away what you don't need.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	You have not been exposed to breast feeding so you find it weird. It's ok. just remember the only reason you have breast is to feed your baby. It is very natural and beautiful. I never felt weird about it I knew I was breast fed so was my brother. To me it is just what you do.     once you have your baby and give it a try you might think differently.  But it does hurt at first.  Now that I breast feed I feel weird letting my husband near my breast.  I feel like they are for my baby only.     try and expose yourself to breast feeding more. take a class go to a meeting.  if you can do it breast feeding is great you really do build a deep bound with your baby.  honestly once you do it it will feel right and not weird at all.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Here's what I feel about breast feeding & I hope it helps you to make a right decision for you & your baby. It's your choice so don't feel pressured about breastfeeding. It's really good to breastfeed but if you can't, it's okay.     Sometimes, you may not be able to breastfeeding because some people just don't have milk coming out or it's too hurting. Many of my friends could not breastfeed even though they wanted to because of many reasons.     When I thought of breastfeeding I was kind of worried - I was being shy. It was before baby was born and once your baby's out, so many things & your thoughts will change. You'll be surprised at yourself looking back later on.     Of course breastfeeding is good for your baby. What I love about it is it's so easy. You don't have to buy formula, mix it with water, wash the bottle or warm the bottle. When baby's hungry, you just bring him/her to you & feed. When you go out, you don't need to pack bottles or formula.       Another good thing about breastfeeding is that baby does not get sick easily. Your baby will be so strong & healthy. I even used to drop milk into my baby's eyes when she had little trouble - it's like a natural antibiotic! You'll save a lot of money if you breastfeed.      Downside about breastfeeding is that if you don't introduce your baby the bottle soon enough, your baby won't ever take bottle(even though you pumped your milk in it). My baby does not take bottle, I tried from 3 month but it was too late for her. So she needs me all the time because I can only feed her.     Another downside is you need to care about what you are eating & drinking. If you love coffee like me, it won't be so easy. I drink decaf. And little bit of beer & wine are ok once in a while but better not drink too much.     If you are working & if you need to leave her, I've seen many moms giving up breastfeeding because pumping is not that easy.     You are 6 month pregnant & you have plenty of time to think about. Don't worry. I think you'll find the best way for you & your baby.  Take some classes from your birthing center.
2osuEr0naa	You have nothing to worry about. She's most likely not going to get pregnant. Just make sure you use protection, or have her get on the pill to be safe. As long as you didn't put the glob of your sperm into her..then she's fine.   Good luck!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	If there was NO sex. Then chances are slim to none.|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	its possible  ppl are going to tell you its not very likely (which it isnt) but theres still a small chance so if she is it wouldnt matter how likely it is|`|78FXygtoaa	i HIGHLY doubt it. sperm usually dies once air hits it
a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	OK, lots of questions.    You can't take water through security. But you can buy some (overpriced) once past security. Or you can get water on the plane (free). They serve bottled water on planes. You can ask for a bottle. So this is no problem. It's only 45 minutes. I wouldn't even bother making up the formula. In close quarters, it's too hard to do that stuff. You're going to barely miss a feeding if at all in 45 minutes. Just give the baby water in the bottle for take off and landing.    No, your 4 month old baby won't need ID for a domestic flight. But if you are expecting the baby to travel for free, you need to bring the birth certificate to prove that you are under the age restrictions. You never know if you will be the one to be hassled over the free flight, Most airlines allow under 18 months to fly for free. It's hard to mistake a 4 month old for an 18 month old, but you never know when it will happen to you. And the burden of proof is on you to prove that you are following the rules for the free flight.    You can take your car seat onboard if your baby has a paid ticket. And this is the best way to go. This is the safest and most comfportable way to fly, fo everyone - you, the baby, and all of the other passengers.  If you are expecting a free flight, don't take the car seat.    You can not take a stroller on board. If you want to use the stroller while in the airport, you can do so. Take it to the gate with you, get a checkin tag at the gate. Then you leave it at the door of the plane when you board. They will put it in with the luggage for you. They will take it back out and put it back at the door to the plane for you to pick up when you land. This is called gate checking.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You can bring formula on a plane.  Here is the TSA's webpage on the subject:  http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/c...    Does your baby have his own seat on the plane?  If he does, he needs a car seat.  If he doesn't, I would check it and the stroller.    I don't know about ID.  I am pretty sure they don't need it to travel domestically, but I'd bring his birth certificate anyway.|`|bgNB9RzNaa	ive never had a problem taking a water bottle just put it in your carry on bag i dont know about the other 2|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I traveled by airplane with a 3 month old. I just bought a bottle of water from one of the places after security and used that, it won't harm your LO at all. I got those travel sized formula packets ( the tube like kind) and put thosei n my bag no problem. But you can put 3 oz of formula in a baggie , I had a open container of baby juice in my bag, they didn't say anything, but I also told them before hand...I think as long as you tell them and show them they will be ok with it and besides you have the baby with you. You will "maybe" need their Birth Certificate, I was told to bring it, but they see that the baby is under 2 and don't ask. You can ask for a gate claim check( no extra charge), you can take the stroller all the way up to the gate and they put it under the plane for you and have it ready for you when you land. You can either check the car seat, or purchase a ticket for it. If you are flying Southwest, if its not a full flight , they will let you bring the seat on the plane no extra charge. Just make sure to have the baby sucking on something while take off and landing is happening for his lil ears. Have a safe and fun easy flight...you may get lucky and have him sleeping the whole time . :D|`|yGPRntXFaa	Flights understand that you need stuff for your baby.. they may test the water before or after it gets on the plane but they do let you carry formula with you...also the car seat. the stroller you may bring it on board and have the flight attendant help you with it, they will put it away for you.....    Now the air industry caters to women and people with little kids...they let you in the plane first as well....................... just like first class... best of luck....     Also since its only  45 minute flight, carry enough formula... for a couple of feedings, instead of any delays...   oh i just remembered, if you have need warm water, the flight attendants will get it for you.... they boil water to make tea..    Have a nice flight and feel like a great mom who bothers to ask first.....  best of luck to you and be safe................  kids normally love it when the plane goes up and expect the baby to go to sleep............as soon as the plane takes off....
ziCuHSy1aa	Not video games. Just boobs.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	I'm a 13 year old girl, and yeah in my school it seems to be mostly looks. But not just boobs (even though guys stare a lot, and i'm a 34A. lol, nothing there to stare at!) Guys also care about popularity, butts, stomachs, hair, and who their friends are. :P I only know a handful of guys that like girls for who they are.     I have changed myself a bit to get a guy, but its not like I was unhappy about it. All I did was try to make myself look better. I didn't pretend to be someone I'm not (Like I didn't pretend to like soccer or video games, cause I don't.). When I have a major crush, I might wear a bit more natural looking make up or straighten my hair more often, but I am happy with the way i look, even though most of my crushes are long gone.     I haven't actually gone out with a guy, so no one has gone out with me just for my boobs, but I've heard guys say some pretty gross things about girls' butts, or legs, or boobs. It really makes girls like guys less. Its as bad as the "That's what she said" jokes. Its sick and perverted and I would never go out with a guy that even mentioned my boobs.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	They say that because boobs DO win over 12-14 year old boys affections BAHAHAHAHA    EDIT: get a sense of humor kid and stop trying to advertise how "pure" you are|`|IQfaj1BGaa	i'm a girl and i'm 14  no i never went out with a guy because he liked my 'appearance'  nor did i ever change myself for a guy  of the people i've been out with liked me for me  they loves my personality and said my appearance was a bonus to go along with my inner self|`|QP8LdPLeaa	boys your age and up don't really care about a girl's personality, but what she can offer from inside her pants. that's why people say these things. how many times have we all come on here, seen and heard stories of girls saying "my boyfriend wants to have sex, should i do it?" or "my boyfriend just wants to make out every time i come over." so yea..... but kudos if you don't think like that.|`|y3u5WYDMaa	i turned 14 exactly a week ago    finally a guy sees it tht way    i think its unfair for a guy to judge us tht way we dont judge u by ur dicks so why do most guys judge us that wayim happy a guy understands our veiw|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	I'm a girl and a tomboy.

And good for you.|`|AA10953999	I never heard that but it may be do to the fact that around that age both sexes are going through puberty and for young boys, boobs and the female body become a fascination of sorts, that's how me and my friends felt when we were that age.    As an adult you realize there is more to someone than just their physical appearance, that doesn't stop you from appreciating a women body. You sound mature for your age, that's a good thing. The older guys that choose a woman by the size of her breasts are immature.|`|k6XRVeJxaa	I'm sorry. But I honestly don't think I could date you. You have boobs.

Would you date a girl with a penis?    EDIT:    Also, they say that because well, a great deal of boys 12 -14 years old get their affections won over with boobs. It's the sad truth.

Ah6FJHkWaa	You can only work within the perameters of what you are given.    My three children have one sister but unfortunatley they are unable to see her at this time, due to the people she is living with.  We write letters and hopefully her situation will change soon.    The mom will not be in open adoption, because although I 100% support it I know it is not best at THIS time because First mom is quite unhealthy and still in her addiction etc.    We do keep scrapbooks for her and keep an open line with the kids, but sometimes open adoption cannot look like what you want it because of external situation.    What is that old prayer?    God (or deity of your choice) grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;    The courage to change the things I can;    And the WISDOM to know the different.    i am still working on the widsom part.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Regardless of what you guys may want it still takes more then one side to make an open adoption and in my opinion sometimes it's just not possible.  I do believe that in certain situations they can do more harm then good so I'd suggest you give it some sober second thought and do what you feel is possible and what is best for your child.  You can't force things to work the way you wish they would.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	I don't know what to tell you about his father. Unless his name is on the child's original birth certificate, there's nothing you can do if his birth mother won't tell you the father's name, and in the end she is the one who will have to answer to your son when he grows up and wants to meet his birth father, so don't be too hard on yourself. As for the siblings, my suggestion would be to contact either by phone or by mail the parents of the other children letting them know that their child has another sibling who is interested in meeting them if they want. Stipulate that they do not need to know he is their brother if the parents do not want the child(ren) knowing they are adopted, but your son would love to meet them. You could even offer to hire the 14 year old as a baby sitter (thus establishing a relationship between the two without the child finding out). If they are not interested, well, at least you tried. In that case, my advice would be to just ensure they know where you are if they change their minds (i.e., if you move, send them your new address; unless of course they threaten a lawsuit, in which case, drop it). Good luck!|`|b26Dp8LKaa	Wow, what a mess adults create for children sometimes!  Not you, but the bio parents.  Geez!      I was a foster adoptee. I went into my foster home @ 18 months & was adopted at 3 y/o. Growing up in the era of closed adoption, there was never a thought of knowing my siblings. In fact, when I searched for my 1st mom, it didn't occur to me I'd find siblings. I grew up with 3 older siblings in my adopted family.  Turned out I had older & younger siblings in my 1st mom's family & younger siblings on my bio dad's side.    While I admire your desire to want your child to know his siblings, honestly, under the circumstances, I'm not sure the benefits outweigh the confusion & drama it will all bring into this child's life. Or that he'll be able to have meaningful relationships with any of his siblings. Besides, with the age differences, even if the kids were growing up in the same house, it's not likely they'd have a close relationship.     Just keeping the information and making it available to your son one day - if & when he's ready and/or interested - would be great. In the meantime, if you can have a relationship that isn't so complicated with one or two siblings, great. If not, just love your son & let him be a happy boy in your family!    Ditto to what Randy said. Sometimes no matter how hard you want something, you can't make it happen.|`|XW2Bvwfcaa	I am 100% for open adoption.  My husband and I are getting certified to adopt an older child/teen.  We have a baby together, and I have a 6-year old from my first marriage of 8 years.  I compare my daughter's visits with her father to open adoption, especially since the ex has become quite unstable, and it would be tempting to not visit since he has become disinterested and we separated when she was a baby...  I insist on At Least yearly visits, just so my daughter can know that her father loves her.    In this situation, I admit, I think you are fortunate that your little one is too little to be aware of any of this.  I would say that if noone seems very interested in establishing a relationship right now, then if you end up adopting, without adding Too much emphasis, you tell your child he/she is adopted.  As he/ she gets older, he/ she will be more aware of what that means.  When he/she asks questions, you answer.  I wouldn't give too much information while he/ she is young.  Wait until they are older and are asking.  There is plenty of time for them to get to know anyone in their family that they want to know in the future.  Keep in mind his/her siblings are growing up in an unstable environment right now, or so it sounds.      I was the mid-life baby.  My 4 siblings were 18 - 25 years older than me, and despite efforts, I will always feel a bit estranged from them.  Nevertheless, I made the effort, and eventually they caught up.  We all live in different states and e-mail each other a couple of times a week or more now.    You have good intentions, but again, I think if you try to force this to work to soon, you will regret it.  It will all work out in the end.|`|kcmRROk0aa	I really feel for you -- that is quite a mess!    We're in kind of a similar situation. Our daughter comes from a MASSIVE family and it can be difficult trying to keep up with everyone, but we do try.    I have managed to get some info for a family tree and I keep in touch with as many members of her family as I can.     I just try to do right by her. I can't make these people take an interest in her, but at least when she grows up, she'll *know* that I *did* try.|`|165WRAJdaa	You can only do so much. I am in a similar situation as I am supposed to have an open adoption but both parents have decided they dont want that anymore. I have all the information written down (that I have been given) and a few pictures put away for my child. I also make a copy of the letters I send every year and I print out the correspondences from the agency. I just put it all in the file and will let my child have all of it when the time comes.|`|0sJsTN83aa	Open adoption just means that the bio parents can be involved, not that they have to be.  Often times a b-mom or the AP's will stop contacting each other over time for various reasons.  However, other children being involved is quite a different situation and an open adoption really doesn't have much to do with them.  And if the b-mom refuses to talk about the father, then there's nothing you can really do.  If you choose to let your son talk to her later on, he can ask her about it and maybe she'll tell him - but maybe not.  It might not be fair, but it's up to her.  Even if she had raised your son she may have never told him about his father, so you may just have to leave it at that.      The same goes with the b-mom's other children.  He is your son now, so his siblings are whatever other children you have in your family.  I would personally try to speak with the woman whose child also knows he/she is adopted and see if they're interested in establishing a relationship.  If they say yes, then just be happy with that for now, and don't try to move an entire mountain at once.  If they say no, then that is their right as parents and you should just leave the door open, but bow out gracefully and not force it onto them.      However, the children that don't know about their adoption should be left alone and you should respect the privacy of those parents.  Making you feel better (by showing your son his six siblings) might create a giant slew of emotional problems for those six other children, so be very careful with who you contact and what you say; and most of all be aware that it about the best interested of all parties involved, not just your desires for your son.    It sounds like a really tough spot overall though.  You really have to remember that, even though you left the door open, when you adopted him you severed his ties to those other family members.  Now you have four sets of parents to work with, all of whom will want different things for their children, so be prepared for some parents to not want involved.      I'm glad that you're very into open adoption, but with so many children involved you are on very thin ice no matter what you do.  Good luck.
giRRCXU4aa	Not at all. I know people who had it whether they were having a boy or a girl. It's just where the baby is laying at that point.

Most of them don't make it past a few hours but in ideal conditions - woman very fertile, sperm of good motility and healthy they can live 6-7 days. In theory the girl sperm live longer, the boy sperm swim faster but are less likely to survive for very long. The first challenge is getting into the womb, if they can't do that they will die within a matter of hours.

Some people treat their kids right, but have nasty homes. By nasty I dont mean 'they dont sweep often enough or have dirty dishes' I mean they have dog and human feces on top of the layers of dirt and between the holes in the floor and walls, sometimes dead animals lying in the house (on the couch, etc.) wherever they died, along with the nasty dishes and the dirty baby crawling thru it all. Children deserve so much better than that.    Also, not all kids end up in care. A lot of times, the family gets help to fix their issues and keep their kids at the same time. The parents get help finding stable housing, the mom gets help getting out of her abusive relationship, etc. Child protection agencies do all of this.

It's so beautiful and feminine!|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Violet Genevieve, Isla Genevieve, and Caroline Genevieve are all gorgeous.     I think my favorite is Isla Genevieve - it's absolutely fabulous!    also, how are you pronouncing Emmaline - "emma-leen", "emma-lynn" or "emma-line"?    Violet Kirkbride, Isla Kirkbride, and Caroline Kirkbride all sound so pretty. They have the long i sound in them, and so does Kirkbride, so they flow very nicely|`|EFzXvfbQaa	I LOVE    Vivienne Genevieve    VERY CUTE...and not that common|`|agTCqkLDaa	I was thinking Margaret Genevieve (I love the name Genevieve by the way!)    From your list, I like:  Audrey  Charlotte  Isla  Marjorie  Caroline    to be paired with Genevieve.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Audrey
y3u5WYDMaa	yaa totally  im 14  started my period a year ago have a 32A cup size my family is lk B-C  im 5'4 and my relative are from 5'0-5'6 well the girls in my family|`|0xiHNsmVaa	Yes, you are normal. Late periods,shortness and small boobs are not common but it is normal.|`|DYdXrVVeaa	im 14 and 5ft - i think ur normal|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	I'm 16 and 5ft. And no doubt l'll ever grow because my mum was smaller then me. You still got ages to grow yet. My friend began growing breasts when she was 15 and a half. Be patient. Your completely normal.|`|Bbdl1WXoaa	Same with me! i started my period over a year ago and i have really small boobs! Don't worry we are the same girl!|`|70kh6VSoaa	awww yes its normal but good look at it this way if they take longer to come they wont sag as fast|`|ZWKnjkBtaa	well maybe this will help i GTA a cousin that her boobs were small and they stared getting bigger like at the age of 18 and 19,i think that happen because your body just stared develop!|`|leU4QY9iaa	Everyones different :)  But it is normal :)|`|rTAvnldfaa	this is completely normal. everyone develops at different times even in the same family. i developed pretty early but my younger sister didnt but were the same size now. youll still be growing for at least another eight years yet so im sure youll grow by then xx|`|bVkIEpyGaa	Totally normal. My daughter was an 'a' cup at 14. Now a year later and she is bursting out of 'd' cups. Hang in there.|`|758cDKEFaa	im 18 in a couple weeks!  my boobs are A/B cup it depending on where i buy my bras though or i can be a C lol  to be honest i like having smaller boobs.  my spine is more curved than what a spine should be so i get a lot of back pain and if my boobs where bigger my back pain would be a lot worse!  im also short too but im proud of my figure/body plus im healthy and thats all that matters, stuff what others think!|`|d7vyYNLQaa	of course ur normal|`|dXDLeHNZaa	Of course, it takes a lot of time!|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	hey my aunt had A's all through jr high and then in high school she got D's so it all depends on your body and how you take care of your self. you'll get them when you least espect them... !|`|NdbrkrBZaa	Everyone develops differently so dont worry. Your body doesnt stop growing until your about 20 so you have got plenty of years left to develop fully.  However im 18 and 4ft 11 and been short since i hit my teens. I dont think you will grow much more in height im afraid but then again you may still have a growth spurt.   Everyone is different so dont go comparing yourself, but if its really worrying you maybe book an appointment and talk to you GP about your concerns.  Hope i have been of help :D|`|F2LLhbk2aa	Don't worry about it!  I'm as well 14 and only 5 ft 2.   So we're about the same height.     You're just a late bloomer, that's all :D|`|sKvIgiN4aa	yup yup|`|MSngi4wHaa	i was flat chested and hight 5ft 1 at 15 years. give your body time to grow you not fully developed till your about 18 so plenty of time dont worry.|`|S7tWzQH6aa	of course it's normal !!  i know people in my school who are exactly the same ....evn the period part of starting late..it all depends on your body...so don't worry about it! :]|`|zCgbeMQQaa	its normal everyones diffrent =]|`|T1T4vIZoaa	No|`|9wvUxmKVaa	This is normally.  People develop at different ages.  Don't worry =]|`|RpI8WcTgaa	Mmmhm this is exactly the same as me :) xxx
ZYlr9TSBaa	I got my bloody show on Tuesday, on and off all day. But other than that I felt fine, just big and uncomfortable lol. Wednesday morning 3:30am I woke up with back pains & felt a bit sick, which I thought was nothing but it turns out it was the start of my labour. They gradually got more and more painful throughout the day, I was feeling very nauseous and was on the loo a lot (sorry TMI). I finally had her at 3:45pm on Thursday :)|`|NAzAmFDnaa	The first part of the day that I went into labor, I had spotting and bleeding but no pain or contractions.  The last half of the day I had a constant urge to do  2 and was in the bathroom all afternoon and evening.  Finally at 11:30pm my waters broke while I was trying to "use" the bathroom.  That started off my contractions and baby was born 4hrs later.  The nurses said that my baby's head was nice and low when I got to the hospital and that is what was making me feel the pressure to go potty all day.|`|8QVlF2kLaa	No warning.  I woke up on the day of my due date and thought I had peed the bed!  My water had broken in the middle of the night.  Other then that I remember nothing.|`|kw80YHMLaa	Well for me i had a lot of discomfort before i went into labor. i had period type cramps and felt as if i needed to go to the toilet. My waters broke and i started to get contractions i went to the hospital and my twin girls were born really quickly
XoNKECCKaa	Because whenever there is a mean or popular girl in a book or movie, the author or writer always gives the girl the name of Ashley.     Its gotten twisted, and thats why people think its a snobby name...|`|dQF5jOiLaa	Well it is not that Ashley is a bad name it is just way over used!|`|785684c905911781314e17a1cecdeb2eaa	OMG...I like it better than most of the "trendy" overused names that people are naming their babies these days!|`|e0xpYnv1aa	It's so overused. I have 16 Ashleys in my cell phone.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I personally don't like it. It has been overused during the 80s and 90s so it seems pretty dated. It's really just not my style of name.|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	because it's so common. it would be nice if so many people weren't named ashley. i think thats the only reason|`|8OoqHpbIaa	i really like it :) Ashlee     but no one else does in the uk its not overly common but i heard its mega popular in the US so that may be why just lost its sparkle    also in the uk there was someone called ashleyn on big brother and she was a idiot! so bad associations|`|gRnARw6Oaa	Honestly? I know 5 Ashleys right now and have known probably 10 more Ashleys in my lifetime and everyone I've ever known has been a complete and total b****. But... I'm sure there must be a nice one out there somewhere! ;)|`|DP48dIxhaa	I think people hate it because it is extremelyy preppy and super common. Also very un-original. But I love it.....|`|S9F6RUncaa	lol thats my older sisters name|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I don't understand why so many people like it. I personally think it is an ugly name.|`|iIIXw6f5aa	Tabitha is a pretty name|`|AA11955868	I don't know that lots of people hate it, I think a lot of soon to be mothers don't put it on their list because there are just so many ashleys around now and they are worried about their child having a common name. That being said, I don't think people meet an 'Ashley' and go, god, what a sucky name. I think Ashley will decline in popularity for a while, but always remain a pretty strong name. It's nice and feminine so once everyone recovers from the 'unique' name phase all the Nevaeh's of the world who have children are probably going to say. Ashley, ashley is what I'm naming my child.|`|EbIXilnpaa	It's overused and most of the popular-snobby girls in movies are named Ashley or something as preppy.  I don't hate it but it's really stereotyped.|`|WOZgQgMbaa	It's just a name. Many people hate other names too. I know 2 Ashley's and one of them is kinda stupid and the other is like a emo wannabe. But that doesn't mean we need to be stereotypical about it. Just like a celebrity, when there are so many fans of that celebrity, there are bound to be haters.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Could be because it started out as a MAN'S name and people in the US decided it was going to be feminine.    Maybe they just don't like seeing boys get embarrassed because their masculine name suddenly became feminine.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Well I hate the name because it reminds me of a snob. I've met a lot of Ashley's and they all turn out to b mean-popular-snobs. It's a stereotypical name to think of it. Most girls named Ashley live up to being the common known stereotype of the name.|`|AhE8V76Zaa	In my opinion, it is a nice name. Though, is kinda related to dum ppl, i know girls named Ashley and they are not that great ppl i shall say. Plus, is too common (sp)|`|YgVtCX3raa	Uh gee lets see uhhhh COULD IT BE THE FIRST 3 LETTERS SPELL ASH????
IFqY2w1Paa	I'm 34 weeks along, and my doctor told me yesterday that at this point - if I went into labor - they would not stop it. At 36 weeks, the baby would be healthy and would only need minimal extra attention at birth. A baby born at 36 weeks has the same percentage of survival and doing well as a full-term baby (37 to 42 weeks). Hang in there! =)|`|tbeO3Lataa	Probably not. 36 weeks is still technically premature, but not to the point it is dangerous in any way.|`|cSm1zod4aa	I don't know for sure as I am only 5 months pregnant, but with all the researching pregnancy and delivery and all the shows, im pretty sure that after 35 weeks they will let you have the baby if you go into labor. Best of luck to you! Hope you have an easy delivery!!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	no not normally....only if 34 or earlier...sometimes not even at 34...|`|iMULlxdgaa	My doctor said they won't stop it at 36 weeks. I think its common practice.  COuld be 37 weeks is full term anyway,  so any time at the end of 36 weeks is cool to go!  COngrats and lucky you..you skipped the last four/three weeks of pure hell.|`|01vMpHkWaa	my doctor said that if i was to start labor anytime after 34 weeks then it wouldnt be stopped|`|giRRCXU4aa	My doctor told me if you go into labor at 36 weeks they won't stop it. So, if you go into labor now, you'll probably be having your little man. Gosh i'm only 31 weeks haha. Good Luck!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Hmmm...  Lasting?  You tired?  The baby should be in as long as possible, but most likely they will not stop labor.
LKu4YQZuaa	This is a good question..    Yes: Because alot of people tend to use sarcasm in a cruel way, and is more often than not going to be used in an argument.    No: Because its not actually bullying, i dont think a person would run home crying because somebody was being sarcastic.. I think its more of an added ingredient to spice bullying up a bit.|`|KbPrPuvhaa	Yes it can be.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	no they are supplements to bullying to strengthen it     and not all sarcasms are unspoken truths they are all unspoken observaions judged by their own OPINION|`|5D0KuT74aa	bullshit  if sarcasm is bullying then lets just ban talking, and going to school, hell, lets ban everything, and kill everyone|`|gq5sfgE5aa	not at all! Sarcasm    1. Natural reaction to stupidity  2. Makes life less dull  3. Helps to not tell people what you really think  4. One of my only talents   5. Helps me tolerate most people   6. You can use it to remain neutral  7. Is the answer to everyhing  8. Is simply amazing    Though I do use it to be condesending but it's my tone, not my words so sarcasm isn't really bullying|`|r0ISrLc1aa	well i hope not because i use sarcasm in like every conversation..not in a bullying way i dont think though. i usually use it in a truthful way..lol|`|AmqQ9it5aa	It can supplement the intensity of bullying ,but I think most people use it to make friendly jokes.|`|GK4G5Yt1aa	No, i find sarcasm to be sort of unspoken truths.  People just try to lighten hte blow with a smile.    Teenzy- Yes, not all sarcastic hits are unspoken truths, you are right, they are the unspoken thoughts of ones own opinion.|`|zHRWklEWaa	If it is intended to be hurtful then yes. However one can be sarcastic and not be hurtful.|`|AtTxzYXbaa	No.    Sarcasm is a great way to express disgust or hatred without yelling.|`|k6XRVeJxaa	No. I am sarcastic a lot of the time. I don't think I am a bully.|`|9zwSclnLaa	No, I don't think so.  It depends on if you intend it to be.  I think it's just brutal honesty.|`|RdMpPhhPaa	no! haha sarcasm is jst a form of expressing urself|`|dXDLeHNZaa	Sometimes I can be, yes.    I can't really explain it atm. Im way to tired :X|`|fgGXzs4vaa	I think a lack of tact as well as sarcasm could be *interpreted* as bullying, but that's by those who resemble the remarks made and taken as sarcastic or less than tactful.     Example: "Do these jeans make my *ss look fat?"  Answer: "No, your fat makes your *ss look fat."    Bullying or brutal honesty? You be the judge.|`|7PJber95aa	depends on what the person says
n6XYYyoLaa	craigslist.com|`|KWHiJbhaaa	try ebay or craigslist|`|1ezYfkX7aa	try walmart.com....they have the free site to store shipping...and alot of items are only .97 cents shipping, goodluck =)|`|uwxezFHjaa	i have the rainforest jumparoo and my son didn't like it they cant really jump good in it you would maybe be better off with a johnny jump up (there at walmart for like $20)|`|nY2hZrUMaa	ebay|`|64tdPWLGaa	I buy everything on craigslist
QM6wiVtVaa	You won't stop obsessing, ever! You'll just have to learn to control yourself, but with every new milestone in your pregnancy, you'll be worrying/wondering about something else. Congrats on the pregnancy!|`|8QVlF2kLaa	Sweetie..you've just literally found out that you're pregnant!  Give yourself a break...my god you've got 35 more weeks to go!  Take some deep breaths and just roll with it.  I you wanna look up stuff about being pregnant then do so.  Enjoy it!  You've got LOTS of time to get stuff done.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	You're not obsessed. You're behaving quite naturally. You've longed for something and now you have it. Imagine it was a new car you'd saved up for ages to get . . .  once you got it you'd drive it everywhere . . .  wouldn't you?! same thing really.    Enjoy! The only thing that's wrong is that you think you're being obsessive.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	haha im comin on my 11 weeks and im still doing all that ... even when im at work ill go on the internet on my fone and when im on a break ill read pregnancy book and magazines. dont worry about obsessing, its a wonderful thing ure going theru right now. enjoy every moment!!! but of course get ur job done too.. depending on what kinda artist u are maybe u can coorperate pregnancy into ur art. u can start painting ur childs nursery too.|`|giRRCXU4aa	Well this might not mean as much since I didn't go through 9 months of trying, but the best I can tell you is to keep yourself busy. Of course it never leaves your mind but you've gotta keep busy or the next 9 months are realllllyyyy gonna drag. Good Luck and Congratulations!|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Its normal your just excited over the baby. Try going out with friends and hanging out.|`|kw80YHMLaa	its hard to not obsess when your pregannat but research can be good and bad for example researched the nest prams and car seats helped me when i was pregnant but i looked up child birth and i was phyically sick with worry. try and relax its such a magic time especially with your first child|`|cSm1zod4aa	I did the exact same thing when I found out I was pregnant. You aren't going to be able to make yourself stop.. lol it just dies down a little bit after a while. I am 5 months and still look at tons of pregnancy sites everyday.. how can we not? its so exciting!! Don't worry, your not obsessing.. your just being an expecting mommy!! Best of luck to you guys!!
vsFJZRkGaa	yes that's fine.    i'd go without the bath sling or the bouncer.   you don't need bath sling, you can comfortable just use your arm.  and the bouncer can be a waste if the child grows out it. We wanted to et a swing as it would last longer, but then opted for a rocker that turns into a chair instead! its great! it starts of laying down, then you gradually sit it up unitl it turns into a chair for a toddler. its great for long term use.|`|3ZiQreGoaa	yes those are some basics but as the baby gets older you want to invest in a high chair and walker. It will make your life easier.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	maybe a baby carrier. you will eventually need a crib when baby outgrows the bassinet, but its okay for now. It seems like at bare minimum you have what you need aside from clothes, diapers, shampoos ect. You will need a highchair in a few months.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	you will bee fine but I would trade the bouncer in for a swing. We used the swing a lot and still do at 10monthss 3 weeks. I like to put her in the swing while I get ready for work.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Are you planning to co-sleep?  If not, frankly, I'd skip the bouncer, bassinet and bath sling and buy a crib.  Cribs are the safest place for a baby when they are not sleeping with their parents.  Most bassinets have weight and size limits that your child will pass before she or he is ready for a toddler bed.    You also need somewhere to change the baby - it doesn't need to be a while fancy changing area, but it's nice to have at least a changing pad that's firmly attached to a dresser or table top, with some washable covers.|`|52bAHCaUaa	I don't have a sling, although one might be quite useful. I have a bouncer but she has only been in it once or twice, so I wouldn't get another one myself.     Other than that, everything else you pretty much need! :) You don't completely need a stroller, but they are much nicer! Try to get one where the infant car seat latches onto it, it will last much longer!|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	You have the essential large items there.  One useful thing you could add fairly cheaply would be one of those baby slings you wear to carry the baby on your chest when out and about.  You could also do with a baby monitor.      Remember women were having babies long before all these fancy gadgets got invented so don't worry about getting the best of everything; as long as it is safe and comfortable it will be fine.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	your gonna need a high chair, and maybe this  http://www.target.com/dp/B000X2LBQM/ref=...    its a basinet and a play pen and a changing table  you might also need a baby bath and a baby moniter|`|JU3TLLYjaa	That works well, most baby stuff is a waste.  I would say maybe swing instead of bouncer, swing lasts longer.   Honestly probably don't need a high chair, i have a swing that adjusts from sitting to laying kin of, i just sit him up to feed him. Bath sling you don't NEED either.     A nice to have if you are home a lot is a carrier or wrap, I have one similar to a moby wrap and it makes doing things around house easier.    then of course, bottles if you need them, clothes (buy 3-6 months + baby may even need those at birth..you waste money with newborn) diapers and wipes and whatnot

s4aX6bF6aa	how old is your baby...just because she's got teeth doesn't mean that she's particularly ready for chunky babyfood...i've had eight children and i didn't start chunky baby foods until they were a year old...i gave them all time to learn to like the early stuff and keep with their formula until they were a year old...but mostly she'll let you know when she's ready for more solid food...but if she's gagging on it she's not ready for it...give it some time.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would try to give her something else, sounds like she doesnt really like what you are feeding her or its too chunky. But at nine months she shouldnt have that big of a problem with it..what food are you giving her like peas or something? I would try something else|`|AA12243380	Stop pushing it because she isn't ready for it yet.    Don't worry, there aren't any grownups who can only eat purees,  Just relax and try again later.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	back off a while, i think she is trying to tell you she isn't ready for it yet; try again in a month...no harm in it, and she won't come to 'hate' the forcing of the stage 3s...you don't want a negative association with them...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Babies don't chew with their teeth, they mash with their gums.  The front teeth aren't really good for chewing up food anyway, just for biting off pieces.     Are the third foods that chunky?  Do you think she's gagging because she's choking or is she gagging because she hates something about the food (taste/texture.)?  Does she chew other food?  Maybe try something else, to get her used to chewing?    Honestly, the chunkier baby foods worry me a bit, because they look and taste so much like the smoother ones, I worry that my son will just slurp them down.  Perhaps you could try boiling some pieces of carrot until they're very soft, cooling them and giving her a piece to see what she does.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Nuts to the stuff in the jars. Let her feed herself. Give her something she can pick up and gnaw on, not tiny dice. Steamed broccoli and asparagus work well.    Useful: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/  http://cspinet.org/reports/cheat1.html  http://borstvoeding.com/voedselintroduct...|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	maybe shes not ready   just give her a week or 2 and try again|`|w4zjmhxoaa	My son always hated 3rd foods.  We just stuck with 2nd foods, and then he went straight to table food at 10 months.  There's no law saying she has to eat 3rd foods.  I would just give her what she will eat.|`|oIFMohfUaa	It's her gag reflex.   It's there for a purpose...it keeps her from swallowing what her throat and tummy aren't ready for.      Go back to the smoother foods.  Just because she has teeth does not mean she knows how to chew and mash it enough to pass the throat and gag reflex mechanism.    Take it slowly...you don't want her to fight you at feeding time...you want it a good experience!    Good luck~|`|AA11029380	Maybe she's not ready for lumpy food.  Wait a few more weeks and try again.

5JFG5W4uaa	Dear Mommy...be careful that the baby is not exposed to sun, glare of sand & water, and dress the babe in woolen garments then carry a blanket if you stop on beach and the wind is blowing. It is safer and easier to carry the baby in the carrier facing front, this so the child can watch and experience what is happening around you. Don't frighten the babe by going too close to the vast ocean. The first impressions should be fun and enjoyable for both of you.  Spartawo...|`|AA12243380	I'd dress him warmly and put him in the carrier.  Have fun!|`|XjgQ3jDZaa	Better to go overboard, than not enough.  I would go with the snow suit and a scarf to cover his face especially if it's windy.  Definitely use the carrier.  Most important...HAVE FUN!
9F6EKGLsaa	Well, yea I was allowed to play with toy guns when I was a child, however there where rules when it came to the use of it, such as, do not point it at the road (we lived next to a main road), don't point it a humans, animals.     Also my mum took the time to stress how dangerous guns could be in the wrong hands and that they can destroy peoples lives. I think it is important to teach children the boundaries between real violence and fantasy violence, because this will obviously cause the same questions to aries when they play video games.|`|oMAXAQA0aa	They aren't old enough yet. 3 months and 20 months.   But when they are old enough, most of the toy guns I've seen recently,  are so far removed from what an actual gun looks like, they'd be better off pretending cops and robbers with a cordless drill.  With the exception of electronics, everything has turned to suck over the last few decades.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Toy guns yes.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	yes    My 8 year old already knows how to shoot a real one, and she hits the bulls-eye|`|bfjs9wSLaa	Not BB guns - those are SUPER dangerous   just water guns, or the ones that shoot out little rubber thingies.  but, no matter what the water guns are for outside by our pool, and the ones that shoot out at little rubber thingies, can not be shot at humans or animals|`|838VJJGvaa	My mom doesn't allow any type of firearm toy or real in the house.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Yes but only water guns, my son's not really into the plastic type of toy gun anyway but generally I'm not a huge fan of them.|`|5RoYyprkaa	My neice gets to. She just doesn't point them at people or at animals.|`|96ojhoXvaa	yes|`|nfzQkvqraa	only water guns in the summer to keep cool.  I'm not a big fan of guns.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Yes. Same etiquette as with real guns apply. No pointing at people or animals.|`|L9cULlc0aa	No and I throw away all of the bottles that come with baby dolls too.    Breast is best!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	We were let play with guns when we were small - we played cowboys and indians etc.  BUT we got in trouble if we pointed them at people or animals.  I will let my son have one, but he will be taught that REAL guns can kill people and not to point toy guns at anybody.|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	not at all. no toy weapons what so ever. we don't even buy water guns. we get the animal head toys that shoot water so they have a toy similar to that of a water gun. after watching columbine i will never have guns of any sort around. funny i feel this way being that i am married to someone in the army.
PKHZNS1Paa	i honestly thought i did, but i think it was just in my head! it was a few days after "the sex" (meaning the only sex that i have ever had that pregnancy was not prevented.) and i felt really tired and my boobs were killing me! about 3 weeks later i got a positive pregnancy test! lol|`|IvonJgPraa	no not that early|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	not really. maybe two weeks after ovulation/conception...|`|cSm1zod4aa	No you cannot. The egg isnt even implanted into the uteran wall until 2 weeks after conception. Thats when you MIGHT start getting symptoms as your pregnancy hormone (HCG) starts to rise.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I don't think so but everyone is different and studies can only show so much.  They can't run studies on every pregnant woman in the world so who knows, maybe you can.
nbNhvJZjaa	All parents have accountability for their children under 18.They are there for a hedge of protection till children get old enough to make mature and wise decisions.They are there to train you because you don't know whats best and also what is their best interest at heart.  Mom has the final answer on her side while you're still under her roof.After that you can learn the hard way casting her experiences  of painful mistakes aside.All mothers aren't perfect but checking for porn between your mattresses,or just checking is her privilege of vigilance.I will say once she scanned quickly and didn't find a trend   of harm or danger regardless of her affection or amusement she should move on for a long time unless premonition (strong concern)  prompts her again.But to daily read is an area mom needs dad to   step in and dig his feet in and tell mom He loves both of you but moms daily diary snooping is out of order! Sorry Duckie ,but if you're tight with dad,and daughters usually are, you could talk to him about it.But I would add that you wouldn't mind if she scanned once in a long while because she as a mom may worry about you but your diary you want to be between you and G-d.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	No I respect my children and they respect me.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	I always ask my mom if she reads my stuff and she says no because her mom read her stuff and she hated it.She never lies to me so I trust her|`|SKJb6eLKaa	I'de NEVER EVER read my childrens' diary!  That's pitiful, you should have enough dignity to not need to see what is going on in your childs life (and if they trust and confide in you theyd TELL YOU and if you do read their diary maybe thats the reason why they dont!)|`|5RoYyprkaa	my mom started going through my stuff when i turned 15. i guess it's just a parental thing where all parents think their kids are doing drugs and doing things like that. that's what they use for an excuse when we find out they're going through our things. truth is, i was doing drugs, but my parents never figured that. they were more worried about if i might be having sex anyway. i confronted my mother, and told her that she didn't have to go through my things, i would tell her what was going on. i told her what drugs i did and that i was having sex. she didn't go through my stuff again, and she didn't get mad. she just felt left out of my life... she's been trying to control it ever since i moved out too...|`|UX3xjsFlaa	I think you have the right if you feel there is something suspicious or something you wouldnt approve of going on. For example- a daughter whose mother told her she wasnt allowed to date at her age having a "suspected" boyfriend, going out after curfew, spending too much time online, etc.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	my mum does the exact same thing  she even opens my mail     she read my diary which had all the details about my best friend geting with my bf and then another best friend going out with my bf 4 days after we broke up     its bad enough that she read it but she cant keep the fact that she did read it to herself and now she hates my two best friends (the bf thing happened 5 years ago, im over it but she refuses to)     i ended up haivng to throw my diary away because she would just be so nosy|`|hTieELhTaa	I had a book of poems that I kept I guess kind of like a diary i would put thoughts and feeling in it to. my mom went through it then grounded me for the feeling I put in there and stuff i wrote that she didnt agree with. i never wrote again and I felt like nothing was safe unless I kept it bottled up inside.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	A parent would be negligent not to do this. If my child was into drugs or illegal activity I would want to know about it right away before it ballooned into a major problem. I don't care about the piddly stuff though.|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	She probably was worried about you. Sit down with her and ask her not to calmly!|`|AA10953999	My daughter is almost 9, she has a dairy. I doubt there is anything worth reading in it lol But if she were older I wouldn't read it. I view journals/diaries as beneficial to ones well being, besides I wouldn't want to betray her trust in me.|`|p3xohPUAaa	sweetie my mom read my diary,looked under my bead and even rifled through my drawers and found my "massager" the best thing i can tell ya to do is get better at hiding things. Try hiding things behind your drawers in between mattresses..in stuffed animals gets creative then when u have a chance move FARRR away. Shes going through your stuff means she doesnt trust you and prolly never will.
WEekT4b6aa	Well, unless he's willing to give the mother of his baby financial support, he should sign over all parental rights to her so she can give the baby up for adoption.  If he's not willing to financially support the baby for the next 18 years, then he has no right to give the baby's mother any hearburn.  cw|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I agree. It is illegal for the mother to give up a baby for adoption unless the father has signed over his parental rights. If she gives up the child w/o his consent she could get into some trouble, and the adoption would not be valid...he could get the child back if he wanted.  The only way to find her is hire a PI. If you know the town she is in he could possibly contact the police and let them know, they may be able to help you find her.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Ask her, those questions would not be public knowledge.|`|4el3goYMaa	Well, by law, she is actually not allowed to give the baby up for adoption without informing the father. If she does not she will be at risk of going to jail.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Phone local hospitals, or ask relatives of the biological mother.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	First of all, he needs to sign on the putative father registry at the courthouse in the town where she last lived.  By doing this, hopefully, it will assert his parental rights.  He can hopefully find out, maybe with a fee involved, where the mother has moved to, by asking the post office how to obtain a forwarding address for her.  If she has moved out of state, he will also need to sign the putative father registry there.      He needs to send the mother a certified letter, stating his parental rights, and that he refuses to allow the child to be placed for adoption.  Her parents, friends, and family are sources of where she might be.  Time is of vital importance right now to do this, as many states have a time limit on the putative father registry, such as our state (Arkansas) has 10 days for the father to assert his rights.  Legal aid should help him with his search, as well as Child Protective Services.  He can also go to the police, and basically fill out a missing persons report, on her and his then unborn child, which can help him.  He cannot wait any more time to hope she'll show up.  He will lose his rights if he does.  Her consent to adopt forms can be used to surrender her rights, although not her responsibilities, and he might be able to obtain child support from her.      Depending on his state's laws, he might be obligated to place an ad in the paper, and he should search his name for any ads placed in the legal section where he lives, to see if there are any notices to him.    Have him do a search for the putative father laws and his state, so that way, he can see some more of his rights, and time limits, and how to assert them.  All putative father registries I'm aware of must have the man say, "I -legal name-, believe I am the father of a child to be born to the biological mother -her legal name-, and the baby is due on -date-.  Her last known address is:  -address- and her telephone was -number- and I have tried to contact her by these methods:    I wish to assert my parental rights, and refuse to place this child for adoption.  My legal address is: and my contact phone is:.      Due to the fact that it's tax time, her last employer might have a forwarding address for her, since they have to have sent her W-2 forms to her.  If you need more assistance, contact me.    It is also important that he start a bank account to show he is willing to provide financial support for the baby.  If he knows if it's a boy or girl by ultrasound, it can help in the search.  I'd start by calling every adoption agency in his local phone book, and sending every one of them a form letter stating who he is, by registered mail.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Unless a friend or relative leaks where she went to have the baby it will honestly not be easy. The Dr. Phil case that someone mentioned I think that had to due with the father not registering on the Putative father registry  list. This is a list that most states have where a (unwed) man who feels he may have fathered a child has to sign up by a certain time in order to claim his rights.  Many men dont know about this resiteries but in most cases they (the courts)  will say ignorance is bliss.  Also a father must be resistred on the PFR list in the state where the baby is born. So thats why many women will hop a state to give birth because even if the childs father resgister on the state where she lives if she goes to another state and the father is not on that list, he is out of luck. So it can require resistering in more then one state all boarding states and more.  Many also require the father to have taken an active interest in the baby this can be viewed as keeping in contact with the mother, helping her out with her medical bills, providing things for the child.  If your boyfriend has any emails/letters with the mother he should save those.    Best to get on this right away if the baby was born about a week ago time could be running out.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Unfortunately, all of that information is protected by privacy laws.    Hospitals can't tell you what patients they've seen, or if that person had a baby.  Adoptions are sometimes so secret, it puts the CIA to shame.     Adoptions are final and the records are sealed permanently.  Forever.    Basically, if the woman, or her family, doesn't "fess up" there's no way to find that baby.    She can easily get around the father's rights by lying.  If she tells the authorities he's dead, or just makes up a name, there's nothing that can be done.    This exact scenario played out on Dr. Phil a short time ago.  A woman deliberatly lied to keep her baby away from the child's father, put it up for adoption, and refused to tell him where the child was, despite the fact SHE was still in regular contact with the adoptive family and saw the child at least once a week.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	He needs to see if there is a putative father's registry in the state you reside, every state bordering your state and if he thinks she may have gone further...those states too.     When the child is placed for adoption, the courts are SUPPOSED to look on these registries and if the mother's name is on there and attached to your boyfriend's name then that should at least slow down the process.     If he wants the baby, then he needs to lawyer up.......she really is in the driver's seat.     She could name someone else and have that person go in and relinquish their parental rights, she could tell the hospital and the agency she is clueless of the father's name.....whatever.|`|LgMoGUoqaa	He should sit down and talk with the young lady.  Maybe she will give him some information.  It seems like he and the young lady were on rocky terms because if they were on good terms he would have known about the birth.  Sometimes as women we need to step back and let our boyfriends handle their own mess.  Be careful, How he treated that young lady maybe the same way he is gonna treat you. Good luck on your search.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	if you know what town she had the baby look in the newspapers they always have birth announcement listed
0sJsTN83aa	My friend has an older child that they adopted openly.  From my understanding, the b-mom gets to visit every other month if she chooses too and that's about the extent of their relationship.      Their daughter seems to be just fine with it.  If I had to equate it, I would say that it's like having your parents divorced to a degree.  They're aware of the other parental figure, and they can see them or contact them freely, but the b-mom doesn't live there.  So it's slightly like having two families or a father that comes in/out of the picture.  They've been very open with her about everything, and she talks openly and proudly about it with no sense of regret that anyone can tell.      When she gets even older that may be another story, but hopefully she'll be alright as long as her adoption is normalized in her eyes.  I've heard that a lot of adopted children can get emotional issues if people act like being adopted is a bad thing, so the better the families attitude the better the child's chances to be fine with everything.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Most open adoptions I have known of have not worked.|`|4el3goYMaa	I gave my daughter up for adoption (it was an open adoption) over 4 years ago. I had not planned to give her up, but I was young and trying to finish high school and a family friend and her husband convinced me to let them adopt her.  Although I was supposed to be able to visit her, I still haven't been allowed to. They will allow me to send gifts and talk to her on the phone, but they always come up with an excuse not to allow me to. I still think I made the right decision and have no regrets though, b/c she has a great life!|`|fPFXJr3eaa	Here is a story about Open Adoption a 16 year old girl wrote a few years ago...

I saw my bio parents a couple times a year, akthough i didnt know they were my bio parents until i was 13.

4kJrDvDYaa	i am 36 weeks and the things that make me feel soo much better are:    -doing my hair everyday    -putting on make-up    -dressing up a little every once in a while    -getting fingers && toes done =]    -my eyebrows waxed    -and flaunting my VERY pregnant body around!      people love to stare because im quite fond of my blooming belly =]|`|iMULlxdgaa	I agree,  try out some nice maternity clothes that make you feel beautiful,  remember that its not everyday and for ever that you cna be pregnant!  Make the most of it,  do your hair go to the salon,  get a new hair color (its ok really)  get you nails done,  do your makeup,  workout (depending on how far along you are and with your docs approval of course)  and remember that lots of people think apregnant woman is soo beautiful,  its just us that don't thinkits so beautiful going to the bathroom 50 times a day,  nausea, vomiting, weight gain, etc: etc: Etc:!|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Make sure you get some cute maternity clothes.  There is so much crap out there that makes us poor pregnant ladies look like huge frumps!  I know for myself that showering every day, doing my hair, putting on a little make up and CUTE clothes really helped.  Show off that belly, don't hide it!  And also, finding a GREAT pair of maternity jeans was key.  I thought the ones I found at the mall made me look like a troll so I took my favorite pre-pregnancy jeans to a tailor and had her morph them into maternity jeans.  So awesome!! Happy rest of your pregnancy-enjoy it!|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	buy some nice undies and pretty clothes that make you feel good there are some out there|`|1ezYfkX7aa	The only thing that seems to lift my spirits being so far along into my pregnancy now and pretty much looking like i am going to pop now and still have 10wks to go....is doing my hair real nice and attempting to put on just a little make up..not to  much...just enough to look like i gave a crap how i looked that morning.

Here are just a few suggestions...    - One word - lingerie. The standby and go-to option for all things sexy. Yes, they do make pregnancy lingerie as well! Many maternity stores stock it, as well as department stores and lingerie stores who should have it in maternity sizes.    - Take a salon day! Get your hair cut and styled, maybe some waxing (to help with all that "sprouting" hair), and then make a date with your significant other to show it off!    - Flaunt what you have always thought was sexy on your body. Sure, everything is changing on your body, but your best features are still there! And don't forget to take advantage of your growing, umm, cleavage.    - Last but not least, flaunt your pregnancy! I know a woman who made a plastered imprint of her pregnant belly and it is now hanging on her wall. Yeah, you don't need to go that far! But remember that most men find pregnancy INCREDIBLY attractive. Take advantage of that!    Kudos on that baby!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	me to at 25 weeks  i feel like a blimp and not cute at all i think i might go get my hair something this week or a pedic. what to come with me|`|a0rmkwf8aa	well i have never been pregnant before. im actually trying to conceive. you're going to feel tired and stuff. i guess try not to think about it so much which i know could be very difficult. hope this helped. congrats on your pregnancy by the way. throw some baby dust my way.|`|x7JBccGzaa	get your belly painted   its relaxing and looks pretty:]|`|GZ5UDZ4Taa	i feel the same way and i'm 21 weeks
zcYl3ftTaa	Apparently there are still people still confuse a babys right to eat with a womans right to expose her breasts. Some people still confuse the lactating breast with a sexual organ. Maybe I have no right to tell them they are mistaken.    Maybe taking away baby doll's bottles would help with this confusion.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	I think that's taking it a bit far. They will learn about breastfeeding when they become adults, playing with bottles and dolls will not influence their decision to breastfeed when they're mothers themselves, they're just kids. No I don't think the bottles that come with dolls should be thrown away.|`|remZ5gDUaa	Its ok either way. They're learning to be nurturing. My daughters didn't know what bottles were used for since they never took em. When they got old enough for solids, I put breastmilk in sippie cups so they never used em. My 1st learned to feed her babies with a bottle but my 2nd refused to feed them with a bottle. She would get her dolls and "breastfeed" em. She said the dolls liked it better. Lol. It was the cutest thing!! Lol|`|wFVLP5l3aa	lol good question i think that they can keep the bottles but also teach breastfeeding so kids know theres 2 ways to feed babies    iv just had my son and i breastfeed him and now my partners little sisters  "breastfeed" their dollies cause theyv seen me do it its so cute.  they also give me their dollies to feed for them haha  me and their mum spend a lot of time explaining what im doing and why|`|70kh6VSoaa	wow|`|3af544c64c1a18f83fe38882654d08e4aa	no don't be silly there is nothing wrong with bottle feeding your children i had to with my first as i n early died and was not well enough to look after her then breast fed the next two then bottle the forth as had to back to work. plus i don't want to see lots of little girls with there tops up and dolls on there boobs. xx|`|DXLfxoTNaa	hahahahaha!    No I don't. That's cute though. I love watching one year olds care for the baby dolls with a bottle.  I do foresee problems with teaching them to breastfeed when a six year old plays mommy with her friends, though. If the mom wants her daughter to breastfeed when she has children, she has plenty of time to teach those values.|`|0sqRwzcfaa	well it depends is your baby premuchure if it is you need to keep them|`|i8C7pvJCaa	My children never had bottles, and neither did their baby dolls.|`|kyL7UNeRaa	i believe that you should let you child have the choice.  when they grow up and have kids they will choose whether or not to breast or bottle feed.  i dont think that bottle feeding a baby doll is going to change her mind in the future.  let kids be kids.|`|AA12243380	Only if they want to, I guess.    My twins have baby bottles and I'm going to breastfeed their little brother.    They're only toys.  :-)  I think that if you don't even want pretend bottles then that's your choice but don't tell me my kids can't play with them.    Then again, my twins got bottles.  :-D    Also.... what would you do if you had a boy?  Would you make him pretend to breastfeed or would you let him bottle feed his doll?  ;-)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No. Bottle feeding isn't a sin, so why do some people still act like it is?|`|S3DFPmjaaa	Breastfeeding is certainly more convenient, better for the baby etc etc but even breastfeeding mothers use bottles sometimes.      It will have a more lasting impact if you teach your daughter (whatever her age) that 'breast is best', let her see mothers of all kinds feeding their young (human and animal) and let her choose- or else don't buy the dolls that come with bottles!    BTW, it's not just our daughters that need to value breastfeeding.  Our sons need to appreciate it too so that they are supportive of their partners when that time comes :)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Hm, interesting.  I don't know that the bottles need to be thrown away -- that would be sending the message that using a bottle is somehow "wrong".  And since it isn't really, that doesn't seem right.    But I have known some little girls to play at breastfeeding their dolls.  Why not?|`|LWXRVO5Haa	Yes I do. Breastfeeding should be normalized.
VERrlErvaa	How clean my kids faces are compared to all the other ones I see.  I mean honestly, is it that hard to keep some tissues handy?    Nothing I hate worse than seeing a kid with snot running out of their nose and down to their mouth .It's disgusting.

My delivery was awful was in labor/induced for a little over 48 hours ended up with an infection and had BAD strong contractions and wasn't progressing anymore than 5 cm and ended up with a csection. Epidural took 3 tries to get it in and my left hand was 4 times bigger than normal because of all the fluids they were pumping in made it swollen during the csection and just from all the inducing for the past 48 hours and medication for the infection. I was so swollen all over it took them 12 tries to actually get the IV back in. OMG it was awful :( finally then the next morning they had me walk which went ok but really hard to stand and not hurt felt like all my insides were going to fall out. and they took the cathader out and gave me 8 hours to pee on my own and i couldn't so they had to put the cathader in after i wasn't numb anymore and drain me out and then the doctor told me i had 4 hours to pee on my own again and finally the LAST minute i went on my own thank god otherwise i would of had to sleep with that damn thing in me. The process to have my son was awful but soooo totally worth it. He's my snuggle bug. Very precious sure put mommy and daddy through heck though, lol. At least i know i have to have csections in the future so we don't have to do that again. I ended up having a small pelvic so there was no way i would of been able to have him normally. CONGRATS on your daughter!!!|`|ioZeveazaa	Awww she is a little sweetheart. Very Cute!! I can't wait for my little girl to get here...thanks for posting the picture of Emma...gives me the "oomph" I need to keep going..=))|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	OMG HUNNY SHE IS GORGEOUS!!!!!    I had my daughter on the 15th January, she weighed 7lbs 6oz and was born at 3:45pm :)    My labour started, I guess on Tuesday with my bloody show. I woke up at 3:30am Wednesday feeling a bit sick and with really bad backache, which I thought nothing of. When I woke up again in the morning around 10, I realised the pains were coming and going, albeit irregularly. They carried on all day, and evening, I felt SO sick (bit like my morning sickness had returned!) and they were getting stronger but not more frequent. I finally had enough at half 4 in the morning Thursday after getting no sleep.... went into hospital by 5am, had her at 3:45pm after 45 minutes of pushing :) so... I don't know how many hours that'd be, I have major baby brain lol!    Welcome to mummyhood :D|`|PFO1jxZGaa	Thats my birthday :)   Any ways congrats she is really precious and I just love her hair. All of mine were born with almost none :)   Thats a long time to be in labor and pushing but seconde ones are usually faster. My first one was 11 hours I think with 50 min pushing, second was 6 hours with 20 min of pushing and third was 5 hours with 4 pushes, so like you see the times go down a lot :)   Good luck with everything|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	awwwwwwww your daughter is soooooooooo adorable congrats!!! =)|`|iTEf1dP3aa	She is gorgeous! Congrats! That is a long time....I'm sure seeing and holding your child would make you want to do it as many times as you would have to...All I remember from my first pregnancy was the doc telling me to push and in a matter of 20 mins. he was out! lol I really had to push about 10 mins before he got there but he wasnt even in the building, he was in his office down the street from the hospital...Its the worst feeling to have to push and the nurses are telling you not to and to wait...I'd do it again tho...|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	Awww she is so beautiful!      My first was about 12 hours labor and he was out in about 10 min of pushing (he was also 8lb9oz and ripped me in two lol)  My daughter's labor length was about the same and i had her out in only a couple pushes.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Your daughter is adorable! Congratulations!|`|xPR7g0wFaa	Beautiful,You must be so proud.Sweety, you did a great job. All 3 of my kids were between 9-10 hours of labor, my longest time pushing was maybe 5 minutes.Congratulations on a job well done.|`|AA11056379	aawww...she is simply gorgeous!!!    I luv the hair!!..lol...    my first son took hs sweet time coming out also..he was well into 30 hr range. But..it is all history now..    my second son..no time for epidermal, or anything..poof..he was out in minutes!    bless to you and your sweet baby girl.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	She is absolutely breathtaking.  She is sooo precious.  I like the first picture. My son was 8 lbs 8 oz, born at 8:08 pm, 16 hour labor, one day late after due date.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	my first was 10 hours 4 & 1/2 of it was pushing.  My daughter was about 6 hours 2 & 1/2 pushing and she was finally delivered by c section.  Your baby is adorable!|`|1UpR1vSCaa	SHE IS COMPLETELY GORGEOUS CONGRATS I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET MY PRINCESS GOD BLESS YOU AND EMMA|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Congrats.  My first, I was in labor for 6 hours and pushed about an hour.  My second, labor for only 1 freaking hour and pushed for half an hour.   The second was the worst ever! Because the baby came so fast, my body had  no time to adjust.|`|QuEI78Apaa	What a cutie!! I like Emma....I am having a little girl Feb 18th , I think I might name her Isabelle....Labor with my 1st was 12 hours, 3 hours of pushing....then his heart started struggling so I had an emergency c-section|`|gFiRi5xnaa	I haven't had my son yet, but I wanted to say that the 2nd picture is SO cute. Congrats on the beautiful baby, and all that hair is so cool, lol, it took me a year to grow that much.|`|kw80YHMLaa	she is so cute love the hair congrats u must be trilled. My labor was 4 hours with twins so i was really lucky u had a long  one|`|QuokZhuqaa	Wow she is so cuteee!!!!!  (:    Congratss!!!! I'm hoping she lives a very healthy life(:|`|1gF9QVy9aa	She's beautiful!!  Another Y!A little miracle!! :)    My labor with my son was truly a rollercoaster....here's my breakdown....    11am-1pm....light contractions about 5-8 minutes apart    1pm- admitted into the hospital    1pm-4pm...light contractions, slow to dilate    4pm...midwife broke my water!     4:01pm-7pm...HARDCORE painful labor with contractions 2-3 minutes apart!  I only dilated to 7cm at that point.....after all that hard work!!     7pm...epidural....ahhhhhh.......    7:10pm-11pm....beautiful sleep.....    11pm....midwife comes in to check my cervix and WAHOOO....I'm a full 10cm!  I gear up to start pushing and my midwife allows my ENTIRE family to come into my birthing room (it was a slow night there!).      11:10pm-11:42pm....push push push!!    11:42pm....My 7lb, 20 inch long beautiful son was born! :)    So....I had a very up and down labor!! I tried to do without the epidural, but I just couldn't.  The pain was just tooo intense for me to handle.      Congrats!!!!!!!|`|IAM1O7Hlaa	I melt =)  congratulations , i am 33 weeks pregnant and i just wanted to say hi to the new mom and the little princess =)
1MEnCmwoaa	she has a lot of hormones going crazy in her right now and as hard as it is on you try and keep calm with her.   it sounds like she is a bit extreme though! i am quite moody also and don't want much to do with sex so that can be normal. a lot of women feel like that. plus, she is probably super insecure about her body because she probably doesn't look real pregnant yet, just chubby!   ask her how she feels and just listen to her! i think men have a hard time with that one. my husband always thinks when i complain or get upset it is something he needs to help me solve... sometimes we just need an ear. go give her a hug and let her get it all out.   also, it is ok that you get frustrated too! let her know how her actions are making you feel, but tell her nicely! maybe she doesn't realize how moody she is being. or how it is affecting you.|`|0viZhxi6aa	My biggest fear when I was pregnant was that my husband would cheat on me. He grew up in an environment where his mom slept with anything that moved, so he is completely faithful, but I was still scared. I was a mean little b i t c h and didn't go back to normal until my daughter was 4 or 5 months old. At one point in time he moved out because he couldn't deal with the accusations anymore. We eventually worked past that once he was able to participate in the pregnancy more (sonagram, hear the heart beat, feel the baby, ect) But all I can really say is just be patient and kind. Good luck!!!|`|Xcyaju2vaa	Be glad you are not the one who is pregnant. Then your gf would be posting about you! There are a lot of changes that happen-but it is temporary! Learn to say "yes dear" and ask her if she needs anything. Learn to take really long trips to the store and fast food places. When you see what she goes thru to have the baby, you will have a lot more respect. Good luck!!|`|eeyGYRcPaa	i'm the same way with my husband and i feel really bad for him! he deals with me! just take it one day at a time! i promise it will get better, it's just our hormones that make us crazy! lol|`|5QSpBBaIaa	being pregnant sux and no offence no guy is going to understand.i know its hard but your gonna have to just deal with it.hormones are crazy!|`|kJ7tmwE6aa	ignore her.   or just stare at her when shes yelling or whatever.  let her know she wont get anything her way if she keeps acting like that.  its just another stage, itll be over soon. before you know it :)  being pregnant sucks.|`|YuJwUIy7aa	hormones! sorry hun, but get use to it..this is just the beginning. pregnancy does craaaaazy things to your moods. im 11weeks and know exactly what going on with your gf..we dont mean to mean.. its just a mental thing while our bodies are adjusting to all these changes. hang in there, and keep up what youre doing. she'll appreciate u more in the end. look at the bright side, it only last a couple months :) good luck!|`|6yYeCVQFaa	It's nice that want to know how to deal with this and it's not always easy considering a pregnant, moody women can be hard to deal with. Men can go through their own mood swings during pregnancy as well so it probably makes matters worse for both of you. Know this, the hormones that are being pumped throughout her body are causing these mood swings and they aren't necessarily directed towards you. Pregnancy is uncomfortable and the symptoms can drive a woman nuts. I know, I'm 11 weeks pregnant and haven't slept a full night in weeks. Spend some more quality time with her and let her know how much you love her and support her. Also listen to what she has to say. You have to understand that right now she probably feels like a fat cow and she isn't feeling as sexy as she did before pregnancy. She is afraid of raising a child alone because of this un-sexy feeling. Let her know that you love her and her body. My husband gives me back rubs which make me feel very sexy even though I am bigger. You'll survive this. Think of your baby. Read What to Expect When Expecting, the men's chapter. Best of luck to you both.|`|O20eJDd4aa	Distraction!  Both for her and for you! See what you can do together that gives you sort of a break from the pregnancy blues. Get some comedy DVDs and have a good laugh together. Hormones are probably running havoc with your girlfriend state of mind and it will get better but it's not easy. For her (and you!), it's really important that she eats well and healthy, lots of fruits and veg and so on, it will help her mood too. Go easy on the sugar. Try to get out for some fresh air and light exercise.  Does she have any pregnant friends to confide in, and if so, can't you meet up with their partners? It will help to make sense of this weird and wonderful time.  And the more resourceful and resilient you are now together, the better you will deal with all the exciting things the baby will throw at you!  Hang in there, it sounds like you are doing pretty good at understanding and supporting your girlfriend.|`|44OH7Si6aa	When she gets crabby just ask her if she is having a bad day, offer to rub her feet or massage her back. Compliment her but try not to make it sexual. Don't say things like wow your **** are looking great now (my Friend said this to his wife while we were at a restaurant and she was a week past due with their son, she didn't like it too much) If you pamper her, she will feel more appreciated and be less likely to want to castrate you in your sleep.|`|p0prrzf2aa	just don't touch her. don't ask about sex. don't annoy her AT ALL. my husband does the same thing and f'n ay if i tell him to stop touchin me he gets mad. ha oh well|`|dPULl5hjaa	One day at a time - that's how you deal with it!  It will get better!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	Just remember that in a couple months, she'll have a little bundle of joy, which will make things tons better :]  and remember that you're not the one carrying around a lot of baggage, & that you're not the one that has to give birth..big head, little vagina=big pain.  and remember that in a couple months you'll only have to deal with her moodiness one week out of every month :]    it'll all be worth it, rest assured :]|`|o8xNTVWTaa	it will pass do exactly what ur doing grin and bear it hormones are nuts for her right now she probly feels like shes insane so u just have 2 remember what shes going through as well iam sure shes not loving being able to controll her emotions either congrats on the baby|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Give her whatever she wants, continue to tell her that she is beautiful at every available opportunity, bring her home some flowers and a card that says how much you love her and how happy you are that she is having your baby, and then do it all over again.  I know it sucks, but that's part of being pregnant.  She can't stay mad forever.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i'm 14 weeks pregnant and i'm the same way as your gf.    just put up with it, i know it's hard.    but think about the girl you loved BEFORE she was pregnant...it's just the hormones!|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Honestly, just smile and nod and take it.  Continue to express how sexy you think she is, even if she says "You're full of it".  Be there when she needs you there, but also make time for yourself.  When you do go out, though, make sure you check in; if she's letting her emotions tell her that you may cheat, then that will be enhanced if you don't check in regularly.    Her hormones may level off as she gets farther along, but they also may not.  So, just try your best to handle it.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	You have to just ignore it as someone else said.      Just pretend all is normal.    She's gonna flip out all the time and act pretty crazy so you'll be dealing with it for awhile.      I really dislike being pregnant.    But in the end the little babes are worth it...    Good luck

2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	You will have a great time!  At this age they are interested in everything and rarely stay upset for too long.      One of the easiest things to dowith him which will entertain him is take him around your home on a tour, point out pictures, colors, anything you can think of, at this aget they just love to look around.      Also try getting down on his level.  Being down on the floor with him gives you a birds eye view of what he sees.    One last thing, read with him.  He won't care what you read as long as it has pictures and your voice is soothing.  Let him flip through a magazine with you.|`|fLolZCXJaa	your brother in law will bring a diaper bag with some toys in it. you can put in cartoon movies or kids movies if u have any. cartoons on tv. a 1 year old is pretty easy to handle. they dont do much. they're curious so he'll wanna crawl around and you can just watch him play with toys and feed him or change a diaper. it'll b easy|`|Nn9t3DyYaa	im sure this wont be to hard it's easy to keep an one year old occupied and happy all at once make sure your brother in law brings some of his favorite toys over and you guys could watch cartoons maybe let him color or read a book or sing play peek a boo it's a number of things to do im sure you'll have fun dont worry|`|27d56c06ceccc45d5e89e737fce397ddaa	First off, ask the father what kinds of things work as distractions if he wont stop crying. I know if my child really wont stop, there's a few tv shows that I can turn on that always work. But tv doesnt work for every kid.  Secondly, 1 year olds are very easy to amuse.   Pull out some pots and pans to bang on.  Give him a wooden spoon to play with. Or an empty toilet paper roll to look through. Anything!|`|hgPmwYAfaa	smile clap and whisle...that should do it they're e-z..|`|cX9YYuh2aa	I agree with Jeanette.  At that age they just want to explore the environment.  Colorful pictures and soothing sounds work great.  Also just plain ol face to face attention.  It may take some time for him to warm up to you if you aren't all that familiar to him but he'll settle.  Have a great time.|`|f6b9d3cf1043594fe000c8acf71cf94caa	How about asking your brother-in-law??? I mean, if you feel that you are lost to what to do with the baby, the best person to ask is that child's parents. Children are people too; therefore, they have different personalities. My little girl when she was one, everybody could babysit her because she was so "easy" to deal with. She wasn't a cry baby. She liked music and snacks, and attention (like compliments- yea I know it's very Diva-like).    My son on the other hand is the exact opposite, only whining, and he likes T.V. we dont even watch television like that, and he likes to look at House. It's hilarious. He likes stories and he is a loner.    Point is tell your bro-in-law to bring over the child's fave things, like foods,  toys, and books. Ask him about things that tick off the child and what things that are sure to keep him content while you have him.  Ask him how his boy acts around other people, and what can you do to make the baby more comfortable around you. Try to spend a half hour with the boy before the father goes, to see how the baby reacts to your home. Just ask the parent it's the best way!!! Good luck and have fun.|`|145RUNQHaa	Kids this age are easily distracted he may cry when his dad leaves but take him to the window (not one where he can see his dad leaving) and show him the birds if you can see any!or anything along those lines just keep up animated chat all the time they love that.sing songs and can he walk?then you could dance too.one year old can be hard work but they are entertained with the simplest things but they are not keen on keeping still so all breakables and small objects they can choke on out of reach.just walk round with him talking and pointing at things around your house the two hours will fly by .....and then you ll be broody!
FdQD8H3qaa	Don't worry about when you started him on the cereal...  Where I'm from they say that you can start them on it at 6 weeks old...  I would start with a bit of the fruit or veggie and still have him eat the cereal  just be sure to only introduce one new food every few days so that you can see if he has any allergies... but that doesn't mean that you can only give him one thing for three days and then try something new... keep the ones that you know he can eat and add new ones on top of that...  Also then you can look into the blended foods like applesauce and pears together... if you know he is okay with the apples then it's really like only adding one new food, the pears.. so you know if he gets a rash that it's the pears not the apples.....   Also don't buy into the crap that you should start with veggies because if you go with fruit first they won't like the veggies... it's a load of crap! In fact sometimes it's better to start with fruit because it is sweeter and if you breast feed the milk is quite sweet.....   people told me that my son wouldn't eat his veggies if he had fruit first but that's crap because he eats everything and loves it.. also if they were that picky he wouldn't have been willing to nurse and have formula after eating food because formula is some really nasty stuff compared to real food!|`|3klIx1Egaa	no you use the same amount of fruits and veggies that you do with the cereal. and start with veggies first, because if he gets to used to the sweet you may have a problem getting him to eat the bitter tastes later. id suggest peas, squash, and carrots for veggies, bananas, apple sauce, and pears for fruits.
PFO1jxZGaa	try wholesale warehouses like sams club or costco ( in the US) or just walmart|`|iMULlxdgaa	well are they paying you for one? Its reasonable to tell them that you will charge because of the materials,  especially if they're not all best friends.  I wouldn't charge friedns or whatever but if its just some folks that know you from work...I would let them know the cost of making one of these cakes...hey it might actaully prove to be a bit profitable.  But even if you didn't want to make a profit you could tell them straight forward that its does cost money and if they give you the money for the amterials you'll make it free of charge.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Well I think if they want you to make these cakes, they should either pay you for it, or they should  go out and buy the baby stuff for it, like the diapers, rattles, toys, blankets and whatnot..it can get very costly buying these. But try Costco and Sam's Club for the bulk in Diapers, Micheal's for Clearance ribbons, flowers etc. or the fabric section at wal-mart. And sometimes you can find cute baby items for parties and such ot Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. But I would let these guys know, its not cheap to make these, and if they want it they have to chip in a bit.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think you should have a couple people pitch in and help with the cost cause so many people expecting that from you by yourself is a little selfish of them.     I found that Diapers at Sam's Club/Costco are actually more expensive for some reason. Walmart has cheaper diapers (think Pampers) Bring a calculator and do the math per diaper and you will see what I am talking about.     Good Luck, you sound nice, wish I had you as a friend!!|`|AA10079820	Sams.  Cosco.  Ebay.    You should be charging for these diaper cakes girl!|`|8IyZphFVaa	why wouldn't they offer to pay? they aren't stupid. its not like you have a whole bunch of friends getting pregnant all of a sudden. you can go to places like costco and bjs but you should really give them a price at least based on how much it costs for the stuff you need to make it. and you should think about making a business out of this. get some kind of protection from the recipe or idea being stolen.|`|uoKXojguaa	I Did the exact same thing .but its cool Now cuz we sale them to alot of ppl in our salons Our friends , Our friends friends & there family.........Yeah the word spreads like crazy   We get our stuff at costco & the 99 cent stores 7 dollar tree stores Believe it or not have really cute things when you really look Like i foung cute onsies & pajama set & bottles & bibs that all had the "Got Milk" logo & that was a big hit!!!  Im actually making one this weekend for a friend of mine & i already got some bibs & stuff from the dollar tree ..& Costco.....(not everything is cheap lol)|`|831a6993e071e4c9ca0bad41bfec877faa	Try Family Dollar, Big Lots, Dollar General. and depening where you live...Sams Club and dollars stores might have some cute stuff too. You can always find great baby stuff at the 1st three places. I use to have a day care and I swear by these stores! Good Luck!  Oh and you could also make sure you charge a little bit of moneys so your costs are covered!|`|5obUB1KIaa	In my opinion, to make it easier on yourself, I would make a check list of items needed to make a diaper cake and hand a sheet to each person that wants one made.  Have them buy the items themselves to bring to you.  You can charge them a fee for your time in making it.  Buying the items yourself is too costly and time consuming and sometimes people don't understand the costs and time involved.  By them getting the stuff themselves they are able to appreciate your diaper cake more.  If you must buy, then I suggest going to your local shops and looking through the clearance/bargain items to lower your costs.  For craft items try online stores such as www.michaels.com  or a good site I like is www.orientaltrading.com  Best of luck.
65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	If he is gaining weight it should be ok. My baby girl would go 4 or 5 hours sleeping when she was 2 weeks and she was still gaining wait and healthy.     He will let you know when he is hungry. You need your sleep too.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	depends on who u ask; u need to ask doc bc they know your baby and we don't; as well as they know the weight andhealth history of your baby...|`|wENdWT5kaa	Wait for him to wake up. I was told by a nurse it is ok for a newborn to miss a feeding.     My son, just last week actually missed 3 feedings. Slept right from 4pm (last bottle was at 3) and woke up at 3am. Hasn't done it since, so i'm not concern. Tho if a baby does that often, then there is reason for concern.     But one feeding. No need for concern. He'll wake up if he's hungry.|`|ccBNNA5paa	if he's hungry you'll know it!|`|KUxEBQuYaa	If he is sleeping let him sleep. hell wake when hes hungry. its fine. just as long as he is gaining weight.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	That's fine.  He's sleeping that long because he's satisfied.  Trust me...when he's hungry, he'll wake up.  As long as he's eating well while he's awake and gaining weight appropriately, there's nothing to worry about.|`|mn8tFuhoaa	well from what i know is that you shouldnt let the baby go longer than 5 hours for his feeding.. its okay but he shouldn't miss it..and it also depends how many ouncez you give the baby for his last feeding..|`|9WxIYtEfaa	No. My bro-in-law is a pediatric surgeon and he told me never to let your newborn go more than four hours without feeding. Their bodies can't handle being without the sugars and nutrients they need for that long yet.  They are not at the point when they can regulate it themselves. He graduated top of his med school class from a top 10 med school. He told me just to wake my baby up and feed him while my baby was a newborn.|`|D35SFHbTaa	That's perfectly okay. If he's hungry, he'll let you know. Take it as a blessing that he's sleeping for 5 hour stretches at night!|`|5xl2AFj4aa	I was the same way with my daughter when she was first born. Dont worry about it they will let you know when they are hungry. Enjoy the sleep as they get older they sleep more throw the night and my daughter is 5 months old now and she is fine she still wakes up at least 1 or 2 times to eat at night. When i got back from the hospital with her i was up every 2 hours waking her to feed her and i was told by my cousion that its fine to let them sleep and they will wke you when they are hungry.  As long as there is enough wet and messy dipars then dont worry about waking the baby to eat.
MzqZGvalaa	No sweetie you can't feel the baby move at six weeks, not even if there's 6 or 7 babies in there, so twins won't make a difference.  I don't want to patronise you, so don't think I'm treating you like an idiot okay?   The most common thing that is mistaken for early baby movements is bowel disturbances.  If it's bothering you, go and talk to a midwife, or ring a pregnancy info line on the 'phone.  Could you have your dates wrong?  It's not unheard of for women to have a couple of light periods early in the first trimester.  If your last period was a 'throw off' then you could even be up to 8 or 10 weeks further along than you think, in which case you would be able to feel the movements(usually about 16weeks)  I wouldn't worry too much, tell them when you go for your prenatal exams if it is still on your mind.  They'll give you an ultrasound test anyway, this will give you a fairly accurate idea of your dates.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	usually when you are having multiples you tend to be sicker|`|ddP3klT3aa	If you are 6 weeks, there is no way you can feel the baby move. Have you had an ultrasound? All pregnancies are different. You may be fine with one, and sick as even with another.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	You need to talk to the dr. You may be farther along, an ultrasound will tell better. Also every pregnancy is different. My first I was always sick always tired, my second I didn't even know I was pregnant until the day I miscarried.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	every pregnancy is different.|`|gga2mwFIaa	You need to get an ultrasound done because when I was pregnant with my daughter I didn't know I was even pregnant until I was 3 months along and with your second child you start feeling the fluttering a lot sooner. It could also just be gas that you are feeling but deffinatly go to the doctor so they can give you an exact date. And yes every pregnancy is different, its like night and day. I have been pregnant 3 times and they have all been completely different. Good Luck! I would also guess you are having a boy if you are showing so soon because most likely it means the baby is sitting very low. Its not a sure thing but it has held true with me and everyone of my friends.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	each pregnancy is different so you cant really compare this one to the first one. I had a little morning sickness with my first pregnancy but was completely functional and worked full time until I gave birth. This second time around I have been so unbearably sick that I couldnt function at all. I was pregnant with one girl the first time and this time I am also pregnant with one girl.|`|mbG4GbEUaa	I know how ya feel! My daughter was 9 mos. old when I got pregnant with my son. (they are 15 and 16 now). It may have been awhile ago but I remember it like yesterday. My first was relatively easy. Some morning sickness and being tired. Delivery was ok. At my daughter's first b-day I was 3 mos. preg. again. Ah, how did that happen?! Anyway, this was a difficult pregnancy. He layed transverse (sideways) the hole time and they had to manually turn him. I was sick and tired ALL the time. So, all pregnancies are different. See you Dr. asap. Good Luck!  ps. did you lose all your baby weight the last time? Maybe that's why you are heavier this time.|`|hamdnq5Yaa	You show faster on your second pregnancy. All your symptoms sound normal to me because I had all of what you had mention, just as bad.  The feeling of movement is most Likely just gas. I hope that you feel better soon. Crackers helped me with the nausea and it will get better in a few weeks. It may get to the point that you just cant take it any more and then its gone just like that.  Magic!!!
Ej2EOsvKaa	hi...THANKs for answering my question on my little boys name..lol  i will return the favor and answer this question also :0    ok...i am 19 and 21 weeks pregnant.

( i could have graduated this summer with my AA) but then i had to drop a class due to feeling sick and tired and all that goood stuff. so just know it takes determination. You can finish no matter how long it takes you...you have your supportive sister so you can do it!!    dont be scared of the weird symptoms..lol....start doing your research on symptoms and what to expect. lol      ok...there is sooo much i would love to share with you  but i really should start working (im on the clock right now..ahh)    so if you like..feel free to email me with any questions or add me as a contact. k ladies....    thanks for the names..i never EVEr thought of threee names...they were beautiful. :)      hope i helped..and if i didnt say this before    CONGRATS on the baby....:))|`|8ORxyeEuaa	well for one i am a teen parent...i have a one year old and i am 18...it was hard because i wasnt living with the father so he couldnt help through out the night but...it's wrth it...i love my baby boy...i was used to changing pampers cuz i was raised around kids all my life...but sometimes the baby will cry n u ave no idea y...u jus have 2 b patient...i hope the father is responsible and will help...me n him are engaged now so all will work out...if u want IM me:::::bonitanena215|`|7ZUObaYWaa	Im sorry to hear about you parents. Im 17 weeks pregnant and 18 years old. I think the hardest thing is for me is not doing everything all my friends can do like go to amusement parks or go to the pool this summer in a bikini also not going to any partys.  Just be there to support her any way you can through the whole pregnancy.|`|PdWm9atYaa	wow its going to be really hard and i don't want to be a downer but its true it hard on her and body and mentally big time!! take it from someone that know wow she will never be able to be like all the other girls but have in a baby is hard and u are in a ruff place for so many reasons. wow it has to be hard but its about to get harder for you and her siblings. but she has to understand it going to change her life. her body will never be the same it going to make what she want in life 3x harder but she 16 and not going to Liston Prolly ididn'tt lol but all you can do is support herthat'ss all up can do right now.. but good luck!!|`|Ol2S1ZiMaa	I would just make sure she's taking care of the baby. Not smoking, drinking, taking her prenatal vitamins, and going to all of her doctor appointments.     Good luck!
giKCTfnfaa	kind of ungrateful huh?  doesn't sound like your dad is really bothering you.  you could just tell him, but remember, what comes around, goes around.  when you're sick or need someone to watch your child, don't be suprised if they tell you they don't want to be bothered.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	That's kind of messed up. He's your dad and who cares if he wants to use the computer a whole 2 times a week!! And I got news for you, you are gong to get a lot more visits when the baby comes. Chill out. A day will arrive when you will be so thankful to live next door to your folks.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	could u come by later   right now isnt a good time  i need a little heads up when ur coming   buy him a computer lol   i have alot to do and all this coming over when ever u need things really isnt working for me   i was thinking since the baby will be hear soon and things in the house  will be different when he or she is home calling b4 u come would be better   congrats on the baby hope u have a quick and safe delivery|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Tell him that you are really tired and that you need to rest up that the pregnancy is draining you.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	just tell him " dad i am very grouchy these days and this computer thing is really annoying me, its nothing personal but if you are not here to visit with me then i need a break."  or how about a time limit? "dad i dont mind if you want to use the computer but i am tired in the afternnon adn need to take a nap so can we set a 1/2 hour time limit for now and when the baby comes"  You have a right to your space but i have to say that if you arent really fond of your parents, you may want to think about relocating.|`|d67ULZQ6aa	Like someone else said, that's really messed up. He is your own dad, you should be thankful you get to see him instead of complain about it. There are plenty of people out here that don't know their dad, or never get to see him. And your complaining about him using your computer. If it really bothers you so much just tell him, your his daugher, you should at least be honest with him.    Now if you want my sneaky, dirty answer... just tell him that the internet is down and you can't figure out whats wrong.
2A6xFP81aa	I think it's really whack|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I am an adoptee and I have 2 adopted children.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with this-as a matter of fact a parent who has been adopted can actually help with the issues that may come up with their adopted kids.  If I had not had a very positive adoption experience it probably would not have been an easy decision.  But I think it is great.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I've got no problem with it at all.  I was adopted myself and my wife and I have adopted twice thus far.|`|vwTyihvvaa	I have no problem with it at all.    I am an adoptee and I plan to adopt.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	I am not adopted, but my mother did adopt three children, and if any of them wanted to adopt, I'd say go for it. It's a wonderful thing when an adopted child has such a wonderful upbringing with their adopted family that they wish to share that love. Natural mothers adopting...well, so long as they are prepared for it, I don't see why not. Just because circumstances prevented you from keeping your biological child does not mean those circumstances are now in place now. In your case, make sure your son understands that while you love him, you couldn't keep him, but now you are capable of taking care of a child and have decided to give another child what you were not able to give him.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	I would enter into a legalized guardianship situation but cannot see myself adopting.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I just gave birth to my own daughter 3 weeks ago.    We talked about if we would want more children later..  at the moment, Im satisfied with one..  however, if we decided that we wanted more children, I would be more open to adoption instead of having more of our own.   I'd prefer to adopt a young school-age child instead of dealing with all the baby stuff.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Things in life change, and hopefully, we all become better people when we get older, as well as wiser.  I think that overall, you might be 1000% better adoptive parent, because you realize some of the losses and differences of adoption.  Circumstances change, and past experiences make us stronger, and better to cope with future issues.    I think it's great that you're in reunion, and that your son is supportive in your going ahead and adopting.  I wish you luck, and moral support!|`|RrgQUT5vaa	My adopted daughter dreams of adopting one day.  She wants to adopt foster children.  I think that it would be very empowering for her.|`|HmkCFddAaa	As an adoptee I think adoption is great, and have no problem with it.  I think it's great when an adoptee adopts. My bio mother didn't adopt (that I know of) but she went on to remarry and have more children of her own. I am very happy for her that she was able to rebuild her life and I wish her nothing but the best.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I am against anyone adopting, unless it is from foster care. As an adoptee, I could never adopt. Not only am I morally opposed to infant adoption, I feel I would not be a good parent to an adopted child, as I think I would try to re-parent myself.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	I think as long as you want to be parents and are emotionally secure with a strong sense of self (in spite of the obvious trauma of losing your son), then I think you are ready to be an adoptive parent.     I wish you the best of luck.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	I would never adopt privately or from an agency....that is just perpetuating the corruption of infant adoption.    For a child in foster care, or a true orphan, I would prefer permanent guardianship and maintaining some type of connection to the bio-family.  Adoption would require the falsification of the birth certificate, which I am completely opposed to.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	At the end of the day it's your families choice,.     If you feel you can adopt after your own experiences they its no ones place to make up your mind for you, or judge you for it.    You have a lot to offer these kids, and between you and your son. I still recommend you do some reading on being an adoptive parent, its different end of the playing field, and its good to have the preparation for whats ahead of you and your family.    All the best!|`|LgMoGUoqaa	There certainly isn't anything wrong with you adopting.  I don't see a problem with it.|`|XW2Bvwfcaa	Good for you!  But at the same time, you don't sound excited.  Make sure you have the right reasons for adopting, which may take waiting for the right time to make sure you are not trying to fill a void.    God bless!|`|fPFXJr3eaa	As I have suffered from the results of adoption, I would NEVER want to adopt or put another person in the position I have been in.    My husband and I plan to be foster carers sometime soon once we have figured out where we are going to live long term.  But I could never adopt.  There has already been too much pain and anguish caused by adoption and I will not add to it.
u9sGH0AXaa	You pay for your parents to babysit?  If you are paying for your parents to babysit anyway...why don't you hire a babysitter?  You can do several interviews and maybe have a supervised day of babysitting until you can trust someone else.  Your parents are not ALWAYS going to be there, you need to be able to trust someone else.  You need to decide whether hurting your FIL feelings a little is worth the risk of SIDS or breathing problems as your precious Peyton grows up.|`|70kh6VSoaa	have you told them to stop?|`|S3DFPmjaaa	You obviously can't control how your FIL behaves,  or know whether or not he understands the risks of passive smoking. But you can't put a price on your baby's health.  Find someone else to care for your precious child and don't compromise her health.|`|1V6gDSjaaa	What is more important - your babies health or having a baby sitter albeit an ignorant one.  Everyone knows the potential health risks of smoking around a new born baby whatever language you speak.  I would seriously consider finding another babysitter who has consideration for the baby and its parents wishes.  If your babysitter can be so blaze over smoking what else will they be allowing your baby to do, play with matches !!!!  Ask yourself  'what's next' ?|`|64tdPWLGaa	I read an answer you posted for someone else where you said you and your husband make $10,000 a month! Why dont you hire a nanny!!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Bottom line-Grandpa isn't going to stop smoking for his grandchild, son or you so suck it up and find another child care provider for your little one.
eRlNQxbNaa	It might be the baby's head exerting more pressure down there.  The last few weeks of my pregnancy I could barely walk because it felt like my son's head was already in my vagina-it hurt sooooo bad.    I'm kind of surprised you go this long between dr. visits at 37 weeks! They had me coming in every week for the last seven weeks or so.    Good luck!|`|Q0i7iMmRaa	Dont worry until it comes and goes 3 to 5 mins apart!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	yup..its very normal....it will only get worse...sorry to say...its probaly pressure from babes head or your cervix changing...but its completly normal...goodluck you dont have too much longer!!
C2sZREuAaa	Take the memory disk out of the camera.   When she finds out that the disk is not there she will be worried.    Then calmly sit with her.  Tell her you saw her pictures of her body.   Ask her is she is curious about her body parts being a women or she showing them to other people.    If she is showing them to other people.  Kindly say... I am concerned that people will do horrible things to you in the future.  (rape & kidnapping)    If she is just curious about her body parts then tell her maybe its time to see gynecologist or psychologist.|`|0rpN2419aa	A child this young is curious, but it has gone way to far.  I would be very concerned of the possibility that she has been sexually molested to make her even think of wanting to take pictures like this.  Maybe you could tell her you borrowed her camera to take pictures of the snow and that you saw the pictures.  Do not speak to her in an angry, confrontational way, or she might start rebelling and things will get worse with the mother daughter relationship. I know I would be shocked too.  Yikes!|`|838VJJGvaa	Teen girls are curious about sex I have to admit.  You need to talk to her about sex and porn and other stuff like that.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	Oh my god.  I don't even know.  She is a teenager, so she wants to have fun,but you HAVE to talk to her about this.  That is NASTY!    Just talk to her, tell her it is not innaproriate.  Try to make it EMBARESSING, by talking to both of the girls at once, trust me- they will be sooo embaressed that they will NEVER EVER do it again!|`|OsHjXzxUaa	im sure ur mind is SCRAMBLING... but at that age their just expiramenting. if ur going to confront her, DO NOT make her feel like ur attacking her by any means, if u do she'll immediatly close up and start yelling at u... just bring pu how u uploaded the pics and saw something on there u wud like to talk about it with her. even if u have to jsut start it by saying u know people her age expirament and see where she takes it.... hopefully that was of any help :) and good luck with the situation|`|1s3nddaYaa	well, at least if she is having sex with a girl, she cant get prego? or maybe they are taking them for a guy. umm not really sure what to tell you. just take it away for a while, and if she gets mad tell her you bought it and not to take naked pictures of people.    edit. and people are so mean to put a thumbs down, people come for advise people have different advice, sure the ones that are smart asses, but for some of the people that are giving their honest opinion, thats just wrong|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	Maybe you should ask before using your daughters things...you bought it for her right?     Maybe you should have "the talk" with her about sex, safety, pregnancy, STD's, appropriate choices and behavior, etc.    Who was taking the pictures...maybe that should be your concern?    If she is only 9 you should definitely sit her down and talk to her, AND FIND OUT WHO WAS TAKING THE PICS! Not for punishment, but again...appropriate, safe behavior, exploring sexuality, and let her know she can talk to you. Ten months ago she didn't know how to tell you she had gotten her period!    Good luck!|`|yZX1wpUJaa	Whatever you do now is not going to stop her from doing what she wants. You might want to bring it up to her or maybe just forget about it. Whatever it is it's too late and a lot of teens unfortunately do this wierd sutff. It's crazy|`|prqrQcd1aa	I would simply tell her what happened, and ask her what she was doing taking nude photos for... this may be just a "teenage" thing but still you need to discuss it with her. if you haven't had the sex talk already..now would be a great time to do so!  I wouldn't worry about her being a lesbian... and honestly it's not uncommon for girls to "compare" private parts. They are young and curious.|`|u4FGBKi4aa	Approach her about it....|`|57fZyjvgaa	This really depends on the age of your daughter.  No matter how old, do NOT punish her. Do not shame her. Sexuality is something all children explore in different ways and parents should not make them feel ashamed of it - but parents SHOULD guide them and tell them when something is inappropriate.   You can explain to her that it is not appropriate to take pictures/look at pictures in a non-educational setting.   Please don't talk to her in front of her friend - this would probably just mortify her.  Have a conversation with her - instead of lecturing, ask her WHY she feels the need to do this and talk to her about it.|`|r18PoGJiaa	OMG. Why did I read this right after eating my dinner?|`|1hS1pQz5aa	I know it may freak you out, but your daughter may be a Lesbian. If she is, she may be too scared to talk to you about it.   Talk to her privately, and tell her that no matter what she does, or becomes, that you will always love her.   If she knows you won't criticize her, or tell her it's wrong to like the same gender, then she'll be more likely to open up.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	at 10 I think she is just curious about her body, I would talk to her about it though, about private areas and sex and everything that goes along with it. Dont be too hard or judgemental either .and keep an eye on her too :) I dont think she needs to be punished but you do need to make sure why she is taking these pics, if she is sendig them to someone or posting them or anything like that... But most likely she is just trying to figure out what goes on 'down there'|`|pd6udbvbaa	uh oh    i think punishment is what ur looking for|`|qgmfazqEaa	see a counsler and confront her about it...ask her how to communicate with your daughter, and maybe your daughter can eventually see her as well|`|mzNAeS6Baa	how old is your daughter?|`|hlztyMYyaa	depending on how old she is let her be who she is tell her you found the pics and its ok|`|h06mx3d8aa	that is really disturbing... u should just talk to her privately about it.|`|d6nyFSW6aa	Sit her down and tell her that you found some pictures. Tell her you understand if it's some "teenage phase" she's going through so then maybe she will open up about it. But that is quite strange..|`|f8b0aaad8207d631cdc448f606b81a58aa	How old is your daughter first of all? I think if you approach it at all you are going to have a fight on your hands. It is her property and you took it. She wouldn't just leave a camera that she KNEW had those pictures on it laying around. So did you go into her room and get it? If so you know she is not going to like that at all. I say just let it go. I mean don't embarras her. She probably is already embarrased that she is a lesbian ( if that is the case).    EDIT: 10!!! Wow okay then she is still a baby! You need to talk to her about this. Just sit down with her in her room and bring it up. I was guessing she was like 16. You definitely need to talk with her. I guess you should probably keep a closer eye on her now too. Taking pictures of herself is probably not the only thing she is up to.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	You didn't say what age she is.  Could be some teenagers just goofing off and trying to be funny.  Don't worry about it and keep an eye for anything else that doesn't seem normal for kids her age.      I just learned that your daughter is 10 and I still think they were  playing with the camera and not realizing where the pictures would go, etc.  At age 10, the curiosity is still there but maybe more of doing things to be funny. I really don't believe this was a lesbian act.  Watch her and monitor the camera and computer and also the two girls when they are together.|`|6vryp5a3aa	If she's lesbian, she's probably too scared to tell you. It would be an embarrassing subject & depending on how close you guys are - it may not be best to bring it up. Maybe you should bring it up, maybe you shouldn't. Wait for her to tell you her preference.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	maybe she is a lesbian...   anyways, i don't think you should worry so much about the pictures, but more about what she is doing behind closed doors. you need to talk to her about her sex life... she probably wont open up to you.... but you should let her know about HIV and aids.... at least you don't have to worry about her getting pregnant if she is a lesbian... but anyways... good luck....|`|QzlFON84aa	Don't assume the worst talk to her calmly and tell her what you saw. Hopefully she will give you an explanation. and the conversation will go from there. I Hope everything goes ok with u and ur daughter.|`|VERrlErvaa	As a parent, that would be pretty shocking to discover.  I think I would have had a heart-attack.      This is something you're going to have to deal with; but you have to make sure you do it in a manner that isn't confrontational.  You have not said how old your daughter is - or what kind of relationship you have with her - i.e.: Good/fair/bad    The problem is, nowadays, many tv shows promote this stupid "girl-on-girl" rubbish and it is creating a lot of trouble.  I think you need to sit down with your daughter - just the two of you and calmly discuss it.     There is no point going off, yelling and demanding who's to blame.  Just find out what the story is and tell her how you feel about it and ask her why she feels she can't talk to you about how she is feeling.    In the meantime, if you do find out that the girl that comes over is involved, I would make an attempt to contact her parents and let them know what is going on.  The last thing you need is for either of those girls to get those images out onto the internet.  Once they are out, they can't get them back.  Also, I would be wary of who she chats with on the internet.  There could be someone "grooming" her through a chat room and inciting them to do it.    I never let my kids use the internet without knowing what they're doing and who they're talking to.  It's just a house rule - but it stops them being harrassed by unsavoury types.    Good luck.|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	First off how old is your daughter? Who is this other girl and how close are they? I think that it is very immature of them to be taking pictures of something so Personal. But it might be some kind of a way to express their sexuality.   Yes it is very much disturbing to see but if I was you i would find out more about her friend, how close they are if she has a B/F you know and then slowly ease into that you saw the pictures and that  your concerned.  She's 10???? WOW|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Hmmm.    What doesn't make sense here?    I know, you have one daughter, and she has only one girlfriend over, but the pictures are of two girl's reproductive bits.     Just how long are her arms? You aren't a gorilla family are you?    You seem to be trolling...|`|aGiLZ6hJaa	omfgg,  wow  im 14 ... so im close to her age.  I would NEVER do anytthinggg like that..its gross.  you shouldnt confront her...if my mom would i would be embarrased.  just go one day and sit with her and tell her  "Lets look at the pics in your camera"  and when you get to 'the pics' then see her REACTION and talk to her about it.  you should listen to me cuz im like close to her age and i know which way i would want MY mom to talk to me if i would ever do such a thing..  So thats what i reccomend.|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	i would take the memory card if i were you.|`|j9SP0xLcaa	woh...    i cant give answer, but, woh.|`|EZ0UyjVAaa	You should talk to her but be careful and make sure she doesn't know that you saw the pics until you know the full story|`|IeJhZL87aa	wow a lot of these peoples answers really arent helpful.    I think you need to confront her about what she was going to do with the pictures. As for the fact of what it is....I wouldnt worry. Young girls are curious and often times compare each others body parts with one another. I know I used to do it.  As long as teh pictures werent going up on the internet, or passed aorund school...then I wouldnt worry about the rest.|`|Rvp2VBjKaa	how old is your daughter?  even though i am only young,i have a daughter myself & if i found pics like that i'd want to know what she intended to do with them & who took them.  you have to be careful about how you approach the subject,as she might see it as you snooping through her things.  if she is underage i would definatly confront her,as it is very worrying about what she needs the pictures for.  maybe look into who she hangs out with to make sure she isn't being influenced by any older guys|`|mGDlEtsTaa	I'd say not to make any assumptions and to let it go on at her own pace.  If you intervene, she'll think you're snooping through her things, she'll possibly shut you out of the mainstream of things going on with her life and it'll all go downhill from there.  If it's what it looks like, she'll say what needs to be said when the time is right to HER.  I'd severely suggest not bringing up the matter and just function as normally as possible.  It might all be a misunderstanding in the long run.|`|XkE36LDgaa	Talk to her and her friend and if need be; her friends mom/guardian.  Maybe ask why she did it (even though its not an excuse) because there's a chance it was for a boy if she's in the teen years.    If not for a boy maybe she and her friend were just being stupid or thought it was 'funny' or something.    At any point you need to talk and make sure she knows the seriousness of what she did and find out what she was going to do with the pics.     I also suggest taking the camera and possibly looking in her cell phone (if it takes pics/videos) and if she has a computer or files on it.    It may be intrusive but better you find and delete it all then someone else and keeping it.|`|LazdTngJaa	Well, i would be concerned. teens are curious. i would defiantly ask about these photos. well at the age if ten she probably shouldn't be doing things like this. i would defiantly talk to her about this. Also, i would pay attention to who she is hannging out with.|`|JmRQfo1zaa	Wow, everyone is so afraid of homosexuality and other not so normal stuff. And conveniently, everyone who answered so far has been voted down once so far. Hmm, seems like you don't like anyone's answers so I don't know why you bothered.   How about, this is what teens and even younger kids do. Kids can't talk about sex with anyone because they get reprimanded and accused of acting it out, so they do things with their friends. Those of you who put parental locks on internet searches don't help. Where are they supposed to learn? Or get their fix? You want them to watch some porn or go out and do the real thing? She's probably perfectly normal.  Also you are a grown woman and you are still uncomfortable with breasts and other private areas? You seem it based on how you worded your question. You need to grow up or else you are going to raise a mentally screwed up person. If you really want to ask about it don't accuse (and don't punish, no one was harmed!) and be ready to accept having a lesbian daughter. Either way you can explain why she shouldn't do this with friends because it is a private matter, and if it keeps happening you can start worrying/punishing.
AA10624857	I am mom to 4 who were all born past their due dates by 9 days, 11 days, 5 days and 7 days. My older 3 were born long enough ago that inductions were rarely done and only when medically necessary. 40 weeks is average human gestation, but full-term babies can be born any time between 38-42 weeks with no problems. I was 38 years old and had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th pregnancy. I was considered high risk and my team of doctors discussed induction with me. I expressed my intent to let nature take it's course unless there was some medical reason to not. I was managing my blood glucose numbers with diet and glucose monitoring plus my baby was doing well as evidenced by weekly non-stress tests and ultrasounds. They agreed there was no medical reason to induce, but simply a precaution. At 41 weeks I showed no signs of impending labor. I had not effaced or dilated nor had I been having much in the way of Braxton Hicks contractions. We discussed having a prostoglandin gel insertion, which I reluctantly agreed to since it's purpose was to hopefully convince my cervix to think about thinning and softening. I ended up having a bad reaction to the gel and began having 6 minute contractions which sent my baby into distress with alarmingly low heart rates in the 40's and 50's! I did not try Black and Blue Cohosh, but I did try lots of other Old Wives' Tales to help start labor. Nothing I did made my labors start any sooner. I think if you've done the research and feel confident in taking the Black and Blue Cohosh there isn't any reason not to do so. However, I also think you should consider refusing induction unless there is some medical reason to do so. It is generally considered that there is no risk of deteriorating placenta until after 42 weeks. You can refuse the induction, especially if you haven't gone to 42 weeks yet. Some women can even go to 43 weeks with no signs of deteriorating placenta. For the record, I tried walking for miles, having a lot of sex, doing nipple stimulation, eating spicy foods, doing squats, walking up and down stairs, driving down bumpy back roads, and scrubbing floors on my hands and knees. I also had several membrane sweeps. Nothing I did made my babies come any sooner. Personally, I feel that a woman's body was uniquely designed to carry, labor, and deliver a baby. Unless there are medical reasons to interfere, I think that letting nature take it's course, even if it's not on our time schedule, is the best course of action.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Generally you wont be taking black and blue cohosh long enough to experience any side effects. Herbalists agree that these herbs are safe to take at 40 weeks gestation and will not harm your baby. There have been some concerns that blue cohosh could cause heart problems in a baby when used during pregnancy, however this was one isolated incident and there is no evidence that it was the blue cohosh that caused the problem.|`|AA11348933	I don't have anything against blue or black cohosh.  Just make sure that you are taking appropriate doses.      I don't see how you could let nature take its course and end up with a medical induction.  That is a contradiction in terms.  If you don't want an induction don't show up for the scheduled induction.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Don't you think it would be a good idea to ask your doctor their opinion about this? Funny how women take all their MD's advice to heart for 9 long months, but when it comes to self-inducing labor with herbs or other medications not created for that purpose, nobody bothers to tell their doctor or ask their doctor if they think it's safe or how much to take safely.    So if you haven't done so already, please do.|`|dq04utMoaa	I took black cohosh I believe when I was pregnant with my son. However I was 39.3 weeks pregnant and was so over being pregnant.. I had already tried to get induced (didn't work) and so I started taking this it worked ... so please hon be careful and research it all.. GL

AOvtRBU9aa	Stay away from spicy foods. Spicy food is the only thing that bothered my baby. I've heard people say milk has cause their baby problems if the baby is lactose intolerant. Just eat lots of vegables, fruits, lke you would when you were pregnant and make sure to keep taking your prenatal vitamin.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	soft boiled eggs or partly cooked eggs; mayonnaise made with fresh eggs; partly cooked meats; cream cheese; food that's been left uncovered; unwashed fruit and veg; and nuts|`|wiAVa1H5aa	No, not really - just avoid drugs like alcohol or sedatives that's all.  Yes they may not like the flavors but it introduces them to the foods available and perhaps preps their tastes towards healthy foods, and there is some evidence it also primes the immune system to not become allergic to foods via mother's milk.   In general there is no evidence that avoiding a potential allergen helps the infant's immune system in any manner.   Although most moms report that broccoli or other cruciferous vegetables make for a gassy baby.|`|MQ34YW28aa	you can eat pretty much anything. You probably want to stay away from spicey foods and a lot of dairy isn't good either if your little ones tummy gets upset easily. Just make sure you eat extra calories and lots of protein. Still take your prenatal vitamins.|`|u12eVaDhaa	Every woman and baby is different.  Breastfed babies don't really get significant difficulties from foods in milk.  You can really just continue to eat your normal diet because every flavour you ate in pregnancy passed into your baby's amniotic fluid which they taste when in the uterus.    Best wishes|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	The rules about what foods will make the baby sick are endless, and based in myth.  Cultures that eat these foods often don't even have a word for colic, their babies rarely cry.    High fiber foods such as broccoli are commonly said to cause gas in the baby, this is not possible.  Fiber, by definition, doesn't leave the digestive tract.  So while it does cause gas in mom it can't cause gas in baby.    Acidic foods such as oranges are said to cause stomach pain in the baby.  The pH of breastmilk does not change.  Eating acidic foods will not make your milk acidic.    Spices are said to upset baby, particularly garlic.  However double blind studies show that babies drink MORE milk when mom eats garlic.  Some babies dislike the smell or taste of spices in mom's milk, but it doesn't actually upset their stomach.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...  Is there a list of foods that I should avoid while breastfeeding?    There are NO foods that a mother should avoid simply because she is breastfeeding. It is generally recommended that you eat whatever you like, whenever you like, in the amounts that you like and continue to do this unless you notice an obvious reaction in your baby to a particular food. There is no such thing as a "LIST OF FOODS THAT BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS SHOULD NOT EAT" because most nursing moms can eat anything they want, and because the babies who are sensitive to certain foods are each unique - what bothers one may not bother another. If you have a family history of allergies, you might want to avoid certain foods (for example, peanuts or dairy), but again, this would be different for every child.  More information:    How does mom's diet affect her milk?    My baby is gassy. Is this caused by something in my diet?       Can nursing mothers eat strong-flavored or spicy foods?    Yes, in general. There are many cultures who regularly eat spicy foods and strong-flavored foods, and there is no evidence that a greater percentage of these babies are fussy, gassy, or have other problems with the foods their moms eat. We do know that some strong flavors, like garlic, can pass into the milk but it does not seem to cause problems. In fact, one study showed that babies nursed better after mom ate garlic.  Related information:    Do you need to avoid garlic or spicy foods? by Debbi Donovan, IBCLC    How will eating "gassy foods" affect baby?    It is common for nursing moms to be warned away from eating the so-called "gassy foods" such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, etc. However, gassy foods have no more potential to affect your baby than other foods.    Eating certain foods may cause gas in mom due to the normal breakdown of some of the undigested carbohydrates (sugar, starches, soluble fiber) by bacteria in the large intestine (see Gas in the digestive tract).    However, breastmilk is made from what passes into mom's blood, not what is in her stomach or digestive track. Neither the gas nor the undigested carbohydrates (whose breakdown can cause gas in mom) pass into mom's blood, so it is impossible for these things to pass into your milk to make your baby gassy.    This is not saying that your baby will not have a sensitivity to a certain food, but a food's potential to affect baby really has nothing to do with whether it makes mom gassy.    See also My baby is gassy. Is this caused by something in my diet? @    Can acidic foods that mom eats be "too acid" for baby?    No. Acidic foods like citrus, tomatoes, etc. can not change the acidity of breastmilk.       Will too many sweets or increasing/decreasing fat in my diet affect breastmilk?    No. Breastmilk is not affected by the amount of sugar that mom eats.    In addition, the fat and calorie content of mom's milk is not affected by her diet. However, the kinds of fats in the milk can be changed (to a certain extent) via diet.|`|TlbGt24Jaa	milk!!!...idk

Actually, we've always tried to keep her up after her last nap in the late afternoon.

Although he protested going in the crib the first few nights, quite quickly he started sleeping through from about 8pm-6am.  In the end I think it was 2 things: 1) he was old enough to understand when I told him he would get through and I loved him and he had to sleep in a crib now, and 2) I think he needed his own space.  Maybe sleeping with me was starting to crowd him too much and wake him up.

My husband and I have been TTC for 2 years and just started Clomid 100mg days 3-7 this month.  We've found nothing wrong with either of us, so we'll see if it works.  It seems like this cycle is taking sooooo much longer than the others though!  What's your story?|`|3MDY29gnaa	good luck to you both!! i dont take Clomid but i wish the best for the both of u (you and the lady above me)  God Bless
m5N8Ur6Daa	It is best to wait until you were supposed to get your period. Think back to when your last period started and wait until around that day (I know that waiting sucks!!!) The reason it is good to wait is cause if you take one and it's negative, it's possible that you took it too soon and the pregnancy hormone just hasn't had enough time to build up in your system. The closer you are to your period the more accurate a reading you are going to get. Also, if you wait until your period and you DO get your period, you save the money on the test. (I got mine the day after I dropped thirty bucks on a pregnancy test.) CVS has CVS brand early pregnancy tests for less than $20. I wouldn't get one for $1 because the quality might be compromised.    Otherwise, go to a planned parenthood center in your area and they can do a blood test which is more accurate.     GOOD LUCK!!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Honestly the more expensive the sooner those pregnancy tests seem to be able to tell you.  You can get a pregnancy test for less than $4 at WalMart or even less at the Dollar Store.  I bought one at WalMart and it didn't show positive until eleven days after I was supposed to start my period.  Also make sure to take it in the morning 1st thing if possible.|`|wtjbiRSbaa	your dying to know? how about not having sex unprotected when your 16. or not at all.|`|4g4RkSPmaa	I would wait at least 5 days past your last period.    And you can go to Dollar Tree and get a test for a dollar.  Or go to Walmart and get the equate test.
AA10953999	It sounds like Harry is jealous of your relationship with Scott. He may secretly like you or he may be jealous of all the time you and his brother spent together. IMO Harry is acting like an immature turd, he may have even told lies about you for his mother to turn on you like that. Harry is not acting like a true friend, maybe you should talk to him about his behavior.|`|MSngi4wHaa	to me i think maybe the mum thought u and harry had a thing on n that u were dumping him for scott, did she really know u were just friends and more importantly is harry clear that u r just friends, i think its really out of order that harry cud make u choose what kind of friend does that to you, id pic scott n tell em all where to go. i know friends come b4 boyfriends but if ur friend is wanting u to b miserable then he obviously dont care how u feel.   good luck anyway!!!
KUxEBQuYaa	the cold could be from her teething. my son is 7 months old and has been teething for 2 months. when he gets bad, his nose runs and he gets a slight fever. I make sure to give him the Orajel and some Tylenol when he needs it.   do you have any teething rings? i give my son them. but i dont put them in the freeze. he doesn't like them cold.   keep up your great work!|`|5SR5Hyfeaa	Cant tell about the cold from here :) but you can put a spoon in the freezer for a few min, then rub it on the teeth that are trying to come in. This will help break the skin holding the tooth down and really give the child  some relief .    jp|`|KAwHCSW4aa	I was babysitting today, and the mom has a little teething gum massager. It looks kind of like a baby toothbrush, but with little rubber bumps on the end. They come in a few different styles. Try putting some orajel on her gums if you haven't already; it tastes bad, but it's better than pain. Put her a her swing or a bouncy seat, that might take her mind off the pain. Keep her occupied with the bottle or a pacifier. I used to get VERY red cheeks, and a runny nose when I was teething (my mom said). The coughing is probably because she has been crying so much, and her runny nose is also a culprit; mucus in her throat. Good luck to you and your baby!|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	my kids never got sick from teething so i think she may just have a cold and be teething at the same time...i gave my kids tylenol or teething tablets

3RJUFbQ0aa	I have been pregnant 3 times and I hate to say it but it sounds to me like you have the early symptoms. For me I get so tired I can barely keep my eyes open and my breasts are tingly and tender. They never feel like that before my period so that is a sure sign for me. I also go to the bathroom more often then usual but not very much.    The only way to know for sure is to go and get a blood test from your doc. The home pregnancy tests never show up positive for me.|`|b72s4qH1aa	u need 2 wait untill ur late then take a test....and just 2 let u know when u are pregnant u dont start going 2 the loo alot more untill ur at least 4-5 months gone as the baby lies on ur bladder plus a get sore boobs on every period so it doesnt mean ur pregnant.|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Get on birth control.  There are enough teenage moms out there and while having a baby young may seem very romantic, let me tell you... It's a lot of HARD WORK, not to mention expensive.  You are too young!    The first sign for me was very sore boobs.  Other than that I felt like my period was coming-I had cramps and wanted to eat chocolate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Having to pee frequently and morning sickness didn't set in until about three or four weeks into the pregnancy.    Please, be a little more responsible next time.|`|AA11763588	There aren't any true early signs. The first one is to miss your period. When a woman wants to be pregnant or thinks she is, she will tend to find things that are there, that really aren't.    Just so you know, frequent urination is not an early sign, that happens later on.     And most symptoms start at 4 weeks, which is when you'd miss your period.|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Miss ur period hum duhhhh (U)    If u r not pregnant I hope u learnd ur lesson and use protection next time :-]|`|UX3xjsFlaa	No period, sore boobs, nausea (feeling sick all the time), feeling tired, body aches.|`|HXPxKEDQaa	those all sound like possibilities but theres nothing much you can do... just gotta wait out! wait till you have a missed period then test, and if u are pregnant i hope you dont consider abortion! there are plenty of loving couples who would love to be a family someday.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	If your period is due in 2 weeks most likely you would not have any signs of pregnancy yet.  My boobs usually get sore about a week or 2 before my period starts, so that's probably all that is going on.  Did you use the pull out method?  Well it's not 100%, but I think you are safe for now.  If your period does not start on time, then take a test.  When I found out I was pregnant my boobs were sore, but it started after my missed period.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	My first sign was that I was due for my period and instead of a full one I had a little spotting once a day for 5 days. I didnt get sore/tired/morning sick until weeks later.
2Pp2cDbJaa	im 17 and my b/f is 20 16 and 19 is no big deal, I am also pregnant about 6 weeks along. First you need to get on some prenatial vitimins, go to you ob/gyn and get some they will do a pregnancy test for you as well    Implantation Bleeding:  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping.     Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.    Free Medicaid Application Assistance    Delay/Difference in Menstruation:  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.    Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.    Swollen/Tender Breasts:  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen.     Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.    Fatigue/Tiredness:  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception.     Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.    Nausea/Morning Sickness:  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.    Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.    Backaches:  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.    Headaches:  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.    Frequent Urination:  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom.     Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.    Darkening of Areolas:  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker.     Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.    Food Cravings:  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.    you start to get symtoms around 6-8 weeks along sometimes sooner sometimes later, I started geting symptoms around 5 weeks    congrats !!! =)|`|A0NfgNEiaa	how dare u say that  windmill jouster.  IT ISNT WRONG TO HAVE A BABY YOUNG U NO. god people like u really piss me off.      I am 20 and i have a 8 month old little girl and she was the best thing that ever happened to me yes its hard but the gd things are priceless    The only advice i can give u is relax and sit down as much as u can when u feel like u need to in pregnancy u need to listen to wat ur body is telling u.    good luck and dont listen to little shits who moan about it,|`|NCvX4I0baa	16 and 19? If you are pregant I'm not sure if that's even legal.     The first sign would probably a positive pregnancy test a week after your period was suppose to come. Morning sickness comes a little later and little things come in the first 3 months. As long as you are eatting well, not stressing and taking good care of yourself (not smoking,drinking,partying etc.) you should be okay. The doctor who you go to for check ups during pregnancy known as prenatal care will keep track of your pregnancy so don't worry.|`|HOdblqIkaa	morning sickness  sore breasts  tired more  aches   having to pee more  darker nipples  food cravings  since youre still young and developing you might have complications at birth, my boyfriends sister is 18 and just had her baby 2 days ago, she was all set to go but during the delivery they found her pelvis was too small and it was putting stress on the baby so they had to have a c section. she and i are the same size im just a little taller and the dr said that i might run into the same or similar problems(im 19 and 23 w4d)   other than that if you take good care of yourself throughout the pregnancy,assuming you are, then there shouldnt be any problems.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Because of your age, there is a chance your baby could be born prematurely...but that's about as far as the physical differences go.    It's probably for the social stigma that affects pregnant teens emotionally, than anything physical.    Thankfully, I haven't been judged much, except for a few 'welfare baby' comments in the past.  Just silly!  I hate people who use Welfare because they are too lazy to get a job too...don't get me wrong...but I'm tired of people thinking it's me!  I have a job..not a great one...but I'm proud I don't live off taxpayers.  The first signs would be a missed period, sore breasts etc, which would probably start around the tie your period was due.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	The biggest negative effect I can think of is that we ( the taxpayers ) will quite possibly end up paying the tab for your medical care and feeding your kid.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	im 18 and pregnant, i noticed i wanted to sleep through my classes, i had to pee a lot, i burped a lot too which is weird, im breaking out that doesnt happen to me, no your baby will be fine :) good luck!|`|KlIhfO6naa	did you get your period late?    If so you are pregnant
fG7LmB7Kaa	God i wish it was my favorite sleep aid before i got pregnant. But since it is not FDA monitored they suggest against it since it could have additives that could be harmful to your baby. You can take unisom daily throughout pregnancy (itake half a tab a night) been ok'd by Dr many online sites and pregnancy risk line. I have done lots of research on this. hope it helps you get the sleep you need.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	NO|`|lY5YDFizaa	I would not make a habit of it, if you already took it dont worry about it
xy0W50Lqaa	Well my daughter is going to be 1 year old next week and her EDD is today!   I remember exactly how it felt to be 6 weeks pregnat because I was 6 weeks when I took my pregnancy test.  I felt like I had no energy, even to breath, I know that may sound weird.  I felt sick up until I was 9 weeks, my breasts were bigger, and my sense of smell was very strong, e.g pegging out washing and smelling the washing detergent very easily.  I also felt dizzy at times.  These are all classic symptoms of the first trimester.  The second one is great because your body will have adjusted to the pregnancy and most of us feel great.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I am, i just get morning sickness if i dont keep a full stomach and some lower back pain, hopefully thats all ill get (wishful thinking)|`|nCKdkYSyaa	IF i am pregnant (I havent missed my period yet) which means i would be 4 weeks, and i dont have any signs either, All i have noticed was I Am very hot, Very sleepy and I have noticed bigger boobs, lol but its normal to feel alot of symptoms or none at all every woman is differant, and wish me luck :)|`|tDcwZi2Kaa	no|`|JDw1RDcaaa	I didnt have any symptoms at all until i was three months even then i only felt like a had a stomach bug cuz i felt a bit sick. Everyone is different and my cousin had morning sickness and cramps from 4 weeks|`|ahDUOe48aa	well i am very tired and drowsy. I feel dizzy once in a while some times my breast are sore, some times i feel fine. today i threw up for the first because the prenantal viatamins get me nauesous. but now i fell fine|`|y7Ex3n0yaa	I am almost 6 weeks pregnant and I constantly want to sleep, I have real sore boobs, my lower back is really achy and I feel sick but want to eat lol.

AA10079820	I would definitely go to the doctor. There might be an after hours clinic near where you live. Or you could always just go Monday.  The people on call always downplay your fears.  It might not be infected. You might just be tired from bleeding. Possibly, you are anemic.   But if it really, really hurt when this happened you could have torn a stitch. I thought I did once when I had my daughter, but it turned out I didn't. Just pulled at them.  Make sure you take the stool softeners and if you still have that spray bottle from the hospital or a water bottle, spray some warm water down there after you use the restroom.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	Hi, i had 30 stitches after having my son.  It was hard for me to sit down for a few days, and especially uncomfortable to do number 2.  I was given metamucil to soften my stools, and was not to use toilet paper for at least 2 weeks - as soon as i did  2 i had to shower to get all the yuckiness off.  But i would go to a doctor and get it checked, better to make a trip for nothing as opposed to getting and infection.|`|u12eVaDhaa	Hi, I didn't have quite the same experience but I had a LOT of tearing that just wouldn't heal.  Bits of it kept re-opening.  I went back to the Doctor and he said I was low in iron (which would explain why you are feeling weak) and that caused me to heal much more slowly.  So if you have any iron supplements handy it might be worth taking them.    Best wishes|`|Hf9snNyzaa	I had a hard time going   2 as well after I was cut and then he ripped me pretty good. The bright red blood is fine... the darker stuff is what you have to worry about. It took me almost a month to poop normally and sometimes it still is uncomfortable... as long as you rinse yourself after you go and clean well you shouldnt have any problem with infection... taking baths really helps... relaxes the muscles and speeds healing along.|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I actually had this exact thing happen. As soon as the episiotemy  was done, I tore completely through and had so many stitches that I couldn't sit, stand or walk normal for two weeks like yourself. About 5 weeks after my son was born I felt like I tore again and I was bleeding more and it hurt to use the restroom again.  I went in to my doctor because I was worried I tore again or the stitches came out, etc.  It turns out the stitches were dis solvable and that's exactly what they had done. What I was actually feeling was the stitches being gone and the skin being more tight down there.    If I were you though I would go in and get it checked just to be on the safe side.  YOu might have torn again or something else could be going on. It's better to be safe!!|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	I had a 3rd degree epis. with a 4th degree tear, so front to back.  ALOT of stitches, inside and out.  I was scared sh!tless to go  2.  I was horrified I would rip a stitch out.  I hurt so bad after about a week in the perinium area that I called up to the Labor and Delivery at my hosp. (the nurses knew me by then b/c I called so many times lol) and the head nurse told me to just go ahead and run up there so she could look at it - as my doctor was in freaking Honduras.    I ended up having an infection which was why I was hurting so bad.  I could not sit down nor could I walk it hurt SO bad.  All I could do was lay down.  I got antibiotics and got better.  I also had a hemmorhoid which is another reason I hurt.  Tucks are good for those.  AND I had a stitch or two that were poking me (near the end of the tear) which is why I felt pain right there. (Kind of where you are describing).  I think I called those nurses at the hospital and the ones at my docs office like a MILLION times thinking I ripped a stitch out lol.  But those things are in there pretty good.  I doubt you did.      But it's always better safe than sorry.  I promise you it will ease your mind to go to the doc or hospital and make SURE there is nothing going on down there that shouldn't be.  Just take some stool softeners or even Milk of Magnesia....don't strain.  My doc told me not to strain AT ALL for 6 weeks.      I will tell you if it is infected, you want to catch it right away or it could get messy.  That is what the oncall doc told me at the hosp. when I went up there.  He said I caught it early which was a good thing, b/c if not it could get messy and it wouldn't be good.  But I was hurting really bad so I knew something wasn't right.    If it were me, I would go to the hosp...but I tend to freak out about everything lol....dang anxiety lol...    But good luck sweetie - I know how bad this sucks right now, I promise.|`|UVncUmpNaa	Dont freek out to the point where it makes you sick.. but i would go in now for help..|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	i wouldn't wait til monday. go to the hospital now. it's better to be safe than sorry.|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	Something similar happened to me. Try and limit your food intake so you won't have to use the restroom so much. you know what i mean. then if you do have to go, make sure you use that water bottle thing to cleanse the area really well after you use the restroom. definitely use stool softeners. then go to the dr on monday to get things checked out.
PFO1jxZGaa	well my daughter came out vaginally with the cord wrapped around her neck twice and she as fine BUT she came out after 5 hours of labor and 4 pushes, so in your case I say the dr was absolutely right with his decision but even if he wasnt there is no going back anymore so just enjoy your daughter and be happy she and you are doing good :)|`|ioZeveazaa	Yeah I think you really did need a c-section. Your baby was in distress so it had to be gotten out safely and quickly and c-section was efficient in that. Good luck with your new baby!|`|iMULlxdgaa	SOunds liek the doctor choose correctly...you don't want to take that chance , even if there is a 50% percent chance that you baby would be fine..wuld you only want it to be 50%.  With the c-section the doctor was assuring a 100% survival of you baby. I think he did the right thing and hope my doctor would chose the same if I was in that position.  I just want my baby to come out alive and screaming his head off!.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	No, you were right to have a c-section, a vaginal delivery would have ended in fetal death.    But that doesn't mean you can't have a vaginal delivery in the future if you desire, but for now continue to be grateful for a living healthy baby - which is what you wanted.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Sorry...but the doctor has the one goal...healthy baby, healthy momma.     I didn't want a c-section either. We found out later I have a hinky cervix...20 hours after the bag broke high---meaning I t dribbled, and kept refilling and huge doses of pitocin my cervix would still not dilate.  The rule was if the cervix doesn't go beyond a certain point once the waters broke, the child is at risk of infection.    What you describe sounds like a good call on the doctor's part.    Ignore the hype...sometimes a c-section is needed.    Good luck.|`|d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I had a similar labor to that with my second baby. The cord was wrapped around her neck as well and I went in for an emergency c-section. I've heard plenty of negatives about the c-sections but I don't really care since my baby was born happy, healthy and strong. 5 years after that I don't have a single regret about the c-section at all.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I think your baby survived because of the c-section.     I have had three and I do not think I could have changed anything if I could have......if that makes sense.|`|9j6MvZrEaa	a baby cannot come out face first. Ive had 2 cesareans and am due for my 3rd monday , you have a happy healthy baby and i think your doctor made a great choice , if he hadnt you might be planning services !|`|OwK17Qo1aa	The cord was wrapped around her neck, yes you needed the a c-section. My SIL was in labor for 36 hours and pushed for two hours. She went to a midwife and the midwife wouldn't give up. My SIL really pushed she wanted to go to the doctor.  The cord was wrapped around her neck twice and they were glad she made the call. Doctor told her that if she kept on pushing could have lost both of them.|`|isIuI8aMaa	No one can tell you that kind of an answer unless they were a Dr. and was present at the time.  You just have to live with your Dr.'s decision and be thankful that your baby is fine.  Don't listen to everyones elses hype!  People always get on some kind of banwaggon.  It sounds like you were in labor alot longer than normal and your baby was in jeopardy so my opinion is that it was the right decision.  I had 2 C-sections.  Both were scary and I hated the epideral because it took them 12 times before they got it in.  I had nightmares for months about it.|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Wow they let you go 38 hours before an epidural and then another 6 hours.     Yes you and the drs did the right thing. That baby needed to come out. They did not pull the trigger too quick!     Once your water breaks its important to get things done fast. And fast all the hard labor in pain your body is tired I can see why you didnt dialate fast.    with the cord and baby face up....it was the best thing.     congrats on a healthy baby
379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	It feels like a mix between PMS and a hangover. You may feel bloated, breast soreness, moody...then you also may feel very tired, nauseous, and have body aches. Wait at least 5 days to test. Good luck!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	It makes you feel really crappy, it's worse than having just a simple upset stomach. You always feel like you want to throw up & sometimes you do, you can't stand the scent of things sometimes it's stuff that you normally wouldn't have a problem with, most times you just want to crawl up in a corner & shut out everything & everybody for how horrible the feeling is. I hated the scent of my hubby's lotion when I was pregnant & would curse him out everytime he used it bear in mind I loved to smell it before I was pregnant. All in all it sucks but the reward at the end makes it all worth the while :)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	it feels like your gonna die ='(|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Morning sickness for me was allllll day nausea.  It didn't come on until about two weeks after I found out I was pregnant though.  My first tell tale sign was incredibly sore boobs.  Certain things that normally didn't bother me at all would make me hurl.  The smell of coffee and bananas in particular.    I hope you are preggerz! Good luck!|`|HOdblqIkaa	morning sickness for me was horrible and it went all day. certain smells would make me gag and the sight/smell of cheese made me throw up. i didnt have any headaches or other pains just constantly felt the need to throw up. ever certain sounds made me sick. i know aquarium water doesnt smell the best, but i also know that pretty much everyone can handle it so if it made you sick then i would say sounds like morning sickness to me|`|UaL28atDaa	It could be morning sickness but you should consult a doctor to be sure. This video will explain more about morning sickness. Also see the video on avoiding morning sickness for future reference, it will be very useful!      http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...    Good Luck!|`|UX3xjsFlaa	That does sound like morning sickness, but it usually doesnt start 7 days after a missed period- whether you are pregnant or not. Do your breasts hurt? Any other symptoms? You should wait a few days and take a test.|`|OSAaln2Laa	I had the constant feeling that I had to gag when I had my morning (AKA all day) sickness. Also, the smell of dog food made me want to barf. But IMO it may be a little too early to experience morning sickness if you are still awaiting your period. It could be stress or PMS. I guess you just have to wait and see. Good luck!|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Its a constant feeling that you could gag at any second, and then you actually do gag. I used to chain-gag a few times in a row if I smelled something awful.

4KXA5oVtaa	No, definitely not true.  If this were the case doctors wouldn't women go 'over-due.'  Keep in mind, unless women can actually pin point the exact date they got pregnant, the 40 week mark is a calculation of when the baby if full term.  Your 41 week mark might actually be 39.  Don't worry, as long as the baby is moving around and you feel ok, the placenta is just fine.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sometimes, it's really after 42 weeks that this happens or if you're a smoker (of course if you smoke, or drink, it will reek of cigarettes - or alcohol - too).   My 41 week 5 day placenta for my youngest was clear of any calcium deposits, looked just like a fluffy liver - so you never really know.    From the first link "Although the quantity varies from placenta to placenta, immature placentas rarely have a significant amount of calcium, whereas postdates placentas may be densely gritty.  It is an unreliable sign of maturity, and the quantity does not impact function and therefore it is of no clinical importance."|`|FIALhwlKaa	Its normal that the placenta gets calcified. It doesnt stop working at all, but it can happen that the baby doesnt get enough of the things which it needs. Thats why you have the ultrasound examination. The docs can see when the placenta has to much calc and they will react.  My daughter came 2 weeks earlier because of that.
vcRm8ps8aa	the period you described as "light" sounds strange. You may be pregnant or you may not be. Even though you say you havent been stressed, you may have been stressed thinking about the possible pregnancy and this could be what has caused the pains and the strange period. You also could have taken the test too early. I would recomend taking a test as soon as possible using first morning urine. Tomorrow morning, wee into a container and keep it safe, then buy a pregnancy test and dip it in. It should say if you are pregnant or not by now. If your period doesnt come in the next 2 weeks then i would go to the doctor, although there is not alot that they can do (from personal experience)|`|lhn1wNoeaa	You can weight for a week and take a test. Try to take morning test as your hormone level will be more.    Best Wishes!!

q0ZbjwExaa	Analyze his strengths and weaknesses and take a self-defense course.

The reason that he won't stop picking on you is because you keep letting him.   You don't stand up for yourself and he knows that your not going to so he is able to keep picking on you without repercussion.   You need to figure out how to stand up to him. I say get into a fight with him. Who cares if you get in trouble with teachers or parents even if you dont win the fight if you keep at it..then hell soon relieze that your not going to be easy to pick on and he'll move on.|`|GUswFG2Raa	Fight Em, Duh!|`|vDjy1eKDaa	grow some balls and whoop his a**..thats what i did with my bullies when i was in high school..and they never messed with me again lol|`|TVouwqeVaa	here's a  quick way to get rid of them.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	You could go to the ER but all they're going to do is give you internal exam and put you on a monitor to make sure the baby isn't stressed. Then they will probably send you home, what would suggest is buying a monitor from BabiesRUs, so you could check the baby's heart rate yourself and if your really anxious to get things going yourself you could try using black and/or blue cohosh tincture. 15 drops an hour should soften, open you cervix and push your contractions closer together.  Use these herbs at your own risk and please research them yourself on the internet.|`|oIFMohfUaa	Mommyof3 is right on.    There are SO MANY tiny vessels in the cervix and they break easily!  If you've had sex or an exam, it can cause the bleeding.    It could also be dilation causing you to lose your mucous plug.  It is thicker and more like a "snail/slug" consistancy...brownish/pinkish blood tinged.    Brownish blood is old blood.  It's already "aging" and breaking down.      Always ask your ob/midwife.      If your cramps continue regularly, and more intense I would get checked.  Otherwise, they may be from constipation.  If you have any burning and cramping, you may have a bladder infection.     Take a stool, or something to put your feet up on, and sit on the toilet...take a book.  This takes some pressure off and moves the baby a little and maybe you can have a B.M.  (My dr started me on this and after 5 kids, I still use it!) It takes pressure off of hemorrhoids too!    PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HERBALS WITHOUT CONSULTING YOUR DOCTOR!    In any case, not much longer to wonder!  LOL!    Good luck~|`|jgtfWjE4aa	GO TO THE ER! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING!?

Do not take any bull from them in the hospital. Exaggerate the pain if need be.  Do not take any risk at this stage with your baby.   You should not be bleeding unless there is a problem.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	The bleeding enough should be enough to get you headed to the ER, better safe than sorry is always my baby mentality! Best of luck to you!|`|6yYeCVQFaa	MY GOD!!!! Go to the friggin emergency room NOW!!!! Don't listen to that 'you're ok' crap. Something is wrong. God bless you!|`|sF9DIXS5aa	you will know when you are actually in labor when the pain gets alot worse is when i would head to the hospital.|`|UDX7yqD2aa	It's so hard to tell because every woman is different. Labor is never the same for everyone.  If you think you may be in labor I would go ahead and go get checked.  I bled off & on for a week & 1/2 with my 3rd kiddo. I also had contractions off & on for weeks.  I will tell you though that when I went into labor there was absolutely NO doubt I was in labor.  The best tip I had was when my midwife told me that if I'm having trouble talking through my contractions, I'm probably in labor.  Try drinking some water and lay down on your side. You may even try a warm bath or shower.  If they continue then get checked. If they go away or slow down, it's not time yet.  Good luck. I know it's frustrating but have heart. Your day will come soon.   Oh..and 1cm is good! It means your body is doing its job. Don't be discouraged.
giKCTfnfaa	under hipa laws, no they cannot tell your parents.  however, if there is any sort of insurance involved, the eob's (explanation of benefits) will tell them what was paid out by the insurance company.  you will not be able to get medicaid or any other government assistance without parental incomes (this may vary from state to state).    you'll have to tell them eventually.  might as well do it sooner than later!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No- by law they can not tell your parents but you will have to tell them some time.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Nope they cannot tell your parent anything unless they want to loose their licens and have their lives ruined Im 17 and pregnant also, you can get any kind of medical treatment concerning pregnancy even go to the ER without you parents becuase you are acting as the mother in the case of pregnancy depending on the state you live in|`|hG8tLBSMaa	drs arent supposed to give out info... but you are a minor...|`|iwYu32N2aa	If you think that you are old enough and responsible enough to be engaged at 17, you should have no problem telling your mom that your pregnant|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i don't think so i think that would be breaking patient  dr confidentiality   good luck to u  and u should probly tell ur mom she will help u through keep in mind she may be disappointed but she will come around shes ur mom she loves u and will help u|`|6yYeCVQFaa	How long do you plan to keep it a secret?

AA11826783	NOT TRUE! Of course not! What gave you that idea? Lots of...er...obese people can have babys!|`|AA11429639	There was a study published in the British Medical Journal that found that very lean women and very obese women (BMI >38) had lower conception rates. However, body fat distribution was found to have a greater impact. Women with a high waist-hip ratio had greater trouble conceiving -- so being shaped like an apple is not as good for conception as being shaped like a pear.    Here's some good information:    http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/bbwfaq....|`|d077b35c8a2ecd2b9f7a611409dd35f4aa	No, one should not assume weight alone is a problem. It can be, but it is not a given. In fact, weight is probably only a factor less than 10 percent of the time. The primary obstacle for overweight women is ovulation. If your physician suggests all your problems will be solved simply by losing weight, seek a second opinion because even if your weight is an issue, it is something medications can work around.   What are the most common weight-related reasons for infertility?   The two most common problems are excess estrogen and polycystic ovaries (PCO). Along with both of these is a greater chance of a luteal phase defect (LPD).     Estrogen: Fat cells produce estrogen. The problem is that if you get too much estrogen your body reacts as if it is on birth control. Ovulation may not occur o|`|AA11896942	Not always true.  You should see your OB/GYN anyway if you're trying to conceive, so they can check you out and make sure everything's okay to get started.  You'd hate to waste a year or so, only to find out later that you have some kind of problem (like I did).      Plenty of overweight women have healthy pregnancies, although it does raise your risk for things like gestational diabetes (I think that's what it's called).  Anyway, talk with your doctor and I would recommend a book called "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler.  Good luck to you!|`|AA12048794	Obesity doesn't cause infertility, but it does add a lot of complications, as well as problems for the baby.  I think you might want to increase your activity definitely, because when it comes to labor, it might become very difficult to the baby.    I hope you succeed, but definitely be careful.|`|0cd614f1916fe3a0e7e55c61e721edc5aa	Yes, obesity CAN cause some forms of infertility, but it primarily affects the morbidly obese. You may want to get back down to a healthier weight before trying though, not because of the likelyhood of concieving, but because complications such as pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes are greatly increased. ( I had gestational diabetes with my son due to my own weight.) You want to give your baby the best possible start in life, and you can do so by taking care of yourself before you concieve, through the pregnancy, and setting a good example on health and nutrition for the rest of your life. Whatever lifestyle you have is much more likely to become the habits of your child than something you don't practice. If you want your kid to be healthy, you can start with yourself. I know it's hard, I myself have lost over a hundred pounds in the last two years. But my three year old son will pass up a plate of mac and cheese for a bowl of mixed vegtables. And I can do things with my son I never could before, like run around the park. If you get yourself in shape, and drop some weight, you'll feel better about yourself, and be a better mom. Good luck to you!|`|AA12132317	I was morbidly obese and I had a problem ovulating. But with the help of clomoid a fertility medicine I had a baby boy. Then I lost a ton of weight and had 1 natural.

5ZvALiclaa	the wonderful antibodies he gets from your breastmilk should protect him from getting sick. Of course its still possible but probably unlikely. <br>  <br>  I was really really sick with the longest flu ever at the end of my pregnancy (right thru my labour which was awful!) and up till he was about 6 weeks old. He never go so much as a sniffle so your bubs should be right.<br>  <br>  Remember to wash your hands heaps to avoid spreading the germs though|`|qNdsNhgOaa	It's highly unlikely that he'll catch what you have.  When you breastfeed and you start coming down with something, your body quickly produces antibodies against whatever virus that you have, in order to make it possible to safely continue breastfeeding.  No worries!  Also, you can try to frequently wash your hands and use hand sanitizers for extra measure.  That's what I always do anyway.  Best wishes and get well soon!|`|DsT3kOdBaa	He might, but chances are probably not...but even if its just a could it wont hurt it him, it actually might benefit him, it will help build up his immune system...just make sure its a cold and not flu first before deciding to breastfeed again|`|AA11795652	I was there once and didn't get my baby sick; however, most of the time, because I had to be in contact with my baby so much, he eventually got sick but not as bad as I was.|`|7060eafce3928f5687a405e1d56fae80aa	You could try using a medical mask if that makes you feel safer for your son|`|vGxipYJnaa	Actually, you need to continue breastfeeding your son during your illness because it protects him from catching your cold. I was worried about the same thing when I became ill while breastfeeding, and my doctor (and some follow-up research) confirmed that not only will your son not get your cold from your breastmilk, but he'll get the antibodies to fight your cold from you, too. <br>  <br>  While you may feel blah, your little boy will stay healthy. It's pretty cool how that works.

My son was breastfed and projectile vomiting a few times|`|J9Tbun7naa	My daughter had her first taste of formula when she was about 3 months old. She never had a full feed..only tops offs after a breastfeed, totalling maybe 100mls over 3 days. The 3rd night we ended up in the ER because she was threw up 3 subsequent feeds (over a period of 12 hours) and wouldn't even keep water down.<br>  She is dairy intolerant. <br>  There is a difference between lactose and dairy. All mamalian milk (inc humans) contains lactose... but cow's milk (which "normal" formulas) are based on contain a dairy protein...it is very common for children to be intolerant to this protein but grow out of it as they grow up. And allergy and an intolerance are NOT the same thing. Your son is definitely not allergic. An allergice reaction happens immediately and is often charaterised by things like difficulty breathing, vomting etc (anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction). An intlerance is characterised by delayed onset of (most commonly) a rash, diarhhea and/or vomiting.<br>  <br>  You may like to talk to your paed about trialling a different formula (my daughter's doc suggested Lactose free first...I don't understand how that workd since she is having lactose in the breastmilk but the doc told me it was something to do with a different protien....and if that didn't work try soy or goat's milk based.<br>  <br>  Many babies who are allergic to dairy are also allergic to soy and soy is the last option.<br>  If you research soy you will find some pretty alarming facts about it. I have read a great answer on here basically saying the facts are all BS... here's a link to the question with the good answer (I just found it really useful lol)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Al04rnyC_h72z7O9HKb16vfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081105215648AAWCea4&show=7#profile-info-a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  It's in voting ATM... the useful answer is the one with "mum of 1...medical background" at the end<br>  <br>  <br>  and another link I found helpful\<br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/lactose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/l...</a><br>  it has a small bit about dairy intolerance but it is helpful to understand the diff between dairy and lactose intolerance<br>  <br>  <br>  The other option is to try and pump pump pump so you can get a stock of breatmilk that you can use rather than having to resort to formula... my daughter is 9 months,and I've only ust started giving her formula because I was too woried about her having problems with any I tried...if you do want to find a formula he can take, email the formula companies and ask for samples of the different types to save spending a fortune on a tin he cannot tolerate<br>  <br>  <br>  Also....even better would be to resolve the latching problem of course...if you haven't already, you may like to contact a lacation consultant<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|KICQQxLxaa	It is definitely possible to be allergic or intolerant to formula, but take breastmilk just fine.<br>  <br>  Have you met with a certified lactation consultant to help you get him latch on?  Try to keep pumping as much as you can....it sounds  like the breastmilk agrees with him better.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	I don't really have a lot to offer here but wanted to say congrats on your new baby boy :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  
64f13ebc351ba331cc6461bee88bd75baa	Highly unlikely, though not impossible.|`|AA10184676	you can get pregnant no matta what u do if ur unprotected hun.  wait is that right?.......... uh.....|`|AA11613544	I got pregnant on the second to last day of my period.  I was also on the pill.  If you are afraid of having a child, abstain from sex until both you and your partner are ready.  The truth is, our bodies are irregular.  There are times when you are more likely to be fertile, but nothing is for sure, and people like me prove that every day.  No matter how "careful" you are, babies happen, so be prepared, or wait on sex.  If however, you are TRYING to get pregnant, then yes, you could be, but maybe not.  Sperm can survive for up to 5 days, so even if you arent ovulating at the time you have sex, you may ovulate within a few days and get pregnant by the sperm that are still alive in you.  Good luck, and God bless.  Remember that babies are NEVER an accident, and even if its not your intention to have one, and you do, take responsibility for your actions.    PS- after reading a previous question of yours, you should not be having sex with a man who you KNOW doesnt want children and isnt commited to you.  Its unfair to both of you, and ESPECIALLY unfair to the child that you may create.  Having unprotected sex with a man who has no interest in a commitment with you, and already has children he doesnt take care of is very irresponsible.  Chilren without fathers often have a tough time in life.  Girls tend to turn out promiscuous, trying to fill the hole of male love, and boys tend to turn out as commitment-phobes or bad fathers.  An innocent child deserves the BEST, and its your job to make sure that the person you sleep with is someone who wants to spend the rest of their life with you, have children with you, and do a damn good job raising them.  Otherwise, you are just adding to the population of screwed up kids, and thats the last thing this world needs|`|91e7c89658ab1125e7194d88b255c97eaa	Yeah....and you knew this, hopefully you were trying to get pregnant.|`|104ec8ddf5a47ec54d7a8a881913807daa	I don't know.|`|d5b7cc3bf8b390d938ebc6c2df9f1472aa	no,its not likely you will get pregnant(still a possibility)but most people do not concieve until two weeks ather there period when there ovulating|`|AA10887794	you will have to wait and see or get on birth control.|`|e8fe17e5daa1da20d1a89c9e09ed3aa4aa	the best web site to check out is www.mymonthlycycle.com it will help you chart your period and tell you when you are most fertile.|`|AA11217464	yes u can surelly get pregnant whatever your period is, cos average life of sperm is 3 days, that's how it all counted, but sometimes sperm can live up to 2 weeks. that's how u might get into trouble. i got pregnant twice - once when i had unprotected sex 2 days before due period and when i had sex on the last day of my period. once i got pregnant through condom. so as u can see i have 3 miracle children now. if u go to doctor now u might get this pill abortion , which is much better than average one. good luck|`|a4c4fad5ac68d2d591ed33ddd060d97eaa	NO. Get it out of your head.|`|090f10250b6842d4c777ddeba611164faa	Every women is not the same, but if you started your period on the 01st it ended on the 05th.  You ovulate from around the 09th to the 14th but not every day.  You should be safe but in the future please use protection if you do not want a baby.  It is very foolish to have unprotected sex if you are not in a serious relatinoship.|`|d4bb34926cc5285d4324f5fb33dd393daa	Probably not hun. if you started your period on the first and you're like the average woman, you'll ovulate on the 14th.  5+7 is 12. Most sperm don't live past seven days, usually they don't live past three. So, if the sperm lives a week inside of you, and you ovulate earlier than normal, if your cycles are shorter than 28 days, then you might want to test in a month. Don't get yourself all worried though, you probably dodged the bullet on this one. next time use protection

BFuYtDl2aa	I used a lot of different bottles, but Playtex Drop-Ins were by far the best. You can push the air out of them so no gas... They are extremely convenient to use while traveling. I am pregnant again and due in Feb. also and without a doubt will be using the Playtex Drop-Ins. I breastfed and my son had no problem switching back and forth. He rarely spit up and when he did it was only a tiny amount. He was a very happy baby, not at all colicky or gassy.<br>  <br>  The only downside is having to buy the liners, but Wal-mart has a generic brand that fit the Playtex bottles that are a little cheaper. And In My Opinion well worth the money.|`|308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	The best bottles are Dr. Browns or playtex airvent which reduce gas and help with colic, but really any bottle that is BPA free is good. As far as nipples go, if you are breastfeeding then, go with the NUK silicone nipples, because they simulate a nipple so the baby does not get confused between the real nipple and the bottle.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	playtex ventaire advanced...put seal tight , make sure it stays in place and you dont have leaks like some complaim of with them;<br>  clinically shown to reduce gas, fussiness, etc.....<br>  <br>  easy to wash bc both ends comes off; dd is five mos and we are still using the same ones with the oriiginal parts|`|IcH5gMICaa	As a newborn, I recommend the Playtex drop ins.  The sterilized drop-ins prevent a lot of air from being swallowed, which makes newborns really irritable and gassy.  As they get older and start eating more, I recommend Advent.|`|GognIJnBaa	I like the Playtex Ventaire!  Not a fan of glass bottles - too worried about breaking them.|`|qygYwdRpaa	I like Avent |`|EHY3FnAmaa	We use Avent, so far they have been great. I am a first time Mommy as well, my son is 4 weeks old|`|5EFc1QYbaa	Playtex drop-ins hands down.  Along with many other types I tried the Playtex Vent-Aire also and found no difference in reducing air.  WAY too many parts to wash.  I wish I'd had the drop-ins for my first born.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide on be sure they are BPA free!<br>  <br>  ***NOTE - While they are great, Avent bottles are are not BPA free.  Got rid of all mine and replaced them.|`|Yl3C9svGaa	I would suggest the drop ins.  They are really convenient, easy to clean, and are great for traveling.  My daughter had no major problems with air/gas.  I am planning on using them again for my next baby.  The only negative would be the cost of the liners, but it was worth it to me.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i used evenflo at the begining, the ones that are suppose to prevent air... yah, waste of money... i found the plain ol' gerber plastic bottles were fine...and they didnt cost an arm and a leg...<br>  if you can find glass bottles for the first few months, they are the best... i had them with number one, but you cant find them here anymore..|`|VTB5QpyBaa	My daughter is 9 weeks old. I like using the Playtex Ventaire Advanced System. They cost less and work great. They trap out air really well and I have noticed less spit ups since I started using them. They are also easy to clean, and my baby loves them. |`|2E9pG4j5aa	dr drowns bottles are the best thing since sliced bread!!!!!!!!!!! i love them and i have tried every kind of bottle available and dr drowns are the best!!:) hope this helps and best of luck with your little one xox|`|CZaKcvADaa	I think glass are best because you don't have to worry about the plastic taking on germs or chemicals being transmitted into the formula or breast milk when heated. Good Luck.|`|fdWIP0Yiaa	Avent bottles, very easy to use and decreases gas for the baby, by far the best|`|9ycWyizTaa	Geber!|`|xf1ZT9QSaa	I have a 2 year old little girl, and I breast fed her for the first 6 months,  When I decided to go to a bottle I tried EVERY bottle i could.  The only ones that didn't give her gas were Playtex nurser   <br>  drop-ins system.  They were the BEST!  The liners will cost a little more, but they are SOOOO worth it to have a happy non gassy baby. <br>  <br>  I did notice that the playtex ventaire and Dr brown's bottles Leaked very bad.  Regular bottles made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable.  Avent bottles are pretty good, and the ones with liners are just as good as the playtex drop ins.  just a little more expensive.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS!  and Good luck!!<br>  |`|e4xovpfUaa	I used the Breastflow bottles by First Years. They are the closest to breastfeeding. I nursed for the first 6 weeks and then due to a medical condition I had to switch to formula and these were the only bottle my daughter would take. They were the only ones that she did not spit up everything with. |`|mlvmoBlUaa	It can really vary from baby to baby.  Don't stock up on one particular brand until after your baby is born.  You may have to try a few bottles before you find one that works well for your baby.  Some bottles that work great for other babies, may leave your baby with gas, or may be hard for your baby to drink from.  Buy a few types of different bottles.... and see what your baby does well with.... then go out and buy some more.  <br>  <br>  Personally, we found that the playtex vent air (wide) worked great for us.  We used wide because that's what is recommend for nursing mothers.  IF your not nursing.... then it won't matter if you buy regular or wide as much..... but I am no longer nursing and I still purchase wide just because I think they work great for my son.  |`|NuHE26iZaa	use ONLY BPA free bottles ..they found a few months ago that almost all name brand bottles were made with bpa which is a harmful chemical that gets released in ur baby's milk ... there are many bottles now that are bpa just make sure u check!|`|rgujmsMRaa	lol parents choice... the nipple is more important.... in my opinion... i got a set of Soothie's at my shower and my kid hates them.. so i have $60 of bottles i'll never use!
ZlNFOgO7aa	Hun I got pregnant at 30 accidentally, yes a 30yo had an accident, lol. I already had two children but was accepted to Uni and both my partner and I had plans which we could start implementing because our kids were getting older and not needing us so much. I was less than thrilled, I went to the Doctor to see about getting a permanent contraceptive and he did a scan and I found out I was 8 weeks pregnant and I have a fertility disorder and have only ever got pregnant with fertility drugs and the Doctors intervention. I was devastated. I suffered bad bad nausea and barely ate, couldn't sleep and felt more awful by the day. I ended up on antidepressants (I already have an anxiety disorder anyway) and I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy nearly 4 weeks ago. I still think about what I could be doing right now, but my baby will only be a baby for a short while, then I can do the things we were going to.<br>  <br>  It took nearly all of the pregnancy to feel good about it.|`|U5RObaBGaa	Ok now it is completely understandable that you are pretty much dreading this pregnancy no one can blame you for that, I mean your last one far from uneventful, but each pregnancy is different and you may find that this oe is different, go talk to your midwife, there will be support for you out there and she can point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|QIPuSe8zaa	I'm sort of surprised with all the other issues and starting your career back that you would choose to have another child.  I know that you did modeling before your first child was born and this will obviously set that career back another year or two.  Don't feel guilty, as you said life happens.  Just make the best of it and hopefully your second child will be a real treat in terms of how your pregnancy goes and in terms of how it behaves during it's first year.  You need to get going on your website before you become too pregnant to post  lol|`|xEXb96UKaa	i felt the same when i found out i was pregnant with my second. my daughter would scream all the time and i simply couldn't settle her. it took me about 9 months before i started to bond with her. so when i found out i was expecting again i was petrified.<br>  but the second baby was so much easier to handle, don't know if it was the fact that i had a bit of experience this this around or because i expected the worst. but he was a joy and i had no trouble with him and i have third baby now.<br>  the first baby is difficult for most new mums because we simply don't know what we're doing, there is no instruction booklet that comes out with the baby. but like me, other mums will tell you the same thing. the second baby is a breeze because you already know how to hold a baby, how to bath it, feed it and the fact that it doesn't hurt them to be left crying for a few minutes, you'll have the confidence that a first time mum doesn't usually have, so try not to worry yourself.<br>  congrats, try and enjoy the pregnancy.|`|WaI693jHaa	Please don't take this as criticism, but if the whole thing is so traumatic, why did you decide to have another child?<br>  If you're doing it for the sake of your husband or family, I think you're making a big mistake.<br>  Your comment "Has anyone else felt dread rather than elation when finding out your pregnant" sounds as if getting pregnant is something that just happens to you rather than something you can easily avoid if you don't want to become pregnant.|`|hmX4ko0Eaa	I have suffered with obstetric cholestasis in 3 out of 4 of my pregnancies.

All babies are different too and hopefully this time your baby will be a better sleeper (my second baby is a MUCH better sleeper than my first was)<br>  <br>  Also with the depression, if it does happen this time round you will notice the signs right away and you can get help ASAP. Talk to your doctor about all these things and see if he can refer you to a counsellor, it might help just having someone to chat to.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|MmbEk1bTaa	no honey, dont feel guilty!

My 1st pregnancy had been awful, i felt sick morning noon and night, and exhausted! At 29 weeks i was adm to hosp with pre elampsia, and they told me i may have to have my baby at 29 weeks! Luckily a month long hospital stay kept my bp controlled! However at 33 weeks i just went into premature labour! My baby had to stay in hosp 3 weeks and it was awful!<br>  i suffered with dreadful post natal depression, and they also had to get my blood pressure down, after the birth too! <br>  With my 2nd pregnancy i was under consultant care, and they did everything they could to make sure history didn't repeat it's self! i was on asprin to help prevent prevent pre eclampsia, i had vaginal swabs to detect group b strep ( they realsied that was why i had my son 7 weeks early) I eventually had him full term and no pre eclampsia! I did have pnd but i was treated 4 days after he was born! So it was much easier! I went on to have a 3rd child who was also born at 33 weeks like my 1st, ( after my waters breaking at 30 weeks ) My 4th child was born full term and he was the only one i didn't have pnd with! The only thing i did different with his pregnancy was to have regular osteopath treatment! <br>  anyway, get your consultant to look after you and your doctor, hopefully this time history wont repeat it's self! |`|IKl1hS4qaa	as far as i know no two pregnancies are the same so you can perhaps be happy that you went through that since you know it cannot get any worse, and, on the contrary there's a good chance that it'll be much easier.<br>  No matter what, even when it gets hard, try to think of that fact that you have a new life growing in you and that life wants to be loved. I strongly believe that a baby who feels very loved in the womb -and afterwards- will be a more happy and quiet baby overall|`|QoIrPx6uaa	really, it can only get better,im not surprised you are apprehensive,but subsequent births are generally easier than the first.you know what is ahead,and you have faced,and come through a tough time,with a beautiful ,thriving child to show for it.<br>  relax, and accept your current pregnancy. and dont feel guilty,or apologise for how you feel....as you said,life gets in the way,and you just learn to roll with it.good luck!|`|i2wO5YClaa	Keep in mind that all pregancies are different.

You are NOT a bad person and you should NOT feel guilty. I have to tell you, pregnancy has been the worst experience of my life. The only joy I get is when I go to the doc & see how much he has grown on the ultrasounds, and feel his precious little kicks. Other than that I totally understand. I do not like being 20 some odd pounds heavier, I do not like being sick for months, and I do not like feeling like a foreigner in my own body. <br>  <br>  <br>  Will he be worth it? Absolutely. Would I trade him for the world. No way. Will I be getting pregnant again anytime soon on purpose? Hell no.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine recently feel pregnant about 2 years after her twins were born. She is married, and loves her boys. But she wasn't looking to have anymore, and was not happy about it. People would make comments to her like "Oh! You guys went for the girl and got it!". It would annoy her to death because she was just fine with the twin boys she already had. <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone (especially these foolish men who have the audacity to answer your question but will NEVER understand) make you feel bad about this. Take care of yourself, and this time round if you feel depressed, then get help a little sooner. Hopefully this pregnancy will be different for you. Good luck :-)
ebM6CxRQaa	How old is he? My son went through that phase until he was 2 months old (If I put something under his back it made him feel better he didn't like to lay flat) Now that he is older (8 months) he hates being changed because I force him to sit still when he prefers to crawl all around. A baby hating to be changed is normal.... Not making eye contact could be a problem. Is he only doing it when you change him? Then that's normal he is looking for somewhere else he rather go... does he just NEVER make eye contact...? If he is under a month or 2.. then that could be normal as well... but if he is over 2 months and never makes eye contact speak to your doctor GL|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	My son goes crazy when I change him too lol.

When they are little they won't necessarily look you in the face.  If your baby is older than a couple weeks and still not making any eye contact with you I would be consulting a dr!!  2nd, some baby's just do not like to be fussed with so changing them is a big inconvenience to them and they cry.  My son still has little tantrums when I change his diaper and change his clothes!  He's 2 months old and just now really starting to interact with Mommy and Daddy so we try to make lots of silly noises, give him kisses and blow on his tummy to make it fun.  Sometimes he smiles and is very good, other times he is just cranky and won't put up with it!!!|`|8scgAwJIaa	babies do cry when they get their diaper changed...how old is he...I call it reoccurrent childbirth(lol) they think they are reliving being born again(lol)  so him crying when u change him doesnt sound abnormal to me....him flaping his arms about....sometimes they squirm,quench, kick their legs and move their arms about when they're stomache hurts(gas)..this could be an issue...|`|AA10923353	Well, this is actually quite normal. I would suggest trying to get his attention when you change his diaper. Give his something small to play with. It always works with my nephew. Good luck!!|`|ww3eIZiXaa	How old?<br>  <br>  Try making diaper changing time a little more fun for him by singing, coo'ing, and using brightly colored toys to distract him.

AA12131544	We all have these ideas that we want to have a baby only at a certain age or once a certain salary range is met.  But it never happens that way...  Last week I was the first to say that I didn't want any kids.  Last week I was the first to say that I'm too selfish to put the needs of a child, even my own, in front of the needs of myself.  But last night, I tinkled on a plastic stick, and the results made all of those thoughts changed...  So today, instead of looking at the latest handbags online, I'm perusing the pregnancy q&a's of yahoo answers and watching the clock until my dr's apptmnt.  Last night my life changed for the better.  Am I a homeowner yet, no but luckily for me, Im already headed down that road.  Do I make six figures yet, no, but I make more then enough to support a child and myself if I had to do it alone.  But luckily I have a loving by/f of 4 years, who will be told tonight, that I have a lil bun in the oven.|`|84f0ba7accaa317cd18fdd263c9c50c1aa	Mema is wrong. I live in San Francisco and I can't afford to stay home because our mortgage is outrageous....whole family is here so don't want to leave either. You may never "feel" ready but in your heart you want to do more than be all about your self.|`|AA11613544	there will NEVER be the "ideal" time to have a baby.  but its best to wait until optimal circumstances  -you are with someone that you know will make a good parent.  -you are in a loving relationship with them  -you are financially stable as a couple, with money left over  -you are in a safe environment  -you find yourself thinking less "Me, Me, Me" and more about what is good for your future  -you and your partner have similar goals for the future and your children, and are capable of comprimising on things you disagree on  -you have the time for a child, or are willing to make it.  whats the point of having a kid if you will just have to pay someone else to care for it?|`|AA10093462	When you can financially stay home and care for it yourself instead of a daycare raising your baby.  To Blahblah, my daughter thought she would be fine with having me babysit while she works..........well, she cries every morning when she leaves her baby because she feels she is not raising her baby , her mother is.  YOUR WRONG "|`|AA11489247	When you are okay with the idea of not sleeping in late, or being ok with having to get up several times overnight.  Also, limited social activities, no alone time, no "extra" spending money.  Must be ready to always have unconditional love and no selfish behaviors on your part.  The more financially stable you are, the better.  Also make sure your relationship is on solid ground.|`|a3fa3bf6f9133b0510bfb6dd57822844aa	WHEN YOUR water BREAKS!
7uwCWhfuaa	Serena Raine<br>  <br>  LOVE IT<br>  |`|NWEJdpocaa	Serena Raine|`|Shp5riE6aa	Serena Raine, because it sounds Wiccian.  I also love rain, and I had a big crush on a girl named Serena when I was knee high to a grass hopper.|`|QVJ0CwNtaa	Selena Chloe. I know somebody called Selina. It's not my favourite name, but is still nice. I adore Chloe, very beautiful name.|`|iOrYfXF3aa	I like Serena Raine better|`|Ext89VDLaa	They're both terrible, people try TOO hard these days to be original. It just DOESN'T work.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I love Serena Raine...its really pretty and and different without being a weird name. Im not too keen on Chloe personally.|`|NwYwLdsNaa	The girl's name Serena \s(e)-re-na\ is pronounced ser-REE-nah, ser-RAY-nah. It is of Latin origin, and its meaning is "serene, calm". Used by Roman Christians. See also Sirena. Tennis player Serena Williams.<br>  <br>  The girl's name Raine \ra(i)-ne\, also used as boy's name Raine, is a variant of Raina, Rani (Hebrew, Sanskrit) and Regina (Latin), and the meaning of Raine is "she is singing; queen". <br>  <br>  The girl's name Chloe \ch-loe\ is pronounced KLOH-ee. It is of Greek origin, and its meaning is "blooming". From Khloe, originally used in the classical period to symbolize the fertility goddess Demeter. May be connected with Chloris. Appears in the Bible, and as a name in literature, especially in the tale of Daphnis and Chloe, set to music by Ravel. Adopted by Puritans in the 17th century. Candice Bergen has a daughter named Chloe. Actresses Chloe Webb, Chloe Sevigny<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|xsnTwIWFaa	I like Selena better for the first name. But I would put it with Raine.

Kv9RSyPcaa	This happened to me at 4 weeks and again at 8-10 weeks. The first time was very heavy for a day then stayed very light and brown for 1-2 more days. The second time it happened, around 8 weeks, it was much more heavy and red. The cramping and bleeding lasted for almost two weeks and would go from red to brown (like yours). Freaked me out!! The Doctor found a bleed from where the baby attached to the uterus. She said it was normal, but if I continued to bleed into my second trimester then I would have to see a "high risk" OB/GYN. I am now at 21 weeks and everything has been fine!! I have not bled since then. It can be normal, but it could also mean something is wrong. My doctor said to call and come straight in if it ever happened again. As your uterus stretches you will have some cramps and some sharp pains. If you are freaked out by it then call the doctor. Please don't think your over reacting!! This is your child and it's only normal to worry bout every little thing. Hope it helps.|`|AA11764194	Sounds familiar.. this is how my miscarriages happened.. clots and cramping are not good during early stages of pregnancy.. <br>  <br>  For your sake I hope everything is fine.. Goto your Doc<br>  <br>  Good luck.. |`|ByUS0k8waa	I would say your ok. Just do as the Dr says. I had my period til I was 4 months so I know how you must feel. I worried every month but as long as the baby looks good and the Dr says all things are good then your fine. Don't worry so much. No need to put more stress on yourself. Just stay off your feet and watch some tv or whatever. <br>  If its get worst or more cramping then I would go right back to the ER.|`|145211875f5adee8a13423ca577fcb7caa	I have had little bleeding w/ pregnancy before - at around 6 wks.  It only lasted 1-2 days & was very light.  I would talk to your doctor, but the reason why you may be bleeding & clotting a little now is because of the transvaginal ultrasound.  Sometimes after a doctor "checks you down there" it can cause minor bleeding.  Also, some cramping around 4-8 wks is normal as well.  Try not to get stressed out & relax your body for a few days.  The bleeding & cramping should stop by then, if not, call your doc.|`|mkveZfqOaa	When I was 8 weeks pregnant with my second, I bled and thought I was miscarrying, and of course I was on vacation in the middle of no where, turned out I was just bleeding.  I had no cramps or blood clots though and now have a happy 20 month old.  When I finally got to the doctor at 10 weeks they gave me the rhogam shot (i'm O-) and had no more bleeding the entire .  To be safe I would call your dr. and see if you can be seen today.  Good luck.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	u need to go the ER again, could be a miscarriage, i was passing clots that got a brighter red and i ended up have a miscarriage, not trying to scare u, but rather be safe than sorry, good luck and hope everything is ok|`|4d8yOK3iaa	If its in small amounts then it could be implantation bleeding. From week 5 to week 7 I had light brown bleeding with some clots in it, but they were very small. And I only needed one panty liner a day. I didn't cramp. But if you are bleeding heavier than that and the clots are big and you are severly cramping then go back to the ER. It may be best to go a head and go back to just make sure that you aren't about to mc. If everything is still good, then go back home and do as your doctor says until you can get in to see her. Good luck and I wish you the best.|`|XHeiEgF1aa	Cramping and red blood signals the start of a miscarriage. If it is happening, there is nothing you can do but lay down a lot and hope that whatever is wrong fixes itself, but you can't stop it if that is what it is. I would go back to the ER and tell them you are having cramping with red blood and clots. Let them do another scan and make sure your little one is okay.|`|mL07bInfaa	my best friend had bleeding and passed clots throughout her entire pregnancy, it turned out she had a very sensitive cervix and the slightest thing would make her bleed...she went on to carry full term and delivery a healthy 8 and a half pound baby boy, so try not to worry, not all bleeding means miscarrige, just keep an eye on it, and make sure you record everything with your doctor.|`|bx6OKLIbaa	When I was pregnant with my first  one I had brownish discharge up tp 2 weeks in my 5 month. Everything went ok because that was heart beat and I didn't have any cramping or pain. My doc says the same thing. May that was old blood or UTI(urinary tract inf). Baby was ok and born naturally. You have to be in contact with ur doc and see what she says. Stay off ur feet, take rest most of the time.<br>  Good luck....|`|KdqaGnlwaa	I dont know.... but blood clots??? That sounds like a miscarriage to me.. but you said no cramps? I would call your Dr and tell him/her that you are very worried and would feel better if you went in so they could check you... Good Luck.. I hope everything turns out fine!|`|AA10478146	I had a similar experience around 7 weeks.  The light cramping and brown blood is "normal".  Intense pain and red blood is not. |`|D0y3MwDcaa	i would GO TO THE ER NOW!!  you can mever be too safe with another life inside you!   if you love that beautiful BABY! not fetus!  you will go make sure everything is alright!!|`|5hvPoTBCaa	Go to the ER.  It could be a miscarriage.|`|0r3s9atRaa	possibly implantation bleeding. if its large amounts then u should get to the hospital ASAP because that could be a miscarriage.|`|Pw1fNIw2aa	No . I would go to the er and get checked .. Ive lost 2 pregnancies one early and one in my second trimester .. The one I lost early happened almost exactly as your explaining . It started by just bleeding no cramping .. Nothing wrong with baby .. Then the bleeding got worse and the color became bright like youve explained and then I started passing clots .. I went straight to the hospital to get checked after i started losing numerous clots of varied sizes and I ended up losing the baby and they had to do a D&C and remove the rest of the tissues that were in the uterus because I was losing alot of blood by the time I went to the hospital .. Please get yourself checked out and make sure you have someone with you so your not alone .. Best of luck to you and I pray your alright .. I would just definitely get checked out .. Like I said I experienced the same thing and I listened to lifting my feet and taking it easy but it didnt work out that way .. best of luck sweet heart .. i hope this helped just wanted to give you how i felt ive experienced it and if something horrible has happened please email me if you need support .. 
WhxlBEMAaa	I had 2 experiences, very similar to each other. For me it started 6-8 weeks into the pregnancy and I used crackers or toast to help me through it. I had to eat some right as I woke up to prevent being sick. Then I had to keep it handy throughout the day (it should really be called throughout-the-day sickness). It ended right around the end of the 4th month. It wasn't horrible, but it still was the most annoying part of the pregnancy. Thank God, vitamins didn't make me sicker. I think though that I should have taken a bit more Calcium, as all my teeth became weaker.|`|qicxk5GMaa	I was 6 wks exactly when I started getting sick.  I was constantly sick and actually lost 13 lbs in 3 weeks.  My doc took me off regular prenatals and told me to take 2 flinstone vitamins and some extra folic acid.  If you do get sick I recomend suckers (I like dum-dums), pretzles, animal crackers and gold fish crackers.  Hope you don't get sick... it REALLY sux!|`|HUQQzph2aa	I was around 6 weeks when I started to get morning sickness. I tired everything to prevent it, eating 6 small meals vs 3 large meals and nothing worked. <br>  <br>  Prenatal vitamins make some people sick so I do suggest taking them with food, that will help.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|ZZ6fJqCbaa	I'm 21 weeks and I still haven't had any morning sickness or cravings.  I don't think there is anything you can do to prevent it.  I also do not get sick from my vitamins.  |`|wXtqKFf8aa	I was sick from the moment I saw the positive and then it was down hill from there. I had morning sickness until 16 weeks. You never know, you might get it at 8 weeks. You can't prevent morning sickness, but with the prenatal vitamins, I bought some coated ones from Wal Mart. They are life savers. You don't taste them and they don't make you sick. GL.|`|qcHmUfWHaa	Well, I took prenatals and they made me have stomache cramps and (sorry, tmi) diarrhea. So, the Doc. recommended taking 2 Flintstone vitamins.<br>  <br>  I did have morning sickness (nauseous, but no vomiting) all day long when I was around 6 weeks pregnant, but it only lasted about a week. I drank Sprite, Orange juice, apple juice (lots of fluids) and ate saltine crackers. It went away and I haven't had it since.|`|0C9LhSAGaa	i started getting sick when i was 6 wks and 4 days preggo.. and it was baaaaddd.. i was hugging the toilet all day long and missed many days of work.. even threw up at work.. so bad.. it went away when i was about 14 weeks preggo.. and the prenatals i was taking prescribed by my doc would make me super sick.. i had to take over the counter natures bounty prenatals.. my doc said as long as i was taking prenatals its ok .. and i took expecta dha supplement with the prenatals.. and that worked for me.. i still take them its just easier on my tummy.. good luck and congrats on the pregnancy! if u do get morning sickness just try to eat something light and make sure u take ur prenatals thats super important especially in the first trimester to prevent defects.. good luck hun! it goes by sooo fast !|`|WbaSpiYpaa	It's funny you should ask this because today is the first time I've thrown up since I found out I was pregnant.  I started feeling really nauseas about 2-3 weeks ago, but just threw up today, and I'm almost 13 weeks along!  I think it can occur at any time.  For your sake though I hope you don't have it, and have smooth sailing through your whole pregnancy.  |`|Kv9RSyPcaa	I never experienced morning sickness and I am 21 weeks. I did get sick when I took a vitamin without eating. Just eat something before you take the vitamin, even if it is just a granola or cereal bar. |`|6V8ohTC8aa	mine didnt start until 9-10 weeks. It was never too bad though.. not as bad as some girls I guess.. but I still get sick every so often. I dont really know how to prevent it but no, the vitamins dont make me sick. |`|F1QvGBEUaa	I only got sick when I leaned over. Saltines and gingersnaps help. And whether or not prenatal vitamins make you sick depends on your body. If they do, try taking them before you go to bed.|`|P52KjwLtaa	Three months I did get sick...<br>  but... the prenatals made me sicker i didnt take them... but i took a regular childrens multivitamin the dr. recomended|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Somewhere around three months, my wife (and I ) began with morning sickness!  True.  Doctor said it's not all that uncommon...he called it sympathy sickness!  |`|ioZeveazaa	I started getting morning sickness and week six and it lasted for a month. So around the beginning of week 11 I didn't get it anymore really. I learned that eating consistently would help with the nausea because it helps to balance out your blood sugar. Prenatal vitamins made me sick so now I take them after my evening snack which is right before bed. I take it with a glass of milk and then when I fall asleep I don't feel sick. Good luck!
VY4LqfLpaa	you could always be one of the lucky ones...|`|T48smu01aa	well you could be the lucky one of not getting it but you could also end up getting in a couple weeks can't really tell everyone is different...I started around 8 weeks....good luck!|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	it could still show up i am 7 weeks and 3 days and it just kicked in it could be a lil while|`|AA11820380	i wish i was you, I'm 7w5d's pregnant and I got it 2 weeks ago, i had it so bad I was hospitalized for Hyperemesis.

Oh yeah, with my other child I got it for about a week in my 4th month and that was 13 years ago. Every pregnancy is diff.|`|CoiDQiTraa	No you are not past the morning sickness stage. Some people (like myself and my sister) never got morning sickness. Sometimes you get it later on in your pregnancy though.|`|wBpennsMaa	I had morning sickness from about 6 weeks to 13 weeks. Be glad! You are lucky!!|`|GwVWqqL4aa	Consider yourself lucky.  With my first child I was sick all of the time.  With this child I had no morning sickness.  Knock on wood and hope that it doesn't come in your third trimester.  Good luck! It can be perfectly normal to not have morning sickness, every woman is different, every pregnancy is different, even if the same woman is pregnant.  Don't let anyone tell you you are not doing something "normally".  I don't know how many people have told me I am 'really small' for 31 weeks.  This is coming from my classmates (in college) that have never been pregnant or had children.<br>  <br>  There is not a 'normal' pregnancy, but there are certain things that can be expected.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, no morning sickness is a blessing, you may just not be getting sick with this baby.  :)|`|lzUF22l0aa	you may not get morning sickness it doesnt happen to everyone be happy if you dont get it. but i did read in an article in parens magazine about 2 years ago when i was pregnant with my daughter that morning sickness hits hard  at around 9 or 10 weeks of pregnancy. Best of lcuk with everything!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You're just lucky. Not everyone gets sick. Just enjoy it and be thankful. You may get it later though.

One I had morning sickness for 5 months and one not at all.  The third was only for about eight weeks. So to each woman there is a different normal. Consider yourself lucky if you have none at all. Keep a snack handy and do not let your stomach get empty that helps.|`|ZI0scBdJaa	yes it is normal. just be happy, you really dont want to get morninq-<br>  sickness. i got it at 5 weeks til now 14 weeks and its horrible.. been<br>  in and out the hospital for itt.. its not fun. take your prenatals and<br>  vitamin B6 & B12. and you wont get it. but it is completely normal.<br>  <br>  usually morninq sickness can go up to 16 weeks. or throughout <br>  someones pregnancy<br>  <br>  congrats.|`|x0ZCaTjEaa	I went through my whole pregnancy without morning sickness (HURRAH!).  You can get morning sickness at any time through out your pregnancy, however it is most prominent in the first 14 weeks.  My guess is you are one of the lucky ones that will not have to deal with it!|`|8lYchdB9aa	Every pregnancy is different.

rqKRZOCVaa	Ask them what they are worried of? Remind him you raised him and he's alive and ok... whats wrong with having your grandchild over who not to mention obviously wouldn't be here today if it weren't for you. <br>  <br>  THank you Zeena my son stayed at my sisters house who has children herself for the whole night when he was 7 months and was a perfect angel. Hubby and I got a taxi out for the night and had a blast and my sister and her kids got to have some one on one time with my son. "Family" not strangers house. |`|AA11731115	Two years old is too young to be sleeping over at someone's  -even grandparent's- place overnight without parents. Most kids have their first 'overnight' away from mom and dad around age 7 or 8.[Some parents never let their kids go overnight; depending on the culture.]<br>  <br>  Unless there is an emergency where neither parent is able to care for the boy, it's doubtful you will be able to convince parents to let their child go overnight if they don't want him to.<br>  Hassling them about it won't help and will probably stress your relationship, so I'd let it go. <br>  <br>  Parents know their kids best, and your son probably knows that his toddler would not be a pleasant overnight guest - he's probably trying to save you a night of screaming and save himself having to drive out there at 3am. Not to mention a sleepless night of worry and guilt for mom and dad.|`|mn68HtQ1aa	There is probably nothing that you SHOULD do. Your son has his reasons, which are valid to him, that probably have nothing to do with you or your parenting.<br>  Give it time and just offer from time to time. Perhaps let him take a night out while you keep the child for a few hours. Warm him up to it.<br>  Don't take it personally though.|`|Uti4prQkaa	let your son sleep over also |`|cVD3zEKfaa	Ask him very nicely.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	Just ask him if he will let the little one sleep over.<br>  <br>  lucy_shy, two years is not too young to sleep over.My youngest slept over at his Grandparents house at 6 months for the first time and was perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  My nieces and nephews all started at 12 months and all were perfectly fine.
AA10811984	Hi! <br>  <br>  I had an IUI on Nov 13th. I had mild cramping the night of the rx. All this week I have had a funny feeling in my stomach & lower abdomen. My husband says it is nerves I hope it is implantation. I am 6 dpo and have a blood test tomorrow to see if there is progesterone in my blood (meaning I did ovulate) then I have to wait a week until the 27th to do the blood test. I hope our suspicions are true and we are pregnant!!!! Was this your first time doing IUI. It was mine. Good Luck!!!!|`|3aV4lcCqaa	i personally havent had IUI but i have read about it as that was going to be our next step before IVF, and i have read that you can be crampy and have abdominal pain from it.

kiznZMn5aa	It is becoming more common among a generation that doesn't consider oral to be actual sex, just more of a casual thing like making out. However, common is not at all the same as acceptable and it is your job as a parent to 1) enforce the rules and 2) help her develop morally. You need to talk to her about a variety of things - how far as she gone? If she is sexually active, you guys need to decide whether she needs to be taking birth control pills and make sure she is seeing the doctor regularly for gyn exams & STD tests. Does she understand about using protection and safe sex - she can still get STDs from oral sex. You need to talk to her about how this info makes you feel - I'm assuming you are very disappointed in her and more than a little disgusted. You obviously can't trust her friends parents like you thought you could - if this was going on, what else goes on at friends houses that you don't know about? Drugs? Drinking?  |`|4cetsTRZaa	Take your girl to a homless shealter for teen moms.<br>  Show her what this nasty behavior can lead to.<br>  Tell there is many great reasons to wait till she is married for these kinds of affection but only if the recepeant is one you she loves and loves her back. Then these acts can be fun and meaningful.<br>  Also talk with the parents they are most likly Not good patlrents and want to be there kids friends not there parents.

How did you find this out? In my neck of the woods this is not normal nor acceptible! Adults can get up to what they want in their own time... children? No way!

She will probably tell you no i know they dont but tell her do you live with them do you sleep with them are you aound the exactly every second of their life? Did you see them get a full test where you in the room? then i know your/ her anwser would be no. Come on what she was doing it is an AIDS pool waiting to happen...i am sorry to hear about your daughter and i hope she relses what she did.....also what i said you need to make sure you enforce those rules too....otherwise she will think she can walk all over you...and you dont need that...<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck.... |`|1aREhnZXaa	It is an adage men lie about sex.  They lie about sex they do have and lie about sex they don't have.  I suspect the story got around from the boys boasting about their (imaginary) sexual  conquests.  It probably didn't happen.  Don't worry about it,  Just empower your daughter to  make the appropriate choices when it comes to her sexuality|`|h7YMKNI4aa	 I'm 16 too, and this is totally TOTALLY unheard of where I'm from.<br>  (and yes, i do go to parties!) girls and boys go off in pairs to do this sort of thing occasionaly I'm afraid, yes.. but this specific situation DOES NOT happen with anyone I know.|`|oivrzkeqaa	No, this is not common...it's disgusting.

KICQQxLxaa	If she is eating table food just fine, scrap the stage 3 stuff.  There is no reason she needs to eat the stage 3 stuff....it is just a gimmick that the baby food companies came up with.<br>  <br>  Keep giving her table foods.  Steamed or roasted veggies are another excellent self feeding food.  <br>  It is great that she likes table food and can self feed.  I would ditch all baby food and let her eat what you guys are eating.<br>  <br>  WOW...I can't believe parents of toddlers are still giving their children baby food....|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	My 14 month old is the same way. She likes big girl food (table food), but hasn't quite taken to stage three. A couple of nights ago, my MIL made some soup (it was more like stew) with mixed veggies that were chopped up in to tiny pieces. (I think, nutritionally, for adults they are almost worthless when they are that tiny. However, for my in-laws to eat a whole meal of just veggies is a big thing.) I gave my daughter little chunks of carrot and some potatoes that my MIL cut up to put in and she thought it was great. Go figure. <br>  <br>  We're not too worried. After we move and we're settled in (we're moving on Wednesday) we're going to start giving her more big girl food and start to wean her off of her baby food. For now, we just give her more of the stage two. (For breakfast, baby cereal, one jar of either fruit or veggies and two jars of the other; Lunch, cereal and one jar of each; for a snack, one jar of each; for dinner, cereal and the opposite of what she had for breakfast.) She also gets all of the milk she wants too, as I plan on letting her self wean from that.|`|VgTQYrn5aa	If she's eating table food don't worry.  She has probably gotten used to the taste of real food and doesn't like the baby food taste/texture anymore.  When my son was 10 months we gave up baby food altogether.  They can eat yogurt, applesauce, cheese, toddler crackers, cheerios, rice, soft cooked veggies, so much other stuff there is no need to eat baby food anymore.  |`|eciMwNB3aa	my baby is just over a year now and only just started stage 3.  dont rush her as some babies just prefer smooth food.  you dont want her to have 'food issues' so just give her what she will eat and every now and then offer her stage 3 to see how she goes.  <br>  <br>  my little one still gags, but when she does i give her the next spoon of yogurt then go back to the stew, then back to the yogurt and so on and so on... <br>  <br>  she will get used to it, but she is still very young.  Good luck!!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Just give her table food.  <br>  <br>  For veggies just steam/cook them and chop them up and let her eat that, same with meat.  My son is 10.5 months and I usually just give him some of whatever we eat for dinner along with veggies.  <br>  <br>  She probably doesn't want that baby food anymore, think about it, would you want it after having real yummy food?|`|9eno55hCaa	It might be the texture she doesnt like.  My lil brother did that with baby food but he would eat actual table food.  I think theres gotta be something with the texture that they prefer when they do that.<br>  <br>  
Ep0CpwDbaa	First you need to understand that the bullies often act that way because they are bullied as well, whether by older siblings, parents, etc.<br>  <br>  When you stand up to a bully, the bully starts to think about what if someone would stand up to the person who bullies him. He sees that it's not right to bully people because it's the same way he gets bullied himself.<br>  <br>  In your paragraph you can also write about how they feel insecure, and by realizing that their methods of trying to torment others aren't working, they stop.|`|yV8fog7Paa	Do you have a LITTLE common sense? Use your brain.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	It puts them on the defense instead of the offense.  Makes them feel 'bullied' in a way.  Bullies are just weak punks.|`|22xZQoEZaa	it doesnt u just get punched
5nJm80dxaa	I'm not to sure if they sell an actual fertitliy pill - I went through fertility and looked into so many different methods.  My dr. advised me not to stay on any type of conception pills b/c a woman should only take fertility pills at least 6 times or less in her lifetime b/c they may cause ovarian cancer somewhere down the line.  I had major issues conceiving but I changed my diet somewhat and I looked online for vitamin supplements that helped with fertility processes.<br>  <br>  But I got pregnant when I was not trying or thinking about it.

AA12130187	Your dog is YOURS.  YOUR Property.  Same goes for your neighbor's dog...HIS property.  They are considered "property" and not like children.      His dog was in your yard without your knowledge or consent.  No contractual agreement to the "stud service" was made either written or verbal.  Your neighbor will unfortunately have the say in what happens with the puppies since he has the ***** (female dog).  Now remember he may also have had stud service from another dog, not just your dog, and although there are services that offer testing as far as genetics go....I don't know how far you'll get with that in finding out if your dog was the sire of the pups.  However, because no contract was signed and they mated "without permission," the puppies will ultimately be property of the person who owns their mother.|`|bd88d499ad5e65ac146f90e4373dbd2caa	I really don't think the laws for humans cover doggies    and what exactly is a "female male husky"|`|30560d8efd07854e889d4af2560f7c00aa	animal control laws are different in all states if you are being responsible and paying half of the vet bills to make sure the pregnant dog is taken care of then yes i would say that half of the litter would be yours but its not a for sure answer contact your local animal control officer and see what the laws are and what you may do to get what is yours.

60e687a1022a8549cc7b3d2d3d7cabafaa	First of all CALM DOWN!!!The baby will be fine!you can not order the father to parenting classes,a judge has to do that.I think he fed the baby because it was crying and men just don't know what to do so they stick a bottle in the kids mouth because that's all they know how to fix the situation.You need to supervise dad and baby for awhile to show him some tips on how to make the baby comfortable,you shouldn't leave your baby with someone who doesn't have a clue on how to care for a 5 month old baby.If you have a court order for him to have visitation then you need to have it modified for him to be supervised by his mother or someone who knows how to care for the baby.If you have to write things on a piece of paper for now for him to use as reference or reminder of what he is suppose to do it will help him to remember all the oz.s and times to feed the baby and that will help you feel at ease.He's not used to doing this so give him a break,it's easy for moms but dads just don't get it and they have their own set of parenting skills that have nothing to do with the right or proper way to care for a child,they do the things that they think will make the child stop crying and make baby happy the fastest.That's why we have the baby's in the first place,BECAUSE MEN CAN'T HANDLE IT!!!!!!|`|ba30c9b84725091dfcbb402b4a73f45aaa	about ordering him to take a class, probably not.    Now relax, your baby won't drink all the stuff if he doesn't want to.  If they were too much, he'd just throwup.      Babies do get growth spurts where they all of a sudden eat a lot more for like a week or so.  All is normal.   Maybe YOU need to get some parenting classes too.|`|ef3b2dfffb0527747374fa615d0b4595aa	Just be happy he wants something to do with his son.  As long as he in not hurting the child be happy.  He will learn not to feed him so much when the child throws up on him,  remember to encourage him, not degrade him.  He is important to your boys future.     You can't force someone to do anything, but you can encourage and learn TOGETHER for your childs sake.  I'm sure there is a lot you could both learn...|`|01fb4ea5f061b018eb539d25876b9021aa	so he is being a bad dad cause he fed his kid? you are crazy lady.|`|399d5c6ef6e2cfd92be7496c242d2a50aa	were you guys married?  I know in minnesota if the parents are not married the mother has full legal an physical custody of the child.  I am in the same situation.  If you want to force him to take parenting classes i imagine you would have to go to court.  I have simply exercised my rights and withheld the children from him, he can only see them when supervised by family members.  My situation is a little more extreme though.|`|ab16e3d01781a6ba7c6f855571d16972aa	Probably not, feeding him too much might seem like bad parenting to you, but to the courts its considered "new father" tial and error.  Maybe try writing eveything on a piece of paper and put post-its on the bottles.  or if he is sick don't let your son out of the house.  My stepsons sick we dont let him out of the house becaue the biomom doesnt understand soup, and keep him warm and in bed watching tv.   Last time she took him to the bech on a foggy day in a convertible!!!!!!!  HEe hd a cough cold and a fever,|`|AA12113598	Actually- i take it this is your first child for you to be protective- and you have no clue either if not you would no when your child is hungry- if he still had diarrhea or nausea he would not want to eat- If he is keeping everything down-then resuming his diet is normal- geesh woman-if he had spit it up- then he probably wouldn't have given him his bottle. As your child gets older- and your child has the flu- your child will say im hungry-which means he is better- learn your child-it seems he did the right thing. (resuming a normal diet slowly... Did your son throw up after drinking the formula-no probably not-you left the bottles just in case....HELLO you would of done the same thing-
c820a2659e09230b1aa3b1de1fc5a1b3aa	Sounds to me like your just experinceing a case of over working your self when your body wants rest...I got like that when i was pregnant with my first child and then i started spotting and they said i needed to relax and get lots of rest..|`|AA10361505	I'm 39 weeks pregnant and had some of these symptoms alot.  My OB said it was my bodys way of telling me that I was over working myself and I needed to rest. Or you could be stressed out about something.  Do what your doc says.  He knows what he is talking about.  Best wishes and good luck!|`|4f863d0c12d259eac50b98948bd3f0b2aa	I never had this, but have known people that have. Are you working to much? Do you work long hours? stressful job? Has it been very hot where you are? Do you have allergies? All these things can trigger a fainting spell. Your body will be protecting your unborn child and so unfortunately you will suffer the consequences. Rest and a little time out sounds like a great idea. Don';t think that your Dr was brushing you off, his advice sounds good. If it does happen again then definately check in to the ER. I think you'll find though that your baby will be fine. Hope you feel better soon. good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.|`|1bfd273973d50b64d8bda9e8e8d13e15aa	Yes this sounds very normal, don't forget your body as well as those good hormones are going crazy in you right now.  I am assuming you already took the glucose test, if you haven't make sure you do just to rule out Gestational Diabetes (I had it) because of the spots in your field of vision.  I would really take it easy, and dont drive if you are feeling anything like this.  Talk to they OB and let them know in person.    Good Luck :-)|`|AA11454309	I agree with first answer. I sometimes have those same symptoms, I have chalked mine up to the unbearable heat because I didn't expirience them with my first pregnancy which was a winter one. This pregnancy however I have seen spots quite a few times. Take your temperature though, because if something really is wrong that is going to be a good indicator, also remember you know your body better than ANYONE so if you really feel that your docs aren't taking you seriously, head on over to the ER and have the baby checked out.     Recently I went in because I couldn't breath, the doc said it was asthma, I haven't ever been diagnosed with Asthma, I told them I had chronic bronchitis, still they didn't give me the antibiotics  I usually recieve, I went back and saw another dr. just 4 days later, yep bronchitis, if I hadn't gone back in I could have gotten pneumonia and endangered me and my baby. You have to do what you FEEL is right! Good Luck!|`|c71798825b466427b6554dbe635dfb81aa	Heart palpitations happen a lot during pregnancy.  I remember having quite a few of them around the 30-32 week point.  The thing that concerns me is the "spots" in your vision.  As you probably know, that can be a symptom of preeclampsia, which can be dangerous for both you and the baby.   (I'm sure you've been educated about the dangers of preeclampsia and high blood pressure during pregnancy.)  I'm surprised that your doctor would not be more attentive after you told him/her that you saw spots.    I would make an appointment with your doctor to have your blood pressure taken as soon as you can.  And if you truly feel like your doctor blew you off, call again or go ahead to the ER if it will make you feel better.  You and your baby deserve to be listened to, and there's no reason to put yourself through needless worry.  Good luck, and I hope you're feeling better soon.|`|eb4229f27dfac6b7a4ea66347d2e97a6aa	sounds like a panic attack... talk to your ob and see what he suggests

I mean is there something there that is causing this?    Also, if your OBGYN isn't seeing you when you have a concern like this, and they are saying there is nothing that they can do, then I would find a new one asap.    If you can't go to them for reassurance after what you have been through then they are not the doctor you need to see.

You aren't paying child support either.      A judge would not grant that.  There is no law regarding step parents.  Remember as well that since you are getting divorced, you are no longer going to be that boy's step parent either.  That is even less legal right now.     You may want to consider maybe volunteering at some kind of center that serves autistic children.  It may help you ease the pain of things.    I'd worry about your divorce from the bastard.  He sounds like a complete jerk.   You also have to move out soon and you should worry about that.    You 12 month old son will be able to visit with his father provided he pays child support.|`|6ce18dd6d294fd9e03848be7e74fdac8aa	i am pretty sure u could get some right with your step son.. just remember to keep the kids 1st...no matter what u do.. i went through the same thing but mine were 5months and 2 and now i live on my own and keep the kids.. and there dad comes around when he please's but i dont force them on him because i feel if he dont want them i am not going to force him to .. but he gets them like 5 days a month so they still no there dad but they also no who is there for them and who isnt... u no what i mean .. but i cant force them on him because i tryed that once and he would just find a babysitter for them and he would go party and i would have had no prob.. with that is they were desecnt ppl but they were nasty ppl.. and i dont like my kids bounced around to ppl i dont no and they dont.. good luck just stay strong and keep the kids 1st..
9c4d8f1f2632d60c0a3ac95447e2473aaa	The only way for you to know if you are ovulating is to take your basal body temp each morn, same time and before you get up. You should see a pattern in temps that leads up to and after ovulation. You can get the basal thermometer at Wal-Mart for about 8 dollars. I use a wonderful FREE website called Fertilityfriend.com...it graphs your temps for you, keeps track of your fertility signs, tells you when you ovulate and also tells you if there is an implantation dip in your temps. You can also use Ovulation prediction kits, but they only measure your LH surge and give you a ball park time for ovulation...they do not pin point it. Oh, and it is possible to be ovulating while you do not have your period, just like it is possible to have a period and not ovulate.|`|AA10644766	To get pregnant you must have sex on a day that your eggs are being released.    After the 3rd day from the day that menses started put a thermometer into your mouth and check your body temperature every morning before you start turning in bed. The best time is at about 4 a.m. Maintain a chart. You will find that on one day the body temperature drops from 1/2 degree to one degree. This is the day that your eggs are being released. If you want to get pregnant this is the day that you must have sex. Tell your husband to ejaculate on his inward thrust so that the sperms will shoot deep inside.    After having sex you must stay in bed for about 30 mins with your knees bent up with a pillow under your buttocks so that the sperms will not pour out - to enable them to travel up.     Get your husband to save his sperms in the testacles for at least 3 days before sex to enable them to mature well to do their job.|`|493628e57db9bea90ef201d589c0b0cfaa	Just keep trying.

If you are in a healthy pregnancy is fine to have sex. But if you are in a high risk pregnancy no sex is the way to go to prevent  early pregnacy or miscarriage. Which usually means no penetration.

She will be fine and if she is concerned she should talk to her dr.|`|ea32e567fa995ad51b2fd81aaf40e6e4aa	Early in your pregnancy your blood will be tested to determine your blood type and your Rh status  that is, whether you have the Rh (Rhesus) factor, a protein that most people have on the surface of their red blood cells. If you do have the Rh factor, as most people do, your status is Rh-positive. (About 85 percent of Caucasians are Rh-positive, as are 90 to 95 percent of African Americans and 98 to 99 percent of Asian Americans.) If you don't have it, you're Rh-negative, and you'll need to take certain precautions during your pregnancy.    If you're Rh-negative, there's a good chance that your blood is incompatible with your baby's blood, which is likely to be Rh-positive. You probably won't know this for sure until the baby is born, but in most cases you have to assume it, just to be safe.    Being "Rh-incompatible" isn't likely to harm you or your baby during this pregnancy, if it's your first. But if your baby's blood leaks into yours (as it can at certain times during pregnancy and at birth), your immune system will start to produce antibodies against this Rh-positive blood. If that happens, you'll become "Rh-sensitized"  and the next time you're pregnant with an Rh-positive baby, those antibodies may attack your baby's blood. Fortunately, you can avoid becoming Rh-sensitized by getting an injection of a drug called Rh immune globulin whenever there's a chance that your blood has been exposed to your baby's blood.    If you're Rh-negative and you've been pregnant before but didn't get this shot, another routine prenatal blood test will tell you whether you already have the antibodies that attack Rh-positive blood. (You could have them even if you miscarried the baby, had an abortion, or had an ectopic pregnancy.) If you do have the antibodies, it's too late to get the shot, and if your baby is Rh-positive, he's likely to have some problems. If you don't have the antibodies, then the shot will protect you from developing them.
zVZgYEjMaa	It happened to my mom.  They adopted me.  It took ten months for the adoption to finalize.  My sister was born seven months after the adoption was final.  (The case worker even came to my mom to ask her if she wanted to give me back.  She did not.)    ETA: Since this was decades ago, my mom never took any fertility treatments.|`|BH9MoOQAaa	I wouldn't say quite often, but I would say often enough to drive infertile people nuts because of the whole "just relax and you'll get pregnant" type comments.  Just enough times to get infertile people ranting on their blogs from comments about how they should "Just adopt" so then they could get pregnant.  And just enough times to get some of those same bloggers who ranted to end up being that person and having to eat crow.|`|Alyvp37Maa	Yes, but it is not the norm.    I do not advise on adopting so you can get pregnant.  Rather take a long vacation with your spouse.  Relax and forget about baby making.  Just enjoy the love and company of your spouse.  Let go of those stress hormones that so often come from frustration of not being able to get pregnant.    Adoption is very complicated.  Part of me has always resented getting pregnant so soon after adopting.  I wish i could have had more alone time with my first baby.  Again i would not advise doing it.  I wouldn't want the adopted child to feel like a consolation prize or second best.    Throwing tons of baby dust your way:)      |`|aRn6paEfaa	It has happened.  I remember seeing stats on it, and it wasn't all that common, but it does happen.  But I'd say it happens often enough that it's yet another really good reason NOT to adopt because you can't have your own.  Not only is it not fair to your adopted child to be given your hole to fill, but it would be pretty crappy for them to then become irrelevant because you had a "real" kid.  (I'm not speaking from experience, but reiterating the feelings expressed to me by more than one adoptee who has been in that position.)  If you are not able to have kids, you'll need to grieve your losses, get therapy, and become happy on your own.  You should become an adoptive parent because you want to parent an adopted child, not because you want "a" child.  Not to mention, adoption is for kids who need new homes, not a way to find kids for people who can't have them.|`|Faw2iBtfaa	Yes, I did. It was a surprise, but it works out for our family.

There are some people who just have love in their heart for children, no matter how they came to be! I feel no different about my step-children, adopted children or bio child.

Also, the people who have adopted 10-15 years ago did not have the same type of fertility drugs. Its more possible with new medical findings, they can have a baby on their own. |`|C1eHfhrHaa	This happened to the parents of a friend of mine.

Some people even cancel the adoption because of it :(|`|uxqz39fYaa	This happens quite often.    The pressure is off, and you relax and stop being so hard on yourself.

It's not unusual  so dont pressure yourself. You are just more mature than them. I am 12 and there are a lot of girls at my school who wear make-up and the only kind I would have to wear is naturally (which I only wore 2x this year). I like to talk to adults too and I find there conversations rather interesting. Just think of this...their immaturity are going to lead them to bad things, yet you being more mature and conscious will guide you to things that are good in life.|`|AA11949401	Girl, you're not alone be proud of who you are.

fPFXJr3eaa	I just don't agree with it.  Its not ethcially or morally right and no thoughts are ever given to the child who will be the product of such a callous arrangement.  Surrogacy is just another form of materialism and worse, child buying therefore traffiking.  It should be illegal.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	http://sonofasurrogate.tripod.com/    The best people to learn from are those who are living it.  This is a blog written by a young man who is the product of a surrogacy.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	Without voicing an opinion on how I personally feel about surrogates, I want to say that in the gay culture, surrogacy is seen as a lifeline.  Gay men have very few options to parenting and use surrogacy frequently as an option.  It is advertised in gay magazines like The Advocate.  There are gay documentaries about gay men using a surrogate.    The "want" to parent is there whether you are gay, straight, male, or female.  Whether I agree is irrelevant because I realize that it is a main option for gay men.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	I believe a great surrogate knows the feelings involved yet the sacrifice being made is for the good of the future of the child. It is not easy which is why nowadays the agreements are pretty iron clad and with good reason. Feelings are hard to quiet. If I were to ever be in said situation I would give up the child knowing it was meant to be.|`|AA11987492	It is sick, exploitative, and classist.    No one is thinking about the child. Whether or not the surrogate is genetically related to the child, the child knows the surrogate as "mother" There IS bonding in the womb. The child knows her voice, her smell, her heartbeat, the taste of her food (tastes can enter the amniotic fluid, AND breast milk), the sway of her walk, her moods, ect. It is now known that when a baby is born, the baby does not separate himself as being a separate person from his mother. She is all he knows and all he wants. In his mind, SHE is his mother, whether he came from her DNA or not. When a baby is separated from his mother, a "Primal Wound" occurs. (Read the book called "The Primal Wound" by Nancy Verrier, she is an adoptive mother, btw...) This is not a fair to the child.     I am sick and tired of all these people saying that you are giving a "gift" to an infertile couple. CHILDREN ARE NOT "GIFTS" TO BE GIVEN AWAY!!!! THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT NEEDS TO BE RESPECTED! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF YOU WERE GIVEN AS A GIFT?!?!?!?! Also, gifts are "possessions". People are no longer possessions since we abolished slavery.    This is a GREAT blog about a man that is the result of surrogacy.    http://sonofasurrogate.tripod.com/    Children are not born "blank slates" and mothers can not just be substituted. It is NOT fair to the child to screw with their head like that for YOUR happiness. As a parent, your CHILDS needs come first, and and by hiring a surrogate, you are putting YOUR needs and desires first, right off the bat. To me, this SCREAMS "unfit" It is NOT about you! I am sorry for your infertility, it must be aweful. I get that, I really do. But children are not responsible for their parents happiness. It is NOT fair to put that on their shoulders.    Not only is this wrong for the child, but it is bad for the surrogate as well. How many rich, white women do you see carrying a middle class hispanic womans baby????? My point exactly! It is most often lower, working class women OR women in other countries thare trying to put food on the table for their other children. It is SICK! Prostitution is illegal and frowned upon, but women can rent out their uteruses and it is considered "noble" it makes no sense!    Personal autonomy is also completely taken advantage of. These women are not allowed to terminate, have to eat nad drink certain things, and go to incredible length, just so that they can provide for their family.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Surrogacy should not be legal.  To become pregnant with intent to abandon the child should be a crime.  To solicit a woman to become pregnant with the intent to remove the child from her custody should be a crime.  It doesn't matter if it's her biological child or theirs.  It should not be allowed to happen.  No child deserves to enter the world in this fashion.|`|NYBo35zjaa	These poor families looking to have a baby are desperate and I feel that any person the agrees to be a surrogate and tries to take the child back is so wrong.  You are right the entered knowing this, don't you think the poor woman that is unable to carry her own child feels bad enough not being the one to this to add further torture this person now after being financially supported by these people decides they don't have to honor their promise, it beyond cruel and their just scam artist|`|LgMoGUoqaa	When a person enters into the contract (verbal or written) she knows that at the end of the pregnancy she will have to give up the baby.  It is such a hard call simply because the surrogate mother is bonding with this child all 9 months.  It is such a hard call.  Being a mother myself, I couldn't see carrying a child for 9 months then having to give it up.  I just may be selfish.  It takes a very special lady to be able to endure all that pain for someone else to have a baby. My hat goes off to her.  As far as rights, I say the surrogate knew what she was getting into when she decided to become  a surrogate so no she has no rights either way.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	before i had my own i wanted to become a surrogate.

They will, of course, have a strong emotional connection to the child due to the pregnancy, but they will not have a biological right to the child. I know a surrogate mother who was not a biological parent, but the biological parents agreed to name her the child's guardian in the event something should happen to them. That, in my opinion, is an ideal situation.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Well okay, although surrogate mothers often are not the biological mothers, they often have no right to the child.    However, there are egg donors who women have a pregnancy of a child that is not biologically theres, they form attachment.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	I don't believe in using women as incubators at all.    But if a woman donates her egg, she still has a right to that child.|`|q7W1SSgsaa	It's not up to me to judge another's decisions or actions, however I do feel surrogacy is unwarranted and unnecessary when their are so many children who need to be fostered or adopted.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Personally I find the entire idea of having someone carry a child just so it can be one of yours genetic material to be very distasteful. More than that.. It's egoist by ALL parties.. and it's a shame it cannot be stopped. But hey there was no stopping that woman that just added 8 to single mother household of 6 people are very selfish.      let the thumbs rain down! it is my opinion and I'm entitled to it!|`|AA11795652	Good question.  I think the "law" should quickly decide this.  If it wasn't for the surrogate, there would be no baby, so this is really tough.  But if it wasn't for the biological parents, there would be no baby either.  A friend had asked me if I consider being her surrogate in the future.  I told her that I would have to go through tons of counseling (with and without her) and that I bond with my babies immediately (I have two kids) and that she would be stuck with me in her life for the rest of her life because I would have a bond with her baby even if it wasn't my DNA but because I carried it.  I really would want a professional to help me determine that I would be capable of handing over the baby that was in my tummy over to the biological parents once it was born.|`|AA12243380	Typically a surrogate situation has an iron clad contract and for legal reasons the surrogate is not the same person as the egg donor if an egg donor is required.    I do not believe a surrogate has a legal right to the baby or babies and I believe that the parents of the baby are the people who were the original parents who entered into the contract as the designated parents.
acbdc89b1220bab8f62f51392d9cb9edaa	Check his diet, how much sugar is he consuming?  Have you considered putting him into a martial arts class or dance class to work off some excess energy?    I recommend the dance class, since at 5 this is the only chance you'll probably get to get him into such a class, and they are way cheaper.    By the way, you don't want him having less energy, there is already a major obesity problem in Western countries with their children and slowing him down in such a way would only make him yet another statistic.  Redirect the energy!  Don't reduce.|`|4062ae39609e30dd64c24aec727b7485aa	I have met many children who act this way, and most of the time it is because the parents give in to the child's demands after the child getting hateful and having fits instead of the parents being the parents. This just gave the message to the child that he is the boss and he rules the house. The only way to fix this is to put the foot down, be consistent in discipline and DO NOT GIVE IN! Let him throw his fit IN HIS ROOM! When he sees that he is the child and not the parent it will change. However, there is also a condition that is called ADHD, and can be corrected with medication, though I would advise any parent very strongly to try other corrective methods, like counseling, and if medication is required DO NOT ACCEPT Ritalin. Ritalin makes things worse and can actually damage the brain, the medication was made for adults who have ADD and this product has still not been balanced for a child to take safely.|`|d2583e95d4d4519b876d402f5e6dc9b6aa	you need to etheir discipline him very well atart taking things away and also atop giving into things and all and he might need counseling i would try to make it out without medicines and all because i dont believe in that you just hafe to make disccipline if he is bad in school then come home snack home work and thenbath then supper and straight to bed no play time or make him do double chores and if he dont do it tell him he is going to get counseling and go to more classes and start showing it take toys out toys out room and put back when he is doing better and all then he will learn that it is not a joke and all.|`|0ced00fad4c5cf9ea24f44022522d3f1aa	Five year old boys need time to work off their extra energy.

All he would do is run around and say get me this get me that!  The best way I found to stop this is discipline, i don't mean break out the ruler and the club I just mean "Sit on the stairs for 5 minutes and think about what you've done" (that's if you have stairs) or my favorite "1.......2........2 1/2......3!  To your room now!"  Now you may not find the "Sit on the stairs for 5 minutes" one that effective but if he does it again make it 10 minutes then 15 never more than 20, after that if he STILL misbehaves then try a different measure of punishment but i doubt he will keep on going...as for the energy have some quite time but not 24/7 schedule in some play time also.

e476LQV3aa	Yo tambien perdi un bebe en el mes de marzo, fue un aborto espontaneo y el medico me recomendo cuidarme  por lo menos tres meses antes de volver a quedar embarazada.    Lo del metodo anticonceptivo depende de cuanto tiempo quieres esperar para volver a intentar un embarazo.  Si como yo quieres intentarlo tan pronto el medico te de luz verde pues debes utilizar profilacticos, porque si usas pastillas, parches o cualquiera otra de esas cosas tendras que esperar un periodo de tiempo despues de que dejes de usarlo para poder salir embarazada.    Si tomas anticonceptivos orales debes esperar por lo menos tres meses antes de volver a intentar un embarazo.    Lamento mucho la perdida de tu bebe, se lo dificil que es pero si Dios quiere la proxima vez lo lograremos.    Suerte|`|e0c114995c84b40730813ae9b80d8fdaaa	Lamento mucho tu perdida, a mi me pas y la verdad todava duele mucho as que no se que consejo darte.

Para superarlo necesitas mucho, pero mucho tiempo para sanar esa herida que te deja un aborto.     Si en verdad ya no quieres tener ms bbs yo te recomiendo un DIU, ya que un condon por muy bueno que sea puede ser que se rompa, que este defectuoso, que a tu pareja con la emocin se le olvide ponerselo desde un inicio, etc, etc, etc.... mejor utiliza este metodo, no es para nada agresivo, no te acarrea ningun problema si lo utilizas tal cual te lo indique tu medico, que en primera instancia es l quien debe de recomendar un metodo anticonceptivo acorde a ti.     Pidele al tiempo te sane por completo y rapido para que no sigas sufriendo ni cargando esa responsabilidad en tus hombros.    Mucho exito y saludos.

Decide that you will not entrust this responsibility to anybody else ever.  And resolve NEVER to allow the possibility of a sexually intimate encounter with anyone, EVER, not even just once, until you have spoken to a gp and implemented an acceptable contraceptive measure AND informed yourself regarding sexually transmitted diseases (safe and unsafe practices to guard against catching them and also  how to discreetly  check your partner's sexual health BEFORE you do ANYTHING. Know the signs, know what to look for).  This also means avoiding situations where affection could escalate into something more before you have readied yourself for the responsibility that comes with it.    I would guess that 75% of people who say they became pregnant "accidentally" are either uninformed / wrongly informed / naive beforehand or else simply lazy.  Take charge of your life and what you want for yourself and you will never have to deal with this problem.  Its up to YOU.|`|0ab1f0b6985ccb73fe54140fce6f47baaa	I got pregnant at the age of 15.  I WAS one of those people who thought that the pull out method worked.  Oh, what we learn from our mistakes.  Well, my mother knew before I did because of the way I was acting.  I told my boyfriend at the time that I thought I  was pregnant and he just picked me up and threw me off of the bed.  I took a pregnancy test that same night and I noticed blood when I wiped, the test came back positive and I went to the dr the next day and I was passing the baby as they did the ultrasound.  I am glad that I didn't have the baby because my mother would have ended up raising it.
6VbNJOtfaa	Start giving her a bottle now; she won't like it.  My son would not take a bottle from me for the longest time so I had to have someone else feed him.  If you want her grandparents to be able to watch her without you there you need to start getting her used to a bottle now.  She will fuss and cry but do not let her breastfeed.  When she is truly hungry she will take the bottle.  If it is an option, I would have someone else feed her because she associates you with breastfeeding.|`|IXqCB5oqaa	There is still time.... I have been through this before, I bought a bottle that looked and felt like a breast to do the trick, you can look that up and also check out some great sites that can help you learn what will work best for you. I have listed one for you. Good Luck, I hope this works for you.|`|UCRuHz57aa	Sometimes a baby will take a bottle better if mom isn't around.  My mom breastfed all four of her babies until at least 6 months, and supplemented with formula if she was away.  She always said her babies would take a bottle, just not from her.  Try a few different bottles (she may prefer one over another), and recruit someone else your daughter knows and is comfortable with to try giving her a bottle.    You may want them to try at first at a time when she isn't really hungry, because she might get too frustrated.  She is hungry, so she wants food in a familiar way NOW!  But if you have someone try to give her something in between feedings, you may have more luck.|`|h6PMS2q2aa	Try using a bottle that is made to immitate a real nipple.  I use Dr. Browns and my daughter does fine on both my breast and the bottle.  Good luck.|`|MrKE5PAfaa	This is a tricky one. You can now get bottle tops that are so realistic to a nipple which might help. try bottle feeding her with that. you have a while yet and it will be hard. Trying having her lie in the same position you would breatfeed with the bottle. maybe its the closeness.    im really sorry but i odnt have any other suggestions    Good Luck    If all else fails, ask your mum lol, they helped you grow up after all|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I'm sure she's not hooked up to the breast 24/7. In the few hours or so between feedings you can get away for some alone time and let grandparents spend time with her. Also, you have to realize that at 5 months babies know the difference between mom and people she hasn't seen or doesn't remember, you may find it hard to leave her for a totally different reason. If you feel you really want her to be able to take a bottle, let someone else give it to her. My sister's 10 month old refused to take a bottle from mom when she was about 5 months but would accept it from dad or grandma or me. Good luck.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You still have time to get her used to the bottle. Just offer it to her when she is hungry. She will learn. Good luck.|`|9c59d30dd825704972a6d91f93b18277aa	I had this same problem with my first child, who by the way was also a female.  They can be stubborn.  I was so desperate.

You would probably want to cut back on HARDCORE running if you found out you were pregnant, but if you did it a couple of times before you knew, I highly doubt it would make a difference.  Also, when you miscarry, it wouldn't necessarily come out at the time you were having your period - it would usually come right when it actually happened.  Plus, miscarriages are usually VERY painful - way worse than a period.|`|AA11896942	No, there is no risk of miscarriage with moderate exercise.      If you're one of those super serious athletes who exercise for hours every day and have practically zero body fat, it may be difficult to conceive because your body may not have regulated cycles or ovulation.      But moderate exercise a few times a week is actually recommended, just for generally staying healthy during a pregnancy.

Primero que nada no te pongas nerviosa, digo, si ya te hiciste una prueba y no estas embarazada no tienes porque preocuparte.    Tu misma te respondiste: es un desorden hormonal por el cambio de la ingesta de anticonceptivos, pero para que estes mas segura visita a tu ginecologo.    Saludos|`|IsVRauzDaa	No tienes por que preocuparte, es normal tal vez se deba al cambio hormonal, de dejar las pastillas adems si dices que te cuidaste al tener relaciones no hay de que preocuparte, yo creo que tu retraso se debe a eso a que estas tan nerviosa y tensionada por la fechas que no dejas a tu cuerpo actue normal ,, yo te aconsejo que te relajes, no pienses en es y veras que en unos das te Baja normalmente......      si ya despus de tu fecha de regla te retrasas 10 das o mas seria conveniente hacerte un examen de sangre solo para descartar posibilidad de embarazo , que no creo , pero a mi me paso una ves estaba como tu tan nerviosa que no me Bajaba que yo misma mentalmente provocaba mas retraso me hice un examen de laboratorio y salio negativo y ese mismo da me Bajo jaja|`|hUDTIe4saa	Hola!!    Primero trankilisate, los nervios son muy malos porque te hacen que se te atrase mas.

QuOcPebmaa	Saludos  entiendo  tu  ansias de ese bebe  pues yo tambien senti lo mismo  y al  igual que  tu no puedo  tener  bebe  hasta  el  a?o  que  viene  por que bueno  tengo  un peque?o  problema con mi peso  que  antes tengo que  resolver  ademas de que estos  momentos  no estoy trabajando, tratare de decir en que forma  yo  calme un poco lo deseos  mios  y  tu veras  si  te sirve de el algo.. Lo primero que  hice  fue que me sente  solita  y hice mis  calculos  y pense si  tengo  un bebe  ahora  podre  dar le todo el tiempo que  va necesitar  esta  labor, si  tengo  un bebe  ahora  podremos  ambos  darle  lo que  esta personita merece, si  tengo un bebe sere  realmente  feliz  y lo sera mi esposo pero  mas que nada  sera  realmente  feliz mi bebe??? Bueno estas pregunta  me ayudaron a esclarecer mi pensamiento  pero sobre todo  me dieron la ayuda que necesitaba  para  pensar con la  cabeza  fria en cuanto la decision de si o no tener  un bebe en el momento y te cuento que al igual  que  tu  se un monton de informacion sobre el tema  pero sabes que hice con toda esa informacion que se sobre embarazadas y bebes pues me  vine  aqui  a yahoo  a ayudar futuras mama  que  no  tienen  mucha  informacion  y te  confiezo que me siento  super feliz  y cada dia  me siento mas  realizada y siempre me digo  el a?o que  viene sere yo quien reciba  estos consejos  de todos los colaboradores de yahoo.. Te recomiendo que  analices bien tu  vida por que un bebe  es un  Bendicion, Pero hay que estar preparados, siempre  piensa que  quieres tener el bebe pero ten en mente este  bebe no sera  bebe  por el resto de su  vida, es una persona con la  cual tu tendras que  ir evolucionando  cada  dia  de su  vida..Entonces piensa en que  lo mejor es esperar un poco mas  y combertirte en la mejor  mama que  puedas ser  hasta que llegue el momento en que debas demostrar  lo que  has aprendido..Suerte  y ya  sabes el a?o entrante primero Dios  seremos  madres ..|`|bdca19a216648f7c8299e02757b41357aa	Lo tuyo es un trastorno de ansiedad.

887473dd6877337cb899156218187fc8aa	You can my ovulation tests or you need to go to the doctor, let him know that you are ttc and then find out why your periods are soooo irregular. Good Luck!!|`|AA11896942	Have you read "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler?  I highly recommend it!  Once you learn how to chart your cycle, you can learn if you're just ovulating irregularly, or if you're not ovulating at all.  And how to use the chart in combination with Ovulation Predictor Kits from the drugstore to find out when you're most fertile.    Either way, you should see your doctor to figure out what's going on with your cycle.  You should rule out Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome or any other conditions that could make it difficult to conceive.      If there is no reason for your cycles to be irregular, but you are overweight, then I recommend losing weight.  When I lost 25 pounds, my cycles went from 60/90/100 days (they were all over the place) down to a pretty regular 29/30 days.  I did it with Weight Watchers and Curves.    Good luck!|`|e342045f73b773f00d1db2d630978b45aa	I know what you are going through so are mine.  A couple people told me to just do it every other day or two that way you will have a good chance.

f424eef3d1c7a1dbc22a6b09d89e9bafaa	If you've started what seems to be a period, then that's what it probably is. Unfortunately, having sex while your ovulating doesn't always mean that you'll get pregnant. If you've ever read all the factors that need to be just right to get pregnant, I'm always amazed that women can get pregnant at all. There is just a small window of oppurtunity of pregnancy during those few days you are ovulating.    Don't be discouraged though, just keep trying and eventually it will happen for you. It took me over a year to become pregnant with my first baby. Then, on the second try, it only took a week.    Good luck.|`|18d89d72ce28ecce9fcc9605d3d39137aa	Well just because you had sex while ovulating doesn't mean you automatically get pregnant.  It can take awhile even for healthy couples.  I would just keep trying for at least 6 months..then talk to doctor about it.|`|ab4d3b78036e646525eaab3e95491514aa	well it's only the 15th i don't think your period would be coming already uless you have irregular periods and i think it might be too soon for implantation bleeding also i just found out this morning that i'm pregnant and i ovulated from dec 29th to january 4th so i'm not to sure in this situation. i would definatly keep the doc appt. just in case and maybe the doc can tell you why you are having your period 2 times in one month within days of each other but plantation bleeding is like a brownish-red sorta gooey stuff if thats what you experienced, also never give up hope maybe you are pregnant  and good luck hun!|`|8a866ee1cc2276408f2e89f44578841faa	If the bleeding is normal than it's a period. If it's not than it could be implantation bleeding. But I think it might be too soon to tell.|`|aea695a82c7fdebee26d1e328fca8986aa	sometimes when you ovulate, you have a day or two of bleeding.  I was concerned about that too until I went to the doctor and found out it's normal.  I wouldn't worry until your doctor tells you otherwise in 2 weeks.
9eb5d8c77b6e6770fe05b9e1a93ea490aa	Perso, je suis egalement animatrice depuis 6 ans (dont la plupart de mon experience avec des enfants de 4-7 ans), et pour moi il n'y a aucun probleme a emmener des enfants de cet age en mini sejour. J'ai deja eu l'occasion de participer a des sejours (6 jours et 5 nuits) avec des enfants de 4 a 12 ans, et il n'y a pas eu de problemes, par rapport a cela (concernant la tranche d'age 4-7 ans). Evidemment, les 4 - 7 ans etaient en minorit (5 enfants en t, 10 en hiver), parce qu'il y a une certaine reticence de la part des parents a laisser partir les enfants (je me souviens que dans mon 1er sejour, 5 enfants sur 17 et le 2e pas plus d'une dizaine sur 36).     En ce qui concerne les effectifs d'animateurs, deux serait suffisants selon la legislation en vigueur (mais trois c'est mieux il vaut mieux etre prevoyant) et je suppose que de toute facon, il y aura une directrice (edit : je voulais dire une responsable), qui donc ne pourra pas etre disponible tout le temps.    Je pense que justement, ce genre de sjour peut aider a dvelopper l'autonomie du petit enfant. Par exemple, grer ses vetemements...    Je me souviens galement que lors de mon dernier sjour, le plus jeune de tous les enfants avait 4 ans et ce n'est pas lui qui a pleur le plus (en fait, meme pas du tout...)    Pour le travail des animateurs pendant le sjour t, je ne me suis pas sentie dborde du tout... par le rveil, les repas, les toilettes, le coucher. Les enfants sont capables de bien des choses... et sinon, on est la pour les aider...    Mais je pense que si tu connais les enfants, avec qui tu vas partir, que tu as deja cree une relation de confiance avec eux, le gros du boulot est deja fait...   Le plus dur est de convaincre les parents...    Parce que meme s'ils savent qu'on est joignables, qu'on leur donnent de nos nouvelles (la derniere fois, on envoyait nos nouvelles par mail), ils angoissent beaucoup par rapport a leurs enfants. Il y a aussi, le tlphone, les parents peuvent nous appeler pour se rassurer...    Edit : et comme dit Elodie, le seul risque concernant les anims est de tomber sur des guignols (dans un centre de loisirs, une anim a ete viree parce qu'elle arrivait systmatiquement en retard, qu'elle foutait rien, qu'elle a un peu m...d a la piscine => une gamine avait peur de l'eau, et elle s'inquitait plus pour l'etat de ses mains,  et qu'elle avait un gros probleme sur les origines des enfants : "Est ce que c'etait  bien en Irak ?", et elle recherchait dans les dossiers quelles etaient les origines des enfants qui frequentaient le centre)    On sait gerer aussi toutes les peurs des enfants, et on est la pour les rassurer, leur raconter une histoire, leur faire un calin. Et ils emmenent aussi leur doudou de chez eux...  On aurait du avoir un enfant qui faisait encore pipi au lit, et dont le pere tenait absolument a accompagner et qu'il voulait une chambre a part, mais finalement cela ne s'est pas fait... Mais on sait egalement grer cela...      Perso, je serais parent, je ne sais pas si je laisserais ma fille (oups, un lapsus rvlateur) partir en sejour... J'aurais peut etre des reticences par rapport a la separation... meme si je sais que le sejour peut l'aider a favoriser son autonomie.

Il y a une rglementation trs stricte (1 adulte pour 4 pour les enfants de 4 ans, 1 pour 6 pour les 6 ans etc...) pareil pour la nourriture c'est hyper control et pareil pour ce qui est des lieux d'accueil...      Alors  moins de tomber sur une quipe de branquignoles qui ne sont bons  rien... (et je sais de quoi je parle parce que j'ai d? virer un aniamteur au cours d'un de mes sjours car il s'est avr qu'il fumait des ptards pendant le camp) il n'y a que trs peu de risques...      3 jours c'est rien... Bien s?r si votre enfant part  l'cole en pleurant c'est la peine  si votre enfant est un petit tre assez indpendant, alors ?a sera vraiment super pour lui.. Maintenant s'il a besoin de beaucoup de calins et qu'on le rassure tous les jours.. s'il a des rituels trs prenants c'est pas la peine non plus...

(Wow, que rico! con todo respeto) Entonces nada mas depende de que tan estimulada este.  3.- Lo mas probable es que sea porque por tanto "aguantar" termina por perder la estimulacion, lo que pueden hacer es volver a estimularse mutuamente para que pueda tener un final feliz...!    Espero te haya ayudado aunque sea un poquito.    Saldudos...!!!|`|dAMr5BZMaa	Hola mira que yo sepa 100% una mujer no puede qeudar embarazada, si esta reglando.    y si una mujer puede tener asta 3 orgasmos en el acto,    y la ultima no se como explicarte asi que te la debo ok???    suerte espero que te sirba de algo  besitos!!!|`|AvLf78y5aa	se  supone  que  no   cuando  estas  es  tus  dias  es  cusndo  el  ovulo  no  fue  fecundado  por  eso  tines  el  periodo.    yo  digo  que  si  se  peden  tener  mas  de  uno.      que  se le  fueron  las  ganas.
1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Hola Ivi.      Pues creo que ya te han respondido muchas cosas ciertas, como bien dicen, si estas ovulando no importa si es la primera, segunda, vigecimaquinta o ltima vez que lo haces, tienes posibilidades de quedar embarazada, asi es la naturaleza. Tu puedes determinar si estabas o no ovulando: si tu ciclo es regular, (cada 28 das te llega tu periodo), cuenta 14 das a partir de tu primer da de regla para determinar tu da ms fertil, por ejemplo, si comenzaste a reglar el 1 del mes el da 14 es el da ms fertil; a partir de ese da catorce cuenta 4 das antes y cuatro das despues; este periodo de 9  10 das es el ms fertil de tu periodo, por lo tanto corres el riesgo de quedar embarazada. En este periodo debes de extremar precauciones para evitar un embarazo, (si es que no lo quieres), el resto de los das de tu periodo no tienes tanto riesgo, pero no te confies, cuidate de cualquier forma.  Como bien te dijo alguien: si tienes dudas ve a la farmacia, compra una prueba de embarazo y utilizala, para que tenga ms efectividad te recomiendo que la utilices al siguiente da en que se supone debes de esperar tu primer da de regla, (claro, si es que eres regualr y no te ha llegado por supuesto, de lo contrario ya ni la utilices).    Lo que realmente espero es que esa primera vez alla sido tan maravillosa como tu lo habias deseado y si no fue as no te preocupes, ya tendras ms oportunidades de disfrutar las maravillas del sexo.    Te recomiendo que, para que ya no estes con estas preocupaciones, (que son ATERRADORAS!) consultes a un ginecologo para que te recomiende un metodo anticonceptivo apropiado para ti. No lo dejes a la suerte, ni a las recomendaciones de los dems, muchos menos a "remedios caseros" para evitar embarazos o "para provocar que te llegue la regla"; si llegas a quedar embarazada no hay nada que lo impida, interrumpa o detenga, a menos que sea un aborto o un legrado.    Espero te haya ayudado en algo y en verdad te reitero: pide ayuda profesional para que disfrutes al maximo tu sexualidad.    Bienvenida al maravilloso mundo del sexo activo...! (pero con responsabilidad)    Bueno... eso digo yo...!    Saludos...!|`|UiukNWuraa	Si aunque sea la 1era vez si hay riesgos d quedar embarazada si dices q te cuidaste entonces quitate ese mal presentimiento porque si sigues asi d estresada tu periodo se puede retrasar asi q mejor calmate.|`|uc7xyl17aa	aham!!! hay una chika en mi colegio k le dicen ivi aham!! no creo k seas tu pero bueno k mas da lo k creo es k si es la primera vez uno siempr cree en algo malo...|`|Qy1uNnBVaa	Mira no ase muxo tube mi primera ves y pense qe era la unica qe le ocurria eso mil dudas entraron en mi mente...pero luego pasa toma las precauciones y nunk nunk jamas lo agas sin proteccion!!! dimelo a mi qe tengo unos meses de embarazo y qede embarazada poco depues de tener mi primera relacion    bueno un beso adios|`|XvssbxRQaa	si si puedes quedar embarazada|`|fb3f8ad2c06962a2af08356d027398b7aa	Siempre hay riesgo de embarazo , pero si tomaste todas las precauciones no dbes temer... y no te preocupes es normal tener dudas   =)|`|LlkZyOq0aa	mira q bueno q t hayas cuidado felicidades por eso, si tomaste las debidas precauciones, no te preocupes lo mas probable es q no estes embarazada, si es normal q pienses tanto en eso, y la verdad es q generalmente las "primeras veces" no son tan buenas como uno quisiera, con el tiempo van siendo mejor, pero tu tranquila sigue cuidandote y te mando saludos, hasta luego!!!|`|7c2bd65a70170a185717e7bdc4553ee0aa	Quitate de dudas, ve a la farmacia y compra una prueba de embarazo, es sencilla de utilizar.

Pasadas dos semanas y media despus de que tuviste relaciones puedes hacerte una prueba de embarazo y si resulta que no ests, pues para la prxima toma todas las precauciones del caso, OJO: no slo para no embarazarte, sino para proteger tu salud. Ya s que vas a decir --como todas-- que no tienes relaciones con cualquiera y que te fijas muy bien en eso, pero a las enfermedades de transmisin sexual eso les importa un comino. Lo mejor de lo mejor es cuidarse siempre porque eso NUNCA EST DE MS.

bcbd5d9853a58cc1bf116283fc01f793aa	First and foremost I would make sure you tell him no matter what his choice is ...... he should NEVER feel guilty.  Trying to make a 10 yr old feel guilty because he's not there is ridiculous and cruel.  If she continues doing this, I would tell her she's allowed to talk to him, but the second she starts crying to him wanting to live with her, I would end the conversation.  It's not fair for your 10 yr old to have to feel that way.    If he's having a horrible time, I would suggest going for split custody.  He's old enough to where he won't be confused.  Plus he'll be able to see that even though his parents don't get along anymore, they are at least able to come to an agreement.    Good luck to you and your son!|`|78d46de82dc8976af0d65d2e281b1206aa	just get 50/50 custody you get weeks or your wife get weeks and you get weekends and your wife gets a full week with your son so that way he get his education and on the weekend he can stay with you.|`|AA11096471	mom sounds like she's truely heartbroken, but is being a bit minipulating...moms can do that you know.   well, since your son is old enough to decide for himself which parent he wants to live with, what he says pretty much goes. but if mom is going to put up a fight, then maybe it's best to go to family court. that way someone outside of the family circle can decide what's best for the boy.   good luck.|`|32d480916cc4b91b7d982ba35e734fe7aa	You want to do what is best for your son.  He is 10 years old, a child, and although he has an opinion, he does not know what is best for him.  Obviously his mother sounds like she is a bit dramatic and manipulating.  It is unfair for her to try to manipulate her own son and not think of what is best for him.  At this age, I would say it is very important for your ten year old son to start learning to be a man and to be with his dad.  You don't want your son growing up to be a drama queen like his mama!|`|674c6c802dbcd154a60bfef1dba0d8abaa	Well, you need to have a conference date with your son's mom over dinner in a public place, you two need to work this out and realize that you both made the decision to allow him to pick who he wants to live with.  Then both of you need to sit him down and let him know that no matter who he chooses, you both will still love him very much.  Then make him choose right then and there.  You also need to set up some kind of schedule at the best interest of your son to see the other parent.  believe it or not, the one that is hurting the most out of your separation is your son.  Also, please do not use your kid to get back at your ex.  You two decided to bring him into this world, it is not his fault things didn't work out.  So do what's best for him, not yourselves.  Good luck.|`|5cd24b64757b60422674beaef7e91e06aa	Just support his decision and if he chooses you don't gloat to your wife, that could make problems.

525388dfda86d1c67fba0771534e915eaa	Don't give up hope yet, because right before I missed my period and found out I was pregnant, I was totally convinced that I wasn't pregnant and was about to start my period, because the symptoms were exactly the same...same amount of breast tenderness, even cramps, etc.   Have you talked to your doctor about trying to conceive yet? They might be able to help you with the signs and coming in for an  test if you don't want to agonize waiting to see if you get your period next month.|`|AA11226053	Honestly, the only way to know is to go & buy a home pregnancy test.|`|fe9bfac95a39fb6b89396c021bb9fc7eaa	Could be, take a test or go to the Dr.|`|1443ac90b31a81ae579f11d475c71b7caa	I had implantion bleeding with my  twin girls, I put a pad on and it was the only one I had to use. It sounds like you possibly just had a lighter period but take a test to find out for sure. Did your period come on time or earlier. I had my implantion bleeding 7 days after I got pregnant, so about a week early. I had my bleeding late because my twin implanted very late, and were mono-mono twins, one day later and they would been conjoined. YOu should have implantion bleeding about 5 days after you become pregnant.
4a6b7a9cf1ebeaa5209c775f25272cbdaa	I believe that it would be alright to have a second baby shower.   Since people were aware of the situation with your first child, I think they would be understanding and want to celebrate with you as you welcome a new life into the world.  And I found an etiquette article which says that all babies should be celebrated.   I think that since your situation with your first child was special, other people would want the chance to celebrate your new pregnancy with you.      I hope for health and happiness for you and your new baby.|`|ea3058b837aea3705f38fc2f85b54ea0aa	to me, it really depends on how long it has been since you were last pregnant.  if it has been over 5 years, i say ok to a 2nd shower.  otherwise friends & family might have hard feeling about you giving their first gifts away.|`|c3b80f9e11bc0d155964af7ea8131ea8aa	First, sorry to hear of your loss.  I know that is hard.    Second, OF COURSE you can have another shower!! Why on earth not???? If someone you invited has an issue, tell them they won't be missed!! You should celebrate your new baby, and i am sure your friends and family feel the same.  If they don't want to "buy" you things, then maybe they could make you something personal and meaning ful (scrap book, letter to the baby, quilt, etc) I am sure you would appreciate it just as much!! And given that you no longer have those items, why would anyone object??  So poo on them if they think it is wrong, shame on them too!!  So, have your shower and have fun!!!   Congrats on your baby!!|`|523cdb440c9c6d48365f2615db87eed8aa	It would have been way to hard to save the things.  My friend gave everything away from her first with ended the same way.  I don't think there is anything wrong with having another baby shower!  You will need things all over again, plus shower's are more than parties to get presents....I think they kind of celebrate the baby.  Go for it!|`|443b16aad0d8f9073ae58465b8d6807caa	I think that it would be perfectly normal and fine to have another baby shower for your new little blessing.I am sorry for the loss of your daughter-I too am pregnant and cannot imagine losing my baby.I say have one to celebrate this new little life!|`|c1dc357ad86f726b2bf4ec73db983665aa	I think so. This is a new baby and new chance for life. I hope and pray the best for you and your baby. Good luck with everything.|`|1443ac90b31a81ae579f11d475c71b7caa	You can have another, even without your circumstances from your first baby it would be ok. Lots of people have 2 or 3 or even more baby showers. I had one with my son and a small when when I had my twins, mainly because I was having girls AND twins and needed all thet stuff I could get.     I have friends who have had more than 1 baby shower, I dont see anything wrong with it|`|AA10530337	I don't see why not. I had 2 showers. I am sure your family and friends would throw you a shower anyway.
f5027b4ac5c5df2e52f7693a60399c23aa	girl if your kids are bad they need to be spanked as long as your not beating them there is a diff. but swat on the butt wont hurt them. if you dont let them know who is in charge they will run all over you and you will regret it. I would not interfere either unless your child is in danger and i drought that is the case. if i were you i would sit down with your husband and discuss this because if you dont it can cause a problem between you too and cause you to separate i have seen it and its not a good thing to do fighting over children it should be a teamwork effort on everything. and for your 9 year old hitting that is wrong just rem the older he gets the stronger and you dont want him to take charge of you and think he is the boss your husband had the right intentions. my son hit me one day my husband turned around and spanked him he has never touched me again . children are suppose to respect their elders no matter what I am 22 and i know that.   i wish you the best of luck.|`|8a406de12bcb3f873a4a578fdb7e86b5aa	Yes because if he is hitting you then he needs to be shown respect. I know that bothers you...but you can not stop him from going to jail when he beats a woman up later on in life...and tell the judge hey lets not do the prison lets just take his car away. I am not being mean I promise just giving a different perspective. I do not believe in spankings all the time either...but he should feel it when he goes after you! Good Luck and I meant this to be sincere and not disrespect you in anyway. Let your husband handle this one!|`|AA11657209	I  think spanking is ok only if the child has done something serious , and I think hitting you is serious. Especially since he is 9. That is too old to start picking up that kind of behavior and needs to be stopped now. I was spanked when I was a child and so was my brother, and its the way I learned and I am definiltey in no way a violent person, or anything. But Grounding did nothing for me, neither did taking priviledges away. But when I got spanked, I never did it again. I rarley did get spanked though because I just knew better. It didnt teach me to hit either.. I think Spanking should be used for cases such as that.|`|151d236db0cc9d95a4319f0fb2ec0469aa	I think spankings are very affective. The children I know who aren't spanked are actually horribly behaved. I was spanked, my parents were spanked, my grandparents were spanked and we all turned out wonderful--at least in my opinion :-)    Anyway, I'd say go for it. Not for every little thing, but when he does something seriously bad I think a spanking is appropriate.|`|b5330195459303a0d71d33b34173ce51aa	Spanking a 9 year old is not good. The child is old enough to understand non-physical punishment. I think you were right in stopping him. Try and find a book that is not again spankings that you and your husband can read together. That way he won't feel like you're telling him what he can't do with his children, but he will learn more effective ways of dealing with them.|`|9b3a152b62305ef2b7fbe242d4333a48aa	Tough situation because biologically they are not yours.  But having legally adopted you should have equal parenting rights.    Personally I think there is nothing wrong with spankings.  I was spanked as a child.      Yesterday we did a shopping day with my sister in law and nephew and niece, I played with my nephew the most (he's 2) he is also very strong willed.  Her and my brother give him "Talks" when he's being bad.  After we left them yesterday I asked my mom, "Were we ever as bad in public as Drew is?"  "Never, I can never remember you guys being like that."  And we think perhaps it's because the dicipline isn't the same.  How scary is a "Talk" to a child, not as scary as being hurt or getting in REAL trouble.  A talk is only more so annoying to a child than anything really...|`|ecbb8885dceda8d096f5e8eb4efe2af4aa	If you are both raising these children and not in sync with the rules, you are doing more harm than good. I do not believe in spanking so I am with you on that. You should have as much right to say what you want to . Remember that one day they might tell you "Your not my mother and I don't have to listen to you" Don't let that bother you. Right now you both are giving the kids the right to play one against the other. Sit down with your husband and voice your opinion.Hitting them will only make them more angry and then something else will happen.If is OK for my Dad to hit, then its OK for me to hit.|`|5327cad2872e4cdd4e0e4b339d825a0aaa	i think spanking is ok in some cases, just a light spanking though, enough to get the kid to know hes in trouble but nothing serious. Although, i dont think you should spank a kid for hitting someone. Your hitting him for hitting, it doesnt make sense.|`|43e61ba54eb8879192d88edbc1b4b8f9aa	According to bible proverbs 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. so talk to the child teach them in a nice way. but there is nothing wrong in hitting according to bible  Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. If we hit a child that is one way to teach him the right thing.|`|27686a1ae727efafee4310d61c1eab28aa	I personally thik that spankings will work better, when I was little all I got was stuff taken away, and it proved they wouldn't do anything bad if I did.|`|6cc20c52cc4407e799b89962d5e63437aa	Spanking should always be a last resort. Its been proven that kids that are spanked regularly are more aggressive when they get older......thats not to say that a good *** whoopin isn't needed from time to time.|`|baa8470a779ef773f54974026721e16aaa	Spankings are not effective for a nine year old and will most likely make them (like someone else said) more aggressive.   I do agree that since you are not considered a step parent you should have a say in their discipline. I tis great that your husband wants the boys to respect you, but hitting him isn't going to show respect. You need to show him respect by speaking to him not giving corporal punishment. He can definately understand why it is wrong to hit (him hitting you and you hitting him).  My SIL bites her children if they bite, and I don't agree.  This shows that since I am bigger and stronger than you, only I am allowed to hit or show aggression. This hurts feelings and makes the children scared not obedient.  Children do need consequences, but respectful ones.|`|c49859e845cbf22e433a691aab8e634eaa	what i think u should do is discuss whats happen and give him ideas on how to treat this matter rather then letting him be the person to be the controller in the situation ,i understand u are there step mother but i think u have a say in this also cause they are in your life also .but if that doesn't work then try and siting the kids on the chair or sit in the corner ,or wait until they are calm down and then talk to then about what had happen or  until they are ready to talk about it.or have family meeting s on the situations and discuss it with the kids on what there punishment shoul dbe on there behavior!|`|4c64f92728a25cb7f2aaa5a56ffb2c76aa	I'm one of these women that beleive if you get your bluff in early in the game, you can save your kids alot of heartache.  I taught mine that if you hit, you just may get hit back, and most likely will.  Time out and taking away things can work for some situations, but not for all.  Sometimes they have to see what it's like to be hit and that's it's not a good feeling, same goes for biting, kicking, etc.  A good spanking, not a beating can be very beneficial.  Being strong willed is not neccessarely a bad thing, but they have to learn they can't go around hitting people, cause at some point they'll meet up on somebody that'll hit back.    Good luck|`|e1f5f5ed8001d333017adac4edabec70aa	i dont think that its wrong to spank your kid. but there is also a limit. Spankink him for hitting you or something that is worth giving him a spank is okay but just spanking him for little things....no. Use your method(groundation ect) when he does little things but let your husband spank him when he does something big like hitting you.

I haven't left him for a week but I am breast feeding so that would just be too much of a hassle right now and not very fair to him. I think it would not only be good for him but for you too. I know when I get my boys back after 1 night I am so excited to see them it makes me a better parent!|`|3fb16c5a7241a29114b64e4eec57bc3caa	I have and he was exactly 9 months.  We went to british columbia for 3 days, ended up stying a full week...didnt want to come home...except for the kid of course.  So yeah, I did.|`|3d72111551fcefd2bbeeb409e8cb996baa	I went to London when my son was 2,  he stayed with his "grandparent type" babysitters.  I was miserable the whole time.  I cried every night I was there.  I wouldn't do it unless YOU can handle it.  The child won't remember,  and as long as he/she is staying with really great people don't worry about it.  "if" you can deal.  I couldn't and regretted it.|`|AA11069612	Sure you are going to miss him/her, but every parent deserves "me" time.  Just call and check in daily or couple time daily and talk to him/her.  That is what I did.  I felt guilty, but I knew I needed a mental break.|`|AA12240002	I say do what you feel comfortable to you, but i would NEVER leave m 9 month old for a week to me that's too long at that age they need and want their mommy.|`|AA10733703	Home alone?|`|AA11212357	I think you should feel guilty...its also illegal|`|1782f91fb9357a80426da60ea8eeed83aa	Nah, the kid'll be fine, just leave alot of food and water in the crib and line it with newspapers... should be fine.|`|AA10047634	Depends. If you left him unattended, that's criminal. But I assume you left him with grandma. That's just fine. A 9 month old would not know or care about such a trip, and would probably feel unsettled anyway. A little time with Grandma is good for him AND for you. Enjoy the time off. You're not going to get a lot of it over the next few years.|`|AA10943329	If you are not feeling guilt then don't worry. You are obviously happy where you are leaving him. Enjoy your holiday. I haven't gone for a week, the longest I have left them was for a girls weekend. Did I feel guilt NOPE! They were with the grandparents and it was my first girls weekend. I had a ball. I don't get away ever by myself so I refuse to feel guilty over it.
AA11283931	You can still have a period the first month it may be lighter then normal.. but you can still have one....|`|AA11657209	That is right.

SOME WOMEN DO HAVE WHAT SEEMS TO BE A PERIOD AT SOME TIME DURING THEIR PREGNANCY, ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING STAGE.  SOME SPOT MOST OF THE TIME ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PREGNANCY.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO A BIT OF READING ON THE SUBJECT IF YOU ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE.  IT ALSO SEEMS YOU MAY HAVE HAD UNPROTECTED SEX.  THIS IS VERY UNWISE IN THESE DAYS.  PLEASE PROTECT YOU AND YOUR PARTNER WITH A CONDOM.|`|0b89037a2d8b8f0e2ae7b05a6049d035aa	yes it means your not u can never have a period and be pregnant but u can have vaginal bleeding
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	from what it sounds like it could be 50/50 cause yeah sperm can be going in, but the spermicide on the condom could be killing the sperm, but yeah 50/50 especially because condoms are only effective if used properly.|`|AA10925312	The chances are pretty good since it takes only one swimmer to penetrate your egg.  So, it's time you plan a marriage if you are not married already.  If you are married, congratulations to you and your husband.  The baby thanks you and so will the adult!|`|dab5007fd05df1ab6c33eff6d5b469e5aa	Many condoms also include a spermicide, which will kill the sperm.  Use a lubricant, such as K-Y without any condom, and you will increase the likelyhood of success.|`|m9wx9rQIaa	Well use the lube that dont have any affect to you and to the sperm.. i bet you it wil be a success!     congrats|`|d4bb34926cc5285d4324f5fb33dd393daa	not good, not becaues of the condom but because of the vaginal dryness. Your dryness is bad for the spermies. Get a good lube.
05Ej0DGtaa	when you feel stressed, close your eyes for 2 minutes, tilt your head back and take deep breaths. inhale slowly through your nose and release slowly through your mouth. do this for 2 mins and you`ll feel better.|`|c3dcff4a3f7cc2934c0ee92bae3fa5eeaa	Why are you crying?    If this behavior has been around for more than a few weeks, you should talk to your doctor.  You may have depression.  You can get treatment in the forms of anti-depressants, counseling, and/or lifestyle changes.    Other than that, try to make sure you're getting enough rest.  Try to find some time to yourself.  You may want to look into a mothers-day-out program, or joining a MOPS group (moms of preschoolers).  What's great about those options is that you can have some time to yourself and know your kids are well taken care of.    Try to remember, you are definately not the first mom to go through this.  It could be that you're expecting too much of yourself, so the more upset you get, the more guilty you feel about it, which causes you to be more upset.    Anyway, good luck!|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Crying in front of your kids is not wrong. It shows you have feelings too! However you dont want them to be the ones to comfort you when there is trouble....you need "your own time" to relax....it could be when you take a bath before going to bed...without the kids.  You will know in your mind that you have some time everyday for yourself to let go and not stress out in front of your kids..|`|FocA20RQaa	Stress is how you perceive it to be. Times will get hard. Rather than feeling like there is nothing can be done, use a mean to vent your frustration. Try exercising, playing with your kids and exploring a new activity. Meditating is really cool.|`|qGQpkegoaa	Hug him in, pat his back and told him 'It's ok, Mum's gona be ok.' I think one year old will understand a little.  But in my opion, I don't think it's good to hold all stress in front of the kids. Kids need to know sometimes life's not easy and Mum's doing hard for the family.

Peu avant de le faire (et c'est l'une des raisons qui m'a pousse  le faire) je suis alle voir mon mdecin, celui ci me demande si je prends la pilule, quand je lui ai dit que non, il m'a d'abord disput en me disant qu'il fallait se protger, j'ai donc d? lui expliquer que je n'avais pas encore de rapport. Il m'a demand ce qu'y n'allait pas, si j'tais complexe, si j'tais clibataire. Je lui ai dit simplement que je n'tais pas s?r d'aimer assez l'homme avec qui j'tais, je ne me sentais pas en confiance. Il m'a rpondu " mais enfin, vous vous rendez compte que la moyenne chez une fille c'est 15 ans...il doit vous aimez cet homme pour attendre pendant 3 ans..."Bref la plus grosse honte de ma vie. Je pense qu'il n'y a pas d'age pour le faire, le tout c'est de se sentir en confiance, d'aimer l'autre et de penser que c'est rciproque....

Esta hormona aumenta rpidamente durante el primer trimestre, aunque durante el resto del embarazo disminuye bruscamente. Esto es debido a que durante el primer trimestre la hormona es necesaria para mantener la produccin de progesterona por el cuerpo lteo, mientras que al principio del segundo trimestre la placenta ya produce toda la progesterona necesaria para mantener el endometrio La hGC tambin estimula el desarrollo de las gnadas fetales.      Si por motivos mdicos ( o porque ya no aguantas ms la incertidumbre), quieres saber si ests embarazada antes de tener un retraso, puedes hacerte una "beta" a los dez das de la fecha en la quen calcules que has ovulado y obtendrs un resultado fiable.

nS5hPqoTaa	Si se usan dos nombres, lo que ya no se usan son los nombres compuestos. Es diferente tener dos nombres a tener nombres compuestos...Los compuestos son aquellos que no se separan; siempre se llaman por los dos nombres: Jose Luis, Juan Jose, Juan Manuel, Juan Cruz, Jose Ariel. Esos siempre los llamas asi, nunca vas a llamar Jose o Luis...Los compuestos de mujer son todos aquellos que llevan Maria; Maria Cristina, Maria Fernanda, Maria Belen, Ana Maria, etc.   Es bueno que tu hijo tenga un segundo nombre por varios motivos.  1. Si el primer nombre no le gusta, puede usar el segundo  2. Si en la escuela, trabajo o cualquier tipo de institucion que valla hay varias personas con el mismo nombre, es bueno que tenga un segundo nombre para poder identificarlo  3. Muchas veces hay nombres y apellidos muy comunes como Adrian Garcia, Adrian Gonzalez, Maria Lopez. Imaginate, si estas personas no tienen segundos nombres, es sumamente dificil de identificarlas. Causa confusion en cualquier identidad que asistan.   Te recomiendo que uses un solo nombre si el apellido que tendra el bebe es unico y exlusivo o poco comun y si el nombre tiene fuerza, personalidad y no es muy comun. Es muy probable que halla otro Juan Perez....|`|GMNVkIcDaa	Estoy de acuerdo con BB, aunque no lo uses lo tienes  y puede evitar muchas confusiones en especial en la esuela  un examen de Juan Garca  puede confundirse con otro de igual nombre, pero si dices Juan Manuel, o Juan Ignacio es ms identificable.

wz3XC05Uaa	stop the sweets,its the only way, he will eat when he realises he's not getting sweets.if he's hungry eventually he will, ihad it with my son you have to be cruel to be kind sometimes.good luck.|`|3meIiIsmaa	All children go through "phases" - and even picky eaters won't allow themselves to starve (unless there is underlying illness). The first thing you need to do is cut out all sweets -unless it is fruit -including sweetened drinks, unless they are 100% fruit juice.  1- give him a gummy vitamin everyday -that way you know he is getting essential nutrition.  2-A "plate-full" of food is intimidating to a toddler. Only give him a few pieces of "finger food" at a time. (usually on the tray is fine-as 1 yr. olds haven't mastered the "don't throw it in the floor" reasoning) A few green beans, a couple of bites of chicken or a turkey frank, a cube or two of cheese.  3 - "deconstruct" food for him -most toddlers don't like saucy, slimy, or spicy food. For instance-If you're fixing a chicken casserole-leave some boiled chicken, plain noodles, plain veggies, etc. out of the sauce - for toddler.  4- "dinner time" is always in the high chair, with the family, at the table.  "snack time" can be at your discretion. If he is allowed to walk around and eat - then leave his sippy cup of milk (another good nutrition) and fruit, dry cereal,or cheese, etc -in a convenient spot-that he can go back to for his snack. (like a low table or shelf), but don't over-do the snacks - he needs to be hungry at the next meal - so he will learn to eat at the appropriate time and place.  Remember that his tummy is still small and digests more quickly than an adult's - he needs smaller meals, more often.  Plan on 5-6 small meals per day -the three larger ones that we eat - and 2-3 "snack meals" in between.    Studies show that if given proper choices over a period of a week's time - a toddler will almost always end up balancing his diet- not to say that one day may be all meat and the next only fruit - The key here is that ALL the choices you provide for him must be nutitional - regardless of what he chooses, it is a good nutitional item.  You have the control over what is provided for him - you can give him a cookie-but make sure it is sweetened with fruit or corn syrup, and contains nutritional value, not loads of sugar and empty calories.   And he'll outgrow this- and you'll have another challenge on your hands --  Enjoy him , they grow up toooo quickly.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	you can try less bottles, NO SWEETS. keep at it, try different veggies but for the first bit don't give him anything too tasty like fruits. try bland tasting foods at first, like mashed potatoes. He will be getting less fluids and sugars at first and it is a natural instinct to eat if you have not taken in enough fluids. try it for two days (he will be fine even if he doesn't eat it all) but for the most part he will eventually eat. (i think you have a boy who will grow up with a sweet tooth, lol)      -keep trying i know its frustrating, you really will miss it when he's 10 and talking back...|`|EYSl68csaa	My daughter has these times like yesterday where she will barely eat anything at all (she is a sweet eater to but not allowed without eating actual food) so I just leave her some all day munch ables grapes and cheese and stuff that keeps in open air and when she decides she is hungry she starts snacking, she also carries a plastic baggy of snacks around with her sometimes cereal sometimes chips or fruit, I think she just gets "to busy" to sit down and eat.    Some days she eats like a horse and you can not keep her fed.    So far this is working for me, she does always have a sippy or big girl cup of juice or milk etc, lots of nutrients in milk if you can at least get him to drink something.|`|ycdkngxlaa	Basically give him foods which he will eat and plenty of fluids. I would try getting him on some kids vitamins and minerals too, so he is getting all he needs to build up his body. Just slowly introduce other things into his diet. I would still take him back to the doctors though and see if they can help with anything.|`|iZ4JugiAaa	Stop giving him sweets.  If he whines until you give him sweets, ignore the whining.  It's your job to train HIM, but it sounds as though he's training YOU.  When he gets hungry enough, he'll eat nutritious food.  He won't die of starvation if he misses a few meals.  It's more important to get good, nutritious food into him than just to get him to eat something, anything, three times a day.  |`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	There was an episode of The Doctors they addressed this issue.  The doctor sat down for a meal with the family to show how to solve.    I can't remember all details but the jist of it:  They placed the food on the table.  Gave everyone a plate of food except the child.  Left the childs plate empty.  Begun eating.  When the child saw everyone had food and was eating and they had none on their plate...  The child looked at the food and request it and ate it.

My doctor has advised so long as he is drinking plenty he will be fine.

Its very frustrating preparing meal after meal to have him turn it down so what we do is get him to help prepare easy snacks and have him taste and try things just so we know something is going in. fruits are popular, we cut them up to make faces and play a game of eating the eyes, nose, mouth and hair...  be patient and stop worrying, they sense it!|`|d77fe6d1064cc9b23e59133e7c6ae46daa	Dont worry as a lot of kids go through this, just a word of advice though, cut the sweets out, our son is 22 months old and hasnt had a sweet in his mouth yet but eats like a horse.Try some weetabix for breakfast with some oats mixed in, you can add some multi vitamins to this, and remember  he will eat when he is hungry, try not to get too stressed
c55O7jqXaa	This was clearly a misunderstanding and you would think the Principal would have brought them all in and got the stories from everyone and also allowed you time to talk. Now I do understand their pont of view on it too and the rules at school. They have to follow the rules no matter what. Some rules cannot be broken when it comes to things such a knives even if it wasn't his fault. I am sorry this happened, but now he knows and you know to check his bag before sending him off and let him know in no uncertain terms about what he can have in his bag and what he can't.     I would write a nice letter to the Principal apologizing and explaining the situation assuring this will never happen again. I will also keep a copy and send one to the Superintendent asking if you son can do anything to get this removed from his record.     Mistakes happen. Now you know and this won't happen again. Just do the suspension and go back to school. If you don't agree with other things they are doing in the school then consider homeschooling him, but don't let fear be the reason for homeschooling. He will need to face these people again and kids.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	In the heightened state of violence in which our nation is in, children as young as your son making plans to murder their own teacher for example, it is an acceptable punishment to be suspended, even expelled. Parents (myself included) need to really learn to take the time to listen to our children for one day, just as you have now experienced, they may truly need our help. I am certain you can appeal the decision for either actions but in truth, you may just want to look into private school or home-school (or even cyber-school, we go through Agora for this) him for a bit and attempt to send him back at a later time.    The boys who violated your son's privacy by looking through his backpack should also be reprimanded.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	It was an honest mistake. I think the school overreacted. I don't see that as a big threat at all.    Best Answer - You are so right on the Cartoon Network thing!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	All you need to worry about now is making sure your son understand not to touch any knifes or other weapons he finds laying around (which he should know at eight years old). If he finds something he needs to let an adult know. Make sure he knows from now on to never take a weapon to school. You need to contact the principal about your son's future at the school and explain the situation, tell her/him that you've spoken with your son and he honestly didn't realize he shouldn't have weapons at school but now does and see what you and your son need to do to get him back in school. Kids make mistakes and they have to learn from them, but this situation can get resolved.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	You should have listened to him. Those boys should have gotten into trouble as well.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	missy you are a goober|`|5D0KuT74aa	why did he take the knife in the first place  you're very lucky he wasn't expelled, bringing a knife to school is very serious|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Yes, he should be suspended.   By the way, I think 10 days is a little long.  Check to see if that is the schools standard policy for that age group.  Everyone knows the rules about knives, guns, etc. in school.  But, he shouldn't be expelled.      And yes, there are a lot of people to add blame to.  But bottom line, he shouldn't have picked up the knife to start with.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	Yeah the boys shouldnt have been looking in his bookbag but other people are at fault too.  Parents- For leaving a knife visibly out for an 8 year old to see.  8 year old- who knows not to bring a knife to school.  Cartoon Network- For showing knives as being cool to play with and fight with|`|4el3goYMaa	I do not feel that he should be expelled. He is only 8 years old and it was a mistake. I think that 10 days suspension is enough! THe most important thing is to talk to and comfort your son. Good Luck.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Well there are a lot of people to blame in this.    1) Whoever left the knife where an 8 year old could find it.  2) You son - both for picking it up in the first place, and then not telling an adult he has it (whether it was the bus driver or a teacher)  3) The boys who went into his bookbag    The teachers can't be everywhere at once, and therefore cannot be keeping an eye on each child, every minute of the school day - so there isn't any blame there.     As for punishment - I think he's been punished enough by being suspended for the offense, and with the possible threat of being expelled.|`|6kgS5eN9aa	Dang Rules Anyway.....in the good ol' days, every kid had knives in school.....no one ever got hurt, no one complained, most kids needed knives to cut ropes, baling hay, make forts, etc.    Dang Rules ......Dang, Dang, Dang    It makes me sad to think a few rotten eggs have spoiled it for al of us.  I say, BRING KNIVES BACK TO SCHOOLS, then of course now we have an abundance of ATTORNEYS to sue us.....maybe.....oh, I better not say that!!!  Never mind., lol,lol    I am so sorry for your situation.....If I come up with something I will write back soon.

I did and I had to wear panty liners which those helped a lot. Hope this helps
iv0aR3DRaa	This is a very common feeling, It is usually associated with pressure on your cervix, and that can feel like someone pressing a nerve.  For the most part, this is nothing to be concerned about.  The best thing you can do is try to get the baby to give your cervix a rest.  The best way to do this is by getting down on all fours.  Gravity works, even for babies in utero!  When you get down on all fours, the baby should drop to the front of your belly , and you should get some relief!  You can also safely used Tylenol for pain in pregnancy.  Another great way to lift baby off of your cervix and joints is by getting in a pool, if you have that luxury.  Simply walking back and forth in a pool is great for you and for baby.  The resistence of the water on your body makes this a very effective exercise, but be sure to keep it to only half and hour.  It is very easy to do too much when you are in the water, and you won't feel the error of your ways until you are out, and then it is too late.    All of this is said with one caveat; while what you are decribing is considered very normal, cervical pain should always be taken seriously, especially if accompanied by increased or bloody discharge, back pain, loose stools or regular and intense contractions.  In the presence of any of these symptoms, an immediate call to your OB is necessary.  In the absence of these, at the very least describe your paon to your OB at your next visit.  And lastly, always remember that no one knows your body better than you.  If you feel something is wrong, do not hesistate to call your OB.    Good luck with your pregnancy!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	sorry dear, its normal and you cant really stop it. its just pressure from the baby...its pelvic pressure.  im 32 weeks with twins and it hurts so bad i can't move.  make sure to tell your doctor about this because they may want to talk to you about bedrest.|`|LrHPqW0aaa	I am 32 weeks too and feel the exact same things as you do, it's normal the baby is getting ready for birth. Not much you can do about it.|`|nvsVXlBlaa	i had two kids 14 months apart. pains are normal|`|bLluZIeTaa	it is normal you are going to have all kinds of cramps and pain thus far in pregnancy,good luck|`|j9axB0YMaa	I'm 29 weeks and have had the same pains. I had a lot of pressure down low, especially when I stood or at night when I rolled from side to side. When I started having Braxton Hicks about every 15 min. my Dr. put me on procardia and I fell 90% better. I get the sharp pains in my vagina too sometimes my best friend told me that it's the two nerves that run down the sides of your vagina being irritated by stretching. Made since to me.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	i be feeling the same thing, i have for maybe 3 weeks now, i'm almost 35 weeks and nothing has happened, sodon't worry, i'm sure this normal, but i just can't tell u what it is, sorry!|`|plHzcNq7aa	Im 31 weeks pregnant and i can tell you that it is normal. It is from the babys weight pushing down. It really does suck, and there is really nothing you can do about it. but if it gets too bad you should see a doctor just to get checked out. Hope you feel better. My baby is laying on my siatica nerve.....OUCH!!!|`|RKJIYTtJaa	Well the pressure in your pelvic area is very normal, the baby has to move down to be delivered. The sharp pains in your vagina are probably contractions. I had pains when i was pregnant and thats what the dr said they were.|`|XWPAjxsGaa	Hi, im 35 weeks pregnant and i have that aswell.. its normal.  To me sometimes it feels like the babys leg is just hanging out or something.  I think its your baby pushing on something because there is not much room left for your bub to grow.  Goodluck x

I have a pop up tent for them for privacy in the living room. Before I bought the tent, I would set chairs up and drape sheets or blankets over them for a homemade version. They would eat popcorn and watch a scary movie with the lights out except for some flashlights.   I also supplied junk food and ordered pizza.  Believe it or not, they make their own fun. Every time I put out games or craft supplies, they wouldn't use them. Watching youtube videos, dancing crazy and giggling always seemed to keep them busy and content.|`|m1GEP2Ydaa	Hahahaa.  Well I am a 12-year old girl so I'll try my best to help.  This is for girls sleepovers.    1. movies and popcorn. do recent movies that just came out, or really good one.  2. music, music, music. put some music on.  3.

i14OCbU3aa	I knew I should have worn a condom|`|KDb96QS7aa	It will depend on the person and their personality.  Personally I told everyone I knew and loved because I figured if something awful did happen to the baby, I would need all those people there to console me - I didn't want to have to hide the pain if it happened.|`|uaiYpt6Iaa	i told my family @ 8 weeks after hearing a heart beat and then @ about 12 or 13 weeks started telling friends. everyone else found out when my belly popped out. of course it's a personal decision|`|OKSeZwV1aa	My advice to you is tell who you would want to know if something did happen... bestfriend, mom...|`|zcSAWWCkaa	i just waited until after my first doctors appt|`|hP6SKYCAaa	OMG!OMG!OMG!

I would try to hold out!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i think telling friends and family when ever u want to or feel most comfortable sharing ur happy news. if anything happens they will be there for u congrats and good luck|`|6L9jJnchaa	I think that waiting until 12 weeks is wise.|`|5H5iQfW4aa	well i tell them as soon as i find out cause im so excited lol  i tell them before after 3 months you still arent safe something could happen after 3 months so jus tell them as soon as you find out|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	i told my parents, close family members, and close friends when i found out i was pregnant. then after i saw a heartbeat i told other people..and of course when i HEARD the heartbeat i told everybody! its just a personal decision. whatever you feel comfortable with.|`|KjF0p72naa	Hehe you secret is probably out then. Congrats, hope it goes well, very good on the not smoking btw and tell em when your moment to absorb the joy FIRST as the baby's mother has been taken in.

We figured the more people that knew = the more people that were praying for us!|`|mPTBU0QDaa	We told our families at 7 weeks because I was sick and wanted people to talk to. We told our friends & extended family at 11 weeks because we were visiting all of them on vacation. I liked waiting to tell everyone because then I could be relaxed and happy about it and not worry that I had told too soon.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	we told  our family and firends right away.  there was no way we could keep it a secret, we were very excited but also we figured that if i did misscarry we would need the support anyhow.  we kept it from the people at work until 3 months though.|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	Finding out you are pregnant probably sends a flurry of emotions through your body. You might expect to feel nervous, excited, surprised, scared, delighted and many more emotions. After the bottom of your stomach drops out when the pregnancy test turns positive, you may be excited about spreading the news that you are expecting a baby.    Probably the second person to know that you're expecting will be your husband or partner. There are many creative ways to make a pregnancy announcement to your honey. Finding a way to tell him in an unexpected manner can be fun. Or perhaps he was the one holding your hand while the pregnancy test ran.    Those are the easy decisions. The next group of people you may tell will be your family or close friends. From that group you move on to acquaintances and finally you tell anyone who will listen. While this is typically the order in which most families share the news of their pregnancy, you may wonder if you need to put some time between getting the big news and sharing it.    When to tell others is a hotly debated topic. Sharing the joyous news of your pregnancy is a very personal decision. Some choose to share the good news early and often. They will tell anyone who will listen. Before the pregnancy test stick has dried they are on the phone calling their friends and family.    The other extreme is to tell no one. This group may also wait to tell until they have reached a predetermined point in their pregnancy. Then they may tell only on a need to know basis, often waiting until their expanding abdomen shouts the news for them.    Both sides of this coin have a point. Here is a break down of some of the issues on each side:    Advantages to Telling Early    Lots of support early in pregnancy   Able to share your good news and excitement   Earlier offers of physical help   More advice from others about practitioners   Help with early decisions   If you miscarry, you will have support from everyone   Disadvantages to Telling Early      Too much advice   Good news travels fast, you may not be the first to tell someone     If you miscarry everyone knew you were pregnant   Advantages to Waiting to Tell    Time to digest the news   Make decisions without input of others   If you miscarry you don't have to retract the pregnancy announcement     Disadvantages to Waiting to Tell    No help/support from others   If you miscarry everyone wonders why you are sad, and you have to backtrack your explanation     As you can see there is not a clear-cut answer. You might choose to tell early, knowing that if you had a pregnancy loss that you would need the loving support of family or friends in the grieving process. You may wish to wait until the risk of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy has past before sharing the news of your pregnancy. There is not one right answer. What works for your family is the right way for you to share the good news.|`|j9axB0YMaa	I told a few people as soon as I found out. Like my best friend, my mom, my sister. I figured I would tell them anyway and need there support if I had a miscarriage. But I held off until I was 12 weeks to tell everyone else.|`|bLluZIeTaa	u think that you should go ahead and tell people,i told everyone i knew as soon as i found out by taking 3 pregnancy tests,good luck|`|nsGBwXCTaa	I would tell every one .When I found out that I was going to have a baby man I call everyone that is something to be very happy . Not to scare you but anything could happen at anytime . But you have done right you quite smoking and that is good . Girl get on the phone and tell everyone. I do not no you but I am very happy for you.   Way To Go
Xngq54vBaa	Make  homework time happen at a set time each day.  It's not negotiable.  You come home from school, have an hour to play/unwind/get a snack and then you have to do your homework.  Make sure there is a quiet place in the house with all the supplies she needs ready.  It could be at the kitchen table so you're available for questions while getting dinner ready if you don't have younger kids, or in a study/office if you have younger children.  The consistency of habit makes it less of a daily battle.  Have her leave out her completed homework and her daily homework log for her dad to check when he gets home/after dinner and let him deal out the consequences/make her finish up if it's not done in the alloted time.      Being a teacher myself, I hate it when every one of my 25 students' parents want daily updates on their child's progress.  5 minutes x 25 kids = all the time I have for planning that I'd rather spend creating lessons for the kids.  That said, check in with the teacher and find out if the assignment log can be sent home weekly so you can double check what your stepdaughter is writing down.  At our school, we put the next week's assignment (and any long-term projects) online each Friday.  If you know she's completing all her work at home, then she should be able to take it to school and turn it in.  A weekly e-mail from the teacher when she misses assignments is much more doable and should result in privledges being taken away over the weekend.    Thanks for caring about her enough to stay on top of her work!|`|gx4s68s8aa	Does she have an assignment notebook- a place where all her homework is written down for the day.  Hopefully she does.  If not then one needs to be started.  So get in touch with the teacher and start a notebook or a calendar in which all her daily *weekly"  assigments are written down.  Then you, and her dad will know exactly what is expected for each night.  As she finishes an assignment then mark it off.  Allow breaks in-between assignment for snacks, a little TV etc.    Then you can also set up a reward system.  For instance she completes all her assignment in a week and you go out for pizza etc or she gets to buy a movie or a prize- anything that will motive her.    It is really important that she gets into go habits right now.  Because she is getting close to the point in school, where it is just going to get tougher.  The sooner she gets these good study and work habits the better her grades will be and the better she will feel about her schooling.    This method works very well if the parents stick to it.  I should know, I before I was SAHM I worked as a teacher's assistant in a middle school.|`|gILygKvRaa	i agree with the first girl|`|mPTBU0QDaa	Keep enforcing! Parenting is a tough job, and sometimes you won't see results for YEARS! I've heard of parents dealing with this all through high school, and they felt like the meanest parents, like they were always coming down on their kids, etc... and then 10 years later, their kids, who were now successful and responsible, thanked them. Do not back off. Parenting is not always fun, but it is up to you to make sure that your children do the right thing and suffer consequences when they don't. Otherwise they'll never learn how to live in the real world! Keep up the good work!|`|DiuhDU6xaa	As long as your husband is backing you up in front of her, keep enforcing. If it were just you telling her to work, she might adopt an attitude of "You can't tell me what to do, you're not my mother". Good study habits are best learned young.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Wel it may come down to rewarding her for doing it and when she doesn't she will lose out on priveledges she would normally have. Take those things away that she enjoys the most. I guarantee after awhile she will learn. Reward systems still work at this age. ood grades receive so many stickers or money and afterawhile she can do something special with friends or buy something she has been wanting.     Not getting goods grades or fighting on the homework she won't be able to watch television, listen to music, less computer time. Mom and Dad have to be on the same page and consistant.     School for her is like work for you guys. You don't do your job at work you get in trouble and soon you fail and maybe even get fired.    Also make sure this work is not too hard for her or too easy. If she needs a tutor check into that. Find out the true reasons why she isn't doing it. Is she bored, is she just be defiant for other reasons, is it too hard or too easy, etc.|`|eeKp9mStaa	find a school that doesnt make their students do homework. when you find it, tell me so i can enroll there are soon as possible!    homework is unnecessary in my opinion... we have to do so much work at school, and then on the weekends we're forced to do more work! i have a whole assignment to do over the weekend and it sucks.|`|HrH0HDONaa	the teacher must let you know, even if by personal phone call, when your daughter isn't doing well. we all know teachers are super busy but you could ask her to shoot you a quick email each day to let her know how your daughter did, and if it wasn't good, there needs to be consequences at home, even if you have to strip her of all her privileges. if an email a day is too much for her teacher, maybe once a week would be better. if your daughter won't be responsible for her work, you have to make her want to be by not letting her have any fun until she has it straightened out. i mean, what is she doing when she's not doing her homework? watching tv? playing a game? hiding in her room? chances are she's finding something more fun to do than homework, and you just need to stop it. not easy, sorry :( have you watched super nanny lately? she has a book too, just google super nanny. good luck!    EDIT: i agree with the above two also! homework bites but you also have to teach her that we all have to do things we don't like to do. maybe help her find the value in challenging herself and setting goals and accomplishing them, and the value of trying hard and failing and then trying again. then reward her for doing her best, not her grades, with something fun like going to the theater or the arcade where you two can spend some time together. she might dislike you right now for coming down on her about it, but as long as you stay positive and reinforce her good qualities, she will love you all the more when she's grown because she'll understand that you wanted her to be the best she could be. ya know? hang in there!|`|CLvc8teXaa	YES! Keep inforcing. If you don't make a big deal out of the situation, she will thinking that not doing her homework is a big deal. This might sound kind of weird but, maybe telling her if she does her homework and improves her grades she will get rewarded. Like giving her some pocket cash for grades or just taking her to go get ice cream will make her more motivated. When she gets into 6th and 7th grades, she will automatically know to do her homework without getting a reward.|`|b6QG2hQ3aa	if all else fails bring out the belt.  physical beat downs are the best form of teaching, so if she refuses to do her homework, give her a slash on the back to let her know you arent playing around.  if she continues to refuse, you can begin severing off her fingers, then move to the toes.  make sure she still has enough blood in her body left to finsh her homework though.|`|9taVf4wbaa	don't do anything just let her father make the rules|`|ZLm3biNXaa	Get on her and stay on her because it is all about learning the right way.  We also have had a lot of luck with having our youngest (and the one most resistant to school work) doing his in the kitchen while we cook dinner. It allows us to keep him on the work and it allows him to get help without interruption.    Good luck. Don't give up.
vGxipYJnaa	Hiring a babysitter who is your age is entirely inappropriate - if she doesn't think you're mature enough, why would someone else your age be mature enough? If she felt you needed a babysitter she should hire an adult.     People can wet the bed at all ages and it's not uncommon after traumatic events. I don't think that has anything to do with your maturity level.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You do not need a sitter at your age.   But you should see a doctor about the wetting problem.|`|6ZU8Kt20aa	You don't need a babysitter at thirteen.

About the bedwetting, I wet my bed until I was 11.|`|WuL6Al3faa	I personally think you should piss on the babysitter your gigantic and deserve to get your face raped|`|yXqyiplnaa	Well, I most 13 year olds should be able stay homealone . unless she's going out really late and then i could understand a little bit. maybe she'd just feel safer knowing there was someone else in the house. my question Is she only wanting you to have a sitter because of the bedwetting??? if thats the case, then that seems silly, because that doesn't neccessarly mean you are immature. But she could want you to have one for other reasons besides the bedwetting.    If you want her to think your mature enough I'd show her you can be. show some responsiblity. do things around the house with out being asked. make sure you take care of your own belongings. keep up with your grades at school. listen to them. only you know what you need to work on, but once she knows you can be responsible, maybe she'll reconsider.
b26Dp8LKaa	If I know what state/country you're in, I can narrow the search options. Six states have open records, which means adoptees born in those states can get a copy of their original birth certificate upon request.      For the other 42 states: Begin with what you DO know. Make a list of your birth statistics. Birth date, birthplace, hospital, adoption agency, etc.    Contact the agency that handled your adoption to request your non-identifying information. Ask the agency if they have a form for you to authorize the release of information to birth family looking for you. There could be a letter in the file authorizing contact with you.    Find out if your state has an adoption reunion registry. If so, enter your info in that state's data base. Enter your info in the following registries:  http://www.isrr.net/  http://registry.adoption.com/    For a list of search tips in your state:  http://adopteerights.net/nulliusfilius/?...    Check here for search help:  http://www.bastards.org/library/search.h...  http://www.adoptioncrossroads.org/  http://prairieguy.wordpress.com/2007/07/...    For support, here's an online forum for adoptees:  http://www.adultadoptees.org/    Keep a log, journal or binder of your search contacts & results. This serves as a map to where you've already searched & what your next steps are.    You may find clues about your 1st mom in your non identifying info, her age, etc. Check high school records in the town you were born in (classmates.com) or college records, depending on the age. Put on your detective hat, begin collecting clues & slowly build a picture. You'll be amazed at what you can find!    ETA: It took 3 months from the time I sent my 1st letter to 1st contact. That was b4 the internet! LOL My 1st mom was waiting, hoping & happy I found her. The whole fam on her side knew about me & were waiting 4 me to find. She didn't feel she had a right to search 4 me. I went into it knowing she may not want to meet me, prepared to respect her wishes, & hoping 4 medical info. So it was a happy surprise. Of course it was a closed adoption. There was no other kind between the 40's until sometime in the 80's.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Sounds like this was a closed adoption. She may not have wanted to be found at the time.   Can you get an original copy of your birth certificate? Her name will be on that.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	First of all, in order for the following suggestion to work, you must be at least 18. Secondly, keep in mind that it may take years for you to locate your birth mother. Now then, that said, here's my advice:  Find an Adoption Reunion site. Many of them are free, some are not. You may wish to register with more than one to further your chances of finding your mother. If this fails, then you may perform what is called a confidential intermediary. What this means is that you will need to petition the court to unseal the information contained in your adoption record in order to find your birth mother. Then you, or a hired P.I., can search for her. Keep in mind that in the intervening years since she gave you up, she could have married, moved out of country, or even, in a worst case scenario, died. Also keep in mind that your birth mother may not want to be found. (This happens very rarely, but is something that should be kept in mind.) More likely, though, she is just as anxious to meet you as you are to meet her. Good luck!|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Hi, Jake. The links Robin provided you with are very helpful. Just wanted to dispel a few myths that have been quoted here.       MOST first mothers DO WANT to be found. Closed adoption is the norm, and it has nothing to do with the first Mom, it has to do with the adoptive parents and/or state laws.      Register on every site you can with your birth date, name, city & state you were born. Hunt around in your parents house, those papers (as far as which agency) are around somewhere. You can even petition the court in some states.      Good luck!|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	maybe the hospital where you were born might help|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	Robin has given you some great advice.  Please ignore those that say that your mother may not want to be found.  You have a right to your truth. Many will try to talk you out of finding that truth - but I say - GO FOR IT!!    GOOD LUCK!|`|LgMoGUoqaa	The internet is a powerful thing.  Perhaps if you were to pose a question on Yahoo with some details you know but not all of them to see if anyone knows anything.  Put vague points on there.  You never know.  Don't be too specific about anything.  You don't want the wrong person getting your information and try and use it to do harm to you.  Or you can contact the locator.  I believe he comes on lifetime channel.  You maybe one of the lucky ones.  Good luck
