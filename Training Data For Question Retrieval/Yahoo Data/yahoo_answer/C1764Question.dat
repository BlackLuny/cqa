And as bad as alcohol is why not marijuana?   I have never heard of riots, rapes, fights, arguments or a slew of other violent behavior from people on marijuana. But to be legal. I still am not sure on that one. What do you think?

Obama gave DVDs as a gift to the UK Prime Minister when the UK Prime Minister (Gordon Brown) gave him priceless heirlooms...including a pen holder carved from wood from the slave ship HMS Gannet.  Last time I was in London, they had movie theaters and DVD players and video rental stores?!?      If Bush would have done this, the liberal news would have slammed him and called him an idiot...      ...so "CHANGE" includes being unbelievably freakin' ignorant?!?

20090309150030AAXCxYY	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Ann Landers ; Advice Columnist?	Where did she get her answers from?   Did she really think she could judge a situation just by looking at it from outside?   I was reading her, "What Do Children Owe Their Parents?" and it really bothered me.   I understand how somebody can say, it's family, don't turn them in, but if you're in an abusive relationship with your parents keep your mouth shut? That's fcuking bullsh!t!!! Soo if you're an eight year old little boy and your father is sexually abusing you, its best to deny this? If your father hits you repeatedly, and he steals your money from your bank account to buy his alcohol, and he smokes when you're right next to him even after you complain you can't breathe, and he breaks down his bedroom door because it was locked because he was pushing and hitting and KICKING YOUR MOTHER IN THE FACE, you shouldn't say anything, and you should respect your parents because the bible says so? WHAT THE FCUK! What happens if you don't even believe in God? I read this story today in English, and it REALLY upset me. And the best part of it all, is she thinks that, but at the same time, she said you are not obligated to shelter your parents if they can't remain in their own house anymore, even if they were good parents. And she said that you shouldn't have to bring your parents along even if they feel left out? WAIT WAIT WAIT a second! Let your dad beat you, but don't let your mother go shopping with you. If this lady were still alive, I'd have a few words to say to her. But since she's not, I'm venting through a question... so I guess I should put a question... anybody oppose my opinion, or agree?

During WW2, there was a great crime; holocaust conducted by and in Nazi Germany, Austria and Poland. Hitler was a christian.      Why then since the end of WW2 have the palestinians (mainly muslims) been paying for it when they had nothing to do with it and were occupied by the british after WW1 following the destruction of the Ottoman Empire?

20090309143954AAxtZHA	News & Events;Current Events	Why did Obama give cheesy DVDs to our greatest allie instead of a thoughtful gift?	Tradition is that when a new President meets our allied leaders for the first time, they exchange gifts. USUALLY, these gifts are of some sort of significance and importance. Something that takes THOUGHT.   The British PM gave Obama some very though out gifts. Obama gave him........a 25 dvd set of Classic American movies!!!!!!??????????  And get this............THEY DIDNT EVEN WORK. Obama didnt give him the right Region code DVDs so they would play over there.   Why is Obama treating out ALLIES like this?!   And why did he give back a bust of Winston Churchill we received from Britain after 9/11 as a gift?!  What is with this guy?  How can you treat our allies like that yet want to talk with our enemies!?    What a message to send to our allies when thousands of British soldiers are fighting beside our troops.

Maybe its because all the people who support Hamas and their "right to exist" conflicts with their opinions on Darfur so they just ignore it. This is typical of media propaganda.
