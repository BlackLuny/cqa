F08HDRvraa	Yes, all those types of salons offer coloring services.  Although you can usually walk in for hair cuts, I would call the salon to make sure you don't need an appointment for a color.

Your skin is likely flawless right now. But if you want try a little mascara and then Burt's Bee's chapsticks... but the color/tinted ones. They're super moisturizing but have a lot of pigmentation. That way you don't look like you're trying to hard (if you used a lipstick).|`|P6SpWWHraa	You can try Benefits some kindda gorgeous.

MHTIe6hTaa	noo it's not going to come out orange.<br>  <br>  It'll actually come out looking brown since you had it bleached but it will fade really easy and in a couple of weeks it'll be almost blonde again, and you'll have to re-dye it.|`|EGcMzg0Paa	the only way to be safe is to go to a salon and they will use 2 different dyes to make it all even. other wise you risk efin it up. believe me, ive done it enough times ") good luck|`|6DnvfpZTaa	The blonde bits will go green if you put a brown dye straight over the top, you need to re-pigment your hair using a red dye first before you can dye over it.<br>  The darker parts of your hair are gonna cause you problems if you hoping to dye it a light brown, i suggest a dark chocolate brown dye that way it will blend all the colours giving you a more even look.<br>  You can use a cheaper brand of colour for the red to re-pigment as you will be coloring over the top of it with a brown anyway, but i would suggest spending a bit extra on the brown and making sure its a good quality dye as its going to be the finished result.<br>  Hope this helps x|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	it wont go orange it will go greeny colour!!! what you need to do is to buy 2 dyes....a brown that has red tones to it and then the colour brown you want......this will make sure you hair does not do green and also add warmth to your hair (u wont see the red by the way) <br>  <br>  if you just put a flat brown on it will also fade very fast and be uneven to the dark you have underneath good luck :)|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Uneven. The brown won't take well to the black dye, but it will take very well to the bleached sections. Your hair will be significantly lighter where you bleached it.|`|q1NGyaBraa	it sholud be fine but depends on the brand of dye.

You have to make sure you give each side a rest so you don't burn on your back and not tan at all on your stomach!<br>  Be careful at the beach - wear sunscreen!!

kfvmQBbhaa	I did some research and talked to my doctor to find the most common causes of acne.<br>  <br>  ? Hormones: The number one cause of acne is the production of sex hormones, known as androgen, that begins at puberty. This is why majority of acne sufferers are adolescents and teens. Hormones are responsible for then acne flare-ups during menstruation and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  ? When the sebaceous gland is stimulated by androgens, it produces extra sebum. In its journey up the follicle toward the surface, the sebum mixes with common skin bacteria and dead skin cells that have been shed from the lining of the follicle. While this process is normal, the presence of extra sebum in the follicle increases the chances of clogging — and acne.<br>  <br>  ? Stress: can also cause the production of hormones, such as cortisol, which can aggravate acne. Stress brings upon different hormone levels. With hormone changes the body prompts the skins oil glands to enlarge, secreting more oil. Which causes white heads, black heads and pimples.<br>  <br>  ? Oily or heavy make up: Heavy make-up clogs the pores and oily make-ups add more oil, which only adds to the problem if oily skin already exists. Cosmetics, especially certain moisturizers, foundations and pomades contain lanolin, petrolatum, vegetable oils, butyl stearate, lauryl alcohol and oleic acid.<br>  <br>  ? Certain medications and steroids: Vitamins are good for your body, But an excess of vitamins B1, B6 and B12 can cause acne flare-ups. These vitamins are good for the skin, but avoid overuse.<br>  <br>  ? Diets: For some people, a diet that is high in refined carbohydrates and sugars can actually aggravate their acne.<br>  <br>  ? Over abrasive cleansing: Harsh exfoliators can damage skin and spread infections.<br>  <br>  ? Picking and squeezing: This can actually send the infection deeper into the skin and can cause scarring.<br>  <br>  ? Environmental irritants: such as high humidity and pollution. High humidity actually causes swelling of skin. Pollution is of course is a big cause for clogging your pores.<br>  <br>  ? Genes: Family members who are also acne sufferers. Acne is inherited and severe cases known as cystic acne usually come from heredity.<br>  <br>  <br>  And..What the skin needs is a product that clears pores and kills bacteria, thus preventing hair follicles from clogging and turning into acne. This is what you should be looking for if you want to get rid of those ugly acne.<br>  <br>  Before trying any treatment, I suggest you read this informational source that listed the most effective acne treatments available:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.17acnetreatments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.17acnetreatments.com</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps   ;-)|`|m5N8Ur6Daa	From what I have read, there is no direct correlation between foods and acne, unless you are rubbing oil from the nuts all over your forehead. Maybe you haven't been rinsing your shampoo/conditioner out very well. Put a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment gel on them. BP can be very drying so you might want to mix it with a little lotion.|`|BZJGNFymaa	It could potentially be Rosacea, a skin condition.  My mom has it, she gets some pretty nasty redness/occasional pimples.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.internationalrosaceafoundation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.internationalrosaceafoundatio...</a><br>  <br>  In any case, if you can't think of a logical reason for the sudden break outs, make an appointment with a dermatologist.  He or she can tell you what's going on, and hook you up with a product that will treat it.|`|8oKazGVGaa	pro active............|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Don't wash your face everyday. Doing that just causes more dead skin to clog your pores. <br>  <br>  Also, try not to wear your hair up in a tight ponytail often. That can cause skin to get oily and more acne-ridden.|`|SWTPNiPOaa	maybe you never know. your skin is starting to get more oily due to the products you use. try what i do every morning i wash my face including my forhead with warm water. then i use a soap like dove which cleanses your skin and leave it there for 1 minute. then i wash it off with warm water. then i wash my face with cold water. see the warm water washes off all the dirt and crap on your face and opens up your sparkling pores but the cold water causes you pores to close up so that your face is nice and shining! make sure you do this before you go to bed and when you wake up. and if you can use a most. with alpha or beta hydroacids or whatever. they will work wonders for your skin. ask you local walgreen or walmart and ask what kind of ones they have and choose the one best for your skin :) hope i helped!

She had to dye/ bleach hers multiple times and there are still hints of red.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but a salon is the best for your hair|`|tw6qP6S0aa	Okay first of all 'Cause as little damage as possible' dyeing your hair to begin with kind of did that, and I suggest just dyeing blond, but it probably wont look the same....|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	Unless you want a really ugly color of hair, go to a professional. If you can't afford it, google ideas.|`|ySMLLbhgaa	People will tell you to use color removers but in my opinion they don't work that great. Really. I just did this.<br>  Your best bet is to just bleach your hair. Go to Sallys, if you have one, and get bleach and you will also need a color toner.  Bleach is bad for your hair yes but you kind of have no choice. Its not going to kill ya. Ive done it many times. Do NOT use a 40 developer though. Use 20-30. 40 might kill ya ;). You will bleach your hair, possibly a few times, and then put color toner on it to get the orange out. Get whatever color blonde your want as a toner. But ask the people at Sallys if thats where your going. Most of them know what there talking about! Don't bleach your hair more than 3 times in a day in my opinion. I had to do this and trust me you can live with having orange hair for one day in order to get what you want. hope this helps!|`|AAMdfdZEaa	I personally have never paid any one to dye my hair.  Successfully I have never fried my hair. When my hair starts to dry out a little I mix up mayo, a little bit of lemon juice, and avocado's let it stay in my hair for 15 to 30 minutes. Then I wash my hair out twice with shampoo and leave conditioner on for an additional 10 min. Then rinse it out!  Hope it helps!!!|`|3b4aef0d2c6ce16c5b8e2b5a668a75e0aa	no go to the salon so you are not mortified and have to pay even more for correction.

yID9DF8naa	Well, my hair was bright blonde naturally, and then of course I decided black would look better. My eyebrows are very dark brown, too, so don't let them discourage you from keeping it blonde. Black hair might make you look very white and washed out, especially in the wintertime.   But if that's your thing-----go for it. Although I would think a nice, deep, rich red would look really good, or even a chocolately brown. But be careful! It's always best to dye it semi- instead of permanent. I had to cut my long hair super short because of all the stripping it went through to turn blonde again! Good luck, babe!|`|Y71Pj6kfaa	Honestly, i think that it would look  better with black...even your eyebrow color helps.  So yes i think you should dye it black.|`|i11G01Qfaa	Darkest like a Rich Brown i think that would look really Classy on you Especially with your Color eyes ; )|`|ZvOXs61caa	DONT IT WILL DAMAE YOUR HAIR.

F32uPjAraa	Why do you think this is a stupid question? No it won't close over in only eight hours. You would need to leave it out for at least three or four weeks.|`|cSgAJRkBaa	it wont close within 8 hours, u know|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Yes it can|`|c0UhndO6aa	The best advice I can give you is to get a clear one asap .<br>  My friend had the same situation as yours and hers closed and she had to shove it through . So I'd get a clear one . Good luck , hope I helped .|`|AA12075747	It won't close....but it may get tighter.<br>  Just wear a labret stud without the ball on it. I do it all the time at work.|`|GGQ0T4fhaa	Yeah|`|Q8etYn60aa	I'd say probably not.  However, if you keep it out for 8 hours on a regular basis, it may start to get more and more difficult to push it back in.<br>  <br>  It's weird, because different piercings will close faster than others.  I have my ears guaged and they will start to stretch back after leaving my plugs out for about 36 hours.  Yet my other ear piercings I can leave out for months and they won't close.<br>  <br>  I'm actually a student teacher at a high school right now and I have my eyebrow pierced.  Of course it's completely inappropriate and frowned upon in schools for teachers to be pierced, so I have to take it out every day for about 8 hours as well.  I put it back in every night, but it's real tough to push that m*therf*cker back in.  It closes if I leave it out for just one night.<br>  <br>  Have you considered a place holder?  They are like clear acryllic barbells that will hold the hole for you.  If you wear it correctly, the piercing is hardly noticable.  Most employers will accept it; you can get them at most tattoo parlors if you're interested.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, good luck.|`|ULCt58Nuaa	doing it yourself isnt safe not being rude cause you have veins in your lip that you cant see<br>  but if you have a job and they want you to take it out just get a clear retainer you can get it at hottopic or those kinda stores you cant even tell you have a piercing when thoes are in and i know a lot of people who use them for jobs and stuff.|`|T1X3pRt6aa	My guess it very quickly.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Quoted from a previous question : <br>  I had my lip pierced for 5 months and it closed up in 5 minutes after taking the stud out, so whether or not the hole closes up quickly or slowly depends on your body.

I have watched several friends try and fail.  Apprenticeship is the only way to get in.  And you also have to do the other stuff.  All the classes and certifications, and it's very expensive.  As the other person said, it can cost up to $5000, or even more in some cases.  It also takes a long time.  Don't give up if it's really what you want to do, just make sure it is worth it.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	you have to take classes on safety and blood borne pathogens and more classes like that and go to seminars, and have an apprenticship (which you have to pay for) and then take a test and get licenced. its a long hard process because you think its easy to be able to just stick a needle in people, but its way more complicated than that. my fiance is in the process of getting licenced and its way harder than he thought. you would think that you would only use 1 or 2 pairs of gloves when doing a piercing but technically you have to change your gloves at leas 4 times to make sure there is no cross contamination, its really technical. just make sure your in it for passion, not money, because you usually dont make much being a piercer alone, usually piercers have to be tattoo artists also or get another job to live off of. and at first you dont get any money for your piercings, it goes to your apprentice (teacher) and you have to pay him/her. my fiance has to pay $1200 for his aprenticship and thats a deal (because he knows tha guy) usually he would have to pay $3000 some people even charge 5000 or more..so be in it for passion not money. and some places might not be looking for aprenticships at the moment but you could always give them your number and have them call you when they are looking for one, because thats the only way your going to get trained and be able to get ur licence.|`|PvQCD9Aaaa	well, educate yourself as much as you can. do your research, and keep searching for a place that will hire you as an apprentice. impress them the SECOND you walk in to talk to someone.<br>  <br>  also, do no try to pierce your friends and what not.

The reason I say this is because if you're not used to adding it, you add too much and your polish is ruined (unless you add a bit of clear polish, which only works half the time).|`|BxMInUUNaa	When you want to use the thick nail polish, pour a jug of boiling water until there will be enough to just cover the glass part of the bottle.

Some people put it in the refrigerator. I would suggest  buying the smaller bottles, as the ones without it are worse and  thicken up and make a mess of your nails.

zFOC0PZnaa	Sometimes I find that you learn so much more from seeing the world than you ever could at school. Obviously, grades are important, and you shouldn't forget about them, but don't miss out on a "once in a lifetime" trip. Maybe you can do your homework while you're traveling? While you're on the plane or train or car or whatever your preferred mode of transportation is. That way you won't miss out but you can still take care of those grades.|`|HRJDrnBRaa	I live in Canada, stay home it sucks. Think of it this way, if you do poorly in school now, it might lead to you getting into a sub par college and ultimately lead to a low paying job.

hzcJH7ouaa	It really depends on the person, there are so many hair types, lengths and so on out there that it is really different for everyone. You should wash it as often as it needs washing, for some people washing it everyday, leads to it becoming dry as it is stripping essential oils away. Try washing it every other day as this will allow the natural oils to replenish your hair and it reduces split ends and dry, frizzy hair. If you feel like you have to wash your hair everyday try just doing the roots, since they are what become oily or dirty first, this will save you from splits ends since the tips of your hair are usually what are driest.|`|gjteVB2Daa	I don't think it is bad, but why waste the time?  If your hair is short, it may not take too long to dry and style, but if it is long that always takes much more time.  I have medium length hair, and I only wash my hair every 5/6 days or so.  It takes me about one hr. to dry and style my hair so I would never do that every day.  My hair is heavy and looks just as good on day 1 as it does on day 5 or six as I do not fuss with it every day not use hair spray except on the day I style and wash it, sleep on a satin pillow slip and maybe add a curl or two here and there.  otherwise I just brush my hair in the a.m. and p.m. and maybe several times a day to fluff it up or to keep it in place if I have been outdoors.|`|mBVXgRLFaa	no, but it washes out a lot of the natural oils. people with thick hair should aim for every other day or so. people with thin oily hair should aim for every day.|`|x6jQCrxsaa	depends on your hair type.<br>  i take a shower everyday,but i wash my hair every other day.<br>  one day i only put conditioner in it and the next i put both.|`|fcMKOpAbaa	i wouldnt think so. i wash my hair every day, but i make sure to put in a leave-in conditioner after i was my hair and its dried a little|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	If your hair is greasy, then you should wash your hair everyday. If your hair is on the dryer side, then you can skip a day or two.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	depends on your hair type.<br>  but no i don't think it's "bad" for your hair|`|EBaAaQDYaa	Yes and no. It's good to let your natural oils soak in your hair, but don't go too long without washing or else it could get ugly.

It will be hard for you to do things with your hair like they do. Thats just how it is. I suggest getting extensions or something that can be styled and will curl and look similar to the kind of hair that a white girl would have.|`|btpoLu5kaa	Some girls (like me) can just let it air dry while scrunching it every now and again. Some use curlers and brush it out into waves. Some (like my best friend) can do nothing at all and their hair will end up like that. It all depends on hair type & texture & length.|`|HYIwoR6gaa	i see some girls wash their hair and let it hang loose til its dry. some braid it while its wet. some use curling irons. really depends on what kind of hair they have|`|lm5hsjeraa	well a while ago i was wondering the same thing until i got the straightener that curls hair,it doesnt exactly curl it, it makes really pretty wavesss:<br>  its called colorful seasons(:|`|U1HxFmtHaa	k 1 wash your hair 2.do a wash and set if you dont know wathc a video on youtube 3. blow dry they roots not the end and if youwant more curls use a curling iron
pLirJP9Taa	Yes it will help! Make sure you leave it on a long time, too. I used to bleach my hair frequently because I used to dye it unnatural colors (blue, purple, pink, etc) and eventually it did this to my hair. Your hair loses nutrients and moisture when it is bleached, because it is chemically stripping the color from your hair. If its possible, never try to bleach your hair yourself. The bleach that they sell in home kits is just too strong and harmful to your hair. Get it professionally done, it will look better and its worth the money. I suggest you do several deep conditioning treatments on your hair, as it will be fried for good if you don't and will resemble broom bristles.|`|VScRdzJKaa	Deep conditioning will definitely help.<br>  Also, don't wash with shampoo as often as you did before. <br>  Instead use a cleansing conditioner. It will keep your hair clean, but won't dry it out and make it frizz.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	yes it will really help... also try to get a bottle of stuff it makes your hair shiny and calms frizz... also try some gel or mousse... those might help!!!
GqVaHA7Iaa	If all the new growth fell out that would mean you are bald...<br>  What probably came out where dead hairs that accumulated in the 3 months with the weave - no big deal.  I suggest waiting at least 4 weeks, taking really good care of your hair and trying the relaxer again.|`|HeOVyxDtaa	my hair is ruined also =/ im considering getting a weave or extentions, but this made me not want too. id love to know too...

6DnvfpZTaa	Its more than likely that the yrs of bleaching have damaged it and because brown reflects the light better than blonde the true extent of the damage is visible now its darker.<br>  Try again with the aussie 3minute miracle but keep it on for an hour or 2, wrap cling film round your head (sounds silly i know but trust me it works) then gently heat it all over with your hairdryer on a low setting (obviously don't put it to close to the clingfilm or it'll melt) do this for about 20minutes as the heat will help lock in moisture.<br>  You can also wet your hair then add baby oil to it, wrap your hair in a towel for a hour or so, shampoo twice to take out the oil then condition.<br>  I promise you will see a difference!!<br>  <br>  If you bleach it while its damaged, it will break and crumble and you will be left with tufts of short hair where its broken off near the roots and possibly even bald patches,<br>  Concentrate on getting it healthy first.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, like L'Oreal Hydra Gloss ($2.84) daily, and leave the conditioner in for at least 3-5 minutes. After washing and conditioning hair, use a leave in spray conditioner. I've heard great reviews on VO5 Leave In Spray (less than $4.00). Focus mainly on your ends, as using it all through your hair will probably weigh it down too much. Also, do a hair treatment two or three times a week. Extra virgin olive oil works surprisingly well. Leave in as long as you want (I usually do 1 hour, but other users say you can leave it on while you sleep for maximum results). Don't forget to use a heat protecting spray, like TRESseme ($3.99). When you wear your hair back, don't pull it back too tight, and don't try to comb hair while it's wet. Trim your hair every 3-8 weeks to get the dead off and keep it looking and feeling healthy. And last but not least, take your vitamins. Biotin and Niacin are known to promote healthy hair growth. That doesn't mean it'll magically make your hair grow overnight, but it gives key nutrients to keep it healthy.|`|Bi4YpZF3aa	use conditioner|`|MHKwqFfGaa	Sperm<br>  <br>  It always works for me.|`|mBVXgRLFaa	once its damaged, you have to let it grow out. keep using the leave in conditioner, try leaving it in longer if its still not helping. and ideally, i would hold off on bleaching.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	you have to grow it out. there is nothing you can do to reverse the amount of damage you have done. the hair follicle is dead, so it doesnt regenerate. <br>  the one thing you can do to make it APPEAR smoother, is a cellophane treatment at the salon. its basically a protein hair masque that smoothes hair and coats it, so it looks thicker, shinier and healthier.
J5HZMetAaa	Here's what I do, it works perfect for me.<br>  1. Wash your face with a scrub and warm water, to open your pores.<br>  2. take out the nose strip and stick it on, rub it on with your fingers so that it sticks completely to your skin (especially where your nose hits your face, the crease)<br>  3. leave it for longer than the box says, it usually says 10 minutes, but sometimes it doesn't dry that fast. leave it on for 20-30 minutes, until its totally firm.<br>  4. To take it off, SLOWLY rip from the edges, you can do one side with one hand and the other with the other hand, at the same time. Don't rip it, do it very carefully. <br>  <br>  This seems to always work for me, <br>  the key is opening your pores before you stick it on so that the blackheads come out.<br>  <br>  goodluck! :)
m5N8Ur6Daa	Ignore them. Seriously. Noses that are a little bigger or different shaped make you so unique and so beautiful! Ashley Tisdale looked so much better before she got her nose job, and so did Cher. They both had bigger noses and looked gorgeous! Now they look weird. Embrace your nose, because it's yours forever! If you want you can look up "contouring" on youtube and find some tutorials about using bronzer to shade the sides of your nose. This is a tiny trick that kind of works and kind of doesn't. Contouring your cheeks is more noticeable and makes you look really pretty. It might even take attention away from your nose since it bothers you..<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!!|`|7nrhPCf0aa	omg people are so mean! I'm sure they're just jealous.

There are days when all I want to do is cry because I am just so sickeningly miserable over my appearance, but there isn't anything you can do to completely change what you look like because you wouldn't be you!

My advice is, when somebody makes fun of you about your nose, dont get all red,and act like it bothers you. Just say okay and walk away, if you give them something back to say you will make them feel like they've won. It may bother you in the inside, but dont show them.

i2cZDC81aa	Just use a sunless tanner. Not only do tanning beds cause cancer, but they give you wrinkles too.|`|HbQmDGb6aa	I hate - hate hate HATE - how pale I am. Seriously, I glow in the dark. But out of the blue, I've had people - sometimes random strangers - come up to me and tell me how beautiful it is to see the natural paleness that I have. I personally thought it was horrible, but we're all our own worst critic, right? Natural tans, in my opinion, are gorgeous, but the fake ones are almost always obvious and, well, not gorgeous. I don't tan, and I'm starting to realize that the shade I am really can be beautiful. Stay away from tanning beds - even one bad experience can turn out to be the one that causes cancer. My dad had just one bad burn as a kid and has surguries to remove cancerous skin at least every 7-8 months for the past decade. That's why I don't tan - it's just not worth it. <br>  Other people find you beautiful. Accept yourself, and you'll start to love your paleness too!|`|alRLh7yxaa	why dont you like spray tanning? that is not harmful and especially since you just want to be dark for an occasion.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	i don't think it will kill you.  its not like you are one of those types that go 5 days a week.

I can understand the desire to create a tan, I myself having extremely white skin, yet if it's unnecessary then you probably shouldn't.  Also this tan would only be meant for 1 day and after the wedding you might look at the pictures and say, "oh I look so stupid in that picture.  Why did I ever get a tan it looks so unnatural!"|`|nrVy8hNnaa	get a fake tan. If you burn easily, it is very very damaging and you are increasing your risk of skin cancer, even if only minimal exposure. any exposure especially involving sunburn increases your risk|`|mBVXgRLFaa	psh go for it. the only people risking skin cancer are the obsessive ones. going every once in a while can actually be good for you. 1. its good for piercings (weird i know) 2. helps clear acne! :) and 3. it looks good!|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	No I am the whitest Italian =P I am just like you.<br>  Really get a spray tan.

I understand your desire for that perfect tan, being super pale myself, but cancer is not worth that. Ever. Of course, you could be lucky and never get cancer. But do you really want to put that on the line? It's soooo easy to get cancer, even for people who are really careful about wearing sunscreen and stuff. To intentionally expose yourself to those cancer-causing rays is just asking for it. Don't do it! Love your alabaster complexion instead! :D|`|HfA298Jvaa	Why not try the tanning lotions? I know you don't believe in them, but trust me the products sold on HSN work and are phenomenal.  They don't turn your body bright orange and your hands won't stain; it totally looks natural.  If you don't like that idea then go ahead and get tanned professionally, but instead in those hot beds then go to a store location that'll give your a head-2-toe spray tan. Good luck!|`|kR8Ur3Jxaa	HAHAHAHA! No it will not kill you! I have irish skin-freckled and red hair, I go tanning every now and then. Just go for about 7 or 8 minutes in a weaker bed. After 3 or 4 visits you'll have a nice glow and a little color. Just don't do it all the time. BTW some believe tanning can be kind of good for you, it helps with Vitamin D absorption and also could possibly help with mild depression.|`|cKyEX25eaa	well it's ok to tan every day just like if you start doing 3 minutes the first couple days and like 5 minutes the next day and then 7 the next couple days then 10 and then 15 and then 20 you should be fine.

Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation damages your skin, whether the exposure comes from tanning beds or natural sunlight. This damage increases the risk of skin cancer and premature skin aging. In fact, most tanning beds emit mainly UVA rays — which may increase the risk of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. <br>  <br>  If you want the golden glow of a tan without exposure to damaging UV radiation, consider using a sunless tanning product. Avoid tanning beds, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen whenever you're outdoors.|`|lbb4luo2aa	why would you want to change your appearance? stay with you  skin color ,tanning is dangerous, as you have said. stop now before you become a tanoholic!

Meaning wise the tattoo will speak for itself. <br>  <br>  I think if I saw it I would say <br>  <br>  "Kick A** tattoo"<br>  <br>  I would suggest that maybe do the whole tattoo black & shading except the flowers. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  _______ADDED!!<br>  <br>  haha <br>  <br>  Hun I wouldn't worry about "gggG"<br>  <br>  If you notice he/she can't spell, and don't know the difference between the number "0" and the letter "o" on the keyboard so..I think they are the one that should go to school lol.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Chest piece was the first thing that popped into my mind when I saw that, so good choice on the location.<br>  <br>  And I personally think the flowers look kind of crowded (but, that could just be the size of the picture), so you may wanna have your artist play around with that.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I quite like it & think it's going to look good when it's done.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	i would guess your a gang member or someone headed for our prison system held young thug apprentice school. were our young criminals go to become bigger criminals and bigger problems for society. it's a choice so if that's what you want: tattoo up, live fast and die young.|`|m8tm3enpaa	f u have a kid, i think ud better n0t get a tat, sign up 4 sch00I, 0nIine f necessary<br>  <br>  ctu0nIine,c0m, check that sch00I 0ut|`|Z10Oed2faa	its looks nice<br>  get a good tattooist who does good work,<br>  if you have it in a higher quality i could photoshop it on you so you know kind of how it would look and a feel for the tattoo<br>  <br>  and that ggg g should get back in school,anyone who writes/types like that is a moron on the highest level|`|7rD3uJzdaa	I think a coloured tattoo like that would just rock?

To prevent swelling there isnt much you can do.  To make it go down, do not play with it, cold things can help with swelling. <br>  <br>  You can use sea salt soaks yes.  They have H2Ocean mouth rinse, i do not know if they have that at hot topic.  Also, biotene mouthwash is really great.  Just keep your mouth really clean.  Dont smoke, and rinse your mouth out everytime you eat.<br>  <br>  good luck :)
oUFDH0Ztaa	first off you dont want to wash your face more than 2 times a day ( morning and night ) and afternoon just rinse your face by wetting it with your hands and pat dry. <br>  here are some steps that might help you with your acne problem<br>  <br>  1.wash your face with a face wash in the morning. dont scrub do it gently<br>  2.drink alot of water and stay away from fatty oily foods.<br>  3.mid day rinse your face with water <br>  4.get in the sun dont stay in the dark all the time. <br>  5. dont touch your face <br>  6. dont pick at your face<br>  7. wash your face at night. <br>  8. you might want to also get a moisturiser because your face cannot be dry or it will start to produce its own oils and thus giving you more acne|`|SkvHy8X1aa	I have trouble with acne too.  And I've also tried all the products...but I've found that drinking water has totally helped.  That and showering/washing my face daily.  And when you wash your face, I suggest just using lukewarm-hot water, products have actually done more harm than good - for me anyway.  You'll have to see what works for you.

But she never cracked and so I waited till my 18 birthday and got it done. I would try to explain to her that you really want to experience getting and having a piercing. And tell her you'd like to do it while your still young because when you are older and have a job it's something you won't be able to do.|`|PtqjRurnaa	find out why she feels that way.  And depending on were ur piercing is and how big it is try to get her to see piercing scares if any are normally really small and you can't tell unless you know they are there!

Might as well be something you can out grow like a piercing, a tattoo u can never grow out of!|`|uZo5cLscaa	A tattoo is a permanent drawing on your skin, a design or words forever embedded into your skin.

7750e2a3931734c4b80af827937f6d3caa	It's not bugs! :)<br>  It's caused because of excessive shedding dead skin cells on the scalp. There are shampoos to help out. No worries!|`|EFnnqpbDaa	dandruff is a scalp thing, its when the dead skin on your head starts flaking off, its not bugs at all so don't worry, you can get certain shampoos and if you wash it really well and scrub your head it should be taken care on, good luck!

ULCt58Nuaa	Lol...................|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	why u want to shave ur head?|`|rXbtkSBWaa	short hair is ok, but shaved is just too much,|`|e31MCWMWaa	hey bree, don't listen to these clowns above me. If you want to shave your head go for it. the general proceeding of shaving your head is not hard. I have shaved mine all the time and it doesn't take me long. You can get a electric razor and just buzz it off. If you have long hair you will want to cut it fairly short with scissors first. Oh and hair will go EVERYWHERE so be prepared to clean it up. As far as convincing your mom, just tell her this is what you want to do and she should agree with you. If she doesn't tell her at least you are not doing drugs and besides hair grows back! As a extra bonus if you have long hair now and you like to give to charities, donate your hair to Locks of Love. It is charity that takes donated hair to make wigs for cancer patients. I am certain you will look just if not more beautiful after your shave your head... Oh and if you live where it is cold make sure you have a nice warm hat! It will take you a few days to get used to the fact that you don't have this nice warm bundle of hair on your head. But again you will get used to the cold, I promise.|`|cnyU6KXzaa	There is a reason Brittany Spears got bad publicity for shaving her head. But just go to MCRD San Diego or Parris Island, they will fix you up bald real good. Seriously though, it isnt that difficult to shave your head, just take a razor to it. As far as your mom goes, that nobody can help you with, she is your mother and you are the only one who knows her. I don't really understand why you are asking this question personally. As far as "Bald chick aren't gross", it worked for GI Jane, but I pretty much 100% guarantee it won't work for you.|`|JEdP02Oeaa	just giving you my own personal opinion; i wouldn't reccomend doing it. although it is your life and i'm not trying to tell you which decisions to make; i don't think its suck a good idea. maybe you could get a cute edgy pixie cut, those are way too adorable. then you could have fun experimenting with fun different colors and highlights. and whatever you decide, good for you for not caring what other people think!|`|ZY2GT7edaa	hahaha i ttly agree w. the guy above me. i'm a girl, but seriously, i have 2 older brothers, and they think that bald chicks are gross...as quoted in that 70s show by Kelso|`|d0fLx0LPaa	Well, once you're 18 you can legally do it if you want, so you won't really have to convince your mom, and if you would like to do it now just tell her you would like to shave your head and see what she says.<br>   I wanted to shave my head sooo bad for years, but I don't have a "normal" head shape so I'd look odd to say the least. But if it's something that will make you happy then do it because society says what to do too often. But, at the same time don't do it to make a statement, do it because it's what you want. <br>  Now, as far as doing it, I would go to a hairstylist and ask them to do it because it's easier, shaving your own head is not easy.|`|bq7HT1ePaa	I say if you want to do it go for it.  I actually had a really good friend that had cancer and she had a really big party and everyone shaved their heads.  I didn't shave my head completely but left some hair.  I would start with the clipping it very short to see if thats what you really want to do.  If it is what you really want to do then go for it.  If you can't convince you're mom wait til you're 18 and then go for it :)|`|l1DBBxF0aa	i hope your a guy.. not looking too promising by your avatar.. DON'T shave your head.. major turn off you'll look like a guy you won't have sex for months till you look like a woman again. (sorry to be harsh but i be you have pretty hair right now) unless you have lice don't do it|`|Vn8wcSEBaa	Hey, sorry a lot of people are giving you a hard time.  I guess just try talking to your mom, if she doesn't agree with you completely buzzing it off perhaps you can do it really short like Angelina Jolie and your mom will settle for that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hairworld.ru/stars/st12-10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hairworld.ru/stars/st12-10.jpg</a>

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	Sadly, many products for wrinkles are scams and others have proven not to do what is claimed (you can verify that with a Google search) At the most they fade them a little (and for a lot of money)<br>  This  is a proven treatment for not just fading them but greatly diminishing them and largely preventing others from forming. It's low cost as it's using safe, natural oils. Use any, but olive and almond are good.  Massage directly on and along length of line with finger tips or front of fingers. Do over and over quite vigorously for fastest results. It simply rubs them away. Some users reported results in only three days.Try it - you and your purse will be happy that you did!

qxrr69bnaa	The best way to avoid burning places you don't want to burn is to start out slow and gradually build up your time in the tanning bed.  Start out at about 4 minutes and increase your time gradually a minute at a time.  It's best not to tan too often--you need to let the tan develop.  You should always use a lotion when you tan.  The Caribbean Gold line by Australian Gold is inexpensive and can give you good results.  You need to use a moisturizer after you tan.

RsDAGnBhaa	YES haha there is a semi permanent solution to straightening your hair but it costs a bit of money =// There's a straightening perm that you can get from pretty much any salon and it lasts about 5-8 months. Its usually about 70-130 dollars. I considered doing this but...i like my wavy hair sometimes so i couldn't commit lol but its good for you if you REALLY want to do it and are willing to spend the money<br>  <br>  hope this helps >_< good luck =D|`|XTN6ZH2Paa	you can try blowing it out. get wet hair and spray with heat protectant spray. put in some straightening gel and/or mousse and let it dry a bit. then, put another layer of heat protectant spray. get a blow dry and a big barrel brush. use the barrel brush to stretch the hair while blowing (take an inch thick hair, hold over brush, and pull down slowly while blowdrying) do this with the rest of your hair and keep blowdrying till completely dry. spray with a bit of hairspray and brush it through.<br>  (i put this for another question but ur both in the same predicament)|`|Mp1K59ahaa	try a straight perm or get a straightener =)) they both work.. for a couple days.. my hair was curlyish then i used a straight perm and it became straight.. then it became wavy.. but now its easier to use a straightner witth my wavy hair.. so it helped =))|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Save your money and get a really nice straightener if you'd like... but the one you have might not be good enough... try any revlon straighteners or try this 1" conair one thats black and gold... it works really well!!

8THz1sp9aa	They most likely are not completely healed, but as long as you take the jewelry out and put the new jewelry right in you shouldn't have any problems. make sure you use stainless steel or titanium as sterling silver and gold have a lot of impurities and bacteria can get into them and cause infection/itchy lobes/longer time to heal. labret pieces are the best to use as they do not have a regular earring back that gather dirt very easily and that can cause yet again more problems. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=4006" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=3002" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai...</a>|`|zYVCJRMXaa	NO wait the full 6 weeks. even then you are only to be sleeping without them in but wearing them in the day until about 3 months personally.<br>  <br>  Healing it may seem but it probably isnt as fully healed as it should be, premature removal may cause them to inflame causing you to then keep them in longer and clean them longer.|`|X6wFMuu0aa	You should wait the full six weeks.  When my children had their ears pierced, as soon as the piercing studs came out I had a jeweler file the sharp points off of them so they could wear them like regular earrings.  Then I made sure they wore their piercing studs for at least 24 consecutive hours each week.  Usually we would put them in one night at bed time, they would wear them the next day and the next night, then we would take them out the second morning.  By doing this they have kept their holes at their original size and perfectly round.|`|I64JOuMKaa	I only kept mine in for 1 week LOL , then I changed them to studs that I liked.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and change it<br>  make sure you have antiseptic beside you , and the new earring your going to change it to<br>  and wipe the new earring with antiseptic before you put it in : )|`|EyOzAeyraa	The earings are like retainers for your ears just like when you get your braces off, you can take them out for a little while but if you leave them out too long, they will go back and close up!|`|mBVXgRLFaa	yeah its fine. minimum of four weeks.|`|35hviVqFaa	yeah, its only a few days, but start with studs and not very big earrings and don't put the claspy thing to close to your ear.|`|ULCt58Nuaa	Yes you are<br>  and thats really weird i only needed to keep mine in for two

M82dMlAeaa	Red hair isn't very common because it's a genetic mutation and also a recessive trait. i suggest you make a punnet square to look at the different percentages of the colors of hair your children will have. usually a punnet square is accurate if you know how to make one. also, say the percent of red hair is 25% and the blonde is 75% (just making up numbers), and say your first child has red hair. that doesn't mean your next child will have blonde hair for sure because the chance of the child having red hair is still 25%. Most people assume their child will have a certain trait after one is born with the other.|`|sXSgijXnaa	Nope! My dad was born blond, then orange, then brown. Your child will most likely end up brown-haired like me.|`|lD7IIFJRaa	Probably a mixture of both.<br>  Maybe a light brown even.<br>  Sandy blonde. Brown with a tint of red in it.|`|vgHnnTxNaa	This is a genetic question. To be quite honest, red is very recessive. There are many genes controlling the type of hair people have. It really is too complicated of a question to just simply answer.<br>  Overall though, there is a very slim chance.|`|EyOzAeyraa	It depends on the different traits passed on from the parents sex cells, they could have any colour hair in the world..... whichever trait is dominant. P.S. your hair colour can change frol too much/lack of sunlight!|`|zasL8s72aa	I think that hair color is a co dominant trait which means that it blends both of the parent' hair color together|`|YSGKWjqsaa	mayeb.<br>  they are both recessive genes, which means that the gene which is more dominant will end up being your kids hair color.<br>  you should look up recessive or dominant hair traits online to get an idea of your childrens haircolor.<br>  also, if you or your fiance's parents had dark hair, they could end up with dark hair to, because you also carry the ark gene.<br>  but because red hair is probably more dominant, they have more chance of ending up with red hair.|`|zttTOKSkaa	depend on your wife's hair or yours
kCdISEGqaa	Wrecking Balm does work to fade tattoos. It's not intended to remove them completely, but it does fade them.  There are a lot of people that think it is a waste, but, if you follow the instructions and give it time, it works.  I have a lot of friends who use it to cover their old tattoos.  I have not personally used it, but, I do know people who have.  In the beginning, it will appear that it is brightening the tattoo, but, what it is doing is bringing the ink closer to the surface.  Their website is www.reckingbalm.com  You could always take a look and see what you think.|`|7rD3uJzdaa	Contact someone who specializes in laser removal of tattoos and see what they say about it?

CoxTzgHlaa	I've done that before and ended up only wearing the shoes if I was going out to eat and knew I wouldn't be on my feet very much.  If you bought them from a store that has an online store, you might be able to find them in your size.  You can also keep a look out on ebay for new shoes that people never wore.  If they're leather, they will stretch out some.|`|jO8YglNMaa	I definitely think it is best to not buy it. There is most likely a different way to get these shoes without suffering. Here are some ideas:<br>  Look at their online website if they have one. <br>  Look on Ebay or Amazon if you don't mind buying it online. <br>  Ask a worker to check in the back for any other sizes.<br>  If the store has another branch, check there.  <br>  Look around the shoes section for a pair that someone put in the wrong section. <br>  Call another location with the item number to see if they have any in your size. <br>  You could probably find a pair close to the ones you want as well. <br>  <br>  However if all else fails, or you just want a better chance at finding this shoes, leave the link to a picture of the shoe in your additional details and someone here on Yahoo Answers is bound to be able to help you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|XZlFLecLaa	no because then i couldnt wear it comfortably... so then i prob wouldnt wear it ... so i would be wasting money - defeating the point of saving 40%...|`|NeTLzyE4aa	No I wont buy it because I will not enjoy the comfrot.<br>  <br>  P.S.

If you do not want to see any red then you certainly want to use something ash. Stay away from anything that says golden or sunny or warm or honey. If your hair is already colored and you just want to tone down the red go with a color that lasts 12-24 washes also in a ash tone. Be careful if this is the case to actually go one shade lighter than you think so that you don't color your hair too dark again.|`|ASYsSxNRaa	It will definitely cancel out the red. I'm not sure how successful it will be on Asian hair but I'm Caucasian with thinner hair. For a while I had auburn to copper shades in my hair. I died it ash brown/blond BY A STYLIST!!!

But I would see a stylist.|`|hFshgjtuaa	yes just be careful because ash colors are green and you don't want it to grab green!|`|4Pguvjyraa	YES|`|8osMkLe1aa	Yes, ash colours cancel out red tones.|`|c3j49t9Faa	It will but you need to be careful because if you don't have a lot of red it will give you a green tint to your hair.  I would suggest doing a 1/2 ash and 1/2 golden brown to be safe
c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	Double-weft just means that there are two layers of hair track, rather than one.<br>  <br>  Thicker is sometimes better, especially for bottom layers, I find it helps the extensions blend in easily. Still, be careful especially when using them around your crown (top of scalp), sometimes it can come across looking really really fake.|`|78wbrmITaa	It has two wefts instead of a single weft.

Click on my source ( s ) to read more on how to make cellulite disappear.|`|ywer453paa	Cellulite is hereditary. It's something that runs in the family, and has NOTHING to do with weight. There are people out there thin as a rake, and they have it too. <br>  <br>  I'm not a male, so I can't respond to your question. However, I CAN tell you how to fix the problem... or tone down the appearance of it. This can be for you... or for anyone else who may read this! :)<br>  <br>  If you have a cream that is relatively watery... and wont be too greasy, applying it to the area and massaging it in will get the blood flowing and demolish those bumps and ripples. Be careful not to massage too vigorously due to how you may cause bruising or varicose veins. <br>  <br>  Working out your legs will help as well.<br>  <br>  massage the cream in 2 to 3 times a day. Maybe in the morning, again in the afternoon, and then right before bed. After a week your should start to see a change. <br>  <br>  There are creams out there, but they can be costly. I spent 60 bucks on one cream, and although it seemed to work, massaging the cream in did more justice then the actual cream itself.  Give it a shot.

Twist each section and wrap it around two fingers until you can clip it flat to your head. Do this at night and go to sleep like that and in the morning take out the clips and shake out your hair with your head upside down and it should look like the picture.

It is a clear/gel like wash and it doesn't foam a lot so yes you have the right brand ;) It doesn't dry your skin- it moisturizes so if you feel like your skin doesn't have that squeaky clean feel, it's not because it's not cleaning its just because it has more of a soft lotion like base. If you have bad skin/acne, try a more powerful wash but if you were just looking for a gentle, daily cleanse-cetaphil's awesome. If you don't like it try Clearasil sensitive skin daily face wash it won't dry you out.

All you have to do is massage the scalp with olive oil every evening for eight days. Let it work overnight and wash it out in the morning. Also good to moisturize skin. Apply daily to dry spots or stretch marks.<br>  Also a good Hair Rinse. Because the scalp supplies the hair with protein and other nutrients through a network of delicate blood vessels, the most effective hair rinses act directly on the scalp rather than on the hair shaft itself. Of the two main types of rinses (chemical and natural), natural rinses are preferable because they act to stimulate circulation in the scalp rather than just coating the hair with a protective chemical film. Natural rinses repair damaged hair by strengthening it, giving it a fresh appearance. They nourish the hair follicle and promote healthy growth, too.<br>  For HEALTHIER HIGHLIGHTS.. JUST USE LEMON JUICE TO BRING OUT BLOND HIGHLIGHTS IN YOUR HAIR. cOMBINE THE JUICE OF 1 LEMON WITH 1/4 CUP OF WATER IN A GLASS JAR, SHAKE WELL AND USE AS A RINSE AFTER SHAMPOOING. rINSE WITH COOL WATER AFTER 5 MIN. LEMON JUICE WILL ALSO HELP TREAT AN OILY SCALP.<br>  Hope that helps, sure does for me, good luck, :)|`|s63bm0Guaa	Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture shampoo and conditioner.

ZAYubnrFaa	Proactive will work until your skin clears up but after that i would never use it!!! i work in the beauty industry and we would never ever recommend anyone to use proactive. It dries out your skin, and actually strips your skin thats why your skin will appear very red.  Supermarket products are not ideal for acne. Why dont you go see a beauty therapist? They can prescribe you some products and or treatments.  Proactive is not that cheap so why not spend it at a beauty salon because their prices arent as expensive as you think!!!!! Plus you will be getting professional advice n care. Hope this helps :)|`|prfVhRJiaa	This does work (well it did for me), BUT when you stop using it... your face gets worse than it was before...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend you to use it because it makes your skin totally addicted to it.<br>  <br>  You can do whatever you like, but in my opinion, don't because it'll be worse.|`|c3j49t9Faa	It all depends on your skin ... I found it dried out my skin too much so I only use it a couple times a week and my skin is much better in every way.  I think I use it 2x a week and a little more before my period because I always break out then|`|Tx96cpvvaa	i use acne free which you can buy in stores and it really works!!!!|`|HBoLxJWuaa	my friend uses it and she said it worked, but if you stop using, even if you miss like one or two times, then your face will break out worse than it was before.|`|lkySXSjvaa	u might have heard this a lot, but it really depends on your skin.<br>  but i have heard lots of negative comments on this product.<br>  for your blemishes, why dont u try clean and clear productsm neutrogena or olay. they all have excellent line of products. if u want to go for something expensive, try mario badescu.<br>  drink lots of water, excersie and watch your diet!<br>  hope i helped!|`|GZCmyzBYaa	noooo works terrible for most people and will someone please answer my question: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApXTbxYBO5uKFrn.NZvl_Xjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226212005AADNIhN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
m2Q2099Vaa	you cant use an earring, too blunt.<br>  you can't use a sewing needle either, it will get infected so badly.<br>  please just don't do it, i can promise you it will go wrong.<br>  if you get it done professionally (if you're underage and that desperate you can just lie about your age, I was 13 when I got mine), to hide it from your parents you can just take it out around them and re-pierce it when you go to bed and go out, which doesn't hurt. I did this, and my parents don't know and mine's healed now, and I can leave it out for about 5 days without the hole closing.<br>  please go get it done professionally!<br>  <br>  EDIT: and everyone saying you can't hide it is wrong, I'm proof that you can.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	First of all, I've a cautionary tale for you that you may find helpful. Danny De Vito and F Murray Abraham promised to set up a meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss lip piercing, but lo and behold, they send Steven Seagal instead. Now I respect Steven Seagal for his contributions to the war on terror in such classics as 'Under Siege', but I was really looking for a Major 'Dutch' Schaefer to handle my lip piercing requirements. This would've all been acceptable, but Steven Seagal abruptly left to shoot some orphans in the face about 15 minutes into the consultation, which was really inconsiderate, and Jean-Claude Van Damme took his place. Jean-Claude was polite and most courteous, but what I really wanted was the original meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I called Dolph Lundgren and asked him to ask Chuck Norris if anybody had seen Mr. Schwarzenegger, but he was far too busy kicking old age pensioners to fully concentrate on Dolph's reasonable request. Jean-Claude Van Damme, angered at his seemingly inferior status as Chad/Alex Wagner to Schwarzenegger's Major 'Dutch' Schaefer completely flipped out and immediately stripped my wallet of ￡5.83, precisely 1/10th of the cost of a lip piercing. Don't deal with these crooks.|`|mUpQFStiaa	My sister has her lip pierced twice ... I think it's called snakebite's ? It's gross but anyways I just asked her and she said <br>  "Dude are you flipping outta yo mind ? Get it done professionally yo crazy a*s *****"<br>  But ye, she said you can't hide it ether because if you take it out it heals very quickly because of the saliva in your mouth!<br>  Also when she got hers done they numbed it with this freeze stuff so I guess ice!<br>  And an earing isn't big enough!|`|2inq4zHZaa	Earring: NO: Earrings are too small in length and width.  Plus the backings are improper and will ruin your gums.  Not to mention it is probably not made of the correct materials for fresh piercings.  Oh yeah, and you have NO way of sterilizing it yourself.<br>  <br>  Sewing Needle: NO: Sewing needles are not hollow.  Body piercings need to be performed with sterile, hollow needles to relieve pressure and create a large enough hole for the jewelry to fit into.  Not to mention you can't properly sterilize a sewing needle either.  Do you just happen to have an autoclave lying around?  Doubtful.  Holding it under a flame will not work.  Neither will dipping it in alcohol, or peroxide, or whatever else you are planning on doing.  Would you be comfortable having the dentist work on you with a tool he just dipped in alcohol?  It doesn't kill everything. You can still contract diseases.<br>  How do I numb it?: You don't.  They wouldn't numb it at a piercing shop, and you can't numb it yourself.  If you can't handle the pain of a piercing, then you have no business with one.  Same goes for your whole idea.  If you are too dumb to get it done safely by a train professional, then you have NO business with a piercing.  In fact, your parents should be advised to take any sharp objects away from you whatsoever.  Who knows what else you could be convinced to do.<br>  How do I hide it from my parents?:  You can't.  It's a lip piercing.  If you actually manage to get something in your lip, it's there.  You can't hide it unless you wear a mask.  Not to mention it's going to swell up, making it even more noticeable.  It will probably swell up even larger than usual.  I can almost guarantee that you will have a nasty infection soon as well, so when your parents are taking you to the hospital to have your face operated on, I'm sure they will notice it.<br>  Retainers are not going to work.  You can't put acrylic in a fresh piercing.  And if you are going to go as far as trying, you might as well get online and look up the risks of piercing yourself.  Obviously you have the internet.  Ever think of using that resourceful tool?  <br>  If you are just absolutely convinced to do this on your own for whatever stupid reason, then I recommend you at least invest some time and money into the proper tools, and research. You might have a better chance at living when it's all said and done.  Good luck.  Have fun with that.|`|HjKipXPzaa	Most definately dont do this urself.  The reason i say this is you need to do proper placement, if you do it wrong you will cause dental problems and gum problems, let alone infection.  If you absolutely want this done and dont want to do it professionally, look into the kits they sell online.  as far as hiding it from your parents, you cant get the flesh tone ones in until it heals...i honestly dont think you could hide it from them.  Are they that dead set against a piercing? how old are you?|`|ZAYubnrFaa	go see a piercer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  you dont want the risk of your lip getting infected n you wont b able to hide it from your parents. Not the best place if u want to hide it.|`|A1IisrUraa	i would definately not do that by yourself it would hurt way too bad and if your parents don't approve its not a good idea!!!|`|2Q4JgEoQaa	go to a pro.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	earing wont work because the back will tear up your gums.<br>  you need a actual ring or a stud for a lip<br>  and a sweing needle will be too small for a ring to fit in.<br>  and its very unsafe to pierce yourself<br>  only way to numb would be ice, but piercers dont suggest numming a piercing<br>  and you probably wont be able to hide it from your parents<br>  <br>  soo basically you shouldnt do it.

kCdISEGqaa	It can be done, but, when you make it smaller to fit on the wrist, you may lose some of the detail.  I like the design, and think it would look cute on the wrist, but, depending on how small you want it, you may consider a different spot.  I couldn't fit it on my wrist and be happy with it, but, my husband could and it would look great.  Your artist will be able to give you a better idea of how it would fit.  Best wishes!!!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I think you can get it there not that big tho.|`|H3PcFertaa	You need to go to your tattoo parlor and ask your tattoo artist. Take the image with you. That is how you find out everything that you want to know about your personal tattoo, size, placement, detail, your anatomy, what will work, what won't work, what will hold up well over time.<br>  Go!|`|HLmd17r9aa	You could definitely get it on the wrist. They will size it appropriately so that it fits and looks right. That may mean stretching it a little, or making it larger or smaller, depending on what the artist thinks. I do think it is definitely possible. If someone turns you away, just try another shop. Most artists should be able to accommodate to your needs.|`|X9PIqr05aa	you can get that on your wrist <br>  & yes it is the A7 bat<br>  it says it on the pic<br>  and i know what it looks like<br>  its the A7 bat with a bow|`|TDtSZLmvaa	if the artist is good they can make it fit.<br>  it is not a tattoo i would get but if it is a tattoo you like then go for it.|`|FGhtWGquaa	It's cute and if you have a good artist they can make it fit. They may have to sacrifice a little of the detail but not enough to noticeably change the tattoo. Please make sure that this is something that you are going to want 10 or 20 years down the road. My friends got the 30 seconds to mars symbol tattooed on her wrist and not even a moth later decided she hated it even though she loves the band. She also has the same heartagram from the picture and regrets that one as well. Band symbols are not usually the best ideas for tattoos.|`|4ff72b609f0b4ee5002297034b595993aa	It is possible that there is too much detail in that tattoo to work on a small wrist.  As tattoos age, details can get murky -- especially fine details in small tattoos.  I would definitely ask a few artists about it before I got the tattoo -- in my experience if one artist says yes or no, that might not be all to the story, but if several have the same opinion -- you are much better off.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	Def not trying to preach or anything, but do you really wanna get that on your wrist? I'm not sure what your profession or future profession is, but a lot of places won't hire you with something like that. Just thinking to think about. <br>  <br>  Anyways, that looks kinda big to fit on the wrist area. you might need to get it resized.|`|2fZeyRsBaa	I think that's a cool design! If you want to look how similar designs look on wrists you might find my wrist tattoo page interesting.

vLU5f5SJaa	I am African American and I use Beyond the Zone products and I love the products. I wear my hair curly and straight and they have great products for both. <br>  -Texture and Distort and good for a loose and soft curl<br>  -Noodle Head is good for a tighter stiffer curl <br>  -Turn up the heat is very good for straightening the hair with the blow dryer and flat iron.<br>  <br>  www.beyondthezone.com<br>  <br>  <br>  I think the product works for all types of hair.|`|oZtbDrMcaa	I use the Paul Mitchell tea tree.

808228039376c85932e905c16a8dbff0aa	okay, ive been training for a couple of years now, i guess i can share some stuff i know. <br>  <br>  you need to know that there are about three section of abs that you need to train if you want the six pack.<br>  <br>  SECTIONS<br>  the top: the bit where you 're most likely to get winded (i.e. diaphram, under your chest, where the rib cages join onto)<br>  <br>  the middle: under the top section, reaching the top of the belly button.<br>  <br>  Bottom: the most likely place where you're likely to get that "beer belly", (the belly button area)<br>  <br>  (there is another section below the bottom one, which basically extends down to the pubic hair [i.e. the last 2 which make an 8 pack], but that'll be doing into more detail, for now, heres the basics):<br>  <br>  TRAINING<br>  Top:- crunches work best (i.e. NOT full situps, only use enough power to get your body off the ground [untill u feel your top abs working] ) relax then repeat<br>  <br>  Middle:- these support the body the most, go to the gym, get a 10 kg weight, hold it accross your chest (cross arms on top to hold it securely) and find one of those "DECLINE" bench pressing benches. hook your feet into them and start doing situps. in otherwords you should be doing sit ups at an angle (head should be lower that the feet), the weight is only for increased resitance).<br>  <br>  Bottom:- this one sucks horrible, not because it doesnt work and it aint worth it, but because its the most difficult and requires you to do it a lot for some effect. <br>  hold yourself in mid air on those chin up bars and WITHOUT bending your knees, lift both legs toghether up simultaneously 90° forward. (i.e. first your heels should be facing down when you start, after you lift, they should be facing where you're looking).<br>  <br>  these are the basics you need to know, it worked for me<br>  <br>  hope it helps<br>  <br>  ps. dont forget the "sides" of each of the sections of the abs. you basically need to twist your hips in turn after training on each side<br>  <br>  **pps. this information is futile if you decide NOT to eat healthy, its up to you at the end of the day|`|HLmd17r9aa	Start with cardio to lose any extra weight you have in your midsection. Often times people start doing situps or exercises targeting the stomach before losing extra weight. You will NOT notice any differences if you have a layer of fat on top of any abs you may have. My suggestion would go to a doctor or weight trainer to find out what your ideal weight is. You can also check on this website: <a href="http://www.freedieting.com/tools/ideal_body_weight.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedieting.com/tools/ideal_b...</a><br>  <br>  Once you find out and reach your ideal weight, do exercises like swimming, sit ups, bike riding, or even running and you should notice a very big difference within a month.|`|twCu2tFfaa	search 6pack in 3 minutes on youtube. its the one showing a black man's abs
dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	i didn't think they even still made sun in....that stuff is very bad for your hair and it turns it orange.lemons work only with sunlight so if you are somewhere warm they will work if not your waiting a couple of months before using them...depending on your hair color the lemon juice could turn it orange as well...really there is nothing fool proof not even dye.they have gels for highlighting and they work well and wash out but they can be a little goopy until you get it down as to how much you need to use|`|PgQui4jNaa	Sun-In isn't too bad. You have to go gradually if you have dark hair like mine otherwise it will look bad. You also have to have a heat source (sun is best but you can use a blow dryer too).|`|tYKlxn0Maa	Sun-in dyes your hair as well, you just cant control it as well cause the sun will hit certain spots more than others. (often leaving uneven "highlights")  Peroxide lightens your hair, if you were to take a q-tip or cotton ball and rub where you wanted your hair to lighten.<br>  <br>  Best to just go to a salon.|`|s63bm0Guaa	sun in is basically a very gentle bleach in a spray bottle. it does work, but if you have dark hair, it will make your hair orange|`|wLbr0iYQaa	haha i used to use sun-in when i was really little. its okay. but you have to sit in the sun for it to work.|`|J3Ye4AL6aa	Sun in does work for lightening hair but just watch out because if you have any golden undertones it may bring out a tinge or brassyness.<br>  lemons could work as well!|`|hJU59dAJaa	I've used sun in once or twice and it did seem to lighten up my hair a bit.. I know you said you want to lighten your hair at home so you get more of a natural/subtle result but I felt the same and decided to go to a salon and get highlights done professionally. My highlights are very natural looking and not obvious at all so I would suggest doing this as well.|`|j53jCILDaa	it lightens up a little bit. Be careful not to overdo it though..
42c5c01b7c6521932ebcda555b130903aa	Nope. You're just average and normal and healthy. :D<br>  <br>  My mom says the same thing to me, just tune her out.|`|1s3nddaYaa	nope your not fat, and your face isnt fat. id give anything to be that small again. ok not everything cuz i love my son lol|`|KasFZL7laa	you are not fat and your mom must be a real b.i.t.ch if she says that about you.|`|HLmd17r9aa	If your mom tells you that you are fat, I think she needs to get some psychological help. What kind of mother would tell her own daughter they are fat? Especially when you are clearly NOT even slightly overweight. It must be difficult to have a positive self image when your own mother is so arrogant and self-absorbed.<br>  Surround yourself with positive people, and don't worry about how much you eat. You are young and growing, and your mother might just be concerned about her own weight, and therefore trying to prevent you from turning out like her in the future.<br>  I am sorry your mother is so selfish.|`|lGSbjuIuaa	no i dont think your fat at all! :)<br>  thats pretty much what i look like, i think it could be toned up alittle! but not fat! dont let people get you down! :)|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	You are not fat, and your face is not fat either.

0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	I would recommend Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleanser and Moisturizer. It is more natural than the other products, and is gentle on your skin.<br>  Here are some tips:<br>  -drink plenty of water (6-8 glasses a day)<br>  -eat your fruits and veggies!<br>  -exercise (make sure you wash your face after though :))<br>  -do not pick/touch/rub your face<br>  -limit your sugar intake<br>  -reduce the amount of stress in your life<br>  There are also masks made of oatmeal, honey, rosewater and other household products that make great masks! Try googling these items and there should be masks that you can make.<br>  By following these guidelines, you are on your way to healthier skin!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  xoxLina|`|OQ5HAfyIaa	I do, but everyone's skin is different :)|`|pCwGPx0Faa	who doesn't have blemishes on their face should be the question.
AA11901859	She just colored the whole area with black eyeliner, and semi-hard eyeliner is the best; liquid eyeliner would not work|`|az0Z0DIjaa	That looks like it is a combination of both.

uQO1Lx9Iaa	maybe you should pick one thing to put on your face. i recommend just using foundation or just powder...dont use both because maybe this is wat is causing your acne. and yes it does cause wrinkles if you dont wash it off completely. remember to wash your face with a cleanser every single day and mosturize. dont make your makeup look like you have makeup on....make it look natural. if you dont wanna use makeup anymore just drink alot of water ...eat healthy....and wash your face everyday! hope this helped!|`|KyVi3nJnaa	You should go somewhere to get a free makeup application (maybe a department store or MAC) so you can learn how to wear makeup without looking like you walk the streets at night.  When it comes to makeup, less is more.  When I was your age, I know I could have used some techniques for covering acne or determining what shades were flattering for my face.  Also, make sure you ALWAYS wash makeup off before going to bed.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	just make it look natural don't put so much on so it looks bad|`|fIMx3c4Maa	The make up could be the cause of your acne and u probably don't need to worry about wrinkles yet, but you dont need make up at your age. You have to comfortable with who you are. U just have to know that you are beautiful without make up and when your older you can use it just to give yourself a different look. The main thing is to just be comfortable with yourself. if you want to wear a little make up just do a little light eye shadow or blush.  Good luck and remember you are beautiful just as you are especially if you don't force an older look.|`|DC0RbvXdaa	Im 17 and all I wear is eyeliner and mascara. I personally think that you are to young to be wearing all of that make up.. And besides think about how clogged your pores are going to get? Every single time you put on foundation or concealer it WILL clog your pores, and you will most likely get black heads from bacteria build up. If you DO decide to keep wearing this much make up I would make sure that every single night and morning you wash your face or clense it in some way... I use rubbing alcohol and that works for my skin but I have naturally oily skin.. I would look around for a clenser that will work for you skin that you like and start using that twice daily, if you want to keep wearing that much makeup that is. :) Good luck!|`|K7vCWru6aa	O_O wow already? I'm older than you and I don't even wear that!!|`|A33TXjHMaa	heey im 13 too(:<br>  what i wear is tinted moisturizer, concealer if i have a zit, mascara, and sometimes eyeliner. thats kinda a lot of makeuup :p just wear foundation or do the tinted moisturizer thing. i use the almay one and it just evens out your skintone and makes your skin look really nice! and if youu have bad acne then go to your docotor and ask iff they have any prescription stuff.|`|XWhV3U29aa	I personally think that is too much for a 13 year old. Im 12 and i only wear mascara and occasionally eyeshadow(earthy tones, blends in). I think you sould cut it back. I think you could wait on the foundation and eyeliner. You prolly could still use the powder and mascara. Possibly eyeshadow but idk. Its what you choose, if you wanna grow up and be a s!ut then thats fine w/ me. XD|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	O wow. I didn't wear ANY when i was that age.<br>  But i think you should tone it down a bit. Ever think maybe you have acne from all that make up clogging your pores?<br>  Try using less make up, or mineral make up if you MUST keep wearing the same amount you do.<br>  Good luck (:

Kind of like the poppers you get for New Years parties, but rather than coming out of the little bottle like thing they give you, it would be coming out of the top of the ribbon.  <br>  <br>  Another idea that came to mind right away, was a set of hands holding the ribbon in them.

ydHU7gYIaa	um...you write what modeling work youve done. have you worked at all yet? if you havent booked any modeling jobs, you dont have a resume. if you havent done anything put in that youre new to modeling and why you havent worked yet, but if you havent worked at all, your chances are slim for getting signed. when you say modeling website though, what are you referring to? youd better make sure its a legit agency before getting involved with them. most legit agencies require you send in professional quality phots, not upload them in jpeg, so the site you are on may not be legit. remember a legitimate agency will never ask you for a dime.

UbrN5yytaa	I straighten my hair 3 times a week... with heat protection.<br>  I used to not use any heat protection and my hair became so dry it looked so bleh.<br>  But even with heat protection spray, I would limit it to maybe 3-4 times a week.. and make sure you apply a lot. It's better to apply more than less just in case :)<br>  Oh and the quality of your straightener matters too :) A higher quality one is better than a cheap drugstore one.|`|aFnXBpi7aa	Yes, if you use heat protection, it doesn't fully protect your hair. I use heat protection and don't straighten my hair every day. I reccomend if you don't want to get frequent trims to straighten it a maximum of 3 times a week. <br>  <br>  You could put your hair in a messy bun or in curlers to make it curly. I usually do that on days that I don't straighten my hair.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Well.. Your question is kinda hard to understand firstly, but you shouldn't really be needing to straighten your hair twice?<br>  Huh?<br>  x|`|7h4LTjkBaa	you should always use heat protection no matter how often you straighten you hair, and yes, it does help. i dont think you should be doing it more than once a day though. if you really need to, use a good conditioner that repairs hair. be carful not to damge your hair though. ( :

TDtSZLmvaa	it really and honestly doesnt hurt... AT ALL!!!<br>  <br>  i have two done in my cartilage. and i wouldnt have known she pierced it if i didnt hear the piercing gun... dont worry it doesnt hurt at all.<br>  <br>  and if you have your lobes pierced, it hurts way less than that.<br>  i will admit, like 5 or 10 mins after you get it done it may sting<br>  just a little but that is the worst of it.... (and by stinging i dont mean like bee stinging like if someone pinched your ear stinging.)|`|DC0RbvXdaa	I've got my cartiledge, tragus, lip, tongue, nose, belly button and 4 in my ears. Weather it will hurt or not is all up to how you can tolerate pain. It does feel like more than a pinch. If you get it done somewhere like at a mall where they will be using a piercing gun you should know that the jewelery may be clean however the piercing gun cannot be cleaned/autoclaved. Most reputable body piercers refuse to use them because of that very reason. On a different note I have gotten my ears pierced (4 times) all with the piercing gun and they were fine, it is all about personal preferance... Back to the pain. They will clean your ear, mark a spot, ask if that is where you want it to be placed, then they'll line up the piercing gun, pull the handle and its over. That part itself most likely wont hurt. Afterwards, your ear will get red, hot and probably start throbbing. Like I said in the begining, weather it hurts or not is all a matter of personal opinion. Hope it helped...:)|`|Vdutn1GYaa	I have a total of 12 ear peircings. your lobe hurts more TRUST ME.I have two cartilage and 10 lobe peircings  all you feel is the "pop" of the earring or needle go thru. you'll notice a small sting, but it'll be all over by then.|`|24sK6L2uaa	You shouldn't get you cartilage pierced with a gun besides the fact that it can't be sterilized properly it can shatter your cartilage. Your better off getting it done with a needle.|`|xxSGhywoaa	So don't do it.|`|Au4gWgEiaa	Nah!  If you are just getting it where most people get it, referred to as a helix, should just slide right through.  It should not hurt a lot.  I remember I was really worked up for that too, as it was my first professional one done.  I found it hurt less than getting my lobes done with a gun!  <br>  The first week or two it will be sore though!  Immediatly after getting it done it will feel very warm and kind of tingly but that will go away by the next day.

Otherwise I would stick to the blonde.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Call a beauty supply shop, the highlighted hair needs to all be segregated, you can foil them to seperate them, the roots will be done first, then either the hair in the foils or the other hair, call a beauty supply shop and they will tell you. Do not use any color with the name ash in it, so it wont go green. This is really a long process and you will need someone whose not afaid to help you so that it will all end up at the same color at the same time.The roots need to all be colored the quickly then start on one side open the foils squirt in the dye reclose each foil then quickly do all the rest of the hair. Make sure you have enough color, unless your hair is short buy two boxes, if you can go to a beauty supply shop they can sell you the best products to use and give expert advice, its not necassarily more expensive either. If you simply cover all the hair at once, there is a good chance all the highlighted hair will turn out different enough that it will be noticable and look like a reverse frost.|`|s63bm0Guaa	if you are going from blond to dark, you NEED to have it professionally done, because there is a step in between the coloring process that needs to be done, its called filling the hair.  If this is not done, your hair will go that muddy ashy green color that people talk about. You need to put certain tones back into the hair so it wont mud out.|`|aFnXBpi7aa	Your hair won't go orange if you're dying it from blonde to brown. I would low-light your hair dark brown or dye it with semi-permanent. If it starts to wash out, then get the permanent and dye it with that.
L5tWiYOFaa	Yes, but firstly, a cautionary tale. Danny De Vito and F Murray Abraham promised to set up a meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss hairdressing courses, but lo and behold, they send Steven Seagal instead. Now I respect Steven Seagal for his contributions to the war on terror in such classics as 'Under Siege', but I was really looking for a Major 'Dutch' Schaefer to handle my hairdressing career. This would've all been acceptable, but Steven Seagal abruptly left to shoot some orphans in the face about 15 minutes into the consultation, which was really inconsiderate, and Jean-Claude Van Damme took his place. Jean-Claude was polite and most courteous, but what I really wanted was the original meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I called Dolph Lundgren and asked him to ask Chuck Norris if anybody had seen Mr. Schwarzenegger, but he was far too busy kicking old age pensioners to fully concentrate on Dolph's reasonable request. Jean-Claude Van Damme, angered at his seemingly inferior status as Chad/Alex Wagner to Schwarzenegger's Major 'Dutch' Schaefer completely flipped out and immediately stripped my wallet of ￡5.83, precisely 1/10th of the cost of a high quality haircut. Don't deal with these crooks.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THOSE COMMERCIALS ON TV?!

NOSWANvNaa	Well first, you have to grow it out. Make sure that your part comes from the top/back of your head. A part is where you pull your hair from. You MUST use shampoo and conditioner everyday to maintain your hair. If it's frizzy you're going to need to blow dry it. if it's curly, straighten it which does not mean that you're gay. but just because you skateboard does not mean that long hair will look good on you. so, if you don't like it you can always cut it off! :D<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! <br>  BTW, i have my hair the same way.<br>  so yeah.|`|85KrSJh3aa	<a href="http://www.howtogrowhairfast.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtogrowhairfast.com</a> is your solution.|`|A7uD0IqXaa	My hair used to be a problem for me too.

Au4gWgEiaa	Get them waxed before you get it pierced.  You won't want to do it after because it will irritate the piercing in the first few weeks to a month.  Eyebrow rings are very prone to rejection and migration, but everybody is different.  It is not written in stone that it will reject in two years, 2 months, or at all.  I have friends who have had theirs for two years and it still looks fine.  Other of my friends have had theirs for 5 years and it has migrated...|`|bpzjkAuTaa	well, i dont have an eyebrow piercing, but if i was getting one, which i probably will in about a year, i think i would definitly wax them. and i have no idea about the two years thing; i doubt thats true, but i shouldnt answer, cuz idk.|`|H77rQYmsaa	No, and no.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I don't understand why everyone is telling you to wax.  I think it's bizarre, and unnecessary.  I had mine done and removed it after 2 years, then redone a year later, and have had it for 5 years since with no trouble or migration.  I didn't wax my eyebrows... that'd look freaky, for one.  If you have really intense, busy eyebrows, pluck them back with a tweezer so that you can see where the top and bottom would go.  When you get them pierced, the piercer will mark the top and bottom and you'll need to see this.  Still, I have heavy-ish eyebrows and didn't bother; it turned out just fine!<br>  <br>  As for healing, I had no trouble at all.  I was diligent and cleaned it twice a day, every day, for 2 months.  I had a friend who did his in high school (when I first did mine), and his got infected, red and swollen and he looked ridiculous. He didn't clean his.  It takes 10 minutes a day to keep it nice and clean and allow it to heal, so I'm sure you won't have any problem.|`|GJceaXXxaa	If your piercing appt. was later than that I'd reccommend getting them waxed but I wouldn't suggest waxing them the same day as getting your piercing. It will make your skin senstive and if for any reason you had a weird reaction, it might prevent you from getting it pierced. Just apply a warm washcloth and tweeze your eyebrows to make it clean before you go. Tweezing wont be difficult, even after you get it. And no, that's not true. Piercing your eyebrow is just skin + tissue. If that was true ears, bellybuttons, noses and whatever else would reject it. Just keep it well cleaned :)

iKuzSQXzaa	I like the long hair better, plus you can do so much with long hair, and if you ever want short hair you can have the illusion that its short without cutting it.

TCpTlCTRaa	If you style layered hair properly it may give the appearance of thicker looking hair but it won't make your hair thicker. It your hair recently became noticeably thinner, it is important to find out why. If it is shedding excessively it may be telogen effluvium. If individual strands are becoming thinner it may be androgenetic alopecia. Most female hair loss can be improved or reversed, especially if it is treated and corrections are made as soon as possible. Essential oil scalp massage is an excellent hair loss remedy.|`|19noB4xXaa	layering of course will only make it thinner.<br>  i live in illinois n an amazing salon to go to is frank girondas|`|fIMx3c4Maa	i have VERY thick hair but when i got it layered it looked much thinner, so this may not be the best idea for you.

KhvVD57yaa	For plaid shorts, you will most likely want to go with a graphic tee within the same color scheme as the shorts. However, it is not imperative that you have everything match exactly.<br>  <br>  For example, if you the plaid consists of navy blue stripes on white shorts, pick a tee shirt (from American Eagle, Hollister, etc) that is either white, gray, black, or a blue of the same shade. You can either have some design or print on the shirt that also coordinates with the shorts. <br>  <br>  Also, polo shirts in a solid color go really well with plaid shorts and are easy to match.<br>  <br>  If you go into pretty much any store in a mall, they will certainly be able to help you find something that matches.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|gDtLKK9Haa	Freaky golfer look ...polo shirt, knit vest (tank top we call them in UK) and knee socks.

A face mask type thing that is also good is mixing oatmeal and natural yoghurt into a paste and applying to the face and leaving to dry. Lemon juice or tomato juice to bleach any scarring. The best products are PanOxyl - Acne Gel and Weleda - Acnedoran. If you use the Pan-oxl make sure to moisturise a lot, as it will dry out your skin, but after a few weeks you'll notice the results. It has Benezol Peroxide in it, which really is one of the best things for acne. Both brilliant products. But you have to give them a chance to work, a few weeks at least.

IVdkNGbpaa	There are a couple of tricks that might help you. If you are trying to take advantage of natural curl then you definitely need to use some type of hair product, Different products have different results for example mousse will give you a softer control whereas gel will give you a more crunchy feel. A smoothing product such as the biosilk that was mentioned before or frizz ease or a silicone de-frizzer will help too. You can use a diffuser which will stop the air blowing the hair straight (and frizzy) but the secret is still to touch the hair as little as possible. Let the dryer do the work. The other trick which is what I do on my own long curls is to clip the hair up in sections while it is still damp and let it dry in the clips, that way the hair gets to dry without weighing down the curl and when you unclip it you can shake and go and the curls look great. If you are trying to get your hair to look straight and silky that is a whole different answer.  Good luck.|`|YbYR4004aa	TRY A DIFFUSER ON THE END OF YOUR BLOW DRYER IT REALLY WORKS AND IT DECREASES THE FRIZZ. TRY A SERUM ALSO I LIKE BIOSILK PERSONALLY. USE A GEL THAT IS ACTIVAED BUT YOUR BLOW DRYER. YOU'LL DEFINATLY NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE|`|OjqApTmzaa	you should use suave.. its works to make it scrunchy or at the store there is alot of scrunchy products that will work..

X6wFMuu0aa	The time for a piercing hole to close up varies greatly from person to person.  It also depends on how long your ears have been pierced and how old you are.  If you ears have been pierced for two years and you have worn earrings most all the time for those two years, your holes may or may not close up.  Also, there is a big difference between having a hole close up so you can no longer put an earring through your ear and having it completely disappear.  Even though the holes in your ears may close up, you are likely to have little dimples on your ears that will make you ears look like they are still pierced.|`|DEIxwvKPaa	probably not|`|1LsJbrBDaa	Don't wear any earring on it anymore and wait for it to heal for itself.<br>  <br>  I don't know about any other alternative ways, but from someone i know, her ear piercing will start to heal over itself if left too long without wearing any earring.<br>  <br>  However, another of my friend won't have her ear piercing heal no matter how long she left it alone.<br>  <br>  So, perhaps left it alone for a long time may get itself healed.|`|RiStkJT9aa	well it takes forever to heal so just wait but it depends on the hole like if you have those big holes the it takes like really long but if its like normal like the normal micro size ones its a few years<br>  answer mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnJWzAULM9Ck4QRA_7jtURvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224233711AAISTfY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Tx96cpvvaa	i don't think so

If you are wanting a more obvious color then your black needs to be lightened with bleach which is most definitely a job for an experienced stylist.

They are expensive at drugstores and whatnot, but I just bought mine a week ago on ebay for $65 (they are usually $100-140).  So I would recommend using ebay.  Chi also make hair styling products.

That way your curls stay curled :]|`|WDS2DASnaa	well a flat iron usually is for straightening not for curling... but they have straightening irons that have a curved top so they can be used as curling irons too.<br>  since your hair is processed i would use a little something to protect it (something light so it doesn't weigh your hair down)|`|s0ec2re3aa	A Chi is the best you can get without a hair styling license(:<br>  They range from $99-190.
CvGEdIUiaa	Well, you will be able to find tatoo shops who won't ask for ID, but on the other hand, those are not the shops one would recommend going to. Under 18 is a no-go, basically, and definitely by law.<br>  Good tattoo shops do ID, and if they don't know you and your parents, written consent alone, without the parent being there, is not going to do it, either. Friend or cousin or whatever is not going to help, unless he knows a tattoo shop who doesn't ID, of course. But than your parents could sue the tatoo shop.<br>  <br>  I'd give the whole thing a night or two of thinking. My parents always said: If you have the money to pay to get the tatoo done, and the money you need to get rid of it again, and you still want it, you can have it.<br>  So: Do you? And think about this: If there are problems with the tattoo, you won't be around the tattoo shop who did it, so repairing it will be difficult. Yeah, tats are cool, but wait until your 18. Seriously.|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	tattoo laws are the same in europe as in the us,i would think in germany more so,they don't bend rules !!going with a friend is not valid.parent or legal guardian, and a written release will not be accepted either.

I know, because I've had the same problem. And don't put your hair in a bun. It'll in there for many hours and so it leaves crinks/waves in your hair wherever its pulled at. So just dry you're hair, brush it out, and leave your hair down when you go to bed. :]

fCSGDpROaa	Ulta stuff is horrible.  You should definitely buy a minimal amount of mac.  It's quality not quantity.|`|lkkUh6eeaa	Ulta is pretty good. There are pretty good brands out there. I would say a minimal amount, Mac is of course fantastic. Hope I Helped! :)|`|te2G9pBkaa	Don't be fooled by thinking that the more expensive things are always the best.  For some things, that's true, but not always.  I'm not sure about those brands, but if you're unsure, I'd suggest asking for some free samples.  <br>  <br>  I sell Avon and mark and I'm a certified Beauty Advisor.  You should try some of my products, I'd be more than happy to send you some free samples.  I have plenty of eyeshadows on sale (if that's what your looking for), and if you're not satisfied with them, you can return them for a full refund, guaranteed.  Shipping is even free (enter coupon code FIRSTREP).  So no matter how you do this, you have nothing to lose,  either you like it and keep it, or you get your money back... either way you'll be saving money.<br>  <br>  I hope you find what your looking for!|`|jVjInjjiaa	U purchased at Ulta but what brand is it cuz I shop there or at Sephora and I've come to conclusions that no eyeshadows beat the Mac ones but if u r looking for similar and almost same quality look for Urband Decay and try to look for the primer It helps with all day stay and creasing but they r good w/ or w/ out it, they have cool popping colors just like mac|`|rzRQuZA9aa	I think Ulta products are pretty good quality and inexpensive.|`|VxbdjKIKaa	I guess it is pretty much the same. I like the brand products better though.|`|tZxnNQGMaa	Get anything from Sephora , its all good inexpensive AND expensive , depends what quality you are looking for. But for sure anything in Sephora is good . All my make up is from there.

6SqxGQsqaa	im currently using covergirls lashblast and I LOVE it ,i have really thin eyelashes and i love the volume. it doesnt clump and its just perfect.  before i tried lashblast i used to use maybeline define a lash volume mascara. that one is great. it doesnt really volumize a lot, but it lengthens beautifully with NO clumps.  i also have volumunous and colossal volum express which works just like lashblast.<br>  other great mascaras that i looooove:<br>  lash maxxx by rimmel<br>  telescopic by loreal<br>  fablash by revlon<br>  lash injection by too faced (purchased from sephora)<br>  and the sephora brand lash plumper.<br>  ive also tried mascaras from mac, clinique and lancom, but i found that overall maybeline was the best because you got the bang for your buck. hope this helps!|`|9N0p5MNWaa	I use LashExact Waterproof Mascara by Covergirl. Its in a purple tube with a blue stripe. Its pretty cheap and available everywhere. It gives you long, thick defined curky lashes with no clumps and never doesnt smudge/fade.<br>  <br>  It has NO clumps, ever, even when I apply 3-4 layers. Its smudge proof, as I arrive home from a day out and my eyelashes look exactly the same, even if I've been rubbing them all day. <br>  <br>  Its also very waterproof. I had a shower after forgetting I'd applyied mascara. I put my face directly under the stream of water, and when I got out, it was still perfect. And I saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and I cried my eyes out, but my makeup was flawless! My friends were amazed as they'd seen me crying, but my mascara was perfect. I even go to the beach with it on!<br>  <br>  Otherwise go with Covergirl Lasblast, because its the same brand as mine, and I've heard great things about it!|`|1qD3fPnMaa	covergirls lash blast!<br>  <br>  its amazing!<br>  it doesn't clump and glides on smoothly and definitely gives volume and length|`|xOYGzkSxaa	none!<br>  get the Bad Gal mascara by Benefit or the Fatty Mascara by Urban Decay|`|RcBkUBsfaa	cover girl volume exact|`|taYFAwlzaa	Covergirls lashblast.<br>  Why? No clumps. Cheap. Lots of volume.|`|dALX1qQdaa	i really like define a lash. the green tube is the regular and the pink one is the volume, both are great!|`|AA10335926	For volume, go for the COLOSSAL mascara in the yellow tube, I think it's by Maybelline. I didn't believe it would work so I went out to buy it today and try it myself because I have test many mascaras in my life. It was buy one get one free at Rite Aide (reg. $8) and it is not bad at all. They have thick, full, and many bristles that helps get every of your lashes. The volume is very obvious after you curl your lashes and apply mascara. I found out that it's best if you only apply two coats, anymore than that, it makes your lashes look falsies...but some people do like that :) it says 9X the volume and no clumping.|`|8osMkLe1aa	I can't decide between lashblast and volume couture, they are both good at volumizing without clumps. Don't get 2000 calories though, it gives length but not very much thickness.|`|RChBFKdWaa	I HATE covergirl lash blast.<br>  It clumps my lashes SOOOO much.<br>  I havent tried the 2000 calories one.<br>  But it should be good if it has long bristles on the brush.|`|J8tYQZ4gaa	get the yellow one from mabyeline i love it! its like volumizer or somethin but works awesome!
82M6qghCaa	wear wider legged jeans, they will draw attention away from your bigger sides, but also make your butt look good. I find with my wider hips (im 5'5 and slim and a similar body type) layering tshirt makes me feel better about myself but still look fashionable. If you don't want to change your alltogether look, try getting funky necklaces that will draw attention to your bustline and not your bottom half.|`|eqDCt6gQaa	flare jeans look good on a cute butt! pair it with a shirt that isnt skintight and with and empire waist. your bust will look larger, and it will hide you hips. <br>  <br>  (btw nobodys happy. i have wide hip bones and 0 fat. i could kill somebody theyre so sharp!)|`|2xzoWMaVaa	Wear t-shirts that are'nt too tight but a good size.Skinny jeans too.Hope this helps.

LOL! its soo impowering =)|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Contrary to what many other people feel, no, I don't feel powerful because I perceive it as just a repetitive 'clicking' sound, nothing special. Although, I do feel sexy in heels because they spotlight my outfit and body-shape.|`|EQVFlUbEaa	Lol, yes it does.<br>  I don't know why. Maybe the heels just add an aspect of maturity.|`|RGG30rbkaa	Yeah LOL! I do that to. Expect I hate when sometimes you trip over in them!|`|wOGUL6v6aa	I agree with all of her thoughts.

9N0p5MNWaa	The make up remover I use is Garnier Clean and Sensitive Delicate Eye Make-Up Disolver. I have really sensitive skin, and it doesn't irritate me at all. Its cheap, gets rid of all eye make up and leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh. You can buy it pretty much anywhere. Here's a picture of it: <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41kFf4HNg4L._SL500_AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...</a><br>  <br>  If you're looking for something you can use to remove make up with using things at home, try putting some moisturiser on a cotton ball or toilet paper and just wiping it over your eye. Try and use a gentle moisturiser. The more oily it is, the easier the make up will come off.<br>  <br>  I use both these methods, but the Garnier stuff is AMAZING! Hope I helped!|`|RChBFKdWaa	Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc-8onVA5Jk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc-8onVA5...</a>|`|itiJVgRsaa	use baby oil or ponds cold cream both are cheap and work great.|`|AJSvGW4Laa	baby oil is awsome n great for people with sensitive skin!|`|cKugDkU2aa	anything oil based|`|GmghrL4Iaa	baby oil is AWESOMMME<br>  i use it all the time. but be sure not to get any in your eye. i always use a q-tip to whipe off the eyeliner :)|`|3nmBkBvOaa	use face lotion<br>  <br>  Neutrogena oil free moisture is good
lcriDvMKaa	Ask for closer thinner foils this will give you a more natural look instead of thicker foils which make the colour look harsher.You will need a full head of foils if you want it to look more natural.|`|OMKDEun3aa	Have her do the whole head, but to place them diagonal not horizontal on  your head  4 sections that will stop the stripey look

WO68RZdIaa	They think that the gangster look if cool instead of completely ridiculous looking.<br>  <br>  Some years ago, I was at a mall in North Carolina & a teen boy was wearing his jeans completely inside out. Not only did he look ridiculous, but to get anything out of his pockets he had to literally reach inside his pants to get to his keys, wallet, money, etc. On top of that, fastening & zipping up his pants had to be a chore in itself.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	They need to air out their stanky britches|`|r1SnWjBVaa	Some guys just think that's cool or they just like to wear their pants that way. When guys do that they still have to wear a belt to keep them up so why not just pull them up like they should be and that way they wouldn't have to wear a belt. I think it's ridiculous myself too but what can you do about it? That's the way they want to wear them then should just let them.|`|Bp5THu35aa	its cute to me because like pants all the way up make them look tight and a nerd...no offence but its fasion now ....i mean evrybody at skool does it even girls but we wear pantsand over it we wear basket ball shorts..or we wear botty shorts and basket ball shorts and sagg.....im wearing it 2 skool 2 day|`|THKwNaU9aa	I agree, I don't think it looks hot or kool at all it looks like they took a dump in their pants.

I would highly recommend against any of them, plus when you get older it will just be a hassle, and if you get rid of it there will be a big annoying hole and possibly scar where the piercing was!<br>  <br>  Also - the tongue is NOT a good place to get a piercing either, as it can cause numerous problems, primarily some nasty infections.<br>  <br>  Just get your ears pierced in a few different places.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a7f44582f7bbfb8996d883accbaf5a63aa	nose ring definitely. a sparkly stud. you have the right facial structure for one of those. don't pierce your lip. it will ruin the pretty shape, in my opinion. don't get an eyebrow ring either. i don't think it would look right. that's just my opinion though. if you want one, go for it.|`|oSVkUzdOaa	I agree that ur waaaaaaaaay too pretty to get a facial piercing but if you insist i would suggest a tiny nose piercing. Just a small stud. That's all  :)|`|uFUKFGwfaa	I don't know how far you are willing to go, but you should definitely get a septum (nose) piercing.  That would look sexy on you.|`|ad14ac684db1a206e4dee1e9b1ee74b0aa	I think a stud in your nose and a brow piercing would be tight on you.|`|rGsHlvtaaa	a lip piercing deffinately. either snake bite, or angel bite. but it;ll look good on u.|`|OKZkABDqaa	NOSE PIERCING! a little stud in your left nostril  :D|`|eAyGUeVgaa	your too beautiful to get a piercing, but if you insist. the left side of the lip would make you sparkle!|`|aShm5yvDaa	i think septum would look good on you.|`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	You are very pretty, beautiful eyes, nice lips.

gu0AxKyiaa	sounds good as hell yo|`|Ra5MSipFaa	i dont think thats going to be that simple to get the flowers to connect on your arms so you might want to ask the artist. how about a ladybug instead of the butterfly?|`|vrt8bMzVaa	sounds cool go for it|`|8THz1sp9aa	as long as this has meaning to you (which it obviously does) i say go for it. not sure why a dragonfly or butterfly represents your dad and mom but i'm sure theres some reason behind it. if not, maybe you should think about what reminds you of them individually.|`|CIlwfiU3aa	Sounds good.. If not a butterfly..maybe a hummingbird or a honey bee..<br>  <br>  I like how the flowers go together
Rf2r23sYaa	If you have not opened the makeup, the makeup is still sealed, and you have a receipt then they owe you a refund. Go talk to the manager and bring your mom with you. Also, let this be a lessen to you that the "free makeover" is never free. They always pressure you to buy something.|`|wmVmNEBOaa	It's your fault for not saying no. Why would you let someone talk you into something you didn't want to do? Be stronger than that. You won't hurt their feelings, trust me. They're sales people just trying to make a sale.|`|c3j49t9Faa	Well I don't know where you were shopping at,  but take it back.  Get a refund.  If you cannot take it back I guess this should be a lesson learned right?  You never buy something not knowing how much it is and not looking at the receipt until you were walking away isn't very smart.  Why didn't you turn around and go back to him once you saw the receipt? <br>  I don't know what your rights are because it sounds strange to begin with|`|zvVwsTT2aa	That sounds horrible! I would hate if anything like that happened to me. Maybe you and your mom should talk to the company-even go as far as getting a lawyer. The seller obiviously knew you were underage. I am sure if you contact a lawyer and tell him your story that he/she will come up with some kind of precedent where this has happened before or a loophole.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps honey!|`|VxbdjKIKaa	Sorry, but it is your fault because you weren't paying attention to the prices.
cGKDJaqpaa	whats katana<br>  <br>  <br>  booty shorts and a sports bra are always gooooooooooood|`|gU3yIZwMaa	whatever you wear, <br>  they`ll probably throw you in a kimono.<br>  <br>  my brother in law studied martial arts quite extensively, and he had his own garb. part of your training will include respect for the art, the heritage, which means maintaining the correct training costume and the correct execution of the moves. the emphasis is as much on fitness, understanding the spiritual and moral philosophy of the tribe as well as the history and different manifestations of the fighting style. then again, he was pretty hardcore.<br>  <br>  if it`s a modernized school, the uniform might be akin to that of an olympic fencer. booty shorts and bra would really make you look slutty, serious|`|7j9MfenOaa	Katana...as in Japanese sword training, correct?  I'm thinking that the pants should fit somewhat loose...maybe sweat pants, as they will probably give you a uniform anyway, but just to be safe...as for shirts, I can't say.  Maybe take a few options and ask...like a baggy tee shirt, and something a bit more snug in case there is a chance of snagging baggy clothing...|`|9vA7pdkWaa	i think u should wear a shirt with a skirt because i think u will look very beautiful with them|`|rXvePmfgaa	haha well i think u should just go naket.. u will look even more sexy!

8d76f8b8e5f5db785811fc316c86ca44aa	Sure they CAN....but should they?  Well, as a mom I would ask why they want to.  Is it because they think they look nice or is it because they want the boys to like them?|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Certainly, but only to certain places. I think it is fine if she just wants them for going out, but if she is wanting to wear them every day like for school then that is a bit over the top.|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	yes|`|6jI9TGlzaa	yes im 14. i love wearing 4 inchers =] its perfectly norm. only for a party though or like shopping in new york.  any place else makes you look like your TRYING to be older.|`|1kSRPadaaa	yea high heels are fine for a 14 year old. but not too high|`|VR9iC2ykaa	yes|`|3FUrqYTTaa	its is fine for a 14 year old girl to wear high heels.<br>  As long as she only wears them at parties or events where<br>  you can wear heels without looking like you are trying to hard to be older.  if she doesn't present herself in a slutty way and can walk in them then go for it.|`|7942b81f62cbcca6b7e04fa3ab3ea3deaa	yes, it really doesn't matter how old you are it's just that it's so annoying when girls wear them and can't pull them off cuz they can't walk in them...|`|hl0fYeQyaa	Age doesn't matter.

Have your stylist use it as a highlight maybe just tone it a bit to get rid of the extra orange/yellow. Instead ask them to do low-lights in a dark blond or light brown color. That will give your hair the highlighted look without the heavy processing it will take to do highlights over that already bleached hair. So what you want to ask for is a Highlight Low-light with the highlights being the color you have just toned and the Low-light being a dark blond or light brown. As to the cut just get it trimmed lightly if you are trying to grow.|`|6vGj6r4taa	It looks disgusting. You should never bleach your hair at home. It couldve gotten in your eye or even worse.

kCdISEGqaa	A lot of artists refuse to do tribal anymore.  It's boring and old news.  I don't do tribal in my shop, and if a potential client doesn't like it, they are free to leave.

btpoLu5kaa	I had really long hair and cut it short over the summer, 2008, and it's taking forever to grow back out. Also, short hair is very boring compared with long, as you can't pull it up, braid it, curl it certain ways, make it look good wavy, etc. Bangs also annoy me (I got those over the summer, too). I wouldn't reccomend it. Try gradually taking off length, so you'll know how you function with shorter and shorter hair.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	try what selena gomez has now... but make sure they make your bangs even... don't let them make them crooked... <a href="http://www.juniorcelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/selena-gomez-charity-2-nc.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.juniorcelebs.com/wp-content/u...</a>|`|3w7VztEWaa	<a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2007/hair/070607_rihanna2_400X400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...</a>|`|EBaAaQDYaa	You should do a bob with front bangs, that's really cute.

AA10343852	Let your hair air dry and used a fat curling iron to add the waves. Or use fat curlers and use in sections all over hair while wet. Use hair dryer to dry or sleep on over night. When you take curlers out don't use a brush, just run fingers through hair and use a small amount of mousse at roots to add body to the front. As for makeup use a pressed powder compact in your shade all over face. Use a cream color eyeshadow on lids and a pencil liner in charcoal on lash line on top lid. Then use mascara in black on top and bottom lashes and a light pink color blush along cheekbones. Finally use a light pink lip gloss for lips. Good luck!!!|`|l6EO5pDDaa	let your hair airdry then take a curling iron and lightly curl the bottom for the mild waves. and for the makeup mascara and eyeliner on top only with a light blush on your cheekbones. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luckk.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	looks like its not about hair length, but,   style.  like the other person said...  curlers at bottom, moose throughout. hairdry, inside.... to get that poofed out look.<br>  <br>  makeup is minimal,, a base layer<br>  then eyeliner, <br>  as for eye shadow, light/pale from brow onto lids, then a slightly darker shade ON the lids.  mascara as well.

vCSQnIlRaa	Umm first I have to say there is no cartilage in the lips. Then I have to say don't play with it. That's just going to introduce bacteria into the piercing that you don't want. Try to be a little more careful not to bite it either. That really don't help the healing process but sometimes it happens. Now more then likely the piercing was done with a hollow needle. Hollow needles cut crescent shape holes not round ones. This little bump could be the skin kinda lying down making room for the round piece of jewelry and creating the little bump. Hmmm.... I hope you understand that. If that is the what's causing it over time the bump should go away. You should probably go talk to your piercer though just to make sure it's nothing bad.|`|ZAYubnrFaa	hmmmm i think it is totally normal. the same happened to mine and it was fine. im pretty sure it is he cartlidge in the lip, i guess its a shot when sumthing goes through your lip so i wouldnt b too worried. but if u are go see your piercer im sure they can give u advice.|`|lDRoOBczaa	1. stop playing with it!  that can irritate it terribly.<br>  2. it could be the bites, just like when u get bumps after a good cheek bite, but<br>  3.

HfA298Jvaa	Yes, drink lots of water, exercise, and eat healthy are all good combinations in preventing breakouts. My daily regimen of skin care consists of washing my face with dove soap, followed by the use of a core cleanser, and then I continue through with Proactiv Solutions products.  Also before bed I make sure to wash my face clear of make up and change your pillow cases weekly. Good luck!|`|0TCztPZBaa	by breakouts you mean "acne" i assume.<br>  You first have to understand why you break out. this is caused by the production of sebum which is oil that is produced from your sebaceous glands. Drinking water helps yes. Try taking a supplement  vitamin A which works wonders for the skin.  And remember excessive  washing and "drying out " only makes matters worse. I use a benzoyle  peroxide product 10% (lower dosage  for some  any where From 2%-10% for others) and a alphahydroxy acid as a conditioner to aleveate the dryness effect of the peroxide|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	wash your face with cold water thats works and drink lots of water make sure u wash your face atlease twice a day

If you want, you can always straighten bits on it, although that might dry it up and make it more poofy in the end.

So in cutting your hair she messed-up not by choice. It's probably not as bad as you think. When mis-haps happen to us personally. It is always "think worst first". But hey with  all that said I your new cut doesn't suit you just right, then try going even shorter BUT GET THE CUT FROM A GOOD PROFESIONAL......lol.

Do what they did.  Or, use mousse when you blow dry your hair and use your fingers to "ruffle" through your hair as you blow dry it.  Then when it is dry, use a bit of hair spray and "finger comb" your short locks into place.

PvQCD9Aaaa	your nose is more dangerous than your belly button, since your nose is cartilage and your belly button is just skin. <br>  <br>  just make sure you go to a safe, clean place and make sure you take good care of it until it heals.<br>  <br>  getting my belly button pierced was nothing, my nose hurt WAY worse. <br>  my nose was probably a 6, and my belly was about a 2.<br>  <br>  the only thing about belly button piercings, is that since it is just skin - it can migrate and eventually pop through your skin. just make sure you watch it, and it if starts moving - take it out.<br>  <br>  you have to clean it twice a day, with antibacterial soap and that's it. nothing else, no creams, no hydrogen peroxide, no alcohol...just antibacterial soap and if it gets infected - use a sea salt mix.|`|y2Uks58paa	its very safe, they use all the precautions that are required by law and give u the all the facts about aftercare. i had a friend that did it by herself once and it got all infected and nasty. the pros know what their doing tho.|`|m5N8Ur6Daa	Don't get it, belly button rings are so tacky!!!!|`|8oKazGVGaa	dont tell him just get it|`|HWmmVJ9faa	Getting your piercing done is totally safe. Just the aftercare is what you have to be concerned about. Use unscented, antibacterial soap 2-3 a day to clean it. And i just got mine pierced 5 days ago. It barley hurt. Probably a pain of 4. Honestly the next day hurt more then when i actually got it done. It was really sensitive and hurt when i barley bumped it.|`|9rSsisy8aa	well just tell him that they used a clean needle and that you can take it off when you sleep|`|hzcJH7ouaa	I wouldn't advise doing it behind your parents back, but if you look up online how to take care of it, and possibly some evidence of how safe it can be when properly taken care of and present it to your parents they are more likely to not mind to do it. Honesty is the best policy, and if you have some proof to back up your actions, your parents will be more understanding of the situation. As far as cleaning it if your parents allow it all you will have to do is talk to the person doing the piercing and they will let you know what to do , and of course the internet, you can find anything on it just by doing a search.|`|67bqVKHaaa	In tons of stores where they do piercings they have a new system. Your father is most likely worried about the diseases and viruses that could easily be spread through the old piercing systems. Tell him not to worry, because now they have a very sterile and safe way to go through with piercings. Each belly-button ring is packed individually COMPLETELY sterile meaning there is no bacteria. When you pick the ring you want, they open the brand-new package right before your eyes- so there are no worries through transmitting diseases since you technically get your own "piercer" and ring that has never been used before. It's just for you!<br>  <br>  So, this is what you tell your dad: "Dad, they have a new piercing system. Each belly-button ring is packed individually and is completely sterile and bacteria free! The package is only opened once- and that one time is before your eyes when you pick it out. Since its sterile and never been used, there is no risk of transmitting viruses, so it's completely safe!"<br>  <br>  Some stores that use this system are: Ardene's, Claire's, Icing.. etc.|`|2e36923da51c815eb4096942999c182baa	piercing is an UN-Natural act!

L3j2HrsJaa	I don't know if this is going to be the best for you, every skin is different, but I use Revlon Beyond Natural foundation when I just want a natural looking face and I love it. I apply a pea size allover my face evenly, just like a cream and than tap it, almost press it into my skin until I can't see any traces of white and it looks even. Then I apply a little, just a tiny bit more on my chin and forehead for a better coverage. You can use a concealer over it if you need to cover some blemishes. I let it dry for 2 min and then put some loose translucent powder to make sure it stays in place. <br>  I love it because it really works with and it looks like my own skin. Even when I look close up in the mirror, I can't see any foundation, only better, even looking complexion.<br>  However, if you need a stronger coverage, this might not work because it's very light. And be very careful what shade you use, if you choose a wrong one it will look orange or pasty pale.|`|BLArxeQGaa	Revlon Color Stay. They have TONS of shades so you're bound to find the one that is right for you. I'll send you links to a review of revlon versus MAC's foundation also I'll send you links to a tutorial on how to get flawless skin. It will show you how to get red of blemishes and dark circles and everything. I love this woman on YouTube she is amazing!<br>  <br>  MAC vs. Revlon<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u11exF8iEAA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u11exF8iE...</a><br>  <br>  Flawless face<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsBj_kLyQo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsBj_kLy...</a>|`|6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	First, you cover blemishes with concealer, just for extra coverage before you put on foundation. The best liquid foundation is Revlon's Colorstay. It's comparable to MAC's Studio Fix, but for less.<br>  To make sure that it stays, you should put on a pressed powder after you apply the foundation. <br>  If you would like to use another foundation, just remember to put on pressed powder after wards for it to be long-lasting and to prevent fall outs.<br>  <br>  From reviews, you should avoid Maybelline's Dream Mousse. Although, it really depends on skin type. Maybe it doesn't work well on somebody, but it might work well on you. Everything is all ambiguous, and you have to try it out to make sure it works.<br>  Good luck!|`|fnQM26BMaa	Cover Girl's original oil free foundation is the best.<br>  <br>  I've never used anything else.  Never given me a problem and never broken me out.  Stays on and all and I'm happy :)<br>  <br>  I hear good things about bare minerals too.  Lots of people say it's awesome.|`|RcBkUBsfaa	revlon color stay|`|lyp6JEcEaa	Being a professional Makeup Artist and skincare specialist of 10 years I can tell you I have learned quite a few things. Just because products are advertised as being worn by celebrities doesn't mean they really wear them and it doesn't make them good for your skin. I have used sooooo many brands Clinique, Mac, Estee lauder, Shishedo, Lancome, Mary Kay, Revlon, Loreal, Bare Escentuals etc etc.... Mainstream brands are NOT good for your skin now or in the long run. If you read the ingredient listing you will find nast pore clogging ingredients like...............<br>  <br>  Mineral Oil, petrolatum, (these two are a by- product from the petroleum/gasoline industry, they molecules are too large to penetrate the skin, so they sit on top of the skin and clog pores-Vaseline is included in this industry) <br>  <br>  Propelyne Glycol- a greasy like substance used as a lubricating agnet in cosmetics also used in break fluid<br>  <br>  Dimethicone/cyclomethicone- A synthetic silicone used as a humectant in cosmetics to keep moisture in the skin- it puts a film over the skin and will break you out (this is also in ALL face primers)<br>   <br>  Parabens- nasty chemical preservatives that have direct links to cancer<br>  <br>  These nasties are in almost all major cosmetic brands, people use these items daily and wonder why their skin looks terrible or why they break out when they never did before.<br>  <br>  What I suggest is going as natural/organic as possible. I have tried many many natural organic products as well including, Jason, Burts Bees, Dr haushka, Aubrey etc...I liked Burts Bees a lot but the best I have found and have been using on my clientele for over a year now is a company called Faerie Organic. Their mineral foundation is the best you canuse for your skin. They are light, airy, cover very well, look like your own natural skin only better, and they leave a gorgeous dewy spa like glow. They are the best makeup I have used on myself and my clients as they don't just conceal your blemishes with some thick greasy makeup, they actually can help heal acne while you wear them as they have a mineral Boron Nitride which is antibacterial and zinc oxide which is anti-inflammatory. Their ingredients are NATURAL unlike all the synthetic, greasy, ingredients in traditional makeup. You have to try them you will be shocked at the difference. They have a free sample kit at their site so you can even try them out first. I recommend them to everyone I know and I use them daily. Their site is <a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|te2G9pBkaa	Avon's "Smooth Minerals".

PXhhJim3aa	Interestingly enough, I came on here with intentions of asking if anyone's ever purchased a Coastal Scents palette before. I just ordered the Coastal Scents 88 palette from ebay about an hour ago and wanted to read some reviews.<br>  <br>  I read the feedback on my seller and all the buyers loved the palettes. They are shipped all the way from Tokyo and everyone loved the results.<br>  <br>  You should check it out.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	I love Coastal Scents. I've got several brushes from them and the 24 Shimmer Palette, and it's amazing and I would have easily paid double what I did for their products. The brushes are soft and very inexpensive. They don't shed and are comparable to MAC. The palette I got was $20 and all of the colors are very pigmented and long-lasting.|`|fcHN7Mrcaa	Yes, they work out great. You should try ELF cosmetics as well.|`|ceps7Udvaa	Actually , i was gonna do the same thing too. <br>  Come on here and ask the same .<br>  <br>  I heard it was really good . That or the PRO 120 full color palette on ebay.<br>  & besides .

I also get many compliments on my eyeshadow and I get asked what I'm wearing. Even from my teacher who is a professional makeup artist for about 20 years now. (I'm in training to become a makeup artist)<br>  DEFINATELY worth it.<br>  <br>  Theres also plenty of reviews on the pallettes on youtube.
yzIB8Cbiaa	Yes it will close. It will leave a scar, but it just depends on your skin and whatnot. My lip scars are only visible close up, but not really with my makeup on.|`|1Thb8v1yaa	yes it will close. <br>  <br>  uhm. the scar really depends on the person. <br>  my friend had 2 scars...not very noticeable..but they were there..<br>  <br>  and someone else i know just had like little dimples where the piercings were. so it all depends on you.

Umm, there r some pretty cool tatts here <a href="http://2face-tattoo.deviantart.com/gallery/#" rel="nofollow">http://2face-tattoo.deviantart.com/galle...</a> but you would need the design on paper, like, the original that they sent in to that artist (maybe you could send him a message if you see anything you like)<br>  <br>  Other than that , here are some random ones that you may like, but you'd need a really skilled artist to get the detail and shading and all that:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wya.deviantart.com/art/Zombie-38243215" rel="nofollow">http://wya.deviantart.com/art/Zombie-382...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://xythanon.deviantart.com/art/Zombie-92889023" rel="nofollow">http://xythanon.deviantart.com/art/Zombi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://maggotmaster.deviantart.com/art/zombie-33318848" rel="nofollow">http://maggotmaster.deviantart.com/art/z...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesserix.deviantart.com/art/zombie-68288392" rel="nofollow">http://jesserix.deviantart.com/art/zombi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://evillittleblue.deviantart.com/art/Zombie-hands-coverup-89040528" rel="nofollow">http://evillittleblue.deviantart.com/art...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://azgleff.deviantart.com/art/scary-96780604" rel="nofollow">http://azgleff.deviantart.com/art/scary-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://choffman36.deviantart.com/art/Alien-53582776" rel="nofollow">http://choffman36.deviantart.com/art/Ali...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://dark-nightshadow.deviantart.com/art/Alien-9319132" rel="nofollow">http://dark-nightshadow.deviantart.com/a...</a><br>  <br>  You can ask this guy to draw you a tattoo too, I think. <a href="http://opioid.deviantart.com/journal/18705771/" rel="nofollow">http://opioid.deviantart.com/journal/187...</a> his designs r pretty wikid, so you'd just described what you want to him and I'm sure he'd do a good job.

(i had dry eyes, and kept rubbing them, sooo many wrinkles came) So just watch what your small habits are and just try to cut back on it (like wrinkling your forehead that sort of thing) The best thing would be to moisturize a lottt and start buying those anti wrinkle creams, expensive, but they help. And think about it, if you start now, you'll have less later.

I cant say more.<br>  They are super pigmented and if you buy their 88 shadow palettes, they have the range of colours you'll have to spend hundreds of dollars to buy if you bought them separately.  <br>  Basically, whether you're a beginning, or a pro, these palettes will be worth the buck.  Worth for their quality and price.<br>  The shadow palettes have an original matte-ish palette and a ultra shimmer palette. <br>  Matte and ultra shimmer is just personal preference, and if you have the money, buy both.  both their formulations are great for all sorts of looks.<br>  Each of the shadows are about the size of a dime.<br>  Now a dime size may sound small, but you know those normal size eye shadows you buy, do you really ever finish using them?! , so yeah, technically, a dime size will last a long while.<br>  And theres so many colours to choose from, the whole palette will last like it never ends!<br>  I never thought 20-25$ could buy me that many colours in such great pigmentation. <br>  I have to give this palette 2 thumbs up. <br>  All the makeup gurus have one now a days. <br>  One word. Superduper.<br>  I would really recommend it.|`|zZbdjXBeaa	Yeah, I have the Ultra Shimmer 88 palette. It is of good quality and the colors are very pigmented.

7j9MfenOaa	Overwashing will bring the dandruff back, which is part of the reason your scalp has that odor.  I fight it all the time because my hair is so thick and course that hair products build up.  <br>  <br>  It sounds weird, but switch to Head and Shoulders for a while.  Also, try white vinegar.  Yes, it has a strong odor, but if you do it and let it set on your scalp for about five minutes and then rinse it, the smell of vinegar dissipates pretty quickly.  If you do this before bedtime, the of the vinegar should be gone by morning.  White vinegar has a natural odor killer, and isn't harsh on your scalp.  I use it twice a week during the summer to get rid of the smell of my scalp, which when mixed with sweat is really gross!  It makes the smell go away almost instantly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|WCsAl0cTaa	dry shampoo during the day and after a shower can work.

qxrr69bnaa	The ones with body blush do not tingle.  They make your skin look like you've been out in the sun--blushed, but not burned.   Some inexpensive ones that have body blush are "Love Monkey" and "Mind Eraser".  I've used them and got good results with them.  I'm partial to the silicone-based lotions.  I've been able to get some quality lotions at low prices on eBay.  Recently, my salon had some grab bags of samples and 2-for-1 specials, so I stocked up.|`|k90cErLLaa	Well since your pale you wont want to start out with the tingle factor kind or the hemp.

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|rB82Ujlgaa	Try coco butter, Shea butter , or Vaseline .

Or perhaps you can tightly braid your hair in about 1-2 inch braids when they are wet, and sleep in them, which will create more beachy waves. However, make sure that when doing either of these that your hair is pulled tight so that it is smooth, to minimize frizz.|`|56VRs1GFaa	start a good re-conditioning program NOW. Use hot oil every other time you wash, a deep conditioner once a week, get regular trims to cut off the damaged hair, and since thick frizzy hair tends to be dry, use a leave in conditioner after every wash. Don't use any more permenant products (perms, straightners, color) until your hair is healthy again.|`|lcriDvMKaa	hey first of all if your hair is damaged you should wash it only once every three days at the most so that your natural oils replenish your hair.When you do wash your hair you need a good conditioner like pantene.I have wavy hair and to make it curlier after a shower after conditioner i put mousse in and it gives it body it also takes away the frizziness.If you just want your hair wavy id recommend washing,conditioning and then putting a defrizz on your hair and putting it in a plait if its long enough.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|l5BrK3WCaa	Get a curler i guess

It does both well and also keeps lashes separated without clumping.  Its a bit more expensive though, compared to drugstore brands.<br>  <br>  Voluminous Mascara (with the curved brush) because of the same reasons as, but its a lot less expensive compared to the Lancome.<br>  <br>  Lancome Virtuous because it really separates the lashes very well and lengthens.  It doesnt thicken as much as the others, but it makes my lashes look long and pretty.<br>  <br>  Ive also used Max Factors 2000 Calories and Cover Girl Professional Mascara (the cheapest one out of these, and in a blue tube) with success.  The trick is to put on several coats, making sure your lashes dont clump too much along the way.  Dont take too long in between coats, either.  They sell this GREAT, fine toothed eyelash comb in Rite Aid and other drugstores, I believe, next to the fake eyelashes that is amazing.  It combs thru eyelashes so easily, and its only a few bucks.  Good luck!|`|BxMInUUNaa	I have tried so many different mascaras, looking for the perfect one. My defenite favourite is Diorshow it is really, really good. People ask if I have fake eyelashes.

CDpwCvmLaa	Hmmmm.. What length are they?<br>  You could change their style (without cutting) completely, but it depends on how they were cut. When you get out of the shower, try combing them down as a front-fringe, or brush them to the opposite side (so that the longer lengths that frame the sides of your face become the lengths that are actually on your face, covering the shorter hair in the process.) You could also go to a trusted hairdresser and ask them to section-off more hair, so you can cover your bangs up with longer lengths. This may or may not work depending on the kind of cut you've already got.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or, like somebody's already suggested, you can clip them back. Or tease them into a pouf.. Or go out and get yourself a bunch of kickarse headbands. I went through this really awkward stage not too long ago where all my hair got cut off (i have a strangely spherical face) and I know for a fact, it is possible to cover up until your hair grows out. :)|`|AA12004569	First off, breathe.

They have pencils, cream pods, liquid liners, and dark shadows that double as eyeliner.  I like using the eye shadow called charcoal and this black cream pod.  The other key to eyeliner is a short-bristled angled brush (MAC sells those too).|`|1qD3fPnMaa	MAC fluid line black track<br>  is the best one for me so far<br>  <br>  it doesn't smear and glides on smoothly <br>  its only about $14.00 <br>  its definitely worth it<br>  and its not a pencil, definitely water proof, you use a brush to apply it on but its not liquid...<br>  not sure how to explain but just go in mac and try it out! :]|`|cKugDkU2aa	the eyeliner that you twist the thingy up decreases in size if it is left in the sun.

dVJq7c8Vaa	The first thing I want to say is, it does not hurt at all.<br>  I got mine done about a year ago and I used titanium and it was fine but then I changed in 6 months later (thats how long you should wait, I know thats such a long time but w.e) to one from ardene, big mistake!  My bellybutton ring slowly got infected and I couldn't really tell. After about 2 months it really hurt so I took it out for about 3 months and then I put it back in ( your bellybutton hole can fill in with the infection in it so that was really stupid of me, but mine didn't close ) so it was still infected after all this time and just this week I went to a different shop and got titanium again and now my bellybutton is like 10 times better already.<br>  When/If you get yours done clean it no more than 3 times a day and dont over clean it.  You shouldn't use anything with alcohol.  If you have other piercings and you cant use the cheap stuff, you probably won't be able to on your belly button either.<br>  Make sure the shop is clean and they go through all the steps of cleaning WITH you.  They should give you a sheet for what you have to do.  I dont know where you live, but if you want to know where peircing shops are in your area go on Google Maps and type in "peircing shops in ___________" the blank is where ever you live and they will give you the number and street so yeah.<br>  P.S if you are chubbier stay away from bright colors for the ring.|`|APJZ8e18aa	i have mine done.<br>  i have for a while.<br>  <br>  I LOVE IT.<br>  <br>  i am a tad overweight though, so i dont show it.<br>  <br>  Heres the thing though, if you put a ring i thats not surgical steal or titanium, itll get infected. mine got infected and i popped the little bubble on the top an dnow i have permenant scarring from it. also, if you dont clean it out enough, it gets gross FAST.<br>  <br>  you have to make sure the person that does it is a legitimate piercer. you need to pierce it from the inside of the bellybutton out.|`|kAhXleGaaa	You go to the piercing place (clean and respectable, of course), ask for a navel piercing, sign the paperwork, pay for it, pick a ring or barbell, piercer marks your belly, you check to make sure its how you want it and that its straight, she/he clamps your belly button, you breathe in, and when you breathe out the needle goes through.. jewelry is inserted, you look in the mirror, tip your piercer, get aftercare information, and leave.<br>  <br>  <br>  mine was about 50 dollars (including 10 dollar tip)<br>  <br>  go to www.bmezine.com and look up some stories.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	When the piercer gets ready to pierce your belly they will first mark you belly with a marker to show where your piercong will be at. If you like where it at the will have you lay on a chair(like the ones at the doctor's). Then after she gets the stuff ready she will clamp your belly and the use a needle to pierce your belly. And then they will put the ring in.<br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt at all. I got mine done about 2 years ago.<br>  It cost me about $60.

JfZiLwzeaa	This is difficult for me because I'm "parent age" - but I understand the desire to pierce!  I like it - and I like hair coloring too!<br>  <br>  What do you do for a living? To earn money - or what are you going to WANT to be doing?  That should factor into this decision.  If you're going to be in a conservative field... move cautiously.  People are judgmental even if they try not to be.<br>  <br>  If you're wanting a more artistic field - you might be okay.  <br>  <br>  Also - you're 15-16... that is VERY young to be making these types of decisions, honestly.  Are you only wanting to do it because your parents disapprove?  Or is this an artistic outlet for you?  <br>  <br>  I would recommend somehow working out an agreement with your parents about the piercing... you do live in their home and their desires should be taken into consideration out of respect for them.  And the hole will close up... but the scar never goes away from it.<br>  <br>  Hair color is hair color... you can ALWAYS change it back!  I like the idea of your dark hair with chunks of purple peaking through... or maybe just entirely underneath.  But I would ask your parents if they can "deal" with that!  Blue tones fade fast to ugly greens... Reds turn funky pinks... pinks stay pretty cute on blondes...  <br>  <br>  Another thought - if your parents approve - if your hair is long - you could pull part of it back so that you could shave a small patch that would only show if you clipped that side back.  Then dye that "patch" a purple or blue - and have a pattern cut into it... like stars, butterflies, something like that!  I think THAT would be rockin - and as long as you keep your hair down... you'll just be a normal rockin hot girl!  Good Luck!|`|RqcLxDesaa	Nose ring or stud? A dainty little stud usually doesn't offend anyone. A woman that works with me takes hers out all the time and then has no problem getting it back in. Rings are more "offensive", but at your age, you can get away with it more easily. You will want to check policy about your age, you may be too young to do this without parental consent. Please go to a piercing studio. DO NOT let those idiots at the mall do your piercing.  Cartilage in your ear? Or Tragus? Surely not your septum! Cartilage is tricky, be careful.<br>  <br>  Dying your hair....if your hair is already black, it will be difficult to change the color without bleaching it first. Asians usually have such beautiful hair. I wouldn't do it, you're liable to ruin your hair. Try interesting accesories. Good luck!|`|Z7dShLRLaa	It does close up.|`|XYaPo7ZYaa	I have my nose pierced myself . I know if you want to get ur nose pierced professionally u will need your parents consent....At least in AZ. Second, You will have to keep something in it at all time during the healing process. (4-12 weeks) Or it can and probably will close and or get infected. Messing with it before its healed can also cause a keyloid. (google it, its gross) I know when i take mine out for even a few hours it tends to start closing very fast. If i were you i would wait till i was 18 and can do what i want or Wait till you have the parents ok.... If you really want it tell them you want a tattoo. Then when they say no explain how jewelry can be removed and a tattoo is permanent thats how i tricked my dad when i was 14. I told him either way i was gonna pick one and i got my bellybutton pierced.|`|rDUmQKniaa	hair color I would say go with A or D natural is always the best way to go. and I've had my nosed pierced since I was 12 and I never wear a nose ring because of my job and its still open I can push a ring through any time I want.
SSnoi6QPaa	It's a stupid thing to do, but I was thirteen not too long ago and peirced my own lip several times, so I know how you feel.  You're best bet would to boil a safety pin in water and then sterilize it with alcohol.  Also, put the alcohol around the area where you're going to peirce it.  Wash your face, too.  Then stick it through as fast as you can, it only hurts if you think about it.  But you HAVE to make sure everything is clean.  I did my lip the wrong way and it got infected and now I have a scar that looks like a permanent zit.  That way should work though.  And have the ring you're going to wear in your lip ready to be put through for when you take the safety pin out.|`|JujqGHXjaa	ew don't do it its a huge turn off for when u want a professional good paying job + ur way too young!|`|eqDCt6gQaa	im 13 now.<br>  <br>  dont do it yourself, please. theres too much risk<br>  <br>  i personally, for opinion, do not find them attractive (it might look like you have weird acne from a distance)<br>  <br>  find out why your parents dont want you to have it done. if they think youre not responsible, prove them wrong. it they think youll regret it, tell them that it weill be your own fault then.<br>  <br>  dont destroy the relationshipbetween your parents and you aunts and uncles|`|QHtfhc0Paa	piercings are awesome, but piercing yourself is not a good idea. i did it once. owch. its better to get  a professional to do it. they use the correct needles and are always sterile. if you do it yourself you're likely to get it infected and that would be horrible. also when you pierce yourself it takes you much longer because you always stop in between. you should probably wait because you are really young.|`|DEdtklecaa	Uh don't do it unless your parents agree. gosh thats pretty young. you'll probably regret it.
xs2mpYjWaa	After around 3 - 4 weeks they will be grown back to the normal length. I often over pluck mine and the grow back pretty quick.|`|VxbdjKIKaa	It really depends. Mine grow quickly. It might be a while for you though because you shaved yours. It will probably grow back quickly, but sadly thicker than they were before you shaved them. Until them just draw then in with a pencil liner.|`|aPMEiScnaa	In about a week some hairs will start to come back.  In the meantime, invest in a brow pencil, or a brow powder (it looks similar to eyeshadow).  You can draw them on until they grow back.  After about 2 weeks you should be able to let this whole thing blow over and forget about it.|`|105x2C3saa	my friend did that too!!! well she shaved a little bit of.. but it will grown back probably 2 weeks or less. depending how your hair grows|`|l5BrK3WCaa	um just let it grow by itself. or you can cut bangs and block them

If it's something you actually want and aren't just doing to try and fit in etc then I say go for it. <br>  <br>  But don't take my word for it the word on 2009 hair fashion is...<br>  <br>  Taking their cues from 2008, in 2009 women's hair trends will play to the extremes. They might be extremely short, extremely girly, extremely sexual or extremely slick. It'll only be the bob hair cut which will sit somewhere to the left of extreme; and you're going to be hard pressed to find that hair style on fashion forward women.<br>  <br>  Spring 2009 Hair Color Trends:<br>  <br>        * Peroxide Blonde <br>  <br>  When she wore a peroxide blonde, blunt-cut fringed hair style in 2007, hypermodel Kate Moss set two 2008 hair trends at once. And at the tail end of 2008, she may have done it again. In a photo shoot for Interview magazine, you'll find a peroxide blonde Kate Moss; one likely to make peroxide blonde a key hair color trend in 2009.<br>  <br>  FAMOUS TWO TONED HAIR:<br>  <br>  Jul 31, 2008 - Yesterday, back in Los Angeles, DJ Samantha Ronson showed off her new short crop haircut on a walk with Lindsay Lohan. Since the blonde has been cut off on the sides, her hair has a two-toned color. Samantha's had a double-dyed hue for some time now, but it's never been quite this pale or short.   (her hair looks like a skunk)<br>  <br>  Feb 10, 2008 -  While Beyonce's makeup looks lovely, tonight it's all about the hair. She has beautiful volume with big, wavy curls. But what's most surprising are the bold blonde highlights—you can't miss 'em!<br>  <br>  Jan 22, 2008 -  Over the weekend at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, Sandra Oh posed in the famous photo booth with newly black hair that has been highlighted with pale blond and caramel colors at the tips. I didn't realize she was so apt to take risks, since I've only known her to have solid black hair. Which hair color do you like best on Sandra?  <br>  <br>  Dec 10, 2007 -  Last night, Gina Gershon arrived to the Los Angeles premiere of her new movie, "P.S. I Love You" with two-toned hair. I can never get enough of Gina's gorgeous smile, but I'm not sure about her hair this time around.  Jul 10, 2007 -  Check out these two beautiful ladies who have made growing out your highlights look marginally acceptable. First there was Sarah Jessica Parker (this photo was taken from the SATC final episode) and more recently we saw Vanessa Paradis at the Chanel couture show in Paris . Whose two-toned hair do you like better?<br>  <br>  Meet socialite Daphne Guinness — yes, part of the family that produces Guinness stout. She's a London-based fashion journalist (not to mention an heiress to the beer fortune) who's known for her sense of style. She's often a blonde, but now she's brought some darkness into her hair. I think it looks chic and cool, but it's obviously not for everyone.<br>  <br>  Everyone's always talking about Britney, but little sister Jamie Lynn is quietly becoming a star in her own right. Still, as she joined other teenage stars at a recent Teen Vogue party, I was struck by how much she looks like Brit. Like her sister, Jamie Lynn plays around with her hair—just on a less drastic level.<br>  <br>  I also once did the white bangs on black hair and I liked it but it wasnt really for me.
hzcJH7ouaa	I use mineral powder foundation myself and i have never had a problem with dry and splotchy skin. I usually wash my face first, let it air dry, put on a light moisturizer let that dry and then apply the foundation and it works great for me and i tend to have dry skin. It also helps if you apply it correctly and as evenly as you can tapping your brush, applying in a circular motion.

JEdP02Oeaa	if you shave, here are a few at-home tips. always make sure your using a new sharp razor, dull ones with give you tons of nicks and cuts. before you shave, run your razor under steaming hot water. this will give you a closer, cleaner shave. make sure your using shaving cream or conditioner, as soap will make you itch. after you shave, put deodorant on the area you shaved. it sounds weird, but it actually helps prevent razor burns. mind you, hair will always itch when it grows back as it has to push through the skin, but these methods help shaving be a little less painful. hope i could help (:|`|mBVXgRLFaa	I usually just shave, it works best for me.

AA11338392	I aslo just started tanning. I have pretty fair skin & have burned a couple of times because I overdid it. Tanning is wonderful for preventing acne, FYI, so try not to cover your face. Be sure to wear your eye protectors though. Start out slowly, depending how intense the bed is (some are higher intensity than others) do only 5 minutes at a time until your skin gets used to it. I don't know how fair you are, but using a tanning bronzer helps get you a better tan and helps moisturize your skin. As for your face, if the rest of you burns, then so will your face. But if you go slow, your face will brown with the rest of you. There are products you can buy anywhere that sells tanning lotion/sunblock stuff, its made specially for faces. But you don't want to end up having a tanned body & white face! <br>  Another option is to cover your face, maybe half-way through, if you get worried. <br>  I hope this helps. <br>  Good Luck|`|gaQzqBb2aa	you can't ever avoid turning pink, sometimes your skin can be sensitive.<br>  you should apply it to your face, and moisturize it.<br>  but sometimes if you moisturize a burn, it could sting.<br>  the only way to PREVENT you from being sun-burned is to go in a light bed for a short amount of time, and then once you get browner and browner, go up another bed and so on.<br>  in the tanning salon, you can also by reallly nice tanning lotion, but it is a bit pricey, so i suggest just going to a drugstore and getting tanning/sunscreen lotion <br>  :)<br>  <br>  i hope your talking about tanning beds.. hahaha|`|8oKazGVGaa	tanning lotion costs 20$ or under from target and it should be fine to use on your face as long as you apply it sparingly like less than your body push it into your hairline too so you  dont get the mask effect.|`|m5N8Ur6Daa	When I used to tan, I started on the lowest level for about 5 minutes. <br>  I did that for a few weeks. I used tanning lotion that I bought from the salon (way expensive but smelled yummy.) Then I bought a new lotion and it smelled like cake so when I went in the bed it was like a hot oven full of cake..that was gross. <br>  Anyway, I digress<br>  I did the lowest level and worked my way up by adding time, then eventually going to the second bed.<br>  I got a super awesome tan. I was usually pink afterwards and then it went to a tan.<br>  I had to stop though because 1. I realized I liked having soft, pale skin and didn't want to get wrinkles and look like a Louis Vuitton bag 2. I started getting heat rash. I get it now whenever I take a hot shower or bath or I am in a hot room or out in the sun. I think this is directly related to my tanning.<br>  So, be careful! Go SLOW or you will get cooked and it is SO PAINFUL! And consider the fact that a lot of guys think girls who tan are gross. Just sayin..natural is beautiful!

I didn't accept my eyes until mid-way through High School and stopped fussing with the colored contacts.  I don't really wear make up, but when I do I use eyeliner which make them bigger and pop.  So experiment and have fun! I have light brown eyes and get compliments on them all the time.  You know brown eyes may not be what you waned, but you have to look at the brighter side of things.

My dad also has blue eyes and i wore gray colored contacts which against my brown looked pretty real considering they looked JUST like my dads. I got tired of worrying if ppl could tell they were fake so if they complimented or stared too hard i would tell them they were fake. I started playing up my eyes by making sure my eyebrows framed my face and eyes and by playing with make up that made my eyes pops. Purple and olive green shades make brown eyes look great. And as corny as it sounds a smile always makes everyones eyes look wonderful.  I am sure your eyes are beautiful and not boring at all.

Works for me :) I also use an unscented, light lotion down there after I shower.|`|DVET41lcaa	Umm well heres a few tips. Make sure u have a clean good razor. Dont use the cheap disposable ones either. Use a good well mositerized shaving cream and make sure u shave slow n soft...slow strokes. Dont shave all fast n stuff cuz it can irritate your skin .Let the shaving cream sit for a sec b4 shaving...so it can soothen the skin up b4 u shave. When u dry urself off..pat it dry instead of whiping off..so itll be more gentle to ur skin. I have bad skin on my face and sumtimes i get the ingrown stuff. hope I helped =]|`|CcEOxn4Maa	use a good quality SHARP razor. soak the hair in hot water first and cold water when youre done. then apply aftershave. it will burn a bit but it helps. i recomend a triple blade disposible with a lube strip.|`|GViTEsAEaa	How to Prevent: Ingrown Hairs<br>  <br>  Beneath your skin something could be occurring that could prove detrimental to reaching your goal of a healthy, blemish-free appearance. You may notice, not long after you shave, that small bumps may appear. These may become further irritated resulting in redness, itchiness, discoloration, or infection. What is known as pseudofolliculitis barbae but commonly referred to as “ingrown hairs” or “razor bumps” may be transpiring deep beneath where even your eyes cannot see. What are the causes of ingrown hairs? And is there anything one can do to effectively deal with this situation?<br>  <br>  Both men and women have reported this to be among one of the major concerns regarding how to take care of their skin's health especially after shaving. Ingrown Hairs, as the name implies, occur when the end of the hair shaft is cut resulting in a sharpened edge that as it grows, curls back into the same hair follicle and results in an inflammatory response (redness, itchiness, and/or raised infected area). At times the small “ingrown hair” hair itself can even be seen beneath the raised area. Thus the hair is “ingrown” in that it does not penetrate the dermis as it grows, as it should.<br>  <br>  Razor Bumps (caused by infected hair follicles) come from the end of the hair shaft that, after being shaved, is cut in such a way that again the end of the hair is sharpened and as it continues to grow it curls into another nearby hair follicle. This introduction of the sharpened end of a hair follicle into another causes an inflammatory response in the skin and leads to a pimple or bump because of the inflammation of the skin.<br>  <br>  The seriousness of the inflammation and infection of the ingrown hair or razor bump may vary. For some this is an annoying occurrence that doesn't pose a serious health problem. For others pseudofolliculitis barbae can develop into extreme Folliculitis when the hair follicle becomes acutely inflamed. Bacteria, yeasts, or fungi infections can further exacerbate the problem, and there are even acne variants of this same condition.<br>  <br>  Shaving 101<br>  <br>  For the majority of the cases however the suggestions that we can point to in this article first have to do with shaving itself. Those with naturally curly hair will have more of a propensity towards ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Many have found a decrease in occurrence when using an electric razor (electric razors are also available for women) due to the fact that although the shave may not be as close as that of a blade, the close cut resulting from the blade may be the cause of the end of the hair shaft becoming so sharpened and easily re-entering a hair follicle. Especially is this the case with double-track razors.<br>  <br>  Next: Washing the skin before shaving is helpful in exfoliating and lifting the hair away from the follicle while softening the hair and preparing it for the shave. Then shave in the direction of the hair growth (perhaps even every other day). Shave in the same direction each time. For ladies: on the leg area this means shaving down instead of up. Shaving in the same direction (and not against the grain) helps to train the hair to grow out straight, thus preventing it curling back into the skin. Afterward a damp warm towel can be applied for a few minutes to further soothe and soften.<br>  <br>  Ingrown Hairs? What to Do<br>  <br>  If ingrown hairs are still a problem after making sure that the shaving process was completed in such a way that more occurrences are prevented, then you must remove the plug of hardened proteins that are blocking the hair follicle with exfoliation products so that the hair may grow outward. Beta hydroxy acids (such as a salicylic acid) are best for this because they penetrate deeply into the plug of hardened proteins and slowly dissolve the plug. If the inflammation has progressed to the point of serious infection, then a dermatologist or physician will need to be consulted. Another option of course would be laser hair removal.<br>  <br>  Exfoliating every time you bathe and cleanse the face (as you would with Skin Biology's Exfol Serum or LacSal Serum, which contains beta hydroxy acid: salicylic acid) is your best defense against ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Gentle cleansing and keeping the skin smooth and supple works well to keep the hair follicles moisturized and growing in the right direction.|`|DBp0X6GCaa	ahh! i have THE SAME PROBLEM!<br>  <br>  i sometimes put sensitive skin lotion on after, it helps with the smoothness, but not the in-grown hairs :/
goIQpSfZaa	I got a tattoo on my hip just after turning 18. I'm almost 23 now. The tattoo is 4 inches long and 1 inch tall. It is about sixty percent teal- the rest blue and red shades. I got it done at a very reputable place. No difference or fading in five years. If you get sun exposure, rub a lot of SPF on it (and the rest of you, too!) It will look good for years if you get it done at a good place.

9AfYNwaDaa	get a really good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (i suggest a bigger conditioner bottle then shampoo) use that every day using a lot of conditioner and go get your hair trimmed (my hair gets dryer when i havent trimmed in a while)|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	If you iron your hair alot, that can cause it to dry out and make the ends split and break off, so it seems like your hair is never growing. This is my friends problem, but she refuses to stop ironing.<br>  If this is you, I suggest stop ironing your hair, and try to find another look for a couple of months, at least for your hair to grow. Or, not to iron it so much.<br>  Heres a link on tips to make your hair grow faster.<br>  <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Make_Your_Hair_Grow_Faster" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Make_Your_H...</a><br>  <br>  For the dry part, try buying shampoo and condition that says moisturize. Herbal Essences has Hello Hydration.<br>  Anything like that you can try.<br>  <br>  Myself, I iron too and my hair grows slow, and just started using a shampoo and conditioner call Mane n Tail. It was first used for horse hair, but they made a formula for humans, because they found it made the horses hair grow faster nd make it thicker. I researched it, and it's been proven. You can Google it if you like. Alot of postive results.<br>  So you can try that too. I started using it, so I cant tell you right now if it works or not. <br>  <br>  If anything, go to your stylist and explain the problem and see what they advise you.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you take vitamins and if you massage your scalp each day, that circulates the blood in the scalp and can help it grow.|`|nCqjP27zaa	Try a moisturizilng shampoo and conditoner... Also, if you use a flat iron or any kind of hot tools this may be the problem... My solution? Turn the heat down or dont use it as much...|`|eaMnHGNfaa	OMG!<br>  that happened to me too,<br>  try cutting your hair again so the dry ugly hair goes away and condition your hair everyday :)<br>  hope this helps...|`|KD1elF1Xaa	Try using olive oil on your hair!!!It makes it soo oily and shiny but it doesnt bring lice or bugs!!!<br>  :)|`|7N0hbw6Taa	maybe get a really good conditioner

There is not definitive way to know what size your feet MAY be sweetie. And, size 8 1/2 is the MOST COMMON women's shoe size. <br>  <br>  Oh, and on America's next top model, they all have long feet.

You can try using straightening products along with your normal straightener, or try revlons ceramic plated one. It worked ok. If you want a really great straightener, that flattens your hair out and makes it look great, save up about $120 and buy a Chi, made by Faroux, you can usually find in salons. Then along with that use a product like Redkens Heat Glide to protect your hair. Super smooth, beautiful straight hair. Good luck.|`|8a7511b284d7e3b05f7d7bdc18ff1fa9aa	remington wet-2-straight. my friend has it and says its awesome. the wet part can act like a steam on a clothing iron; its conditioned and gives moisture to dry hair. i think there's a ceramic version too. check. you can get it at target or walmartfor $30. hope you find it in stock!

noBjJglGaa	If you take a fish oil supplement it does help with your hydration with your skin and hair.|`|iLuc1xyAaa	Try putting johnson baby oil in your bath. It hydrates your skin very well and all you have to do is pat yourself dry when coming out of the bath. Be careful not to fall though, the bath might be slippery.<br>  Also take skin tablets, you may notice at first your skin may break out but it must get rid of the toxins in the body to clear the skin.

I`ve tried it.|`|LF9F5z9Raa	what do you mean, see what it looks like? it looks like you have excellent concealer on. put on your foundation. OK- so you look like you have foundation on. good. put on the mineral veil and it looks like you have been air brushed for pictures. it refines the look of pores and makes sure your foundation look finished. it will turn out the same color as your foundation.

After you get a better feel for what you like then you add more or less. An Idea of a cute girly punk fit to ME would be; the 80's tampered jeans they sale at Express now (there really tight and straight down noT bell bottoms) in maybe a dusty gray or blueish gray, With sum pink pumps, a pink bra and a white wife beater that is a LITTLE see thru not majorly but the norrmal, then Id add a skull head necklas, matching hoops, A funky leapord print bracelett, a cute purse thats not over the top but has something cute and funky to it. From there Id either wear my hair down and pin up some pieces on the top or a cute pny tail with sum pieces everywhere.<br>  <br>  <br>  Everything you need you dont need a 'punk' store! just use your imagination and be creative, it makes the outfit more fun to wear and no other girls can copy you. You can get accessorys anywhere, funky jeans anywhere, crazy t shirt anywhere and right now Ive seen allot of skull head ish out right now, <br>  <br>  hope this helpedm -lol|`|f64da0c2c0c667cb9df4b112be4c14b8aa	Try colors like black and pink.

Most women's jeans arent' sized that way, so perhaps they are a pair of men's jeans? I wear that size men's jeans, in an equivalent for women's I would suggest a size 6 or 8. I like men's jeans better, though, so perhaps you should check out more of her jeans to see what type and brand they are to get ideas of what to buy, since different brands are going to vary slightly in their sizing. Good luck!|`|oIbjUaIZaa	i'd say a size 7 long.|`|2BW0EweAaa	lets see I'm a 26 and thats size 3 so a 29 is like a size 9 or 10.  the 32 is length|`|YQZLl7bYaa	it means waist size 29 inches, leg length 32 inches.

bOGN0ZWeaa	OHHH I have to say that ADRIEL has a good Idea... or have a friend go there to go shopping..

They judge you by what you are wearing and its part of getting the job (kind of sad but true). Just wear something that looks like something from Urban. If you look like you don't have the style that matches the clothes in the store, they won't hire you.|`|00hrUiQZaa	uh yh that mite look good...but not too casual.You could wear something wiv urban outfitters label on? xx
eMX7eDgbaa	Hmmmm...well since ur avatar is a blond I would straighten your hair and make sure that your not constantly checking it or combing it out with your fingers that night. dont be afraid to get your hair messed up, as long as your hair is nice when you arrive. Well depending on the weather. For clod weather: skinny jeans or a skirt w/ leggings (idk if its inn were u live) and a tank top with cute matching sweater or just a nice long sleeve tee. FOR WaRm wEATHER: wear short shorts with a tank top (bring a seater just incase) or  skinny jeans with a logo tee. with your make up I would go for a more natural look, so skin tone colors, no blush (if u put some make sure it blends) also try mixing skin tone colors to make the color just a slight bit darker/tanner than your natural skin tone so that you POP OUT. put some lig gloss on and carry it with you through out the night. also here is an extra, try to wear like a long necklace or just a  couple of bracelts, not both!!!! and try to wear flats or converse as shoes.  Good luck- MAKE HIM jEALOUS of what he cAnT HaVE!!!! hhehehe Go 4 it :)|`|sg0m6LBRaa	yeah be very confident.<br>  uhm wear makeup, wear your hair down, and dress rly pretty|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Depending on your hair length here is a beautiful suggestion, but maybe you don't have to wear the flower.

WqdmDiQaaa	Use light or bright coloured eyeshadow, you can also use some that have some sparkle to them, keep away from dark on your lids, as it will make them appear smaller, you can still get the scenester look using bight colours, you can use a darker colour on the lower lashline as you would eyeliner, covergirl makes some awesome brights.

A85NTGBVaa	If you wake up in the morning and your hair is exactly the same as it was when you went to bed, you have fine hair. If it's a little messy, but salvageable without ten gallons of water, it's normal, if it's pretty messy, but will look great once styled, it's thick, and if it's a total disaster, it's coarse.|`|9zLiOor9aa	fine is like really sleek and soft normal is just regualer hair|`|Qxph0O5Raa	It might be somewhere in between.  Fine hair tends to slip out of ponytail holders and doesn't hold volume well (like if you blow dry with a a big round brush and your hair looks great for an hour but falls flat pretty quickly.)|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	If you put it in a pony tail and it flops around when you walk fast then it's fine.

qQqC2cHIaa	Legitimate sites that sell fakes?  That's a contradiction!  Fakes are not legitimate, so you are asking the impossible. To be perfectly honest, the best places for designer labels for less money are the three stores that you dismiss, especially TJ maxx.  Since many expensive stores are closing or not taking full orders places like TJ maxx have better inventories than in the past.  These three stores are also having their end of season clearances and there are some real big bargains in the stores.<br>  <br>  Also H&M sells pieces that are knock offs of all the big designer looks, they make the same silhouettes and styles in cheaper fabrics.  H&M is the thrifty fashionista's best friend.<br>  <br>  When if comes to buying fakes, be a careful consumer.  In their search to buy designer names for cheap prices they end up being ripped off by off-shore companies that show pictures of authentic merchandise but ship cheap plastic fakes and then charge more for shipping that for the original merchandise. Some people never receive what they pay for and some are very disappointed by what they receive. returns are difficult, if not impossible, in spite of what the site says.|`|DEMQR8piaa	try udresses.com- they've got lacoste and juicy Couture?|`|5JumtCTGaa	<a href="http://www.ebay.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebay.com.au/</a>|`|yqNMzGQhaa	Try ebay or search google.|`|d15523b6f2eb977e0485a8956eed4c73aa	www.ebay.com|`|J8tYQZ4gaa	ebay for sure or try your local swamp meets!|`|7942b81f62cbcca6b7e04fa3ab3ea3deaa	go to www.bluefly.com <br>  i love it, its amazing. and try lohemanns and off5th avenue, and nordstrom rack. if you go to designer web sites or some department store ones (Bloomingdale's, saks, and neiman marcus) and look at their sale items that might work too.

HMzsm50vaa	If I were you I would start off 15 to 30 minutes a day increasing five minutes every two weeks and don't go more than an hour to an hour and a half especially if you go everyday.  I'm 33 and spent waaaaaayy too much time in the sun and am already showing signs of small sun spots on my hands, legs and face.  But sun is actually good for you as long as you don't over do it.  Of course you can't avoid going out and having a good time spending the day at the beach, park, etc, but that's when you should but on a sunblock, and reapply.  Even when you are tannning you should put an spf of some kind to avoid the bad stuff.  I know how you feel though....I believe everybody looks so good with some kind of color lol.  Just an FYI I'm blonde, blue eyes, freckles, and tan pretty easily, but in the beginning if I don't protect myself, I will burn.  For example, the beginning of my son's baseball games I can get a slight burn even with protection, but towards the end, I've built it up and don't burn.  Does that make sense?|`|6kVgsUveaa	You should spend ALL day in the sun if you can.<br>  You won't burn if you maintain hydration & moisturisation of the skin.<br>  Ease into your tan gently by exposing yourself for an hour, then gradually increase this as often as you can to 1.5 then 2 hours, 2.5 etc etc.  All the while, you must ensure you keep the skin supple/soft with screen/block/oils/creams & more importantly, cooled (take a dip in the pool/ocean/shower for 5 minutes. Gradual tanning will ensure lasting colour.|`|HNycdO3Raa	1-2 hours|`|EIzs2OWeaa	Not more than 15 minutes if you value your skin.

Personally I like LV because it NEVER goes on sale.  I hate to spend $1500 on a handbag just to see it marked down to $700 5 months later.  I do however think that Coach is great for younger women, or women who don't believe in spending too much on handbags.

2inq4zHZaa	Well, I can't speak for all artists, so please don't take my answer to generalize tattoo artists.  But, I was very good friends with a tattoo artist/piercer, who actually did have a preference when it came to who he was working on.  His portfolio wasn't set up like the one you are describing, but I was in his shop quite a bit and witnessed the work done on larger girls vs thinner ones.  It was like his work on people he didn't find attractive was completely half-hearted, and work on girls he found attractive was immaculate.  Quite a difference.  I didn't see every single client that came through the door obviously, but from what I saw, it definitely mattered to him.  He even said he hated working on people he didn't think were attractive.  He described it as "gross".  I thought it was really messed up.  In fact, I never had anything done by him again after he told me how he felt.  I am figuring that he probably put so much effort into the "hot" girls to try to lure them back in hopes of hooking up with them.  It's wrong to be like that as a tattoo artist.  Again, I am not saying this is common, or happens with every artist, as I do know a few that are great artists, who do equally good art on large people, thin people, men, women, all races, with no prejudice.  I just thought I would let you know that it does happen.  So this may be happening to you.  I wouldn't know how to find out though.  That would be a little tough without just flat out asking.  Maybe you should just look into finding a new artist.  I think your problem sounds legit enough to look into for sure.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	I've never heard the likes of it, a client is a client and when you do a job  like tattooing or body piercing you do your best at what the client wants weather it is to your liking or not. If this guy has tattooed you and you are not happy with it regardless of the reason I would certainly let him know you are not happy, your paying for something and if you don't get what you want you have a right to complain.<br>  <br>  I'd look elsewhere for future work, the vibe from this guy sounds off.|`|dYK1KPp4aa	I think the key here is to become comfortable with a tattoo artist before he or she even begins to touch your skin. Why would you leave a permanent mark on your body up to a complete stranger? <br>  <br>  I'm not saying you made a bad decision, but keep an eye out for another tattoo artist that you may "click" better with. Good luck!|`|d9B4EVFxaa	seems like it could be legit...but I have never heard of tattooists slacking on their quality because of this now price on the other hand I've deff. heard of and actually experienced first hand....the guy I have gone to for my tattoos has never charged me over 60 bucks for a tattoo but I am "pretty" (not trying to say anyone else isn't just saying stereotypically because I am 5'5" 113lbs blonde) anyhow my friend who is bigger had gotten her tattoos done by him and was charge a good bit more...my tattoos are bigger and more detailed than hers...for both of her she spent a total of an hour and a half being tattooed and for the 3 he did for me it took a good 3 1/2 hours....<br>  <br>  sorry if you do find that is what the issue is and i wish you the best of luck finding an artist that's not into looks of the person to decide the quality of his/her work!!|`|0fofwDG5aa	I like to think that your first reaction is the right one(WOMAN'S INTUITION)!!!!! If u feel his work is slighted with u(u r probably right)....go somewhere else....I would!!! Tattoos r long term & u don't want to have regrets about them.  There r a lot of tattoo artist out there who don't care about body size....they care about their quality of work...as it should be!!!!!!!|`|mzLMkdbQaa	I don't have much experience with a situation like that..not like I'm saying I'm the "hot girl" with no tattoo problems or anything, I've just never seen or heard of it like you've described, my main artist has been completely thorough with all of his clients it seems from his portfolio including myself.  I just want to say that sounds really messed up if that's the case, if this tattoo artist is favoring people over people, but it's definitely believable. It shouldn't matter what weight, race, gender or age when it comes to tattoos like "Sick of it All" said, and I don't believe you should have an ultimate "connection" with your tattoo artist, like it's your fault for his favoritism, like a user above me said. Tattoos are beautiful and of all people tattoo artists recognize this and admire it, or should atleast, it's their career and way of life, so really that makes them less of an artist altogether if they are favoring people like I said. So you have every right to question and I completely acknowledge your concern/sensitivity and I hope you start atleast searching for a new artist. Goodluck :-)|`|oU2UnPSuaa	I think your tattoo artist is a total jerk.  I am a big girl (5'7'' 225) and I have 4 tattoos done by 3 artists and have also experienced an artist like you described. When I got my first tattoo at 18 the artist didn't seem too pleased to be tattooing me.  My friend and I went in to get stars done and my artist charged me almost as much for the one star on my upper back as my friend's artist charged her for the TWO stars (the same size as mine) on the backs of her legs.  He rushed through mine so bad that when I got home I realized he missed all sorts of spots.  A few months later I went to another artist to get my lower back done. This artist charged me a much fairer rate and didn't seem to mind in the slightest that he was tattooing a big girl.   After not getting any tattoos for almost 8 years I decided I wanted some more.  I decided to look around for a new artist because I no longer knew where to find the other one. I tried a few shops where the guys didn't even want to help me when I came in the door. I started to get discouraged but I went into one shop and was approached almost instantly by a very friendly artist who answered my questions and concerns and didn't make me feel stupid or uncomfortable.  I decided that he was the artist I wanted to try and I couldn't be happier with him!  He is willing to tattoo me anywhere I want, never makes the fact that I am a big girl an issue, and charges me VERY fairly.  He tattooed my foot for me and I was so happy with his work and prices that I went back less than a month later for my next tattoo.  I think you really need to look around and check out some shops before your next tattoo.  If you happen to be around the Orange County, California area I can recommend a wonderful artist for you.  If not I wish you the best of luck in your search!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Oh bless you. I really hope that's not the reason. I have never heard of an artist with this attitude but I don't doubt there are some idiots out there. They shouldn't ever have been given the honour of being able to use a tattoo machine. A friend of mine who is a large guy was being tattooed at the same time as me last week (coincidence, we didn't go together) and after while he was there the other artist actually said he loved having a bigger canvas to work with and took the piss out of my skinny arms joking that I could get a sleeve for a tenner because there was no room to fit anything good on them! So no such hostility there! And this is the case with most places, so I would really rethink your artist next time. My only other thought, when I read this, is that if you mean you've seen his other work in his portfolio, then it could be simply that he's picked out the best of his work for that and left out the day-to-day mediocre stuff, and that a lot of people are receiving second rate tattoos, not just you. But I really don't know. I'd really look into going elsewhere in the future though. Whatever the reason behind it, there's no reason you should be paying good money to be receiving work of a low standard. Good luck finding someone better!|`|kCdISEGqaa	Sounds like complete trash to me.  He shouldn't be tattooing if that's his attitude.  Your tattoos are his reputation, and if he does sh***y tattoos on you, then his reputation is at stake.  I have never met an artist in my years, that would risk it by tattooing someone poorly based on what they look like.  If I were you, I would go elsewhere, but, my concern is, if you are not happy with your tattoos, and you now he could have done better, I would go back and have him fix them up for you.  I don't include faces in my portfolio, I only include the tattoo.  I am a woman artist and this really offends me.  Sounds like he gets his rocks off while tattooing.  Does he guarantee his work?  If so, go back, and have him fix it.  If he won't do it, he's scum.  Sorry, but you were taken advantage of, he wanted his money and didn't care about the quality of your tattoos.  Can you post pictures?  Are you in Ohio?
DfDss68haa	Hey, congratulations! I just went natural too after transitioning for 10 months. I have a lot of tips. I highly recommend <a href="http://nappturality.com" rel="nofollow">http://nappturality.com</a> and <a href="http://curlynikki.com." rel="nofollow">http://curlynikki.com.</a> Great sites.<br>  NATURAL HAIR AND LIFE:<br>  <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2008/12/18/nappily-ever-after-not-quite/" rel="nofollow">http://www.racialicious.com/2008/12/18/n...</a><br>  <br>  HOW TO TRANSITION:<br>  1. Leave hair out while transitioning<br>  PRO: Learn to deal with new texture right away and what works and doesn't. Can grow out natural hair and keep relaxed hair so you don't have to have short hair. You don't get the culture shock of braiding down. Can cut off hair in little chops if you want or keep it until ready for the BC. <br>  CON: The hassle of dealing with both textures can lead to a premature BIG CHOP. Also if you aren't ready for short hair not good for you because breakage might occur since the meeting point of relaxed/natural is fragile. Hard to find styles for both textures. <br>  <br>  2. Braid hair down/put under weave.<br>  PRO: This is good if you don't want to deal with the hassle of two textures and want to keep relaxed hair as long as possible. Also can wear kinky textured weave so you know what you would look like with natural hair and how to treat it. <br>  CON: Some culture shock when hair gets unbraided and you don't know how to deal with new growth if you wore a straight weave. Braiding down for too long can also cause breakage and thinning around the temples. Plus as you said, it prevents you from doing treatments.<br>  <br>  3. The BIG CHOP <br>  PRO: Easiest, cutting off hair right away means no hassle of two textures and right option for people who's relaxed hair is damaged or they just want it gone right away. Also you get to know your natural self from the beginning.<br>  CON: leaves you with about 1" of new growth. Not for you if you hate short hair.<br>  If you choose to leave hair out here are my tips on styling and hairstyles:<br>  <br>  HAIRSTYLES:<br>  1. Straighten the new growth to match the relaxed hair<br>  2. I personally prefer to match the relaxed hair to the new growth. It's healthier, the styles last longer, you can do it yourself and it teaches you how to deal with your own texture right away. <br>  I like youtube.com. Some great natural users for product and styling tips <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/itsmsheathernicole" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/itsmsheather...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/curlychonicles" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/curlychonicl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rusticbeauty" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/rusticbeauty</a><br>  <br>  5 THINGS you MUST know about natural hair and for during the transition.<br>  1. Never, never, NEVER try to detangle or comb it without some type of conditioner in your hair. You are just asking for breakage and pain. Only detangle with fingers/wide tooth comb. It was rough until I discovered that conditioner is your best friend.<br>  <br>  2. You may have a very kinky/nappy texture. Do not look at curly haired pictures and think your hair will look like that. Do not think your hair will grow downwards or shine or sway. Embrace the texture you have or you will be running back to relaxers. Transition your mind, not just your hair.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8_mzdBr97g&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8_mzdBr9...</a><br>  <br>  3. Hair grows kind of slow for some people and it can get discouraging. Document your progress. This is important becuase it's easy to ignore how much your hair has grown. Get a camera.<br>  <br>  4. Go to the below websites, check out people at the forums, how to videos on youtube, look at people's fotkis, really research becuase there is now so much more info on natural hair than there used to be. Also know everyone's hair is different so find what works for you. Experiment and find a good nappy support group. <br>  <br>  5. You may get negative reactions from people like dirty looks and mean comments. Some people are still negative about nappy hair and some people just don't like change. Just hang in there becuase you know your hair is healthier. This will probably be the most difficult step for you and honestly you may be your worst critic. <br>  <br>  INSPIRATION FOR BAD HAIR DAYS:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/naturalnana" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/naturalnana</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://public.fotki.com/poochie247/pretty-brown-thangs/the-urban-hair-suite/" rel="nofollow">http://public.fotki.com/poochie247/prett...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://hairspiration.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hairspiration.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Goodluck ?

eXDYvvuxaa	L'Oreal paris is generally a good, It should lighten it sufficiently, because you are you using it on your roots it should bleach fast because "virgin hair" allways bleaches very quickly.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt recomend using a toner dye strait after this might be a little much for your hair, Instead I suggest using redken pearglam treatment, this is not like a conditioning treatment, but is like a temporary toner that should last a week or so until your hair feels healthy enough to dye it again.

How tall are you? Most models are freaking tall!<br>  <br>  See if you can set up a photo shoot, ask your parents, save up some money (most photo shoots are quite pricey. I charge per print $20 bucks and I'm extremely cheap!) Practice poses and faces in the mirror.<br>  <br>  Only the lens can tell.<br>  <br>  I have a model that I use often, and looking at her you wouldn't be able to tell that she's so great behind the lens because she has sort of an awkward facial structure and just looking at her you wouldn't call her "attractive" or "sexy" but when she gets in front of my camera she completely changes and uses those awkward angles to her advantage and the photos come out as gold and beautiful. <br>  <br>  I would definitely prescribe some America's Next Top Model to you, just ignore all of the drama and pay attention to what the professionals say on there.|`|ukHLartkaa	I think you are very pretty, one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen.

2oN7WrVKaa	Yeah, thats how I do my hair.<br>  Except Dark brown under the bangs, and on the sides, and blonde over-all.<br>  They will first put in the bleach, and then put the dye in right after, and wash it all out the exact same time.<br>  I would do it professional.<br>  Its REALLY easy to mess up!
kUZIWRfZaa	Use Pantene Pro V Conditioner. Leave it in your hair after you've washed it, let it air dry. It works just like gel only no harmful ingredients and it will protect your hair, keep it shiny, and everyone that walks by you will tell you your hair smells FANTASTIC...<br>  <br>  This is my hair with only Pantene Pro V in it.<br>  <a href="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/MissHelmz/lynncurls5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/M...</a><br>  <br>  Whether your hair is curly curly like mine, curly, or just wavy/curly, Pantene works perfectly!
eXDYvvuxaa	My hair is naturally afro curly and coarse, I found that my main problem was not in using anti-frizz or coarse hair shampoos. But that the problem was in the moisture levels in my hair, so Im now using Wella Hydro shampoo, DeLorenzo (australian brand made of natural australian plant extracts (Just a VERY good conditioner to sum up)) Intensive moisture conditioner aswell as wella hydromask. <br>  <br>  Your straitening could be the troubles of your coarse hair, generally being that damaged hair is coarse. What you are needing to do is make sure you are using a ceramic straightener (not just any old one but one of reputable brand), I suggest a ghd, chi or remington if price is an issue. But allso your need to remember to preotect your hair from the heat, Ghd, L'Oreal pari and redkin all make exceptionally good protectants.<br>  <br>  Lastly do not get it permanantly straitened this will wreck havic on your hair especially because of its current condition.<br>  <br>  Your best bet will to be to consult your hairstylist on the appropriate hair care regime for youu.<br>  <br>  I cant answer the second part of your question cause my computers being weird and wont open your links sorrry :(
Vka09geaaa	i have the same type of hair!!! i cant see the pic tho i just straighten mine in the night then let it go wavey ;) x
Eo4tyL0kaa	liquid works better on the upper lid to get a clean line, but the same look can still be achieved with pencil eyeliner as well. <br>  <br>  draw a line as close as possible to your lash line starting from the inner corner of your eye going outwards to the edge. <br>  <br>  use your pinky finger or a smudger to smudge the line so it covers the desired areas, leaving no skin space. <br>  <br>  then do the same again except this time you do not need to smudge, and as you get to the edge, start curving the line upwards to get the cat eye effect.<br>  <br>  hope this helps (:|`|iFAUHTDgaa	Ok first of all, don't use a pencil eyeliner. Use liquid eyeliner. start in the middle going towards the end so that you can be able to tell how its going to look. then finish the inner part.

Personally I use the mac fluidline with a hard angle brush and it's amazing! :)<br>  <br>  When putting it on make sure you don't pull your eye! Otherwise it will go all crinkly and weird when you let go :P so just close your eye and put it on in short strokes not a big long line :)<br>  YouTube have lots of tutorials too! <br>  Also if your looking for thick lashes have you ever considered false lashes? There amazing! :D<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! ;)

8Su7fT8daa	Make sure you get layers cut into your hair if you are going to have in longer. The longer your hair is the more it weighs down your curls so having layers allows you hair to curl and be more springy. <br>  <br>  Also, curly hair has to be cut differently than straight hair. Not only are they different textures, the actual shape of the hair shaft is different. Straight hair has round hair shafts, whereas curly and wavy hair has an oval shaped shaft. Make sure whoever is cutting your hair know how to work with curly hair.|`|9KdLANdSaa	try a simple haircut w/bangs and straighten the bangs every day...to make them look good and you can decide if you want to straighten the rest or just leave the rest curly.<br>  :)<br>  it will look good.<br>  layers look good too|`|6tlw6Cq5aa	Let it grow, the best thing for curly hair is for it to be long.

QtBdOWYTaa	One thing to keep in mind is that the faster you lose weight when you stop "maintaining" the faster you will put it right back on again...<br>  <br>  Eat enough calories but not too many. Maintain a balance between your calorie intake and calorie expenditure—that is, don't eat more food than your body uses. The average recommended daily allowance is 2,000 calories, but this depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity.<br>  <br>  Eat a wide variety of foods. Healthy eating is an opportunity to expand your range of choices by trying foods—especially vegetables, whole grains, or fruits—that you don't normally eat.<br>  <br>  Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes—foods high in complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, low in fat, and free of cholesterol.<br>  <br>  Drink more water. Our bodies are about 75% water. It is a vital part of a healthy diet. Water helps flush our systems, especially the kidneys and bladder, of waste products and toxins.<br>  <br>  Limit sugary foods, salt, and refined-grain products.   Sugar is added to a vast array of foods. In a year, just one daily 12-ounce can of soda (160 calories) can increase your weight by 16 pounds. <br>  <br>  Don’t be the food police. You can enjoy your favorite sweets and fried foods in moderation, as long as they are an occasional part of your overall healthy diet. Food is a great source of pleasure, and pleasure is good for the heart – even if those French fries aren’t!<br>  <br>  Get moving. A healthy diet improves your energy and feelings of well-being while reducing your risk of many diseases. Adding regular physical activity and exercise will make any healthy eating plan work even better. Start with a walk if nothing else. Don't try to do more than your body can handle.<br>  <br>  Take time to chew your food. Avoid stress and TV while eating. Listen to your body: Ask yourself if you are really hungry. You may really be thirsty, so try drinking a glass of water first. During a meal, stop eating before you feel full. It actually takes a few minutes for your brain to tell your body that it has had enough food, so eat slowly. Eating just enough to satisfy your hunger will help you remain alert, relaxed and feeling your best, rather than stuffing yourself into a “food coma”!  Eat early, eat often: Starting your day with a healthy breakfast can jumpstart your metabolism, and eating the majority of your daily caloric allotment early in the day gives your body time to work those calories off. Also, eating small, healthy meals throughout the day, rather than the standard three large meals, can help keep your metabolism going and ward off snack attacks.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	For starters, get a copy of a picture of a food pyramid. It helps a lot, really. It shows how many servings of each type of food to eat, such as grains and poultry. Try not to drink artificial juice so much and stick to water. Load up on fruits and vegetables. Remember not to starve yourself or stick your finger down your throat; it's unhealthy and does not help your weight. It doesn't matter how much you technically eat, it depends mainly on WHAT you eat. Good luck.|`|HLmd17r9aa	Find out your daily caloric needs based on your weight, height and gender. You can do so at this website: <a href="http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie...</a><br>  <br>  Once you find that out, it will give you something that tells you how many calories you should eat per day for "Fat Loss" and "Extreme Fat Loss". You can eat more if you plan on exercising as well.<br>  <br>  3500 calories equal one pound of fat. So cutting 500 calories a day and exercising to burn 500 will have you losing 2-3 pounds per week. That will give you plenty of time to reach your target by April.<br>  <br>  PS - Do NOT cut down to less than 1200 calories or your body will start burning muscle and not fat.|`|N1z3ArcTaa	ok it is possible. First of all try to feel comfortable with yourself all the time, no matter what your weight is.<br>  Eat small meals every often. Try to have 5 meals per day (balanced and small of course) that will fasten your metabolism. Avoid fast food and food high in calories such as chocolate, cookies, ice cream and those delicious desserts that you already know. Of course try to exercise regularly! If you jog, try to do it in stages, first run fast for 3 or 2 minutes, then walk for about 7 minutes, then jog for 10 minutes and repeat these changes. It also accelerates your metabolism.|`|ec800966099e02a9090fd20472ae5565aa	1. Is it possible? yes... is it healthy is another question<br>  2. What do i have to do? cut your diet a whole lot and exercise a ton<br>  3. What kinds of foods should i eat? whatever you want as long as it doesn't go over your allotted calories for the day.<br>  <br>  basically you have 34 days.... go for 20 it will be easier and healthier (next year start earlier!). basically you need to lose half a pound every day, or about 4lbs every week. a pound equals 3500cals. so you need to burn 14000cals more than you consume each week. exercise is VERY important.<br>  <br>  here is a link to find out how many calories you need to maintain your weight... you'll need to cut that down and add enough exercise to equal you burning 1750 more than you eat each day.try cardio, its a big fat burner.<br>  <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/cc/calories-burned.php" rel="nofollow">http://caloriecount.about.com/cc/calorie...</a><br>  <br>  ps.... it's going to be nearly impossible unless you have a will of steal. also fairly dangerous. why not try 10-15bs instead?|`|OtqlpgMtaa	alli?|`|wZSMDrCfaa	I too would love to look good in a bikini|`|tqR1HRKzaa	i understand why you would ask here due to the limited amount of info available from the "www" on this subject.  i would say your only chance of losing 20 - 30 ! lbs in a little over a month are slim- pun intended!- a hack saw would up your chances some....or serious illness.....you should probably readjust your goals and say you want to lose say 5 lbs of fat before april and try to continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle....this is made up of the never heard before diet and excercise.....excercise is when you move your body in a way until you sweat - you will recognize this when you are dreading doing these types of activities....diet is when you stop eating the things you really want and replace them with things that if there werent other people around you you would spit them out....also in my experience once someone no longer looks good in a bikini they will never do so again - even with weightloss......i would suggest a one piece with a skirt!|`|Q7bXrHqPaa	well, you should do aerobic exercises like walking, running, bicycling. preferably in the morning. weight lifting burns fat. you should eat a lot of dark green vegetables, blueberries, fish, tomatoes, whole grains, and other fruits. they speed up your metabolism.

Also tell your stylist that you want highlights two or three shades lighter and lowlights two shades darker than your natural color level.  Make sure that your base color is your natural color level.   I hope this helps!|`|bdbe26a9206a720e1017d4f8f6a87178aa	just tell her that u want THIN SLICED highlights and lowlights.<br>  tell her u want back to back foils. what that means is that you whole head will be foiled, and u can pick like 2 colors, like a brown and maybe like a dark alburn color and then she will put some of the blonde in for the highlights. lowlights are colors not blonde streaks.....the back to back folis are pretty expensive, so i would just recommend that u just do that on the top part of your head. it is totally up to u and this will give you more of a dimensional look.|`|df7c80bc85bbb7a50ef000248f2db619aa	Just tell her what you mean and maybe get a picture of someone with these highlights.|`|e96c7030b010072a75cf1e3e3800f334aa	Maybe lowlights and highlights or contrasting.

If you feel a bit more confident, then purple eyeshadow really makes green eyes pop. Don't add too much though, especially since you're young. For brands that are good, try some Covergirl or Maybelline. If you need some good brushes, there is a brand that Target sells called Sonya Kashuk, and those brushes are great. Play around with stuff until you find what you like, make-up is all personal preference. :) <br>  Hope that helped at least start you out.

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.<br>  <br>  Amber eyes are a very light brown with strong yellow tones.<br>  <br>  The best colors to use on the eyes are purples and blues.

Opt for a smokey plum, it would really suit your skin tone as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|WDS2DASnaa	well my best friend has amber eyes and she always uses gold/bronzy shadow and brown eyeliner. for a fun color she uses light green or olive; they both look great and play up her eye color.

You need a light touch with the darker colors though.  If you are under 35 pink and gold shimmer eyeshadows are pretty too.  I have the same complexion only with green eyes.  Sometimes I will use the color as eyeliner and just wear mascara and go.  Always wear brown mascara, never black.  Use a good moisturizer and skip the foundation.|`|xOFagjFLaa	wow, you sound like me. :X<br>  haha, go with light eye shadow colors.<br>  Blue eyeshadow is so cute for us, light bright colors like yellow, orange, green, blue, anything thats bright.<br>  put on black eyeliner, it goes well with bright eyeshadows believe it or not.<br>  match your outfits, and put on blush.

So try the oranges, the golds, the browns. It will give you the summery kinda look, and you can mix and match a lot of other colors with the bronzes. Like green and brown with gold on eye shadow, and make sure your blush is not pink it has to give you a sun kissed look so go for a darker one, and finish with lip gloss!  Make sure you wear mascara and eyeliner to make your eyes stand out.|`|241097d380afbd16463bab910ee994cbaa	Well, it's summer, so lighter make up is just fine. Opt for a tinted-moisturizer instead of a thick or cakey foundation. An inexpensive tinted moisturized is Jane Nearly Foundation, it has an SPF 30 in it as well, you can find it at Walmart. To keep you lips from being sunburnt, and to enhance your light skin, try Neautrogena lip shears. They come in 6 different colors, and they too have SPF, they add a nice shine to your lips. Use a mascara that doesn't clump, a good one is Maybellene Define-A-Lash. Don't wear eyeliner on the bottom on your eyelid, that's too dramatic for summer. Instead, since you have blue eyes, try a mocha-brown liquid (or pencil) eyeliner on the top lashline of your eyes. It will bring out the blue and make your eyes pop, and good brand for liquid eyeliner is Almay, or Jane Eye-Zing. Last, finish your look with some bronzer or blush. With a powder brush, dust blush or bronzer (bronzer is a good option for summer) on the apples of your cheeks, nose, and forehead.<br>  <br>  Enjoy !<br>  I hope this helped.

I too have a heart shaped face, and a baby face, and I recently got my hair cut similar to this (just not quite as short in the back), and I love how it looks. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|EGlSesYjaa	Trim your bangs, just enough so they frame you your heart shaped face... (Cut it so the bangs settle around the top of your cheekbones). Layer the rest of your hair and have the bottom of your cut end about an inch or two past your shoulders. This will highlight your cheeks and frame your face into the slim heart shape it already is!|`|vOFQQK0Waa	the right medium hair style=the sides pulled back behind the ears help slimdown the face down,while no bangs show off more forehead and therefore a longer shape.the off centre part helps divide the face evenly making it longer than wider face.it gives an oval faceshape..<br>  <br>  the right longer hair style=soft layered look is fabulous.the middle part helps to divide the face into two longer portion while the absence of bangs doesnt compromise any vertical length.straight hair would actually more suitable and slimmer in design.try it.
l6BXtHutaa	Uhm, I think it'll be easier to answer the question if you were more specific in what you're asking. The word "makeup" covers a large variety of products and tips, from eyeshadow to your nail color. If you're just a beginning, there are some tips I can offer.<br>  <br>  Eyes:<br>  When you're starting off with makeup, most people start with either eyeliner or mascara. If you already have well-defined eyes and thick, curly lashes; there really isn't a point in wearing any eye makeup.<br>  If you do decide to start wearing eyeliner and mascara though, here are some tips:<br>  Eyeliner: <br>        When applying eyeliner, start in the center of your lash line and slowly work out in small strokes to the outer and inner corners of your eye. Do only the top lid for a natural look. I've seen very inexperienced eyelining and it's just not pretty.<br>  Brands recommended: Revlon ColorStay, Almay<br>  Mascara:<br>        Mascara is easy to use, take your mascara wand and wiggle it at the roots of your lashes and lift up. Apply as many coats as desired, but keep in mind that too many coats could clump or smudge.<br>  Brands recommended: CoverGirl, Maybelline<br>  <br>  If you're a semi-experienced makeup user and you've decided to take up eyeshadow, here are some more tips.<br>  Eyeshadow:<br>        Use a cream eyeshadow as a base, I recommend NYX Jumbo Eyeshadow Pencils. It has a very creamy texture and will create a nice base for your powder eyeshadow to grab on to. Next, apply on a powder eyeshadow with a crease brush and blend. If the eyeshadow you're using doesn't seem very pigmented, spray a little bit of water on the brush (don't rinse it, you'll just rinse the shadow away) then blend it on your lids - it's been proven to make the shadow more pigmented.<br>  <br>  Face:<br>  It is not recommended for young people to use foundation, but if you have dark eye circles or you'd like to hide some blemishes; a concealer could be considered. As for pressed powder and oil-absorbing sorts, it's not really necessary unless you don't have time to blot an oil-absorbing sheet on your face. Personally, pressed powder makes my face look somewhat cakey, which was not the objective I was going for.<br>  Concealer:<br>        I like Neutrogena's liquid concealers because they have ingredients in there that can help reduce redness. As for powder concealer, L'Oreal Bare Naturale makes decent ones. When applying liquid concealer, apply it with your ring finger on whichever part, then blend it with your ring finger in a rolling motion. Your ring finger is the most gentle finger of your hand, and if you find that sponges work great for you. Go ahead and use it.<br>  Foundation:<br>        Foundation should be worn on special occasions when you need flawless skin (dance parties, formal events) but not to be used on a daily basis. The reason is because foundation could age your skin faster than you wanted. If you absolutely have to wear foundation everyday, use a mineral based foundation, like Everyday Minerals. For liquid, I suggest Revlon's Custom Creation or the ColorStay line. Blend it with one of those wedge sponges.<br>  Blush:<br>        It is used to give you a hint of color on your cheeks so you look healthy. Apply it with a powder brush on the apples of your cheeks (the part that becomes raised when you're smiling), and blend. A cream blush is recommended to make a base for powder blush, but in the morning there isn't really that much time to go through that hassle, so on a daily basis I just use powder blush. Apply on forehead and chin too to get an all-over face glow.<br>  Brands recommended: N.Y.C., CoverGirl, Maybelline<br>  <br>  Lips:<br>  Lipstick, lip balm, lip gloss. Pretty self-explanatory. The only problem is the texture and shine. I recommend Victoria's Secret Beauty Rush lip gloss for a sheer, very shiny finish. If you'd like some color, CoverGirl and Revlon makes decent ones for a reasonable price. The choice between sponge tip and slant-tip applicators depends on your liking. I like the sponge-tip ones when applying over lipstick and the slant-tip ones to apply over bare lips. For lipstick, Revlon makes very good, pigmented (given it's lipstick, anything not pigmented should just be considered as a tinted lip balm), creamy ones that goes on smoothly.<br>  <br>  I know this is pretty long, but I think it's worth it to read.<br>  Any questions, comments, email me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|IOcgqIBvaa	Id is the name of the label and it is very good,  I have been using that for 2 years and I am very happy with that. |`|L8fkYUvQaa	It's best to ask a specific question so you'll get all answers you need. :P <br>  <br>  Natural light is your best bet for getting a natural-looking face when putting on make-up.

003cd0132324a274d700be03b2ebb83baa	witch hazel is a good toner, it removes excess oil and closes pores, like all good toners are supposed to do, but I find that it is also very drying, skin actually feels stretched and that is never good, so make sure you use a moisturizer and not sure if it really helps with scars, but since it is good for the skin, it does help the over all look and feel.<br>  <br>  The bio oil website says it can be used on the face, but try and avoid the t zone, and use it only at night as it doesn't have sunscreen |`|g6rndFataa	Witch Hazel is great as a toner but for traditionally used for sunburn/ wind burn et al.  Rosehip oil would be better for scars but be careful with aromatherapy oils - add few drops only to a base oil like Jojoba/ Sweet Almond.|`|AA11728784	Witch Hazel is good for cleaning the skin.

Finally, present all of the facts to your mom and talk it over with her.  Even offer to take her with you when you get the piercing.  There must be a reason why she is against you getting piercings.

Do you think I'm addicted to porn.<br>  Yes I do. Like every addiction  it will be hard to quit. But you can do it! Just pray to God and he will help you. Trust me he will..|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	1. Not going to hell....our God is a forgiving God<br>  2. Yes, you broke your promise...but he forgives<br>  3. You like porn a lot, sort of addicted, but then so am I<br>  4. Yes, it's normal...especially for a girl<br>  <br>  It's natural don't worry about it.  You'll do it less as you get older.  Enjoy !|`|ActoZyHraa	Its totally normal for someone your age to be doing this, <br>  i have watched porn many atime, have not once felt guilty about it ^_^|`|Fa6eAG6Taa	btw I am not religious in the slightest bit. But this is what religion does to people, it gets them freaked out that for doing something toally normal they will go to hell or be "punished" . And also makes then think that because they pray everything will be good when life doesn't work like that. So no you are not going to hell, I think you broke your promise however you technically didn't, I don't think you're addicted to porn, it's perfectly normal at your age, yeah, it's a good thing to be able to orgasm alot, some women never orgasm. <br>  Anyway isn't "God" supposed to forgive no matter what?<br>  <br>  You don't have to pray to ask for forgiveness! You did nothing wrong! It's normal for teenagers to look at porn and masturbate!<br>  <br>  You also don't need to quit porn!|`|l737Fkh1aa	I am a seventeen and I used to be just like you, except for the masturbating part. I stopped and now I answer these questions.<br>  1. Not if you repent truly.<br>  2.What promise? Well, you did not have sex with a guy, so no.<br>  3.Yes. Just go on the internet and do something else. I stopped a long time ago.<br>  4.I don't know if it is normal. I think it is. Most women are not normal and cannot orgasm.|`|nQFQaEngaa	1. No you are not going to Hell.<br>  2. Well you know God ALWAYS FORGIVES!<br>  3. No its normal for teens your age to be watching porn<br>  4. Yes it is. It is natural|`|DjJwKc9Caa	no frigging way, THAT'S HOT!!!!!!!|`|pgwao1luaa	Slow down your a child in her prim. We were made to pre create and at your age it would be considered normal, but in our society your not to have even experienced the joyous feelings. I say as long as your not having unprotected sex what your feeling is natural don't be afraid be smart but than again how can you be when your not supposed to be experiencing this already. Sorry about the last sentence just covering my own as_. Be safe and think don't compromise yourself what your feeling is that natural animal.Your starting to blossom and what god has to say should not be ignored. Marriage is a wonderful thing that two people share while enjoying each other and creating children. Slow down don't be to eager to explore all things that you read fantasy is just that and sometimes its better left just that.<br>  Your young ripe and ready for picking be SAFE!|`|j5k0VRbPaa	omg justt brace urself people go throw this every day|`|HeOwMaxaaa	1. NO your not<br>  2. not technically<br>  3. your nit addictied you just like to. its normal even i watch it! im 16 btw<br>  4. yes it normal to masturbate till you orgasm everytime...

Is there any chance you could try it on or return if you don't like it cuz then you should try 4 and 6.|`|7YPdogmDaa	is your waist smaller or bigger? either way you can get it altered. If your waist is smaller, get the 4 and have it altered smaller to fit your waist. If bigger get the 6 and have the bust and hips altered to fit. Pretty dress btw|`|Oejricveaa	That is an awesome dress!! Its beautiful!<br>  <br>  I would go with the size of you waist. Ex. if you are 28 waist than get size 6. If you get size 4 and it is too tight for you to wear than your out of luck. But if you have it a little loose on your chest or hips than a seamstress can fix it for you.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a seamstress near you or you don't have time than I would call the dress company and ask them for advise.|`|eYmIlVnGaa	get the 6 and just pin up the areas that are too loose because you can always pin a dress tighter but if your waist wont fit it will look terrible!
Gk4kNAWsaa	YES!<br>  <br>  you are very pretty and have a great smile--just think how beautiful it will be once you get your braces off. as you are now, even with your braces, you could model, no problem.<br>  <br>  5"9' at only 15? that means you'll be closer to 6 foot after high school. (from 18 to 20 years old, i grew another 3 inches taller and 2 shoe sizes bigger!)<br>  <br>  soooooo, do you want to be a catalog/ad model, or a runway model? i suggest that you go right in to runway. sometimes girls that start out in ads never get out of that. <br>  <br>  sky's the limit. you're young, and have time to prepare yourself for a year at least. don't wait too long. get in it as soon as you can and start practicing your walk and posing. you'll do great.<br>  <br>  good luck and every blessing from oregon,<br>  rachelle|`|LdRAsccPaa	go for it|`|TvODH2lTaa	You're certainly attractive enough to be a model BUT unfortunately you're not a minority and you're a girl which means you'd be competing against millions of other white girls for jobs.  My son did a bit of modeling and we constantly saw jobs going to people who have an exotic look or are minorities.  White folks, especially girls, are a dime a dozen in the modeling business.  <br>  <br>  Auditioning is a horrible process, you wait for hours for an audition just to not get a job and you have to do that A LOT.|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	well idk u haveta get rid of ur braces and maybe a little bit taller..|`|GexgmXMJaa	well giving us ur height doesn't cut it.|`|E52IOIpEaa	your not unique your kind of average.<br>  <br>  answer mine:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkTXMnl1WPEiWuW1yNe_iPnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225123644AABNUrs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|v8pl2RLUaa	You're fine.

Once you lose those braces I think you'd make a wonderful model.|`|7d8a232729948aa43d4cfa13bdc6648faa	You are pretty but the thing is, you just don't look too much like the model type|`|eYmIlVnGaa	how much do you weigh? your face is very symmetrical and your thin so I would say yes.|`|c3j49t9Faa	You are cute.  You look more like a beautiful volleyball player|`|7YPdogmDaa	ok your 5'9"...i looked at your pic but cant tell, what size are you, weight maybe...i think youre pretty enough, and your height is right.|`|r1wdahkKaa	you would make a great model :)|`|8iR6XOD7aa	honestly your healthly looking and models are super skinny.|`|kJ8bUIRIaa	maybe|`|lwJb9NUEaa	That's a really loaded question sweetheart<br>  <br>  Almost everyone has model potential.<br>  <br>  I'm a photographer training to become a fashion photographer and I have seen all kinds of girls become models. <br>  <br>  You have the right build that the runways are looking for but us photographers are much more picky.<br>  <br>  I can't really tell from that photo because it wasn't taken by a professional.<br>  <br>  You obviously still have a bit of growing up to do, but it looks like the tall and skinny that modeling agencies like but the important thing is to know how to work with the camera.<br>  <br>  See if you can set up a photo shoot, ask your parents, save up some money (most photo shoots are quite pricy. I charge per print $20 bucks and I'm extremely cheap!) Practice poses and faces in the mirror.<br>  <br>  Only the lens can tell.<br>  <br>  I have a model that I use often, and looking at her you wouldn't be able to tell that she's so great behind the lens because she has sort of an awkward facial structure, but when she gets in front of my camera she completely changes and uses those awkward angles to her advantage.<br>  <br>  I would definitely prescribe some America's Next Top Model to you, just ignore all of the drama and pay attention to what the professionals say on there.|`|WbmVPS5Haa	Okay so here is my analysis:<br>  <br>  - Get some deshine formula for your face<br>  - Volumnize your hair<br>  - Wear heels<br>  - How tall are you? Most models are taller than 5'8, other than that it is useless<br>  - Don't smile (even though you have a nice one) <br>  - Wear clothes that show your curves<br>  <br>  I don't know if modeling is a promising career, it only last about 7 - 15 years and most models are not famous anymore. Try marketing or Fashion journalism if you want to get a foot in first.|`|QnB84dZQaa	Height, good. But the braces. You'll have to wait and see in a few more years. You're in that "awkward stage" and modeling is so competitive. But you're not ugly.|`|wSA5oF3caa	Well I think that when you get your braces off, then you could rock the runway! your really pretty too BTW.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	no, sorry sweetcakes...................|`|xbez1qBPaa	I'd say yeah. But what do I know about fashion?

You can do better than modeling... unless you are just really dumb, then go for it. Your face does kind of resemble a foot, though.|`|PbykKE2oaa	No.. not runway modeling.<br>  <br>  But you do have a commercial look, so you can do catalog modeling.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	need to lose weight, although you look good not model thin. and you're face is not special,. i guess you could do commercial modeling|`|wCVSwm2Kaa	go for it!|`|HPtpfqFJaa	Yes, especially since you are 5'9''! Go for it girl! You are not unbeleivably gorgeous or anything but you are really pretty and you have the body for it.|`|NeTLzyE4aa	Yes you are model height & Size for it. But to look more like a model you should wait to you get your braces taken off and wear your hair up to make your neck look longer|`|m9osOHefaa	You're very pretty. If your talking about the kind of modeling like they do on America's Next Top Model, then no. But you could maybe get a modeling job at somewhere like Delia's or Charlotte Russe.|`|SMX228Olaa	You have the face of a 10 year old girl.|`|uM7U7Bkvaa	You don't look 15.

QtBdOWYTaa	Try taking her with you when you are going to go bra shopping somewhere like Victoria's Secret. When the gal comes into the fitting room to help you ask her to approach your friend and ask if she's ready to try something on and once she sees herself in a really well constructed bra that holds the girls in place she'll get the idea...<br>  Offer if you can to buy it for her...Money could always be an object for her and what she has...|`|KasFZL7laa	tell her that you didn't want to have to say it but that a lot of people make fun of her for it and it would make a huge improvement on her appearance if she would wear the correct bra.  suggest helping her and go shopping at victoria's secret!|`|QevBVANtaa	Tell her u don't wanna hang out with her unless she wears a bra.

WYa3UY6Gaa	....<br>  <br>  I don't get how NOT believing in god is something that's meaningful. I mean usually something that you believe in is something that's meaningful.<br>  <br>  Like I don't believe in aliens, but that's not meaningful, and I wouldn't get a tattoo of it. ( does that make sense ) <br>  <br>  I mean I'm not saying this because you are atheist I mean I could care less what you do/don't believe in doesn't make you who you are. I just *don't* think an "atheist" tattoo is something to look into. Usually atheist tattoos are just an A with a design or atheist written in a cool design.

You find images (don't look for tattoos) that are important to you, or you like, or you are interested in, or you feel have personal meaning, or you think is pretty, or has to do with your family, or has to do with the books you read, or the things that you do, or doodles that you draw, or art work that you like, stuff from history, the beginning of man, the planet Zerod, your past life, your simultaneous existence, ....etc. etc. etc.<br>  Try pretending that you have never seen another person or tattoo ... uhh, and you live on an island, and you decided to adorn your body with tattoos. What would you choose to put on your skin?<br>  It may be a bug you find interesting, or a dream that you had, ... whatever. The less it comes from anyone else, the better.

But, what are you asking for, an Atheist themed tattoo?  I find it hard to believe that in life, there is nothing meaningful to either of you.  What do you enjoy doing?  What are your hobbies?  Do you like/love your family?  <br>  <br>  You appear to be young, and I would encourage you to wait before you get a tattoo.  You have no idea what you want, and at this stage in your life, you are still impressionable.  Don't get anything you would regret in case you have a change in beliefs, you never know what will happen in life.  <br>  <br>  Your relationship may not last forever, and would you want that to be a representation of a possibly horrible end to what is now the best relationship ever?  Just some things to think about!!!|`|6mZJSqBgaa	It IS okay to have a tattoo that serves strictly aesthetic purposes only.  I think people should get stuff they love and/or will look good on them and not get caught up in the "meaning."

UByvC54Xaa	First of all - you wash your hair with a residue-free shampoo. Secondly, you don't condition your dreads. Where the hell do these ppl come up with these answers?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about using product as wax can hinder the dreading process.<br>  <br>  Backcombing will work fine. for a good video on backcombing, check out knottyboy.com and just ignore the part where they try to sell you stuff that you really dont need. Perhaps invest in some good, dreadlock shampoo though, a metal lice comb and a heap of small snagless bands for your dreads.<br>  <br>  If you have started again several times - your hair could break off it is too damaged. And it isnt advisable to use one method for half a dread and another for the remainder - it will be quite obvious.|`|aFzqYyLSaa	just don't wash your hair. You'll be there in no time|`|v8E68R0maa	Just wash and condition your hair ever single day and never comb it! When you are just sitting down doing nothing twist big strands of your hair and once you do that, you've got dreadlocks!
N687m1EOaa	First off, use a combination cleanser to clean your face with nothing scented in it, i recomend neutrogina. DON'T use a moisturizer, that's the worst thing you can do. When your buying your makeup, look for something that is more of a tinted liquid, and apply it with a makeup sponge.|`|z09g8ZVWaa	after you wash your face, use a good toner. It like moisturizes your face. You should use a toner like lancome(i think i spelled it right). Im not sure how much it costs since i got it as a gift but if it is extremely dry, get a good brand.|`|bT9SXnYQaa	Drink lots of water!! I used to have the same problem, so I drank at least 4 cups a day. Within a couple weeks, my dry skin and some of the oilyness was gone. I also started using exfoliants instead of just cleansers, so that did wonders.    The make-up, I use press powder, but I apply it with a brush, in little circular motions. It looks way more natural than caking it on.
V3adr5MYaa	i had to do the same thing. i had to take piercings out for work   i would take them out for work (8-12) hours and then go home and put them back in.    no issues except my bridge piercing got a little aggravated but nothing bad at all. i also had to take out my lip ring and nose ring. both did fine.
