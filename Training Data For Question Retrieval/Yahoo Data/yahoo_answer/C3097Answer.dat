AEZ75dJ7aa	This is all I have come up with hope this helps---<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it true that a 1943 wheat penny is worth about a million dollars?<br>  In: Coins and Paper Money  <br>  <br>    [Edit]  <br>  The Story of the 1943 Cent <br>  No, it's not true. At best the value is overrated; at worst, there's one important piece of information missing. <br>  <br>  1943 was a unique year for making cents. The USA needed as many raw materials as possible to fight World War II. Copper was an invaluable material in the war effort. Congress and/or the President decided to change the materials used to make cents; instead of the copper-based alloy used previously, cents were made out of zinc-coated steel. This gave them a unique look, of course. It also caused quite a few problems, as the zinc coating turned out to be somewhat incompatible with steel, but that's another story. By 1944, the Mint was instructed to revert to the previously used copper-heavy alloy. <br>  <br>  Blank coins were held in giant bins. Often blank coins from a previous use of a bin would still be in the bin for the next run. In this case, a bin used to mint 1942 cents still had a few blank copper cents in them. As a result, very few 1943 copper cents were struck. '''These''' coins can be worth tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars ... but not a million. <br>  <br>  When people found out about the rarity of the 1943 copper cents, they tried to beat the system. Two ways this was done was to copper-plate a standard 1943 cent, and to alter a 1948 cent to look like a 1943 cent. Today, about 80 to 90 certified 1943 copper cents have been found; these are believed to be the only ones that were actually minted and survive to this day. If you have a "regular looking" 1943 cent, chances are it's one of the forgeries. Since even a plated 1943 cent will be attracted to a magnet, testing for a plated 1943 steel cent is easy. Spotting an altered 1948 cent, however, is more difficult; you have to know what to look for. A coin dealer specializing in error coins should be able to do this. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer <br>  <br>  No. '43 wheat pennies vary in value from 30 to 70 cents.|`|CfuhIu0Faa	Copper penny fetches more than $400,000<br>  18th century coin's owners descendantsof Declaration signer<br>  <br>  updated 8:12 p.m. PT, Mon., Feb. 21, 2005<br>  BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - A copper penny minted in 1792 and kept in a tobacco tin for decades was auctioned Monday for $437,000.

gpeOH11Daa	Depends on how you sent it. Mail can take up to 7 days depending when it was picked up by transit.  If you sent it priority, it should be guaranteed in 3-5 days. <br>  <br>  You should always send certified so you have proof of receipt on receiving end returned to you once delivered.  And you cant count Sundays.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|qxrr69bnaa	I would expect it to get there on the 27th.  The only service the USPS "guarantees" is Express Mail.  Priority Mail is NOT a guaranteed service.
wtui2yGTaa	check out the neighborhood and see if anyone needs yard work, errands done, if u can use lawnmower try to get some grass cutting jobs.  check with guidance counselor at ur school and get some ideas from them or they might have a list of jobs u can apply for.|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	Are you good with animals?  If you are try dog walking.  Or grass cutting or cleaning out the garage, or helping an elderly person. Talk to your parents and see if there is anything they recommend you do around the house.  There are plenty of things to do but if you take on the responsibility remember you must do the work and do it to the best of your ability.  Good Luck!

If you do you can look up nutritionists ither online or in the book they sent you. If you get insurance through your company they will have the book. If you copy the names and type them into yahoo search reviews will appear. Also, what i recommend, is you call a physician (yours, or if you don't have one anyone will do) and get a recommendation. They will always recommend someone who are qualified. If they recommend you they have recommended others.
