A ovula??o (libera??o do óvulo pelo ovário) marca o meio do ciclo menstrual e geralmente ocorre em torno de 14 dias antes do primeiro dia (início) da próxima menstrua??o. A ovula??o representa o período de maior fertilidade da mulher. Calculando o dia provável da ovula??o, ainda temos que levar em conta uma "margem de seguran?a" de 5 dias antes e 5 dias depois, onde existe risco grande de gravidez.)<br>  <br>  <br>  3- A sua menstrua??o atrasou mais do que o normal?<br>  <br>  4- Você sentiu sintomas de gravidez?<br>  <br>  (manchas na pele, aumento do volume abdominal, altera??es das mamas e enj?os)<br>  <br>  5- Você fez exame de sangue ou ultrassonografia?<br>  <br>  (A rede pública de saúde faz o teste de gravidez gratuito.

O periodo mestrual é contado a partir do primeiro dia que sua mesntrua??o "desceu". A data mais critica é a partir do 13 ao 20 dia. Tive duas gesta??es, uma foi no 14 e outra no 16, uma amiga teve no 19...Portanto n?o confie em tabelinha. A pilula do dia seguinte só deve ser tomada em ocasi?es especias, n?o sempre q fiar com medo e deve ser tomada em até 12 horas apos o ato e repetida nas proximas 24h.<br>  Agora cuidado, previna-se. é bem melhor doque ficar depois rancando os cabelos de preocupa??o. Procure o Centro de Saúde mais proximo a sua residencia. Lá terá toda uma equipe preparada para lhe atender e lhe ajudar a escolher o melhor metodo. O C.S. fornece gratuitamente, camisinhas masculinas e femininas, pilulas anticoncepcionais,  tb as inje??es contraceptivas e coloca??o de Diu em quem já teve filhos.|`|bd218bb1292d8f73471659b81a9e3362aa	Provavelmente n?o, embora vc n?o possa ter certeza.<br>  <br>  Com 2 ou 3 dias depois da sua menstrua??o vc ainda n?o está no periodo fertil de novo, mas sempre existem as excess?es...<br>  Algumas mulheres tem mais facilidade ás vezes de ovular 2 óvulos no mes (o caso de mulheres que engravidam de gemeos ou até mais, e os gemeos n?o s?o identicos e pode até acontecer de nascer uma menina e um menino da mesma gesta??o), e ás vezes pode ter sido eliminado na sua menstrua??o apenas um óvulo e o outro ficar, por isso nem sempre é t?o seguro seguir a tabela. Mas fica calma que isso é muito dificil de se acontecer, mas como previnir nunca é de mais, se fizer menos de dois dias que vc teve a rela??o sexual, tome a pilula do dia seguinte, que ainda tem grandes porcentagens de funcionar.<br>  <br>    Mas querida, se ainda persistirem as dúvidas, faz um exame... é melhor do que ficar na dúvida, n?o?<br>  <br>  <br>  Bjosssssssssss|`|ce8d73609b43b6e830320cee63a89b51aa	eu n?o qual seria o pior:<br>  1) voce estar gravida - e mais um sem pai no mundo<br>  2) n?o estar, e continuar na promiscuidade<br>  3) abortar, e cometeres mais um crime.<br>  <br>  Todas op??es n?o prestam, devido a ignorancia em obter uns segundos de prazer.|`|dac9c373f064ba5d7ba178ae12b36592aa	Se voce deu gostoso e estava fértil pode estar...|`|02eac52415d845a1f715f6994d31484eaa	N?o deve estar. mas lê a resposta do Mestre Frenando com aten??o.

O gemido vem por causa da respira??o ofegante, a sensa??o que se vai perder o f?lego, que vai faltar o ar, que os pés v?o sair do ch?o, que a gente vai subir as nuvens. é um gemido gostoso de prazer e n?o de dor. Sim o gemido é um ato involuntário, vai depender dos pontos onde o penis vai tocar na mulher, e vice versa, onde as partes mais intimas e scretas da vulva, v?o pressionar o penis. Quanto a melhor idade para perder a virgindade, n?o existe um parametro. Pode acontecer a qualquer momento nos dias de hoje, devido a educa??o irresponsável que é passada aos nossos adolescentes, mas o ideal é que aconte?a entre pessoas que se amem de verdade, e tenham maturidade suficiente para arcar com as consequencias. A vrigindade em si e apenas um tabu. A mulher continua sendo a mesma, sua vagina continua do mesmo jeito, somente a ela cabe estar guardando a sete chaves este segredo ou n?o.

zzOR31Beaa	This might be immoral to some but it is out of care.  You must get your daughter drunk and slip some georgia homeboy in her drink.  Once she is sedated, you must have sex with her yourself.  If you pop her cherry, that means your the first and that your daughter is going down the right track.  If not, Im sorry your sweetheart is no longer pure and you must put her up for adoption!|`|rBq189W1aa	Good. That means she's finally realised that her body is her property, not yours.<br>  <br>  If you want to make sure she's not pregnant, give her information about, and access to, safe, reliable contraception options.<br>  <br>  You can give her all the rings and lectures and threats you want, but your daughter will start having sex when *she* decides she's ready, not when you do. You don't have to like it, but you might as well accept it.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I'm not sure what religion you belong to, but that is a little overboard, it's almost like having her wear a chastity belt.

A ring isn't enough to keep sperm out, sorry.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	well its her vagina not yours.  either you trust or you dont|`|T6QeWeehaa	Well if you want your "sweetheart" not to be pregnant then get her some sort of protection dont just " hope she will use condoms" You have to take her to the doctors or tell her to go and take the pill or an implant or something like that. Its not encouraging her to be sexually active its just making sure shes safe and you have to just trust her not to be a slut. Shes 16 so she can have sex if you want her too or not. A ring doesnt stop you from having sex|`|rpsXPdFmaa	There's many reasons she might not want to wear it, ranging from it doesn't fit right to she's not longer a virgin.  Though really she could have easily continued to wear the ring, say she's not had sex and done it anyway.<br>  <br>  You can't tell she's lying without a lie detector test really.  And I doubt you could get that done.  You could trust her.  You could watch for signs of pregnancy like a hawk.  You could have safe sex talks with her.  Just remember you can't judge her virginity by whether or not she wears a ring.|`|qYeqmMhVaa	Unfortunately, she's too old to be controlled. She could still wear the ring and no longer be a virgin. It's just a ring. Sit her down and ask her about prom. Instead of nagging her whether she's had sex. Ask her if she used a condom. She'll either say "Yes" "No" or "I didn't have sex!" Even then you won't know for sure if she's lying until she leaves her diary out to be found or you intercept a phone call conversation.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	The only way to tell if she's pregnant is to wait for her period, then have her take a test.
dxlNwGuWaa	Sorry to say it, but it really does sound like an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy.  <br>  When hcg's are over 2000, they would expect to see at least a gestational sac in the uterus.<br>  <br>  If this is a tubal pregnancy, you could very well have bled on the 7th of april-with my tubal pregnancy, i got my 'period', but it was not typical of my usual periods, but i just put it down to one of those things.<br>  <br>  He is probably only allowing you one more set of bloods and one more ultrasound, as if he leaves it much longer, and this is an ectopic, you are at imminent risk of rupture.  The sooner they find the pregnancy, the less destructive it will be.  If it hasn;t ruptured they may be able to save your fallopian tube.  <br>  Unfortunately, if the pregnancy is tubal, the baby will not survive.<br>  <br>  My advice? Don't leave the hospital tomorrow until they have found the location of the pregnancy, and be on the look out for any signs of deterioration, such as severe pains, shoulder tip pain, bleeding, dizzy spells and diarhoea.<br>  <br>  Please visit <a href="http://www.ectopic.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.ectopic.org.uk</a> - this site is a godsend to all women who are concerned they may be/have experiencing an ectopic pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I really hope that this isn't the case, but it is important you are prepared.|`|WpflEDFEaa	The hormones don't lie.  As long as they are going up and not down, it's a good sign.  My first ultrasound was at 8 and 1/2 weeks, my dr wouldn't do one any sooner because she said they wouldn't see anything (Found out was prego at 3 1/2 weeks), Thats why they waited, they didnt want me to get all worried if we couldn't see the embryo which is a big possibility if the US is done too early.  Best of luck to you!|`|mDsFeDtcaa	The HCG levels rising is a good sign that the pregnancy is progressing.  My guess is that you're not quite 6 weeks pregnant yet. I went to the ER with cramping and spotting when I was right at 6 weeks and they were able to see a heartbeat.  (did you have an internal ultrasound or a regular ultrasound? They found my baby's heartbeat with an internal one...and I think they should have been able to view the ovaries and tubes with that as well.)<br>  I can't believe they wouldn't do a laparoscopy immediately if they suspected a tubal pregnancy. Not to scare you, but my friend had a tubal pregnancy and it ruptured her tube and was quite serious.  <br>  The "period" you had on April 7th could have been implantation bleeding.  Good luck, I hope the best for you.|`|AA11981363	well you are def pregnant since your hcg levels keep raising. I went for my 1st ultrasound at 7 weeks and the baby was right there, so you could be having a tubal pregnancy, and those are not viable. Then again I am not a doctor, you need to wait til tomorrow to see what your doctor has to say about it.

9d9c4f55361a135f055daed792787ef7aa	Hay una manera que te puede servir que depende de cuándo hacerlo respecto al día de ovulación.<br>  Lo que sucede es que los espermatozoides Y, que dan lugar a un ni?o, se mueven más rápido pero son menores, más delicados, más débiles y viven menos tiempo, por lo tanto mueren más pronto si la fecundación no se realiza en las primeras horas después a la relación sexual. Por el contrario, los espermatozoides X, que dan nacimiento a una ni?a, se mueven más lento pero son de mayor tama?o, más resistentes y viven más tiempo, por lo tanto aguantan más la espera de la ovulación. <br>  <br>  Por consiguiente, si tienes relaciones sexuales en los días más cercanos a la ovulación, hay mayores probabilidades de que fecunde un espermatozoide veloz y nazca un bebé del sexo masculino. En cambio, si la concepción se da unos 3 ó 4 días antes de la ovulación, hay más probabilidades de que los espermatozoides Y no resistan hasta la ovulación, y quien fecunde sea un espermatozoide X, dando lugar a una ni?a.

Any other person would be happy b/c they didn't have to go to work! I was sooooo upsetI couldn't go!! Just this past Sunday I cried and cried b/c my cat scratched my face. I was sobbing and saying to my b'f at the same time, "Gabe (cat) doesn't love me anymore!! He never lets me hold him!!!". LMAO!!! I had a good laugh 15 minutes later over how rediculous this was.|`|0fa8cecdd79ffd76d48c4c83b19e75b3aa	OMG!!! I cry over everything..my poor hubby...last week it snowed and iced and I got off from work but he still had to go in and I was crying...balling because he was leaving me...and yesterday I cried because we messed up the chair rail and part of the wall in the nursery and we have to do it over again, which is good cause it will actually look sooo much better in the long run, but I was soo upset that it go ruined and I cried for a few hours on and off....and today I was in walmart looking at V-day cards for my hubby and I was reading a really sappy one and I started to tear up while I was reading it right in the store!!!|`|8WRnqs08aa	I cry at the drop of a hat. It's ridiculous. My hubby cries & laughs with me. He cries because I am crying, then laughs because sometimes I cry over silly stuff.    A young girl died in a head on accident at the fault of a drunk driver. I bawled as I read the story to my hubby. The girl was a H.S.Senior & would turn 18 the week after her death. I don't know this girl or her family, but I have a son who will be 18 in Sept. (my eyes are welling up as I'm writing). When I read stuff like this during pregnancy, I am more sensitive and only think about "What if that were my child?" My heart aches for these families.    But then, I could cry at something really silly, as you stated; a commercial or A Baby Story, which I am watching right now, too.    I feel so weak, emotionally during pregnancy. I am much stronger when not pregnant, but I've always been an emotional individual.    You're perfectly normal, that or we're both insane...LOL|`|6ITgXvBWaa	I cried when my mom told me to deal with it and there was nothing she could do. I was complaining about the snow.    Another time she went and got me a big mac from mcdonalds and I wanted it without pickles and she forgot and I cried over that.    I break down and cry all the time when I cant figure out what to eat at any time in the day.    Another time my mom went to the grocery store but they were out of Hawaiian bread, so she went to a different one and they too were out. She called me and told me that and I cried over it. So she went to a 3rd store 25 minutes away for it.    I have cried over numerous things that are silly.|`|1da22694eee1f6055b5ea295d06bcf40aa	I cry at the light bulb commercial.

omegLbOAaa	absolutely! if you can't spell & construct a basic sentence, then you're too young to have sex.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Well if your still not to the age that you don't type properly you shouldn't be having sex. That shows your still mentally immature. And having sex you need a lot of maturity... And the fact that he said 'you will do it if you really loved me' shows that he only wants you for what's in your pants. If HE really loved YOU he would be willing to wait as long as you needed him to till your ready. I wouldn't there are a lot of bad things that could happen. Not to mention I'm guessing your still young and it takes a tole on your body. And yeah your first time does hurt. And if your young all the next times will hurt too. I'd just wait.

Someone who's been bullied at school i know they seek out the week point in anyone and start off. Don't let their bullying get to you.      As for this teacher what were her words to show support ? Or did she just listen and keep quiet. Either ways its unacceptable and you should speak to your principle about her behavior.  As for the 13 year old kids !! Its plain immaturity with that desire to be a school bully. Just don't let them see they got to you.|`|0GIV43Fmaa	I'm sorry too. They are just immature and what comes around goes around.

Tell the teacher she offended you and tell her that you don't respect her anymore. She is there for the paycheck like many people who get in a job they find out they don't really like and so shes being sour.

I'm sorry to hear about your class, especially to hear that your teacher was involved in it.  Personally, I would pull the teacher aside and talk to him/her what your background is, how their comment made you feel, and that they really need to show some more sensitivity in the future.  What the kids were saying was crappy, but they're kids and will hopefully get over it as they get older. An adult teacher should know better.     I know that it might be hard to follow my advice about talking to the teacher, but I think it would be the adult thing to do.  They would learn a little bit about adopted people, and you would get a much-deserved apology.|`|HmkCFddAaa	The only losers there were the ones running their mouths. And what kind of teacher would let that go on let alone agree. Some people just let their mouths over run their brains. Don't let them get to you. They may be in for a rude awakening, for they don't know what the future holds for them. They may find later in life they end up divorced or in a bad situation. Like they say what comes around goes around.|`|fYed2Crjaa	I'm sorry you had to go through that. There is no reason why the world is so ignorant it just is. Ignorance is bliss i guess. Just brush it off. They are probably just spoiled assholes that have never had any hardship in their life.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	I would schedule a meeting to talk to the dean (principal?).  The subject matter and discussion created a hostile environment for you and that is a big button pusher with administrative people.  The teacher should get her/his hand slapped and a disciplinary note in the personnel file.    No one should be subjected to insensitivity and ignorance in a classroom.    I'm sorry Temperance.  You shouldn't have to be subjected to that cr@p.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	Sounds like there were many A$$holes in the room.    I am sorry you had to go through that.
g9TxgMlwaa	ahh.. the comforts of pregnancy! No not for now. It's still to early. Unfortunately you just have to live with it for now. Talk to your doctor. They might approve some Tylenol, but from what I can remember I think it's just in the 2nd trimester. But please don't take my advice about Tylenol as a Dr, opinion. I'm not a dr. Best to talk with your dr first. They'll know more about your pregnancy and what is good...  Otherwise just cut out the caffeine, try to cut out naps, go to bed exhausted. And if your in bed and just lying there awake, get out of bed and do something.  I found reading worked for me.|`|hYZIYla0aa	No, do not take anything that is not safe during pregnancy.This drug will be passed through your blood to the unborn child.It is unsafe to take any kind of drugs that make you drowsy.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	its best to ask the doctor. never want to risk your baby's heath by just asking around. but what could help naturally is to drink tea before bed.|`|3CCar4vPaa	Consult a priest.
lSCGJ5cKaa	well im not pregnant right now but a lil over 3 months ago i was in the same situation you were (my daughter was even the same age as yours when i was 37 weeks pregnant) you both are stressed and overwhelmed because of the little bundle of joy soon to come and trying to get a new place believe me i know the feeling. Just take it easy let him know how u feel and trust when i tell you after you have the baby its going to be the biggest relief in the world. btw we still havent found a place....|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Mines being awesome :) But yours is probably just stressed because he realizes he should of taken care of selling the house earlier and he's just taking it out on the wrong person. Since you say he's normally nice. Try talking to him and let him know how much it bothers you.|`|64OsCr8laa	i know how you feel my husband comes home from work and wants to do nothing but sleep..he never does anything at work..or at least thats what he tells me...they just sit around and talk alot..he says he's stressed about fixing to leave the military and all...yes i understand that is stressful but what about me..im just as effected by that to..<br>  <br>  im throwing up 3 and 4 times a day, so tired i can hardly stay awake...just starting to get over dehyration.. and if thats not enough on me my clothes don't fit anymore and i have no energy to go hopping for more ..i try to clean as much as i can but its so hard so he told me i can pay someone to help! why cam't he get off his butt and help?<br>  <br>  and to top off my stress it seemd like every family member calls me to vent where its a rebelling sister or an aunt going through a divorce who now decides they wanna remarry on my birthday!!<br>  <br>  my fathers birthday is tomorrow, my husbands is thursday, my sisters is a week after that and mine is 3 days after hers..<br>  <br>  i have so much to do and no energy to get it done!!<br>  <br>  i think my husband could be a little more understanding..these things are not even half of what i deal with in one day!!|`|a1uoxczTaa	My boyfriend and I are not in a stressful situation but I can see that he has changed a little. This is our first and I am just a little over 7 weeks along. So not far. He seems to be a little more gentle, I am getting sick so he has kinda been taking care of things. But I also notice that when we argue he isn't as nice as before. Before he would kinda brush it off, maybe make a joke. Now he yells right back at me or will get mean and maybe say hurtful things. So i think the guys change a little also, I am more relaxed about things while he kinda is the one worrying about money and all that.|`|F2BkCGXHaa	when i was pregnant i definently felt under appreciated. I serve my bf hand and foot and now my son is 2 weeks old and my bf is finally starting to ease up. granted i dont have a job so we stress about money but when he gets home, he acts like i did nothing around the house to help out. even though i clean, do laundry, cook , serve his every need. but things are slowly getting better.|`|I0bcQ9hRaa	I'm 15 weeks pregnant on wednesday...  My boyfriend became 'stressed' and moved back in with his mum...  I feel for you, the realisation of any man becoming a dad just scares them...  Don't worry though, work through it and think of your baby...  You can never go wrong that way.|`|mEjKZXipaa	Pregnancy hormones can do crazy things to you. Maybe things that don't normally annoy you are annoying you now because of hormones. Just a consideration. He may seem overly irritating right now, but you could just be extra sensitive too.|`|XbFEFJsgaa	have you ever thought maybe its not your husband?|`|GIDK8kbBaa	yes|`|DIFDYxCWaa	My husband is very attentive, and we talk through any stress he his having from work or his crazy mom. Whenever I notice he is stressed I have him take a bubble bath or shower before he sits dow to relax. I also encourage scriptures, quotes, or reflecting on all the wonderful things going on vs. dwelling on issues we can't control right now. We have pillow talk every night and I always say tell me whatever is on your mind, even if it's "my big toe hurts." We all have stresses in our lives, but is so important not to let them interfere with our vows, and the peace in our homes.|`|6PhSENcXaa	I'm Chris's wife and I'm 49 now, when we had our children (8) Chris was great!  He worked 12 hour days 6 days a week but when he got home he would help cook meals and clean up after.  He would do the vacuuming and dusting, landry what ever needed to be done he did.  And with our first child we were building a new home and when I was 8 months pregnant we were moving.  Chris had me stay at my parents home for the weekend and he did all the moving and putting things away where they belong.  I never had to do anything at all and he was just as calm and cool as could be.  He never ever once got angry, snappy or mad at any time during my 8 different pregnancies.<br>  So I was lucky to have him here to help.  Heck he actually would tell me to stay in bed at night when any of the kids would wake up.  Now remember he was working 12 hour days so he wasn't getting much sleep what so ever.  In the 31 years he worked for this company he never missed a day.  He had vacation time for when I was ready to deliver and he'd spend 2 weeks at home with me and the baby.<br>  <br>  Chris is a great man, father and husband, I could never find anyone to replace him.|`|RzYePezkaa	My husband is very stressed this is my 3rd baby but his 2nd my first is from a previous marriage we are also planning to actually be married now that we have the money do a decent ceremony in june so he is extremely stressed but all expectant dads are cranky and nervous give him time he will be okay when baby gets here but hopefully before then.
796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	I would be very happy with this report card! Obviously the child is very smart and putting effort into her school work and that really matters. Everyone has a subject that is harder for them even if the rest are easy, so you really can't get too upset.    I think you should praise her for all her A's and just encourage her in a positive way to keep pushing at the Chemistry. From what you said, she's really trying and is probably upset with her grade, but she should be proud of the rest of the grades. No one is perfect and sometimes a certain class will just beat you no matter what you do. Math was usually the subject for me that I had to push in, the rest were easy A's.     Your daughter has almost straight A's as well as several honors so you should be one proud Mom! Chemistry just isn't her best subject and that's OK. Just work with her to find a way to help in that class.    Give her a big hug and even bigger congratulations! We have to remember not to let one not so good grade overshadow the great ones.     Brit|`|cAtWxJG1aa	were the grades pulled up from previously struggling? was the c gotten with great effort in a hard class, or because my child blew off the class and didn't turn in homework? how i'd feel about it would depend less on the grades on their face and more on what kind of effort they represented.      *eta -- in that case, i'd tell her i was proud of her and hope she was proud of herself.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I'd be thrilled....I'd wonder if the c was because of laziness or difficulty in understanding and go from there.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	id be happy and exicted for him/her|`|k9VvIG3gaa	GREAT!!  A C doesn't bug me..because its actually average..|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	I would be proud of my daughter and happy for her successes. It sounds like chem is a big challenge at her school, and for her, but she's working as hard as she can and not giving up.    I would support her and focus on helping her to grow into a strong and capable young woman.|`|oXrDKjkkaa	AWESOME card!!!  All those A's!  And a C in Chem - a very hard subject?!  Chemistry was my most difficult class; I did try very hard, got in a study group, tried asking questions in class til the teacher called me a retard - I was very, very depressed about my low grade and felt like an idiot.  Why did I even have to take that class?  Unless your child is a genius and could have easily gotten an A in chem, you should be CELEBRATING!!!|`|AA11193401	proud|`|RmZ54Shvaa	verrry excited|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	I would take her to go and get her nails done and maybe buy her an outfit she wanted and that following weekend expand her curfew by an hour or so|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Excellent! I'd be very happy with her.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i would give my kid 100$ for that good of a card?|`|2pxiK9waaa	I'd be thrilled with all the grades except Chemistry and I'd get her a tutor if she felt she needed one when the other steps hadn't been working. I'd also talk to the teacher and see what you can do at home to help her be successful in chem.|`|nqcnylFpaa	whats wrong with that i got my sons report card today     math-A  science-B  gym-A  history-A  wood shop-B  language arts-A|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Those are excellent grades.  That's really good to get A's in all of your honors classes.  Chemistry is a really difficult class for a lot of people, so I wouldn't be upset about the C unless they slacked off and didn't do their work.  But judging from this person's other grades, that doesn't seem to be the case.  A C is fine as long as you put in all of your effort.|`|HMF4BXbNaa	id be pissed about the C but since the rest are As I would still be proud.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Are you worried about it?  Of course any parent would be proud...not really just because of the grades...but because it clearly shows the student has been trying their  best....that is clear because the chemistry mark is so much lower....obviously not thier best subject.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I would be very proud. My step son had:    English B  Auto tech C-  Math D  Basic Design C-    He is now grounded!!|`|KmoluAWFaa	I'd be thrilled. Getting a C is nothing to be ashamed of, espically with everything else being A's.     Keep up the good work!|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I would be very proud.    I would hope the child would strive for A and B but a C isn't the end of the world    I do have a problem with Ds and Fs|`|AA11222790	They deserve a pat on the back. Chemistry is a hard subject.  Getting a C is not the best, yet it isn't the worst either.  Hopefully she can improve...give her some incentive to try harder or maybe you can help her understand the subject better.  That is if you know Chemistry.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	my kids are usually straight a's and 1-2 b's per report card. if any of them would have came home with this kind of report card, i would have taken them out to eat, their choice. then i would have talked to them about what they think needs to be done to try to get a little higher on the chemistry. i would be proud no matter what. i would only worry, if they had gotten a's and then 2-3 report cards with c's on them. from my point of view, they are having a hard time with the lower grade-not becuase they didn't try, and that is what matters to me,|`|1a837cf5274e28b6f67b09c94f14b623aa	I'd be happy for my child, if she would have gotten a C in Chemistry but was trying her best I would know that she have tried and that is all I can ask of her.|`|Bi7esswoaa	Be very excited!  Part of the beauty that we were all created differently is that not everyone is a Scientist or a Chemist.  If your child is doing well in all other areas except Chemistry, you might consider encouraging him/her through the requirement and next year focus on something that really interests Him/Her.   But still congratulate your kidthats great work!|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I'd be estatic, especially if s/he was going to the same high school I did (in which the curriculum was painful!).    Chemistry is rough on nearly everyone, and the fact that s/he is passing the class deserves an award!    Congrats to your child, by the way.|`|Hymc2MAeaa	Thats amazing.  When I did my best I got straight A's and 1 'C' - Math  I would be very proud.  As for the test you can have her talk to the teacher they have little tips and tricks for those kind of things but again that is very good.|`|cteyFJxhaa	OMG that happened to my son!  I just told him that Chemistry was a bad choice of science for him.  Obviously she's a bright girl but every kid has a tough subject.  If she still needs another science to graduate maybe she should try biology.    Good luck|`|gDEFlWnOaa	That is a wonderful report card! What is there to be angry about?|`|410a835f4cda7b7745e73951c247513aaa	I would be sure she knows how extremely proud I am of her and then I would ask her if there is anything else she would like to do in an attempt to retain her chemistry lessons better.    I would also look into Sylvan Learning Centers or additional resources outside of the school setting for extra tutoring.
DYz5FaVVaa	I believe a mild fever is normal, but you cannot take Advil. You can take Tylenol.  Check WebMD for a list of common symptoms and acceptable medications.|`|dbyLDPwmaa	Usually i would take tylenol because i heard its bad to drink advil but i dont know if it harms the baby|`|eV5E9MhUaa	No... take tylenol. Call your OB if it stays. If it's super high, you should go ahead and call now.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	No, you can never use Advil during pregnancy.  Plain Tylenol will safely bring down your fever though.|`|AA10038269	take tylenol but i would ask your dr first he /she can tell you|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	take tylenol, and if it is really high or doesnt go down, call your dr or go to er.
PR42HDjraa	Why did you have unprotected sex?|`|256cVXsmaa	You might be stressing yourself out making yourself feel all these symptoms because it is far to early to be experiencing all of those. A lot of them can be due to you starting your period soon.  I would def. wait to take the test after you miss you period because if you took it now it wouldn't be accurate.  Wait 2 weeks and take it.|`|01vMpHkWaa	the egg takes 2 weeks to implant  ....you wouldnt even be showing symptoms now|`|buoqtZeFaa	It's best to wait to see if you miss a period|`|mxixfE3Raa	You could be pregnant, but it's too early to tell. You can't take a test until you have missed your period.|`|DBdR26Ssaa	well first you could be pregnant from the unprotected sex. but you wouldnt be experiencing symptoms yet. you are probably just about to start your period. and second, if you think you are ready to act like an adult, by having sex, you better be ready to be a parent, because it could happen no matter how careful you are, and it sounds like you arent being very careful..|`|J2glFOkhaa	First things first. Get to a doctor, or a free clinic if you're afraid to tell your parents since you KNOW you shouldn't be having sex... and get a full STD work up. They can test you for everything, unprotected sex and 'pulling out" is absolutely ridiculouly dangerous. You could have caught any number of STDs from this person.    And what if you are pregnant? You're 14, what could you possibly offer this child? Or were you planning to abort if you were. Why not huh? You're not ready for a kid, why not kill it    You kids make me SICK to my stomach|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	you could be pregnant, but if you are it would probably be too soon to be experiencing all those symptoms. wait until you are a few days late to test to get an accurate result. try not to stress since stress can delay your period.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It's too soon for you to be having symptoms.  You can test after you miss your period.  However, I didn't get a positive test until I was 5 days late.  If you aren't pregnant I hope you learned from this scare and NEVER have unprotected sex again until you want a baby.  Also, since you didn't use a condom you need to go get tested for STD's.|`|R1zUIh7taa	It is probably best if you speak to your parents and get them to explain how pregnancy works.  If you happen to be pregnant, you won't know right away, expect to wait 4-6 weeks to find out!  And a boy/ man may pull out of you and it means nothing at all he can still get you pregnant as soon as you start having sex.  It sounds to me like you either have an STD or the flu and you are starting to get regular bowl movements!  Also all the things you listed as symptoms could all be period related.|`|jORTexg7aa	Wow, Fourteen and having sex, Not just sex but unprotected sex..Nice.  Well dear, It's to early to tell, Your probably just sick.  Do you have a temperature?  Make some soup, Take some ibuprofen and lay down.  If your period doesn't come, Take the test.  Good luck.
fk9AvB25aa	Wait another week then take a pregnancy test. If you take one too early you may not get accurate results. But since it sounds like you may have some pregnancy symptoms then a home pregnancy test may give you a result one way or the other. If it's positive you may want to get a doctor to confirm it.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	You really need to take a home pregnancy test dear.  =)  That's the best way to find out of course.  Best of luck to you!|`|lhn1wNoeaa	take a HPT|`|HDznnh39aa	Keep your pants on! If theres a big ol bubble on you and you dont drink beer, my best guess would be a baby. maybe.|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	you could be pregnant. just take a test and find out.|`|0KGriIC7aa	since about the 25th of jan my breasts started hurting i have felt sick and have been cramping i am not due for my period till feb 9th   my hubby and i are ttc. i can not take a preg test till at least feb 7th   this will be  my third baby   each time i have had the symptoms very early on when everybody thought i was crazy.   we can keep our fingers crossed together .
330704520aa0bd3e60df442e437848e4aa	You need a low glycemic diet and metformin.     PCOS is a condition that causes you to be insulin resistant.  With metformin and a strict low glycemic diet you should see a return of your fertility within 6 months.  More than likely your FSH & LH ratio is flipped.  So low glycemic and metformin are the best ways I have seen PSOC cured!!  Seek a dr. who wants to cure your gynecological issue.    I hope that you seek treatment for your condition.  A fertility clinic will just force your body to do what it is not doing naturally.  Try to fix the problem to restore your fertility.|`|fYMWDQLGaa	Hi    I too have PCOS, but for past 6 months I am taking birth control pills... and from that on my periods are regular, i didnt get any chin hairs. from nexxt month on, I am TTC. if you want your periods to be regular, its good to have oysters which is a very good food for these problems, in-take more nuts, spinach,apple,milk,yogurt.. if you want to get conceived immed, consult ur doc, they might give u meds like clomid which will induce ovulation..    Goodluck|`|TqPtbwhraa	Hi I Know what you are going through.  I also have PCOS it really sucks.  The extra hair I also am plucking like crazy and I was on the pill for six months and now I am off of it cause I would like to have a baby.  The problem is now I am not getting my period again.  I am suppose to see my fertility doctor next week to discuss my options.  I have never been on any type of meds except for the pill.  I am also frustrated and I don't know what to do.  I Hope you get an answer for your question.
lhn1wNoeaa	It's too early to know the symptoms. If you have tried in your ovulation and most fertile days then you have chances of being pregnant and you should wait till you missed your period.Lots of baby dust on your way.  The bleeding may be implantation bleeding.
RBxDWMjaaa	Hi,  Oh that is so great!    Congratulations!    Your going to be a great big sister I'm sure!    Just be ready to help your mom out.  She is going to have her hands full so just be sure to not act all moody teen like for a while! lol... If you know what i mean!    Just be ready to help however you can!    Maybe clean up the house some and get their room ready.      Hope I Helped!|`|MCeh0uIaaa	Awwww! that's sooo exciting! my mom had a baby a year ago and I remember how hard it was to get through the school day knowing my sister was being born! it would be nice of you to make some meals that can be put away in the freezer or fridge that way mom can take them out and just heat them up for dinner. she is going to be very busy with a new baby in the house :) btw the baby isnt very fun at first...just does alot of sleeping. my sister will 1 on march 1st (leap year babe) and she is much more fun now and getting more fun every day :) good luck and congrats!|`|90nnM99Paa	i'm so excited for you!! I wish I had younger siblings, i'm the youngest! you sound like you'll be a great older sister. I'm sure the house is already pretty tidy, waiting for her to come home, but if not clean everything up, make your moms bed, etc. Just be ready to help her out, there's two of them :]    congrats again!    edit: oh, also, i'd say make a pasta or something like that, anything that's easy to heat up, so that you can have it for a night or two so you don't have to cook :]|`|AA11981363	YAY!! congratulations to your family, what a wonderful blessing!    I would help around, have the house clean, dishes/laundry done, nursery in order etc so your mom can get home to rest and not to do stuff. Are you old enough to cook? if so, cook her something, be there for her, and help her out lots, you sound like you are gonna be a great big sister.    Good luck|`|JXqTKpxNaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!    prepare for their arrival, you know dust their rooms, etc.|`|ZKm894kfaa	Congrats on your new sisters! Well just try to help you mom out by cleaning up the house, doing the dishes, and if you know how to cook maybe cook dinner for her.  Help her by changing diapers, and as for the babies...Just love them unconditionally.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Wow, congrats!  I love their names.  I would make sure that the nursery is all set up and everything is available (diapers, wipes, blankets, etc.).  When your mom gets home, ask her if she would like you to put the girls to bed or help with feedings, if possible.  I would be more concerned about what you could do for your mom.    Congrats again!|`|F4FJVq37aa	Aww Congrats! That's soo exciting! That's pretty neat they were born on different days! The most helpful thing you can do is help your mom do anything she asks and some things she doesn't. She is going to be very tired and she will have quite a handful. Help her with as much as the house chores as you can, she will be SO grateful. With the baby's, just hold and cuddle them!|`|hGY08GjRaa	Congrats!! How exciting.    Just try to be a big help for mom. One new baby is a handful.. two are... well.. she can use all the help you can give her. And as you do that, your little sisters will bond to you in a special way.     Ways you can help mom  Change diapers  Help with feedings (if she's using formula at all)  Keep babies entertained when they are fussy but mom can't pick one/both of them up right then  Cook  Do laundry  clean.  babysit so mom can take a couple hours to herself to go to the store without the babies, or out to eat with dad, or SOMETHING!     Congrats again! I'm sure you'll enjoy!!|`|B7NPXRoqaa	Aw congrats! Ah I'm remembering when my brother was born. Now he's turning one! It'll be great, but your mom will definitely count on you a lot. I babysit for 5 minutes, at least, every day, if she needs to run an errand or take a shower or something. Remember that it will be weird for the first couple of days, because you probably won't be able to touch them that much (they sleep a ton, and when their not sleeping they are eating or getting a diaper change). I remember asking constantly if I could hold him.     Anyway, to answer your question, put up banners and stuff! No loud things, like music or kazoos (spelling?). Wash their clothes (with a no fragrance detergent) and their blankets so it doesn't irritate their skin. get everything ready for your parents. You want them to be in the easiest state ever (or else they will be super cranky!)|`|hstwNjNaaa	Yay, babies!    Those are such nice names!    Have the house clean and tidy, so your parents don't have to worry about stuff like that. Maybe get them each a little toy, so that you can give them something special that they can have in their cot's (make sure it's not a choking hazard or anything) to sleep with on their first night home.|`|a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	Thats great! congrats. I wish the best for you and your family!
AA11755924	I have three kids.  8 yr old, 4 yr old and a 3 yr old.  They are a handful!  I feel like I am ALWAYS saying "NO" or "Stop that!" or "stay out of those!"    I have turned into my mother.  "We just can't have nice things!"  It is true...    I spend most of my spare time either touching up the paint on the walls and covering over markers, crayons, etc., or doing laundry with chewed up gum in the pockets, or melted chocolate.      My couch and love seat is usually used as a trampolean. I also pull little boxes of raisins out of the VCR, or feel sad b/c my 3 yr old daughter keeps getting into my expensive make up and decides to mop the floor with it, or dig her little fingers in it.      Don't forget cleaning up broken glass off the floor from someone dropping a glass or bowl.    But I have to say, it's all worth it.  I also get giggles under the covers each night, unlimited hugs and kisses.  I get to feel like God because I can fetch a frisbie off a roof or the neighbors back yard.      I get to hear, "You're great, mom" when I comb my son's hair every day.  And play games at night when I put them to bed.    Sigh...I love it.|`|QDcirmsgaa	I think the transition from 1 to 2 is much easier than having no children, to one. You know what to expect, and you've been through it, so in a way, it IS easier. I was terrified when I was pregnant with my second daughter. I thought my first (also a girl) would be jealous, regress on potty training (though at the time her sister was born, she'd been potty trained almost a year), and generally become an awful child. That's what I'd heard from the "horror" stories of parents galore.     But, I was pleasantly surprised. I include my older daughter in as much as I can, with her little sister. They adore each other - it's so cute. She always insists she needs to give her little sister hugs and kisses, especially before she goes to preschool. I included her in as much as possible while I was pregnant, too. I intended to breastfeed (and I am!), so I would show her books, tell her about how a body makes milk, etc.     Right after my youngest was born, as soon as I felt alright to walk, we'd walk to the park. It made my older daughter feel like she was still my "baby" because, as I said before, she was included.     It's all about making them feel important, too.  :) Even if you're scared that there's not enough love to go around, there really is! Your heart and mind just grow the extra love, it seems.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i never thought it was. and i have 3. with 1 stepson. mine are 12,8 & 3 months. my stepson is 13. i still feel the same. the only thing that i actually felt the change in is freedom. it was a little harder, and more expensive to find a sitter for more than one. but i don't need one any more becuase of my oldest 2 so i don't even worry about that.   people say that it is so much more expensive. i never really understood that, it isn't like you have to drop 20,000 dollars in one day. you take it day by day, and i love to watch my children together. it gives me a peace like no other to see that i have given my kids the gift of siblings. there is no other closeness like sisters & brothers, and their never will be.|`|VCCKfT3taa	I think the biggest challenge really is not that there are more kids in the house, it's the ages of the kids.     If you have your second when your first is still a toddler, then you have a VERY demanding toddler and a VERY VERY demanding newborn tugging at your 24/7. Till your second grows up a little more, the first year or two will seem harder than it was with your first, since you have to divide your attention.     But generally, I've heard nothing but good stories from mothers of more than one kid. The first has a sibling to play with, they both benefit from the social interaction, mom gets to try for the OTHER sex if she wanted a boy or girl and didn't get it the first time.. lol. ^_^    Don't let people scare you, remember; it all gets better when they turn 18.     Oh wait.. no it doesn't... XD|`|UUpsa35Daa	It takes adjustment. There's not a guarantee that it will be hard or that it will be easy. But you will have an adjustment period where things will seem hard and really chaotic. But then you'll get into a schedule and routine and things will jut seem second nature to you.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I actually found that going from none to one was harder than one to two.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Going from number 1 to number 2  IS the hardest,.but still not that hard.   Really, you'll look back and say, "That wasn't that hard".|`|AA11327039	It's extremely difficult go from zero kids to one and almost as hard to go from one to two, but from two to three is the easiest and even easier from then on out.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I have 6..having one child alone is the hardest|`|oXrDKjkkaa	Oh, it's much easier!  Now your first-born has a sibling to be friends with, to play with, to learn cooperation with. The older one can be a great help with the little one, which is good for him. Sure, there are fights and differences of opinion, but it really is fun and well worth it.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I have 3 but i adopted two when they were 5 lol.  I cant imagine hvaing 3 close in age and all babies, but honestly as kids its really great and they all help out.  I actually think i want more lol.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Yes it is harder. The good news is that if you have more than one child ou will survive the extra load!!! If you are maried does your husband help and want to continue helping?? If yes then your life will be much less stressful than a single mom.Good luck!!!|`|myEwHgI1aa	Don't freak out! As a family grows, you learn to live with each other. It is an adjustment, but it isn't all that bad. I have one adopted son, one birth son, and waiting to give birth to baby  2. ( 3 kids in all) I think it is normal as a mother to wonder if you can keep up with all their needs, but lots of moms have done it, with even more kids!|`|VLr3jrutaa	it is when they are young obviously cause there is twice as much to do. but when they get older they can amuse each other and play with each other giving you more time to yourself so to speak cause you don't have to be there play mate all the time (unless you want to of course)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	2 was definaltely much much harder than one but I think having my third was the easiest for me. I knew what I was doing and didnt stress at all. Of course financially its harder but for me one was scary, 2 I was freaked out and out of my mind because it was much more difficult than I thought but number 3 is really just 'one more to carry around' :)  for me and for many people with 3 or more kids|`|kZRTekoJaa	naturally it's an adjustment and it depends on the age of  1 when  2 is born, and how much help you have.  my daughter was born 6 weeks before my son was 2. thankfully he was very patient with me and didn't get too upset by me constantly telling him to "hold on" while i did something for his sister. now that she is older, two kids is as easy as one was.  however, i did decide i would wait til my daughter was a little older before trying to have more b/c pregnancy sucked for me both times and i feel like i missed out on a lot with my son b/c i was sick, miserable, or simply not capable of doing some things, not to mention all the things that i didn't feel like doing while taking care of a newborn.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Then they aren't very good parents are they?|`|8oAlBL91aa	I always hear that having 2 kids is easier than having only one because then they have someone to play with.|`|6ea856e3826885a5e91b108d3f52cd32aa	I am currently pregnant with  2 and scared out of mind because of the same thing!!!   I can let you know in May...LOL|`|GY12Mnjmaa	hey Dude what are you doing
G2auAv1Saa	I didn't wait until marriage, but I did wait for my husband.   I think girls these days equate having sex with getting love.   Many don't see it as demoralizing because they are getting attention and 'love'. They don't realize they can do other things they can do for  attention worth getting and real love.   I think we see sex everywhere and are so inundated with it that it isn't a big deal anymore. There is nothing to hide.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I think they should wait until they are ready to accept the possibility of becoming a parent. I started having sex at 18 and got married at 24, I had my son at 27. My husband is still the only man I have ever been with, he was my first and only. It's an incorrect assumption that everyone that has sex before marriage is sleeping around.|`|AA10186411	Even though I didn't, I believe in waiting for marriage.  I was young and stupid.  I wish now that I had, because I was in no way ready for the emotional ramification of sex.  I hope I can pass that on to my daughter, and she will make better choices than I did.|`|G02vO6Jwaa	i think it is demoralizing. but, i also think that it's people's decision weather they want to wait til marriage or not. i personally don't want to wait. i can, but i just don't want to. its my choice, i don't regret it, and i'm smart about it. i don't see a problem in that.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I will probably get the thumbs down for this but it seems to me since the PLAN B pill came out it is giving people another reason to be careless.  Before it was you could get an std and be pregnant.  Now the only worry is STDs and it seems like people will look at someone and assume that they do not have an STD because they are clean looking or have had a recent test.  Obviously even the cleanest person can have one but I think the fear of pregnancy was worse.  Also the fear of abortion was there as well.  No one is excited about getting an abortion and it put fear into a lot of girls.  The pill took that part away.|`|OaMN1M4yaa	Im not sure why some young girls are having sex, some of the questions on here about 13 and 14 y/o saying I think I might be pregnant make me roll my eyes. but saying that I started having sex at the age of 15 I was on the pill and we used condoms everytime. I don't regret it one bit because I felt this person was the right person to be sexually active with and I was right we got married last October and we are expecting our first baby this August. So as for saving your self for marriage i believe its a personal choice, my advice would be just make sure you are ready to accept the consequences and that its the right person.|`|VT24zOomaa	humm, well i didn't save myself for marriage, but i waited till i found the right guy. i was with my boyfriend for a year before we had sex, very protected sex. and i'm still with him today, 2 years later. so i'm been with the same guy for 3 years, and he's the only person i've had sex with.    i think girls think it's normal and okay to do, so they just do it. i personally had very high standards for myself. i've always felt that i wanted to have sex with only 1 man my whole life.    Now were having our first baby and i'm thrilled!  were not into the whole marriage thing, not very important to us.|`|94Q77fIfaa	Well I am a 17 year old mother with a wonderful baby girl    and i think we are having sex so young because its everyones    own choice to have sex    and i was having proctected sex until i decided i wanted a child|`|1iOsKZvIaa	i probably will. But I'm scared my future husband will find it weird.....|`|T71SAa1Baa	They do it because they're stupid.|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	Because we don't live in the 1950's anymore.. it's socially acceptable to have a baby young nowadays. Girls generally aren't made to feel disgusting for being a teen mum. (that being said, some women on here ensure teen mums feel disgusting).  And no, I don't think we should save ourselves for marriage, sleeping AROUND is demoralizing, but just because you have had sex before marriage doesn't make you a slut.   I went to a Catholic school and had no sex education we were taught how to time our periods so that we only had sex when we weren't ovulating - so I blame a lack of education to be honest.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I think by the time most women can really appreciate sex for what it is they have already lost their virginity. A lot of other girls just don't seem to care who they sleep with making it harder for a girl to hold on to a serious relationship if she's not willing to sleep with her man ( and not risk him cheating anyway). So many girls think they can have sex with a guy and steal him away from his girlfriend (which doesn't really work), and the girlfriends know that girls do this so they do what they can to prevent the guy from having sex with other girls (or at least try to). Although the ideal is for us all to wait until marriage i don't look down on those who don't. I find it sad that people don't respect their body enoughto not share it with nnumerous others.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Sleeping around is demoralizing. Not every young teen/woman sleeps around. I'm 18, 19 in one month. I'm expecting my first baby in May.  I've only been with ONE guy, the father. Let me mention, I wasn't a minor when I began having sex. I didn't just turn 18 and say, I'm an adult now, I'm gonna go have sex!    I had known my boyfriend since 2006, dated him since 2007. He didn't pressure me into anything. It was my choice. He was raised to respect women.      When the time came, I knew I loved him. I knew I wanted him to be my first( and only lol). We have talked of marriage and do have plans to marry.    When you have sex with someone you love its way different then 'sleeping around".    We were smart, we used protection. No birth control method, but abstinence, is 100% pregnancy proof. We both knew this and we both accept the consquences of the pregnancy. We don't view it as an accident because we both knew what we were doing,even with the birth control methods, nothing was 100% fool proof.    Am I sorry for not waiting till I'm married before I had sex? No. My 1st was special. I wasn't rushed or pressured. It wasn't like they sterotype on tv: teen sex in the back seat of a car.    He's the man I'm planning on marrying. We have a good, solid relationship before the sex and we still do have a great relationship.     While its romantic about saving yourself for your husband, does anyone not know that the honeymoon would be painful at first because of the virginity thing?     I don't feel like I let my god down by not saving myself for the "marriage bed".  He's my love of my life and what we share is special.    We don't live with our parents. We live together. We pay our own bills. We have our own apartment and car. We are not living off ANYONE.     I don't care what other people think.  You don't have to be married to love someone. You don't have to be married to have children. It's 2009, not 1950s and centuries before!    So sleeping around is way different from having sex/making love with the man/women you love.|`|QtyRuxJnaa	honestly, i dont know. i think they should just wait to have sex. and if they have sex at all, they should at least be protected, unless they want to get pregnant, which i doubt. guys r just as bad as girls, but the guys dont necessarily kno whether the girl is on a pill, so they should always have protection. or the girl should let the guy kno whether they r on the pill or ne other type of protection. i think its irresponsible. personally, im against abortion, so hopefully if teens get pregnant, they put it up for adoption. i think they should wait to have any sexual relationships. theyve waited for more than ten years, im sure they can wait longer. i mean, yea the hormones r bad, but still, they can wait. and they Should wait.|`|fPAlfokHaa	I think that sleeping around is demoralizing but why single out young women what about young men who sleep around?  Its not the 1950's, we don't have to all be married before having sex or getting pregnant. Fair enough, you should be mature enough to deal with the consequences of what you are doing before having sex, but if you are in a loving relationship and taking the necessary precautions whats the big deal? It's a personal choice and not one everyone has to agree with.|`|6qdPyP7eaa	Although I believe in the institution of marriage, I do not believe that one needs to be married to be a wonderful mother and father.     Many people are terrible parents, regardless of a piece of paper and (most times) over the top expense.    My partner and I are engaged and have been for 2 years. We also have a 21mth old son and a baby girl on the way. We are constantly being praised by family and strangers for our sons exceptional behaviour, compassion and general happy and good nature.    Yes..one day we will get married but until then my partner and I will continue to provide a loving and caring home and family life for both our children, instilling values, love and compassion in both of them, that will let them grow into wonderful parents themselves.
b10aMPdOaa	He's just probably tired and not said anything just in case he upsets you.  But having a mood on him, will upset you anyway.  He probably doesn't know how to confront you.  Speak with him, explain that you didn't mean to keep him awake, but also point out, that when baby is here and wakes up during the night you would not want him to have a mood on the next morning.  This is now part of life for you both.  Good luck|`|oOqSpBmbaa	I don't know. Ask him|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	He's probably tired.  To be fair, you shouldn't have held him to you for the entire night.|`|AA11981363	I say typical men behavior, sometimes they just get anxious about the whole baby idea, even if they are ok with it, but the reponsibility and what it means to be a parent can be overwhelming sometimes. Ask him what's wrong, communicate with him, men won't word out stuff til we ask, they are hard to open up about these things.    I wish you the best.|`|UiXJLrDWaa	he just probably tire.|`|nxHztcslaa	how typical is this!! We have to put up with this every night and day of our pregnancies..this is the reason men do not give birth haha!    don't worry about it, hes just a man.. just try laugh it off and remind him that you have to endure this without choice..|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	people do get in moods if they dont get a good nights sleep. Apologise and make sure you are both equally comfortable tonight.|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Just explain to him that perhaps tonight, he can cuddle you from behind.  this way the baby won't keep him up.  Keep in mind as well that if this is his first child, he is probably going through some emotions as well.  Men get scared just like we do. Talk to him, or ask him if there is anything he wants to talk about.  Don't get upset if he tells you he is afraid.  Just tell him you understand and you'll work it out together.|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Aaw, sweetie, dont worry.. as you say he might just be tired! You yourself are very hormonal at the moment, and might have taken it the wrong way, as you used to the routine! But please dont let i get to you.. they're men at the end of the day.. these little things that can mean so much to us girlies.. maybe don't mean anything to them!  Just keep smiling - You got a lil bubba on the way! =)    xx
kZRTekoJaa	it depends on your DR but basically paperwork, a lot of background health questions (you and your spouses, and family), blood work, and maybe a vaginal exam and ultrasound.  it really depends on where you go. however, this will most likely be your most time consuming appointment if you have an uncomplicated pregnancy and will probably take quite a while. (the first appt for my second pregnancy was 3 hours long, but it was a different DR then i went to for my first pregnancy)|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well, congrats!    At my first appt, I met with a nurse for family history, etc...bring hubby b.c his history is needed too. They will project your due date based on your lmp.  Then the first exam was really like a normal annual at the OBGYN...pap test, breast exam, etc.  They have you pee in a cup to check for protein and sugar...check your weight and blood pressure.    I also got to get an ultrasound!!  I was about 8-9 weeks when I had my 1st appt, if you are not that far along, they may schedule the u/s for later.    Also, if your dr doesn't have you get a blood test and urine test for pregnancy before the appt...you will have it done at the office or they will give you the script to take it to a lab.  baby dust!|`|UdBfaZdYaa	Depending on where you will be going to the doctor... but, they asked me questions about mine, and my boyfriends health, and genetics. They also took my blood, and took my heart rate. It's mostly about filling out paper work, and answering questions the first time in there. I was also nervous about this. It gets exciting! Good Luck & Congratulations!|`|AA10015577	You should go in a little earlier to fill out all the lovely paperwork.  You will then have to pee in a cup, get weighed, blood pressure checked, pap smear, fundal height measurement, have everything checked to make sure your measuring correctly, and a lab for blood work to be done (or they will do it that day).  Don't expect an ultrasound at the first appoinment (depending on gestation) unless you aren't measuring correctly or something seems abnormal.  The routine ultrasound is usually made for 20 weeks.  Be sure to ask the doc any questions you may have!  HTH!  Good luck!
E2UXN7J1aa	That is very deceitful! I personally could never be so conniving. She should tell him and if she doesn't want the baby then give him the option to take it and give up her rights. He is the father. He has the right to know that he has a child somewhere out there.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Wow, what a heartless woman. She is being totally selfish and is not thinking about the baby. What I want to know is if they just grew apart, why does she have this hate in her to where she would go as far as give the baby up for adoption and not tell him.   If it were me, I would want the child and would share custody with the father.|`|htSZsds7aa	The father must know...he may want to reconsile or raise the baby himself. I would find a way to tell him|`|FIALhwlKaa	If it really would be me, there wouldnt be a question. I would keep the baby and tell the father also. If I had a life, where I couldnt give the baby a healthy surrounding, I would talk to the father and ask if he would like to keep it or help me.|`|yMfJNatnaa	I would find a way to tell him....Thats just so wrong he is entitled to know.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	he has a right to know he is going to be a father and he must be told as what she is doing is wrong she may hate him but that doesn't mean the  baby she is carrying should be denied the right to know its father it didn't ask to be born he needs to know
52bAHCaUaa	You can always call your doctor and tell them your concerns, and ask to get in sooner.    Scoliosis is usually caught much earlier if it is something to be concerned about. My sister has scoliosis, they have known since she was 4. She had to wear a brace for about 5 years, and now she has a surgery every 6 months. Her curve is usually around 45, but has been at 60.     Also, being that you are older, you will have a better understanding as to what your back should look like, and does look like with a 20 degree curve. So what it, you'll know if something is off. And call and make an appointment as soon as you feel your back get any worse.    Hope I helped...|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It won't.  When they said your bones "matured" what they meant is you won't be growing much more and your stature is complete.  Kids who have scoliosis only wear a brace until their bones stop growing, for a girl this is shortly after she begins her period.  After that the brace is no longer needed.  If your bones do continue to curve, it won't happen suddenly and they'd have plenty of time to treat it with surgery.    Why didn't you ask the doctor when you were in the office?  That is certainly the best place to get info.|`|iKxm8aL7aa	If you have a 20 degree curve it is not considerably relatively bent,but rather uncomfortable for you...And yes if you have twenty years your bones are fused together and you should find other solutions.|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	Treatment is based on the severity of the curve and the chances of the curve getting worse (if you're still growing you have a higher likelihood of it worsening). There are three main categories of treatment: observation, bracing, and surgery.      Curves     In most cases, scoliosis is not painful. Be sure to see a spine surgeon to rule out other causes of back pain, which your doctor will want to look for as well.     Strengthening your core muscles can help with back pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, massage, exercises, and yoga can help with pain relief.|`|8WYWEDOpaa	You do have scoliosis.  That's not open for debate.  You have a mild case, though.    You've got a lot going for you.  If you're just about done growing, your curve won't be increasing much, if at all.  It is true that if your curve is greater than 30 degrees (a figure my surgeon told me; another lady here says greater than 40 degrees) when you're done growing, your curve will continue to increase.  But, you're not even near 30 (or 40) degrees.    Secondly, curves don't increase quickly.  This is why scoliosis surgery is never an emergency.  You can see it coming, usually from years away.  So if you're about done growing and you're at 20 degrees, your curve will most likely become stable and stay where it is.    Waiting a year for your next checkup is reasonable.|`|KjkH4MYLaa	Don't worry your curve is considered a moderate curve but not life threatning in no sense , since your 16 and you have finished the majority of your growth then your curve will very unlikely change to what's considered drastic . If your worried about observation then ask for a 6 monthly check up . Im 15 years old , female , i have considered a "major" curves they are 40 thoraic and 50 lumber . Causes me lots of pain and don't worry the curve increased so much because i grew around 6 inches in 1.5-2 years and i also have a condition called hypermobility (common cause of scoliosis) . Im having spinal fusion to correct it in summer this year .    Good Luck  You will be fine , don't worry    xxx
SRIaRm08aa	Yes there is a higher risk of a teenage mother dying but there can also be more complications both to the mother and the baby in general.  Most young girls have the risk of having a preterm baby.  This risk is also for women in their late 30s and higher.    Back to TopPossible Complications  Adolescent pregnancy is associated with higher rates of illness and death for both the mother and infant.    Pregnant teens are at much higher risk of dying or having serious medical complications such as:    Placenta previa   Pregnancy-induced hypertension   Premature delivery   Significant anemia   Toxemia   Infants born to teens are 2 - 6 times more likely to have low birth weight than those born to mothers age 20 or older. Prematurity plays the greatest role in low birth weight, but intrauterine growth retardation (inadequate growth of the fetus during pregnancy) is also a factor.    Teen mothers are more likely to have unhealthy habits that place the infant at greater risk for inadequate growth, infection, or chemical dependence. The younger a mother is below age 20, the greater the risk of her infant dying during the first year of life.    It is very important for pregnant teens to have early and adequate prenatal care.    This is for teenagers 19 and under.|`|NhBV2iFOaa	No. This is not true. I am 17 years old and gave birth to my now 2 year old when I was 15. I was at no risk of death. I also had 2 heart malformatites while I was pregnant. Now Im pregnant again and doing just fine.Yes, your reproductive system isnt complete til 27 years old. Still women give birth younger than the time their reproductive organs are complete.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	Actually, giving birth is one of the risky thing women do...You have a higher chance of dying during childbirth then anything else, because it is hard on heart and there is a bigger chance of a stroke, due to pushing.  They don't tell you that in school, they will tell you to use a condem, but not that it can be risky.  just to give birth.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	70 000 ? what like in the whole world? Because that is way too high of a number for just one country. But I know some teenagers are unable to carry to term because their bodies are still smaller and might have more difficult labors because their hips too are smaller and narrower than grown womans|`|mxixfE3Raa	It's more likely with people under 16 and people over 40.  I'm not sure why.
3Rr5SAhhaa	pineapple juice, walking, have sex ( orgasms) brings on labor, my mother in law swears that hot chocolate brings on labor. oh and i have heard that rosemary helps too. Good luck!!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	You sound like me and I believe the little one has dropped. I can barely walk at all! It really feels like someone hit me down below with a baseball bat or pipe. I'm being induced on Monday and I wish the days will fly by. Unfortunately I have no suggestions on trying to get labor started, I've tried everything and obviously nothings worked. Sorry honey but look on the bright side you are done! Good luck!|`|1h9DYByQaa	spd.. talk to your midwife, you have days to go though just rest x    mum of 4
1z3C0R2Vaa	No it will not my hairdresser husband have it too and she have to start using the pill because every two year she is pregnant no joke about this.So their is hope for you good luck...........|`|MtC3CWZraa	This is a question best asked of the doctor who monitors his condition.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I've only heard about it, I dont know from experience but my uncle is diabetic and he couldnt ...you know.  So he never had any kids.|`|OBgqkkqlaa	A lot of my male patients take Glucophage also known as Metformin and they don't seem to be having any trouble making babies. I don't think it could be the pills, but you should ask you doctor to find out.|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	You would need to ask his doctors that gave him the medicine. Because they would know if it would lower his sperm count. I have never heard of anything like this. But you could always make sure from the doctor. And in the mean time I had a hard time getting pregnant with my second child as well. And my doctor told me that if you are under the age of 30 it could take you up to six months and up to year over the age of 30. Also he told me and my husband to only have sex every other night. Because you are allowing your husbands sperm count to rejevuate And sperm will live in you for up to 48 hrs. So it will still get you pregnant if you have sex every other night. Hope this helps and good luck to you and your husband on the future baby!|`|6ea856e3826885a5e91b108d3f52cd32aa	I know a friend of mine is diabetic and she and her husband tried everything including fertility.  For some reason she stopped taking her meds and was pregnant right away.  She never knew there was a connection between their failed attempts and her medication until she actually conceived.|`|jLNwrVZRaa	I am not sure what pills you are talking about but you can call the doctor the prescribed them and ask if that is a possible side effect. Your pharmacist also might be able to answer that question.
HclKftzAaa	i'm only 30w4d. And i'm already ready to have the baby out! lol.    I am tired a lot lately. Sleeping in 3-4 hours burst due to a severe need to pee. My feet have recently ballooned up, and i have to drink 3 litres of water a day to stop them getting bigger- they have gone down a little bit, but are still puffy. Don't worry, my docs are all keeping an eye out for pre eclampsia. Still no sign of that.    I also have gestational diabetes, and so can't even comfort my up and down moods with food :( People ask me what pregnancy cravings i've had, and i can't answer them, because i don't get to eat what i want anyway. There's no point in me entertaining any craving ideas. So they don't stick in my brain. Though yesterday it was donuts- a HUGE no no. lol.    I think i have decided to find out the sex of the baby. Having lots of scans provides plenty of opportunity, and we've not found out yet. But i'm eager to meet my baby, and think i would like to know now. It would be nice to know what i'm doing all this work for! Ahaha.    It's summer here too- ergh. being this pregnant in the summer, not fun. spending lots of time in air conditioned room (which i'm sure just dehydrates me more and makes my feet fatter :S).    Pelvic pain, some cramps which might be light braxtons, severe interference in our sex life, none of my clothes fit (being plus size, can't find any maternity clothes. Fat people are just supposed to buy bigger sizes apparently- and yes, a lady in a maternity clothes shop DID say that to me). And i had my baby shower last weekend, and i think i'm still on a low after coming down from that high. I feel bad for eating cake and not testing my glucose levels :S Worried the baby will get too big and i'll have to be induced- or worse have a c/s.    It's a complainy day today i guess. I am glad that my hubby is sick today, so he will be home when i get back from one of my many many doctors appointments. Sigh.    Carters mommy- i'm with you there on that rolling over in bed thing :( It's great when hubby goes to work, cause i don't have to roll in the same spot, i can roll across the bed. makes it a bit easier.|`|AA10811784	I've got 9 days to go till my due date, but my doctor is giving me the option to induce on Sunday, Feb. 8th if I want to (I am currently 3 cm dilated). I'm still undecided on that though, I have to let him know by Friday (if she doesn't decide to come earlier than that). Other than feeling tired and a little swollen at the ankles and wrists, I'm feeling okay.|`|ioZeveazaa	I am 34 1/2 weeks. I am feeling alot of pain alot of the time. Whether it be rib or back there is always usually something hurting. I also am getting really bad hip pain when I sleep to the point that it is hard to sleep. My girl has gotten so big my belly looks like a beach ball on my body. The weight gain that I have gained which is about 45-50 lbs now is very difficult for me to hull around. I am a strong person but when you were 120lbs before and now are almost 170lbs in under nine months, it takes a toll on the body. It is all worth it though. Good luck!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I'm 39 weeks and 3 days, had my NST today. I'm being induced on Monday. My vag area feels like someone smashed me with a baseball bat. I can hardly walk (more like hobble), stand, etc. Been having contractions off and on, I want my son out. Oh I'm having a little boy, Mr Chase will be making his entrance sometime on Monday!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I'm 38 weeks and I'm amazed I haven't killed anyone. The best word to describe me is agitated.|`|01vMpHkWaa	im 36 weeks and 3days  im having a boy  i feel huge  and tired  just waiting to pop this guy out...tired of being pregnant even though i will miss his kicks...not his ribs jams though|`|gx4s68s8aa	31 weeks.  I have so much to do but very little energy.  My nausea is kicking me in the you know where.  Thankfully, my doctor prescribed some Zofran yesterday and my husband is hopefully picking it up tonight.  I have been throwing up like it is the first trimester.  Maybe if I get this vomiting under control I will feel better.    But everything else is O.K.  My baby is fine and all my scans look great.  So I have lots to be thankful for.      I hope you get some relief from your back pain.  Hang in there.|`|G4qP2gATaa	I'm almost 37 weeks and I'm soooo tired all the time.

I am so OVER being pregnant..lol. I can't sleep, my back hurts, my ribs and pelvis are killing me. I am sick of having to try two or three times to get up from a sitting position..lol. AND I STILL HAVE 7 WEEKS TO GO!! We have 3 boys and are hoping for a girl this time. But we decided to be surprised. Not knowing the sex is only adding to the impatientness! :) Best Wishes!!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	38 weeks.  My pubic bone hurts so bad that sometimes I seriously think it's broken, my hips are killing me, I have heartburn so bad that I can't take it anymore, anytime the baby slightly moves I cringe because it hurts so bad since there is  no more room, my belly is constantly itchy from all the stretching and when I am sleeping at night, I have to literally plan to roll over because it's too hard with this sore pubic bone/pelvis.      We have no idea what we are having.  We decided to not find out the gender this time so it's a surprise.|`|zBhwEbUkaa	I'm just into my third trimester at 26 and a half weeks. The only thing I can say about how I feel is that I hope he turns out to be one hell of a soccer or football player. My stomach is sooo sore from him kicking. I also have sciatica in both hips, so it's getting hard to move.    Other than that, I'm so excited! My husband and I just finished painting the nursery and it turned out wonderful. I can't wait. My friends are all wanting pics, but I don't have any yet.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I am now 37 weeks already! My tummy isn't as big as yours however, I have stretch marks and you don't, lucky you! I can't stand the ppl who get none, j/k. I am very uncomfortable and have a lot of pressure on my tummy. I can't wait to hold my baby boy for the first time!|`|vCWVimTzaa	I'm 39 weeks and 3 days and soooooo ready to have this baby already!|`|3DjdkRE3aa	36 weeks was by FAR the most painful part of the pregnancy for me.... the back pain the rib pain, everything!!!!

No more aches and pains! now im just anxious...|`|Gd9jdlrNaa	I am 29 weeks 4 days and I feel horrible my back hurts, I get horrible leg cramps at night so I haven't been sleeping well, my morning sickness has come back along with heart burn and are twice as bad as before so I have been loosing weight instead of gaining but my midwife says my little boy is growing fine.  I am so ready for April to come around. Hope you feel better.|`|f4c31ffa76035961741011f2df6b939aaa	I'm 29w 3d and I feel great!

LOL     I'm sorry you ladies are having such pain.. i hope my pregnancy continues to go this smoothly right up until the end!
yogS60O3aa	Hey a few months ago I switched from loestrin 24 to nuvaring.   I was worried about it at first, but now I have no regrets, I absolutely love it!  I don't breakthrough bleed like I did on the pill, and I don't get as nauseated on it either!  It's scary at first, knowing that there's some strange ring thing inside of you, but you get used to it and forget it's there!  You don't feel it, the placement doesn't matter, just as long as it's in there somewhere, and you can take it out during sex or you can leave it in.  Just don't take it out and leave it out for more than 3 hours though!  If it falls out, no big deal just pick it up wash it off and put it back in.  And just keep track on your calendar when you put it in, and take it out for your period.  (it comes with nice handy in/out calendar stickers)  Expect your period about 2 days after you remove the ring.  Keep it at room temp, or in the fridge lol.  That's all you gotta remember and you should be fine!  And my sister-in-law fell pregnant 1 month after she stopped taking the nuvaring!    Hope this helps!  E-mail me if you have more questions!  Good luck hun!|`|qeaOwuMtaa	The only thing I didnt like about it was that it was right there! I always thought it would fall out...lol but thats me being silly....And i expected it to be smaller than it was but dont worry....it still is not that big. I've been on the pill the patch, and I took the Depo Shot...didnt really care for either of those except the ring. It was great for my forgetfulness...didnt have to take it everyday, just once a month. But i would recommend it. Oh! and I got pregnant 3 months after getting off of it.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	After using the pill for years, I switched to the Nuva Ring and loved it.  I was on it for about two years, then quit and used condoms for two months (you are supposed to wait two months after birth control before trying to conceive) and then got pregnant the very first month we tried.  I found it to be very effective and easy to use since you only have to remember it once a month.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Loved it, got pregnant 2 months after getting off of it:)

bed6dc1226e60c510d55f1a075afce88aa	Will a daddy do as well?<br>  <br>  Temper tantrums come in two sorts.<br>  One is caused by frustration, (it could be as simple as trying to put the square block in the round hole). That needs a bit of patience and understanding.  You may have to help them.  If old enough, try to explain that getting angry doesn't help, and sometimes you just have to keep trying.<br>  <br>  The second is the hissy fit.  Try not to get angry.  Show it for the ridiculous behaviour it is.  Laugh, walk away, ignore them.  With older children, it is always worth hanging on to one last nappy.  Bringing it out with the words "If you're going to act like a baby, I had better dress you like one" works wonders.|`|AA12084255	Assuming there's nothing wrong with her that could make her act this way (poopy diaper, gas, beginning to get sick, etc.) just ignore her.  She wants you to pay attention to her, and by ignoring her, you're not giving her what she wants.  Don't yell, scold her, slap her hands, pick her up and love her...I mean NO attention.  You'll probably have to do this a while, and believe me...kids can scream for what seems like ages, but eventually she'll realize that mom's not going to give in, and she WILL stop.  :)|`|4ccbf6a211d612575e6325efefb899dbaa	DO NOT give into the tantrum let her lay there on the floor while you carry on, I know it will be hard. But just pretend you are carrying on as she yanks your leg just hum a tune while you do dishes ( you can grit your teeth without her seeing) Whatever you do, if you respond to a true temper tantrum, it teaches the child that is how to get your attention or whatever it is they want. It is the same philosophy as them crying themselves to sleep at night. She is doing that, I hope|`|AA10111075	So don't think I abuse my kids, but, spank her little bottom!! When my daughter started her temper tantrums, I just would spank her a couple of times, and then I'd put her in her room and shut her door and not let her out until she had calmed down started playing and stuff. Sometimes she would be in there for 20 minutes or so before I'd let her out. But she soon realized that if she threw a fit she wouldn't get her way. She's 4 yrs old now and she knows that throwing fits do not get what she wants(for the most part). Try finding the book "The Strong-Willed Child" by Dr. Dobson. Its the best book ever.|`|AA11593615	If you ignore her long enough she will stop.  That also works when trying to get them to go to sleep by their self.  No matter how bad it breaks your heart.  she will stop if she gets no attention.  I have three daughters 16, 10, 9.|`|d76896e1e64297132e8d96add00f5f7daa	I know dr. phils usggests to walk away or ignore them... here are a few links with suggestions, hope you find something that works for you!

43fe22f7b04157dae7a820c7007497b3aa	It can be damaged by scratching at it, which is likely with pink eye. I don't think the pink eye itself will cause damage to the baby, though it's best to get it looked at.

3TCWPc3Maa	Get a pet.<br>  <br>   I would advice a baby golden retriever or Labrador for you to start with.<br>  those are the type of dogs that you could actually see the significant growth in the physical build, from birth to adult.<br>  <br>  Similar to a child.<br>  <br>  But remember, only get a pet when you're ready. :D|`|LddkW0JFaa	Get a pet or tell your parents that you wouldn't mind a little brother or sister.|`|DDFSITiYaa	Redirect your energy to some other task.  A pet would be an idea but even better might be volunteering at an animal shelter, nursing home, soup kitchen, etc.  If you redirect your mental energy, you will find yourself brooding less.
464728ed3b8e3f1cdbfe29defc54f103aa	Honestly, it would be a severe disadvantage if you speak english to her - it is best she learns each language from native speakers so that she will be fluent and speak it correctly.  Speak to your daughter in your own language and let kindergarten do the same.  Kids learn so fast - my son was fluently bilingual in less than 6 months of school.    Oh and the other important thing if this is a very young child is consistency.  ONE language per situation/person. Children can easily grasp that with mum they speak one language, daddy speaks another, at daycare they speak another.   DO NOT switch between!!!!  This would confuse the child.  The problems come when trying to mix them up, thinking you are doing them a favour.  Little children can;t understand that one word you say is in one language and another word you say is a different language so if you do this you will create a child that tries to speak sentences in a mix of languages.  I have seen this over and over again and it is a shame for the poor child.  It also means of course that their verbal ability in both languages is very far behind where it should be.  This is frustrating for the child, who cannot express himself, and means he/she will struggle at school.      If you are going to raise a bilingual child please do it properly.  There is a right and a wrong way.  Mixing languages is a definite wrong way, as is speaking to your child in a language that is foreign to you!|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Teach her both! It will help her a lot later on. Plus it's easier to learn a language while you are young.|`|0PLukncRaa	I work with a lot of infants/preschoolers who speak both English and Spanish and I personally think it's a huge advantage for them. Their families and people like you are raising a generation to bridge cultural gaps and that's an amazing thing!    Also your native language is a part of your and your child's culture and it should be an important part of both of your lives.    As for school, if she knows some of both languages she'll learn when it's appropriate to speak each one. Trust that your child has the ability and she'll flourish. :)|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	no way would it be a disadvantage! If anything it would be an advantage. Children pick up languages FAST. The kid downstairs can speak and understand english and spanish and he is just 6. Don't worry.|`|AA11327039	As long as you are reading to her and speaking to her in the local language then she should be just fine. She needs to be fluent in both languages (yours and the local language).  Just read read read to her as much as you can from different sources too.  The newspaper, magazines, your favorite books, and of course lots and lots of children's books.    It's actually beneficial to speak two different languages to a child from birth because it helps the brain to make more connections which is supposed to create a smarter child.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	no its actually a good thing because this is when its the easiest for them to pick it up.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Absolutely not! Research has shown that babies and young children are capable of learning a number of languages simultaneously so please, please talk to your daughter in your mother tongue and let her learn English too. She'll pick both languages up just fine, I promise you.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I taught my child both languages  since she goes to a Native School  We dont have a problem|`|4U7327Mzaa	Your child will be able to better retain another language the earlier she starts learning it.  Teach her your native language.|`|Vo4IXBdtaa	no it would not be a disadvantage! you would be doing her a favor. the younger the child is when he or she learns a second language the easier it is for them plus they will be able to pick up additional languages easier later on. Go on, speak in your native tongue!|`|3fYRi1y4aa	I dont have the same problem as you but, I think you should speak your native toungue to her!  Just teach her english also.  Like switch back and forth so that she will get the benefits of both!  I wish I knew 2 languages!|`|ibeYAlwpaa	I personally think it is absolutely beneficial for a baby to be in a bilingual enviornment. I do you somewhat feel that you baby could be at a slight disadvantage if you soley spoke your native tongue to her.  I wish I could offer that same option to my little girl! I would love for her to be Bilingual!|`|DPegPYRPaa	While I agree with everyone here about it's benefits, it will also be a lot harder for you to teach them both english and your native tongue at the same time as it may confuse her. A friend of mine is french and she married a chinese man and they have 5 children. They tried to speak all 3 languages to them but to this day, not one speaks anything but english. It would benefit your children as long as you have the patience and time to teach them both.

If you can't afford at least $150, don't bother buying new.

366c62abf253303d4329f443c483477faa	Te cuento que cuando me entere que esta embarazada, en los primeros dos meses no tenia ganas de tener relaciones sexuales, sino mas bien estaba necesitadas de mimos, porque la verdad es que te sentís super rara porque sabes que adentro tuyo se esta formando un nuevo ser y vivís como en una nube de amor, no haces otra cosa que pensar y hablar de tu embarazo.<br>  Pero después cuando pasa un poco la euforia, volves a hacer las mismas cosas que antes.<br>  En cambio en los últimos meses, no es que no tengas ganas sino que ya no te sentis tan bien, por lo menos en mi caso que mi bebe era grande, peso 4.400 Kg. seguimos haciendo el amor, hasta la noche anterior al día que nació, salo que ya lo hacíamos una vez por semana y no con la regularidad que lo hacíamos antes.<br>  Besos y espero que te haya resuelto tu incertidumbre!!|`|f9ddfbaaa0861827c32d9accd35d1b98aa	Eso depende de la persona.<br>  Realmente no es que dejes de tener ganas, es que a partir del 7-8 mes, no es aconsejable porque puedes llegar a da?ar al feto.

gx4s68s8aa	No- food poison only effects you.  Now if you get too dehydrated and can't keep down fluids at all, then that could hurt your baby.  But as long as you are retaining much of your fluids then it is fine.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	It's possible, but remember, the placenta is there to filter out toxins.  If you're concerned contact your health care provider :-)|`|UiXJLrDWaa	i dont think so but call your doctor and ask him what he thinks.|`|HclKftzAaa	some can. in fact the main reason you're not supposed to eat things like pre-prepared salads, deli meats and soft cheeses is in case it contains listeria- a type of food poisoning. This can easily cross the placenta.    If you were not also having a 'food escape' from either end, i would not worry that it was food poisoning. :)    If the cramps are gone i wouldn't worry. If they're still there, just pop to the doc for a check up.
R7U1sDd1aa	Yes, I would say that it is very likely that you could be pregnant. It's not very common, but some women have their full period even while being pregnant. Also Implantation bleeding "heaviness" can vary from women to women. I didn't even have the implantation bleeding, but a lot of women do. Everybody is so different when it comes to pregnancy. I'm currently 18 weeks pregnant with a little boy. So, go take a test, to give yourself some relief. If the pregnancy test is negative, and you are still having symptoms of pregnancy, go to your Doc, and have a blood HCG level drawn..Good luck! Let me know how it turns out!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Implantation bleeding isn't heavy so I don't think that's what that was.|`|3SIRKIBaaa	Well, they say that some people can go months and not know that they are pregnant because they still get a period. It all depends on your body. So if your periods are normally regular, and this time it wasn't, I would take a test just so you can find out for sure. I wish you luck and if it comes out positive, :) Congratulations in advance.|`|oMGasIcjaa	Maybe what you thought was menstruation was implantation bleeding!  Take a test to find out for sure. :)
ZYlr9TSBaa	http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/...    Here is a link with a list of foods rich in iron, plus some meal ideas :)|`|v3LnJycKaa	anytime you take your iron pill make sure not to take it with any calcium or vit d it can inhibit the absorbtion of Iron, take it with vit c and or a folic acid that assists in the absorbtion;    Dark leafy greens  red meat  beats  legumes  beans    I have had anemia since birth and had to be on an anemic diet since i was about 10... my body does not absorb or store iron efficiently basically  my only iron is what is eaten that day...|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Spinach, beans, cereal, whole grains, dried fruits, beef, and pork contain good sources of iron.  Also, make sure to get enough vitamin C because it helps with the absorption of iron in your bloodstream.  Make sure you avoid drinking tea because it contains tannin which decreases iron absorption.  Good luck!
Er3imE5Yaa	Hey!    YIP! i got the headaches but not the veins thing!  i also got heartburn and i still have it.  Its getting worse i think.  Dont stress to much about your symptoms because it might take a turn and be your af.  More relax and let things happen without you taking to much notice with whats happening.    Baby Dust to you and hope you get a BFP!|`|tIwXLPzFaa	well I am also unsure about whether I could be pregnant and I have recently been getting very bad headaches also and feeling light headed.  I have heard that your veins do show up more during first stages of pregnancy so it could be possible that you are pregnant but i guess you will find out tomorrow! good luck and i hope you get the result you want!|`|f5EpgnB5aa	nope. i didn't experience any of those but i knwo ppl who get really tired. everyone is different.|`|zBhwEbUkaa	I didn't get the headaches until about 12 weeks and my veins didn't start showing until about a month after that. The only symptoms that I had right before I found out was really bad nausea and cramps.
DPegPYRPaa	Girls tend to potty train at an earlier age than boys. It would be great to have it there and just let him sit on it and play with it and get used to it, but I don't think you should start actual potty training with him until maybe 24 months. He just may not be ready. He may not be able to control those muscels yet. Good Luck.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i tey at 20 months but she will not sit still

3gXQPso5aa	I have eczema and so does BOTH of my kids, I have tried everything from Vasoline, Eccerin, and Aveeno nothing worked better then Derma Smoothe. You can get it by precription and it is the BEST it clears my and my kids skin up and has it looking so pretty, and I have severe eczema and it works well. If you don't want to try that try washing all of her clothes in Dreft and keep her away from anything with perfume in it. And wash her in NOTHING but Dove and use Eccerin as her lotion|`|69SHxWA9aa	Here is how they are treating and curing Eczema and Psoriasis in Japan.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQ...

They can also make the 2.5 PH acidic water used in this video at the Hospital in Japan.    Drinking the alkaline water is one key, the other is the 2.5 PH water applied to the skin disease, and it will go away in around 5 months.

It's in a blue bottle. It's unscented. Also, his doctor prescribed Hydrocortisone Valerate. I also used Eczema bath made by Disney.|`|wqEKWd59aa	My newborn experienced the same thing.  The worst areas are in the folds of his arms and legs.  He is a teen today and he has been to dermatologist and been prescribed prescription lotions and the whole shabang.  Sounds like you have done all you can over the counter stuff.  Just do yourself a favor make sure your baby does not scratch the red irritated areas because if the baby's hands are dirty and breaks skin, a bad infection can develop.  My son woke up one morning and had pus bumps all over his arms it freaked me out!  I was at the emergency that morning.  Keep the nails short and little hands clean.  Believe me that is hard to keep a little boys hands clean as he gets older and I believe it will be just as difficult for girls to.  The doctor said they may or may not grow out of it.  I can tell you that with age the eczema has improved some but not cleared up.  Hope your baby skin improves.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Run a humidifier at night, bathe every 2-3 days and immediately after put cetaphil cream (in the tub, not pump) on, this locks the moisture in, double rinse the clothes, wash them seperately and use all clear or dreft.  You can buy cortizone 10 extra strength ointment, this is 1 percent and is a low potency steroid, this should be used if it is raised, itchy, thickened skin that is constantly being scratched and will become infected unless it calms down.  Steroids can be used 2x/day but less than half the days of the month.  Another helpful ointment is calendula great for any type of skin irritation/abrasion.    Elidel is a step down cream used when off the steroid its a script, we have it.    Eucerin and aquaphor come highly recommended though my son reacted badly to them, they contain lanolin, a wool derivative, and an irritant to sensitive skin|`|YAwvszITaa	take her to the doctor my son suffered with eczema from around that age and the doctor gave us some great options to soothe his skin and made life easier for all of us. I did use Dove Unscented and Eucerin cream for his skin.|`|dSSFrYUxaa	My daughter has eczema and pediatrician prescribed her Elidel.But for over the counter i use Eucerin calming creme its a bit expensive the when i use the two together it clears it up|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	My son had really bad baby eczema and the first thing that the doctor suggested that was over the counter was Cetephil (something like that, I'm not sure how it's spelled). You can try that and if it doesn't work you will have to get a prescription from the doctor. That's what I had to do, but my son had it all over and really bad on his face.

Just chill out and try not to let it get you worked up (again, as much as you can).|`|41ccaf0cf96865f8f9c8fc048929c8b5aa	Maybe you are thinking to much about it, when you stress about it sometimes it makes you not have your period.

It may be what is making this occur.|`|d74b137e2cd084f63c1704957cb351e9aa	im never late with my period either, I took a pregnancy test  and it came back neg, then i waited about another week and it came back positive. It all depends on the hormone levels. I know they double each day. I would wait a week then test again. Good luck
ezMoS0mqaa	I've had the exact same problem, been very irregular since coming off the pill but the rule of thumb is if you want to do a test go by the longest ever cycle you've had so for you that would be test at cd34.  Unfortunately, i have found that irregular periods in general mess with your hormones and can give some convincing pregnancy like symptoms but experience has taught me that it's not necessarily the case. The longer the cycle the more symptoms you find but i think maybe that's because you are hoping you are pregnant. Good luck to you|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I'd wait till you are on day 34 and then test since that was your longest cycle.

I know some tests promise results on the first day or your missed period, but thats not always the case. While ttc I was taking tests all the time to just check! You can buy ovulation tests to know for sure when you are ovulating and then can judge by then when to take a pregnancy test. You might also try a website designed to enter your dates of your period and it can help to predict when you'll ovulate and have your period. Good luck and keep positive!
6mhFHSRSaa	When you have an ultrasound will almost always depend on the policies of your OB doctor's office.     In my current pregnancy, I had an established relationship with a gynecologist, no relationship with an OB, and a history of a rare type of abnormal pregnancy. When I got pregnant, I went to the gynecologist first. The gynecologist ordered an ultrasound at 6 weeks to make sure everything looked normal and that I didn't have another complication like the first. I also had blood tests to see how quickly HCG (the hormone released by the implanting embryo) was being produced. That early in an ultrasound, all they are really looking to see is whether there is an embryo implanted in the uterus, a gestational sac, a progesterone-producing cyst in your ovaries, possibly a heartbeat, and other basic normal features of pregnancy. This much care that early is not "normal." They did these things because I had a history of problems and they wanted to make sure that this was a viable pregnancy before sending me to an OB.    What is much more normal is that they don't want to see you before week 8 or so. That was true with me for my first (abnormal) pregnancy, and I found it very frustrating. I wanted care and advice right away, but my OB office didn't want to see me until week 8, so I found a gynecologist who used to do OB work who would at least confirm my pregnancy and give me some advice about diet and what medications I could take while pregnant. At 8 weeks, I had my first ultrasound with my regular OB, at which time I found out about my rare pregnancy abnormality that meant that the baby had stopped developing a few days earlier. I should add that earlier care would *not* have made a difference in the outcome of that pregnancy. The truth is, there is very little doctors can do to prevent early losses. That is, I believe, part of the reason why they ask women to wait. By 8 weeks, some of the very early losses will already have happened, and doctors can see more of the baby via ultrasound and it will be a little more clear how healthy it is.    For this pregnancy (which I explained in the first paragraph), my current OB didn't want to see me until 9 weeks, at which time I had my first ultrasound in his office. I had those other earlier ultrasounds in my gynecologist's office, and when I finally saw the OB at 9 weeks, I had a nice file to take with me.     So, your first ultrasound, unless you have bleeding or other problems that mean they need to take a look early (which I hope you do not have to experience - it's very scary), will probably not be for several weeks.     In the meantime, you should be able to get your pregnancy confirmed by a doctor and perhaps get some advice about diet and lifestyle and maybe even a prescription for prenatal vitamins. If you haven't been taking folic acid, you should probably start immediately. Some of the most critical neurological development for your baby will happen before your first appointment (especially around week 5 of your pregnancy), and folic acid is critical to that development. If you cannot get your OB to see you, try going to your family doctor or gynecologist. They can help you get started on the right track while you wait for the first OB appointment.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	If they do it before then they might not see anything. Sometimes they don't even see anything at 6-8 weeks. At 4 weeks your sister in law had to have an internal ultra sound for them to see anything. They can know your pregnant and not see anything though, she might of just had a pee test or a blood test (which can tell a few days after you had sex).|`|FIALhwlKaa	You can find out before the sixth week if you are pregnant with a pregnant test, but you wont see really anything at the ultrasound. At 6 weeks pregnancy the doc can see the little something - which will be one day your baby.
nbSp469Waa	I did with my last baby.  At around 6 or 7 weeks I was cramping very bad, to the point I was in tears, and I also had light spotting.  I never bled bright red blood or anything, just pinkish.  My doctor told me that some woman have that and nothing turns out to be wrong.  I delivered her at 39 weeks 1 day and she weighed 7 pounds 11ounces.|`|ioZeveazaa	at 5 1/2 weeks I found out I was pregnant. That very same day I got real bad cramps in the evening and they went away when I went to sleep. The next morning I asked my husband to take me to the ER because I wanted an ultrasound to check on the baby. Lo and behold there was a tiny tear in the placenta but the baby had a heartbeat. The doctor told me to rest and try to take it easy because of this and that is was a threatened miscarriage. I am now 34 1/2 weeks wth my little girl and as far as I know she is healthy as a horse. She is active everyday. I get an ultrasound on Friday to see how she is and if I may need a c-section or not because my doctor and I think she is still breech. If you arem't  bleeding a lot and cramping then you should be ok. When you get the two together and get alot of blood then you should worry. Always though, if you think something is wrong and wanted attention immediately, go to the ER and get checked. Don't wait. Good luck!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	This might not be what you want to hear, but I just had a miscarriage.  It was very early on and I did not get a very faint positive until 17 dpo.  I had my blood drawn the same day and my HCG was very low (only at 12).  They told me I may miscarry and I had VERY bad cramps for one day and then I started bleeding a lot (not spotting).  So if your only spotting then you may go on to have a healthy pregnancy.  Just rest and take it easy!!!  Good Luck.|`|qPmQvqJXaa	Most women will have some degree of cramping and spotting during early pregnancy because of the implantation. That is totally normal, but it scared me alot when it happened.  I have friends who even had it during their last trimester due to a type of varicose vein on the uterine wall erupting.  All of their babies were fine.  Good luck!|`|4d33006d173d8d1adcaf0e22cf5af0efaa	i did with my first....it was around 10 weeks they put me on bedrest until the 12 week mark and i had a baby girl at 38 weeks  with no other problems after that little scare
52bAHCaUaa	Are you supposed to take the sugar pills during that time, if so then yes you are covered.     The pill is designed to work 99.9% effectively if you take all the pills you are supposed to.
AA11981363	well, in the last weeks, BH contractions can help dilate a bit, but in active labor contractions are the only way to feel you are dilating, the stronger the contractions get, the more you dilate (in theory though, many women don't progress and end up having c sections)|`|MtC3CWZraa	Nope. There's no way to know.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	NOPE, YOU CAN FEEL THE CONTRACTIONS, THAT'S WHEN YOU START DIALATING|`|Uu9qXGGuaa	I just gave birth to my first child in Nov.  Two weeks before I went to my dr. and he said I was already 3 centimeters and I didn't even know and I still had to be induced 2 weeks later.  Also, I'm sure your dr. explained to you that two week before and after your expected due date is in the ballpark range of giving birth.  So you are getting really close to that time frame.  But my dr and all the books I've read said it just depends on the person.  If you feel like something is different, go to the dr. and make sure.  It's not worth the risk in case something is wrong.  It's always better to be safe than sorry.
tn2qhjYAaa	Speak to your doctor asap, befoe you take anymore, perhaps he would never have given you the antibiotics if he had known you were pregnant.  If they are dangerous he will prescribe you something else.  A UTI will need to be treated though.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Most antibiotics are safe to take while pregnant, but you'd want to call the doc.  If you're taking one of the 'unsafe' types, he'll probably switch your antibiotic.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	Before you take them, call your doctor and discuss it. Or talk to the pharmacy where you filled the prescription. A lot of times doctors don't like to give women antibiotics in the first trimester, but with a UTI, it has to be treated and depending on the type of antibiotic you were given will depend on whether you should take it or not.|`|F0rbWQL8aa	Call and talk to your doctor.  It is probably more dangerous to have the infection than to take the pills.  If a drug is class A, it is safe.  Class B is probably safe and Class C they don't know.  Your doctor might be able to get you a different, safer antibiotic.  I had to take a class C antibiotic for an infection while I was pregnant and everything turned out fine.  Drugs.com is a great way to find out what class the drug is in and what the risk is.  I don't trust doctor's as I have been lied to a lot.  I ask the doctor and then research it on my own.|`|45a8c885a9b24a213fe52c9cba5e4a24aa	you could check with the 24 hour pregnancy helpline. They have registered nurses available to answer questions like this anonymously. The number is 1-800-395-4357.

073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	That is a pretty good deal! I liked Prowraps when my daughter was a new born and they were fine - did the job stopping leaks. Now I use mostly Bummis & Thirsties covers. I love all the Bummis prints and the bright Thirsties colours. My favourites are the Thirties because they fit so much trimmer than the other covers and have double leg gussets. Easy to wipe down the inside PUL material after a pee change. Although I sometimes use a snappi, I usually just fold the prefold in 3 and lay it in the wrap. I even tuck it in the front fold though the Bummis manufacturer says not to on account of wicking. Haven't had that problem with any of my wraps.|`|yB5go5wbaa	That's a great deal, I've got prowraps and some thirsties covers.  I haven't used them yet because my baby still isn't here, but the lady I bought them from said they're awesome (I got 2nds too).  The best way to fasten the prefold is with a Snappi - no pins and they don't budge!  Happy diapering!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Snappi is the way to go with a prefold.  I have read mixed reviews on the prowrap covers. The Thirsties covers are my favorite followed by Bummis SuperBrites.  Thirsties have the best gussets to make sure everything stays in!|`|9tNr1RMfaa	I have used the Prorap Classic. They are awesome covers, they contain leaks really well. And, the price can't be beat. They are much more affordable than the Bummi's covers.     If you have a newborn or young baby who is still exclusively breastfed, I would recommend that you fasten your prefolds with a snappi. If this is done properly you will not have to worry about blow-outs.

5UkfSahsaa	When I found out I was pregnant, I asked my tanning salon if it was safe if I continued using them. They said no and they put a block by name so I can't go back for a year. They said it's to do with the skin pigmentation changing in your body which my doctor agreed with when I asked them.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	NO! It's not safe at all. Ask your Dr. You've been going this WHOLE PREGNANCY 4 TIMES A WEEK? Wow...The main reason that using a tanning bed or similar is bad for you and your unborn baby is due to the level of heat your body reaches during the session. Think about how hot these sessions are and how uncomfortable they are for you at times, now imagine the affect that this would have on a developing baby. Your not even supposed to be in a hot bath... your lying under fluorescent light bulbs...|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Check with your dr, their opinion is the only one that matters.|`|R1zUIh7taa	It isn't okay at all!  It is good to be out in the sun but not okay at all to go tanning!|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Tanning in a tanning bed isn't safe whether you are pregnant or not.  It makes your risk of skin cancer even higher than tanning in the sun.  But most people who like to tan won't believe that so just keep in mind that you don't want to get your body temperature too high while you are pregnant.  The baby will be even warmer than you are and the baby can't regulate it's body temperature.  It is like you are cooking the baby in the amniotic fluid if you do.
AA11763588	When you fill out the paperwork it will ask you how many times you've been pregnant and how many of those times did you miscarry.    You should note it down, it's for you and your DR's benefit. You can talk to the DR alone and ask him/her that you would not like to talk about it when your spouse is with you.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Why would u be ashamed? It wasnt something you did or anything it was out of your control...the doctor cant just tell but you should let them no that way they can be aware if any complications come up. Good luck.|`|qImMwhUHaa	The doctor can tell. When you fill out all the info. when you go to your obgyn, just put confidential by the question that asks you if you have ever had a miscarriage so they'll know not to bring it up in front of your husband.|`|HIZ1G175aa	yes they can tell with a lot of test but its best you let them know anyway for your own health|`|Ildi2rYfaa	Your Doctor should be told your full and accurate medical history. He won't be able to just take a peek and know though. Unless you are going to the Doctor for pregnancy or conception issues (then he really must be told) then he is not liklely to bring the matter up at all. If that situation arises, let the DR know that you don't want the infomation leaked to your husband or anybody else who may accompany you to your DRs visits.     It's too bad you don't have an open and honest relationship with your husband :(
FgAPXhVRaa	I was on birth control and I got pregnant... :)|`|gx4s68s8aa	This pregnancy is a pull out pregnancy.  I should have known better.  But I can't go on birth control pills because of a clotting disorder.  So my husband and I used the pull out method one time and I got pregnant.  I should have used the sponge, spermicide or something, but I didn't.  All is well for us.  We were planning on having another child, just not quite this soon.|`|s1utniuvaa	I was on BC to regulate period and cramps so no pull out here... we thought it was all good... esp since I was told I couldn't have more children.|`|AA11981363	1st time I got pg using the pulling out method.  2nd time I got pg because the condom just didn't work LOL    You could get pg anytime you have sex, birth control or not.|`|5WYeHh0paa	We didnt pull out or use condoms.  I had an ectopic pregnancy and it scarred one of my fallopian tubes so I was told getting pregnant would be damn near impossible. So we got the shock of our lives when my husband I found out we were pregnant.|`|em8A42Bqaa	pull out is dangerous, you can and will get pregnant.  It worked for me for 3 years, then unknowingly my husband decided he wanted a baby and didnt tell me until I got pregnant and he said he didnt pull out!    28 1/2 weeks!|`|eya1WDS4aa	I was on birth control and we wore condoms and he pulled out and i got pregnant. The pull out method is not a protection against getting pregnant. My friend wasnt on any birth control and he only pulled out and she got pregnant and it was a one night stand thing.|`|w9xx0SPaaa	We used the "pull out" method i guess we knew it wasnt the smartest idea but im am now 25 weeks pregnant

No es necesario esperar tanto tiempo, al tener tu menstruación indica que inicia otro ciclo y solo te ayuda como marcador, ademas recuerda que no somos fertiles todos los dias del mes solo cuando se presenta la ovulacion y eso ocurre a la mitad del ciclo, por lo tanto los primeros 7 dias tampoco hay riesgo de embarazo puesto que no hay ovulacion, pero es una recomendacion que si quieres estar completamente segura la puedes tomar. Saludos!!!!|`|da91cc2ab82248dcc801e706657b629aaa	al momento de empezar a tomar pastillas tienes que seguir tomándolas por un largo tiempo si las días corres el riesgo de quedar embarazada de inmediato la mejor recomendacion es si dejarlas pero tener sexo seguro con condón no hay de otra|`|HMhYAlaVaa	después que termines el primer tratamiento y ya hayas tenido tu menstruación y comiences el segundo, en algunas marcas de anticonceptivos como yazmin, viene un peque?o instructivo y ahí indica no tener relaciones sin preservativo durante el primer mes de uso de las pastillas, en el segundo ya es seguro, obviamente mientras mas tiempo pase mejor, pero ten en cuenta que no debes de saltarte ninguna por que si no ya no va tener la misma eficacia|`|w5cc7kQ1aa	se dividen las opiniones pero yo te puedo decir que desde que tomas la primer pastilla todo esta controlado, sino los mismos ginecologos de dirian que utilizes algo anexo a las pastillas para cuidarte, tengo una ginecologa de confianza y al iniciar la toma de pastillas para cuidarte ya estas muy protegida.
OxFV92hJaa	Anyone with any knowledge on fetal development would know that the ears and kidneys develop at the same time in the womb! So there's the conection lol. Ears/kidney develop at the same time, and a problem with either automatically calls for tests to rule out abnormalities.     I didn't see your question, nor click your link. But that is basic comon sense knowledge that anyone who has been pregnant should know. If they don't, then I question their overall concern for anything in general. Not to mention the fact that they didn't care enough to keep track of what was occuring while their baby was growing inside them. Sorry, but thats ridiculous. It isn't hard to gain info and insight, especially when it's a life you created. I want to know as much as possible about anything and everything I can. Call me nuts, but that's just common sense thinking to me. If I didn't want to be bothered, why would I have had kids to begin with.    Anyone that actually relies on this sight for ligit info is a moron. Simple as that.     You have bored people passing time on here. Nothing more, nothing less.  It is by no means a replacement to genuine knowledge.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i'm trying unsuccessfully to make sense of this question.  perhaps that proves i'm dumb, though i doubt my stupidity is because of my kids.  at any rate, i would not really use "yahoo" and "knowledge base" in the same sentence.  this is a good forum for support and the sharing of opinions.  for knowledge i'd look elsewhere, to somewhere with verifiable sources.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I think a better question would be "do you know how to evaluate scholarly resources?"   And the answer to that is yes, I do. I didn't see your question, but I wouldn't have answered it anyway because it wasn't a question. It was just a statement of your opinion as far as I can tell. This is a question and answer forum and I come here for entertainment. If someone wants scholarly information they should seek out an expert. Experts publish in peer reviewed journals, lecture at universities, or have careers in the field in which they are considered an expert. One is able to verify their educational background, training, field work, and contributions to industry. I'm not likely to consider someone posting an opinion on yahoo answers an expert.     Having a child has nothing to do with my opinion on this matter.|`|BAmNCDXUaa	yeah They Do that Alot but not with me  I speak abt my brother,his 6 yrs Kid   Always  say alot of bad words he listen it somewhere to his parents    the big  Example"**** YOU"|`|VLr3jrutaa	No.  Yahoo is people around the world giving their personal opinion about certain things based on personal experience, things they teach, or have been taught|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I think I understand your question. Your thinking that a lot of parents on Yahoo! come on Yahoo! for all of their parenting needs, instead of asking a doctor (if it's health related) or researching it themselves.    I think some people ask certain questions not because they can't easily find out through google, but because they like the interaction aspect by asking on Yahoo!. It's more of a social thing, I guess. So maybe that's why parents get sucked into Yahoo! for questions easily found by searching google (despite losing 5 points and waiting longer for an answer).    However, some parents will ask genuine questions they can't find the answer to, despite searching the web. Other times it can be a question that is asking for opinions, when absolute answers are not available.    I think what Yahoo! does do to *some* parents, is make them rude, sarcastic, and arrogant.
1u4CS5J3aa	its possible. sperm can survive that long in search of an egg. there is a 20% chance each month to concieve.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Your cervical mucus changes through the month from creamy to thick egg white which to more slippery clear mucus right when you are ovulating.  After ovulation it goes back to creamy again.  So you have to aim for the time it is very thin and slippery.  Quantity is not an issue, only consistancy apparently.<br>  <br>  You could conceive 3 to 4 days before ovulation as sperm have been known to last a long time inside the womb.  So could be possible, but is probably better to have sex closer to ovulation.

IC32ZuDlaa	I agree with 'theyknowmeas.." about the medicaid. it's your best bet. I used to work for DCF in the medicaid office, and MOST states have a simplified Pregnancy medicaid application (meaning that it's usually just a 1 page application) and you will have to provide your income information and that of the baby's father (if living with you). Just check with your local medicaid office to find out exactly what information you will need to provide, given your situation. :) hope this helps!!!!!<br>   ALSO: if/when approved for the medicaid, it usually covers EVERYTHING associated with the pregnancy except for circumcision and any sonogram that is not medically necessary. usually with NO copay.|`|8824fc230695852baa6df8d684a06dc7aa	you half to have a bank account and a credit card, i tried to do that but it sounds like its worth it but everyone told me no, so now i am on medicaid witch i dont pay any thing at all, and i have to go back their 6 months after the babys born to give them a copy of the birth certifict, and a copy of the ss card so try medicaid ;)  good luck ~

bkOn30I1aa	My cousin uses around 3-5 thousand txt messages a month, yes i know, it is incredible but it is the truth! You better get your kid unlimited if you want to save money!|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Maybe 100 -200.|`|91hxNCfWaa	I'm 16, I share an unlimited plan with my parents. I find that the best option, no surprises for my parents. When I wasn't on unlimited, I think I had 1500? So anywhere between 800-1000 texts is probably average ;)<br>  <br>  * I know it seems like a large number, but we teens DO text quite a bit.|`|mfVZryINaa	You should be grateful no matter HOW many your parents are paying for.  Texts are a luxury, not a necessity.|`|cLLXiUJ3aa	Well my friends have told me that in a month they have done about 6,000!!! i noe it sounds rediculous! but some have done more!<br>  <br>  i think the average is about 2 or 3,000.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	zero, a 15 year old doesn't need texting on their phone until they have a job and they can pay for their own line.<br>  <br>  I'll be damned if my kids get cell phones before they have a job.|`|ZcmMA4GBaa	Are you the texter, or are you the one paying for it? :)<br>  I would say the average is between 2000 and 3000 /mo.<br>  Few years ago when I was in my mid 20's my record was around 2400. For the US I have unlimited plan but I text with Europe which kills me 20c/text.|`|CY0PZQ5Raa	I had an average of about 300 when I was 28!!!  So I would have to think it would and could be someone around the 1000 or more mark.  My nephew is 11 and he seems to constantly text his friends even if it's only with a one word answer.  The text's sure do rack up!
AOvtRBU9aa	it's a phase. My daughter went through that but outgrew it when she learned to crawl at 8 months. She went the opposite direction and would not let me hold her now. Best wishes. I remember I was miserable, arms always numb and can't do anything around the house.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Separation anxiety is hitting your baby and it's so very normal. The best thing you can do now is tend to your baby's needs. They are looking for the affection that only mom and dad can provide. If you are able, I would pick her up.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, when I am trying to do things like clean, or pack since we are moving this week, she can sit there and whine until I get around to her. As long as I know she is safe, fed, and not in any kind of pain or discomfort she gets to wait. Now she usually crawls to me lol.<br>  <br>  I don't care much for the term spoil before 1yr. I'll give my daughter as much love as I can possibly give. She'll only be this young for a little while and it's not like when she's 15 years old she'll want me to carry her lol.|`|rdbRGWfzaa	how old is your daughter?  if she's around 4 months old and if your comfortable with it, maybe you could let her cry it out for a few minutes at a time. and you can stand there and assure her everything is ok.  before 4 months old, they don't really know how to self-soothe.<br>  <br>  ***edited to add - <br>  <br>  oh if I'm correct, I heard that stranger anxiety starts at 7 months old and a baby will be very clingy and only want to be with their parents.  that could be the case.  it happened to my nephew around 7 months old, but he quickly grew out of it though.  It's probably just a phase!|`|CY0PZQ5Raa	My son is a little similar.  He is held quite often and likes to make a big song and dance when he is put down.  Quite often I will sit down on the floor next to him for a little while and hold his hand just to reassure him that I'm still there, just not holding him.  He will cry for a little while but something on his play mat always grabs his attention and he will settle.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	what ever you do, don't do the "cry it out" method. that is horrible to do to a child. <br>  <br>  however you can put her down and talk to her and Comfort her without holding her. that way she knows you are there. yes she is going to cry and that is ok as long as your are there and let her know you are there. <br>  <br>  her world is so big and unsafe. she needs to know her protector (mommy) is always there. <br>  <br>  honestly in a few months she will be walking and pushing away from you to go run. enjoy the moments you have cradling her in your arms.
91ddcd8d05a1b03e42d3f3cc6f935c06aa	His stomach is the size of a jelly bean, don't worry he is getting enough food! Just keep nursing!! Mymilk came after 4 days. Good luck!|`|5ZvALiclaa	firstly colostrum is really hard to pump. its thick and definately better being drawn by your son actually feeding so do not stop feeding yet!! It will come in, just give it time.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief breastmilk can take 5-7 not 3 days to actually be in and replace the colostrum. You'll know by his poos changing from the black tar to the yellow seedy stuff. Once it starts to change you know your milk is in.<br>  <br>  Keep feeding him every 2 hours at least. If you don't want the bottles, syringe feed him so he doesn't end up with nipple confusion while you wait a couple of days for your milk to properly come in. <br>  My bestfriend took 5 days both times to get her milk and the hospital did the syringe feeding with whatever she could pump inbetween breastfeeds and then topped with formula from the syringe too and she never had trouble with nipple confusion and baby still took breastmilk no problems.<br>  <br>  Also go to the doctors first thing tomorrow or later today (whichever depending on what time it is where you are) and ask them for the tablets that stimulate milk production. They literally work overnight, you'll be bursting so give that a go. <br>  <br>  You know the benefits of b/feeding, don't give up, see the doctor, keep feeding all the time and pump what you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on the newest addition to your family!!|`|YRTNpOO7aa	First off STOP being so hard on yourself,not everyone can breastfeed there baby's.<br>  I know people say breast is best,but It's not always possible to do.<br>  Both my baby's were on formula milk and they are both bright and brainy,they are above average for there age,so it has done them no harm not having breast milk.<br>  To Try and get your breast milk to come out,have a hot bath then put a hot cloth over your boob's so it will stimulate them into getting some milk out,then once they fill up they will be like that until you stop breast feeding. <br>  <br>  Good luck,and congratulations on your second baby,enjoy him as they grow up so fast.|`|jypbBYOBaa	I desperately wanted to breastfeed my son but he was born very low birth weight and ended up on the neonatal unit. I continually tried to breastfeed him but I too wasn't producing enough milk and I persevered in hospital for 10 days putting him to the breast and using a breast pump to try to stimulate my milk flow but it just wasn't happening for me and he was being formula fed through a tube anyway as he was far too low birth weight to risk withholding food to force him to depend on breast feeding so I gave in and he is now on special formula for small babies.  I bought a breast pump so that I could try to continue to express milk at home to boost the flow but after 10 minutes pumping on each breast I still only had about 5mls of milk in the pot!! I did try to breastfeed at home but because I had no milk there he would just get so angry and frustrated and scream at my breast and then we would both end up stressed! Now we are both happy as I can actually feed him now using formula! I gave it my best shot but if it doesn't happen for you this time then you have tried and don't beat yourself up about it. Try not to stress yourself as stress hormones act to reduce your milk flow - easier said than done though as I was so determined to feed my son my own breast milk that I continually tried and made us both stressed and upset in the process but hey ho it wasn't to be. Fennel tea and fenugreek can boost milk supply if that is of any help to you??|`|8mxF01Psaa	My milk also only came after 3 days. But for the first 3 days I had nothing, not even colostrum. It was horrible and my poor child had to be cup fed. I don't think you can not get any milk at all. ....You have to sometime, normally 3 or 4 days I would think, if not immediately.|`|w6KRRJOsaa	My milk came in after four days, its can take about four to five days sometime|`|cG80UU5Waa	You need to let your son suckle, it's the only way to stimulate your breasts to produce milk. He's two days old, he does not need anything other than colostrum. Don't pump, don't give him bottles (of anything), don't give him formula. Boob only! Anything else will seriously undermine any chance of breastfeeding working out. He's only 2 days old, he's a clean slate. It might be a rough day or so to get him back to breastfeeding but it's better than 12 months old bottles. Brace yourself for a crappy day then just be stubborn. He'll figure it out. I would only give him a supplement again if he loses more than 10% of his birth weight and the pediatrician recommends it.<br>  <br>  I gave birth on a Wednesday and my milk didn't come in until Saturday--and some babies need to nurse constantly to build up your supply once it does.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	A ped once told me that most people panic that colostrum isn't enough for their child, but a full feed of colostrum is only 7mls, which is hardly anything. Sometimes it can take a few days for your milk to come in, but until then, colostrum will likely be enough for him. The more you feed or pump (even if it seems like you're not getting anything), the quicker your milk will come in.
J1stiMioaa	no matter how much you want a test to be positive it will only ever be positive if u are pregnant. the earlier u take a test the less reliable it is so u may have just taken the first test too early!<br>  congratulations!|`|J9pIrpkBaa	It's unusual to have a false positive.

yaGR5tr1aa	I am a nurse, but I am answering strictly from personal experience here... <br>   I hated depo.  I hated the spotting, the weight gain, and the unpredictability. When I cam off the depo, it took MONTHS for me to get a period again (11 months), and then I  had very irregular periods following it.  I never knew if I was pregnant or not, which was not a reassuring feeling.<br>   I had been on nuva ring for a year, and LOVED it!! ( I am now pregnant, but only after I got off of it.)   You will not feel the ring inside at all, even during intercourse.  the nuva ring uses the same hormones that you get in a birth control pill, but without having to remember to take a pill every day.  It remains in place for 3 weeks, and then you remove it for 1 week to have your period.  And, it helps reduce breakout, PMS symptoms, bloating, ect.  <br>  I can not give you statistics however on the incidence of becoming pregnant while being on either.|`|gop4Fla9aa	I've been on both so I'll share my personal experiences. With Depo, I gained a ton of weight (about 30 lb), had mood swings, and after I got off it, I didn't have a period for months and months. I personally would never get back on it! Plus, who likes getting stuck with those needles?!<br>  With the NuvaRing, I wasn't really fond of having something 'inside' me and having to do it myself. Side effects included nausea, bloating, gas, and upset stomach. Oh, and horrible headaches! HOWEVER, everyone is different, and that could just be me! Plus, unbeknown to me, I was already pregnant while I was on the Nuvaring! So that could attribute to the nausea and upset stomach. <br>  Good luck to you...I hope you find something that works for you!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	I was on Depo and hated it. I got horrible acne, gained 40 pounds, which would not go away with diet and exercise,. It came off pretty fast after I got off it, though. Plus I had spotting everyday for 3 months when I first got on it. Then no periods, which was cool. I was pretty depressed at points while on it. I definetely don't recommend it. I dont know much about nuva ring, sorry.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I've never tired the nuva ring, but was on depo and hated it. The first two shots of it I had I bled constantly, only stopping for like 2 days at a time, then started back up. Then the 3rd shot I had didn't work and I still got pregnant with my son. There is an increasing number of women getting pregnant on the depo shot, according to my doctor. I would try the nuva ring. I don't want any more children at all so I got the Essure coils put in to block my tubes.|`|HW89eJEZaa	i would suggest another type od bc, i used the nuva ring and i did not like it, it kept falling out and the last time it fell out it fell im the toilet, i threw it out! also the depo shot will screw you up big time, esp. if you plan on having kids later, that stuff is bad news for your body. if you talk to most anyone who had been on the shot, you will hear stories about how it took years to conceive after stopping the shot! ust thought i would let you know, good luck!
a5b42e198900103c6593fc522b1a9354aa	It is very possible, it happened to me on my first pregnancy.     You need to take the test with your 1st morning urine, not in the middle of the afternoon,  1st morning urine is more concentrated and you will be more likely to get an accurate reading.     I made that mistake and that's how I ended up with a negative test and I was indeed pregnant.     Good Luck.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	You can still be pregnant if you took one test and it came back negative. Sometimes the hormone levels aren't high enough yet for the test to detect. Wait a few days and test again to be on the safe side.   I think it is a little early for the constantly hungry symptom and all, but it may be your body's way of warning you that you are pregnant. Like I said wait 3-4 days and take another test. Good luck.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	If you test too early you can get a false positive.  Or if you drink a lot to try to make yourself have to pee to do a test you can get a false positive.  Give yourself a couple of days and try again.  Try to use morning pee.  Look closely, sometimes the line or whatever is very faint early on.  Try not to stress about it because if you're going to get your period stressing may make it late.  Hope u get a + sign.|`|kT7GVOosaa	it is possible for negative tests to appear when you are in fact pregnant. the best time of day to take a test is right when you wake up in the morning. that is when the hormone can be detected the most. good luck!|`|ktdpOM8Maa	It is possible... I would go see your OB/GYN asap to check it out, because if you're not pregnant there could be other things going on.
jG8b3Mz0aa	You'll feel more pressure in your groin area, also you will be able to breathe easier but have to pee more.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	Sometimes you can feel it happen because it feels like someone dropped a brick down inside you. Some women don't know the baby has dropped until their doctor does a pelvic exam and tells them. The doctor had to tell me that my daughter had dropped most of the way down, but I felt her about a week ago when she dropped the rest of the way. Plus my pants are tighter now in the waist and I can breathe better since she isn't right up there pushing on my lungs.|`|kT7GVOosaa	you should be able to tell just by looking at your belly. when your baby has dropped you can see it a lot lower then it has ever been.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	It will feel like the babies head is right on your pelvic bones down there. When you walk, it will feel like the babies head is SO low. It gets uncomfortable. Plus, your belly will look lower.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	The baby must be head down first.  You can tell when it is head down by where you feel the strongest movements.  If the baby is head down you will feel the strongest movements below your rib cage (the legs kicking).  When it actually drops it usually becomes more difficult to walk (e.g. waddling) and you will feel the pressure down there.  You will know.    37 w 1 d mine has not dropped.|`|AA11981363	You will know it! you could even pee your pants a bit LOL Congratulations!|`|QT5ROElraa	I think there is a difference between the baby "moving down" and "dropping down". When I was 34 weeks the baby moved down like 4 inches. Everyone commented on it, and I thought I might have him soon! No such luck ;-(. Anyhow a week or so ago the baby dropped down, and it felt like his head was wedged between my hips, and he was Right on my bladder practically smooshing it. It makes u waddle to walk, because u'r hips are slightly pushed apart, and u want to pee constantly, and u can feel the baby on ur bladder if u lean forwards.
8WRnqs08aa	The myth I've heard is that if you a pregnant with the same sex child, then the already born child will act up.    This rang true for me during my last pregnancy. I was pregnant with my daughter who is now 7 months. My niece, who was 2 at the time, all of a sudden decided that she didn't want anything to do with her auntie (me). She'd run away from me screaming, wouldn't come near me, wouldn't let me talk to her, hug her, pick her up...nothing! She didn't come back around until I was almost due & she realized that auntie was having a baby.    Now, my sister watches my baby while I work part time. My niece loves my baby to pieces...they're gonna be Best Friends growing up - it's cute!    Maybe you're pregnant with another boy or he's just aproaching his terrible 2's - Best Wishes!|`|eV5E9MhUaa	probably just because he's a toddler.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Not true...lol.  I have had a 2 year old and they do that whether you are pregnant or not.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	I've heard that.  My son started acting up when I got pregnant with my daughter and my mil said that.  It's an old wive's tale, but I guess it wouldn't be an old wive's tale if it wasn't right some of the time.  ;)|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	If I was pregnant for everytime my son throws a fit I'd have wayyyyyy to many children.|`|OtbbKdITaa	I've heard it before, but it's just an old wives tale. If you want to know if you're pregnant, take a pregnancy test. If you are, please let us know if the old wives tale was accurate. It will be very interesting if it is - as those can sometimes be.|`|nX2pSke8aa	fact.  they  will  grow  out  of  it.  it  take's  time  just  bare   with  it.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Our son really started acting wild about 7-8 weeks ago, and then I discovered we were pregnant. I personally believe they can sense a change in mommy, and can sense the pregnancy, much like how animals can sense danger.    Though he has calmed down and is sweet as pie again, I personally believe the myth.
UiXJLrDWaa	5 days after your missed period|`|vue9NOhYaa	You would test if/when your period is late.    In the meantime, if this just happened in the past few days, get down to Planned Parenthood and get PlanB.|`|hZWup7xXaa	well it depends on the pregnancy test, you can get some that can be used up to 6 days before your expected period but they would be more effective if you use it closer to your expected period. just try not to stress over it as that usually makes more girls feel like they are pregnant even when they are not. hope this helps and good luck :)|`|AA10038269	about 3 days after your missed period|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	wait until a few days after your period was due.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	If your period doesn't come you can take a test the day it is due.  If it is negative and it still doesn't come wait a few days and take another test.  You'll get best results if you use first morning urine.
916b9f2e50839abb51e314ab19c8258eaa	I'm not sure if she's had her appointment yet, but some women can feel lower abdominal pain in pregnancy because the ligaments supporting the uterus begin to stretch. This makes them ache. I hope she's okay and if he intentionally hurt her, she needs to get out.|`|8WRnqs08aa	She needs to be checked by a medical professional to rule out placenta previa or miscarriage.    Good Luck & so sorry for her abuse.|`|IyLp4Klwaa	I agree she does need to be checked out straight away! Take her to the doctor NOW!!!|`|V2r0HRKjaa	There is a chance or it could just be pain to her and not harm the baby.

tx2gvd43aa	My husband also has Blue Cross and Blue Shield of NE and it pays for all of our ultrasounds. I don't know if you have the same plan as us, but it covers all prenatal visits 100%. I hope that this helps you with your question!|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I believe that most do.  We have Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO CCPOA and It payed for all of mine.  We only had to pay 1 $15 co-pay the whole pregnancy!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Yes,my mom has blue cross blue shield when she was pregnant with me and my brother.they only covered 1 ultrasound back then tho.|`|UiXJLrDWaa	yes it should|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I have BC/BS of Texas and the co-pay covers my routine ultrasounds.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	If there are no complications they usually will only pay for the one at 18-20 weeks. If there are complications or a question of conception date they will pay for anything medically necessary. Something you can do is get the CPT code and diagnosis code from your Dr each time there is an ultrasound ordered. Then call BCBS with that info and they will tell you 100% if it will be covered. I did billing for a hospital and Dr's office for 6 years.|`|AA10315542	It is impossible to tell whether certain procedures are covered just because you say "BCBS NE".  Your insurance company (BCBS NE) supplies insurance to hundreds of companies and individuals.  Each one of these groups have "customized plans".      So, say your insurance is through your employer, your employer may have chosen to exclude ultrasounds (just an example) to save money on the premiums.  Another employer may have more money and choose to have ultrasounds covered.     Bottom line, you need to look at your plan booklet, and/or call the customer service phone number on your insurance card.
XDQNxzw1aa	Even though he's pulled out every time, men still release little bits of sperm during intercourse.  Unfortunately, there is no 100% effective way to prevent pregnancy when sexually active.    While some women have periods (shorter or regular) while pregnant, keep in mind these could be symptoms of something else.  I'd talk to a doctor about them and see what s/he has to say.    Even if you're on the pill or using a condom, you can still be pregnant.  Take a pregnancy test.  If it's positive, go to a doctor to confirm the pregnancy.  Good luck!|`|z4byzsGLaa	Men do pre-ejaculate!!! I would take a test and I would say if your not on birth control then you very well could be pregnant!|`|WxEmrNAOaa	the 'pull out' method is not a form of contraception. you are probably pregnant, you have got all the signs. buy a pregnancy test.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	If your sex has been unprotected I would definetly take a test and find out for sure. The pull out method isn't always effective. Its probably too early to be having pregnancy symptoms such as morning sickness. Take a test soon. good luck.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	You could go get a blood test at planned parenthood, or your local clinic just in case. But using the pull out method is NOT a smart thing to do. If you must be sexually active, use a condom. My mother always told me... when your mature enough to walk into the store and buy your own condoms, and tell me your sexually active your mature enough to have sex. I DOUBT you can do either of those things.|`|hZWup7xXaa	it does sound like you are pregnant but just calm down and take a test. and i hope you do know that the pull out method does not work what so ever. he still precomes and yes it is possible to get pregnant from it. if the test comes back negative and you still think you are pregnant then go to your doctor for a quick blood test. hope this helps and good luck :)|`|aJTBF7opaa	pulling out is not birth control, you can still get pregnant. You also can still get a period the first 1-3 months of pregnancy. Take a test if you aren't satisfied with the results then go see your dr. It sounds like you could be, but every women is different and sometimes symptoms such as can be caused by other things.|`|NxyTBTMvaa	precum can get you pregnant and if you dont know what that is ...its the little bit of sperm that comes out before he ejaculates. and it only takes one out of your four to get pregnant expecialy if your not using protection meaning condoms and birth controle condoms are the most efficiant way of course birth control being the back up . and when you say "periods" how many have you had in the last month because you might want to talk to your doctor about that and the pain in you breasts could becuase of your period/periods and the best way to find out if your pregnant is to take the test.
bTlhBX3daa	It's typical for a pregnant woman to run a few degree's warmer than normal as we are acting as an incubator. But you might want to tell your Dr. just in case. Anytime your body gets overheated (should not get above about 100 degree's when pregnant), your amniotic fluid heats up, and even after you cool down, it takes another 45 minutes for the fluid to cool, so the baby is just sitting in the hot fluid.     For me, I noticed that my belly usually seems cool to the touch compared to the rest of my body. I even had a dream one night that my cousins wife was pregnant and she called it "The Freeze" LOL.|`|ioZeveazaa	It sounds normal. Tell your doctor though. There is ALOT of blood flowing through that area and alot going on so this is more than likely the reason for the warmness. Good luck!
4p9sBdyTaa	No, he is being selfish to expect you to do what he wants even though it makes you uncomfortable, this is a experience you have to go through and you should be made as comfortable as possible.|`|cjKPEHaFaa	Hell no, you're not being selfish!!  That's your body, and if you're not comfortable with it, then don't let that camera near you!  I'm letting my husband in the delivery room with me, but he's under strict orders to stay by my head the entire time and not even peak down there!|`|707gOCvbaa	No. But once you are on that table the last thing you are thinking about is pooping. Just go with the flow and allow him to experience the birth his way. I'm not sure it would make a great movie to eat dinner to but you'll cherish the memory later in life. Congrats Mommy.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	No, that doesn't make you selfish, but realize it IS a normal part of childbirth.|`|P9C6VTseaa	No, not at all. Hospitals used to give women enemas before delivering so that there was no possibility of this. Enemas are a debated practice nowadays but you can probably still request one prior to delivery. Talk to your doctor.    I think the real question is, are you comfortable having the delivery taped? You're the one going through the physical ordeal, if you don't want a video camera there, say so.
kZRTekoJaa	my daughter is 16 months old and when i catch her doing something she shouldn't be doing she runs. or if i tell her "no" she (usually) stops b/c she is aware of what is right and wrong when it comes to things i have already disciplined her on. so at your daughter's ages they know what is ok for them to do or not, concerning anything you've explained to them in the past.  however they are too young to just come to the conclusion that something is not ok to do, if it's a first time experience for them. and kids get excited and forget and slip up at that age as well.. they still know better they just forget sometimes b/c they're human.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	Absolutely.  My daughter is only 22 months and she knows what she should and shouldn't touch and that she should hit or yell.  Now whether or not she will listen is a different story.  She does test her boundaries and she get's told firmly no and get taken away from the situation and put in a time out chair for all of 2 minutes.  I have noticed a difference.  It is very repetitive and you HAVE to be consistent.  But babies and toddlers are so incredibly smart and they understand long before they can talk.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Yes, they should know what the word "no" means, and you should tell them why they should not behave in a certain manner.  Get down on there level, to where they can understand what you are saying.
S1gJJHNzaa	12-48 hours after your first positive.. don't stress i get positives up to 6 days straight some cycles.. not a big deal just a strong lh surge.|`|RPszYGXkaa	I haven't gotten a positive OPK for that long b/c the instructions on my test say to stop once you get a positive, so I don't test after that,    I would think it happened on 1/31 or 2/1 based on your OPK and your cervical fluid    Days look good, sperm can live for a few days, and if you did O on 2/1, the egg may have still been viable for fertilization on 2/2.    I am just starting to track my bbt and cervical fluid this month and I am on my TWW (7 DPO)...but I have used opk's, but without luck, which is why I am charting now in addition to opks.    Baby dust and best wishes!|`|1Qvt2vtqaa	I get around 5-6 positive OPK every month.     I think you ovulated the 1 or 2 of Feb based on the 24-36 hours in the instruction of the OPK.    I think you BD in the right time given that sperm can live up to 5 days and the egg up to 24 hours.    No, I haven't gotten pregnant the first time. I'm on my 3th month using OPK.    Hope this helps.

kZRTekoJaa	unless YOU have proof that he is "firing blanks" then i wouldn't believe him.  however if he really has been tested and been determined to be "firing blanks" then no, you can not get pregnant unless whatever causing his "blanks" to be "blanks" changes (for example if a vasectomy were reversed..)  sex feels better for guys without a condom on, so naturally some guys will lie about their sterility to convince you to not use a condom. be careful who you trust!|`|AA11327039	Unless he's gizzed into a cup at least TWO times several months apart from one another and sent the sample off to a lab and both times the sample comes back ZERO sperm count, then you can get pregnant|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	It sounds like your bf could be telling porkie pies!

If you meant that your bf told you that he fires blanks, and your asking if that means you can't get pregnant.     A. If he really is firing blanks than yeah you can't get pregnant.     B. How do you trust that your bf is telling the truth. Guys say stuff that ain't true. So you might be pregnant. Use condoms please|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	hes not firing blanks at all. you can still get pregnant. he has to be lying to you. he just says that so he can cover his tracks and find a different guy that won't lie to you !|`|S5n5Za78aa	use a condom and/or BC to avoid pregnancy if you dont wish to be pregnant dont ever take take those words even if its confirmed by a doc cause docs can  be wrong too!!   but go get a HPT asap|`|djlA8Wpdaa	he has been LYING to you! get a test,and a better bf.|`|JBsilBYXaa	Do you have proof that he is telling you the truth?  Sometimes even if a man does 'fire blanks' a woman can still get pregnant for some random reason.|`|blzFIxcUaa	Of cause you can get pregnant.    You just need a new boyfriend.|`|ZadOtSlOaa	I've heard that one before. He's just lying so you don't make him put on a condom. Dump him, he's a jerk. That's what I did and I never regretted it.|`|uCdpqmSqaa	Guys LIE.|`|QV6swGUMaa	no it just means it is harder to get pregnant.but still possible|`|b10aMPdOaa	My hubby was told this years ago when he was in another relationship, she couldn't get pregnant.  Guess what, I gave birth 3 months ago and also lost twins in July 2007.  So....  if I was you I'd take no notice or ask him to get checked out again and you go with him.  Take the test and proove to him you are pregnant, then he will have to deal with it.|`|qImMwhUHaa	The only reason he would fire blanks is if he's had a vasectomy . Has he had one of those??? If not then yes you can get pregnant.|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	No there is ALWAYS a possibility of getting pregnant if a man and a woman are having sex and he has balls and she has a womb. My friend was told she would never get pregnant, 2 months later she was.|`|0XFV6iswaa	It means you can't get pregnant until just before he says "oops". Welcome to single motherhood.|`|oo8ykumQaa	Hi. Seems like most people who have replied have not been particularly helpful and instead have attempted to slag your boyfriend off. Anyway, guys CAN be infertile, just like women can, therefore his sperm may indeed be no good. If you're worried you might be pregnant, go to your doctors and get checked, or do a home pregnancy test and tell your boyfriend because he may happily go to the doctors with you and he could perhaps get checked out too so you both know once and for all if he is infertile. Hope that helps!
BnR4LLhxaa	Why don't you talk to your obstetrician about this? There is no way that anyone on this site can answer your question with any confidence.|`|UgcPxd4maa	do you have a OB? im sure you'll get an ultrasound!|`|HIZ1G175aa	go get an ultrasound they can show you if you are or not
150esu4Daa	Don't listen to all the negative posts! I think you should just talk to him about it. next time he says something just ask him if he is serious about having kids possibly in the future. And tell him straight up that you don't want kids, or if you are not comfortable with that try dropping some subtle hints about not wanting children. I appreciate your honestly in asking this question, ignore the haters! :) Good luck!|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Sounds like pillow talk to me.    Edit:  I'm not sure why I got a thumbs down.  I wasn't being ugly.  I was just saying that if he is saying that he wants to "let it go in my area" that it is just a heat-of-the-moment thing.|`|6yRyAA5Laa	i think y0u sh0uld have 0ne.a b0y.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	If you cant even use the proper terms for things, I doubt you are ready to have a baby.  Neither of you.  Get on BCP asap    EDIT - If you are 25, then you should be very aware of the fact that comments like that, from someone that age, are more likely of a serious nature.  If neither of you wanted a child, you would be using some form of protection in the first place.  If he wants a child, and is serious about it, you need to be having a chat with him about your future, and the potential family you will be bringing into this world|`|PPqQ7yuDaa	Girl don't worry about the haters.  But he might be serious. And that is just his biological clock ticking away.  But you should sit down with him and let him know where you are at in your life and you are not ready for a baby just yet.  and let him see the pros and cons of having a baby at the state you are in.  (meaning you might want to establish yourself more career wise)  But just talk to him and be open about it.  Don't forget Birth control is 99% effective so if he is ejaculating up in you 24/7 you might get pregnant.  Good luck and forget the a**holes comments that are negative.|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	sounds like  he  is being serious about it, but maybe call him on it or sit him down and ask him. Since you are both old enough he should be able  to act maturely about it. Have you two discussed your views on this, is it that you don't want any kids ever or just none at this present time.What are his views with out acting in a joking manner. Its hard to tell with out hearing how he is saying  it and the tone of voice that he is using If you haven't discusses this already I would suggest that you do because this will help to clear the air. Just make sure to use a back up method if you don't want kids because birth control is never 100% effective and it can fail sometimes. Also remember this can be an important thing in both of your futures you could run into some major road blocks if he wants kids and you don't. Good luck|`|qImMwhUHaa	If you don't want any kids then I hope you're on birth control.|`|Qp79sBF7aa	If you don't want any kids, why aren't you using protection?  Just ask him.  If he is your boyfriend hopefully you talk to him.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	How old are you? You sound so YOUNG. Stop having unprotected sex before you DO get pregnant!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I dunno. Sounds like he may want a baby. but if you don't, definetly get on some form of birth control. It will certainly happen if you guys keep having sex and not being protected.|`|tmIFbL8aaa	ura whore and deserve an STD if you don't want kids DON'T HAVE SEX!

Mira debes tú buscar información sobre la sexualidad, la tenemos desde antes de nacer, si lo dices porque la haz visto masturbarse, no pasa nada, si puede ser muy da?ina tu reacción, la masturbación es normal, todo ser humano desde que descubre sus genitales, sentimos placer el manipularlos, busca orientación tú y revisa por que te asusta la sexualidad de tu hija, si se masturba, es como el placer al orinar o saciar alguna necesidad, solo que esta la debes educar a que es en privado, con las manitas limpias; ahora te digo algo más, cuando la masturbación compulsiva en una ni?a o ni?o, al igual que un adulto, puede deberse a soledad o ansiedad, es importante que la mantengas ocupada, que se sienta amada y acompa?ada, y así respetes su intimidad, solo explicale que puede tener una infección si no tiene las manos limpias, al igual que le puede ocurrir si manipula sus ojitos con las manos sucias; no te asustes, no hagas que ella te tenga desconfianza o miedo, amala, acompa?ala, todos sus problemas son tan importantes que los de un adulto, toda proporción guardada.|`|ec22f1ab044da3bc59772d04a2adbaadaa	platicar que su cuerpo y su sexualidad  van sufriendo cambios y que ella va a ir descubriendo cosas nuevas pero que siempre debe tener en cuenta el respeto  y la privacidad.<br>  es imposible ocultarles tantas cosas con la información que dan actualmente los medios.<br>  comunicación mucha comunicación.|`|338e5a80458005802c2145d48740ad23aa	explicale con pelos y se?ales cómo se practica el sexo e igual le da un poco de asco, por aquello que de ni?os para los chicos las chicas son "el enemigo" y viceversa...|`|342ed5dd12fcf19f831be8ef6f574c27aa	es mejor no hacerle caso, todos los ni?os sienten deseo sexual pero no es ke lo sientan es ke en kuanto les roza algo por sus partes y notan que les gusta lo hacen mas veces porque es algo que acaban de descubrir pero lo mejor que hay que hacer es pasar no le debes ni rega?ar ni reir sus gracias, hay que ignorar la situación, porque luego cuando son mayores pueden piyar un trauma e la msma vergüenza, lo se porque lo e leido en el libro de la sexologa olga bertome ai viene todo esto|`|44032df4712a6c0ff949251c2585969baa	Bueno esto es algo normal, 1o que todo no lo tomes como algo grave, porque es + común de lo que crees, ahora lo importante, es que sepas enfocarlo y ense?arle a la ni?a a superar esta situción.<br>   El entorno está demasiado erotisado, quizás en vuestra casa se ven esas telenovelas, o series nocturnas, que a los grandes no nos da nada, pero que en los ni?os va creando un caldo de cultivo, donde el amor se relaciona siempre con el sexo, donde las chicas bonitas son las que tienen + curvas, + poder sobre los hombres, son queridas y admiradas por todos... quizás tu hija sólo quiere eso atención y lo enfoca, como lo ve en la tv. <br>  Otra cosa, sería que ella ha sido manoseada por algun adulto u otro ni?o mayor y le gustado... espero que esto, sea erróneo, pero deberías ponerte en todos los casos, llevala al pediatra para que le haga un reconocimiento fisico y descarte lo que te he dicho... y que te la derive a un psicologo infantil, que te ayude a superar este incidente, porque si no lo supera puede traerte consecuencias en la etapa más conflictiva LA ADOLESCENCIA.

Las ni?as de mi clase también veían esas revistas y parecián excitarse con fotos de hombres. Sin embargo era solo eso, ver fotos, nada mas.<br>  Creo que en cuanto a si es anormal, solo un profecional podría responderte, y no tengo dudas de que debe ser por influencia de sus compa?eros y compa?eras de clase. Yo lo que haría en tu caso es ense?arle lo bello del amor, de la amistad, de ayudar a lo demás, para que se de cuenta de lo lindo que son esas cosas, que el sexo no es lo mas importante en la vida. Y porque no ence?arle también de sexualidad (no digo relaciones sexuales, sino sexualidad), hablalé de los cambios que va a sufrir o que quizás ya está sufriendo (mi tia tuvo su primera menstruación a los 8 a?os), y de que el sexo no es un simple juego, que se requiere responsabilidad y madures mental para realizarlo (y según creo yo, amor, no se si tu estas de acuerdo), y que ella todavía no tiene esa madures, que tiene mucho que aprender. Eso si, NUNCA LE REPRIMAS ESO, ni la retes o le digas que está mal, como dicen por ahí, lo único que lograras es crear mas curiosidad en ella por eso (a mi me paso), y lo mas grave, ella sentirá en el futuro miedo y verguenza de hablar de eso con tigo (porque justamente tu le dijiste que eso esta mal), y eso es lo peor que le puede ocurrir, es horrible para un ni?o o ni?a cuando te pasa algo (un dolor en los genitales por ejemplo), no poder decirselo a sus padres por miedo o verguenza a hablar de eso, imagina que ese dolor sea un tumor maligno y que por miedo o verguenza no te lo diga...|`|bff2ace0364fefdef7a75e78bacb67f0aa	creo que primero que nada para ti que es deseo sexual que se agarra eso no es deseo o te hace preguntas tampoco se ve su parte tampoco deseo es cuando buscas una pareja y la buscas con un deseo sexual ese es deseo creo que si es eso necesita ayuda urgente|`|d19a74b19995fa266c0e6c705a9d4437aa	No lei todas las respuestas pero esa d METERLE MIEDO? en q cabeza cabe?! x eso luegoo terminan como terminan,El mejor modo es hablar con los ni?os,y si siente deseos,pues no he sabido d eso,mi primera relación fue a esa edad,pero nor ecuerdo haber sentido deseos.|`|7b9e3d186683ff9fc0b5ca8ac5335d66aa	consulta a un medico|`|ac2439f94168458accd2126312865b9eaa	es comun que se desarrolle este deseo cuando los factores o circunstancias de su realidad lo dispongan, revisa el medio donde se desarrolla y encontraras una causa razonable|`|c3d567cad9058823045714c94f09a70faa	lo primero es llevarla a un medico por que eso esta fuera de lugar todo en la vida tiene su edad y ella no esta para pensar en eso otra cosa que te recomendaria es que estes muy al tanto de con quien juega o de lo que esta pasando en tu casa por que casi seguro que ella esta viendo cosas que la estan exitando, o talves visita en casas quepasan cosas  y ella las esta viendo, tienes que estar muy alerta porque algo malo esta pasando con ella y eso la puede afectar por toda la vida al medico primero y los ojos bien alertas por que algo esta pasando|`|cb0c4b8cd9e0d9fed2ceda19e9d8cc77aa	Vamonos por partes, una cosa es curiosidad sexual y otro muy grande deseo sexual, en una ni?a de ocho a?os la primera es normal pero no la segunda noooo! por favor!!!<br>  Te recomiendo busques quien las oriente a las 2, debe ser un profesional.

Then my boobs got all sensitive and I started feeling sick to my stomach.|`|d76896e1e64297132e8d96add00f5f7daa	I knew with my first because I didn't have my period...we were trying to get pg... she made me so sick that I could NOT cook raw meat.. I hated the smell of it...<br>  <br>  With the second... I knew when I was a week pg, becuase the morning sickness was SOO bad..|`|1d9cab93866af158d821a88be8d8b72caa	My husband and I were told that we couldn't have any children after 8 1/2 years of trying we just gave up. I decided to go on a diet with co-workers and while on this diet I gained 1 pound and was so mad that I gain that one pound. I didn't think any thing until I was with my girlfriend shopping and I was get hot and cold flashes and she mentioned to me that I may be pregnant. She knew and I knew that I couldn't be. About another week passed on and I still didn't have my period but that was not unusal for me because I had unregular periods. I was about 2 weeks late when my one girlfriend said that I should take a pregnacy test. We both laughed about it but I did and it was positive. I called the fertility clinic and they drew me up a blood test to make sure I was and that afternoon they called me back and said I was!  Then in 2 1/2 years later I got pregnant with my second child and then 2 1/2 years later I got pregnant with my third child. With the last two pregnancies I was tired and very sick....(girls) with My first one being a  boy and I never had any morning sickness or any trouble with that pregnancy.|`|1df7ed9cf05dbb0b85c2a80a3effbe59aa	All of my pregnancies I was tired and my boobs swelled and were really tender.  If you are only a week from your period, take a home pregnancy test.  With both of my kids and with my miscarriage I knew I was pregnant before I ever missed my period.|`|4e444f799d721ca5d441d517489c6c28aa	how old are you?|`|626a592ea611af0b928d723dd3d403e6aa	In all honesty, we had been trying to get pregnant for almost a year. I had given up completely on the idea, when one morning my 4 year old stepson who had climbed into bed with me the night before rolled over in his sleep and said"I want a little brother"<br>  And then rolled back over. 3 days later on New Years Eve I took a pregnancy test before we went out. Sure enough...I was pregnant. On April 12th though my son was very upset when the lady doing the ultrasound said "its a girl" He said.."uh...but I want abrother" and did not talk to me for almost an hour. (he's very excited now though. My due date is the 22nd)<br>  But since I got way off the purpose of your question...I didn't have any symptoms until I was almost 8.5 weeks. Then I just got horrible headaches and an upset tummy every single day about 7 pm. (Now I have every symptom that I should've showed then)\<br>  Good Luck and Congrats if you are!!|`|1811e97781470af7e1cd7a9dedaed4efaa	I realized with my first one that I was pregnant when I took those pills that give you energy (i don't remember what they were called) but my breasts started to itch really badly.  That's how I figured out my first one.  My second one, I was using the basal temperature thing, when my temp rose, i knew  i was pregnant. As for my third, I had a really weird period and told my husband on New Years Day i was pregnant and yes i was.  As for my fourth I had no clue. and with my fifth it was because i missed my period.|`|AA11948469	well...with my first one...I KNEW....even the doctor said i wasn't, came back 4 days later and it was positive.<br>  <br>  the second one, i wasn't paying attention.<br>  <br>  this third one....i had been having nightmares about my kids and water. i woke up (i hadn't even missed my period yet) took a test and wala! it was positive. <br>  <br>  STOP STRESSING!!! stressing is another factor for not getting periods. calm down. you will know in a few days

d76896e1e64297132e8d96add00f5f7daa	NINE EARLY SIGNS OF PREGNANCY<br>  Soon after you suspect that you're pregnant, your body will confirm your suspicions. While the symptoms differ in each woman, here are nine early signs of pregnancy: <br>  <br>  1. Fatigue – you no longer have stamina for usual activities, such as walking up a hill or staying awake until midnight. This is because your body is demanding huge amounts of energy to make the changes for pregnancy. <br>  <br>  2. Nausea and vomiting – morning sickness may be confused with the flu or feeling like you're "coming down with something." You may feel queasy, have nausea all day long, or vomit and have dry heaves. (See Morning Sickness) <br>  <br>  3. Missed menstrual period. While nonpregnancy-related issues, such as stress, can cause you to miss a period, this is a first sign of pregnancy, too. <br>  <br>  4. Slight staining or spotting. Bleeding at the time of implantation can be mistaken for menstruation. Some women have bleeding in the early months of pregnancy at the time when they would have menstruated. <br>  <br>  5. Aversions to odors, alcohol, and smoke. Once you are pregnant, baby-protective mechanisms click in. You will notice how coffee, alcohol, and cigarette smoke make you ill. <br>  <br>  6. Food cravings. Once you become pregnant, you may mysteriously crave foods that you seldom ate before. Your tastes may change from sweet to salty or vice versa. <br>  <br>  7. Breast changes. The changes are similar to premenstrual feelings in your breasts only more dramatic: nipples tingle, breasts feel tender and fuller, the areola begins to darken, and tiny glands on the areola enlarge. <br>  <br>  8. Crampy pelvic discomfort. This discomfort may be felt throughout the lower abdomen and pelvis. (A sharp one-sided pain is not normal and your doctor should be notified.) <br>  <br>  9. Frequent urination. From the beginning, you will urinate more often due to pregnancy hormones. (Later on, you will have frequent urination because of pressure on the bladder from the enlarging uterus.)|`|32d74696e9412c180a3928d4de44da96aa	Not sure what the earliest sign of pregnancy would be, but yes you can still get your period if you are pregnant|`|AA10823493	go get a ept. And that should tell you. Go to the Dr. But if you don't want to get pregnant just don't have sex or use some protection.|`|AA11760917	yes its possible....that happened to my friend.|`|a6da8df2007ffa3ff5b888b676c33133aa	Usually one of the first signs of early pregnancy would be a skipped period.  Though it is less common to bleed normally and still  be pregnant it is possible.  If you are just spotting, very light bleeding it is a definite possibility.  The only way to know for your is have a pregnancy test.  If you purchase one yourself use you first morning urine as that would have the most HCG the pregnancy hormone in it.  A blood test that your doctor can perform in his office is very reliable.  Other early signs could be breast tenderness, nausea, frequent urination, and pulling sensations on the sides of your lower abdomen while turning over in bed etc.  Good luck.|`|AA11210405	Oh my gosh...this question gets asked about 1,000 times a day, everyday....It worries me to see all these woman asking all of these basic questions about their bodies and their cycles….and then getting all these different answers – and usually most of these answers are WRONG! <br>  This is my standard answer......... go get a book called Taking Charge of your fertility by Toni Weschler. It will help you understand your body and all the myths about it. It will help you time when you are ovulating and the best times to conceive. My Doctor recommended it to me and after 1 year of trying I got the book. It worked the very next month. It turns out that my timing was wrong due to mis-information. I hope it helps you, too! It's not only about getting pregnant. It's about knowing your body and knowing when you are fertile or not. You can pick and choose what you do with your info. Good luck and don't listen the all the myths!|`|ddbbc19551a86b2d1395fc2e1ab1f6ffaa	No it's not possible to have your period while your pregnant, but some pregnant women experience "bleeding". I'm not sure about "earliest signs, but I think you could get tested a lot earlier before the signs come.
JcGEEDTMaa	haha well did you take the test?  <br>  My four year old started pointing at my belly before we knew we were having a baby and said stuff like "a baby's in there" and "when's the baby coming?" .  My cat also became real clingy and laying on my tummy and purring a lot.  <br>  I say take the test.  it's possible.  unless your toddler just really wants a baby brother or sister and is pretending or something.|`|AA11705676	well my little guy is being a total grouch, so i took the test and sure enough. he's only 3 1/2 but he's been very clingy. i'm only about 7 weeks and he dosent want me to leave. he wakes up and cries for me not to come to work. every night he wants to sleep with me. and last week when i told him i had a baby in my tummy he told me he wanted to step on it. idk, but i think they know|`|HTzVyeYyaa	there is a certain level of intuition in everyone. Unfortunately, as we get older, we put up walls so we end up losing a lot of that perceptiveness.  She probably knows and i would definately take the test.|`|6EenztwDaa	toddlers can be very smart... its probably true|`|AA12251362	Pregnant women get a vibe and a smell about them that others can "detect."

Its the unhappy people that do it to make themselves feel better.

Have you tried getting your parents to talk to his parents? Is he always with a group of friends? If he isnt then have you tried saying "hey can we talk about this"?

CxRJwJsraa	Maeve, I love Maeve.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	Can I choose neither?<br>  Charity is too cliche, and Maeve isn't very pretty|`|U1juqahIaa	Maeve.  It's a classic Irish/Gaelic name and sounds more professional than Charity.

AA11138222	I LOVE Sophie Elizabeth. It's a classic, beautiful name. I don't like Kami at all, it looks funny to me, like it's only part of a name or something.

CdJtH0xdaa	Take your mind off her by doing something you like. Ride a bike, write, watch television. Just try not to do stuff that reminds you of her, because then you'll get more angry. I've lost A LOT of good friends because of dumb stuff like that, and I did stuff I loved. I hung out with other friends and did stuff I loved, and I got my mind off of him like that. Good luck.|`|PZbiNiuTaa	For one thing hate is a very strong word. Obviously she abused your friendship but you shouldn't end it because of a mistake. If you do that every time a friend crosses the line you won't have anyone left by the time your 30. Talk to her about it because it is obviously bothering you and you care about her. Talking about it will help you find closure in the situation.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	Haha i had the same problem ... but i hated her for other reasons.... [[basically she came after me punching at me cause i told her to relax]][[she has a has a bad temper]] anyways we both got suspended ... for 2 days ... cause i managed to while i was blocking her punches ... slap her [[no she didn't hit me even once]] What i did was ... i didn't talk about it to others ... unless they brought it up. And if your not talking about it keep your mind on other things .... like your work lol ... now its a few months later ... and i rarely think of her ... minus when i see her in the halls .... but theres nothing you can do about that.|`|I8O1vhRqaa	um, well justget your mind off it by doing some fun things <br>  listen to some music and stufff :/|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Do things you enjoy.<br>  <br>  Just go about your life and before it you wont even be thinking about here anymore.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	This happened to me before; even though I was no longer with a friend anymore, I kept thinking about them.

Pensaba que porqué me tenía que tocar a mi...me dieron las explicaciones médicas y me alentaron para que lo intentara de nuevo, pero seguía perdiendo mis bebés. Con cada pérdida me sentía frustrada, triste y confundida, sola, muy sola, porque, a pesar de tener a mi esposo, nadie puede sentir el vacío que se nos queda dentro cuando esa vida ya no está. Después de un a?o y medio encontraron la solución médica a mi problema y hoy estoy embarazada de trece semanas...estoy feliz, los abortos no se me olvidan pero esta nueva vida sí que me hace olvidar la tristeza que sentí y pensar que es la primera vez que me embarazo...vas a ver como el tiempo te ayuda, y cuando tengas un hijo se te va a pasar del todo. Para reponerme tardé como 10 días hasta que terminé de sangrar y luego me hicieron una ecografía para ver que todo estuviera o.k.. Te cuento que es una desgracia, pero es muy común que el primer embarazo se pierda, es como un ensayo del cuerpo femenino para alojar mejor a un futuro bebé...Un gran beso, mucho ánimo, lo superarás.|`|69cd816e89873835dc222c79c8fe2a79aa	tuve 2 abortos , el primero fue espontaneo el segundo tuve mi bebe muerto en mi vientre casi un mes. puedo entenderte parece que ya nada tiene sentido y ves pasar la vida a un costado de ti ,PEROOOO, todo pasa , necesitas tiempo para llorar y llorar esto es necesario para volver a comenzar. no dices nada si te hicieron el legrado, esto es fundamental para que no tengas infecciones en el utero y puedas volver a embarazarte. estoy segura que tu angelito esta en el cielo junto a los mios y algun dia los conoceremos. comienza de nuevo si es necesario tambien con tu pareja. SIEMPRE vuelve a empezar aunque no sea facil.?sabes una cosa? despues de esto Dios me dio un hijo hermoso y todo aquello tan tragico que nos paso, ya quedo atras. Ya veras que esto pasara. te mando un gran abraso!!!!!|`|ed0dd5c578ae47124c7c80e8644eba2daa	Yo pase por eso perdí un embarazo de 4 meses y se como se siente pero ya se te va a pasar el doctor me dijo que el bebe tenia mal formación y por eso sucedió no me gusta hablar mucho de esto por que aun me duele yo estaba super ilusionada.

1e1b1b7afe5b4468e705d72e27192b9caa	Como 1o medida, les aconsejo que un diu se lo pongan en un buen lugar y que utilicen el importado, no traten de ponerselo en un hospital donde lo hacen con el industrial, porque pueden tener todos esos problemas que uds nombraron...<br>  Igual les aviso, que muchas de uds se piensan que se ponen el diu y ya se olvidaron y no es asi, al contrario, deben ir a control cada 6 meses para controlarlo, cambiarlo cada 2 o 3 a?os, y tambien deben controlar el peso, si aumentan mas de 5 kg o bajan mas de 5, lo mas probable es que el diu se los tengan que cambiar, ya que no solo engordamos o adelgazamos por fuera sino tambien por dentro... y esto hace que que el diu quede flojo y puedan quedar embarazadas igual, o se caiga, o si engordaron y esta muy apretado que tengan hemorragias...<br>  Les aconsejo que elijan un buen lugar para su colocacion, vayan a los controles y se pesen de vez en cuando <br>  Saludos :)|`|146357dd4cc41ba27b9319be3db80c26aa	Me imagino que te refieres al DIU???  siendo así te comento que cada organismo es diferente, en mi caso yo lo uso como  anticonceptivo y me ha funcionado muy bien, lo tuve puesto 6 a?os, me lo retiré para tener mi segundo bebé, y despues me lo volví a colocar ya llevo 5 a?os con él y no me causa molestia alguna, sin embargo es importante que cuando te lo coloquen vayas a que te revisen al  menos 2 veces después para asegurarte que tu cuerpo lo haya aceptado, que no se haya movido y no esté causandote ningún problema. <br>  Posteriormente cada que te hagas el papanicolao generalmente lo revisa tu ginecologo.<br>  Tengo entendido que debes cambiartelo de preferencia cada 6 a?os.<br>  En mi caso yo lo siento más practico que tomar pastillas (soy muy olvidadiza) o inyectarme  (le tengo pavor a las inyecciones)|`|3e415e365038bd0a7a16fd7cd599b07faa	Hesas cosas no te hacen efecto al contrario le da más fuerza al feto y encima te hacen da?o a voz.

67d6b270cfa513dfec09035d29a99393aa	I find its better to get out of bed everyday rather than staying in and ending up with bedsores.. :)     No really though you should be able to find joy/reason to get out of bed everyday. Sometimes I love that I have to get up early just so I can watch the sunrise on my way to work. And this morning I got out of bed, even though I played hooky from work, to go have a nice breakfast with my husband.

cV5SKKURaa	I'm 19 weeks and my tummy feels tight after a really good orgasm too!  Like right down where the pubic bone is to my belly button.  I think the sex feels better because of increased blood flow to the vagina.  I notice my orgasms are way more intense.

It can induce labor, but probably not at 16 weeks.  If you start having contractions talk to your doctor.  As long as your tummy is tight all the time and not getting tight and then loosing up you probably just didn't notice before how tight a pregnant tummy was.  :-)  I know some of my symptoms I don't notice until they are brought to my attention.|`|8824fc230695852baa6df8d684a06dc7aa	the only thing that could be bad don't have sex on the back  or lay on Ur back it cuts off circulation to the baby|`|AA11672684	Unless you are having a high risk pregnancy it is fine to have sex up to the day you have the baby.|`|AA12323598	no because you carrry the bay in you urtus and that protect the baby while it grown in you stomach but it delend on how far off you are in the preancey ! well if your still worry ask your doctor and that i tell you it is safe to have sex during for preneact but only the first three month i think !|`|DAOnqXTiaa	it can be bc your getting farthur along..the bigger you get i found that you are still feeling it the next day in your tummy..bc when you have an orgasm your tummy contracts and with a baby in there it makes your tummy kinda sore like you have been doing crunches for hours..lol..but your not hurting the baby in anyway.|`|VZZs5N7Raa	sex can not hurt the baby unless you have a high risk pregnancy and the doctor told you not to.

The orgasm is probably different because your hormones are all over the place. The tummy tightness is most likely not related.
1819c9477409a8f5ac1f383fdbd03f2faa	Your statement is kind of black and white. <br>  <br>  Speaking from my own experience of working with drug offenders, many children who turn into adults hide there addictions well and even if the parents realize they have a problem, addiction has such a strong hold that children, teens, young adults are oblivious to there pleas for them to stop. Drug addiction will make you lie, cheat, steal, hurt your family and most can do nothing to stop it. Addiction is a terrible thing but parents are not always to blame for it. Addiction can be something you are born with. Most parents do not know what there kids do. I know plenty of people who did hard drugs and just knew how to keep it from there family. That is how a addict works. It is not always attention that is the problem. Some of these children, young adults also have a dual problem with mental illness. Some self medicate to keep there depression or other mental illness in check. Some just get into it as recreation and then it gets out of hand. Some fall victim to pressures from friends. Its not that easy to just say parents are oblivious|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i agree with you|`|3834a20f7f3cce655a7beeba92c29db0aa	Ye si think it can be, good luck|`|43cc664accc0876d31908b7a2daf4e40aa	You have kids to love and cherish and nourish, not ignore.<br>  <br>  Anyone who ignores their kids shouldn't be parents, kids can get into all kinds of trouble if they don't feel loved or cared for.|`|LUdychxoaa	I think sometimes parents can be oblivious, beginning when their kids are babies.Adults have a tendency to treat babies and toddlers like they're incapable of learning anything unless we purposefully teach them.We bring harmful things into our homes in all kinds of ways, even living wrong behavior in front of them, expecting them to be oblivious. No one's perfect, but shouldn't we take responsibility for our little sponges?Surely if we try we could each remember some things that affected us that the big people never seemed to notice?The sooner we all face the Truth, the sooner the healing can begin.Yeah, it might hurt, but isn't it worth it?Don't we want to be ok?Don't we at least want our kids to be well?Are we not willing to do whatever it takes for those we love?|`|i0oF9CjJaa	Kids go down the wrong road because of a number of reasons. Sometimes parents stay on their kids and they still do bad things. Every situation is special.
5QWSicf8aa	First of all, I hope you are pregnant! <br>  <br>  They should be testing your husband as well. I have a friend who is going through this right now.

1VOsRV8Maa	Yes... To a point. My mother is a great mother and she spanked us kids. (I'm one of nine children... All from the same two parents, and they are STILL married 33 years later!) I have one child, and another on the way. If my children need spankings, I will give them spankings. The Bible says if you spare the rod, you will spoil the child. I don't believe you need to spank children for no good reason, but if the offense is a "spankable offense," then you should spank. My mother used to do something with us. She would make us go pick out our own spanking spoon from her utensil drawer and go wait for her in the bathroom (She wouldn't do it in front of everyone, cause she wasn't doing it to embarrass us.) Sometimes she'd come in and just talk with us and wouldn't spank us, but other times, we'd get the spanking we deserved. I asked her about 6 years ago why she would make us wait, and she told me she would go into her room, get on her knees, and pray. She would pray for God to take away her anger at us so she wasn't spanking out of anger, but out of love and discipline! The times when she'd come in and we wouldn't get spanked were the times she felt that the punishment didn't fit the crime, and we just needed a "lecture." It worked! And that's the same way I'll discipline my children!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Do I want the government or anyone else telling me how I can discipline my child or what I can teach them? NO.  It isn't their place to raise the children of parents or to be interferring with how parents raise their children or what faith they raise them in or even what school they send them to etc..  <br>  <br>  That said, I have no problem with spanking- meaning a few swats on a bottom or a swat on the hand when a child is about to do something dangerous or is being deliberately defiant with their behavior and thus harming themselves or someone else.  Do I think spanking is an end all cure all for every single thing? No. I don't. I think it has it's place and appropriateness for situations (stealing, deliberately doing something harmful to self or others, lying for example) .  I think that it has to be a last resort and that other consequences should be tried for things first- time out (for young children obviously), taking away a toy or privilege, extra work around the house (obviously for older children who could), etc.. <br>  <br>  Do I think people should be allowed to beat and abuse their children with coat hangers, power cords and belts or other things just to beat them for any little thing or any reason they feel like? No.  I think that is dispicable and those people shouldn't be allowed to have children when they are neglecting their needs and physically causing injury and harm to a child "just because".    I will never be OK with abuse in any form to anyone- child or adult.  It's wrong. <br>  <br>   People confuse spanking with abuse and it really doesn't even come close to being that.  Sure,a kid that gets spanked will have a smarting bottom for a little while, but in reality they aren't going to be bruised, blistered or harmed physically from it.  You can't say that about child abuse.|`|NuvKPl3naa	there is a big line between discipline and physical abuse. there is nothing wrong with a smack on the hand or butt. Belts or objects on the face etc.. is not teaching your child anything. i was beat as a child and it did not teach me discipline only anger and sadness. yes i swat my kids but not physically harm them.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	if you mean spanking then Yes they should provided that it is not abusive ..if you leave marks that last more than 24 hours bruises welts blisters ..then that is abuse <br>  if you spank for the wrong reasons that is also abuse ..<br>  <br>  I say yes because spanking can be an effective punishment , in some cases a deter ant , and it does remind the child who is in charge ..which seems to be lacking these days ..<br>  <br>  That being said i don't believe spanking shoal be done liberally but cautiously after careful consideration ..|`|yznZqcznaa	I think that a parent should be allowed to spank their child however I think that it should be done in a loving way.  Never out of frustration or anger and the child would need to know exactly what they did wrong to deserve the spanking. I also think warnings are important so the child knows boundaries before the spanking comes.  IE do not go outside without mommy or you will get a spanking.  There are many children that do not need spankings as a form of discipline and I think its the parents responsibility to know the child and know if there are other things that would work.  I think spankings should be a last resort not a first.  My parents did spank however not me because I did not need them.  I responded to their disapproval and made corrections very fast if I knew they were upset.|`|PwhrTNZraa	Sometimes my daughter gets a spanking.  She has to do something pretty bad and if she is completely disregarding anything I'm saying she gets a smack.  Most of the time all I have to do is get down to eye level with her while holding her wrist and she listens, but for the times when she is out of control she knows.  I've only had to smack her about 3 times (she's 3 1/2), so when I do have to do it, she knows she's done something wrong.  Parents should not be afraid to discipline their children, that's part of what's wrong with society these days I'm sure of it.  <br>  <br>  I also do not believe an object should be used when physically disciplining, and as long as it's done with "taste" (for lack of a better word lol), and not being "abusive" it's ok.  Time out does NOT work with all children, no matter how much we would like it to.  We do not live in a perfect world so each parent needs to discover what discipline technique works for them.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	The only time some one should hit any one is in self defense, hitting just shows that you can't control your own anger and are as poorly behaved as the child. <br>  <br>  If you don't want them touching the toaster, put it out of reach, the only part of the oven that is hot is the hot plate, so I don't know why some one would put their child on the sideboard next to a burning hot plate.<br>  <br>  It's illegal for people to hit you and laws don't just apply to situations that you want them to, you keep going on about how rules are important so follow them yourselves.|`|AA12221392	yes. you have got a lot of good reason to justify why spanking is okay. And I agree with most of the posters comments completely. <br>  <br>   So I wont go on to repeat all the same info they already have, when they did a awesome job stating it already...|`|qLkknQx1aa	there is a limit, but yes. - if your kid wants to stick his hand in and/or near a hot oven and your telling him "no" ten times doesn't work.  smack the hand i say........ - okay, bring on the thumbs down people....|`|prqrQcd1aa	Honestly it depends on the child and if it works with the child or not...and what the physical discipline is for...i mean obviously you wouldn't spank a child for hitting someone..that just shows them it's okay to hit..|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	NO.They should not. Physically disciplining a child does not teach the child anything about Respect. Respect is earned, not demanded.|`|LknYI7FFaa	a good old a$s whipping always seem to work for me. and i got many of them|`|rHDWxzDraa	well that's a tricky one... i say yes, depending on a few factors, firstly you must keep in mind there is a difference in discipline and child abuse. smacking a child on the hand or bottom i feel is acceptable anything else a complete no no. you also have to keep in mind if the age is appropriate to smacks. older kids just ain't going to feel it, and may even rebel against the discipline. its better to smack the kids while they are younger, they will learn alot easier at a younger age what types of behaviour is apporiate, also will have alot more respect for you when they are older. <br>  to just give you an example of why i feel im right, think about todays youths and how disrespectful they are compared to the our older generation. there is a big difference! todays youths are not scared of anything, they have so many rights that keep them protected its ridiculous!  also one more point it says in the bible if you love you child not to spare the rod.|`|ea25d9076fec2a98ef5108000f8e3290aa	Yes, but in moderation and to only be used when a child does something *pretty bad* like breaking something because they were acting crazy, or hurting an animal, having a fit, or running out in the street etc etc.. basically when a child gets out-of-line or might hurt themselves. Some people go WAY too far with their punishments on their kids tho :( <br>  <br>  I was yelled at and occasionally when I would get too out of line I would get either spanked or smacked but it never left permanent marks or anything. It was also never an every-day occurance either<br>  <br>  Even in nature, for example, a mother cat with her kittens. The mother cat occasionally bites or scratches the babies if they do something she doesnt want them to do. This is the same as spanking a child to a human, in my opinion. You just have to know when enough is enough. A whap or two on the bottom now and then isnt going to hurt the child, just get their full attention|`|tluojTpSaa	i think so.  It was widely accepted years and years ago, and those children grew into decent adults.  Nowadays you have spoiled brats who think they are so fabulous, and no one can tell them anything, because they are always right.<br>  i think physical discipline has to start right away...you cant wait until the child is 9 and then decide you have had enough.  it has to be consistent.  You make lines that the kids cannot cross, like talking back at school.  If that line is crossed, they get a hard behind smack.<br>  I dont think it is necessary in all cases.  A lot of kids are good kids and just mess up.  But kids who behave badly all of the time need something, or they will end up in jail.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	yes.<br>  <br>  i think spanking a child for being naughty or defiant is fine. However, my definition of a spanking is 2-7 (or so) slaps across a child's bottom only using your open hand. a pants down spanking should only be used for extremely naughty behavior (playing with matches, etc.). children should not be spanked before 3-4 yrs old, and probably should stop after a child is 13, at the latest.|`|15qceXaOaa	definetly give ur kid a spanking when they need it. when u ground them or something it doesnt really work. u show them its wrong but they just get mad @ u until u give it back to them. but if they get mad @ u when u give them a spanking then just spank them again. if u take away their cell phone they only have 1 phone so thats a 1 time punishment. but u can spank them all they need.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Depends on what exactly we're talking about.  A spanking every now and then?  Yes.  A smack across the face or a daily belt lashing?  No.<br>  <br>  I was spanked as a child, and I turned out just fine.  I think all that crap about how spanking a kid is emotionally disturbing to them is nothing more that a load of bs meant to keep therapists and pharmaceutical companies in business, because you better believe they will medicate everyone they can, and cite some random disorder to make the parents think there's really something wrong with them.  When in reality, the kid is just pissed off because they have parents that actually care what they are doing, and care enough about their child to have some backbone and not allow them to get away with anything.<br>  <br>  However, I also believe that a person who punches their kid or something like that is completely in the wrong.  That is not discipline, that is abuse. <br>  <br>  Did your parents ever tell you "this will hurt me a lot more than it will hurt you"?  That statement is true.  Any parent who is spanking their kid as a punishment doesn't do it because they like it, or because they want to hurt their kid.  It is hurtful to know that you have to discipline your child, and that somehow as a parent you must have done something wrong or the kid would have known better to begin with.<br>  <br>  I'm sure this will get me a lot of thumbs downs, but I don't care.  If more kids had some actual discipline, and not just a little "no, johnny, don't do that", then our jails wouldn't be as full, we wouldn't have as many teens who are pregnant or strung out on drugs, and we wouldn't have to be paying for all the stuff that we as taxpayers foot the bill for.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	physially discipline Im assuming you mean spanking. As long as the child is not being beat seriously hurt, parents should be "allowed"to do what they wish with their kids...when you start taking away rights like this many others follow...like vaccinations and even choosing which god you want to worship.....I just think we need to be super careful about not pushing "laws" all over the place.....otherwise we will find ourselves in a communist country.
hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Oro Rubi,<br>  <br>  It would be helpful to know what issues and perspectives you wish to find literature on. Also, where you are adopting from and where you are living would help improve the chances of finding something specific to your needs. Most of the books written about adoption in English are widely available in Spanish as well. I would think that the much of the general information about adoption and adoption issues would be the same or at least similar no matter the ethnicities and cultures involved so it might still be beneficial to simply judge the books on their individual merit rather and the usefulness and possible application of its contents to one's own situation than on where or by whom they were written.  <br>  <br>  I think you might have better luck running a search through a bookseller. One of the problems is that when you run a search on "Latin American Adoption" you get all kinds of titles specializing in white people raising Latin American children. Correct me if I am wrong, but this would not be the case in your situation. As I said before though, some of the information might still be useful to you. <br>  <br>  I didn't know whether you wanted to read in English or Spanish either so here is a mix of titles I found on a quick search. (My Spanish is a bit rusty but I'm pretty sure all of the Spanish books are actually about adoption, please forgive me if I am wrong! LOL!)<br>  <br>  The link is where I found most of the ones I listed and carries books in many languages so you might have better luck there. <br>  <br>  One other option is to join a support group that caters to your situation. Most of the time, these groups have a recommended or suggested book list for their members.<br>  <br>  ?Buena suerte! - Good Luck! You are wise to educate yourself and I hope you find something that suits your situation! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is what I could find:<br>  <br>  *"My Boys, The Immigrants", by Skila Brown<br>  *"Raising Nuestros Ni?os: Bringing Up Latino Children in a Bicultural World", by Gloria G. Rodriguez<br>  *"In Their Own Voices", by Rita J. Simon and Rhonda M. Roorda <br>  *"Best of Adopted Child: Ethnic and Cultural Diversity",by<br>   Lois Melina<br>  *" La Adopcion: Nacional E Internacional", by Zulema D. Wilde<br>  *"Adopcion: Integracion Familiar", by Marta N. Stilerman, Silvia E. Sepliarsky<br>  *"La Adopcion Y Los Nuevos Tribunales De Familia" by Jordan Campillay Fernandez<br>  *"Acogimiento Y Adopcion", by Esther Gonzalez Pillado, Pablo Grande Seara<br>  *"Derechos Sucesorios De Los Hijos Adoptivos En El Codigo Civil: Problemas De Derecho Transitorio", by Alfredo Sanchez-Rubio Garcia<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestwebbuys.com/books/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestwebbuys.com/books/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  PS Seems like there is plenty of room for you to write one.

Make sure the calculator you used goes by your missed period.<br>  If you know your conception date, you will see that  it doesn’t match up with how many weeks along you are. That is because gestational age is measured not by conception date, but by the date of your last period. So if you have a regular cycle and are 6 weeks along, your baby is only 4 weeks old.|`|A5fcBRyjaa	Count forward from the first day of your last period. For example, if your last period was on June 4 (that was on a Wednesday) you would count one week on every Wednesday past that so you would be 5 weeks today (just an example).

If so, then that is the most accurate way. If not, use one of the many charts online to determine your due date based on the FIRST day of your last period. I went for my first scan at what I thought was 8 weeks 3 days (by those charts) and I was actually only 7 weeks 3 days...GRRRRR!!!! I'm 10 weeks 4 days now and I wish I could gain that week back!!!

I was in the hospital all the time because she could not breath right (heavy breath's). <br>  Finally they discovered that she had asthma. And we had to go out and buy her a machine that would allow her to take the puffers.<br>  Ask about her having asthma, lots of babies are born with it now a days. <br>  My baby is 3 now and only needs the puffers when she gets a cold.

Also another thing you may want to look into is maybe she has allergies... do you have animals in the house ? That could be it. You may need to elevate her too when she sleeps. I would also like for you to talk to your dr about her maybe having GERD (Acid Reflux) because GERD babies sounds like that too. And I remember answering a colic question for you last night. My youngest had acid reflux and colic when she was a baby so I know how it is. Hope my suggestions and links help.|`|38657158bab92ad0c91e93bc79ef07f8aa	Wait a little longer.  Have patience.

HOWEVER, your child is too young to get this problem.  Is your child being looked after a nanny who has upper respiratory viral infection?  If yes, then ask her to get well first and then start taking care of your child.  You may expand this advise to cover any others who might be taking care or playing with your child.  In olden days, it was a manifestation of congenital syphylis.  It wont be a bad idea to get a VDRL and FTA or RPR test for your child.

Then, I gradually changed his feeding times, so this final bottle of the night was late and he went off to sleep.

This worked until I broke him from the bottle at 1 year.|`|3c5f047835fb356236f98274178cb67eaa	I cannot tell you enough about the book "babywise" by the Ezzos! I have 3 children and all of them slept through the night by 7 weeks, I am talking a good 6-8 hours by a couple of months they were sleeping 10 - 12 hours! HUGE blessing! My sister, and several friends have also used their scheduling techniques and they really work. You do not have to make them cry to sleep b/c they will naturally fall into the right pattern. The only people I know who it didn't work for  were those who changed the schedule completely. <br>  <br>  So important...do not use it as a LAW but as a tool to help guide your child. The clock should never dictate it simply helps you have an idea! it not only helped them sleep but showed me what their differnt cries were for, i could tell whether they were hungry, tired or sick! It is wonderful!|`|6b0183be8b59d389afaeae26f5356580aa	Is he eating atleast the required about of food and drinking the required amount of formula daily?

I had a checklist.<br>  <br>  1. I switched my baby's formula to carnation goodstart Supreme ~ easy to digest formula. that made aworld of difference for us. make sure your baby is getting enough ounces w/ each feeding. maybe  he needs more depending on his age.  <br>  <br>  2. My baby likes the temperature in her room to be on the cool side ~66.  and she does not like to sleep in heavy PJ's.  she liked to be swaddled when she was younger and then we went to a light blanket tucked in the sides.  <br>  <br>  3. kept her mattress on a slight  incline to help her reflux. <br>  <br>  4. Since my baby was born , we used an air filter for white noise on medium. she still loves it and is now 13 months.  (and when she was younger, sometimes I would let the vacuum run in the next room for about 5 minutes or until she fell asleep. it worked like a charm EVERY time. <br>  <br>  5. I also gave her the soothie pacifier. <br>  <br>  6. I made sure her sleeping area was dark and comfortable and quiet(turned down the phones and no tv). especially in the first couple months.<br>  <br>  7. Before I gave her bottle, made sure her diaper was changed and she was dressed comfortably. I didn't want to jostle her after bottle. <br>  <br>  8.. When my daughter was younger  I would rock her in my lap and then lay her down after she was asleep. then I started rocking ehr and laying her down awake(but sleepy)  and now i just lay her down awake.  It took a couple months for the transition.<br>  <br>  9.  I kept a notebook and wrote down times for feedings, diaper changes, and sleeping everyday.

TFUHxzPZaa	I have found a handy dandy color picker! I didn't know such a thing existed. It is way cool dude. Try it for your answer. My guess is blue eyes and medium brown hair. Good luck and congrats!!!|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Hair...will be red,blonde,black,brown.  Eyes will be Green, blue, brown,grey, hazel.  Genetics go farther back than just mommy and daddy.  A child can have ANY color hair and eyes as long as there is a gene in the "mix" for that color.  My ex husband has dark brown hair, my natural color is mousy brown, my ex has dark brown eyes, I have green hazel eyes...my daughter has medium red hair and very dark green almost black eyes.  .  She got them from her great grandfather on her paternal grandmother's side.|`|12hB11Zkaa	If you both have blue eyes, your child will definately have blue eyes but that's the only circumstance of guaranteed eye color. Seeing as how you have green and she has blue, it could go either way for your child. Same with hair colour, it could have black, brown or blonde. When I was a child, I had white blonde hair and it changed to dark brown when I was around 10 years old. There's no exact science here!|`|3IwdJvOtaa	That is one question you will have to wait and see. You are just excited and gradulation.

Te aconsejo que compres una prueba de embarazo en la farmacia que dan positiva entre la semana 4 y 8 del embarazo y eso mas o menos seria tu tiempo de gestación si asi fuera . Suerte|`|97d9462b3c636f9752cb36c76c345b9baa	Jess,<br>  <br>  Este es un tema delicado, lo mas probable es que no estes embarazada puesto que las pastillas anticonceptivas lo que hacen es que inhiben la ovulacion. Pero si en esos dias que no te la tomastes ovulastes puede que  tengas una posibildad muy remota que si estas embarazada. No te asustes no es el fin del mundo. Sinembargo el que te sientas cansada y sensible puede ser simplemente que te este al caer la menstruacion y tambien tienes que tomar en cuenta que como te sientas fisicamente no es solo un factor hormonal sino que puede ser tambien algun estress. Haztes las siguientes preguntas:<br>  <br>  Si tienes un ciclo menstrual regular, estas atrasada?<br>  Tienes los senos sensibles a cualquier roze?<br>  El dolor de ovario es seguido o a veces?<br>  Hay algun factor de tu medio ambiente que haya cambiado?(dejaste el trabajo, examenes, una discucion, estress)<br>  <br>  Tienes que tener cuidado puesto que a veces uno mismo se hace la psicosis y el estress de poder estar embarazada te crea un embarazo psicologico.<br>  <br>  El dolor de ovario puede ser debido a las pastillas que estas tomando. Recuerda que con cualquier pastilla que desajuste el nivel hormonal del cuerpo van a ver cambios en tu fisiologia. Date tiempo y estate al tanto de los cambios asi sabes cules son normales y cuales no. <br>  Si tu ciclo de menstruacion es normal (de 28 a 31 dias) recuerda que un mes puede ser que te caiga en 28 dias y el otro 31.<br>  Te recomiendo que tu mejor opcion es que te relajes, y si no te ha caido la menstruacion en 4 a  7  dias despues de que te tiene que caer toma y hazte una prueba que venden sin prescripcion. Asi te quitaras la preocupacion de encima. De todas manera si deseas llama o ve a un medico para que te explique mejor.<br>  <br>  Espero te haya ayudado|`|ZKb6B5isaa	Hazte la prueba y sal de dudas.<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|addd60a701486de1b4244d012fa4fc2daa	Por lo k as dixo eso son síntomas de la regla y no del embarazo... pero weno si tienes alguna duda azte un test d embarazo o ve al medico, pero no nos preguntes a nosotros que no sabemos nada... ademas estas preguntas de embarazo ya cansan muxoooo...... es obvio k si as tenido relaciones sin precaucion puedes estar embarazada, pero no somos videntes, entiendelo y deja de acer esas preguntitas mujer... k existen otras maneras para salir de dudas!!|`|b1c56f0fca13d656b0d094543fb999bdaa	Disculpanos, pero en esta comunidad no te lo podemos responder, porque no somos quién para sabverlo...<br>  <br>  Sólo te puedo dar un consejo, hacé la prueba y no tengas mas dudas<br>  <br>  Disculpanos por no poder darte una respuesta segura...

f1473735c5021d25ffc87c0e9e64eda0aa	After you do have sex, stick a pillow under your bottom to help raise up your pelvis and send the sperm swimming in the right direction. Lay like that for about 15 minutes. If you are overweight at all try to loose a bit of weight. Are you on pre-natal vitamins already? If you are TTC, you should be :)<br>  <br>  If you don't conceive after about 6 months of trying, make an appointment with your ob/gyn|`|c7e598682dd35bc97d81a06696aa5d14aa	I am a nurse,if you really want to get pregnant try first to have a fertility check up to check for any hormonal imbalance, dont use any contraceptive and if you want to get pregnant right away do it in your fertile days.If you want there is an in-vitro fertilization.|`|905401cc19618c03b78dfac56c5814bcaa	a sperm donner maybe|`|83864c555367af25674aaae5981613a1aa	Keep trying. My fertility doctor said to have intercourse every two day from day 7 through day 20.  Take pre-natal vitamins as recommended prior to getting pregnant.  Speak to you obgyn.  For our second child, my wife took a shot which helped trigger ovulation.  There are many different treatments a fertility doctor can offer.  Many are covered and affordable and not as drastic as artifical insemenation or invtiro.  Good luck|`|AA10925330	I had sex every other day four days before my ovulation and then on ovulation and until four days after. So it's really on days 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18. I had read that we really get pregnant before ovulation. And I didn't even have sex on day 14, ovulating day, and got pregnant. SO I think I got preggie day 12. And that worked for me. I also did the put the pillow under my hips right after, to help those guys swim.
54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	You can do one now... if it comes back negative and your period still doesn't show up, try taking another one next week.<br>  <br>  Or wait until Friday (if you can stand the wait) and do the test then. First morning urine works the best for HPTs, but I did mine at 11 pm (before I missed my period) and it still came back positive.. I couldn't stand the wait ;).<br>  <br>  Is there any sign that your period's on its way? Sometimes they trick us and show up a bit later.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	take one now.  if it comes out neg. but u still feel like ur pregnant then wait another week or 2 and take another or just go to doc and get blood test|`|0MbiROgJaa	If you already missed your period then it is time to take a test and if it comes out negative wait a few days and if you don't start test again in a few days.|`|8824fc230695852baa6df8d684a06dc7aa	wait a week if you still dont start do it . But when you goto pee on it do it first thing in the morning.....|`|NkiGYmiCaa	take a test the day of your missed period.|`|c97262lkaa	No if you get a good test, you can actually take it a couple days before you are expecting your period.  I would go get one now and take it, and if it comes back negative, try it again in a couple days if you still havn't had a period.  Good Luck!
2916e2e43d8eeed4a93ea5c00fddda70aa	YES, you're probably at the most fertile part of your cycle, and if you have not taken the pill for a week, it's not protecting you at all!|`|87e8184f643ec4cb00ae7615748f1da2aa	Heads up... you're most fertile midway through your cycle. You didn't mention whether you had intercourse or not during this time.<br>  The good news is, if you've been on the pill for a while, you likely did not release an egg. Of course, that's BAD news if you are trying to get knocked up, eh?<br>  Take a pregnancy test before starting your pills again so that you don't give birth to a retard.|`|15af0af8142a9f20ff84c298727b8d74aa	Yes there definitely is a chance you could get pregnant if you have had sex during this menstrual cycle.  If you are planning on having sex over the next two weeks, use extra protection.<br>  <br>  P.S. you can take the morning after pill up to 72 hours after intercourse so that's another idea...

QTqnIncjaa	Hola!!! <br>  Leelo espero que lo tomes en cuenta!!!!Creo que parte importante de todas las responsabilidades que implica el ser padre debería de ser el hecho de escoger el nombre para el futuro ni?o.

Ulo4mDbOaa	no, es falso eso de las hemorragias (si estoy en un error corrijanme pero creo que es falso), ya que tengo entendido que a los bebes alimentados con pecho se les debe dar hierro desde los 4 meses (los alimentados con formula deben tomar una suplementada), y los bebes PREMATUROS DESDE LOS 2 MESES!!, y si le recetan hierro a un bebe prematuro (que son los mas delicados), no creo que el hierro tenga ese tipo de efecto secundario.<br>  <br>  personalmente mi bebe esta con lactancia materna exclusiva , y no le di hierro, porque mi bebe sufre de reflujo gastroesofagico, y el hierro de ninguna marca lo tolera, y opte por no darselo ya que antiguamente nadie tomaba suplemento y todos crecimos sanos.<br>  <br>  pero si tu bebe no lo devuelve, no tiene contraindicaciones, eso si, a mi bebe le recetaron una gota por  kg. si crees que 10 gotas es mucho, estas en todo tu derecho de darle menos, y no pasa nada.<br>  <br>  saludos y suerte!<br>  <br>  aproposito, las vitaminas que le daras no tienen ninguna contraindicacion, y se las puedes dar hasta el a?o, a mi bebe desde el mes me dijieron 5 gotas hasta el a?o.|`|5Dgz2lXvaa	haslo como lo receto el medico|`|C7OXkUzBaa	Suerte..|`|aluHMbukaa	si esta muy bien la receta de su medico el hierro polimaltosato es un antianemico muy recetado en lactantes y ni?os y  en la cantidad que se receto no esta mal y no se conocen problemas en ni?os a los que se les administró hierro asi que recuerda es muy importante que le des el hierro este es un elemento esencial para la síntesis fisiológica de la hemoglobina y es necesario para una adecuada eritropoyesis y el consecuente transporte de oxígeno. Actúa como cofactor de diversas enzimas que incluyen el sistema citocromo y también interviene en el metabolismo de las catecolaminas y en la actividad de los neutrófilos.|`|40an5OOqaa	Si su medico le receta algo a su bebé es por que lo necesita<br>  No te preocupes si solo son 10 gotas por dia durante un tiempo, si no es un tiempo muy prolongado no le hará nada a menos que ella tenga otro problema.<br>  Asegurate de seguir las indicaciones del medico y que la medicina sea para bebes.<br>  Suerte!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cV4lxXdxaa	Es normal que le recenten hierro y vitaminas a los bebes, mi hijo que ya tiene un a?o y medio lo ha tomado y no le paso nada.

Yo te digo que si fue el doctor quien te las indicó se las des, para eso se pasó a?os y a?os el estudiando, para saber que es lo mejor para los bebés. éxitos.-|`|91ba63f978eae72b3d1486aeb8118bdfaa	Amiga: El pediatra también le recetó hierro a mi hijo y me contó que en general se lo indican a todos los bebés hasta los seis meses como mínimo. Mi fijo tenía que tomar gotas llamadas ferrigot, pero no hubo nunca ningún problema. Creo que debes confiar en tu médico y en sus conocimientos. Mi hijo tenía que tomar exactamente lo mismo que tu bebé y nunca tuvo problemas gástricos ni de ningún tipo.<br>  Saludos y buenos deseos.

Ask your doctor whether or not it is safe.|`|JcGEEDTMaa	I know sex is awesome and stuff but rather than killing another baby this time, how's about you take more responsibility this time in preventing pregnancy.  I would check with your doctor whether or not it is safe.|`|FwAWlxxZaa	BABY KILLER!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm so against abortion.|`|j64urmgvaa	i think 6 weeks is ok
4mzbkw07aa	She may not necessarily be preggers.  Sometimes periods can be shorter when the uterine lining is depleted.  When your gf has a normal period, the uterus is shedding its lining because it doesn't need it.  (There's no pregnancy.)  Sometimes, the uterine wall doesn't have a thick lining and it sheds what it has, meaning a little period.  So, without a test, every thing's just a guess- you should have her take a test, and then another one next month to be sure!|`|ejbSFv0caa	If she is still quite young it is normal to have many fluctuations in her menstrual cycle.

I would have her take a pregnancy test...Good luck|`|2ZWYtyROaa	It depends on what her periods are usually like. Sometimes they can be very irregular. I've had irregular ones my whole life. Last time I got them, it was only two weeks after I'd finished my last one. The amount varies as well. <br>  <br>  If you just had sex, and she was a virgin, the 1 day bleeding could have been from that. OR even if she wasn't a virgin and you were a bit rough.|`|ycVDakGOaa	yes. sometimes if a girl is pregnant she will have light spotting and short or irregular period. or she might just have a weird period...who knows. but it is possible. if you are worried you should have her take a test|`|lvKp3SGwaa	Yes, she could be pregnant.

5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	Formula poop is often green from the iron.  Here's more on green poop if you think something else might be going on:<br>  Green Poop<br>  <br>  Every now and then the notorious green poop may show up in your baby’s diaper. You may take a look at it and ask yourself “how’d that get there?” There are many different causes for green poop. More than likely, if your baby has green poop, it’s nothing to worry about, but here are a few possibilities.<br>  <br>      * Iron-fortified formula - Some formula-fed babies will develop a case of green poop from the iron in the formula they are taking. As long as your baby is happy and not having any problems with constipation, there is nothing to worry about.<br>      * Jaundice - A baby that has jaundice may have dark or greenish colored stools. This normally goes away once baby is off of the bilirubin lights.<br>      * Dairy Sensitivity - Some breastfed babies are very sensitive to certain foods in their mom’s diet. If your baby is having problems with green mucousy stools, blood in his stools, spitting up a lot, or a skin rash, he may be sensitive to something in your diet. Dairy products are one of the most common causes of food allergies in babies. If you think this might be the problem, try eliminating milk and dairy products from your diet. It may take a couple weeks to see results from a dairy elimination diet. You should see improvement in a week or two. If you’re not sure, you can always try it out for a few weeks and then try having a cup of milk to see what happens. If the symptoms come back, then milk is probably the culprit and you will want to avoid it.<br>      * Foremilk/Hindmilk imbalance - If your baby is breastfeeding and has green frothy-looking poops, this may be a result of a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance. To put this simply, when a mom breastfeeds the first milk that comes out (foremilk) is thinner and lower in fat. After you have nursed for a bit, you will start to produce richer, fattier milk called hindmilk. Babies that receive too much of the thin foremilk and not enough of the richer hindmilk sometimes have problems with green stools and tummy aches. If you have been switching breasts a lot instead of letting baby get a good feed on one breast, you may have problems with this.<br>      * Other reasons - Sometimes babies just have greenish colored poop. The range of color in baby’s poops can vary. Any range of yellow, mustard to yellow/green is pretty normal for a baby. If baby is gaining well and happy then there is nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  |`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Green poop is COMPLETELY normal...as long is there is no blood and it's not black it's fine...it's just from the iron in the formula...my son's has awlways been green!!!|`|96ojhoXvaa	I would reevaluate the formula, green poop does not always mean something is wrong, but if it continues, take her to the dr, b/c green pop could mean infection.  also, if she is really gassy burrp her every 1/2 oz to 1 oz to see if she will burp that often, if she does then continue doing it if not, then go back to every 2 oz or whatever, my daughter burped every 5-6cc's as an infant it took her like 35 minutes to drink 1oz to 1.5oz!!|`|530c3299f65febef45b92beb948593d4aa	I have read and been told that green stool is a result of a healthy diet.   I would call your pediatrician to be sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck! |`|ZqJJU8wAaa	You need to change formulas|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Maybe that formula isnt right for her. Sometimes parents have to try a couple different kinds of formula to find what is best for their baby. My suggestion is to talk with your baby's pediatrician about what formula to try. If she is really gassy and having green poop on the goodstart, i wouldnt give it to her anymore. I had that gassy problem with my son on the enfamil lipil, so i switched to similac advanced... and never had another problem<br>  <br>  Green Poop<br>  Every now and then the notorious green poop may show up in your baby’s diaper.

If baby is gaining well and happy then there is nothing to worry about. <br>  |`|ZXesj4XJaa	My baby has been on formula since she was 2 months old. She takes Similac Alimentum for her protein allergy. Since we switched her to formula, she has had green stool. I suspect it is totally normal. Now if your baby is breastfed, green stool can be a sign of too much foremilk and not enough hindmilk. This happens with mothers who have overactive letdowns, or when moms switch breasts before baby has emptied one breast. <br>  <br>  Babies are naturally gassy. You can ask your Ped if switching to another formula might help. Or, try a different type of bottle. I use Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins, which are great. She burps each time, but doesn't have too much problem with gas. <br>  <br>  Check out my new mommy blog if you'd like to find out more! www.noobmommy.blogspot.com|`|8V2b2Gbqaa	I feed Nestle Good Start and my baby's stool is the same color.  I never thought of it as a problem though, because I was told that their stool's color and consistency is always changing.  She seems healthy, happy and not out of sorts, so I'm not concerned.  |`|VNH5og0Aaa	It's normal. My baby is on good start natural cultures and he poops green, sometimes with yellow in it. It's from the iron. Good start is one of the best formulas. As long as you see that the baby is not upset continue with it.|`|ijhcAiYTaa	Talk with your Pedi and ask him. Most likely he'll tell you that you need to switch formulas. That's what I had to do with my Son. And the dark green is completely normal with babies that age.  |`|9M2IaH7Maa	i think its normal. but at the age of 3 1/2 weeks i think you should be breastfeeding her.|`|SpG5a8deaa	maybe be the formula is not right for her
tQVBDx5Paa	Well does she feel up to it?  If so I would.....what would you do if YOU were sick.  Many a sick momma have to care for a baby.|`|nZBtm3meaa	I'd wait until she's fever free for 24 hours just to be sure.  With the flu or stuff going around, your fever can come and go.  If she's still not feeling up to par, I'd wait.  Nothing worse than a 2 month old who's sick.|`|CZaKcvADaa	If she doesn't have a fever, I would think it's ok. Having a fever means your contagious and as long as she's not contagious, your baby should be fine.|`|Gbs6Sa0haa	He will be OK as long as she does not start running a fever.  When somebody runs a fever they are contagious |`|SpG5a8deaa	of course not..|`|5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	I'd wait until at least 24 hours after the fever went away, assuming she doesn't have any other symptoms.|`|AA12225439	no.|`|K2SlHrb5aa	It's really up to you. Maybe your babysitter just had a touch of something, and is better now. Or maybe she's just starting to get sick. Personally, I'd wait a few days before I let her watch my daughter, but if you must work or something, you don't really have a choice if you can't find anyone else. |`|I358NcRIaa	 im not trying to tell you how to run your life because every mother knows whats best for their child...all moms are different but if it was me and my babysitter was sick i would tell her to take the day off and to get better missing one day of work or having someone else babysit isn't gonna hurt|`|jYPeis3Saa	if your baby has alrady been around her, then the baby has already been exposed to whatever shes come down with. <br>  to be on the safe side just stay with the baby until the sitter gets better. <br>  and breastfed babies do get sick too. |`|jsdDgIuRaa	personally i would not, it is simply awful when your baby gets sick, i wouldn't risk it.  i would wait another day or 2 until she feels completely normal.
1NLNZbzXaa	Its possible you are pregnant. A lot of times there is light bleeding early on the pregnancy. If you're having cravings and all the signs of pregnancy, I would definitely make an appointment with the doc and have them do a test. Even though HPT are pretty accurate, its still a good idea to have the doc do one. Good luck!|`|0JvDsxULaa	could be, but its most likely just irregular....but to put your mind at ease it wont hurt to take another one...|`|SpG5a8deaa	might just be a yeast infection...but if you think you are having pregnancy symptoms than take a test or see a doctor soon|`|d5dKlgEPaa	your period can vary in thickness and color. brown is normal, as well as a brighter red. i wouldn't worry about it if i were you.
fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	um yea i had a friend who was on her period for the first 5 months pregnant and idk about whens the best way to become pregnant. I dont think you guys  can have any kids sorry|`|ECv4kg5laa	My mom had her period for the first trimester of being pregnant and though it is not common is can happen and as far as the other questions I am unsure. I do not believe that you are more likely to get pregnant if your are on your period but if you really want to get pregnant take an ovulation test and see what happens. Good luck!
CdJtH0xdaa	Five or six, with supervision if it's their first time.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	5?|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	5 or 6|`|XOtOMncwaa	My brother in law owns a skating rink, and most of the kids that are beginners are anywhere from 4-7. I live right across the street from the rink so I go over there alot on the weekends just to peek in and see how things are going, and you would really be surprised at how young some of the kids are out there skating. My brother in laws rink has a beginning skaters section, which I think comes in handy so you don't have to worry about your kid being ran over... and they also have "scooter skates" which are skates that barely roll, it helps the child get a feel for the skates. So I would say it's okay to start at 4? I know my friend has a son who just turned 4, and she took him skating the other day.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Well my son is 4 going on 5 and he got a pair of roller blades for christmas. He has so much fun on them and wants to try roller skating too. His birthday is coming up and we have booked in to take him and some friends roller skating. I think if they want to try it and they are wearing the appropriate safety gear then there's no harm in it. It doesn't matter how old you are...if you've never skated before, you are going to fall!|`|rjVALevtaa	5 years old maybe. An earlier than that I think is just mean.|`|kbIkVS0raa	My daughter was 4 but it took her some time to catch on|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I learned to skate when I was 4 and went to an ice skating rink probably a year later. <br>  <br>  So I guess that is the age I consider around normal to start skating with them. Probably dont' take them to "teen night" at the skating rink, but I don't see why it'd be a problem to have the whole family go.|`|A3MPbSHlaa	3|`|eya1WDS4aa	about 4 or 5.
FqCGlRFMaa	Honestly, makes me think she was conceived in a car.  Sorry!|`|K7H1zrCbaa	its the name of a care and reminds me of the Jetsons.|`|DLDweOcYaa	Jetta for a girl I don't like.  Jett for a boy is good.|`|Bz8tcAOyaa	It's not horrible, but it's not one of my favorites...|`|txFGl5iNaa	I think "car" and "I want to make fun of it"|`|BjEr7FGUaa	I think.. car|`|UcIcuSZGaa	it's ok, unique, which is KEWLFEWLLL! :P|`|e8a42fc3d9262ba1e4876fa849aec7deaa	all i can think of when i hear that name is a car.  Don't like it!|`|4p6KVTOraa	hmm, thats the type of car I drive!
rC6gL7KOaa	I don't think you're hormonal. Personally, I get annoyed when a pregnant woman misspells any word, especially the word pregnant because it's hard for me to accept that they are bringing a child into the world and can't even spell simple words. What are they gonna teach their kid? A lady posted a question the other day and spelled baby "babie". I thinks it's sad.|`|UgcPxd4maa	you're hormonal thats all|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    its normal in pregnancy darling.  we all understand.  god bless|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	Haha yeah, i think you're being a little over the top. Does it really matter? No need to get mad and put stress on your baby. Relax and just ignore it.|`|pdzfq7ojaa	I'm not pregnant and it annoys me to no end when people misspell the word pregnant.  Spell-check pops up on the screen for a reason!|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Yeah kinda. I get annoyed at myself , when I am typing I notice a lot of misspelled words lately. It is like I know how to spell but my fingers won't type right.     Be patient with us, sometimes we overlook the obvious there is a lot of things going on with out bodies, and on our minds.     Thanks    EDIT: see I missed our I spelled out lol I wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't double check it, worried you would call me on it. lol|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Yahoo provides spell check, most people can't spell that well anytime of the year.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	You're not! I am the same way!|`|AA11763588	We are all hormonal.... it's ok.    And to answer your question, yes I get annoyed with: Preggo, Prego, Pregs, Preggy, and Pregnate.|`|BU1f41Wcaa	Ahh who cared we all make mistakes lol :)|`|fPAlfokHaa	We are all hormonal but even before i was pregnant it annoyed me when people misspelled some of the simplest of words.|`|p2J4i6Aiaa	That annoys me as well. I don't know why they can't spell or say the word PREGNANT properly. What is preggers, preggo, or preganent? Only redneck, ghetto, hill billies speak like that!|`|CtDBQwzaaa	ya|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	grammar is my biggest pet peeve    i was in advanced english courses so i understand why you would be upset or annoyed by misspelled words. especially with that little spell checker they have on here.    (by the way: i don't capitalize my i's on y!a)    --> i get annoyed by people who use the words: "preggo" "pregs" or "preggy" and i really dislike the word "hubby"
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	No, it will not cause that.   Nor will the antibiotics.|`|UgcPxd4maa	not usually|`|cj7sSPZEaa	They wouldn't cause you to be that late.  The blood test should be able to tell if you are pregnant or not.  If you aren't, there are several things besides pregnancy that can cause a late period.  Stress, rapid weight gain or loss, certain medications, exercise, eating disorders, and problems with the reproductive organs can all cause your period to be late.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, a urine infection would not cause your period to be late, they're not connected in the slightest way.    You would be 10 weeks and 3 days pregnant. Sometimes women don't get a positive on HPT's until they're much further along, hopefully the blood test would tell you why your period has been so late.

jNErU39iaa	What a lot of people don't know is - to go in to labour both you and the baby have to release a hormone known as Oxytocin. We can get ours to release through nipple stimulation or an orgasm. BUT if you get your Oxytocin to release and the baby hasn't released his/her hormone you wont go into labor. If the baby has released hers, then sex, nipple stimulation, etc will most likely work.    If you have a breast pump, use that for nipple stimulation, otherwise massage the nipples. If this fails - have sex! However none of these are a guarantee, you can't force your baby to release her hormone.    You can eat all of the 'spicey food' and do all the walking that you want, it won't bring on labour, and anyone who did go in to labour after doing those things, it is simply by coincidence.     I went in to labour the day before my due date, (it was the only day I DIDN'T walk in weeks!) and I gave birth the day after my due date =]    Good Luck!|`|cqgWkdPtaa	i went for a walk to the park with my dog one day and i got back and had a lay down on the couch and started having contractions!!! that was at exactly 38 weeks but ..... then i was having contractions for 2 and a half days but that runs in my family!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	SEX SEX SEX lol...thats supposed to be the best even though you probably are not up for it at this point. Try stimulating your nipples, walking, some say eating spicy food works. Goodluck and just think of it this way..i am 29wks and feel like i have years until i reach the finish line and your almost there!! Congrats!! =)|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	I've not had a child but I've heard that sex is a good way.  I'm sure it would be fun too. :)|`|r52rfBkeaa	My only suggestion would be the typical answers you'd find online:  eating spicy food (although this isn't proven), having sex (this is) and walking A LOT (also proven).  My husband and I did all of this the day I was due and I went into labor that night.  If you are going to walk a lot, be sure to drink lots of fluids.  My contractions were closer together because I was dehydrated.  Once they put in the IV, they were further apart. :(|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	There really is nothing you can do until the baby is ready but here's the list I give my mom's to be:    -Walking, walking, walking... If it's cold were you are go to the mall and and try not to smack people staring at your humongous belly and asking you annoying questions like-"Are you having triplets??" Or just walk around your house, I like walking up and down the stairs for some reason.  -Try doing some squatting exercises. If you have a birthing ball-Great! If not try squatting while holding onto the edge of your bed or the couch. Just remember that your balance is really funny right now. You might want to surround yourself with some pillows just in case. Even just sitting on the toilet can help.  -Try and get some raspberry tea, raspberry leaf tea is even better, but harder to find. It'll help tone your uterus.  -Evening Primrose Oil, it contains chemicals similar to prostaglandins that help ripen your cervix. You can either take them orally or insert them vaginally.  -You can also try eating some; spicy food, pineapple, Chinese food, red wine, anise, basil or oregano, they are all foods that might help kick start labor. None of them are proven, but they can't hurt!  -You can also try some trigger acupressure. Take two fingers and press just below your ankle on the inside. Foot rubs that concentrate on the ankles will work too.  -S-E-X... I know, I know, isn't that how you got yourself into this situation?!? But the prostaglandins in semen will help soften your cervix. And the rocking motion, especially of "doggie" style will help bring the baby down.  -Nipple stimulation. It helps release oxcytocin. It also goes along great with the sex...lol    The best thing you can do is relax and know he won't be in there forever. Eventually he has to come out! At least that's what they've always told me. I know it's not easy. So try not to send too many mean thoughts and dirty looks to the women who just tell you "He'll come when he's ready, don't rush him!" Because it is true. And relaxing and enjoying these last few days, hours, minutes... will help him come sooner!    AND...  -As far as taking black/blue cohosh; they should only EVER be taken under the supervision of a midwife or OB. It can bring on labor quickly and give you very intense contractions that start out very close together. I'm not saying they don't work, they do, just sometimes they work TOO well.  -Castor oil I would only suggest taking with the okay of your midwife or OB. I have taken castor oil with all three of my children. But that was only after having my membranes stripped and knowing I was in early labor. It just kind of helps things get moving along, if you know what I mean... It's not dangerous as long you stay well hydrated. I suggest taking two tablespoons with orange juice every three hours, up to 6 tablespoons total. Make sure you mix it up really well. And I like to follow it with a peanut butter cup chaser to help kill the taste. Other suggestions are root beer floats or cooking it into scrambled eggs.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You are using a midwife that wants to induce at 39 weeks?    Get a new midwife now, that one is dangerous.  Seriously I can't even believe that its so disgusting.  Are you sure its a real midwife?  Most first pregnancies go closer to 42 weeks than 40.  induction is one of the top causes of prematurity in the US.    I had one at 41w3d and one at 37 weeks.  Let me tell you the 37 weeker couldn't stay warm, it was a constant battle I basically had to do kangaroo care which is hard when you have a toddler to care for as well.    http://www.naturalchildbirth.org/natural...  Gail J. Dahl, Executive Director of the Canadian Childbirth Association  says the group has worked diligently over the past four years toward  creating informed consent for this elective procedure in Alberta. The  Association highly recommends that the new guidelines also include new  research evidencing longer gestation time for first-time mothers, up to 42  weeks and longer. New research also shows that ultrasound tests used for  gestational dating have an error rating regardless of the trimester, with  the largest error rating to be shown in the last trimester.    http://www.ican-online.org/node/1138/pdf  "It is apparent that the overwhelmingly redundant message of the  literature  is that there is  absolutely no study, no evidence whatsoever, that routine induction at any gestational age improves  perinatal outcome" (Nichols 1985a).    http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/t...  Normal human pregnancy is approximately 280 days, with a variation of about three weeks. There may be reason for concern if labor has not begun weeks after the due date, since placental function begins to slow after some point in gestation. Placental insufficiency can lead to poor fetal growth and, eventually, damage to the baby's organ systems or even stillbirth. This is rare, but it is not necessarily connected to the calendar. The placenta can begin to fail at any point in pregnancy, and part of good prenatal care is monitoring growth and fluid levels so we can act before the baby's reserves are drained. We induce laboreven advise a cesarean without laborif the baby is in trouble, regardless of due dates. It is obvious that a baby is "better off out than in" if the placenta can no longer nourish him/her or if the uterus has become a dangerous place.    Induction Risks    But induction of labor causes so many problems that it should be a rarity, performed only when the benefits can be proven to outweigh the risks. Induction multiplies the risk of cesarean section, forceps-assisted delivery, shoulder dystocia, hemorrhage, fetal distress and meconium aspiration. It is a major contributor to birth-related expenses and complications in the US Yet it is so common that we almost think of it as normal. More than a third of American women were induced in 1999, and another third had labors augmented with Pitocin. (The FDA says that this is the lowest estimate and that the true incidence of induction is "widely under-reported.")    Even with early pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, induction of labor remains one of the largest causes of prematurity. Ultrasonic estimation of gestational age is still an inexact science; the range of error increases as pregnancy advances. Artifact and technician inexperience can multiply the inaccuracy. Many practitioners seem unaware of this error range or, alternatively, are unwilling to second guess a due date "confirmed" by ultrasound, even when the woman's history and clinical assessment indicate a later due date. Hence, the woman may be induced, even though the baby is clearly several weeks early. Some people discount the danger of early induction as long as the baby is within the last month of gestation. But even minor degrees of prematurity can cause harm. Babies born before full maturity can suffer from breathing difficulties or transient tachypnea, requiring separation in the hospital. They may be more prone to meconium aspiration. They are at risk for hypoglycemia and may have trouble maintaining body temperature. They are at increased risk for nursing difficulties and feeding disorders. They suffer from colic and digestive disturbances. These "minor problems" can affect the early bonding experience and make family adjustments more difficult. The incidence of child abuse is higher with "difficult" babies. As midwives we should aim for our families to experience the best emotional as well as physical health possible. A timely birth is a good step in this direction!    Preterm birth is rising in the United States. Some of this rise results from misjudged due dates and the fear of postdates pregnancy. Some reason that the risk of inducing an early baby is lower than the risk of allowing a pregnancy to continue past due, even when the due date is uncertain. This might be true if the perceived risk of postdates matched the actual risk. But it doesn't!    Postdates    Postdates, by itself, is not associated with poor pregnancy outcome. Extreme postdates or postdates in conjunction with poor fetal growth or developmental abnormalities does show an increased risk of stillbirth. But if growth restriction and birth defects are removed, there is no statistical increase in risk until a pregnancy reaches 42 weeks and no significant risk until past 43 weeks. The primary "evidence" of a sharp rise in stillbirth after 40 weeksoften misquoted as "double at 42 weeks and triple at 43 weeks"seems to come from one study based on data collected in 1958.(1)    The first question one should ask is whether neonatal mortality |`|ClbJXmr6aa	ive heard sex helps|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Nothing worked for me.  I had sex often (with both me and my partner orgasming), walked my butt off, and also tried nipple stimulation.  I was induced at 41 weeks and 1 day.    I'm convinced that if the baby and your body aren't ready to go into labor, then no method of induction will work.    Try to not fret about a c-section.  You may be able to handle a vaginally delivery better than you think.  My son was much larger than anyone expected (9lbs 10oz), plus I don't have a very wide pelvis (naturally, that is).  However, with some help from that bloody vacuum, I managed to deliver vaginally.    Edit:  I really would not recommend castor oil.  It's only ever helped one woman I know get into labor; the rest were in pain and on the toilet for hours.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	Dr...told us to have sex...I am serious there is suppose to be something in the sperm that help your cervex ripen to help start labor....I would wait another week before trying to induce your own labor though...we were told to do this after I was 41 weeks...|`|JsaEk8UAaa	The funner options are sex and nipple stimulation. I tried salsa and chips - WOW never again. The salsa that I ate burned both ends and did nothing for starting labor. I tried Evening Primrose Oil a vitamin. You can take it orally or you can rub it on your cervix. I was taking this on and off all day long before my baby was born. I would stop taking the vitamin because I was having contractions. The contractions would stop when I stop taking the vitamin. Horrible cycle that I never want to start again. If you take the vitamin Stick with it...... Ask you midwife if she will do an exam to get things rolling!!! Best wishes!!!|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Dont' try castor oil.  That's just a laxative that gives you such horrible cramps, that it forces you into labor.    I was a week overdue and was SOOO miserable! My daughter was 10 lbs so you can imagine how big I was.  The only thing that helped was sex.  Sperm is supposed to act as some kind of inducing agent... it thins out the uterus wall or something.  My midwife also put her hand up there and said "I'm going to mess around here and see if I can cause something"  And sure enought my plug loosened up. I had lots of sex and was ready to go.  I heard spicy foods are supposed to help too.  I had lots of Indian :)|`|073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	Sex because ejaculate contains prostiglandins which help efface the cervix. So does Evening Primrose oil. Red Raspberry leaf tea is great to tone the uterus for efficient contractions once labour begins. Walking lots & going up and down stairs helps get things going too.  Can't believe a midwife would want to induce early. Mine said she wouldn't even consider induction until I was at least 10 days overdue. It's hard to predict baby's size even with ultrasound technology & measuring the size of the uterus. They are often wayyy off in their predictions. Medical interventions like Induction is far more likely to set you down the path to a c-section than just letting nature take its course.  Happy baby-waiting!|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	walking, nipple stimulation, Acupressure. Sex, eating pineapple not canned but fresh, swinging on a swing can help get baby in the right position for birth, slow dancing& belly dancing can also help get baby on position. I tried all of these but nothing worked but waiting till baby was ready.    http://birthbuddy.wordpress.com/2007/03/...|`|nkzwSX8qaa	Take a ride on a bumby road|`|EfLFTQwnaa	sex has been effective for 4 of my kids, not kidding, or if that doesn't work, well, there are more exotic ways to do it.|`|HbciMmROaa	castor oil worked for me I was a week late with my daughter and on thanksgiving night I drank some mixed with OJ and four hours later I was in labor/pooping..    I heard its dangerous(after I do it) but it worked for me|`|huRnrj0Waa	I had my baby at 37 weeks and she had very bad jaundice so you dont want to have your baby to early. Definatly wait atleast until you are 39 weeks. My husband and I had lots of sex and that is what put me labor. The doctor said that the sperm has a chemical in it that helps induce labor and that same chemical is what is used in Pitocin which is used in hospitals to induce labor.|`|2sXqm4u9aa	I was 2 weeks overdue, miserable, big as a house and doctor told me to go home and walk.  I walked for a few hours, went back to the doctor and I had started to dialate.  Gave birth to a 9 lb 3 oz girl.    The baby will come when its ready.  I would not let the midwife induce.  If there is a problem go the the hospital for monitoring just in case there is a problem.  Sometimes there is no other way than to have a C-section if the baby or you are in distress and baby needs to be delivered immediatley.  I know you are excited but know he or she will be there before you know it.|`|P1LrZdafaa	I tried EVERYTHING !!!!!  SEX, SPICY FOOD, SQUATS, MORE SEX, WALKING, CASTOR OIL..ECT...    I WENT TO THE DR ON A WEDNESDAY AND I WAS 4 CENTIMETERS AND 80%EFFACED JUST LIKE I HAD BEEN FOR 1 MONTH...  ANYWAY MY HUSBAND AND I OWN A RACE SHOP AND ON THURSDAY ( EXACTLY ONE WEEK BEFORE MY DUE DATE) I DECIDED I WAS GETTING OUT OF THE HOUSE AND WENT TO THE SHOP...    I WAS WALKING AROUND CLEANING UP AND MY HUSBAND STARTED THE RACE CAR WHICH WAS ****LOUD***** RIGHT THEN MY WATER BROKE !!!! WE DROVE THE HOUR TO THE HOSPITAL, STOPPED AND GOT STEAK AND SHAKE FOR LUNCH AND ABOUT 9 HOURS LATER I HAD MY LITTLE MAN ....    AND TO THIS DAY MY BABY BOY HAS A NEED FOR SPEED JUST LIKE HIS DADDY !!!!! HE WAS BORN 6/7/07....I ALSO HAVE A LITTLE GIRL BORN 6/1/02 SHE WAS INDUCED..... I DO NOT RECOMMED IT IF YOU CAN HELP IT !!!!      GOOD LUCK|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	Sex is what did it for me... the semen softens your cervix and when you orgasm makes your uterus contract... On a tuesday I was checked (I was 37 weeks and 5 days) and wasn't dilated at all and my cervix was still hard... probably TMI but we had sex wed night and thursday I was checked again and was 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced and then friday night we had sex again and I had her on Saturday... So I'm convinced thats what did it!|`|2MKvrydWaa	well u can use sex,orgams,nipple stimulation,spicy food.nipple stimulation did it for me.i was 37 weeks and i did it for 3 days straight b-4 labor.then i went into labor 38 weeks and 1 day prego.congrats on the beautiful baby on the way.u don't have 2 much longer 2 go.so hang in there.
1ezYfkX7aa	They made me feel sick...i went to my local drugstore and bought these gel capsule ones over the counter and they havnt made me sick at all. =) I believe they were called ExpectaCare.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,some women find they aggravate their morning sickness. Make sure you're taking them with a meal and not on an empty stomach!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Yes they can. If they're making you feel sick try taking them on a full stomach, if that doesn't help then try taking flintstone vitamins. I know that doctors recommend them when normal prenatals make you sick.|`|He1sIjeyaa	they made me feel sick but only during the first month when I felt queasy anyway...its still best that you take them but I had to just do it every other day cause I couldn't take how it made me feel...eventually they were fine to take...im still taking them cause im nursing and my son is almost six months old now.  the doctor can prescribe vitamins that might not be as bad...but the bad feelings should pass|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes they can  i never did get sick but then again i tried to avoid any unnecessary sickness by taking them an hour before bed with a glass of milk|`|AA10015577	Yes some women get sick after they take prenatals.  I found it better (when I had morning sickness) to take it at night because my nausea would wear off by the end of the day.  Some people need to eat something with them, so try both of those options if you wish.  Good luck!|`|8YltlMsjaa	yes, if you do not eat something with them. I have to eat toast or crackers with them      Good luck sweetie*|`|OU9xnW86aa	Yes.    Some brands make some women nauseous. If you don't like the ones you are on ask your doctor to put you on a different kind.|`|DG2fefYnaa	Absolutely!!!.  In fact, the only time I had morning sickness was when I took my vitamins in the morning.  Wait until later in the day, and never take them on an empty stomach.|`|SjdYj5Wdaa	Yes!  Sometimes it's the iron in them that causes the nausea.  Try to take them with a meal or light snack.  Or else take a prenatal without iron and a separate iron supplement.  GNC makes a prenatal without iron (I'm taking it now).|`|YuA7a08Maa	Yes, definitely.  Mine now do not, but I was taking another kind a few years ago before my wedding because somebody told me they'd make my hair and nails grow.  I stopped taking them because I was so nauseous.  They say morning sickness in a lot of women is related to their prenatal vitamin.  The good news is that sometimes switching brands helps.  My sister-in-law had to take hers at night because if she took them in the morning, she'd have a metallic taste in her mouth all day.  Good luck!|`|b4fYwZeraa	I couldn't tolerate them. Took Flinsotnes and if you compare it's all the same stuff as in a prenatal vitamin.
mjz8JF9Gaa	heres what i did     my son was four months   i tried cereal   i mixed it with   breast milk   formula   water   and juice     none of those took   i waited a week and tried again   and again he hated it   so i wated again and    i went for veggies     and he loved them ate evrybit hardly no mess   he just did not like the taste of the cereal   i bought stage 1 baby foods     here is the order i went in     green beans   peas  carrots   squash   sweet potatoes     pears   peaches   applesaue   guava   bananas       if u cant find a single ingredint food in stage one   get the stage two single ingredient there is hardly a diffrence in thickness which is all what baby stages is thickness   dont get stage three ifu cant find that flavor tho because it has chunks of food in them   but stage one or two single ingredients are fine     then after fruits and veggies u can move onto meats and try flavored cereals  and u can also do mixed food     but introduce a new food every 3-5 days to see if there are allegries   my son is five months old   and he gets breakfast lunch and dinner u just increase the intake of food to get to that point     and if there still hungry after there meals give them like a 2-4 oz bottle to top them off     good luck   i love doing solids       they also may not like a highchair so sitting on anything inclined will do the trick   like a bouncer   swing   carseat   joey wouldnt eat unless he was in his slant chair for the first while|`|dfe6c334e9209f452ad6c98b5a766df3aa	usually you start with rice cereal or oatmeal cereal for babies. just a tiny bit. and this is at about 4 months. the directions for the first feeding is right on the box. then usually you start the solids at 6 months. i started with veggies so they get used to them before the sweeter tasting fruits. i started with sweet potatoes and carrots. things like that. then went to peaches and bananas and such. get the tiny jars. the first stages ones. good luck:) this part is so much fun:)|`|5dd9bf73027613730d9b5dd66d6c68daaa	I started my daughter on baby cereal (rice and oatmeal) mixed with some formula.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Lots of people are going to suggest with rice cereal, although this may not actually be the best beginner food.  You can start with fruits or veggies and ditch the rice cereal.  Start by mashing ripe banana and offering, or puree some peas or well boiled carrots.  If it seems to thick, thin out by adding a little water, formula, or breastmilk.   There is no reason you need to start with rice cereal.  Its just processed and refined grains, which really aren't that healthy.    I personally waited until 6 months to begin solids.  And from there we progressed very fast onto table foods.  My son has eaten everything that has ever been offered to him.    Just offer a few bits to begin with foods, and let them lead the way.|`|zwctZ812aa	You can start them on rice cereal at 4 months if the doctor said they are ready for solids.  That should be the only "solid" you introduce for the first while...I would say until 6 months.  Through doing my own research, I have found that it is actually better to hold off until 6 months to start solids, but if your doctor said 4, then I'm sure that is fine.  You may want to call the pediatrician and ask them about baby oatmeal though.  I have heard it is easier on a baby's stomach and causes less constipation than rice cereal, but I'm not sure if it can safely be started at 4 months.|`|2pxiK9waaa	A lot of people start with oatmeal or rice cereal because you can mix breast milk or formula in with it to get them acclimated. However, there have been no studies done to show that this is beneficial. You could start with veggies, fruits, or meats should you want to, although many will argue that if you start with fruits, your kids will be more reluctant to try veggies. Just make sure there's only one ingredient in whatever you start them on so you'll know if there's an allergic reaction. For example, try Stage 1 Bananas, not Bananas and Pineapple Stage 2.     Make sure your girls have had their bottles and then try it so they're still getting the majority of their nutrition from the formula. Introduce new foods one at a time and space them out 4-5 days between new foods to make sure there are no allergies.|`|lXaAFIHfaa	I agree with Shane veggies first. If babies eat fruit first you will have a terrible time down the road trying to get them to eat much bitter veggies. Rice cereal is also good. My 3 kids all started getting a few tsp's at bedtime at about 3 weeks. Have fun!!|`|mCbhjcLuaa	I was like a bird with my kids (i would chew things up first) until they got teeth.  It was so cool to see their reaction to different foods.  You could just go the baby food route.  But it is so much more fun to expose them to the things you like and watch them develop.  Mine are 19 boy and 22 girl and wonderful people  I sure miss those days, hope you have a good time.  .
5ZvALiclaa	No its quite the opposite actually. Your hair become thicker and softer and you usually don't shed much at all...<br>  <br>  its after the birth, usually between 4-6 months after, that you will lose all that hair you acumulated while being pregnant.<br>  <br>  also your finger nails get really strong and your skin usually looks ultra healthy too from all the extra hormones<br>  <br>  congrats on the baby!|`|5Lru7rNraa	do you mean losing hair?? if it is than yes, I'm 27 weeks pregnant and have been loosing a bit of hair, but it also grows extremely quick and thick so you don't notice anything, if anything you have extra hair and that's everywhere!!|`|j7fzuDxgaa	my hair was falling out whilst i was pregnant with all 3 of my children, its nothing to worry about. i guess for some people its after the baby is born either way i would not worry|`|jiTKnCKpaa	No your hair doesn't fall out as much in pregnancy and usually gets thicker|`|RuKK1LYiaa	all three times when i was pregnant instead of my hair doing what most websites say it would do it did the opposite, i swear i could have made a wig out of all the hair i lost so it can really go either way.

KHZLPldraa	I went for a 4d with my daughter at 15.5 weeks and we could easily tell the sex!!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	You may be a bit early, but everyone is different.  Most women usually scheduled them around 26 weeks where I worked.|`|AA10458750	It is the best way & definatly more accurate than regular ultrasound. They will be able to see the gender, but they say the best time for one of those is 27-30 weeks. Of course, maybe they have a package deal and you could go back then too. Good Luck!|`|fPAlfokHaa	I think most people would recommend leaving them until 28 weeks or 30 weeks because i was going to get one then figured if i was going to leave it that late then i may as well just forget about it! :)|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	It's fine as long as that's all you want to do. They can do gender determination at 15 weeks with a 4d ultrasound but the look of your baby won't be as great as if you were to wait. I went at 24 week and I wish I would have waited until the 27-31 weeks like they recommend. I do see why you would want to go though, I don't think I could have waited that long to find out what I was having.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Yes- I had a 3D scan at 18 weeks and at 21 weeks (I am high risk so I get them every few weeks) and at both times the face was not filled in yet.  Most babies just don't have enough fat on their face to look very attractive.  They look a little sickly and strange that early on. You will likely see the sex just fine at that point.  But if you want a good face picture then wait until at least 24 weeks.  My 24 week scan was fine.  But the scans at 27 weeks and 30 weeks were excellent.

To start with, I wasn't keen, but now I really like it. I prefer it to Morgan, a name I like better on a girl.|`|SRIaRm08aa	morgan    and i know morgan's that are boys and girls. The name works either way to me.  And yes, it is unisex.|`|ayDPhjGVaa	Morgan, and only for a girl.|`|zIAeznSEaa	Hm, I like them both  It's quite hard, but I think Morgana will probably just get called Morgan anyway  I like Morgana better, and if you change your mind you can always just call her Morgan|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Morgan. Morgana just looks misspelled and made up.|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I like Morgan for a girl and it is the best version!|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Morgan - I know a guy named Morgan and he is very good looking and I do not think of his name as feminine at all. I love that name for a guy or a girl! Nice choice!|`|yNuGrHsRaa	Morgan|`|256cVXsmaa	Morgan definitely, although I personally love boy names for girls, SO CUTE.  Morgan is an adorable name and It's not insanely common|`|5DK546BUaa	Morgana - reminds me of Morgan le Fay, the powerful sorceress and antagonist of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere in the Arthurian legend. Provides a fun story for the name ;-)|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Hmmm, I I like Morgan better. I like Morgana a lot, but it seems a bit "heavy", if that makes any sense.|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Morgan is feminine, people my age (old ;) think of Morgan Farichild the actress.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	morgan for a girl|`|Qd26D4kiaa	I like Morgana|`|mp8XgvFDaa	Morgana that is if it's for a girl.  if its for a boy, i suggest picking a completely new name so s/he wont get made fun of.    Morgana is more unique then morgan & when she gets older she can decide if she wants to be nick-named morgan.    win win situation :P|`|X9T9iVVhaa	I like Morgan better|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I think Morgan is better... Morgana just sounds made up to me|`|ljFBfguRaa	Morgan, def sounds feminine|`|CxRJwJsraa	well, I LOVE Morgan for a boy and can handle is as a middle name for a girl. But really since I like it so much for a boy, I'm not really big on it for a girl.    However, I don't think Morgana is all that pretty.
iVcaB9h7aa	You will find information on the process here:  http://www.theadoptionguide.com/process/    and information on the fees here:  http://www.theadoptionguide.com/cost/    Fees for a domestic agency/private adoption run $10,000 - $30,000+.  International adoptions can cost more than $30,000.    The process can take 1 - 5+ years.     Consider adopting through foster care.  I cannot speak of the process personally because we adopted with the help of an agency, but there are many knowledgeable foster parents and former foster children on this forum.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	As soon as you contact a certain foster home, they will tell you exactly how much it'll cost. The thing is that every place you go to will have a different price, so it all depends on which one you'll go to.    Hope I helped!|`|gEBBpvlFaa	Foster-to-adopt is free in your county.|`|qMZ1f9duaa	well for me personally, the process took a little more then 4 years. and the final costs were 38000, we did international adoption though. the waiting period for international adoption usually takes alot longer but we were lucky. it wont take that long at all for in country adoption. you might even want to check your local government website for information about the local adoption agencies|`|1B0NXz7Laa	We are looking at about 15,000. And a long wait!|`|5SCKHiPAaa	If you go through your local DHR, then it should be fairly free. What I mean about fairly is that they say it is free because they do the homestudy and all, but you still have to have your medical forms signed, which means you must go to the doctor, and so on, but it hardly costs money to go that way. Depending on what age you want to adopt depends on how long it takes to have a infant/child placed with you with DHR. Then the parents' rights have to be terminated before you can go through the actual adoption process. So the wait time for finalization can be long.     An agency can have many fees. Anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000, plus adoption expenses. Catholic services is usually pretty cheap but the wait is long. I believe it is about 10% of your income. A lawyer can also vary. Some lawyers here are crazy and can charge up to $30,000, which is insane. Some lawyers like ours, charges less than $4,000. A friend of mine adopted for less than $700! You have to call around, find out the hidden fees, check the wait times and see what you feel comfortable doing, money wise and wait time. When we adopted, our homestudy was only active 2 months when we adopted. We have friends that have taken a couple of years to adopt domestically. There really is no set time.     I just really think there is no usual cost and wait time with adoption. Good luck!

Good luck. and hope for the best.|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	The chances of you getting pregnant a few days after ovulation are very slim. Although, if you had sex a few days BEFORE ovulation, your chances are even more increased. Check your dates again, make sure you ovulated when you think you did. Also could just be PMS

I've included the link below so you can read more about it. Good luck!       Treatment for low sperm count depends on the cause. Your doctor will carefully test you, but sometimes an exact cause is never found. Even when this is the case, your doctor may still be able to recommend a treatment that will help you and your partner achieve pregnancy. Your doctor will also want to make sure your female partner has been evaluated. Treatments to boost female fertility can help compensate for low sperm count  and increase your chance of pregnancy.|`|AcOVnKtlaa	Hi there,    To be honest, age has an effect on fertility in men.One research study, looked at semen quality in normal males and compared the quantity and quality of the sperm and semen to the men's ages. The study look at everything a semen analysis would include as well as how often they had sex since sexual abstinence also has an effect on semen quality. In the study, they found that, overall, semen quality peaked between the ages of 30 and 35, while overall semen quantity was found to be lowest after age 55.    But, what if the man is also older, though? Does age make a difference? Compared to constipation problem, age does not matter.In your husband case, the exact condition of his physical strength is important.    Among all concerned about how to increase sperm count, one thing is sure that to produce healthy and adequate sperms, the overall health should be perfect. Your husband should adopt nutrients/foods that help attaining stronger, healthier ejaculations. The foods that boost testosterone may help increase his sperm count.     More details about what kind of foods your husband should take are on source articles.
fUC4wCCEaa	Do you know about the Munchkin Fresh Food Savers?  They have a mesh bag you can put food in and a ring for baby (or you) to hold.

You can also get these homoeopathic teething pills that just dissolve in their mouth, but I have never tried them and not sure of the brand, but have heard they work also.  <br>  My doctor also suggested peeling a cold carrot- not baby carrots though because they are too small- and give that to him to chew on- it is cold and sweet so your baby might like that- just make sure you make it big enough for your baby to hold and also watch to make sure he doesn't shove it too far it its mouth- to prevent choking.  <br>  And they do make small teething rings, so you can try those too if you like.<br>  I hope this helps and good luck!|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Hylands make teething tablets that are small and dissolve in the mouth.  They are safe, and they are a lifesaver.  you should be able to buy them in any store.|`|3R9VIkrSaa	Try wetting half of a wash cloth and freezing it, then let him suck on the cloth after its frozen. This worked for my son when we'd go to grandma's and didn't have a teether.|`|LFtGP9baaa	the best thing ever are teething tablets. you should be able to get them at wal-mart or walgreens (other places as well) they will dissolve in his mouth as soon as you put them in so you dont have to worry about him spitting them out|`|BUPqM4e3aa	use disney naturals drops they are great!

r52rfBkeaa	I would establish a night time routine with her, like snack, bath, story, nurse and then put her to bed.  Repeat this every night until she realizes that one leads to the other and it ends up with her sleeping in her bed.  I wouldn't stand there until she falls asleep anymore and if she falls asleep standing, let her learn that she'll fall and wake up.  She's in her crib and she'll be fine.  She'll probably cry for the first few nights, but if you go back in every time she cries, she'll never learn that it's time to go to sleep.    She's waking up in the middle of the night so I'm thinking that maybe she hasn't had enough to eat before bed?  Maybe try giving some solid food after dinner but before nursing, maybe a banana or some other fruit to help get her through the night.  If you try this and she's still waking up, let her cry for 15 minutes.  It seems like a lot, but if she's crying for attention, she'll fall back asleep before the time is up.  If she's dirty or hungry, she'll keep crying and you can get up to change her and/or feed her.  Keep the lights out (use a hallway light) and don't talk to her.  Move quickly and quietly.  You don't want her to think that this is a time to play and nursing at this time of night shouldn't be fun or comforting to her anymore.    We did this with our son (and still do when if he wakes up) and he's slept from 10pm - 5am at 6 wks old, 8pm - 9am at 4 months!|`|87e8184f643ec4cb00ae7615748f1da2aa	I've co-slept with both my kids and they don't seem to be ready to go to a "big person bed" until they're about 2 years old.  The 'cry it out' method is proven to be psychologically damaging to a child.   Unless it truly keeps you awake to have her next to you, what's wrong with co-sleeping?  My babies nursed at least once at night until they were 18 months or a little over.  Good luck!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	first i wouldn't put her in bed with you at all, not even to nurse....i used what i called 'controlled fussing it out' ; baby has needs met, put in bed; you go in and check on them while they are fussing every few mins so they know that mommy is there if they NEED  something, but not for WANTS...it will be hard, and if u give in once, it will be a lot worse the next time around bc she will keep steppin g it up a notch until she realizes things have changed....when u go in, u need dim lighting, no eye contact, no talking, do NOT get the her out of the crib, PERIOD. u can give a quick few pats or rubs to reassure baby and then leave....point is, be boring as hell....keep your routine the same; but be consistent, stand your ground, and she will figure it out, they are much smarter than often given credit for...at over a year, she should be able to settle herself to sleep; i don't  know about falling asleep standing up, but make it safe for her to fall and let her do it, she should learn that it isn't a lot of fun......
2arZOZWgaa	Here is what I would do: Put her to sleep like she is used to. When she wakes up, give her a chance to fall back asleep on her own. Try not to intervene until it seems necessary. Don't give her the breast unless you feel like she is hungry. Try putting her back to sleep with patting, rocking, calming her down, singing to her, whatever works for her and you.  It would be OK for her to whimper and whine for a few minutes.    You should try to determine what is waking her up. Maybe it is because she is in bed with you? I am all for co-sleeping, but sometimes it means that mom and dad end up suffering from a lack of sleep from kicking baby. At around that age I had to transition my daughter to her crib because everyone was waking everyone else up. Once she started sleeping in her own bed, she started sleeping for longer periods of time. Once you can figure out what she is waking up, eliminate the threat.    If you are very tired, I would enlist the help of dad. If you are working and he is working, then take turns every other night. One night you get up with her, the next night he gets up with her. Or you could even do every other time she wakes up if it is say three or four times a night. Having his help rocking her (or whatever it takes) back to sleep will break her from wanting the breast to be comforted. At seven months, you can find other ways to comfort her other than sucking (maybe a pacifier if she is that adamant about sucking?).  Don't give in! It could take a few nights or persistence, but it should definitely do the trick without being cruel.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	maybe she is teething? you might think she is too young but it usually takes a month or so for the tooth to actually come out.If his/her gums are swollen then that's the problem you can try teething tablets. If that is not the case maybe you should try feeding her baby cereal or oat meal the baby just might not be full so he/she wakes up and since your breast are soothing for the baby then he/she falls right back to sleep. You can also try a pacifier i think 7 months is a little to late to get them on it but if you are ok with this idea it might work but make sure you try everything else first, you don't need to get the baby use to the pacifier if you can avoid it then i wouldn't even open that can of worms. Good Luck! Hope i helped!
hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Tessa,    You can call 1800-4 A Child (National Child Abuse Hotline)   Someone is available to take your call 24/7.    Document anything that is abusive, dangerous, neglectful, etc. to present to the proper authorities.     Take photos of any injuries or things that back up your claims.    Keep telling people until someone does something to help your friend and her family.     Here are some other resources for information, advice and support:  http://www.childabuseprevention.org/  http://childabuse.com/  http://www.child-abuse.com/|`|CM1QTLOgaa	you just have to keep calling dhs. but if that still doesn't work, call the police and explain the situation. the police will definitely take action.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Like the post above, keep contacting the DHS, otherwise give the police a call.    Unfortunately, if the mother of your friend does not want have her parental rights taken away your friend will not be able to adopted, however, your parents could become foster parents and raise your friend. Then once your friend is of legal age they will be able to decide whether they want to be adopted by your parents or someone else for that matter, or to let things be as they are.  Cause once your friend is of legal age they will not need their biological mother to sign over parental rights because well your friend would be an adult and old enough to decide for themselves.     Best of luck.|`|UPtWwVYsaa	Okay what you need to do is have the friend that the mother hit tell the child services. From there she will need to tell them EVERYTHING that goes on in the house. If she tells them how abusive her mom is and that noone is happy there they will take her out. Even if she does love her mom this needs to be done. Its the best for everyone.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	Funnily bipolar people can function very well if they taking medicines very regularly. This woman needs to get on her meds !!!    My good friend is bipolar and her toddler since birth is being raised by her in-laws. I used to feel angry with her for not raising him herself. After reading your story and how she could be danger to her son if she became irresponsible about her meds i see her point.
AlbJmy7aaa	Not necessarily "wrong" it comes down to personal preference. Do as you like.    You can always ask  if its bothering them.    It is possibly illegal in many states (soon to be more), including California.|`|lO2Nvj81aa	I think it is.  It's kind of a form of child abuse, if you ask me, and it should be illegal (if it already isn't).    I think it's wrong to smoke in the car with anyone else who is a nonsmoker though.|`|iWOjZcbLaa	u shouldn't even smoke in the park with you baby... and the pollution give a good job instead anyway... so don't smoke with him/her... never|`|wdyf1sueaa	Newborns, how the heck do you find time for smoking, head on to the hospital fool, be quick about it  !!!|`|epAFmug9aa	it is just fine, if you want them to experience severe eye, lung, and ear problems throughout their childhood. At least roll down a window, or wait until you can stop and light up.|`|W7YShek1aa	I have gotten asthma from my step mom smoking in the car. so no|`|qygYwdRpaa	Yes very wrong you risk exposing your children to all kinds of problems and im sure you dont want that to happen, so just wait until your out of the car to smoke.|`|CPsk9Mybaa	Yes! Smoking around your babies can cause a number of health problems and has been linked to SIDS.|`|VlP7ESH1aa	Oh my GAWD yes! they have smaller lungs: smaller lungs that are faster filled with smoke. this can kill your child by resulting in lung cancer. and, it shows them that smoking is ok.|`|pTG1JuDbaa	this is a silly question i smoke and i know i cant smoke in the house or the car with my baby|`|G2auAv1Saa	While there are potential health risks, most children lead normal lives with parents who smoke.   My parents used to smoke in the car while we road in the back area of the station wagon without our seat belts of course by baby sister was strapped in her metal car seat back there with us (my parents weren't heathens) and we're all still alive.      Jillian.... breathe with me. It is ok for a parent to make their own decision about their own child. Babies have not changed a bit in thousands of years. I have no idea why in the past 10 years all these bad things have begun to happen to children when in the past they have been raised in the same way without the same consequences. I child can still have a normal life with smoker parents. None of my siblings have  had ear infections or health problems- and only one of us has ever smoked. My parents health is also fine. I am 34 years old now and if I had a problem it likely would have been spotted by now. Do you watch the news? Everything causes cancer or some type of harm to your body if we eliminated all of those we would be stuck with just water.... wait nevermind it has fluoride, guess we're all doomed. Yes, smoking does cause some illness- people who don't smoke also get those same illnesses. People have to relax about their children and quit being scared by everything. Those newborn babies are built the same way they were 50 years ago... back when the maternity ward had smoking room for the mothers.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Well, it depends on what kind of cigarettes they are - do your babbies have a preference to what to smoke?  Do they enjoy rolling their own or normal cigarettes?  Do they enjoy smoking with you?    So, it is only wrong if you get the wrong kind of cigarettes and if they prefer to smoke on their own I guess.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	wrong- yes. exposing your child to second hand smoke without their say is kinda wrong     PLEASE mrs hererra- who cares if you seem ok- it doesn't make it right- many people smoke them and don't get cancer but does that make it somehow not bad for them? my aprent's smoked around me and now they don't smoke around my little brother- they learned their lesson by the continuous ear infections the first 6 kids had- now at number 7 didn't get a single cold until he was 3-4 years old|`|lzivF4Idaa	the first answerer obviously didnt read the questions right cuz newborns lack the ability to tell parents what is bothering them....silly newborns.     yes, it is wrong.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Not only that, but its also bad for their health to smoke and be around them under 20 mins. from you smoking a cancer stick...20 mins after you have smoked you are still exhaling toxins and smoke...not to mention, your clothes and hands....  Thats why it pisses me off when people say, "yeah, my kid has asthma, Do we smoke? yes but outside or where they are not around..." SHUT UP! you know you dont...|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Yes, it is wrong.    Secondhand smoke is particularly dangerous to young children because they breathe more rapidly than adults and their lungs are still developing, and are more susceptible to the kinds of problems caused by breathing such pollutants. Studies also suggest that children who breathe secondhand smoke on a regular basis are at a greater risk for serious ear infections. Other studies have shown that children who breathe in secondhand smoke regularly are much more likely to contract asthma and other breathing disorders than children who are not exposed to such smoke. Further, especially children six and under and especially babies who breathe in secondhand smoke are significantly more inclined to acquire respiratory infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis.    http://www.topix.com/forum/topstories/T0...    And against the law in California, I'm not sure what other states...|`|vjsT8DMIaa	whats sad is you can spell cigarettes but do not know how to spell "babies".|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Well,I don't know about you,but I won't be letting anyone near my kid with their cigarette smoke!|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	I myself, coming from a family of smokers, who used to smoke in the car when I was a child, find it wrong.  I hated it so much.  Plus I'm sure it's not healthy for newborn babies as well.  Is the health of your child really worth it that you can't either wait till you get to your destination, or if you really have to pull over somewhere safe and have a quick one while the kids are in the car?|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Look at it this way...    Would you hold a cigarette to your babies mouth?  Even at 10 years old, would you let your son smoke?  Dont be a jackass, even smoking one mile away from your child, the toxins adhere to your clothes, hands, hair and skin.  When you hold your baby it passes those toxins right along.|`|2sXqm4u9aa	Do you really have to ask that question.  It is wrong on many levels, you can smoke all you want - I smoke too.  Newborn babies do not need to be breathing smoke of anykind especially cigaretts.  They wind up with asthma, respiratory distress, etc.,  Plus they don't have a choice.  I don't smoke around anyone especially children.  I go outside and smoke.  I KNOW WE ARE STUPID FOR SMOKING WHY MAKE OUR KIDS SUFFER?  They can't get up and leave since they are babies.  You can, you are the adult and are suppose to protect your babies any way and by any means necessary.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Well, since you asked, I hope you won't think it judgemental of me to say yes.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	In Ontario Canada it is illegal  to smoke in a vehicle when a child under 16 years old   http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/st...|`|jJxUCkkFaa	YES!
F4FJVq37aa	15 weeks is plenty of time for the baby to learn his voice!|`|TVgLSwpJaa	It sounds like your husband will have plenty of time to talk to the baby when he returns.  If your husband is there for the birth and after, your baby will form a bond with him.  The baby will then really know daddy!  Enjoy your pregnancy and don't worry, your baby will recognize daddy!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	not immediately, but I'm sure the baby will get used to it and eventually realize that its his father. I'm almost 8 weeks pregnant, and my fiance is deployed overseas, when he comes home the baby will already be a month old, but I'm certain that our child will still know who its father is.  |`|vwuMTm7Saa	It is really sweet that your baby daddy wants his baby to know him.  Don't worry!      "By week 25, your baby begins to hear your voice  and your partner's  and may even recognize those voices as early as week 27. Sounds may be muffled, though, because the ears are still covered with vernix, the thick waxy coating that protects the skin from becoming chapped by the amniotic fluid."    Looks like daddy will be back just in time!|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	no but after a while will get used to him.|`|1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	well as long is he is there when the baby is born and growing up, course he or she will know there daddy,baby's don't usually hear in the womb till around 30 weeks anyway, good luck with the rest of the pregnancy|`|6avKnzkoaa	I'm sure the baby will know who its dad is. If the baby also always has dad holding him and stuff once he/she is born, he/she will most likely know that, he is he/she's dad =]|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Johnny T- I do believe she was saying she is now 17 WEEKS pregnant not her age.     And yes your baby will know his dads voice. Kinda corny but the farther you get I would stick the phone up to your belly so your husband can talk to the baby.

If he goes away again, and you're still worried about it, have your husband make a tape of his voice, or have him call and just say hi every once in a while. Don't worry.|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	At 20 weeks I began to notice that my baby is very responsive to my voice and her daddy's voice. So think by 25 weeks is good timing. I'm now 21 weeks and she kicks or moves whenever we speak to her.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yes they say the baby can't really hear until around 20 weeks anyway. Try putting the phone to your belly or having it on speaker so your baby can hear the voice also. They say by 20 weeks your baby can hear a loud t.v. so im sure it should hear someone over a speaker phone. and even if he/she can't then you can at least feel like you tried.|`|g6IgHavwaa	u have loads of time yet, its the last 3 months when the baby can hear things like the daddy talking! and for the last 3 months if he is not around what u could do is get him to tape a message to the baby and u could play it to your belly through earphones then baby will know his voice.    at the moment im 27 weeks and ive started play soft music to my baby every second night, its said that when baby is born and i replay the music it will be very soothing.    Good luck with the pregnancy, you should do u a pregnancy blog on this site. u can make your own personel profile add pics, blogs and chat to ppl due same day as you, very helpfull plus good way of your partner to keep track of your pregnancy. e-mail me if u have any other questions or just wanna talk.

Both my children were 10 days late and I fully expect the third to be late as well.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I might deliver early but that might just be wishful thinking.  My midwife told me that there's a good chance I'll go over again if I've already had a history of it.  The truth is, due dates are only speculative and baby will show up when he or she is good and ready.

The top kinda stuck out but the bottom never did.|`|8qw0Cdqiaa	I've gone through two pregnancies and my belly button never popped.  Not sure why.  Doubt it will this time around too.  That's just fine by me as I like my belly button just the way it is LOL.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	I also had a rather deep innie belly button; it was sticking out by about 7.5 months.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	mine has not come out but i am also 25 weeks pregnant  i can tell that my belly button is a little more closed up.|`|3cada643ca7c82ded9c0fd90df0755b8aa	Hi. I'm 37 weeks right now and my belly button still has not popped out.  It doesn't happen to everyone.

OFgXjyilaa	I love it!!!<br>  <br>  It sounds really cool and mellow but masculine and cheeky at the same time.|`|AA10747963	I don't think it is feminine at all. I know a Corey who is husband of my teacher. He is so nice, good looking and has a good paid job, and of course he is a good husband and father of two kids. They are such a beautiful family. I know name doesn't affect one's personality, character, looks and anything that happens to one's life. But I just have a good impression on the name. I don't even have a bf right now but I often think which name is good for a baby. and Corey is always on the top of my list :)<br>  <br>  In short, yes I really like the name also!!!|`|cDnjNw6Qaa	I like Corey. It's a boy's name.

I'd prefer Cody or Cole or Colby or Coby.|`|73R5Pcr5aa	It is a nice name and it does sound a little feminine, but you are right it is a boy's name|`|oWdNHaRGaa	I really like the name corey because its a strong name and i has a manly ring to it|`|hIoxij6eaa	Its a nice name.|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	i like it, there are a lot of coreys around  nothing wrong with that name|`|OnPTofJcaa	Definitely NOT feminine at ALL.

My 9 year old son's best friends name is Cory.I don't think it is girly at all.I think it is a great name for a boy!!!|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Nowadays people get confused becasue so many people are using boys names for girls. Corey is definitely a BOYS name (ummm...Haim and Feldman).

DIuE4vshaa	You need games, they are easy to find online. But you also need a place to host the shower, prepare the decorations, and have food and drink for all the guests....which you need to invite with mailed invitations.<br>  <br>   Start a notebook with addresses and phone numbers. You'll need them for the invitations and for help.<br>  <br>   Good luck.<br>  <br>   Oh, I forgot, you need a really nice baby shower cake. This will  cost some money to throw this but that's why you need to ask for help. You can't do all this alone. Who would decorate the hall  while you ready the food or games?|`|PwHWJkcYaa	1. Sneakily get a full list of invitees' from the hubby<br>  2. Make invites, print them on your computer, buy them or get them made. It is traditional to have the party at your home.<br>  3. research games such as 'guess the baby food' and ' Who am I' online, prepare everything you'll need for these games.<br>  4. Bake a cake or buy one. Try to get candles in the colour of the baby (ie: girl-pink, boy-blue, don't know-white)<br>  5. Invite her round 'for coffee'. <br>  6. HAVE FUN!<br>  You might even want to try a fun game my neighbour tried:<br>  because the 'guest of honour' can't drink alcohol, buy a wide variety of fruit juices, some sugar, stirring sticks, crazy straws, unbrellea, cherries, lemons, limes and lemonade. <br>  Get everyone to mix 'mad' combos of the juices and lemonade, top with a straw, umbrella with a cherry on the end for fruiter drinks, a lemon or lime wedge, sugar round the rim of the glass and a crazy straw for more citrussy drinks. <br>  Then name the 'cocktails' and drink them as your 'signature drink' for the entire party. (Just makes sure everyone tries all the combos!)|`|NOVLHX3Maa	This web page provides some good general tips on baby showers.|`|sFNNDqhGaa	Well there is not enough space to answer this :)<br>  <br>  1. Decide theme or not? <br>  If a theme, then match decorations and activities to the theme. <br>  <br>  2. How diverse is the group attending teenagers through grandma? <br>  ie - Basically the wider the age group the more relaxed the event, meaning no wild and crazy games involving movement that would send Grandma to the hospital. <br>  <br>  3. Will there be kids and do you need side activities for them? <br>  <br>  4. Food - Keep it simple, supply a basic menu with a few specialty items. If people ask to help, invite them to bring a dish.<br>  <br>  If you do need some games here is a full list of 50 baby shower games. Plus they have printable ones too.<br>  <a href="http://partygameideas.com/baby-shower/games-list.php" rel="nofollow">http://partygameideas.com/baby-shower/ga...</a><br>  <br>  Do you pay for it all? <br>  Tough one, in most cases you can ask others to pitch in however they are not obligated. <br>  <br>  See if you form a group and split costs, pull in a few friends and see if Betsy can get the decorations, Jody favors and prizes and Michelle beverages, etc... this is a polite way to involve others and defray costs. If it turns out to be you alone, then set a budget and do your best. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  Sarah|`|7bdhpvc9aa	This site gives you detailed information. Hope it helps.

Z0I5Qvk7aa	I'll be completely honest with you. PCOS is awful. It's frustrating because no two women will exhibit the same symptoms, so even though there are many women out there with PCOS, sometimes you still feel so isolated because it's such a unique disorder.<br>  <br>  For instance, I'm insulin resistant, have skin tags/darkening of the skin, skipped periods, and anovulatory cycles. I do not have thinning hair, nor do I have a ton of excess hair. Many other women combat those issues, but may not share the same symptoms I have. <br>  <br>  Know this, though. PCOS is manageable. I take herbal and dietary supplements (Cinnamon, Chromium, B-12, Fish Oil, Calcium). I work out an hour everyday, and I follow a moderately low carb diet. It has helped immensely. <br>  <br>  Even with trying to get pregnant, there are so many options. Losing weight is one, if you are overweight. Then there is Clomid, which is sometimes taken with Provera if you don't have regular cycles. Beyond that, there is obviously in vitro, and things along those lines. Some women become pregnant simply from taking Metformin.<br>  <br>  Again, PCOS sucks, but you can deal with it. Do not be too nervous. If you have it make sure you find a doctor who knows what PCOS is, and how to treat it. If you're trying to get pregnant, go to a reproductive endocrinologist. <br>  <br>  In the mean time, there are numerous support boards for PCOS, and sites that will give you a better understanding of what PCOS entails.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you don't have it, but if you do, you're not alone :)<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  www.soulcysters.net is an incredible support board. There is also a young adult section where you can talk to others your age range that have been diagnosed with PCOS.|`|AA10254927	Ok here's the thing... my tests were FALSE.<br>  My gynae did my bloodwork and said I had high sugar and put me on diabetes meds saying I am a possible case of PCOS.<br>  I panicked and got all sorts of ultrasounds done... and now 1 yr later I am 7months pregnant!!<br>  So take it easy on urself. Even if the tests are positive, doesnt mean u CANNOT be pregnant. Just that u'll have to be more diligent and might have to take med help to conceive.<br>  <br>  Just please dont let ur morals down. It does BAAAD to u!! <br>  GoodLuck
6PEOqeLOaa	Just because the baby was not in the same location does not mean you are having twins. However, i am not saying it is not possible that you are having twins. The baby is constantly moving even early on remember they are in a bubble not attached to any specific points in your body. Im pretty sure each time i have had my baby's heart rate checked its always been in a different location. Good luck! your ultrasound shouldnt be to far away only 6-8 weeks away!|`|ux6j2OIeaa	Your baby will be moving a lot!  You may or may not be having twins, if you are measuring big (i didn't) then there is a possibility.  If you are that concerned speak to your doctor and ask if you can get an early scan.  I didn't know until a scan at 23 weeks that i had twins on board. <br>  Initially when i told my Mum i was pregnant she sad "wouldn't it be funny if you were having twins!"  I thought i was having a girl and ended up with 2 boys.|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	It definitely could have moved that far. But, sometimes moms and grandmas just know.|`|3p0QBNpwaa	What did your doctor think? <br>  Are you messuring big?|`|Noi5aU22aa	twins|`|mlwBLJHaaa	yeah
r39EDGhPaa	Your happiness should come before making your sister happy. You've obviously been there for her for a long time and she knows you love her. SHE got pregnant, not you. She shouldn't be holding you back.    Move with your boyfriend's family if that is what you want to do. Your sisters pregnancy should not even play a role. She got herself knocked up, of course her mom is going to fight with her a lot... she did a stupid bullshit thing which is stressing her mom out as well. You don't need to be around that either, none of that is your fault.    Your sister did something stupid and now she is getting hell for it.  You didn't do anything.  If you love this guy, and you don't go with him, then you could end up resenting your sister for holding you back.  It's up to you, but I'd leave.  If she wanted to be an idiot and get knocked up, that's not your problem, it's hers.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	Get back together with him. Its obvious you won't be happier with anyone else. Just because your not living with him doesn't mean you can't be going out. I agree that you should move later. Like, in a year, or a couple of months after the babies born (if she's keeping it). Keep a long distance relationship with him until you can move, when your family business is cleared up.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Is there any way that you could stay with your sister through her pregnancy and then move over with the other family at a later date?|`|bQu4A2awaa	um if this is possible :  -stay with your sister until she has the baby and help her get settled into motherhood. (like make sure she is prepared and everything is okay)  -then move in with your bf at a later time. after everything is good with your sister.|`|wTMMG0enaa	well your sister looks up to you and you don't think she'd be able to be strong without you around..i think you should stay, your sister needs you more, you could always help her with the baby and you could try to get your mom to lighten up a bit, as for james, well there's always other fish in the sea, im sure he'll understand and get over you once he moves to the other side of the country and meets new people, both of you could remain friends and try to stay in contact with each other because long distance relationships never last or work out.|`|pdzfq7ojaa	A lot of people are saying that it's your sister's problem, but if it was me I would want my big sister there with me, but she also probably wants you to be happy.  Are you and your sister close?  Are you in love with James?  Will he wait for you?  It depends on who is more important to you: your little sister or your boyfriend.  Personally, my opinion is that boys come and go, but sisters will always be there.  However, you need to consider what you could be giving up by not going.  If you really do see a future with James, then maybe you should go.  Then again, if he won't wait until after your sister is settled for you to move in with him, then maybe he's not worth it.  Sorry for confusing you even more.  I am just trying to show you that it depends on who is more important in your life, among other things.  This is what I personally think you should do:  Stay with your sister until she has the baby and is settled (anywhere from a week to a month), then move to James' house.  If he won't wait a few months then maybe he's not worth it.|`|MOsStEbqaa	What would you regret more? Leaving you sister who got herself in the position she is in now or someone who could be the love of your life? I think that if you stayed that you could end up resenting your sister and that wont be good, and i know from when my sister got pregnant at 15 and my mom and her fought once the baby was born it all change and it worked out. I think that you should could with him.|`|VbUpMxrvaa	Well..it's up to you in the end. No one on Yahoo knows the whole story, and you shouldn't leave your decision up to a stranger.   The way I see it, if you feel like you're going to marry this guy, then move with him.  If not, then stay with your family.  Not to sound harsh, but if your lilttle sis can't handle the pressures that go along with being pregnant maybe she shouldn't have had sex at 15.   It's not your problem & it's not really your job to fix it.  Sure, it's a nice gesture.  But you have to focus on your life too.  Good luck.|`|gKllAGmnaa	well its your life to live so go with your bf james, before u go give your sister some advice on life. so have fun and i hope for the best|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Okay im in your position right now.  And this is all my opinion.    I'd stay with my sister. I wouldnt jsut leave her. If  i really did love that guy and he lvoed me back. He'd wait for me. Or hey he could mvoe in with me?     Spellnig erros i know. To lazy to fixx them|`|GUFb4TZVaa	dont move! personally i dont think u should, because you seem like you are a good support to your family, plus, do you really want to miss out on your neice or nephew being born etc..?? would your boyfriend not consider moving in with you instead ?? why don't you's even rent your own place?|`|nsGBwXCTaa	you should do what makes you happy. I know they say blood befor water but sometimes you have to do what your heart tell you to do . Your sis will find thing that will make her happy and if you stay and when she find the right person do you think that she will  stay becaues of you , but just do what will make you feel batter do not do what people wont you to do      Brandy|`|wzXJOSIeaa	You should stay with your sister. She needs you right now. As the old saying goes...If you love someone let them go, if they come back it is meant to be. That saying has proven to be true many times. And besides I'm sure your sister would stay if you needed her.|`|RvOilUZjaa	stay with your sister. this isnt ignoring yourself, its realizing that a 15 year old girl needs the support of her sister.   All i know, is that I'm 15, and if i got pregnant and my sister left me, i may never fully forgive her.  1. why is James moving?  2. if James really loves you, you can wait for a year until your sister has given birth and is settled into her new role.  i hope you do what's right.|`|rzeJ9TZsaa	hey my name is leah and my favorite channel on TV is 33|`|aPN7NsvXaa	In all honesty, your sister is making her own bad decisions with or without you, obviously.  All children are a gift from God, however, at 15...they are by no means an original part of the plan.  So...if you leave, I don't see how it is going to change the situation.  Your sister will have the baby and either keep it, or adopt it.  But, you cannot live her life for her.  You need to be happy...and where I do believe we need to look out for each other, we also cannot make other people happy if we are not truly happy ourselves.      Good luck.  Have fun with James wherever you end up.
5ItOGyVHaa	ok, day 1 is the FIRST day of your period.<br>  <br>   from there have sex day 9-11-13-15<br>  <br>  give him a day to re-suppy<br>  <br>  average women ovulate between day 10-14.|`|CmLDcfMfaa	If you have sex everyday it will lower his sperm count.  It took me a year to conceive with both of my children.  I finally bought a basil [sp?] thermometer so I would know for sure when I was ovulating.  I have a friend who use to teach child birth classes, she had the best luck by telling when she was ovulating when she had a white sticky discharge, that is what finally worked for me too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	If you know when you are most fertile I think youve just answered your own question lol.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	You need to have sex every day from the 10th to the 16th day of your cycle.  Your cycle starts on the first day of your last period.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Have sex a couple of days before your ovulate and every day during. They say having sex every other is fine as sperm can live a few days inside a women. All the best :)

PwHWJkcYaa	Well, due to a heart operation I had as a child, I may not be able to conceive. I will have both the option of IVF and having my eggs frozen and implanted. However, I will never have a natural birth. It is for this reason I am 100% behin IVF. It is cruel andf unfair to expect women to 'just live with childlessness', when there are options avaliable. I will even be able to have IVF on the NHS as the illness I suffered and my current lack of fertitlity is a result of their having never performed the op on a girl that young before. Therefore they destroyed my fertitility and have agreed to pay for the IVF and frozen implanted embryo's should the need arise. <br>  I hate to think of all those wonderful women out there, unable to concieve, who would make fantasic mothers and when I read about teens or abusive women getting repeatedly pregnant, it makes me sick. A baby is a privelage and one that all women should be entitled to!|`|YzUPmWTBaa	If I could afford it, I would do it.|`|rCjRRDF5aa	It can be very expensive and emotionally draining for people to do it, but personally if I end up having difficulties conceiving and I can afford it, I would at least give it a try.|`|ukbQNqKxaa	are you dum well that what i think by the way you answer all of my questions dont be so dum
5N3odm3Qaa	You may be able to get pregnant immediately. It depends when your body ovulates but after a D&C your cervix is still open for a while. That makes getting pregnant very easy.    Women are most fertile in the weeks and months after being pregnant.    There's a great chance that you could get pregnant again very, very soon.|`|37CXY8Jdaa	I am sorry for your loss and I know exactly what you are feeling.My husband and I finally got pregnant after trying for 11 months. We were so happy and there was nothing that could take away our happiness, until my second prenatal appointment when there was no heartbeat. My OB did a sonogram to confirm the baby had not survived past 9 weeks and I thought I was 12 weeks. ; '( I had a D&C the very next day just 3 days before our first wedding anniversary and I just felt so desperate to get pregnant again. I  was told by my Dr. to wait two months before trying again and I did just that. almost exactly 4 months after the D&c, I found out I was pregnant again! I am currently 18 weeks pregnant and everything seems to be ok with this pregnancy. I never lose faith in that I would get pregnant and have a healthy baby. Believe that you will again and try not to stress and think about it as much and it will happen. Sorry again for your loss and God bless!|`|eXcXhSmIaa	dont know if its quite the same, i had an eptopic and had to have tube removed, took me 3 months to concieve again, and all is well 8months on! good luck

I had Pre-eclampsia from 30 weeks, and my headaches were horrendous =[ <br>  Do you also have a funny vision, Like dots or lights? <br>  Nothing took the edge of. <br>  Hope you are ok??? <br>  people will probably think i'm being crazy, but sometimes Pre-eclampsia is very hard to detect!|`|8mxF01Psaa	I had really bad headaches in my third trimester. Turns out I had high blood pressure and had to be induced. Go to the doctor and see what they say. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|D33VRTz8aa	I would think its not related to the pregnancy, but it would be better to speak to the doctor or midwife.|`|j24dvYaraa	Headaches and vision disturbances are two signs of preeclampsia, and high blood pressure is also another symptom of it. I suggest you have your blood pressure checked and your sugar too. Better go to the doctor for your peace of mind. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dancingbeauty.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dancingbeauty.com</a>|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	ring your doc or midwife asap, headaches in pregnancy could be a sign of pre-eclampsia. try not to worry though, it may be nothing- but its always best to get these things checked out when pregnant|`|f0c14af9cf77a6bb68c4ffdbb372cdacaa	I can really sympathise with you.  I suffered with migraines during pregnancy and nothing helped.  Paracetamol was the only thing I could take and in the end I didn't even bother because I knew it wouldn't touch it.  Here are a few things you can try to ease the pain.... try lying down and keeping your head still, place either a warm or cold towel on your forehead and the back of your neck, cold helped me but you might find warm better, have a shower, the warm water on your head tends to help and gently pull your hair, place your hand on your scalp and gently pull your hair upwards.  I hope some of this helps you, none of these things will take the pain away but it does ease a little bit.  I was given an injection of Nolotil at one point because the pain was so bad.  It will be worth it in the end but I know when your head feels like its splitting in two it doesn't feel like that....good luck with your pregnancy.  Oh and incidentally my headaches tended to last four days and then I'd have a break for a week!
DPegPYRPaa	Try Meetup.com!  I know it sounds funny but this place has a lot of groups to chose from, including single mothers groups and they have times and dates they get together. It is a great way to meet people in your area that may be just as lonely as you!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Take a class at a local college or an aerobics class at a gym. You need to get out, and you can learn something new, or do something you love, and meet new people.|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	it's HARD to be a single woman, especially when you're always so busy and tired from parenting.    I wonder if you've looked into some kids' social/play group type activities. That way you can attend with your kids, and while the little ones are busy you can chat a bit with other parents of small kids. At least that way you'll be starting with something in common, it won't be a big pressured environment, and the kids are having a ball even if you don't meet a new best friend (or a really handsome single dad...)    keep your chin up. better times are coming.    good luck.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Look for part time weekend job where you can meet people. Or volunteer when your kids are with their dad. Meeting people is not that difficult if you put a little effort into leaving the house.|`|AA11755924	I know how you feel.  You lose yourself in your kids and you put yourself on the bottom of your priority list...    You gotta reach out on a limb here.  Find someone at work that you are kind of chummy with and invite them out to happy hour one day when you don't have the kids.  Be a little forward - the first time will be hard but once you see how much fun it is it will get easier...and the group will probably start growing.  Make it a regular thing!|`|s1zitZMOaa	I'm not a single mom but I think I understand how you feel. A few weeks ago we had a babysitter and while my husband and I were out eating dinner I told him I felt like I had no identity anymore. I'm not really one to get out and meet people either and we moved to a new state 2 years ago so I really don't know anyone here. I told him I wanted to get involved in something so I could have something other than just being a stay at home mom and he asked me what I wanted to do - I didn't know and I couldn't even answer him when he asked me what I was interested in. I finally decided to take some cooking classes. And I have really enjoyed it so far.     I would recommend that you find something in your area that you are interested in. If your kids are with their dad sometimes then find something that meets during that time - some type of class, the gym, local libraries have book clubs, writing workshops, and all sorts of discussion groups. There are also all sorts of outdoor groups in even small town - cycling groups, kayak clubs - just start googling and see what's around. If you join a group full of people that like to do something that you also like to do then it should be easier to make friends. Don't be nervous and don't put it off - just get out there and do something so you don't feel like you're feeling right now.|`|AA11119076	Do you have any interests like sewing or sports?  If so, see if there are any groups for that in your area; the town recreation department should be able to tell you.  Community colleges are also a great place to meet people so if you've been wanting to try something new (an exercise class, photography, etc) that is a great place to find people with similar interests if you can make the classes.|`|GUFb4TZVaa	why don't you go to the gym, exercise really helps to lift your mood and if you book on a class such as body pump, you might meet some really nice people there? there are loads of classes available... arts...flower arrangements etc...or y don't you use the internet as a social network?? go on a friends reunited site and catch up with some old friends? hope this helps
Fd4lITkvaa	I did do skin to skin although didn't plan it. I felt the same as you. I thought my son would be placed on my chest with a hospital gown on to protect me. As he was crowning my doula started to pull the gown off of me. I wasn't sure why but was a little too busy to care. My son was placed on my chest as is and I didn't care a bit. Right after he was placed on my bare chest they wiped him down and checked him over, right there on me. After they were done they covered him with a blanket and stuck a hat on him and he breastfed for the first time. It was wonderful and I am glad things went the way they did.    You get over the blood and goop in the moment. I know several women that felt the same as us and they all were ok with it in the moment.|`|QvQmeUKhaa	Just tell the reason and I don't think they would care.  I only got the option to reach down and touch my baby when he was born because I lost so much blood that I passed out immediately after delivering him.  I think they would understand if you asked them to clean him off first.  Although cleaning him off will only be the heavy stuff and then they wrap him in a blanket.      P.s.  Trust me I don't think you'll have the same reaction when you see your baby covered in blood and stuff.  You won't even care if baby has doodoo on him/her...you'll still want to hug them :)|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	My daughter was cleaned almost immediately after birth. I was able to touch her when the doctor laid her on me, though. However, within the first half hour of her life we were breastfeeding, the way I had wanted. I don't know why, but for the first month or so, I only dressed her in her diaper unless we were going out. So we did plenty of skin-to-skin. She's sixteen months now, and come to think of it, I miss it. Sigh.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I didn't have the option because my son was born with 1, 2, and 1 apgar scores, but they revived him right away and as soon as he was okay (about 5 or 7 minutes) I had him on me and tried to get him to feed on me.  We did skin to skin until he was about 5 months old!  He LOVED IT!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son was not bloody when he came out- he was just covered in the white vernix stuff. that was kinda nasty but they cleaned him off a little while he was on top of me|`|dfe6c334e9209f452ad6c98b5a766df3aa	they will at least wrap him or her and clean out his airways first. so they may just clean him or her off at that point. i had a c section so i'm not entirely sure. but i didn't  get to do this until the next day or so and it was the best feeling in the world! but who knows, when you give birth and see him or her and they offer them to you, you may not even care:)|`|r52rfBkeaa	The nursed wiped my son of briefly before handing him to me, but they didn't wash him yet, just got the major stuff off.  I was wearing the hospital gown so he didn't touch my skin and he was also wearing a blanket.  He was there only a moment and then taken to the bassinet next to me to be weighed and measured, etc.  They asked me if it was ok if they took him to see the pediatrician and to bathe him and bring him to me afterwards.  I said yes and then they took me to recovery.  By the time I was in the recovery room and all cleaned up myself, they brought him back to me and we started nursing right off the bat.  I wanted skin to skin contact too, but so much is going on when you're giving birth that frankly, it's not going to matter much.  You'll have your baby back in your arms in an hour or two and then you can hold him/her however you'd like!|`|yCwPxulYaa	After you work that hard to get that baby out, you will not care what the baby has on it.  I just wanted to hold my baby and hear that cry. I promise you that you will not care.      The doctor will wipe the baby off when it first comes out anyways!  But like I said you will not care what is on that baby.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	They aren't going to bath your baby right away, period.  They have to make sure the baby is able to maintain their temperature first.    Babies have very little blood on them at birth, normally.    I really doubt you are going to care in the least about a bit of vernix, not mucous.    I had my second in the tub, at home, and I wouldn't change it for the world.  Right after birth I got up (naked of course) with my son and went to the bed.  After about 15 minutes I birthed the placenta then we had a nap.  Eventually he nursed.  Then I had a shower while my hubby kept baby in skin to skin contact on the couch.  My baby was 37 weeks and had constantly low temperature so he basically had to be in skin to skin contact at all times or else ridiculously bundled up with hat, sweaters, blankets, at least two sleepers and an undershirt, etc.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	They didn't touch my baby before I did skin-to-skin.  That immediate bonding time is very important.  I also nursed immediately, and I encourage everyone to do the same.  The doctors praised me for it, saying they wished all mothers chose the same route...speaking of both the skin-to-skin and breastfeeding.  She was rested on me and we were both covered with a blanket (after the doctors got there...the only people present at the delivery were my husband and the nurse.  Even so, the nurse wasn't prepared and my husband ended up "catching" her)    Both of my children were rather clean when they were born, but even with the bit of white that was on my daughter...no one paid any mind to it.  I hope you would choose to do skin-to-skin and immediate breastfeeding...    If you wait until after the baby is wiped off or not...I hope you choose that.    Edit:  Write a birth plan, for sure!  It can contain anything important you want the birth team to do.  Give it to your doctor to put in your file for the hospital.   When you call to say you are on your way, they will take out your birth plan and read through it.  Anything else you find important, you can tell them when you arrive.      Have you considered having a Doula?  I find them irreplacable.  A great asset to our team!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I made a birth plan before labor and they asked what I would perfere.  I said I wanted him placed on my stomach right away without being cleaned off.  If you do choose to have him placed on your tummy right away, they will clean him off some during that time anyway.      I ended up with a c-section, so I didn't have that opportunity, but I wish I did.  They aren't going to look at your crazy, they will do as you ask.  But, I bet ya that you are gonna want your baby right away, you won't think twice about them being cleaned off or not,  in fact, they will probably have to pry your babe out of your arms for the first bath....lol!      Its your birth experience though, and you  have every right to have it how you wish.
Plzrj6J7aa	when i went for my 20 week scan to find out the sex of the baby i had to drink loads of water which was hard cause i have to pee every 10 mins lol<br>  <br>  and i went it had the scan and all the baby did was show its bum and they coulnt tell what sex it was so i had to empty my bladder which was brill lol<br>  <br>  and the baby had moved and it was a boy!!!|`|5ZvALiclaa	yeah when i hopped up on the table for my 18 wk scan with my last baby he all of a sudden woke up and decided it was play time! He was jumping all over the place so i had to wait for a bit and then we tried again once he had setttled down. <br>  <br>  Very frustrating i know, at least i had it redone that same day though|`|nyuB4POqaa	yes I had to go back a second time, because she just didn't want to be seen <br>  lol i thought it too sweet|`|hIoxij6eaa	Yes. the sonographer was pushing and prodding to get him to move and got me to jump up and down on the spot, go to the toilet and still he didn't move. I had to go back the next day and they got what they needed. Its probably really common. The upside is that you get to see your baby more :)|`|dKyi5MLKaa	yes my cousin did when her baby was born she was so camera shy<br>  <br>  please answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AofmaWNCtlxqj_6korbNt6bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225010254AAUi7so">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Yes :) it seems that they like to hide.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	you have a smart one there lol. mine tried to hid her gender from us but she gave in eventually. good luck

g9ZFjl6paa	heres your answer!! its sick and wrong!! obama supports this..for all we know his wife did it thats y!!       Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby's leg with forceps.         The baby's leg is pulled out into the birth canal.        The abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.         The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's skull. The scissors are then opened to enlarge the hole...        The scissors are removed and a suction catheter is inserted. The child's brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The dead baby is then removed|`|MgvYMfIWaa	if you want to know what an partial abortion is you should look it up. its not something women like to think about.|`|5vBpKmNcaa	A partial birth abortion is our 43rd president... President Obama is the solution to it|`|JFjimf4daa	Partial Birth Abortion is just what it sounds like. The baby is carried to term, usually around seven to nine months. The mother is then given a labor inducing drug to start the labor pains. When the baby moves into the birth canal, the doctor repositions it to come out feet first. The feet, legs, body, and arms are delivered leaving the head inside the mother. The baby is alive and doing all it can to complete the birth process, but the doctor has a nurse hold the child with the head still inside the birth canal while he gets a pair of scissors and inserts the scissors into the base of the baby's skull, severing the spinal cord and killing the child.The government psychos in Washington has determined that as long as the head is still in the birth canal, the child is not a child and Partial Birth Abortion is not murder. Now you know.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	Google it. It's sick! And Obama supports it....what a great man.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	basicly the head of the baby is born, they stick a scisors or spike in the babies skull before they remove the rest of the body from the mother.  then the baby is left on the table to die. If it survives, it still is abandoned in a nother room to die.    look it up if you dont' believe me... libs like to say its ok because it is not completely born yet...|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Ya do some research. Any abortion in my opinion is wrong, but partial birth abortion is the worst.|`|9fb8dd613b6d7669a254e54dfa56167baa	http://usliberals.about.com/od/healthcar...|`|JzGDBkZWaa	Basically, partial birth abortion is abortion performed after 20 weeks which involves 'dismembering' the fetus. It's not like a medical abortion where a woman takes pills and has miscarriage like symptoms. This type of abortion is more involved and generally frowned upon because the fetus is more developed and more (dare I say it?) 'baby' like. Barack Obama has voted AGAINST banning partial birth abortion.

(FYI - tylenol is the brand name for acetaminophen)|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	Giving infant tylenol drops is perfectly safe.  You should follow the directions ont he bottle unless your pediatrician has told you otherwise.  You can also use baby orajel to rub on his gums.

The night time formula has a little more of the active ingredient and helps the baby sleep.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u don't say how old baby is; call your doc's office to get the correct dosage instructions or a pharmacist; but please don't take anyone's advice on YA bc they don't know your baby or anything about his developmental stage, etc....ask doc!|`|r52rfBkeaa	I gave my son half of one dosage, to the 4ml mark, until he reached the weight requirement for a full dosage.

2xS1Jro7aa	Children do not lie about things like that. How old is your child? Could they be learning about it in school and think that maybe him cleaning her in the bath was sexual abuse? Ask her exactly what happened and take her to the doctor to have her checked. I would believe her though and get her out of that house until you know for sure. She should always be  1 on your list! Good luck!|`|8oAlBL91aa	Wow I hope this didn't happen to your kids.     Little kids wouldn't just think that up off the top of there heads. It's a cause for concern and you believe you children every time.    I would take them to the emergency room asap to have tests done to make sure there isn't any damage and catch the b*stard red handed.|`|780ByZVEaa	i would have no clue what to do but to be on the safe side i would trust my kid|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Young children do not lie about these things.  So I would absolutely believe my child.  I cannot imagine my husband doing those things, but we would be having a serious talk and counseling for the entire family.  Possibly, the kids and I moving out for a while until I knew my children were safe.      My children's welfare comes first.|`|DPegPYRPaa	I would take them to a doctor and have the looked at. There are usually signs if they were sexually abused. Just do it quick. I would also sit in with a counselor and talk with them separatley and then maybe together. This is not something I would take lightly. I would listen to the child until you can prove otherwise.|`|0WstfAmzaa	I wouldn't know what to believe at first, but I would trust my kids to not make up something that terrible.  Their abuser would be kicked out of the house, my kid taken to a doctor right away and go to counselling as well.    And I would definitely press charges.. Doesn't matter if he's my husband or not.. I'm not going to let my kids ever think that it's okay for someone to do that.|`|TqCHYkqJaa	First would be in shock and then i would ask my child in what way does he sexually abuse them what does he do to you. i would not say anything to the husband i would keep a close eye on him. Why would your children lie?|`|MpqNJ6sWaa	hi sunshine, i dont really know, my loyalty would be to my children, but it would depend on the age and situation, young children never lie about these things, but there was a case i read locally about a fifteen year old who accused her father because she was not allowed to go to discos, she sadly thought with him gone her mother would give in, it went to court before she admitted the truth, but the whole family broke up soon after, this is rare i know, but as i said i would believe my children first as abusers are very cunning at what they do|`|VCCKfT3taa	You HAVE to give them the benefit of the doubt. If they are lying, then punishment can be exacted according to what you think is best. But if they aren't, there isn't any way to make up for the damage that could be done by ignoring such a problem.     I've seen first hand what happens when sexual abuse is ignored or denied. It's horrible...|`|74ad1812bb9388cabb50f7e72d934a29aa	Believe them. They must feel that you believe them as if its happened, they need to know they can trust you. Please, please dont not believe them. Take them to the doctor and take it from there.

Then before your 20 week scan you will feel worried to but after that scan it feels even more real.

I had to go back 4 weeks later because they couldn't get an accurate date. I went again expecting the worst but it was fine again. I paid for a scan at 18 weeks! I had my 20 week one stillexpecting bad news but again it was fine! I read too much on the internet about missed miscarriages etc. I'm now 28 weeks and a bit more relaxed because I feel her moving. This is my 3rd baby and I have always known I was pregnant immediately but not this time. Try to relax but I know how hard that is. If it makes you feel any better,missed miscarriages are rare but I still thought I was one of those rare examples. Good luck tomorrow.|`|hIoxij6eaa	Welcome to motherhood! Its part of the job description to worry about your children. I was terrified at each scan just in case this time they would find something. I was terrified right up until I actually gave birth and I had my beautiful healthy baby snug in my arms. Now I'm worried about their welfare on the outside! It never ends :-) You'll be ok, but you will be blown away when you see your bub up on the screen. 12 weeks your baby looks like a proper little person... an absolute miracle. Take tissues!|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I know how you feel as i have had 2 miscarriages. when i went in for my first scan with this pregnancy i just chanted "please god let it be ok" the whole time over and over in my head. Good luck and try to get some sleep it will make the time go by faster! Keep in mind that not all women get nasty pregnancy symptoms and mine were actually worse with my second miscarraige than with my healthy pregnancy!|`|D33VRTz8aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Don't worry Its natural. I used to get very tired too. I am sure everything will be fine. You will forget your worry when you see the baby on the screen.  :)<br>  <br>  Its an amazing experience. I was feeling really scared too. I will not tell you today what i used to think. I'll let you know after your scan tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|Plzrj6J7aa	i was convinced it was bad news and nothing would turn me i even papared my self for bad news and although my husband said it would be fine i thought to myself hes so worng and hes going to be deverstaed when if finds out , but i went for 12 weeks scan and there it was bouncing around in my tummy, and although i dont feel pregnant what so ever and feel great which i didnt with my first i know that everythings ok, theres so many things to go wrong but you cant think like that you will drive yourself mad trust me i know, the only thing that helped me was i bought a little guadian angel pin and i wear it everytime i go to seee midwife or scans and it just gives me that hope i need and it got me through with my son and hes 2 now and healthy as ever<br>  <br>  hope this helps hun and your not alone theres millions of woman out there that are worrying just like you
AA11327039	At that age and weight I was told anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 3/4 teaspoon.  The half teaspoon dose is for every 4 hours and the 3/4 teaspoon dose is for every 6 hours.    Also it depends on what is wrong with the child.  How severe are the symptoms and such.|`|Nti8czLvaa	I would go by your daughters doctor, and look to see what the packaging says.|`|myEwHgI1aa	5cc or 1 tsp
r52rfBkeaa	In order for her to be interested in feeding herself, she has to like what you give her and be able to eat it herself.  Sliced banana (don't have to puree them), sliced strawberries (also don't have to slice), dices peaches, diced cooked apple, small pieces of pasta (like macaroni or spirals), the Gerber snacks that dissolve in their mouths, mashed potatoes or even small chunks of cooked potato, corn, green beans... you name it!  Just make sure it's cooked (except for banana, strawberry and peaches), that it's soft and that it's small enough for her to not choke on, but big enough for her to grab.    Sit with her when she eats and encourage her to eat what you put in front of her.  If she tries it and spits it out, try something else.  Keep trying the things she spits out at a different time or different day b/c babies can sometimes take awhile before they realize they like something.|`|ENANtueuaa	It's not because of the amount of teeth she has. Have you tried any of the Gerber snacks? They have fruit puffs, that are great to start out with. They are a little bigger than cheerios, so it's easier for them to grasp, and they disolve quickly in their mouth. They aren't as bland as cheeiros, so maybe she'll be more interested in eating them. Put one in her mouth to let her know what they taste like, then see if she'll do it on her own. You can even put one in her hand, and guide it to her mouth to show her what to do. Also, it's normal for them to want to throw them off the highchair, sometimes even while they are eating them. Just leave them on her high chair and keep showing her, she'll pick up on it quickly! Hope this helps!|`|kpxw2ygVaa	i know it hard not to compare your child with other children but believe me all children are different. my daughter who is 6 took to feeding herself with no problems at all. however my little boy who is 23 months is still struggling to feed himself (to be honest i think he's being lazy). he started with finger foods no problem. i left them on his tray and he would pick them up. but he still cant hold a spoon or fork to scoop food up, i have to put the food on the spoon and then pass the spoon to him. just put your daughter some finger foods on her tray and see how she goes. it may take awhile but just be patient. also when you have something to eat for dinner just blend the same for her. but if your daughter does have the same meals as you just leave out the salt when your cooking it.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	First off, its got nothing to do with teeth.    Although teething can affect their want or ability to chew because it causes discomfort.     Some babies are ready for finger foods before other babies.  Your daugther may not be interested in them yet, and that's okay.  Just continue to offer them,  and eventually she will catch on.  Be sure to start with finger foods that are easy to grasp.  If her pincher grasp isn't perfected yet, she may have a hard time picking up something as small as cheerios.  Start with bigger things that aren't too slippery.  Banana discs can be good, but can be slippery and frustrating to try and pick up.  Diced cheese is a great beginner finger food, as is spiral pasta noodles.    Good luck and be patient, she will do it when she is ready.  No need to be concerned.  Don't compare your baby to other babies as well, because they all develop these abilitiess at different times.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Don't push too hard for her to do it. She will in her own time. I had to show my son how to eat. Start with something you know she likes such as bananas. Cut them up nice and small, pea size if you have been smashing them, and place them on her tray. Take a piece, stick out your tongue, place the banana on your tongue, and chew in a bit of an exaggerated way with your mouth open so she can see what you are doing. Next take a small piece with your fingers and offer to place it in her mouth. If she takes it great, if not let her play with a few pieces and smash up the rest and feed like normal. Try once a day until she gets it.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	If you put it in front of the babby with a babby spoon that they can grasph with little hands and then the colors will also be stimulating to the babby so the ywill begin to eat on their own.

5PqD4k3Raa	Ashley-<br>  <br>  First of all dont freak out. Stressing yourself out will cause you to think your pregnant.  You ovulate about day 12 of your cycle and it usually last a few days ( fertile days). if your not to sure when all this is just think the middle of your cycle ( if you have a 28 day cycle its day 14 etc).<br>  <br>  Cramping is just from the stress. It is too early to see ANY changes. Your veins are popping out because of your stress. This IS normal.<br>  <br>  Don't freak. Wait and see, take a test.<br>  <br>  The more you stress the more your going to freak out!!!|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Where were you in your cycle when you had sex? Were you at your  most fertile? (Around day 11 - if day 1 is the first day of your last period) Even if you did conceive the embryo would not have embedded into the womb yet.  The best thing you can do is try not to worry, and take a test on the first day your next period is due.  Don't try doing one too early, it wont necessarily work and they are expensive!<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out,<br>  <br>  Claire|`|1u4CS5J3aa	its way too early to tell. the fetus wouldnt have implanted yet or it just has and you woulndt be having symptoms yet like that.

YzUPmWTBaa	Yes you can. Breasts are usually tender during ovulation, and only start to get tender again later on in the pregnancy. Swollen breasts are a great sign too! Good luck and lots of baby dust. Email me if you have any other questions or just need someone to talk to. Mwa
56731a9ade7bcca40d3c6063bb258c1faa	I've had PCOS for years. Try Metformin, it helped me get pregnant after I got off the BCP. It only took a month and a half for me.

Im 27 weeks along. Maintain a healthy weight, eat healthy. If you are over weight talk to your doc about metformin. Its a diabetic med that might help with PCOS weight loss that will increase your chance of conceiving. My OB also told me that clomed is an option for PCOS if you try for too long with no results. Good luck
O9orj8IQaa	Implantation bleeding is basically your egg trying to find a snug place within the uterus. <br>  <br>  You could check this site out, it explains all the possible sources of bleeding during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/Pregnancy/bleeding-in-pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/Pr...</a>|`|OFgXjyilaa	The best thing you can do is try and relax. i know it is extremely hard but when i was pregnant i nearly drove myself crazy reading sites all the time. If the bleeding continues or if you have any sharp pains contact your doctor immediately.<br>  <br>  I got pregnant with an I.U.D in place and found that my G.P wasn't taking it seriously and wouldn't listen to my concerns. I had some bleeding and contacted my local hospital which scanned me immediately. Unfortunately I lost my baby but the point is, it's YOUR body and you know yourself better than anyone. If you are concerned make sure they listen to you until you feel happier.In the mean time take a couple of days of work, lay off the housework and relax.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps? Best wishes. x|`|VhCw4Pvyaa	i had that with my first pregnancy. Just little spotting.

vAYPTTZEaa	well it depends on if its coming and going, constant or if it was just the one time. Its normal for that to happen right after having sex, pregnant with my third and ive never had sex during my pregnancies without that happening right after. Sex makes you contract. Semen softens your cervix and orgasm makes you contract. If its coming and going then you should def time them to make sure your not in labor. Specially if its painful. If it is painless then its most likely braxton hicks..|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Its normal =) It could be braxton hicks though =)|`|xeS8pUfbaa	im 31 weeks too and i have never had anything like that happen to me.. i guess it may depend on your position, if you are doing it from the back and stretching out your tummy muscles i can see how that may hurt a little. i have had 3 braxton hicks contractions that i know of, and none of them hurt, they just feel like the baby was trying to stand up inside of me. like she was super stretched out.. i dont think that braxton hicks would happen because of sex but you can only know for sure if you talk to your OB|`|1JHE8coDaa	Very normal and most likely braxton hicks contractions.
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Yes, that is labelled abusive parenting and if I knew where you lived I'd probably report you. I was working in a shelter once and we had to contact DHS about a mother who was locking her daughter inside the house with a lock that could only be opened from either side with a key (which the mother kept with her at all times). That is a very dangerous thing to do. If there would have been a fire your daughter could have died not being able to get herself out of the house. I can't believe you did that, there are better ways of getting your point across than to willfully put your child in danger and force her to soil herself.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	yes.    WTH is wrong with you?|`|dbgf2Vuhaa	Thats alright just go up to her and say im sorry and ill always love u. because now she"ll relize wat ur going to do next time.|`|FOYcKE7Zaa	i'd definitly say so.    you do not LOCK your child in a closet to sleep,  even if it is a walk-in.    what you should have done was let her sleep with you that night,  or make a bed on the ground of where you were sleeping.  at least where you can see her.    if she needed to go to the bathroom, you should have given her 3 minutes. and had a parent go to the other side of the window, outside.    locking a child in a closet is definitly not the way to punish them.|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	that is crazy you cant be serious how does sneaking out have anything to do with you letting her pee what the hell?????? and locking her in the closet are you serious this has to be a plot for a movie about psycho parents....... that is just terrible! she probably snuck out because she obviously has NO FREEDOM she should tell child protection...|`|AA11537580	WHAT?  that's just wrong  shame on you!  you should have let her pee and you can not lock her in a closet!!  OMG that is just WRONG!|`|5i8rtlmXaa	with a teenager you have to find something to get there attention, if this worked then you Probably put the fear into her,although you should have gave her a bucket to pee in.and maybe got up around 6am instead of 9:30.I wonder how many of the answers have had to deal with a teenager?good luck to them when there undisciplined little grade schoolers grow up to be teenagers, they will go out on a limb also.unless they don't care if there kids are wild.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Yes, you don't deserve to be a parent.

aPN7NsvXaa	First you do better...actually try in school.  You might hate it now, but trust me...you will look back and say, gosh, I really should have tried.    Now...DON'T do what I did when I was in high school.  I got a D once, in Chemistry, and hid my report card for about a week.  I ended up grounded for 2 months...not becuase of the grade, but because I hid it and was deceptive.  My mom said it wouldn't have been so bad, had I been honest in the first place.  That was years ago...but parents are all the same!      Good luck.  But, you need to fess up and say you just didn't try.  And, you wouldn't dare make the same mistake, again.  School is very important to you.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	THE WORLD IS GOING TO END!  YOUR LIFE IT OVER!      Its a report card...

TPnDIaQEaa	Why do you think you are pregnant?  Have you been sexually active (have you been fingered or had vaginal sex)?    If the answer to one of those is yes then there is a chance.  Some women still get their period for a few months after they become pregnant. Take a test if you are afraid of pregnancy, it is the only way to tell. I would not freak out though, the chance seems like it could be very slim.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i know of one lady that had her period the whole 9 months its very rare and she had alot of complications during her pregnancies & delivery. so just go to your doctor it could be something else.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	Why do you think you are pregnant, first of all?    Second, you wouldn't have your period full blown.  It is possible to spot, but in no way would it appear as a regular period.|`|VbUpMxrvaa	That happened to one of my mom's friends.. but it's really rare.   Go to your doctor & take a test.|`|KlDoKDEjaa	no|`|JdqDauEDaa	It's happened before but it's rare. Why would you think you are pregnant?|`|3RrFu3NJaa	yes|`|LAanaXmraa	you can, but that's extremely rare.  see your doctor just in case.
UZYhNpFVaa	what is bcp? some sort of birth control im guessing..? but as far as being pregnant... way too early to start betting.  As for me, whenever I thought I might be pregnant, a pregnancy test only showed positive probably a week after I missed my period (even the tests that say they show 5 days early)... so- for now...ACT as though you are (cuz you dont wanna do anything that will be bad to the fetus if you actually are).. wait atleast a week till (after) you've missed your period, test again.. if it's negative, maybe seeing a MD would be the best advise because- from what I hear, eptopic pregnancies aren't always detected with pregnancy tests... and could be rather dangerous for the woman if nothing is done... I  strongly reccomend it, for your health =) hope that helps....good luck
1u4CS5J3aa	if you have been bleeding the whole month then is highly unlikely that you are pregnant.<br>  thank you for the clarification, if your period is past due its safe to test and get an acurate answer. there is alway an exception to the rule but id test away!|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	Just ignore the childish answers hun. did you maybe come off of contraception? im not really clued up as to why, but surely your doc should have explained why? i have a prob, came off my pill in dec, one period in early jan, and now nothing-neg preg tests....so now i just have to wait for AF to track ovulation....its like 48 days since i last had a period!<br>  <br>  baby dust sweetie|`|YzUPmWTBaa	I dont think you can be pregnant. It doesnt sound like you ovulate, and you really dont have a normal cycle. Have you been to a fertility specialist? If not, they are best able to find and treat whatever problem you have.

xcxMB4Rlaa	First of all, if you don't want us to pay attention to the fact that you're only 14, don't mention it.  Because truth is, once I started reading the question all I could think about was the fact that you're 14.  And that's what's influencing my answer.      Second, there are some things that you'll only understand after you've experienced them.  You say you love him and he'd stick around and even if you became an abandoned teen mother you'd be willing to take the chance.  Have you spoken to teen mothers about that?  It's hard enough being married with a baby.  I'm sure it's even worse when you add the stress of not having the father around, trying to finish high school and college, trying to hang with friends, trying to date, and all the rest that comes with being a teen.  It's not easy.      And then you say you're scared to get pregnant.  If you're scared to get pregnant you are nowhere near ready to be having sex.  I don't know specific statistics on the chances of getting pregnant when you have sex.  But in my opinion it's a 50/50 chance.  Either you do or you don't.  It all depends on how careful you and your partner are about preventing pregnancy.  But those are pretty high chances if you're not willing to take either outcome.  And while it's nice to know your family will support you no matter what, you don't want them to be your sole source of caring for your child.  You need to be prepared to take care of that baby 24/7 financially, physically, and any other way it needs to be cared for.  If it's your child you need to be prepared to care for it.      I would suggest that you continue to date your boyfriend and enjoy being a teenager.  Hang out, have fun, and enjoy the lack of responsibility.  Then when you're older, more mature, educated, financially stable, and married, have as much sex and as many babies as you want.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Personally, I believe 14 is too young. I think it's great that you have found someone you want to be with for the rest of your life...although divorce rate is like 50%. Which that percentage gets bigger the younger you are. You can't get married until you're 18, so why don't you wait to have a baby until then?|`|qImMwhUHaa	It is acceptable, in my opinion, to start having sexual relations with your partner when you become legally married to your partner. A boy can ask you to marry him with true intentions but life changes, people change and circumstances change. You don't want to end up a single mom on welfare looking for a good man to take in you and your kid.     Statistically speaking, the chances of you getting pregnant are unknown because your circumstances are unknown. If you are not on any form of birth control then the chances are very high. If you are on birth control then the chances are substantially lower, however if you abstain from sexual intercourse then the chances are none. You honestly don't want you family taking care of your baby. When you have the experience of having a child you want it to be with a man you are in love with and living in the same house with and able to financially take care of your child and hopefully married too. You won't feel complete any other way.
Ltb8K9YUaa	Actually none of that were my signs.  My only signs were period like cramps around the time my period was due and slightly sore boobs (after my period was due).  I did not have an increased appetite until I was about 15 weeks pregnant.  Morning sickness started for me when I was 6 weeks. I definitely did not start showing until 10 weeks or more.  Is it possible that you could be more than one month pregnant?<br>  <br>  It's normal for your boobs to hurt before your period.  I think your body is changing from the bc.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	if your on birth control theres a small chance your pregnant. it could be the pill side effects doing this to you. i gained about 40 lbs from birth control. this pouch you have could be you gaining weight. i say just keep taking the pills and if you dont get your period then take a test.|`|apSTH4TIaa	Stop drinking if you think you may be pregnant.  Everything you are describing fits pregnancy symptoms.  Take the test.  It is possible to get pregnant on BC if it hasn't taken effect yet when you have sex.  The first week or so that you are on the pill you are supposed to use back up method like condoms until it is in your system.  You may have become pregnant when you first started the pill.  If you find out you are pregnant stop taking the pill immediately and make an appointment with a doctor.  :)|`|ARevUipPaa	<a href="http://getinthis.pa-extra.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinthis.pa-extra.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|Kzeipwguaa	when i found out i was pregnant my boobs hurt really bad like i couldnt even hug someone. and i also had all day sickness not just morning sickness|`|gmwixwxpaa	i was in the bath one time, and i sneezed and what do ya know, BAM out came that little bugger.
uVxajsfIaa	Not sure, but if you eat the glucose level of your blood rises and this blood goes to your baby via the umbilical cord, that's why especially when you have something with simple sugars your baby will start moving around. Later on in pregnancy , when they put you on the monitor the check on the baby's heartbeat and movements they sometimes make you drink a little bit of juice, when i seems that the little one is napping during the monitoring. That's what they did with me  anyway, and it helped.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I'm not sure about actual time it takes to get to the baby. I have read that digestion slows during pregnancy due to hormones. However, I have also noticed that my little guy starts jumping around in there when I eat and drink. It's kind of funny and I joke with my DH all the time about how he must like the food.|`|SA1y0lm1aa	it takes about that much time 5 to 10 minets because some times you will eat till you are full but still feel hungery untill 5 or 10 minets because when the baby gets it you stop feeling it...lol that use to happen to me all the time would drive me crazy....
5ZvALiclaa	Yes, past about 6 months using the dishwasher is fine. Some people maintain that you still need to sterilise by boiling or other methods but its just not necessary anymore, the dishwasher does get very very hot anyway. <br>  <br>  Now the solids could be the reason for her fitful sleep. Her body is adjusting to the solids which means strange bowel movements plus gas and intestines having to digest it all. Give it time to settle down and you should notice a difference. <br>  Don't give the solids in the evening yet, stick to mid mornings after a breast feed so that she has time to digest it before her long night sleep<br>  <br>  good luck|`|NkuoOjU8aa	?αттι?α f?αg???σ ?ι ?ισ? è ?тαтσ qυι|`|dXVA1wHDaa	She should'nt be using bottles to drink juice from at all really, it can lead to tooth decay.<br>  <br>  What time of the day did she get her solids?

qUOaE4uLaa	is your daughter responsible?<br>  <br>  does she usually make good judement calls?<br>  <br>  is she easily influenced by peers?<br>  <br>  You should be asking yourself WHY she got it. Dont be soooo concerned with the fact that she has one. When I was 16 I got my tounge pierced and my mom found out later. I was not a bad kid at all. I made great grades in school didnt drink or smoke or anything. She was upset and didnt talk to me about the pain or anything. She just said I hope your tounge gets an infection.....i think you look sillly. I just blew her off but 5 months later I took it out and never thought about it again....it was stupid. <br>  <br>  my mother didnt punish me, she said sat me down and talked to me about it bc she knew i was mature, If your daughter is a good kid just talk to her about her adn let her know how you feel about it. If you feel like she lied or is disrespecting your wishes then tell her that. I honestly dont think its the worst thing in the world.|`|55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	Well, I'd be pretty pissed about it. 14 is too young for a tattoo. Hell its almost too young for makeup--almost.<br>  <br>  I'd probably freak out, and rest assured she would be grounded for at least 2 weeks. Go to school, come home, do homework, and to her room after dinner. No TV or cellphone for the entire time, all homework requiring a computer would be done with me.<br>  <br>  If the tattoo is something I find very offensive or just plain stupid (boyfriends name or whatnot) then I'd pay to have it removed, but you can be sure I'd make her pay every penny back. If she can pay to get it, she can pay to get it removed. If it isn't anything like that, then she can keep it. Whats done is done.|`|yUiydPReaa	she sounds like a good kid. don't take it to hard, there really isn't much you can do now. unless your loaded and can get it removed. remember there is a lotta peer pressure in school these days and she is gonna be one of the coolest chiks at school now. sorry that sucks but it so true! good luck, be easy on her....|`|Ccnf3xxqaa	Be very angry.<br>  Her skin's not even gonna be that shape in 3 years. It'll mess up.<br>  And she'll be stuck with some stupid thing she thought was cool when she was 14...<br>  <br>  Even if the place was "legit" I don't think they would have given her one, with or without an 18-year-old's signature... She's 14!|`|HLKb961Qaa	Freak out.|`|5QRIWopSaa	Take away her computer, and cellphone for at least a week.|`|Rt3Cl1MPaa	i would be mad but i would probably clear up from that after a while a couple of days|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i'd be pissed.|`|sVbZEWveaa	I would report the place who did it and the person who signed. They should not have a right to do something like that with someone elses daughter.|`|8XURx7nzaa	well legally you cant do that because she would need an id & the person that is 18 cant sign for her she would have to be with a parent trust me i have tried going and getting a piercing with my cousin & i needed a parent & an id|`|HOdblqIkaa	I would be upset. For one she did it behind your back. 2 she probably lied. 3 it was illegal for her friend to sign for her. 4 at her age 14 is way too young to get a tattoo she may like it now but I doubt shell feel the same way in 20 years. Just because she's a good kid in school doesn't mean she isn't doing other things and hiding them. She may not smoke and drink YET but she did sneak around to get a tattoo.|`|bfP8tjPKaa	3 OPTIONS:<br>  #1 [what i would do]<br>  Make her remove it.<br>  She put up with the pain to put it on, she can put up with the pain to take it off.<br>  #2 [what parents might do]<br>  Ground her until 18, seriously. NO friends over, NO going out<br>  #3[again,what parents might do]<br>  Let her find out at an older age how stupid it looks.<br>  <br>  question: ARE YOU THE "TEEN" THAT GOT IT DONE?|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	grades and everything are good, but u should talk to her and tell her that what she did was really wrong. i would tell her that she has to do something to gain trust again, and if she wants to go to a party or something dont let her, let that be her punishment. But dont over do it.|`|BySnX7Gvaa	I would probally laugh at her cause she wont want it forever.then i would ground her for like 3 weeks|`|1thzSbS8aa	There would be serious consequences for the tattoo parlor (who would probably lose their license) and especially for the "18-year-old friend" who dared to subvert my authority.<br>  <br>  Legal adults can be held legally responsible for ALL of their actions.<br>  <br>  (You know what a "legit" tattoo parlor wants to see before they tattoo a minor? A birth certificate. And the name of the person "signing for her" had better be on that birth certificate as one of the parents.)|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Rofl! Laugh, because I did the same thing, but I was 16.<br>  I would probably be pretty mad though, and speak to her about why she did it and why she didn't ask me.<br>  I couldn't do much without seeming like a huge hypocrite though...|`|p25p9jTYaa	i would probably sue the tatoo company and the friend. then i would tell my daughter that it was a cool =tatoo but she'd better like it because i'm not paying for the removal.|`|pzY0ARqDaa	I would be very angry with her. I would ground her, and have her get cosmetic surgery to get it removed, even if it is painful, at least she would learn her lesson and know not to disobey.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Thankfully, my daughter would never do that because she doesn't want to look like a trashy ghetto skank.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I'd be so freaking mad.

91hxNCfWaa	Test again in 4-7 days. Good luck! :D|`|apSTH4TIaa	Emily is right.  4-7 days test again and use first morning urine.  Sometimes if it is too early or a chemical pregnancy the test will be negative.  If you wait and retest the hcg hormone in your system will be stronger and the test will pick it up.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Yeah test in another 4 days.  I had a false negative when I tested 7 days after my period was supposed top start.  I then tested 3 days later and it was positive.  Now Im 21 weeks along.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	False negatives happen all the time.  You may have ovulated later than you think you did.  I would give it two days and if your period does not start and you still have symptoms take a test.
LDiBjNf5aa	The mind is a powerful thing. If a lot of your focus is on getting pregnant/the possibility that you may be pregnant, symptoms can be turned into real things for you. It's incredibly common - you see it on these boards all the time.<br>  <br>  I would trust the doctor, as disappointing (or as hard) as it may be. And try to relax. =)|`|C6oTOvOMaa	If your doctor says u arent pregnant, then u arent pregnant. they know what they are doing...U keeping thinking about it so your mind is playing tricks on you.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	You could just be sick or having 'wishful" symptoms.|`|Tr4Vj7RIaa	It depends on how far along you would be and what type of test was done.  Also there are other things that can cause nausea and cramping.  If you miss your period or the symptoms continue or get worse I would say go back to the Dr. or take another test.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	It is highly unlikely that you are pregnant, but it is possible.  <br>  <br>  A few years ago I heard about a lady whose doctor said she was not pregnant, but she was.   He was embarrassed at his mistake.|`|91hxNCfWaa	It could be too early, but I'm pretty sure doctors are good at noticing things. You could just be sick, but take a HPT in a few days/week.|`|Y1npBMS0aa	i guess there is a possibility. but maybe you should take an at home test for a second opinion:)|`|cooHcA5Kaa	a coworker did 3 HPTs all positive, when she went to her doctor he said she wasn't pregnant, she went home and did 3 more all positive - she had a baby in November - so it is not impossible, but hopefully it is not that usual of mistake either
2jiNLOKHaa	if you ovulated on the 20th, then yes it could be too soon to check for pregnancy. it takes a few days for the little guy to travel down the fallopian tube and into the uterus. and then a few more days to implant. two weeks after your ovulation then you should be able to get an accurate result that you can trust. i would waite at least 9-10 days after ovulation to take a test. so around march 1st then you could test. good luck! hope you get what you want.|`|EyKJ737daa	A home pregnancy test, YES too early but for a blood test, NO.  Blood tests are a lot more accurate and will be able to identify quite quickly if you are pregnant or not and of course you have actually had sex within that usually short window of opportunity.  Good luck and all the very best of luck|`|SA1y0lm1aa	not for blood work.....because the second your become preg you start making preg hormones and if you dont or dont have enof you will miscarry but it will take a few days more to show up on a home test......my hubby and i decided to have our last child and i took a preg test the next week because things where tasting funny and surprising enof it showed up.... so if it can show up that fast on an at home the im shure if you are it will show up in the blood test and if it wasn't possible the doc would not have done the test to find out....
3iSV1cKraa	yep a group of 17 year old girls who want to get pregnant to be cool, that's why i turn on the news! lol.<br>  <br>  hopefully they all got smart and went to college or something. i mean it wasn't a pact that was all denied, Time magazine called it a pact, thats all. teenagers getting pregnant really isn't news, it just occured when "knocked up" and "juno" and the little spears girl had a baby so it all seemed to coincide. <br>  <br>  in my kids school they brought in teen parents to speak to the students and that wiped out any desire for them(my children) to have kids before 30.|`|bkOn30I1aa	I never heard about them, but look for their questions, maybe they are still active, do you know the nicknames they were using for YA? If you do, just put it on the search bar and their questions will come up.

10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Breast milk is produced on demand. The flow would be minimal now because it was not needed. If you start feeding from the breast every 3-4 hours, even if not much comes out, you will stimulate the flow again. Or express as often as you can until it starts producing more. It could take a week or more to get enough milk to exclusively breast feed. Just make sure that the times you bottle feed him, that you still express, so that your body gets used to feeding at that time. Good on you for giving it another try, you are doing a good thing for your baby :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	try and get your baby ot latch on again- that is your best bet on gettng baby to latch-take a nursing vacation and lay in bed and nurse nurse nurse and eventually your supply will come back up to match baby's needs- the more you nurse the more you make. see a lactation consultant if you're having trouble with the latch- if that doesn't work out then pump every 2 hours. though pumping doesn't get as much milk out as baby so you may not have *** much milk and your supply might go back down again|`|qImMwhUHaa	Start the sucking action again by either latching baby on or pumping.|`|87e8184f643ec4cb00ae7615748f1da2aa	Fenugreek and Blessed thistle (both herbal supplements) are known to help increase milk, so do oats.  Breastmilk is a supply and demand thing. Nurse on demand, go no more than 2 hours without nursing, even at night.  If baby still seems hungry give a couple ounces of formula at the end of a nursing session, so that she doesn't get dehydrated.  Keep it up until your milk seems to satisfy her, and keep nursing frequently.  You will know you're making enough milk when baby is having 3-4 stools and 6-8 wet diapers daily.|`|irHF6CBPaa	Offer breast before each feeding he won't take out much but the sucking action will be good is it is also good so he will get use to the breast again and start pumping when baby is done pump for at least 15 min it is going to be harder this time around but keep at also if you could call the hospital where you had baby to speak to lactation consultant One last thing any thing you pump out feed to your baby even if it is a drop Good Luck.

2pxiK9waaa	It's very common for febrile seizures to happen to children. If your child has them, it's before the age of 5. If your child is older than 5 and has seizures, he/she will be tested for other seizure disorders.|`|BzH7l27oaa	It's unusual that you haven't heard of it either from a friend's or family member's child having one or when watching a medical show, maybe you just don't pay attention.|`|ENANtueuaa	Oh, i'm so sorry to hear that, i know i would have been have been scared to death!!

They say it's common in children under 5.  When my daughter was 5 she had a fit on the settee.  She was with my mum and dad and they panicked.  Got her an ambulance, she looked lifeless.  I wasn't there at the time but when I arrived my dad explained what had happened and raced straight to the hospital.  On my arrival she was lying on the bed in the hospital A & E, I saw her and burst into tears.  They explained to me about the rise in temperature called it a febrile convulsion.  They kept her in for observation and gave her calpol.  After a few hours she was fine,temperature down, but kept in just to be on the safe side.  Following day she was discharged.  My mum actually thought she was having an epileptic fit or something, she said mum and dad were very scared.  It's not happened to her since thank god so they are probably right in saying common under the age of 5.  Hope your daughter is fine now xxx|`|FkGh0LuWaa	I was not aware of it until the same thing happened to my son when he was 2.  Doctors need to make parents aware of this because it wouldn't have been so scary if I knew what was going on.

bcZSIphUaa	Maybe PCOS (most common cause of irregular periods in women)?|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	You need to go see a doctor.  Either you are pregnant or probably not ovulating properly.  Doctor will help you!  =)|`|YAwvszITaa	you may need a blood test for pregnancy. With my first child I kept taking urine tests and got negative till I was about 4 months pregnant so a blood test would be your best bet. Or you may just be irregular|`|abd8dd4fcfbbb00353f312ac986977fbaa	Go to a doctor.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Sometimes the hormone that is used to detect pregnancy is not strong enough in the urine to signal a positive on a HPT.    Make sure when you take the test it is the FIRST time you urinate that day. (right when you wake up) because that is when that hormone is the strongest.    If you still havent had one in a while go to the DR.    My sister took like 8 tests and they all came back negative. The  DR had to do a blood test to find out she was PG.      She took another HPT at 6 months pregnant just to see if it would work and it came back negative =/      some women just cant get the right result from a HPT.    Good luck!|`|VJpdmd0waa	You def could be pregnant or could just be really stressful from thinking your pregnant which can hold back your pd.  Set up a doc appointment they will def be able to help you better then we can.  Good Luck!|`|AA10939037	You might wait a week or so and try another test, sometimes you can have false negatives. If the test comes up negative again, I would go see your gyno and find out what's going on. Good luck!|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	You could be pregnant. It took my mom 4 1/2 months until she found out she was pregnant with me. Sometimes home pregnancy tests do not detect pregnancy for some reason. It sounds like you need to go to a doctor. He or she can give you a blood test for pregnancy, which is more accurate than urine test. Good luck!
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	So I dont understand if Im reading your question right you arent even sure if you were pregnant. You could be having a miscarriage if you were pregnant or you could just be having a heavy period so Im not sure. Go to the hospital though if you are worried.|`|vAYPTTZEaa	go to the doctor.. it could be but then again it could be a late heavy period. but if it is, then you might need a dnc.. better to be safe then sorry|`|rE9J1DqTaa	yes it might be|`|AchGld8Jaa	Go to a doctor!|`|VJpdmd0waa	You need to go to the Hospital right away.  They need to check you out to make sure you are ok..  GOOD LUCK!|`|mMByiHaQaa	Let me get this straight...you had unprotected sex and thought you wouldn't get pregnant?! Obviously you would have to expect it...|`|8YltlMsjaa	You might be, go to a dr..|`|SjdYj5Wdaa	It's very possible this is a miscarriage. How late is your period?  Having had two miscarriages, at this early stage there's really nothing your doctor could do.  If the bleeding gets heavier or stays the same, it probably is what's called a chemical pregnancy.  If it goes away, it might be some heavy breakthrough bleeding.  You can take a pg test tomorrow morning and know for sure.  I'm so sorry for you.  A miscarriage really sucks.

You have sit and lay out rules with him and what will happen from now on, if they are broken.   If he gets a allowance, set up a cuss jar.  Cost is 25 cents every time a cuss word is used. But seriously, talk with him and  not at him. Let him get the feeling you have about using it in your home. Tell him it might be OK at the far back of the school yard, but even then it degrades his intelligence and smartness. People that use this language, are usually not well educated and are dumb and that's all they really know. There is a rule in my home. We do not cuss and use bad language here and that includes my children's  friends, when in my house.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Put soap in his mouth, or ground him. But I think putting soap in his mouth will do the trick. and when he doesn't do it make him. show that YOUR the boss not him. and do it every single time he says a curse word. Have your husband help you if he won't open his mouth. Use soft soap, if won't hurt him but it will take FOREVER to get the taste out of his mouth lol. Oh and if he won't open his mouth just plug his nose b/c he'll have have to breath at one point. It sounds mean but he'll get your point ASAP|`|3gXQPso5aa	you punish him! your his mom and if punishment does not work you spank him!|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Punish him.  Take away privileges, the things he likes most, like TV or the computer.  If he says a curse word when you give him the punishment, double it.|`|pdzfq7ojaa	Punish him.  I'm 13 and got punished for swearing.  It taught me my lesson.  Tobasco sauce works too.  My mom did that once.  I wouldn't open my mouth, but a drop got on my skin and it BURNED!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Oh no! You need to pop him a good one. It is a very big deal and you better control him now or it will be impossible once he hits high school. My Mom would've had a belt on me so fast if I had done that (which is why I'd never even try her- not even today). Your son totally disrespect you to curse in front of you. Lets hope there aren't any younger kids in the house as well. He's seeing how far he can push you until he reaches your limit. He's trying to figure out how much exactly he can get away with and you need to show him.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Tell him that you don't care if he thinks it is a big deal. When he swears it reflects badly on you. His swearing is not open to debate.     My kids have been receptive to the don't make me look like a bad parent angle.     He won't think it is so cool when his 12 year old mouth is being soaped.|`|MOsStEbqaa	Well do you or anyone in your family cuss in front of him? I have a niece who live with me and my dad and my other sister and we do tend to cuss in front of her and i have caught her many times. That when i started to cuss as well. Does he get an allowance? Take that away or get a jar and every time he cusses he has to put a quarter in it so does the rest of the family. This is what we did and my niece is at least stopped cussing in front of us.|`|AA12374498	You have to discipline him.  here are some ideas = (http://kids.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Child_Di...    you have to keep letting him know that you don't like it.  Punish him, take his games away, etc etc..the least he can do is to respect you by not cussing in front of you.  Sorry and good luck!|`|9Igqrp2kaa	Do what my mom does.    Pull a belt out a wear his narrow butt out.    Do it everytime he say it. He'll learn.    I dont even like to curse behind my mom's back even if we are 50 miles apart out of fear that she'll hear me...lmao.|`|JdqDauEDaa	It's now become a habit. He's a little too old to smack for it-although it did work on me when I was 12. Putting him in his room probably will only give him more toys to play with and taking things away-the offense has nothing to do with the consequence.    Trying to ration with a 12 year old child is like trying to teach a pig to fly. Teenagers are not rational thinkers. They haven't developed that part of their brain yet. Did you read the newest US News article on teenage brains? Its very interesting and may give you some insight on your son.    Anyway, if it were my son, I wouldn't let him tell me it is no big deal and I certainly wouldn't try to reason with him. I would tell him very firmly that his behavior and language is UNACCEPTABLE and that he will NOT use that language again. I would tell him very firmly that I expect more from him and that I expect a well educated gentleman living in MY home.   Teach him to hold the door for you and for the women in your family. Old fashioned? Maybe. However, I guarantee if he is taught to respect women, those words will be a thing of the past. Monitor his friends. He chooses who spends time with. Teach him to spend time with people who respect HIM enough not to curse at him.   If he slips up on his language, he deposits 10% of his allowance or 10% of any money he makes into a "Cuss Jar". When the jar is full, treat yourself to a trip to the spa. Perhaps you can pretend to do that but in reality put it into an account for his college education. Your choice.  Good luck! I wish you the best.|`|AA11537580	try a swear jar  every time he swears he has to pay part of his allowance|`|iAFsKI9zaa	If you would have smacked him in the mouth the first time this wouldn't be happening!!! Honestly it's your fault he is so careless you have done nothing to stop it!|`|AA10475412	Well, you can try this even though it may not work, but the next time he uses that word, ground him, and take away his internet privileges etc. Hopefully he will catch on that cussing is not allowed.|`|1hsOl8Idaa	Kids learn by example.. so who cusses around him and get away with it? Is it you? His dad?     Fact is I see kids as young as 5 cussing and the parents yell at them and in the very next breath use 3 cuss words themselves.|`|5zSAPU52aa	ok so heres what you do mix up vineager salt pepper tobbaco sauce and soap pour in a cup and make him drink it every time he cusses if that doesnt work spank him.
XRzSxgUnaa	Try to keep her distracted. Play a lot of games with her. Hide n Seek because that will keep her busy.     Get her in a different room while her mom is leaving that way she doesnt see her mom leave.    If she gets upset, ask her what game she would like to play, if she gets to pick she might have more fun.|`|lzcglDnMaa	I work in a daycare and I see this thing everyday. The best thing I can tell you is let her hug her mom and dad as much as she wants too before they go. Then when they have to leave pull her away gently and have a toy ready to catch he attention. A game is not going to do that . Turn on a cute movie or cartoon that she likes. I usually have a toy ready for the child to play with, so when the parent has to go. I can grab the kid hug them and tell them everything is going to be ok and then get their attention on the toy. It works every time. Good luck to you and have fun.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Bring some toys from when you were a kid to play with with her. I'd also speak to mom ahead of time and see if it's possible for mom to sneak out. Or, bring her to the park or somewhere so that mom leaves while you're gone and you get back to the house and mom's just not there. Just a thought. She'll be fine after a few minutes. You can also have her make a card for her mom for Valentine's Day since it's coming up.|`|UxbjvAaRaa	Play with her.   Keep her attention and even when she realizes this tell  her that her mom will be back in no time and that it is okay.  Helpful? -kenzieee
1uAduUKhaa	From the time that I was 12 until I was 18, I babysat many boys and changed lots and lots of diapers.      I would say that Goodnites are diapers.  I suppose you can differentiate in a child is diapered by his mother or the woman that is caring for him.  Pull ups are worn by children that haven't matured but lets face it, incontinent attire is something that a woman requires her son to wear until he has matured.       Boys mature later than girls and it isn't unusual for a boy to require a bed time diaper until he is 10-13 years old.   Obviously an 11 year old wishes he didn't need to wear diapers.  But when he must wear a diaper, pull ups provide the boy wetness protection he needs and gives him a more 'grown-up or big boy' solution than having to be diapered by the woman caring for him.    One final thing:  A boy who wets himself and wears 'pull ups' or is diapered runs the risk of skin irritation and diaper rash.   This is particularly true in the cold winter months when the boy is bundled up  and wet diaper changes are less frequent.       If the boy is being allowed to wear pull ups, It is important that he is bathed regularly and that his mother or caregiver make sure that the boys diaper area is clean fresh and healthy.  I recommend appling baby oil to the boys diaper area each nite regardless of whether or not he wears pull ups or is diapered.      And if a rash develops, the best way to stop it is to squirt a large dollop of Desitin into your palm, mix it with a few drops of baby oil and then smooth the mixture over the effected area.  It will sooth boys sensitive skin, make him more comfortable and it should clear up in a jiffy :)|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Not at all.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	No. I so wish I had them when I was a kid. I was teased to no end by my siblings, even the younger ones because I was 8 when I stopped peeing in bed and having accidents. I had been to the doctor & urologist, and it was not my fault that I couldn't hold it.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	No!  Some kids take longer to learn how to wake up when they need to go to the bathroom in the night.  They are not diapers.    My son wet the bed until he was 10 and a half and often wore dry nites to protect the bed.|`|AA11284434	No.  Some kids really don't wake up.  I just got one of my kids out of them and I basically wake him at 4am to go.  If I don't wake him, there is an accident in the morning and he will sleep through it.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	No. Diapers and goodnight underpants are different.     Diapers are used by babies/toddlers every day 24/7. They are not fully potty trained.    Goodnight underpants are used by kids who are potty trained but they have the occasional accidents in the nights.|`|zrhrJQvtaa	No they aren't diapers they are night time underwear. That's what I tell my 8 year old son.|`|Xngq54vBaa	Yes, just like Depends or other adult incontinence products are considered adult diapers.  They are useful if the toddler is able to go to the potty most of the time and wants to be in practice pulling up and down underwear to go like a "big kid" but if they're just being used for kids to not have to get out of bed to go potty (like a diaper) then that's what they really are.  It's just a little better on young egos.  We call my son's pullups his "night time underwear."|`|5i8rtlmXaa	to kids yes, to adults no.
AA11100991	There are studies that show that learning takes place before birth. Watch your baby. See how he or she intently watches everything. A baby that small will even mimic mouth movements of the parent. Although he or she is very small, not much is missed. He/she is in hyper-learning mode understanding far more than you think and working hard to accomplish what he/she observes. Consider how long it takes for the child to smile, roll over, sit up, walk---all within a year or so. That takes incredible intelligence and determination.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i suggest u buy a book called 'what to expect the first year' and read it; it has  a lot of great info and it is a good reference after u have read it initiallly....it tells you all this stuff through a year of age...|`|zwctZ812aa	My son is 3 months old and definitely recognizes me.  He knows my voice and gets a big smile on his face when he sees me.  He has always been very alert, and although I'm not entirely sure how far he can see, he stares at the tv and looks at me from across the living room when daddy is holding him.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	the mama, the boob and milk.|`|aI3WsnnEaa	They are afraid of heights studies show.. they also know right from wrong and have minor cognitive abilities (can tell a dime is worth more than a nickel etc etc)|`|fc1a879190d20993471e9ab52be8c605aa	My baby turns three months on Feb 9 and he recognizes me and his daddy. He tries to imitate us when we eat. He makes talking sounds. He startles more than when he was a newborn. He calms down when you start changing his diaper. He needs more that just food and sleep like he did at first. He has become much more vocal and knows how to cry differently to get different things. I don't know how far he can see, but he responds to stimulus eight feet away. He tries to make his toys work by copying the way we make them go. And sometimes he wants mom or dad specifically. He smiles and loves to have his cheeks and chin played with. And he tries to stay awake even though he is tired. He never did that as an newborn.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	My second child slept until she was nearly 4 months old.  I would say they are pretty much aware of food and their mother's warmth.|`|e04c51f2b749e33c0c4702b878edacbdaa	That their smile will melt your heart!

We've been trying for about 5 months with no luck.  I've been having irregular bleeding, spotting, etc. . . without being pregnant.  So, it's probably down to your menstrual cycles taking a different lane.|`|cRURImjhaa	I too have a daughter and have been ttc for the past 11 months.  AF is due to come on the 5th so I of course am getting my hopes up with each hour that goes by.  I have a very regular cycle and always have.  i spoke to my Doc about it about 5 months ago and due to my age, 30, he did not seem concerned and said to check back after a year of ttc.  i too don't know what to think.|`|70kh6VSoaa	it took me a year to get pregnant with both my children a year exactly just about its normal for it not to happen right away when you stop trying so hard that's when it usually happens
yaWCDYN9aa	I also had period like cramps, but no period.  I was exhausted ALL the time, all I ever wanted to do was sleep.  I developed this gag reflex (one of my first signs)  I was also nauseated all the time.  My breast HURT SOOO bad.  The emotional thing didn't hit me until later.  My stomach, well, uterous, was HARD, like a rock!  My body stared to ache.  I felt like I had just finished a triathalon.  These were all signs and symptoms for me.  I'm leaning towards, yes.|`|ALoxtdH0aa	Those are all symptoms of pregnancy but you could be having cramps because your period is on the way. Take a hpt. Hope you get a bfp.

Z0I5Qvk7aa	Bloody stools are never normal, however, it's not usually serious. It's very possible that you have hemorrhoids or a fissure. Does it hurt, or sting when you go to the bathroom? Another good question is, what color is the blood? If it's bright red, it means it's new blood, and usually nothing to be concerned about. However, if it's dark (black), then it's coming from higher up in the tract and could be serious. <br>  <br>  Either way, I would definitely bring it up at your next doctor's appointment. If it's dark, though, I would think about going to the hospital, or clinic as soon as you possibly can, as this could indicate a serious problem.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Bloody stools are never good and no, it not normal.  It could be anything from a small graze from wiping too much to colon cancer.  Go to the doctor immediately because you could be at risk of internal bleeding.|`|EyKJ737daa	No sweetie, it's not normal, you should go to the hospital and seek medical assistance.

You need to go to the ER asap and get checked. Make sure you place a pad on now and when you get there they can see how much you have bled from the time you left you house. They are going to want to know when it started and for how long. Are you having pain and etc? Good luck dear....i will say a prayer for you and your baby!!|`|5ItOGyVHaa	that is not normal, you need to go to the hospital. i am sure baby is fine. but there might be something else wrong. if you do not want to go, then call and explain to the nurse on duty what is going on. i am sure she will tell you to come in.|`|GJHT1KOaaa	Have you been constipated?

5ItOGyVHaa	your baby can hear you. it can hear your voice and knows when you are yelling or when you are speaking softly. that happens very early. 1st trimester. maybe 2-3 months. <br>  <br>  i know by the 7th month my baby could hear my husband. every night he would scooch down in the bed and get right next to my belly and talk to the baby. a mother knows and i just knew my son was listening to his daddy.

w6KRRJOsaa	I like the moby wrap..its very comfrotable and can carry the baby in many ways..|`|83nHy2PXaa	"Ergo" is the best in my opinion. It may not be the best for the newborn (there is a special insert for newborns), but your baby is old enough for it. It might be on the expensive side (105$ for the basic version), but it's completely worth the money, considering its durability and level of comfort.<br>  We got the baby bjorn at first. Our chubby son outgrew it very fast, maybe at about 4-5 months. My back couldn't stand it anymore and we went for the "Ergo".<br>  The main advantage of it is the ergonomical design which makes it very comfortable for the parent - the weight is carried on the hip (in baby bjorn the weight is on the lower back) and this way you can carry even 3-4-old kids, it's up to 60 lb. It's comfortable to use once your baby can hold his head and continues to be comfortable when the baby is quite heavy. You can wear the baby in the frond, on the side or on the back.<br>  We used it from about 3-4 months untill now (the baby is 12 months, around 30 lb). <br>  we bough it from <a href="http://www.myfavoritebabycarrier.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myfavoritebabycarrier.com/</a><br>  It offers 90-days money back EVEN if you used the carrier and didn't like it. You can also find the presentation about the carrier there just to watch.<br>  Good luck!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I use a sling and a pouch baby carrier. Both I made myself for under $15. (google how to make them, there are a ton of resources). The pouch was is to make and free since I used an old sheet (it's the prettiest shade of blue) and the ring sling I went to buy fabric for 4 yds and some rings off of ebay (if you want to make your own you cannot use craft rings). I use both equally. I've been using the slings I made since she was born, she's now 2 1/2 months old, she fusses a little about getting man handled into it sometimes but she loves it when she in. I use it a lot when she is fussy and gassy, it puts her to sleep every time, I also wear it/her on my back when making dinner so I don't have to keep going back to her.
5ZvALiclaa	there are some things i am using for the third time!  <br>  <br>  of course she should reuse stuff, her sister is obviously spoiled and has too much money. Why on earth would you buy new stuff? If it were broken to the point of not being safe then fair enough you would replace it but if its still good, keep on using it! Even car seats can be reused as long as its still safe|`|AA11109728	I don't know anyone who wouldn't reuse big baby items such as the car seat, bath tub, swing, etc.  Especially since they are still very new.  I purposely got all my basic baby items in basic neutral colors so I could reuse them in the future if I have more kids, no matter what gender they may be.  I thought it was very smart.  If her sister thinks she should have all new things, then the sister should be the one to go out and buy them!|`|cG80UU5Waa	She should definitely reuse her stuff...I mean it's all less than a year old! Also, no offense to your friend or her sister, no bank is going to give a low income person a personal loan right now. Unless something is broken and is a safety hazard it's more than fine to reuse baby stuff. I have quite a few hand me downs from friends/family--nothing wrong with it at all.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	You're not wrong.  If everything was in working condition I'd be using it rather than buying new stuff.|`|DVX8UVKOaa	It is ridulous to get new things. Most things get grown out of so quickly such as crib/moses basket, swing etc that they don't get enough wear to need replacing for a second child. A car seat, cot and pram etc should be well made enough to last through several childhoods.<br>  A newborn baby has no opinion on whether they should have new or second hand things. They just need their basic needs catered for so they are safe, well fed and clean. Also as the child gets older they will get spoiled and expect brand new things all the time.|`|c73QkZ2haa	She should definitely reuse it all. But she needs to check the car seat and make sure its not expired. Beleive it or not theirs an expiry date on there. <br>  I cant imagine why her sister said that if she knows the financial situation of your neighbour. She obviously doesnt have much financial sense. And god if i was hard up i would be looking for used stuff way before i felt it necessary to take out a loan.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	No you are not wrong at all! regardless of her income, it would be a waste to go and buy all this stuff again.  I have three kids, and am pregnant again, they all have used handmedowns from their elder sisters or from family and friends.  The only exception is car seats, they can be rendered useless even by dropping them so I wouldn't use one from someone else, but I have reused mine.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend that the last thing she needs right now is to be getting into debt.<br>  <br>  Claire|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I got a bunch of that stuff from my sister to reuse for my baby so unless they are damaged in any way it should be just fine for her to reuse items. Baby stuff is expensive and her sister should give her the $ if she thinks the baby needs new stuff.|`|5iv8axUsaa	No, you are not wrong, definitely go with reusing them!<br>  There are no health risks, as long as you buy new bottles, nappies, etc, but thats just common sense. <br>  Definitely reuse, even if she had a high income, you gotta save money!|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	all things are fine to reuse if the car seat and bath tub are still safe and are in good condition theres no reason to have to new ones|`|DsT3kOdBaa	theres nothing wrong with reusing stuff like that...as long as everything is washed down|`|NRItz2OSaa	Reuse it all!!|`|i7QJAgquaa	its totally okay to reuse i have two daughters one is 4 and the other 2<br>  the oldest passed on clothes,shoes,stroller,bathtub...etc<br>  just make sure there well dusted off washer tub with soap and water before baby uses it.the baby will be fine the only thing is that if the car seat has been an any type of car accident i should be replaced<br>  the only thing stopping you is if the baby is different gender|`|hPgDNG2haa	of course she should use her old things as long as they are not broken.as long as the car seat hasnt been in a car crash that should be fine too.i will be using some of my old things and mine are alot older than your friends.<br>  it would be silly to spend money on something just to  keep up appearances.|`|9Ij8t72eaa	Of course she should re-use the baby stuff...<br>  <br>  She will have more money for wine and chocolate when the kids are stressing her out.<br>  <br>  The baby will get an early start on green issues (although they are generally already full of green snot)|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Of course she should reuse it! For goodness sake, why wouldn't you reuse a bathtub? Mine did five kids - two of mine and three of my sister-in-law's, and it's up in the loft now in case anyone else in the family needs it.<br>  <br>  She should take a close look at the car seat, though. If it's had heavy use, or been left in the sun a lot, or if it looks at all worn or damaged, she should get a new one. And she should definitely get a new cot mattress. Apart from that? I don't think I bought anything new at all for my second baby. New cot mattress, new pram mattress, that was it.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Car seats are about the only thing that shouldn't be reused, but not in this case.  If they're older than 5-7 years, have been in an accident (and since she's always owned it she would know), or have been recalled (again, she should know that) then you get a new one.  But... otherwise you can use the one you had before for the new baby.   And with her 11 month old almost a year old, she probably could get a forward facing (20lbs+) carseat/booster for the older baby and use the baby seat for the new baby.  <br>  <br>  Everything else... shoot.  Just make sure she's aware of recalls and it's all good.  :P  I mean, I used a 10 year old swing with my daughter.  She didn't notice it was old.  She slept just as well in it.
tMgZh8hPaa	Babies need omega-3's to build their brains.  A tablespoon of flax oil, per day should help out your baby.  I know this seems like a lot, but just hold out the spoon, and allow him to get some, he'll let you know if he needs it.  A couple weeks after introducing flax oil to my 11mo baby, she was finally able to ride in the car seat- for more than two minutes- without crying bloody murder.  After more years of nutritional research, I also believe that most babies in industrialized countries are born deficient in vit D.  Get some daily sunshine on that baby, again to optimize brain growth.  High quality cod-liver-oil would provide both omega-3's and vitamin D.  Most babies are fine with the taste, it's fat, they need it and like it.  Try it, it's been in use for hundreds of years, and is a lot safer than Cylert or ritalin.  Good luck, you're not crazy, and take some flax oil yourself, your reserves have got to be depleted after 6 babies.|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	just because you can give birth to 6 kids, it doesn't mean you are void of any parental faults.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Every thing you just stated is a sign of ADHD,I would talk with a doctor about it as soon as possible.

It has to do with feeling safe if no one else is in the house. If there is another guy in the house and she still says she can't sleep  then it is probably an excuse to have you home at night cuz parents like to pull that BS. If no one is in the house then it is most likely cuz she doesn't feel safe. So maybe if someone she trusts sleeps over when your not home.  maybe she could have a tazer gun next to her when she sleeps.|`|aFHerABDaa	Ahw, so you obviously know she loves ou, to the point where it's getting annoying.

It just looks like you couldn't figure out how to spell it and made it up.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Tiana Emersyn is beautiful! A nice name to go with them would be Imogen (Immi).

I'm curious why you are pronouncing the first name with an "R" in there - why not add it if you want it in there so your poor little girl isn't constantly correcting people on the pronunciation?  Just curious....<br>  EDIT:  Nothing about your chosen names is traditional! lol!  Until I read your pronunciation, I thought it was Tiani (Tee-Ah-Nee) which I think sounds better.  Then again, it's not my kid...I'm just answering a question that was asked... lol!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Tiani is pronounced TI_AH_NEE not tee-YAR-nee. <br>  I don't like the middle names. Emerson is a boy's name and Briemma is made up and sounds like you are trying to say Brianna whilst intoxicated. Why not just use Brianna? Or if you want something more orginial, Briannon?
UbCzA2JVaa	Well as you know, I love Imogen Briemma. The nickname Immi is just gorgeous as well!<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Imogen is a popular name in Australia and England. It's not a name that I particularly like though.<br>  Emersyn is just Emerson misspelt. I love the name Emerson but only for a boy. It is a common boy's name.<br>  Tiani is a variation of tiana. But it's pronounced ti-ah-na. So Tiani should be pronounced Ti-ah-nee.

Emersyn is just a trashy spelling in a bid to make the name more feminine. Emerson will never be feminine, girly or unisex. It ends in SON.<br>  <br>  Imogen is beautiful.<br>  Briemma isn't a name.|`|NHWuPaTpaa	You can't spell it Tiani, then pronounce it Tiarni (Tee-yar-nee) like you have.  Imogen sounds like you're mispronouncing Imagine.  Briemma makes me think you're about to say Pre-eminent danger, but you just stop..like Briemma-nent danger. Just combine Emersyn with Imogen and make the middle initial C, so you get Emergen C.|`|57LFRfqCaa	Imogen Something|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	TIANI|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Neither.|`|3fcfd4d7bc4f0ec25226893409bc8af5aa	Tiani.

5PqD4k3Raa	PCOS  complications with miscarriages is usually only when you have had a miscarriage before because it offsets your insulin levels and everything else being affected by the whacky hormone level. Also think of it this way, if it causes hormones to go whacky and what not itll will cause weight loss/or weight gain- and when that becomes excessive on either end your pregnancy will be at risk. <br>  <br>  Just stay helathy make sure your a healthy way and recieving proper nutrtion- supplements may help.

If your still stressing call your midwife or ob and discuss with them. God bless you and your pregnancy.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I have PCOS and have a very healthy normal pregnancy. I would clarify with your OB if you have PCOS or just cysts on your ovaries due to pregnancy. I know that the cysts on my ovary got worse when i got pregnant.

jBdvUQEXaa	In an average 28 day cycle, a woman is fertile for about two days. Sperm generally survive inside of the woman's body for about 48 hours. They CAN live up to 5 days, but very few make it that long, and the odds of pregnancy from those few remaining sperm are virtually nil, so we'll use the 48 hour life-span as our estimate, since it's more reasonable. Now, this gives the average woman about a three day window period every month for pregnancy to occur. From this alone, the odds of getting pregnant from a one-time sexual encounter are about 11%. <br>  <br>  Now, it's estimated that pregnancy only occurs about 1/4 to 1/2 of the time that sperm and the egg are present together, due to a variety of reasons. This lowers the odds of pregnancy from a single sexual encounter to about 3-5%. <br>  <br>  However, if you don't want to get pregnant, either don't have sex, or use reliable contraception<br>  <br>  Hope all works out well<br>  <br>  Claire|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	LOL - I always refer to the withdrawal method as a fertility tool.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? Personally, I would tell him, cause like you said, he has a right to know. I would make it clear though that I didn't want him to be there if he was going to be resentful. If he didn't want to be there, he didn't have to be. ?¤·?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Tell him just so he knows, but only if you feel you'll be safe from him - just as long as him being "angry and upset" doesn't involve him coming after you. I think he has the right to know and it may make it easier for stuff down the track. You should definitely seek child support, other than that leave th rest up to him if he wants to be involved or not, probably not, and if that's what he's like then that's probably best for the child, not seeing him. I know it would be tough if the father resented the child but I think you should take that risk, the child might resent you more if you didn't let him know.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|rKJQIaCdaa	I would tell him and make sure to file for child support.  This guy doesn't need to get a pass just because he thinks he has the god given right to procreate.   This child didn't ask to be made,  two people were irresponsible.  Unless the man is true garbage (as in criminal),  go for child support, and maybe this guy will eventually use his head for more than a hat rack and become a dad.   As long as women keep giving guys passes, the same bums will keep having more children.  Your child will be ok as long as you are a great mom and don't run lots of guys through his life and give him security.|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	whether he wants a child or not he has to know. if he chooses not to be in his/her life thats his own stupidity. you shouldnt care what matters to him. and you never know maybe before you give birth or soon after he'll have a change of heart. but again you hav to tell him. good luck and stay strong!!!!|`|3lV7ZY3raa	well when my mum got pregnant she decided not tell my father and 15 years later, id say i had a very healthy childhood, since i didnt have to grow up between two homes.|`|7CXVSa23aa	just at least tell him. he should know. it's not your fault anymore if your ex isn't man enough to be a father to your baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  -gg-|`|hYZIYla0aa	Are you capable of supporting this child on your own? He is liable for the care of your baby.He needs to be responsible for this child as well as any other child he helped conceive.He wants to have sex with women,yet when there are two of you pregnant he does not want to take responsibility.He sounds like a jerk to me,but that is just my opinion.I did not mean to hurt your feelings,but you need to make him be responsible for this baby.You did not do this alone.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Yea.. the great part.. Well my advice is you need to tell him. He has the right to know. After that let it be. I have a son who's father told me to get an abortion when he found out I was pregnant.  It hurt and it pissed me off to no end. But what can you do? You can't force someone to be involved physically.. Now financially that's another story! LOL! And your baby doesn't have to see the father. My son hasn't seen his father in about 3 months because he's mad at me.  Because of a number of reasons, and they're all just as stupid as the next. You don't resent your baby and that's all that matters.  Love that baby to no end. And if the father resents his baby oh well.. Your a strong woman and can do this! Just be the best mom ever!!|`|AA11566371	Tell him, make sure he knows he'll be paying child support and maybe this time he'll remember to use protection when he doesn't want children.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	I would say tell him for a few reasons. The first is that he is a grown man and he should be able and willing to take responsibility for not using protection while he is sexually active. Angry and upset he may be but too bad so sad. He should have thought of that before he was sexually active. Another reason is that your child may want to know him and it may be easier for the child to make contact in the future if it doesn't have to 'prove' to him that he is the father. And it just isn't your decision to make for the child. Everyone is entitled to know where they came from. Your ex may improve with age and want to see the child in a few years. He should definitely be required to contribute financially for his child. That is not your call either...it is the child's money not yours. He does have the right to know also. He may not like it but that is not your decision either...if he does he does if not then its his loss. Keeping things from people never works out in the long run. It always comes out and it just complicates things. He sounds very immature but then we all were once upon a time and we all deserve the chance to grow up and become responsible. He may or may not but tell him and then when your child asks you will be able to look them in the eye and truthfully tell them that their father knew about them from the beginning. Good luck with the baby.

You would have to be extremely obese to not notice the weight gain,belly popping and the baby movements are not easily mistaken for other things.

A urine test could be neg the whole time but a blood hcg would show the hormone for sure.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	yes it has happened before. there are a few shows on tlc i think that i saw  that a few women were pregnant and they had negative test but 9 months later they get sharp pains and rush to the ER only to find out that they were really pregnant|`|0VHolTVEaa	Never been through it but its highly unlikely as the first scan will tell your pregnant. However i have read stories about women who have their periods and didnt know they were pregnant until they went into labour, its quite stange really. Doctors these days should be able to tell if your having a baby though|`|nPa5QFOeaa	it could be a phantom pregnancy
VhCw4Pvyaa	honestly... i hate it when people tell me to get a test when i just want advise too, but hmmm... it could be that you are. Is your period a little lighter? You could be pregnant. Well anyone that has sex can be, but those symptoms are the lovely symptoms of pregnancy. So here's my advice, wait for more people to answer you back, think about their advice, and then figure out what you should do from there.<br>  good luck and hope the outcome is as you want it to be<br>  <br>  :):):)|`|NkGTSqBdaa	Well it sounds to me like your are not pregnant but as you said it is rare to get your period and still be pregnant. To be honest I think that your best option is to go to your doctor and get a blood test done because it is the best way to indicate if you are pregnant or not. Your doctor can also advice you about what else might be going on if you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck xx|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I doubt it if your period was 6 days and heavy. Food cravings or changes in appetite can come any time really, just randomly, or maybe it's the start of a stomach bug or other illness, or maybe you're deficient in something.<br>  <br>  Women can bleed while pregnant as you know, but it's not a real period (that would flush the whole uterine lining so it's impossible).<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|jBdvUQEXaa	1 I had a "period" at the start of my last pregnancy, it was probably implatation bleeding - it was lighter than a normal period.  Also a period when pregnant could mean a tubal or ectopic pregnancy something that should be checked out.<br>  <br>  2 You can crave foods that your body is lacking at anytime.  For example salty/spicy/creamy foods could all mean you are dehydrated and lacking in electolytes or essential vitamins and minerals<br>  <br>  3 If you want to get pregnant - do it properly, take a look at your diet, take supplements, especially folic acid. If you now realise you dont want to get pregnant just yet, then make sure you dont.<br>  <br>  To be honest, the best thing you could do is wait till the first day of your next period and test.<br>  <br>  Good luck

From now on, seenig how things affect her, I would shield her from any further bad news such as this, she doesnt need to know this type of stuff at such a young age. Anyhow, no I have not been in this situtation or near it, I do know that oftern we need professional intervention asap to help the healing process to begin and ease the pain.
cJQL64ylaa	There are sadly loads of reasons!  Blocked tubes is obviously one, but there are others such as a low sperm count (not enough sperm), poor sperm motility (they don't swim right), bad sperm morphology (they are the wrong shape), premature ovarian failure (basically an early menopause), hard egg shells so the sperm just can't break through the egg and if it does the embryo can't "hatch", poor quality eggs, endometriosis, hormone imbalances, poor womb lining, chromasomal abnormalities with eggs or sperm, PCOS, lots and lots of reasons...  <br>  <br>  And there are also a huge number of people who never understand the reasons for their infertility and end up falling into the category who are termed "unexplained" which makes trying to solve the problem with the appropriate fertility treatment very difficult.<br>  <br>  I should add that not all of the conditions above will result in IVF treatment, but you did say treatment "such as" so I have included a number of conditions that are frequently treated with other types of fertility treatment.<br>  <br>  We ended up achieving our dream of a family after IVF treatment with donor eggs and donor sperm due to a combination of premature ovarian failure, poor sperm count and quality, poor egg quality, hormone imbalances and potential chromasomal abnormalities, so unfortunately we ticked quite a few of the boxes.  But we got there eventually (it took us 6 years!) and now have beautiful 5 month old twin girls asleep in the nursery upstairs to show for it...  So however bad the problems seem, there are often treatments that can offer hope to people going through the heartbreak of infertility.<br>  <br>  If you want to find out more about the various reasons for infertility you could contact organisations such as infertility network UK (www.infertilitynetworkuk.com), or fertility friends (www.fertilityfriends.co.uk)<br>  <br>  Nic x|`|U3qTwOOIaa	could be a problem with the sperm, or just cannot for whatever reason

jBdvUQEXaa	That very much depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  1. If it's a case of a condom not working or something then the girl can go get the morning after pill up to 72 hrs after sex.  This prevents the fertilised egg from implanting by fooling the body into thinking it is pregnant already.<br>  <br>  2. If the girl finds out that she is pregnant then there are two main methods of abortion. Medical abortion involves taking a combination of drugs, and surgical abortion involves a minor operation. Most abortions can be provided on a day care basis, which means you do not need to stay at a clinic overnight.<br>  <br>  If the girl decides that abortion is the way ahead, she should get counselling,it's a huge decision, and one she has to live with for the rest of her life.  There are other options, adoption being one.  Explore them all before you make any firm decisions.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Claire|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	no they have to go in through the vaginal area. and KILL IT !!! if u  know someone whos thinking about it talk them into adoption.<br>  <a href="http://abortionno.org/Resources/pictures_3.html" rel="nofollow">http://abortionno.org/Resources/pictures...</a><br>  look at these pics|`|AA11952083	abortion is a capital sin. i suggest not to pursue the plan. every life is a gift. goodluck!|`|5CBOYaMHaa	Yes !

AA11254601	having an abortion is actually rather painful, on both mother and child.  IF you hook up a monitor, you will actually hear your baby scream in pain when they perform the abotion.<br>  <br>  Sometiemse they take a utinsil and literally pull the baby's arms and legs off its body to kill it, then pull it out of you in pieces.<br>  <br>  Other times, you take a series of drugs that are designed to kill the baby, but they make you sick as a dog.<br>  <br>  And then there are the partial birth abortions.  those are not doen as often, you go through the birth proces, and before the babies head comes out, the doctor sticks a sharp utensil in the child's brian to kill him or her.<br>  <br>  I think that's all of them.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	it all depends on how far along you are, if its the pill it has to be taken within 72 hours of conception, you cant get one after 8 weeks where i live but the two ways they do an abortion are they will either use a vaccumm type machine to suck it out or they will do some sort of shot into the uterus.<br>  <br>  Talina: your response probably got deleted due to it not being helpful to the question, i dont agree with it either but i still gave the information i knew.|`|xImYfDzraa	i took a friend to an abortion clinic it took like ten minutes this was 12 years ago i now regret it and it wasn't even mine .|`|2KQ33q1haa	An early medical abortion is one that takes place in the first trimester, usually between 5-7 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  you will be given a drug called Mifegyne. This makes the lining of the womb unsuitable for the pregnancy to continue. This drug can make some women feel sick. If vomiting occurs, a second pill has to be given. After this, you can go home.<br>  <br>  During the next 48 hours, you may start to bleed and experience stomach cramps. Some women expel the pregnancy at home.You will be expected to go back to the clinic or hospital at a pre-arranged time and four tablets will be placed in your vagina. The drug (called prostaglandin) causes the womb to contract and expel the foetus. You will be given painkillers for stomach cramps. Most women expel the foetus within 1-6 hours whilst at the clinic or hospital.<br>  <br>  Late medical abortions are those that take place after 12-14 weeks of pregnancy. Some clinics and hospitals now prefer a medical termination as an alternative to surgical abortion if you are over 14 weeks of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  The upper limit for this procedure varies across England and Wales so you will need to ask for local information from your nearest pregnancy crisis centre, GP or family planning clinic.<br>  <br>  Late medical abortions up to 16/17 weeks use the same medication as an early medical abortion, but will probably involve taking prostaglandin vaginally and by mouth. Stomach cramps can be quite strong, but again you will be given painkillers. <br>  <br>  After 16/17 weeks, the uterus may also injected with prostaglandin to induce contractions and a substance to ensure that the foetus is not delivered alive.<br>  <br>  Surgical abortion can be offered as an alternative to a medical abortion, but in some places it is not now the preferred method. Local information about procedures needs to be sought from your nearest pregnancy crisis centre, GP or family planning clinic.<br>  <br>  Early Surgical Abortion<br>  <br>  How is an early surgical abortion done?<br>  <br>  Up to 14 weeks of pregnancy, a suction method (called vacuum aspiration) can be used. The woman is usually given a general (but sometimes a local) anaesthetic. A suction tube is inserted into the womb and the developing baby (foetus) is removed. After this, a woman usually bleeds for up to 14 days.<br>  <br>  <br>  Late surgical abortio<br>  <br>  Up to 19 weeks of pregnancy, the developing baby is larger so surgical dilatation and evacuation (D&E) is used. This means that, under general anaesthetic, the opening of the woman's womb is stretched open and forceps (a metal tool) are used to remove the developing baby. Again, bleeding may occur afterwards for up to 14 days.<br>  <br>  After 20 weeks of pregnancy, surgical abortion involves injecting the developing baby to stop its heart or cutting the umbilical cord to ensure that it is dead. The next day, a dilatation and evacuation procedure (D&E, as described above) is done to remove it from the womb. The woman is under general anaesthetic for both parts of this abortion and usually has to stay in for at least one night.<br>  <br>  Personally i disagree with miscarriage.. but thats me.. everyone to their on i spose.. .x|`|XTf9VaLoaa	u take 1 pill then go away then she will hav to go bk the next day then take another after she will have mild tummy ache and bleeding. u cann only take a pill if its early on in the preg. think carefully once its done its done x
eXsR8Gx5aa	I have to agree with another answerer, it is rather odd to put an amount on it since in reality we are designed to be breastfed & there is therefore no way of knowing how much milk a baby will take, all of these things are based on formula fed babies (weight charts, amounts of milk etc) It also doesn't take into account individual differences. I remember having an argument with Mr Berry not so long ago - he was of the opinion I was starving the baby because he thought there was "no way" he was getting enough milk from breastfeeding. In Mr Berry's mind the baby should have been taking at least 8oz per feed  - because of his age apparently - haha! Even when fed from a bottle he'll usually take 6oz as an absolute max.<br>  <br>  I don't think it changes though between 6-9 & 9-12 because even with a good healthy varied & balanced diet milk is still a very important part of that. Of couse, when you factor in the babies are often also getting fat, calories, calcium etc from cheese & yoghurts (my son loves things like this!) then maybe its not so important - the Baby Berry won't drink any other fluids though so I do still intend to breastfeed him as often as ever (he is always offered water but will only drink it out of his bath! lol)|`|irP2yTMWaa	I think about the 16-20oz but not all milk yogurt and other dairy.I had a word with my HV and i can give him 3 bottle a day i'm dropping it to that today 10 am bottle my lo will be getting 18oz from the bottle and formula on breakie making it 20oz but they did tell me 16oz or even 14oz can be fine ie 2 bottle a day if having a good diet including dairy.I got told to drop to am and pm bottle at 12 month and change to full fat milk. Don't worry to much my niece and daughter would only take about 12oz at that age but had yogurt etc to make it up xx<br>  <br>  If they have a good diet don't worry like the lady above milk now part of a mixed diet not the main part x<br>  <br>  Forgive my wording a few key are not working lol !!!|`|baI5G8yLaa	Ohhh NO i must be feeding my baby wayyyy to much then LOL<br>  <br>  he has 5 bottles of 7oz of milk a day! thats 35oz!!<br>  <br>  But he dosent way a massive amount he is hardly gaining any weight i fact he has dropped on his chart!<br>  <br>  but i did find this....<br>  Once your baby reaches six months, you can feed him anywhere from 180-220 ml / 6-8oz at a feeding, and his total formula intake should be roughly 900ml / 32oz per day. <br>  Once you start adding solids to his diet, his daily intake of formula milk should gradually decrease to about 720ml / 24oz. The Food Standards Agency recommends that once your baby is established on solids, he should be having approximately 600ml / 20oz or one pint of formula milk per day alongside a varied diet until he is a year old. After the age of one, he can move from drinking formula milk to full-fat cow's milk. <br>  <br>  I think HV's are given mixed advice sometime's! my told me off the other day and said i should be feeding him from a proper cup! NO not beaker a acyual cup  that we drink from?? jesus he is 7 months not 7!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  really just go with what your baby needs you are the best judge|`|4YIUxSlYaa	My 9 month old is having between 40-60oz in 24 hours.  <br>  <br>  She is 'supposed' to have 21oz.

I have a question about weight for age ratios which I couldn't find on UK sites<br>  <br>  Cow and Gate  say between 3 beakers of 7oz a day to 2 beakers of 8.3 oz (although how you measure .3 of an oz in a hurry is beyond me.)<br>  <br>  We old wives used to just give them a bottle/breast after breakfast and at bed time.

uAyYRXnvaa	Byron Bay would be a good place.  There's a wide variety of accomodation from camping to luxury apartments, the beach, the shops, the Thursday Plantation has a rainforest sculpture walk the kids love, the Crystal Palace isn't too far and most importantly.... the Railway Bar.  We stop there all the time passing through and there's live music every night, plus loads of local kids running around.  My girls have an awesome time with the other kids and it gives you a chance to relax as well.. the people are always really friendly.<br>  <br>  Caloundra's pretty good as well.  There's Shelly Beach with lots of rockpools your boy will love.  There's lots of stuff along the boardwalk.. parks, fountains, big bright sculptures.  You can also go to Australia Zoo, Mary Cairncross Park up towards Maleny which has a great rainforest walk, there's a waterfall (can't remember the name) you can swim at.  There's pretty good markets.  A lot of the pubs in that area have playgrounds and the RSL has a supervised creche.<br>  <br>  There's lots of great places along the coast - we normally stay in tents or cabins and the kids always take less than 10 minutes to make loads of friends.  It's a more social environment than staying in a hotel, especially if you're on your own.  Good luck with it!|`|vI0WnAiOaa	hi i just came back from a short break on the gold coast and stayed at a place called paradise resort. its a real family friendly hotel with a kids club. if you book the resort room for a 4 year old you should get two free sessions in there for your child and you can go relax by the pool or slip out and shop or whatever for 3 hours. i will include a link for you. the resort rooms cost about 110 per night. i went with a 2yr old and spent a day at seaworld too, that is the berst one of the worlds as the kids can be a bit small for most of the attractions at the others - at least at  seaworld there is all the animals and fishies to look at and your boy will love the sharks too.|`|xGI9z01Maa	It's your vacation so go were you will be happy to be.  At 4 years old he will not remember later.  Once you choose a place.  Call the local hotels and ask them if they have a sitter, if you want some time to yourself.  At one time, most good hotels had them.  Then look at the cities vacation information for children.  Most places will have all kinds of different things children.  <br>  <br>  I live in Hawaii.  We did the local Zoo, beach, children's center, Dole (which has a train), and everything else when we first got here.<br>  <br>  Most important he will be happy just to be with you.  The below is the Hawaii's Official Tourism Site (not that you want to do Hawaii) but most places will have a site like this one which will give you a list of children's items for their area.<br>  <br>  One tip: Look for a place that you can take your own car.  It is so much easier to have everything you need in the car and be able to take everything that you want with you.  And cheaper.  Plus it is hard to deal with the luggage and the child at the same time at the airport.  Even if someone is with you to get you on, you still have to get off and then back on without help.

Az8XgIbVaa	I wouldn't be too concerned about this issue until you are around 28-30 weeks pregnant. (When you are advised my the doctor to do the fetal kick counts.)  Right now your baby is still so small. Around the 6th-7th month the baby's movements should pick up A LOT.  I had the same concern at 22 weeks and went to the hospital for fetal monitoring, and you could hear the baby moving a ton, but I didn't feel it.  The nurse told me some women don't even feel the baby at 22 weeks. :)<br>  <br>  My doctor said nothing should be a cause for concern unless the baby isn't moving AT ALL. <br>  <br>  I just now started to feel the baby on a regular basis at around 28 weeks.  Before that, movements varied.  Some days I would feel a lot, some days I would barely feel anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0MUvGlHkaa	mom to be will have questions and doubts is my baby moving enough too much etc. though yr baby will most certainly be on the move most times you may not feel unless its a power punch. some can be due to fetal position facing and kicking inward for instance instead of outwards. if yr active u may b putting bub to sleep and also possible that your sleeping thru yr baby;s most active period. baby's tend to act up when mum is laying down so lay down for an hr or 2 in the evening have juice milk or a snack the combination of yr inactivity and jolt of food energy may get yr baby moving. if still worried call yr practitioner.|`|55l7x4Lqaa	I had the same thing with my oldest son and the midwife gave me a 'kick' chart to fill in and i remember being so worried! however, he is 16 now, 6ft 4 and still growing and perfectly healthy!<br>  good luck with it all - try not to worry too much! x|`|GfphOIdOaa	Not necessarily. It could be the baby has less room to kick or has turned into a position where you can't feel it kicking. It is however always a good idea to visit a doctor if you have any concerns.|`|SndrZbn8aa	One thing you can do is count any movements you feel. Lie on your left side and time how long it takes to feel 10 movements. If it takes longer than three hours then you need to get to the hospital. <br>  <br>  This website has some more info on kick counts:<br>  <a href="http://www.babykick.com/Resources_KickCountFAQs.html#13" rel="nofollow">http://www.babykick.com/Resources_KickCo...</a>

Joz0jTwGaa	much progress has been made and nowadays v tiny babies can also survive. 24 weeks.. well my guess wd be:<br>  - respiratory problems - lungs may not have developed.<br>  - long stint at ICU (3 months or more)<br>  - post recovery also development lags and perhaps digestion problems<br>  - baby may not suck and may not tolerate formula well<br>  <br>  overall huge expenses<br>  <br>  but a very caring parent can offset all of the above by physical and emotional love and attention. A lot of hard work may be involved and the parent may have to forego living for about 6 - 8 months.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|cJRFbZUaaa	24 weeks is generally considered the "limit of viability."   That's when the baby has at least a 50% chance of long term survival, but there is still a risk of the baby being significantly disabled.|`|XTf9VaLoaa	my sister sister has is a dr n has started looking after prem babies. she told me that at 21 weeks the baby has a 50/50 chance in that increase every week n ii know at at 27 weeks 9/10 babies survive i dnt really know bout the weeks between x
2E9pG4j5aa	the chances of the baby surviving is like 70 percent if the mother has been giving a course of steroids over 48hours. however the chances of the baby having long term health problems is very high, like chronic lung disease, a PDA, brain damage and many other things with PDA been the biggest problem because it requires heart surgery on the tiny baby. my son was born at 27 weeks and he is now a perfectly healthy 9 month old. i am friends with 2 mothers that i met in the neo natal intensive care unit. one whos baby was born at 24weeks and 3 days. her baby elle is doing really well shes been home 5months now and has no major problems. and another whos baby was born at 25 weeks and her baby is still on a bit of oxygen but has been home 5 months aswell and was only readmitted to hospital for a small hernia repair operation. ok i hope this helps if you need to know anything else feel free to email me. best of luck xoxox|`|eC1dQVcgaa	I don't think the chances of surviving would be great at all, not at 24 weeks.<br>  You can still abort at 24 weeks, and if it is a multiple. Not good at all.<br>  Hope who ever it is gets through it =]
byqO5WRaaa	Wow what a scary time for you. I am a NICU nurse and am confronted with infants born at this gestation on a regular basis. I am going to be as honest as I can right here and not sugar coat the information. It is so important for you to understand that these babies do have the potential to face lifelong illnesses and deficits. However I do see miracles everyday and have seen 24 weekers go home with very little problems! Infants born that early are at an extremely high risk of not surviving-greater than 50%.. but it is definately possible. Sometimes the infants that were more "stressed" inside the womb do come out slightly more mature however because they were forced to mature more quickly to handle the stressed environment. So it is possible that the infant expected to be the "weaker" one may actually fare better than its twin. Infants born at 24 weeks gestation will be placed on ventilators immediately. They have potential to have issues with their blood pressures, glucose levels, intestines, lungs, and brain fuction within the first several weeks of birth. The potential problems for an infant of this gestational age are brain bleeds/brain damage, cerebral palsy, hearing and vision deficits, feeding difficulties and intolerance, increased rate of infections, liver damage, intestinal problems, and developmental delays. Of course  some babies can escape the NICU with only minor difficulties, while others can end up with lifelong challanges. I wish both twins the best of luck and health in their NICU journey as well as to the parents. It is a very difficult road and they will need your support!|`|Az8XgIbVaa	I found this online... hopefully it helps somewhat.<br>  <br>  The longer your baby is in the womb, the better the chance he or she will be healthy. Babies who are born prematurely are at higher risks for brain and other neurological complications, as well as breathing and digestive problems. Some premature babies grow up with a developmental delay, and/or have learning difficulties in school. The earlier in pregnancy a baby is born, the more health problems are likely to develop.<br>  <br>  Premature labor does not always result in premature delivery. Some women with premature labor and early dilation of the cervix are sometimes put on bed rest until the pregnancy progresses further.<br>  <br>  Most babies born prior to 24 weeks have little chance of survival. Only about 50% will survive and the other 50% may die or have permanent problems. However, babies born after 32 weeks have a very high survival rate, and usually do not have long term complications.<br>  <br>  Babies born at hospitals with neonatal intensive care units (NICU) do best. If you deliver at a hospital that does not have a NICU, you may be transferred to a nearby hospital.|`|qUkx8msxaa	hello , what an awful thing to be faced with, i have had two prem babies but one was a boy born 35 weeks and he was very ill and a girl born at 34 weeks did amazingly well, it does not always depend on the gestation of the pregancy but the health of the baby, also little girls tend to do better than boys, sometimes baby is safer out than in which leaves no option but to deliver,it depends alot on the surrounding circumstances, it is difficult do judge until the baby is born how mature or howmuch of a fighter the baby is, steps willbe taken to help baby mature in the form of steriod injections to mature the lungs, however a baby born prior to 30 weeks is classed as extremly prem and will have a fight on its hands and can develop some nasty complications, 24 weeks is not a good gestationto be delivering a baby  but if there is no other option all will be done to save the little one, as for multiples and one being weaker i am not sure but the neonatal unit at  the hospital will throughly discuss all concerns, risks etc however a friend ofmine delivered at 28 weeks and her son did amazingly well, <br>  breathing problems ios themain issue then feeding is the next biggy,complications such as bleeds onthe brain and brain damage, learning difficulties are a big worry with extreme prem babies.<br>  best of luck x
vI0WnAiOaa	thats lovely, your kids only turn one once and its a real milestone to be celebrated. i must admit i didnt do fancy invites but did do a big celebration - of course its more for the adults more than the kid as truelly they wont remeber, but you will. are you having a princess theme? i didnt have a theme for my first - just all the poeple i could muster up and had a great big bbq in the park, for my next i had a butterfly theme with her little playgroup friends.<br>  believe me nothing is too cheesy for a first birthday - you do what you feel is right.<br>  as for the invite i would leave out the '1st' bit out as you have already stated its been a year and you mention turning one later so you dont need that bit.<br>  so read:<br>  we cant believe its been a year! our daughter .......... 's birthday is already here! would be better.|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	I think it's very sweet. My only issue is that the second sentence doesn't flow right - it's a little too long so the rythym seems off. It would sound perfect if you omitted the word "already" (which is superfluous anyway), so it reads: "We can't believe it's been a year! Our daughter, Aundrea Marie's, first birthday is here!"|`|shKc7lZcaa	That is so cute!  And it will be nice to show her when she is older and can appreciate the thought that you put into it.  I agree with "Kells" change of the first two sentences though.  I think it flows better that way.  Good job Mom ;)|`|axWE0Ag3aa	They're adorable!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its a good one|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I like it and think that the rhyming just makes it even more suitable as an invitation for a first birthday.

75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i used a bumper pad with both of my children. for that reason. i guess its just a personal choice, but usually by the time they can roll over to the point of getting near the pad, they can turn their head well enough if they can't breath. i took mine out when my kids could stand, i didn't want them standing on the pads to try to escape:)|`|AA11330115	In my opinion, when the bumper pads are in the crip correctly, then there shouldn't be any worry...they are there so your child doesn't bang his head on the rails, and in your case, to keep his legs where they belong...I would put them back. I have never had any problem with the bumper pads with my kids.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	we have a mesh type bumper which goes around the cot and if they stand on it it just goes down so the child doesn't get any level to climb over.<br>  its called a air wrap, but im in Australia so i dont know if u can get it where u are|`|KqloS80maa	i think it depends on the age now a newborn baby there not going to pull on it ..but when the baby gets big enough i would take it off|`|7K6vpsdhaa	I have been using a bumper pad since my boy was put in his crib and he has only started to pull at it and he's 5 months. I've never had any problems and as long as it's tied on properly it shouldn't come off. Once your baby starts to pull themselves up you should then take it off.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	If the rails on your crib as so close that baby's leg can get stuck between them, it's dangerous regardless of whether it has a bumper pad over the top. If he can easily pull his leg out, what's the problem?<br>  <br>  No, you shouldn't put it back on. It reduces airflow around baby and significantly increases the chance of SIDS. Which would you rather - go in to find baby with a leg through the bars yelling because he can't figure out how to get it out, or baby dead? It's not like he's going to lie there in silence if he gets in a tangle.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely MUST cover the bars or rails, then go buy some of those mesh bumpers which the air can flow through easily.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	dont put him so close to the rails <br>  dont use the pads
zBwyfE92aa	hmm, just as when I was a teenager, CERTAIN girls indulged into this kind of behavior. It is unfortunate that your daughter seemingly is one of those girls.

No. Your daughter sounds naive and must have some serious self-esteem issues if she's allowing herself to be violated this way.
bFfWFsFWaa	Mr.Goodkat obviously has never been in this situation before...<br>  <br>  <br>    Anyways, I'm not a parent, but it doesn't take a parent to tell you that this is indeed, unfair. My mom died when I was young, and whenever my dad got a girlfriend, it caused some issues. There were a couple of them that were tolerable...and a couple of them that I loved. But then there were a few who I just could not stand...sometimes I had no reason at all. Just something about them. So no, it is not childish. I have a brother who is ten years older then me and he goes through the same emotions about the situation as I do. <br>  <br>    You're mom is being ridicules. And in my opinion (and an adults opinion...because I did as someone before I responded)...your mother is being the childish one. First of all, she needs to learn about this thing called a self esteem. I don't mean to sound like a psychologist, but what the hell does she do to your self esteem when she makes you out to be a chore rather then a loving kid? She wants to send you to your dad because you're a responsibility? You need to sit down and chat with her and tell her what exactly she sounds like. Most parents are over joyed when kids want to spend more time with them. At least from what I've seen. (And I've seen a lot. My boyfriends mom is a custody lawyer). <br>  <br>  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HERE IS WHAT YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  First of all, sit down with your mom and explain to her that as a parent, she needs to pay a bit more respect to your feelings. Tell her that she is right when she says she has no say in who your father dates, but you should have a say in what takes place in your life. You never asked for the divorce, and now you're the one to suffer. Flat out tell her that she's being a bit selfish and immature. She went through the divorce...which affected you greatly...and now she's treating you like a big chore rather then a kid. Tell her you want to be treated better...but remain calm and collected. You won't get anywhere being a brat :)<br>  <br>  Secondly, tell her that YOU will talk to your dad. Since this is your decision, you need to deal with it. Sit down with your dad and explain to him what exactly is going on. Tell him you'll visit and still be available to do stuff with him (and mean it, he's still your dad and has a right to date)...but you just don't want to live there. It's not fair to make you live that way...it really isn't.<br>  <br>  And third. What may help your case is doing things for your Mom. She probably didn't mean to make it sound like you were such work to keep around, but I'm sure that when you're at your dads, she found peace and quiet. Make sure you step up a bit, and start doing chores around the house. Go the extra step to make your life with you mom a bit better. Cook, clean, do dishes...whatever..just help her out a bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know I'm not an adult, but you don't need an adults opinion on this one. Anyone who is divorced is going to tell you you are being childish. I think it's hard for parents sometimes to really think about the kids...no matter how hard they try. Give both your parents some slack. They deserve to be happy as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Edit* By the way....the young ones never stick around. They always find boys their own age who are better looking...and then they leave the older men. Don't worry. She won't last. It will get to be to much for it. It almost always is.<br>  <br>  Oh and dreamer, get lossed. I'm sure your situation is great and your family loves you, but you're not the rest of the world. Are you a 20 year old dating someone who is twice your age? Because if you arn't, then you really have no room to talk..your situation may not have been as awkward and tough as hers is. And if you are? Well that's just disgusting.|`|1guDp259aa	well guys have sertan  needs.. but if ur dad is pushing u away for them then thats disgusting.. and ur mum is just thinking about her self..|`|A4G03Bzbaa	When I'm 47 and divorced/seperated I really hope I can be bumping uglies with a 20 year old.  Right on pops!!!!<br>  <br>  Unfair, yes.  She is using you to make your dad and his girlfriends life miserable.  She knows that you being with your dad and his girlfriend will cause tension and thus making life hell for them.  Thats my opinion.|`|AA11254601	your mother is being totally unfair.  she should be thinking about you as her daughter, not her own personal comfort.<br>  <br>  As far as your dad's girlfriend is concerend, your going to have to deal with her since you know your dad's wanting this women in your life.  I think the best thing to do is to try and treat her as an equal, and see if the two of you can find some common ground.  Think of it this way, would you be more willing to be her friend if your dad wasn't interestd in her?<br>  <br>  your dad may be going through a phaze, and he may keep this girl for a month, or for a few years.<br>  <br>  Just try to get to know her, and let her know that while you can't see her as an authority figure, you can see her as an equal, and ask that she respect you and do the same.<br>  <br>  This situtations are akward, to say the least.  Good luck, hon.|`|1caa6e9202544c5458c9c4eed7baa473aa	I'm also divorced - mum of 3 and will never force my children to go to their dads.

You maybe be suprised to see you 2 can be somewhat friends.

I have to talk to him every week [believe it or not] and remind him that in our lives, its no longer just the 2 of us.. and then it hits him hard that he was being a prick all this time so he just gets up and plays, feeds or just carries our little one around :)<br>  <br>  All they need, is to come back to REALITY|`|1JGj56TFaa	Absolutely!!!  A new baby brings so many changes to a relationship both good and bad.  We have a 5 year old and a 6 month old and we argue lots and its mostly about the kids too!!!  I think its perfectly normal and the sign of a healthy relationship.  How boring would it be if you didnt argue?????!!!!!  I wouldnt worry too much about it. x|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	yes, my husband and i fought for 3 months after each baby, hang in there.|`|cJ3IiZzsaa	out of curiousity what do you guys fight about?|`|pDRAciBnaa	we did argue alot for the first few months after holly was born,now i am pregnant and i have a new batch of hormones....so i generally pick fights for him just to ignore me (hes not the argumentative type) and me to then get even madder. im sure when the new baby arrives we (well i) will continue to argue. its not all the time,but yes i does happen rather often :(|`|heoBp6Taaa	You both want the best for your daughter and both think your idea's/ways are the best. Do you full on fight or just disagree?<br>  Sometimes you just have to agree to disagree. My husband and I were a little testy with each other for about 6 months just adjusting to life with our little 1 lack of sleep and I was very hormonal and insecure. Maybe you need to have some "special" time with your husband and make sure you show each other that you do love them and appreciate them. Hope it all works out for you.
0NdBx2keaa	Yes. Humans are a virus of the Earth, but we have the ability to gain globally consciousness and live in harmony with the Earth once again.<br>  <br>  People: Stop having so many kids and stop driving so damn much!|`|AA12262106	You're not opinionated are you?<br>         I think that procreation is a personal choice and that people should have as many kids as they want.<br>         Your limit of 1 or none only fits in well with the Chinese Communist theology. Maybe you should think of relocating.|`|EGEOOZLXaa	Well, if we knocked you off, at least that would be one less. Are you volunteering, because - as you say - we need to get rid of some people. <br>  <br>  Bullocks! You can fit the entire world's population inside the State of Florida. It's all a lie. We're not overpopulated. Go visit Montana sometime.|`|BU3A3rR4aa	its not our problem if they want kids let them have kids ... you cnt say whats right or wrong for another person ...thats their life. if they like to have children than thats what it is ! DEAL WITH IT|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i think as long as you can care for your child (including financially) it is just fine. of course, you need to love and care for your child, but love cant buy them diapers and formula. if you are struggling with no children, chances are having many kids is just going to place the burden on hard working tax payers and that is just not fair.<br>  <br>  i have a very close family friend who has 13 kids ranging from 23 years old to 24 months old. yeah, thats a s h i t load of kids, but she and her husband work VERY hard and do a WONDERFUL job providing for those kids.. happiest kids i know actually.. the parents pay for a charter school, pay for health insurance for EACH and EVERY child, teach them how to be good people and are just wonderful parents.<br>  <br>  then theres octo-mom...|`|E5eZn9rcaa	Yeah, me too.<br>  I had a relative who squeezed out 6 kids until she finally had a boy. 'Course she shoved each screaming baby to her eldest daughters and instead spent her time working. Not really much of parenting.<br>  <br>  But yeah, in my opinion there are children out there that are ignored and stepped on because they are unwanted. I want to be like my grandfather who adopted and raised three kids during his retirement. Seems more worth it.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	I want a big family. There is nothing wrong with wanting a big family. Yes it would be shity for the rest of the world- but there are no laws and almost certainly people think 'oh dont exagerate'. <br>  I am not selfish or ignorant- I want to do what my body naturally wants to + its why Im here isnt it?|`|3fcfd4d7bc4f0ec25226893409bc8af5aa	A person can have as many kids as they want, IF they're married. That's how I feel.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 6, and me and my husband are expecting our second child. After this child, I'm having my tubes tied, because 2 children is good enough for me. I guess whatever floats a person't boat. But I cant see myself with a lot of kids|`|UZYhNpFVaa	Just wondering.. did you vote for our current president??? You must have..."spread the wealth"...(lets give BANKS the money we DON'T have, rather than FAMILIES... which..

I do know how you feel, but I do realize that people are going to have as many children as they want.|`|E9u93RVoaa	yes, and I am selling my children to the highest bidder for crack money. or just crack. please look me up if your interested.|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	yes have you seen that family on tv with 18 kids|`|KpAGfXmJaa	What a horrible thing to say. My parents have had seven kids, but they are completely self sufficient, do not rely on government handouts, and all my siblings are intelligent, wonderful human beings, not spawn of a 'virus'.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Overpopulation is only a problem in some areas of the world, mostly underdeveloped countries. In countries like New Zealand, the baby boomer generation is reaching retirement, and there is now not enough children/young adults to support them, thanks to people not having kids. Hence the large amount of immigrants needed to boost the economy. Get your facts straight before you start making ignorant and insulting statements like this.|`|YA2WC24Kaa	who cares as long as they can love and support them. and that statement is flawed "The Earth is overcrowded." Look up DINCS - double income no children compared to couples with children statistics nowadays. And if you're talking about 3rd World countries having too many babies - look up longevity and infancy death rates. And also you may want to look up China's birth policy. No offense but population is slowly decreasing NOT increasing.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I think it is NONE of mine or anyones bussiness how many children a person wants to have..|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	no.. as long as someone can care for tons of kids without assistance then I am fine with it. Then there are those who get pregnant with twins or triplets naturally or with IVF...some with a little more (4-8) which is not common...but if you can afford IVF then you can afford those kids (except in octomom's case....then it's wrong)
RuKK1LYiaa	Take a freaking test, your more than likely pregant and if you are you need to get to a dr. soon so they can give you the information and vitamins you need, oh and if the prenatal vitamins make you sick to your stomach stop taking them and take the Flintstones chewable's with iron in them, thats what i had to do and what my dr. told me to do.|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	probably yes.

AA11330115	Your milk will come in after the birth of your baby...usually 2-5 days after the birth...so don't worry about it.|`|3r9JATQEaa	For some it can come early, however in general/ for me.. it came about 3-4 days after the baby.
tn3CCytmaa	Well <br>  <br>  some times it happens but this is not true for all women who are breastfeeding|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yes- if you are breast feeding every 2-3 hours around the clock every day.  If you cut back even one feeding a day your periods will come back.|`|VClxXNs3aa	not for everyone.  some women dont get their period til they stop BFing but I exclusively BFed my daughter til 6.5 months when we started solids, my period came back regularly at 3 months.  also it isnt 100% true that you cant get pregnawhile BFing I got pregnant when she was 7 months.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	not true<br>  <br>  i breastfed my daughter and had my period regularly the whole time.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	no.. I bf'ed for 4 months and got mine in month 2|`|I1Fnj0rHaa	no u will get ur period|`|AA11330115	No...you will get your period during breasfeeding...it just takes a bit longer to get started...breastfeeding holds it off for a little bit.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	your period holds off a few more weeks after giving birth when you breastfeed then when you dont. but you should be getting your period within the next few months even if you are still breastfeeding|`|U3fwQPcjaa	No, this is not true.
f46kNPvdaa	You poor thing! I know just what you mean - I suffered terrible food oversion during the early weeks of my pregnancy. I found that chamomile and honey tea or ginger (tea or biscuits) would settle my stomach and a little fresh air would do wonders for the nausea! Not too sure about the extra saliva, but I'd guess it's your body's reaction to feeling sick; try sticking to the blander foods and plenty of fresh water to see if that helps. Everyone is different when they're pregnant but your body quite often has a natty way of knowing just what you need to satisfy it, it's just a case of trial and error!<br>  Good luck!|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Ginger is supposed to be a good natural anti-sickness. It helped me - try ginger biscuits, or powdered ginger in a cuppa tea.|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	take pepto or tylonal that works for me :]|`|j7fzuDxgaa	i know you don't want to eat but try to nibble on a ginger biscuit it really help me. i don t like ginger but it worked for me , good luck|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Have you tried the Morningwell CD?

RuKK1LYiaa	well even if he didnt ejaculate you could still get pregnant from pre-ejaculation, shockingly its rare but does happen and thats how i ended up with my son, you can also get pregnant with anal sex due to the fact that the walls are thin enough for the sperm to make there way through, wait and see if you get another period and if not take a test. your probably not pregnant though so dont stress and just wait it out.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just noticed you said you starved yourself....ignore what i said before your NOT pregnant at all,just completely STUPID. starving yourself can cause major damage to your body and can even result in kidney failure and other bad things, if you want to lose weight eat healthy foods and exercise.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You starved yourself to lose weight? You're not very bright, are you?<br>  <br>  I would say that your dizziness and nausea is NOT indicative of pregnancy, more likely it's a result of you abusing your body by starving yourself for a week.<br>  <br>  Don't be so bloody stupid in future.

yZDyUfSNaa	I personally think it depends on the child and what they are eating. My son has never been a good pooper, he's 2.5. For his first year he only went once a week. As he got older and switched to regular food, he started going more frequently and we even reached a point where he did go once a day. Now we're back to once every other day or so. For us, I totally see a correlation between how much milk he drinks and how frequently he has a bowel movement. If he has a lot of milk, which is binding, he will only go once every few days, even though he has a decent diet that includes lots of fiber and other liquids. <br>  <br>  The biggest key is to watch what and how your child goes to the bathroom. If it's easy for him (i.e. he's not straining) and the poop is soft, it's fine if he only goes every other day. If he is straining, says it hurts etc., and the poop is hard and dry, he's probably constipated and it's time to discuss it with his doctor, especially if it is a constant, not a one off type thing. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if your child goes 5 times a day, it's also time to see a doctor. Twice a day can be normal, heck some adults go 2-3 times a day, again, it all depends on the child. Again, what's the stool like? soft but formed? Or runny and liquidy? Is your child sore from going so often? Etc.|`|AA11109728	Generally, once a day.  However, it's perfectly normal to poop twice in a day or to skip a day.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	my 2 year old poops twice a day|`|AA11254601	it is healthy for a person of ANY age to go twice a day.

Anything less needs treatment.|`|3RUzjWUjaa	THE BOWEL MOTION FREQUENCY DEPENDS ON THE TYPE F FOOD GIVEN..<br>  FORMULA FED CHILDREN TEND TO POOP LESS FREQUENTLY ie: 3 to 5 tmes/Day.. <br>  whereas the  BREAST FED children hav a ease in passing stools whihc are soft and at a frequency of 10 times/day or atleast 1ce in 10 days....<br>  At 2 to 3 years of age the modal frequency of defecation is 2 bowel motions per day.<br>  WHICH MEANS THE NORAM NUMBER OF TIMES A 2-YR OLD  CHILD SHOULD POOP 2-3 TIMES A DAY
AA11425948	I done the same thing and the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. So after that i just referred to it as my baby balling up in a ball to get warm and cuddly so when i see them sleep now with their butt up in the air it reminds me of what they were doing in the womb. So precious|`|f46kNPvdaa	I wouldn't worry it sounds perfectly normal - I'm also 32 weeks and know exactly what you mean. As the baby is getting bigger it cannot 'somersault' to the same extent as it used to so it feels more like persistent pushing than kicks and punches. If it isn't causing you any pain then you should be just fine, but personally I'd always say to mention it to your doc, it never hurts! Ask what the presentation of the baby is (head down etc) and then perhaps you can play the guessing game of trying to decide which of baby's body parts are sticking out! It made me feel better anyway! Hope all goes well with the rest of your pregnancy - not long now x|`|1jwbQaZTaa	this sounds totally normal. i remember i would feel my daugther putting pressure on one side or right behind by belly button.. a lot of pressure.. and her movements were more strength and stretches than kicks and stuff.. its a diff feeling once your used to little kicks and punches. its totally normal.|`|VhCw4Pvyaa	this could be because your baby is rapidly running out of room.

I still have a little overhang.<br>  <br>  I got pregnant again and went on to have a normal delivery and my shape went back to how it was before the third pregnancy very quickly.<br>  <br>  Claire
4CMx1uzXaa	If your wife is cheating on you because you are becoming bald- then your relationship is on the rocks...!|`|E9u93RVoaa	OH SNAP! ***** gonna get SMACKED!|`|1KjWWptTaa	well she must of cheated on you if she is having a baby with somone else ?
tn3CCytmaa	Well<br>  <br>  It can be difficult as I your first delivery must have a cause of <br>  C-section so it could be the reason of C-section again .<br>  <br>  Any way if you have C-section then you must givat leastst 3 years break . other wise your body will not gain the same energy again .|`|1giBkGvraa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It's  a myth that you cant after having 1 section.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	There is no definate reason why you should have to have another section.  Although it could depend on why you had the first section in the first place.  If it was for the baby's position (ie it was breech or transverse) then it's unlikly to happen again.  <br>  <br>  I had 2 sections followed by a normal delivery - I am pregnant again and fully intend to have another vaginal delivery.<br>  <br>  Do as much research as you can and make yourself as fully aware as you can with all the pros and cons.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!<br>  Claire|`|AA11330115	You really can't be sure at this stage in your current pregnancy...it all depends on how your labor goes...my first baby was a C-section, and since then I have brought 3 more into this world naturally. Best to discuss this with your doctor.
1jwbQaZTaa	im only 22 weeks but this is my second pregnancy.. <br>  <br>  with my first.. every week down really didnt feel like much progress.. it felt like forever.<br>  <br>  but i assure you, it will all FLY by until you hit the last 2 weeks.. those drag on FOREVERRRr and the day you go into labor you will still remember when you took your pregnancy test.. it passes all too soon and i promise you'll miss that bump after you have your baby and see a pregnant woman.. im sure every mama on here will agree!!<br>  <br>  your almost there though.. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|KqloS80maa	it sounds like your having one of them days lol .. some days u love it other u cant wait for it to be over but it will all be over and u will actually miss it ...sounds crazy but very true...i still tho im pregnant with my son i miss how i felt my daughter too|`|BU3A3rR4aa	Im 31 weeks pregnant and i deal with it ! its nothing u can do to go back now ... in fact it will get bigger and bigger....|`|MFsuN8Doaa	I'm 40 weeks, and waiting for this baby to come, and believe me, if you feel huge now, you haven't seen anything yet. I was in my maternity ward the other day, and a lady who had twins commented on how massive I am. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping they will now induce me because I'm in so much pain!!!<br>  <br>  Oh and EDIT - I measured my bump and it's a massive 50 inches around (where my waist was) I was 34 inches on the waist 11 months ago!|`|Bg6txvxqaa	ha! I'm havign twins and Im 22 weeks and feel like that already, god help me by the time I get to 28 weeks!<br>  <br>  Hopefully I'll be going on maternioty leave at 29 weeks so by then I won't care much lol!<br>  <br>  Not for much longer now!|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	wait til ur 34 weeks.. WOOOOO<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|F7knBX1haa	YES! I am 19 weeks and I have only gained 9 pounds, but the circumference of my belly is 45 inches. I am only gaining weight in my stomach. Everyone tells me you are so BIG. Yeah, I know, just everyone does not have to tell me. So, I abide by this quote: <br>  <br>  "Don't stress about how you look. You are performing a miracle — growing a person inside of you — and that is a fantastic accomplishment." <br>  <br>  Hang in There. It will all be worth it!|`|Az8XgIbVaa	It's called pregnancy. <br>  Your stomach gets larger.<br>  You gain weight.<br>  Most women do feel like a whale.<br>  <br>  But it's a beautiful thing, if people felt so negatively about it they would stop reproducing.|`|rniBQ9NPaa	I felt like that when i was pregnant. I gave birth 18 days ago...u think u r huge now, but its nothing compare to what u will be in the last month, be patient...if u deliver normally, u can loose all those soon.|`|MW3Br5V8aa	I felt huge at 28 weeks too, but try not too focus on ur body, i know its hard, just eat properly try eat right so that when ur bundle comes along u will go back to normall..
