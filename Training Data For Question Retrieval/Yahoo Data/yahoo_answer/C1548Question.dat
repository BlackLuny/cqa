20090128131337AAmlTMr	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Looking for some advice from my fellow Muslim sisters please?	Assalamu 3alaykum wr wb,      So here's the deal. I was raised in the West and I discovered the beautiful religion of Islam about two and a half years ago. During this period, I briefly lived in a North African country but I found it difficult to adapt to due to there being a language barrier, no Arabic lessons available, and not knowing many people who I could count on for support. I now reside in Europe but I'm finding that the environment where I live isn't really conductive towards practising Islam properly. I live in a tight knit community, which generally isn't very accepting of other cultures and identities, and all of my friends are white. I try my best to keep to my Islamic duties but I find it's easy sometimes, because of other commitments, to fall into a bad pattern and not perform the prayers within their designated times. Moving to an Arab country seems an attractive solution to me right now because I know from experience that I'm a better Muslim when I'm in that environment. I guess what you could call the problem is that I don't speak Arabic, I'm a single female and I don't have family living in any of these countries that would be able to help me out. I'm currently coming towards the end of a university degree and, being honest with you, I am considering the prospect of getting married in the near future, inshAllah. Among the other things specified above, I've been wondering how young Muslim females who are new to the Islamic faith would normally go about seeking marriage opportunities with pious Muslim men. To the sisters who are married or engaged, what steps did you take to get to where you are now? Also, what advice would you have for somebody in my situation who is looking to move to a more Islamically embracing community and possibly get married along the way?      Any suggestions you have would be most welcome.   Many thanks, wassalamu 3alaykum wr wb.

20090128131418AAEOuHI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to Develop a Relationship with God? ?	Hi,   This question is for believers only...   So, how would you describe your relationship with God (in detail, please)?    What do you exactly do to, for, or with God ?    How can I develop a relationship with God?    How can you tell God likes what you are doing for Him?    Why do some people think that religion or following some rules makes one distant from God? Why do some people think that if you aren't a son or daughter of God that you have a lesser relationship? Why do some Christians think that the Christian relationship with God is superior to other relationships?

I heard this idea put forth by Peter Enns.. if you don't know about him, he's a very controversial theologian who was dismissed from Westminster Theological Seminary for his book 'Inspiration and Incarnation', which challenged the concept of inerrancy.      Anyways, I read an article of his recently where he suggested that in a very real sense our theology is fallen, and we cannot expect a perfect theology where everything makes sense or fits. What do you think about that idea?

The second letter of Paul to the Corinthians chapter 5 verse 6-10   "We continue to be confident. We know that while we dwell in the body we are away from the Lord. We walk by faith, not by sight. I repeat, we are full of confidence, and would much rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. This being so, we make it our aim to please him whether we are with him or away from him. The lives of all of us are to be revealed before the tribunal of Christ so that we each one may receive his recompense, good or bad, according to his life in the body."

20090128131853AAfQ51m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I can sense that evil/bad things are coming?	This might sound retarded coming out from a 14 year old but... Every sense 3 months ago, when my sister checked out her new apartment i felt weird... like i was in a scary movie... The next day it was raining and thundering/lighting. Our family was trying to move my sister's stuff in her new apartment and suddenly there was lighting and thunder. The tree/branches were EVERYWHERE on the streets and there were accidents and some people died because of this vile storm. My heart starts to pound, and i knew today was gonna be a bad day cuz i sensed it from yesterday... My stomach feels pain, i feel a sense of spirtial feeling telling me to watch out for tmmrw.... And i can't really describe the feeling.. But this only happens when something bad is gonna happen to me or other people.      This is the same thing as my sister (who moved in her new apartment) whenever her left eye twitches, something bad is gonna happen in a couple of hours. My sister prays to God for protection.      Is this a special power that the Lord gave us? Is it possible for Christians to sense evil things coming?       And yes i did tell my parents and my pastor but they ignored the fact that i was telling the truth.      Please don't make fun of me or say "stupid 14 year old! Stop making this up!!" This is true. I need some answers so i can continue my life as a healthy 14 year old Christian.

20090128132623AAq4kBs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do the members of some religions lie more than the members of others?	All religions are based on lies so every time a religious person promotes or defends their religion, by default they are lying. Whether or not it’s a conscious lie or an inadvertent lie is a matter of some debate but the fact that they are not telling the truth is beyond doubt. But do you think that some religions require a greater evasion of the truth than other religions, particularly the proselytizing religions? Don’t be shy; feel free to name and shame the religions you think tell the biggest porky-pies…

20090128132619AAaAd0G	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is your most fundamental belief - what mindset affects the larger part of your life?	For instance, a holocaust survivor named Sandor Teszler held to the belief that "all human beings are fundamentally good".  It was idealistic certainly, but he undeniably made impact for the good in others by inspiring a higher standard....both at a personal and a social level.  www.readersdigest.com/dunlap      What belief/mindset do you hold to which profoundly affects your decisions, your choices, your life?  Are your core beliefs positive, indifferent or destructive?        What experience or person inspired this general mindset in you, and would you go back and change it if you could?        (I put this question on the R&S board, but your response does not necessarily have to be religious.  All men have fundamental beliefs about themselves and the world around them - whether they believe in God or not.)      Thank you.

Call a meeting of the most respected Protestant sects, write your own religious doctrine. As an added benefit, you can put whatever you want in it!

I took the g-kids to Mc D's this morning and they talked me into taking them to the park, so they could play in the snow. (It snowed about 7 inches here last night).   Why not ? I don't have any thing else to do, and they're out of school (snow day, schools closed), so, off we went.      Well, I gotta tell ya, I forgot HOW to NOT"play" in the snow.    YOU DON'T RUN !    If you run, you fall down !. Then the kids are on you like "white-on-rice", pelting you with slush balls and dumping hand fulls of cold snow down the back of your shirt.   I then realized that it's been a long time since I "played" in the snow.   (No worries though, I got the little "scamps" back, hehehehe).

20090128133341AAaeLjQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	2 questions for nondenominational Christians regarding my bf and I?	Ok well I'm 18 and my bf is a Christian (nondenominational) and so are my parents. I'm going to be baptized very soon into that faith because I want to live that way as well.      1. We've been dating for about a month and we feel very strongly about each other. Of course we know that no matter what sex comes after marriage, but we're not too sure where our boundaries are. It's embarrassing to ask this in person, but my bf thinks that "feeling" is the furthest. I'm iffy about that...is that too far?       How do we know our boundaries, just so we don;t get carried away? (P.S. this is not for anytime soon, but just thinking ahead so I can do the right thing.)      2. Also, is it bad that he has dreams of us...doing things that come with marriage? Of course, he is thinking in terms of if SOMEDAY we were to get married. And we are not thinking this for just the physical pleasure, but we look forward to connecting on another level.       Is it wrong to even think of that? He says it's not, since we aren;t thinking of it in the wrong context, and I agree, but I want to be sure.
20090128133121AAXjBoZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	All Sins Are Equal: Murder is the same as a lie?	I know that it says this in the Bible but I completely disagree.      Example: If a man was about to be murdered and he lied to save the rest of his family, then was murdered.      The man obviously didn't ask God for forgiveness because he did what he had to do (save his family), but lets say a year after the murderer asks for forgiveness. Does the person who lied to save others go to hell and the man who murdered and then asked for forgiveness go to heaven?      All sins are equal? Murder is the same as a lie?

This happened approx 26 years ago.  I'm just concerned that he's still doing it.  I've thought about putting flyers around his neighborhood.  Can I get in trouble for doing that?  Slander perhaps?  I definitely want to confront him also.  I think I want him to know it's me.  I think he should at least believe that I'm there to hurt him (but I won't).  Any ideas would be appreciated.

I noticed that many of you living in other countries haven't been able to find the movie. Lifetime is now hosting the whole thing on their website. I only found out about the movie because of you people here talking about it. Normally i would never watch lifetime and i am not emotional but I have to admit that I turned into a big sissy and welled up because of how close to home the story is.    The mother's speech at the end of the story was really good because the idea of how the negative comments of society against gay people continually eat away at a person's sense of self worth. When that sense of self worth reaches zero, what emotional torture is placed upon that person? Is it so hard to see that the constant stream of malicious intent behind the comments people make is actually destroying the self worth of young people?    I want you all to have the opportunity to see it and i am posting the link to return the favor of the movie being mentioned to me by others here. I kind of want to show this movie to my family as well but I don't want to make my poor mother think that she is like that woman or that I am going to kill myself. Would your family take it personally?    http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/full-mov...

20090128140518AAYF0P5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Catholic Catechism and Homosexuality, an interesting read?	(Crossposted from R&S)      While checking my email and doing my standard news browsing I came across a rather interesting find.  As a former Catholic, having going to our catechism classes, it's fascinating for me to see these things laid out like this.        As stated in the Catholic Catechism:          "2358 The number of men & women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. They do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfil God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition."              "2333 Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity. Physical, moral and spiritual difference and complementarity are orientated toward the goods of marriage and the flourishing of family life."              2211 The political community has a duty to honour the family, to assist it, and to ensure especially:          * the freedom to establish a family, have children and bring them up in keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions;       * the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of the family;       * the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on and raise one's children in it, with the necessary means and institutions..."              "1935 The equality of men rests essentially on their dignity as persons and the rights that flow from it: Every form of social or cultural discrimination in fundamental personal rights on the grounds of sex, race, colour, social conditions, language or religion, must be curbed and eradicated as incompatible with God's design."              "1938 There exist also sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and women. These are in open contradiction of the Gospel: Their equal dignity as persons demands that we strive for fairer and more humane conditions... "          For those who devoutly strive to eradicate the homosexual menace, I ask you - if the fundamental teachings of the Catholic church state these things, how can hateful efforts and discrimination continue?

This is not only example but it is the most recent I have payed attention to.    I honestly mean no offense because hey at least people are getting involved but it does make me smile that we will light the torches and start marching before we look something up in a book.

20090128143139AAlUxqY	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I'm looking for ways to combat this trend?	Your comments will be more than appreciated:      How the faceless and amoral world of cyberspace   has created a deeply disturbing... generation SEX      By Olivia Lichtenstein      Last updated at 8:12 AM on 28th January 2009      Remember that Hilaire Belloc cautionary tale - Matilda told such dreadful lies, it made one gasp and stretch one’s eyes? I used to love it as a child when telling lies was one of the naughtiest things you could do: Matilda ended up getting burned to death.       These days, however, everything has changed and it’s the truths that children tell that make one gasp and stretch one’s eyes.       A couple of years ago, my daughter Francesca, then aged 13, told me about a party she had been to one Saturday night.           Insight: Olivia (left) and daughter Francesca      In the course of the evening, she came upon one of her friends, also aged 13, performing oral sex on a boy in the garden. The boy was standing and videoing the event on his mobile phone.       My daughter, in whom the feisty gene has always found strong expression, pulled her friend off the boy, knocked the phone out of his hand and slapped him round the face.       I apologise for shocking you, but then there are a number of things shocking about this event: the casual nature in which such an intimate act is performed in public, the young age of the participants and last, but by no means least, the fact that it is being filmed.       This not only signals the boy’s disassociation from the physical experience, it also indicates his intention to replay the event and, no doubt, to share his triumph with his friends as one might brandish a trophy above one’s head for all to see.       Reality TV has a lot to answer for      Nor was this the only such event on this particular evening. I am no prude, but Francesca painted a picture of Bacchanalia that certainly made me gasp.       That week at school, when conducting a post mortem of their weekend as teenagers do (and always have done), the girls at her then school (she’s since moved), a private girls’ school in London, exclaimed: ‘Hurrah, now we’re more slutty than Slutney’, the affectionate nickname of another school.       Call me old-fashioned, but when I was a gal, sluttishness was not a condition one aspired to.       That year, they were all dressing in Hooters T-shirts (the uniform of the well-endowed waitresses of a U.S. restaurant chain whose slogan ‘delightfully tacky yet unrefined’ sums up its approach) and buttock-skimming shorts.       They looked, as girls so often do, far older than their 13 years and not unlike the Playboy Bunnies who incensed a generation of feminists. (Interestingly, clothing depicting the distinctive Playboy bunny is highly popular now among teenage girls.)       When one considers our society, it’s no surprise that our children have lost all sense of modesty.           Reality check: TV's Skins glamorises teenage promiscuity      Not only do social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Bebo encourage teens to share information about themselves; but when they are not taking their clothes off, their role models are spilling their guts about their ‘private’ lives all over the pages of every national newspaper, magazine and on television.       We have an immoderate interest in the private lives of perfect strangers. Pop stars such as Amy Winehouse and Britney Spears expose the car crash that is their life for all to see.      Jordan, who won fame by revealing her breasts, has a documentary series where she and her husband, Peter Andre, discuss their sex life (or lack of it) in intimate detail.      The Osbournes revealed all for our entertainment in their television series. Was this extraordinary exposure responsible in part for the subsequent drug and alcohol abuse of the two of their children who participated? One can’t help feeling it might have been. Their third child, Amy, wisely chose to stay out of the limelight.      Whatever its exponents may say, reality television has a lot to answer for. I have been a documentary film-maker for more than two decades and am well aware of the power of the medium.      Today’s teenagers are starring in the reality show of their own lives and doing all they can to make it as dramatic as possible.       Where before mistakes we made when young - excessive drinking, acts of promiscuity - were quietly forgotten, now they are recorded and broadcast on the internet for all to see.       From happy slapping to amateur sex videos (Paris Hilton rose to fame when a shamelessly intimate video of her and her boyfriend found its way on to the internet, a reality TV show followed, and the rest, as they say, is history).       Do these girls even know what feminism is?      The sexualisation of our young is ubiquitous: boys caught cheating on their girlfriends on mobile phones, ritual humiliation and worse by YouTube (In February 2008, a gang of London teenagers aged 14-16 drugged and raped a woman in front of her children and then posted the film of the attac

20090128141838AAAaLyf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for my fellow Christians...?	I have a friend a school (Downtown community college) that's an Orthodox Christian, and she's good friends with an Orthodox muslim; and as I understand it Orthodox basically means that she and her friend are very strict,by the book,down to the letter type believers.      Anyways,the otherday she was asking questions,which was really one question; she was basically asking, how do you know when to witness,when to reach out to somebody about God. I would guess, that if she's been praying and seeking God,she's probably being convicted or moved on by God about witnessing,reaching out to people &/or her muslim friend she's close to.Cuase during the conversation (her,me,and another male friend that's also Christian) she was particulary bringing up her muslim friend.      I know how I would generally answer her;but how would you answer her question about  how do you know when &/or How to reach out and witness about God to somebody?      And I dont know if it helps;but both girls are Ethiopian;just ones Orthodox Christian, the other is Orthodox Muslim. And I'm certainly a strong spirit-filled Christian.

20090128141246AAaHj87	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I think she likes me..what should I do?	There's this girl at school who no one really seems to talk to much. I decided to step up and talk to her. I guess I didn't really think it through, and now she thinks we're best friends! Which, normally I wouldn't have a problem with..but it's just that some people at school tell me she's a lesbian. (which I also don't have a problem with.) I'm afraid she likes me.She figured out my schedule and waits outside my classes. If she doesn't see me in the hall one day, she calls me.. may I mention that she's really physical,too? She puts her arm around me and pulls on my backpack.. It makes me sort of uncomfortable. What can I do so that she takes a step back without me hurting her feelings? Is it just because she's lonely? Help please!

20090128143400AABN3Zw	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why does it seem like the black people in my school think they can disobey?	This isn't all of them, but the majority. They think that they can talk in class, back talk the teachers, be late to class, ignore the dress code, not turn in their work, not DO their work, and basically do everything else that everyone else has to do. I'm not being racist about this, but it seems they act like they are the exception to every rule.      For example, there are three trouble-making black kids in my science class. They are the only reason why our class is considered bad. One of them refused to pick up the trash that our teacher told her to. So she got in a fight with another girl who told her that she should pick it up because our teacher told us to. Today, we were lined up to go to lunch & these three people would not quit talking. Our teacher let two other classes go in front of us because they would not stop talking. Well my friend & I shushed that group of people and the one girl looked at us and said, "I know you did not just shush me, little girl." and my friend was like, "Well you were talking, so yea, I was shushing you."       It's annoying to the people who actually want to learn (me) that the black people in my classes never seem to let out teacher teach. They act like they are above everyone else & the rules do not abide by them. It's not just these three people. I only know two or three black people out of the entire school who actually listen to the rules. The rest of them could care less. Why?      I'm NOT being racist. I'm asking why. So don't even go there.

20090128144701AAtYHEf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does God play hide and seek?	Sometimes Christians state God "hides" Himself so that unbelievers cannot find Him. Only when they are prepared to believe in something that seems improbable they will be admitted to heaven.       But what is the use of that? Why is choosing for God reduced to the question whether you're able to believe something rather implausible? What is the morality in that?       (It doesn't seem necessary too: Adam and Eve are claimed to choose against Him at full sight and so could the ones who witnessed Jesus' deeds.)      So why does play God hide and seek now and why doesn't He reveal more of Himself?

Should he be charged with murder?      Many who condone abortions do so by stating that it is just a fetus, no brain, no lungs, no feelings, nothing, so if this is true then why should a guy / person be charged with murder if in fact it is nothing?  Please don't say because it was Not her choice as a woman getting an abortion gives no choice to the child she is carrying, no difference....  Also, I did not say that the guy shouldn't be charged with assault but why murder?       I am against abortions as I believe it is only selfishness.

20090128143300AAj8eEw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is '..Ya Isa inni mutawaffika..' in Koran 3:55, if Jesus did not die before his ascension to Allah? ?	Allah said in Koran 3:55 "Ya Isaa, inni mutawaffiqa ilayya..." meaning "O Jesus I shall cause you to die and I will raise you to myself..."      Every Arabic grammarian and ordinary speaker of Arabic and languages that are similar to Arabic knows that 'mutawaffika' CLEARLY means Allah would 'make Jesus die' in terms of both the literal meaning and the contextual meaning of the word and the verse respectively.      But, pathetically, in order not to contradict the verse (Koran 4:157) that denies the miraculous Resurrection of Jesus from death, 'mutawaffika' is given some very dubious translations by some 'clever' Muslims scholars and translators of Koran into English and other languages.      Thus they translate 'mutawaffika' as 'gather you' or 'take you' etc. So that the verse becomes 'O jesus I will gather you (or take you etc) and raise you to myself.      But apart from not being the meaning, at least literally, all the translations that do not imply Jesus would die, are redundant in the verse. How can God say He would 'gather' Jesus and raise him to Himself? or He would 'take' Jesus and raise him to Himself?      Do we have to tell lie to help the religion of God? I salute those Muslim scholars and translators of the Koran who give the true meaning of 'inni mutawaffika.....'.
20090128150204AAN1Bs6	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why so many relationship and dating questions posted in etiquette?	One place where etiquette rarely applies is in the dating arena.  Not that it shouldn't, it just rarely ever does.  Given that there is a clearly mark section of relationships and dating, and a page that pops up suggesting the proper groups, why do we constantly have to wade through such questions here?  The askers have an etiquette problem, but it's not the substance of what is asked, but where they ask it.      (Just a wee bit of a rant.)
20090128093325AADAokW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is God bound by the laws of his own nature?	Someone in an answer said:      God doesn't roll dice to figure anything out. He already knew where we would be, what we would be doing, etc before He ever created the Universe.      He also knew, in advance, that most people would not follow His plan for their lives, and instead live out their own plans. But, He loves them just the same.      Omnipotent means "all powerful"......God is also omnipresent (which means "everywhere, all at once"), and omniscient (which means He "knows everything about everything").      His omniscience is the reason why He doesn't need to roll the dice to figure anything out......because He already knows the past, present, and future of everyone and everywhere.      --------------------------------------      Does this mean that God himself, should he exist, has no free will? Knowing everything means he would be bound to make (or let) things happen as they are predestined. Such as the argument of can he make a rock so heavy he cannot lift it, etc. God cannot do things outside of his nature, yet it would seem his nature is severely limited. If he exists, I doubt he could be all-powerful at all. He would just be a conduit for some other forces at play, greater than himself. That would explain why he made humans, knowing they would for the most part betray him. If he really loved them, he would not create them knowing they would be punished for eternity and he could prevent it.      But perhaps, being bound by his own nature, he does love people yet cannot interfere in the least. It would make sense with all the contradictory things he's done and said.

20090128094241AAEvvYH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why has christianity become such an insecure religion?  ?	I've read many questions that pertain to christianity in the religion area and I'm surprised at the tone that folks take in asserting their points when answering.  Many are so contemptuous, demeaning and derogatory...       Why is nothing as good?     Why can no other religion exist or hold validity?     Weren't we taught to love our neighbors as ourselves?     Why do christians need to negate and invalidate other faiths?     What is so wrong with co-existence?        I KNOW what the bible says, but life has changed and move a bit forward since then... why has christianity not followed and grown?        It seems that as the religion grew older it became MORE insecure, attacking anything and everything (crusades, inquisition, converting the "heathens" of the world....)      I guess I just don't understand why it can't live and let live...

20090128093350AA7pVua	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What did God love more:  Job, or his own ego?	God eagerly accepts Satan's wager to break Job's faith, and offers him to Satan so he can torture Job to near death...just to prove that god broke poor Job's spirit even worse than Satan was able to muster.      What else does the tale of Job prove, other than that god is an insecure bully who allows the torture of his own followers -- simply to say "I told you so" to Satan and to inflate his petty ego even more than it already is?  What was the point of Job's story other than to show that god and satan are (at best) buddies...and at worst, rivals?       Then after Job's torture is over, god gives Job a new family and children.  Was god too oblivious to think that just maybe Job would have wished to see his deceased family again?  Why didn't god just bring his old family back to life?  Does god think that people could just be 'replaced', like broken toaster ovens?      Is this how god loved Job?  What is the point of the story?  Is it better to be enslaved to Satan...or to Yahweh?      Is there even a teaspoonful of common morality to be gleaned from this story?
20090128092906AAhfM2i	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians are constantly attesting ?	that they are under a "New Covenant"...are they?    Is it possible that due to their lack of scholarship that they are mistaken and have relied on emotionalism rather than textual facts from the Bible which, when recognized, dispute their claim?    The Christian may attempt to answer that verses 32 and 33 in Jeremiah are talking about the second coming, but it's absurd to say that there is at least a 2,000 year gap between verses 31 and 32. There is no indication of this gap in the text, quite the opposite, in fact. It appears as one prophecy. The Christian answer is illogical, and born of desperation.         If the Christian New Testament was really the fulfillment of this prophecy, why are their so many atheists in the world?    Why do Christians spend millions of dollars to missionize if the New Covenant has arrived and everyone "knows God"?
20090128093802AAmu3Fv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	IS THE NEW TESTAMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THE HOLOCAUST?	Within two decades of the death of Yeshua his followers had begun to attack the Jewish beliefs of their mentor. This phenomenon, by itself, would be worthy of historical inquiry, to determine how the early Christians came to regard the religion of their spiritual founder with such hostility. But the fact of Jew-hating in Christianity is of more than mere psychological or historical interest, for it formed the backdrop to centuries of persecution of Jews and ultimately led to the extermination of over 6 million of them in the Holocaust.    In the wake of the Holocaust Christians and Jews began to search seriously for the factors and causes leading to it. It became apparent to all investigators that the Holocaust could only have occurred in an environment of enormous hatred of Jews and an equal indifference to their suffering by non- participants. For the world allowed this calamity to continue for six years without intervening, as two-thirds of European Jewry was annihilated. While the anti-Semitism of the Holocaust was greater in scope than any previous mass attacks on Jews, it was not different in motive from the Crusades, the Inquisition, or the Eastern European pogroms. Every operation had, as its cause, the hatred of Jews and as its purpose their murder and plunder. In addition to the genocidal scope of the Holocaust, it had one other significant difference from previous catastrophes. There was no physical escape for its victims through conversion as in the preceding anti-Semitic movements. This was anti-Semitism based on racist theory from which there was no escape.
20090128094700AAWYCi5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, can you be truthful with yourself and answer these next questions?	The answers you give will determine if you are capable of learning truth when your now-existing values are challenged.      1. Do you consider yourself an authority on the Jewish Scriptures (the Old Testament)?   2. Do you read and speak Greek and Hebrew and feel confident about your abilities to translate Greek and Hebrew into the English?   3. If you do not read or speak Greek or Hebrew, are you well equipped to use Greek or Hebrew study aids in your study of the Bible?   4. When reading the New Testament, are you aware when reading a text that what you are reading is a quote from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament)?   5. When reading the New Testament when it quotes from the Old Testament, are you confident that the New Testament quote has been quoted accurately?   6. Are you so well versed with the Old Testament that you could spot an Old Testament passage misquoted in the New Testament?   7. Are you so well versed with the Old Testament that you could recognize a New Testament passage as a combination of parts of two different passages in the Old Testament which have not only two different contexts but originally two different intended meanings?

I walked past a woman in a grocery store this summer and she then came up to me and said that she was a prophet. She began to tell me that she had a gift from God and that years ago she had seen a woman doing prophecies for other people, and she then asked and prayed to God to bless her with the same ability. After that that she said he did and she had a message for me. She said God wanted me to go to church. I said really? She said yeah because he wants to use you. She said I was humble and he likes that. Then she she went on to say you know God loves you and...she said what you have been praying for (she said what it was, but I don't feel like mentioning it) will happen, its just some people need more help than others. But she was saying it was going to happen when I did what God asked of me (if that was him). She said if I didn't tell you I would be disobedient, so she had to tell me. She said God bless and said remember he loves you and she was on her way shopping with a little baby in the cart.  I mean what am I to make of it...it baffles me more than anything. When I was younger I did want to be a pastor but I don't know. I didn't feel any bad vibes from the lady and she sounded sincere. If it was God or holy spirit why didn't he tell me what church to go to etc...etc..etc..????

Also, once Satan is loose again, some of those people who lived under Christ's reign, will reject him and follow Satan. Is this God's way of continuing to weed out the pseudo-Christian followers?

And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:      Doesn't it mean the same thing a few chapters before? It's even in the same book.      Gen. 1: 26   26 ? And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

We love God because He first loved us and Homosexuals are not being made to feel that God loves them. What choices are we leaving them with if they feel they can not change their desires or shouldn't have to so that they can be accepted by the one who created them in the first place? Aren't Christians in essence pushing them into the fire of destruction by not letting them know how much God really loves them?

Before Being Saved, I was Ok, Not really caring, didn't really Know anything, when at Church once, Long ago, I felt this Horrible feeling of remorse, guilt, sadness, hopelessness, I don;t even remember what the sermon was about, I do know that I came to the Front, crying, sobbing, sunk to my Knees and asked Forgiveness, then at that Moment, something happened.      Let me tell you what it was not 1st.   It was NOT a Placebo effect.   It was Not, wishful thinking or any other human explanation.      At That Moment, just as I said to Jesus 'Save Me'    He touched me, Now that description is probably inaccurate, But it is the only way I can describe it, For just an instant, I was transformed.      As For me, Jesus/God is not guessing He is Real, Hoping He is Real, Not wanting to take the Chance that He isn't like a Pascals wager or anything, it is an absolute knowing that despite what anyone else say's despite what any University Professor would say or anyone else for that matter, That it is a Knowing that Goes Beyond Human Logic and Science, Far above that,   Has anyone else had this experience

Dawkins has dedicated his long working hours  in dismissing all religions,...but if only people like him with great intelligence, dedicated    his work in investigating the possibility of the human soul,   a proper investigation...with out prejudice, not just dismissing it with a wave of his hand,   then I would respect him.

Not necessarily to you personally, just something that you still remember.  For me it was one day during eighth grade during a school assembly, someone rode his motorcycle down the hallway, it was a straight hallway running behind the auditorium with the principal's office on the other side, We knew whoever did it had help because the doors were held open on each end of the hall.  All of us guessed who did, no body told and it happened so quickly that he wasn't caught. I was talking to someone at work one time at break about it a few years ago, and we discovered we both knew the person we think did it.

20090128103738AAksoKe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, do you believe that prophecy is a gift for today?	I have found that many who call themselves Bible believers do not acknowedge what the Word says, using various arguements that I can't find supported in the Word.      1CO 14:1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. 2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. 3 But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. 4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.        The Word has built in checks and balances, eg. 1CO 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.   And 1 John talks about testing the spirits.

20090225135138AAOBJTw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are some so called Christians so mean and insensitive?	After my boyfriend committed suicide, I have been through a lot. I have had so many people even strangers offered me comfort. People like them make me so proud to be just an ordinary human being.    But on the other hand, I also met some really evil people who have nothing but bad intentions.   For example, this so called "Christian" from my church told me my boyfriend is in hell. Well, I can try to respect her PERSONAL belief and or opinion. After all, everyone is entitled for his or her opinions. But do you really think it is necessarily to say it out loud to me? What's this woman's hidden agenda, what is this woman's motive? It blows my mind every time I think about it.    Like I can understand if I ask her "do you think my boyfriend is in hell?" Then she offered me her PERSONAL opinion, but I didn't ask, I didn't ask her anything.    lot of times we find that people want to enable themselves by being judgmental. Building themselves up by hiding behind the religionisms in what "they" think at the time. But waving a banner of "Christianity" doesn't make them a Christian. No more than me waving the banner of my favorite football team makes me a player on the field. And its very easy to sit back and be judgemental.       Most of them will never know what we are going through. Whether in a church or in the world....they simply do not know and honestly will never know unless they walk in our shoes. I myself have learned more about my faith, hope, and grace since my boyfriend died. And my feelings about people like the one I have met has changed alot. It is now more pity than hatred. And honestly I hope they never have to deal with this type of pain. But sometimes it is Gods grace in me that has to turn and walk away from these insensitive people.....even if it is inside a church.      Your thought?

20090128103853AAXh94k	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Even though I'm an atheist, is it strange for me to have hope in my heart ?	that religious people (any religion) will actually adhere to the true meanings of their beliefs, as opposed to simply using their belief as an excuse to practice hypocrisy, bigotry and judgment?      I respect people who truly have love in their hearts, in their beliefs, and who use that love to help those less fortunate. People who accept that there are other viewpoints, and don't feel threatened by them.      I don't respect people who seem to have forgotten what the true meaning behind their faith is, and would use it only to condemn others and perpetuate their own biased agendas.      So, is it strange for an atheist to want people of faith to set the best examples of that faith?
20090225082542AA3Xfpp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there any religious elements unique to Christian mythology, or were they all borrowed?	I've been doing research lately, and I found out that most features from Christianity were borrowed from previous religions, that's why Christianity is considered to be a ?cemetery of ancient religions?. The crucified martyr taken from hundreds of previous pagan myths, the resurrection, the semi-god. The Eucharist taken from Mythraism, and the Holy Water taken from Egyptian traditions, the walking on water inspired on the God Sun walking on the water at the sunset, the Christian Cross taken from the Egyptian Arkh, and Jesus's life written after Jehoshua Ben Pandira, from the Talmud and other scriptures found in the Rosetta stone, the Baptism taken from Jewish celebrations, etc...

Do you honestly believe someone deserves to rot in pain for all eternity for something as trivial as, say, masturbating? Or loving someone of the same gender? Or not believing in the Christian God?      What point does eternal punishment have anyway? The point of negative reinforcement is so that the person does not commit that act again - so the concept of eternal punishment is, well, pointless.

20090225082950AAaCfOL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian airline pilots:  Have you ever had the feeling there's someone standing behind you on long flights?	On several of my past flights I've had the ominous feeling someone was either standing or sitting directly behind me.  One particularly vivid example comes to mind.  In December of 1997, I was piloting a 777-200ER between Boston and London's Heathrow.  It was a flight I had flown many, many times before.  On this night, however, I distinctly recall a feeling of impending doom as I boarded the aircraft and conducted my pre-flight checks.       Several hours into the flight, when we were well over a dark and rainy North Atlantic Ocean, I was making routine notes in my flight logbook.  As I scribbled notes and checked our bearing, I began to feel what I could only describe as a dark and foreboding presence in the cockpit with me.  In short, I felt someone (or something?) was standing directly behind me.  Fighting the urge to immediately turn and confront what I felt was the incarnation of an utterly maleficent evil; I closed my eyes and began to pray silently, petitioning the Lord Our GOD to cast HIS Light of Truth upon this presence.  After several moments, I heard a slight chuckle behind me and felt the interior of the cabin become suddenly warm, almost hot. Startled, I cried out, entreating the entity to be gone.  Not able to stand the thought of a demon standing behind me any longer, I began to turn in my seat and as I did so, I felt an incredible surge of energy pass through my body.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something slip away into the shadow of the bulkhead door behind me and vanish.      At this moment, my copilot, who was known for spending perhaps a little too much time in the flight deck lavatory, popped his head out of the security door to ask me if everything was OK.  Somewhat shaken and pale, I asked him to pray with me.  As we knelt down and prayed, I felt the Love of GOD washing over us.  It was such a moving experience that I had to take a moment and excuse myself and weep silently with joy in the lavatory.  It was only when I closed the door to the lavatory behind me that I realized I had voided my bowels, soiling my trousers.      Have any of you ever had an experience like this?  And how did you confront it?  Did you turn to prayer?

Turns out I didn't make it and it was a totallll bummmerrr. It put me down. But the attention I got from my family was awesome!

I babysit a LOT so I'm very close with my family, and I have a loving boyfriend and I'm doing well in school .. so don't get me wrong, I love my life but I need something on-the-side that gives me that extra confidence boost and recognition from the things i love to do.

20090225082633AABM62U	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is church more like a social club than anything else these days?	Well I used to go to church because they had rock concerts every friday night. And although I would never impose my views upon other people and try to coerce them into believing what I believe, I'd get scrutinized for not praying enough or keeping my eyes open during the prayers. It was all a little bit hypocritical, since none of us are perfect but all of us are equal in the eyes of God. In the end, all of the younger people left the church and ended up believing the same things as me anyway.
20090128105526AAjB8bR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Evolutionists, do you perceive all human beings as equals?	I’m sure you’ve heard people say that we are all created equal. But of course, you don’t like the idea of being created.       But anyways, are human beings all equals? I suppose most of you accept Social Darwinism, but doesn’t that create problems? When you think about it, the idea of evolution devalues human life. We have no real purpose, we’re just accidents. So now it’s survival of the fittest. When you think about it, these are the ideas behind terrible things like Nazism. The Nazis perceived disabled people as being worthless drains on society, so they killed them under agonizing conditions. Evolution also supports sterilization, when the government sterilized people because they were not considered worthy of reproducing. Evolution also makes abortion okay, and abortion is victimizing the weakest members of society.      My brother is autistic. I have a great deal of compassion for helpless or disabled people, and I believe that we are all equals. Do you see how the idea of evolution devalues human life? I am NOT an accident, and neither is my brother or anyone else considered to be inferior. We should all be treated like valuable human beings, even the helpless children in the womb, but society with the help of evolution has been teaching us that we’re really just meaningless creatures that can be easily removed.

But be careful about following them. They talk a good line, but they don't live it. They don't take it into their hearts and live it out in their behavior. It's all spit-and-polish veneer.    "Instead of giving you God's Law as food and drink by which you can banquet on God, they package it in bundles of rules, loading you down like pack animals. They seem to take pleasure in watching you stagger under these loads, and wouldn't think of lifting a finger to help. Their lives are perpetual fashion shows, embroidered prayer shawls one day and flowery prayers the next. They love to sit at the head table at church dinners, basking in the most prominent positions, preening in the radiance of public flattery, receiving honorary degrees, and getting called 'Doctor' and 'Reverend.'       "Don't let people do that to you, put you on a pedestal like that. You all have a single Teacher, and you are all classmates. Don't set people up as experts over your life, letting them tell you what to do. Save that authority for God; let him tell you what to do.

A very gud source from Saudi has told us that a day or two back shias who have some stupid jalsa near the green dome protested to enter the Baqi at night when it is not allowed. then they screamed ya hayder ,ya hayder & went near the rawdah screaming when the workers stopped them to scream near the rawdah as it is forbidden to do so they literally stabbed & beat up a Saudi man from  call & guidance center ( amr bil maroof) by the time he reached the hospital he was dead. What is the aim of the Shias? In  their own country Iran sunnies are not allowed to practice properly then in Medina they want to create Fitnah & problems like they have done in Iraq & else where. Why can't they live in peace & let others live in peace. I think the Saudi gov should stop all their silly activities. Then when they are not allowed they call them wahabies & they try to  take simpathy from the world that they were forbidden & the Saudies are like this & that. They are such trouble makers.   Trust me this is from a very reliable source & I'm not lying you can ask anyone on here who is from Saudi if that had happened.

20090225084832AAPoFPQ	Society & Culture;Community Service	Volunteering Nightmare (potentially)- How to handle a perv?	A few years ago I worked for an attorney who was constantly sexually harassing me.  This man was twice my age, married, and he would constantly send me text message telling me how lonely he was and how pretty I was and asking me what I was doing each night.  I complained about it to my other coworkers, and long story short, I was forced to leave my position.  Things didn't end well and I was so upset that I started seeing a therapist.      Fast-forward 18 months and I'm in a new job and volunteer with three animal rights organizations.  I was overjoyed when one organization that works to expose Puppy Mills asked me to do some volunteer paralegal work for them.  But last night I found out the attorney with whom I would be working is none other than this perv that I used to work for.      I emailed an old coworker and she said that he probably won't handle it well.  In fact, she says that he has gotten worse and was recently suspended from our local country club for sexually harrassing a groundskeeper.      What should I do?  Should I be the bigger person and put our past behind us for the animals?  Should I do the paralegal work anonymously?  I could really use advice from both men and women.

Those supporting Proposition 8 have been attacked. A Minnesota professor desecrated the Eucharist. A Las Vegas police officer was denied the right to wear a beard or yarmulke. A student was threatened with expulsion for reading the dictionary definition of marriage and two bible verses in California. The professor said, “Ask God What Your Grade Is.” A Muslim woman was denied service at a bank for wearing a hijab. A teacher in Canada attempted to silence the pro-life speech of a 12 year old-student. These incidents are very disturbing. Will religion someday be outlawed?

Last night I went to a concert celebrating black history month and 95% were all white and while the performer was talking about black struggles, the white people were looking around bewildered...they had no clue what he was talking about! Some were really disrepsectful and were laughing! And the minute I walked in people looked at me like I wasnt supposed to be there!

20090128110230AAjS8qj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, does sacrificial love mean that a relationship will never end?	As Christians, we must love our peers and families and friends sacrificially, putting their needs above ours. But in context of a male-female relationship, doesn't this kind of unconditional 100-0(giving 100% expecting 0 in return) love mean that the relationship will never end. Because if one side is at fault, the other side theoretically will continue to love regardless. So when does a relationship end, keeping in mind the 100-0 love concept?

20090128100749AAIWTOp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is God pretending like he does not exist to the faithless people? ?	I mean,  in our natural realm here,  the only way to know God is by having faith because God has separated himself( This pronoun is appropriate because God became a man in Christ.) from our natural realm here.  And by that separation,  without faith,    it can seem like God does not exist,  depending upon how you think about things.

Most people seem to associate Jinn as evil or mischievous/malicious. In my experience when I was younger, 5 yrs old I think, a Jinn came to me introducing herself as a megatron angel of heaven and a Jinn, told me she was sent by God as my guardian angel. she protected me from the people whom tried to harm me, she protected and guarded me even from death! She told me: “I could never let you fall, for in your salvation lies mine! For if you fall, I fall with you! We are the same my love for we have both felt ashamed, guilty, and damned, for things which we neither had control over nor desired. If you fall then all my hopes and dreams fall with you my love!” I have always trusted her, and felt protected by her! she has always been there in the shadows of my life guiding me along my most difficult journeys. I see her all the time in her full form, even though texts say she should be invisible. I once asked her why and how that was possible she told me that for most to see her that their times on this world were short, that she was an angel of death of sorts, executing God's will. I asked her again why I could see her and if my time was short, she responded and told that I was her charge, that she loved me! I don't entirely know how or what to make of my experiences with her only that I know my life would have been far worse/shorter without her. I often refer to her as my guardian angel, and respect her as such! have other people had or have similar experiences with Jinn??

Being that I have not been allowed to keep in contact with any of my family for the last 27 years, It is one thing to not be notified of births, deaths or family news.

20090128114920AAT9sjV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do you think it would be easier for parents to accept their child was born gay?	if they expressed their confusion and desires at an earlier age?       The reason I ask this is that my daughter told me at age 5 that she wanted to marry her female teacher. I told her that she wasn't suppose to because God wants her to marry a man. ( I just figured it was her age) Then at 10 letters were found where she was talking to some other girl at camp that she thought she might have feelings for the same sex. Then when she came out at 14, it was still hard but I think I came to terms with it faster because I had a heads up. I also researched the alternate explanation for certain homosexual Bible Passages and am secure in knowing that my daughter is loved by God. Anyway, I feel I am more secure in KNOWING she was born this way because I was aware of her feelings from a young age.       Do you think it would be better or worse to come out early in order to get the parents to really KNOW that their children were born this way rather than coming out as an adult after their parents had no idea?      NOTE: I will not debate if a child is born this way. If you do not agree that a child is born this way... DO NOT ANSWER. I will not hesitate to report posts that do not answer the question I am posing.

20090128144444AAH0xb2	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Transsexuality and wicca?	Having been born in the wrong body (I consider myself a woman, including the surgery and hormonal correction) I've often faced mean judgement of prejudiced people. However one of the people who had always been kind and warm to me is a Wicca. She worships the female goddess who she calls Dianisis (I assume that is Diana, I can say with certainty it's not Dionysus). By finding great peace with myself with her goddess as source I started to read up and practise some of the wiccan beliefs and ethics which she had followed for a long time.      However, having read up in the past months I found Diana to be linked to the Dianic Wicca. They seemingly do not accept those born in the wrong body, even if those (like me) live as a woman fulltime. Needless to say I was hurt. If my many words and asking for blessings to friends were in vain as the Dianic Wicca branch makes me believe, then I feel raped. All the people who I said a blessing for (both alive and passed away), all the good deeds and things I said for the goddess, they'd be in vain too. I doubt my friend knew this fact, it's not in her personality to support such. Although I hope this will not damage the friendship between her and me being we are like sisters.      My question is if there are non-dianic Wicca branches which also worship the same goddess. I have never had comfort to worship a masculine/male god and do wish to continue worshipping a goddess for that reason. I wonder what options are left for me and which branches focus on goddess-worship while still welcoming me. I feel hurt by the many angry and insulting words spoken by some Dianic Wiccans but I do not wish to let go of all the beautiful ethics, goodness and principles I have learned from my friend and living as a wicca.      Thank you and blessings for any who have an answer. This is a kind request to not bash me for my past. I did not choose how I was born. Thank you again.      Signed,      A very confused and hurt wiccan.      (I put this post on purpose in the LGBT board, wanting to avoid many angry replies in the spirituality & religion area).

20090128133111AAGyQta	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Rock the Devil's music?	I read today that several Christian fundamentalist groups (many associated with Bob Jones University) believe that music of any kind (even Christian Rock) is devilry due to its beat. "Rock's rhythm and beat induce rebellion and anger in the breasts of young people." The beat is also said to throw off the body's perfect sacred rhythm. As this is the first time I've heard of a ruling against music I wondered about the public's perception of banning such music and the opinion of those who belong to such fundamentalist churches. I was born in the mid-80s so I haven't encountered those that feel this way in popular media, though I'm guessing it was a much more discussed topic during the 60s and 70s.        If you do not belong to such a church, please express your opinion of this ruling and if you belong to such a church, please explain more as I find this very interesting.           http://www.tstg.org/modules.php?name=New...           http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20i...

20090128114652AA9fYGj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people still believe that Noah's flood happened?	The Chaldean Flood Tablets from the city of Ur in what is now Southern Iraq, describe how the Bablylonian God Ea had decided to eliminate humans and other land animals with a great flood which was to become "the end of all flesh". He selected Ut-Napishtim, to build an ark to save a few humans, and samples of other animals.    The Babylonian text "The Epic of Galgamesh" 1,8 and the Hebrew story are essentially identical with about 20 major points in common. Their texts are obviously linked in some way. Either:   Genesis was copied from an earlier Babylonian story.   The Galgamesh myth was copied from an earlier Hebrew story, or   Both were copied from a common source that predates them both.    In both the Genesis and Galgamesh stories:   The Genesis story describes how mankind had become obnoxious to God; they were hopelessly sinful and wicked. In the Babylonian story, they were too numerous and noisy.          The Gods (or God)  decided to send a worldwide flood. This would drown men, women, children, babies and infants, as well as eliminate all of the land animals and birds.    The Gods (or God) knew of one righteous man, Ut-Napishtim or Noah.   The Gods (or God) ordered the hero to build a multi-story wooden ark (called a chest or box in the original Hebrew).   The ark would be sealed with pitch.    The ark would have with many internal compartments   It would have a single door    It would have at least one window.   The ark was built and loaded with the hero, a few other humans, and samples from all species of other land animals.    A great rain covered the land with water.   The mountains were initially covered with water.    The ark landed on a mountain in the Middle East.    The hero sent out birds at regular intervals to find if any dry land was in the vicinity.    The first two birds returned to the ark. The third bird apparently found dry land because it did not return.   The hero and his family left the ark, ritually killed an animal, offered it as a sacrifice.   God (or the Gods in the Epic of Gilgamesh) smelled the roasted meat of the sacrifice.   The hero was blessed.    The Babylonian gods seemed genuinely sorry for the genocide that they had created. The God of Noah appears to have regretted his actions as well, because he promised never to do it again.    The were a number of differences between the two stories:   Noah received his instructions directly from Jehovah; Ut-Napishtim received them indirectly during a dream.   Noah's ark was 3 stories high and rectangular in shape. Two estimated dimensions are 547 x 91 ft. and 450 x 75 ft. The Babylonian ark was 6 stories high and square.   Ut-Napishtim invited additional people on board: a pilot and some skilled workmen.   Noah's ark landed on Mt. Ararat; Ut-Napishtim'sat on Mt. Nisir; these locations are both in the Middle East, and are located few hundred miles apart    In the Bible, some of the water emerged from beneath the earth. And the rains from above lasted for 40 days and nights. A 40 day interval often symbolized a period of judgment in the Hebrew Scriptures. 2 In the Babylonian account, the water came only in the form of rain, and lasted only 6 days.    Noah released a raven once and a dove twice; Ut-Napishtim released three birds: a dove, swallow and raven.

20090128140413AAZgbVH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholic Catechism and Homosexuality, an interesting read?	While checking my email and doing my standard news browsing I came across a rather interesting find.  As a former Catholic, having going to our catechism classes, it's fascinating for me to see these things laid out like this.        As stated in the Catholic Catechism:          "2358 The number of men & women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. They do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfil God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition."              "2333 Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity. Physical, moral and spiritual difference and complementarity are orientated toward the goods of marriage and the flourishing of family life."              2211 The political community has a duty to honour the family, to assist it, and to ensure especially:          * the freedom to establish a family, have children and bring them up in keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions;       * the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of the family;       * the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on and raise one's children in it, with the necessary means and institutions..."              "1935 The equality of men rests essentially on their dignity as persons and the rights that flow from it: Every form of social or cultural discrimination in fundamental personal rights on the grounds of sex, race, colour, social conditions, language or religion, must be curbed and eradicated as incompatible with God's design."              "1938 There exist also sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and women. These are in open contradiction of the Gospel: Their equal dignity as persons demands that we strive for fairer and more humane conditions... "          For those who devoutly strive to eradicate the homosexual menace, I ask you - if the fundamental teachings of the Catholic church state these things, how can hateful efforts and discrimination continue?
20090128133632AA21yeo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: Are you either religeous or spiritual?	I understand "atheism" be not just the lack of belief in god(s), but the positive affirmation of the nonexistence of god(s).       I see "religion" as a set of beliefs regarding the nature of existence and morality that give meaning to one's existence whether these beliefs are personal or communal.      Spirituality as I understand it deals with matters of the spirit, the unseen or intangible as opposed to the physical or mundane.      Within those definitions, do you consider yourself to be either religious or spiritual? I know this is a more difficult question, but if so, could you briefly try to describe your religion (set of beliefs) and/or spirituality?

If so how? Do you think it will be one or all of these causes? Biological war? Nuclear war? poverty? Religion? anti-Religion? Natural disaster or global warming?         My thoughts are I think we've thrown our chance to save our self's, out the window. We sacrifice our lives for money and greed. We go about our day wanting more for nothing. Caring about no one but the small group we call family. Humanity was not meant to control the world. We're to self absorbed and destructive. We're going to be our own downfall and I'm terrified of it.

20090128123301AAsxR71	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If Moses and all other Israelite prophets foretold of the Messiah as a prophet besides Isaiah 9:6 then ?	If Moses and all other Israelite prophets foretold of the Messiah as a prophet and prince according to Deuteronomy 18:18, Daniel 7:13-14 and  Ezekiel 43 besides Isaiah 9:6 then can we conclude that Isaiah 9:6 was altered when the Bible was translated into it's English which the translators added the concept of the Messiah becoming God in Isaiah 9:6. The reason I say this is because Isaiah 9:6 is the only verse in the whole Old Testament that refers to the Messiah as a Mighty God. It doesn't even run parallel to the prophecy of the Messiah according to the other prophecies I mentioned above. I have only came to a conclusion that Isaiah 9:6 is altered and that the only correct words in that verse is Prince.

20090128141413AAX1irX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How feasible is it to request your baby be circumsised 8 days after birth, will the hospital allow this?	Are there any mom's out there who circumcised on the 8th day after birth?      When I have another boy I definately want to do it this way especially if I circumcise.      In Genesis 17:12, God specifically directed Abraham to circumcise newborn males on the eighth day. Why the eighth day? In 1935, professor H. Dam proposed the name “vitamin K” for the factor in foods that helped prevent hemorrhaging in baby chicks. We now know vitamin K is responsible for the production (by the liver) of the element known as prothrombin. If vitamin K is deficient, there will be a prothrombin deficiency and hemorrhaging may occur. Oddly, it is only on the fifth through the seventh days of the newborn male’s life that vitamin K (produced by bacteria in the intestinal tract) is present in adequate quantities. Vitamin K, coupled with prothrombin, causes blood coagulation, which is important in any surgical procedure. Holt and McIntosh, in their classic work, Holt Pediatrics, observed that a newborn infant has “peculiar susceptibility to bleeding between the second and fifth days of life.... Hemorrhages at this time, though often inconsequential, are sometimes extensive; they may produce serious damage to internal organs, especially to the brain, and cause death from shock and exsanguination” (1953, pp. 125-126). Obviously, then, if vitamin K is not produced in sufficient quantities until days five through seven, it would be wise to postpone any surgery until some time after that. But why did God specify day eight?      On the eighth day, the amount of prothrombin present actually is elevated above one-hundred percent of normal—and is the only day in the male’s life in which this will be the case under normal conditions. If surgery is to be performed, day eight is the perfect day to do it. Vitamin K and prothrombin levels are at their peak. The chart below, patterned after one published by S.I. McMillen, M.D., in his book, None of These Diseases, portrays this in graphic form.                  Dr. McMillen observed:          We should commend the many hundreds of workers who labored at great expense over a number of years to discover that the safest day to perform circumcision is the eighth. Yet, as we congratulate medical science for this recent finding, we can almost hear the leaves of the Bible rustling. They would like to remind us that four thousand years ago, when God initiated circumcision with Abraham....      Abraham did not pick the eighth day after many centuries of trial-and-error experiments. Neither he nor any of his company from the ancient city of Ur in the Chaldees ever had been circumcised. It was a day picked by the Creator of vitamin K (1984, p. 93).         Moses’ information, as recorded in Genesis 17:12, not only was scientifically accurate, but was years ahead of its time. How did Moses have access to such information? The answer, of course, is provided by the apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 3:16—“Every scripture is inspired of God.”    http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles...

Is this the word of God? Did God tell Paul to ask Timothy to fetch his cloak?       If your answer is no, then does that mean that not everything in the Bible is the word of God? If so, and if some parts are and some aren't according to your beliefs, wouldn't it make sense to make that clear in the Bible? Or aren't Bibles shown like that because in that case it's really hard to determine which parts of the epistles are the word of God and which are just mundane messages by the apostles?

Hi, I am 31 one years old and as far back as i can remember i have never been sick, i mean not even a cold or a flew! 5years ago i was on vacation and my curiosity urged me to visit a lady that was telling the tarrot cards anyway after the session ended she opened a box with about 30 energy crystals as she said and told me to move my hand above them amd chose the one that i would feel i am drown onto! I felt heat emanating from one crystal and chosed that one it was an amethyst crystal with a chain! I held it from the chain towards the center of my hand and it started rotating slow in the beginning but then like crazy! This lady told me that i have the gift of healing and that i would lead the people "to the water" i dont know what that meant and she gave me the crystal as a gift! Also my wife says that when i near her or when i touch her head she feels calm (she suffers from migranes) and other people are very open to me and come to discuss personal matters! What i want to ask is do i have the gift of healing ? And how can i develop it!?

20090128151847AAgY3kR	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I need an opinion on this...?	So there's this girl that I go to school with (we're in university), anyways, her locker is beside mine in the change room, that's how we met. We just casually started talking one day, realized we had the same class last term, and kept on talking. Exchanged phone numbers and she was a very nice person to talk to. I thought I'd made a new friend. So this term roles around, new classes and all, we have another one together. Anyways, we decide to help eachother out, if one misses notes, the other one will give notes. So I type my notes and so does she, and one day my mac just crashed and I lost about 5 pages of typed notes. I was choked! so i asked her for the notes and she said okay. This was our last class before the weekend. I was expecting the notes that night so that I could study them. But I got no notes. When I messaged her on facebook and then on text by phone, she never answered. Finally, a week later she comes up with the excuse "I've been busy, I'm having surgery in a few months and I'm getting all the partying out of my system". That's fine and all, but emailing fukking notes takes 2 minutes, especially when you have them typed which SHE DOES. So I told her, just email them, it's simple. She goes "but you have a mac, that won't work" and i said "it's on compatability format, macs can read anything." So the stupid broad FINALLY sends them after 2 weeks! Then, she said "so I really suck at taking notes, do you think we can swap notes so that we both have 2 sets?" and at first I reluctantly agree'd. I take amazing notes, almost word for word of what the prof says, and on top of that I understand 100% what the course is about, It's native studies, my minor, I have an A+ average, why would I need another set of notes? So i sent her a text saying, u know I don't think we can trade notes anymore, it's not fair to me because I take good notes and you don't. I know when someone is taking advantage of me. So it's now been another week and no reply, no I'm sorry, no nothing. And i stupidly thought we were friends. Does it sound like she was trying to take advantage of me? How can some girls be so stupid and mean? Why do some people try to take advantage of others? I mean I'd be okay if she had apologized and said, "that's not what I meant to do, I'm sorry". That's fine, but don't try to use me then ignore me when I catch on. That's just rude.

Then they start calling white people racist names, but because it's a black people doing the racist jokes, nobody cares.      Why is it like this? I'm not racist against blacks, but what I'm sick of is our culture being ok with black people saying things like that, but if we say anything about a black person, you'll get beat up and left for dead.
