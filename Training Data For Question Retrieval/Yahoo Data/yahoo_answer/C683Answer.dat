ldDRRF9iaa	I would go put on a sexy outfit. Wait until the game is over and he comes to you. Then be like... oh shoot, can you wait another hour?|`|9W2PsQ4kaa	My husband doesn't watch sports, but, if he's watching the news or something on history channel and I was offering sex, he might ask me to wait a couple of minutes til a commercial.  I also have to wait because he has to use the bathroom.  I wait, and I have no problem with that.  He makes it worth the wait.<br>  <br>  However, it's usually ME that asks HIM to wait because I'm usually watching a show.  He waits, because he has no choice.  And I make the wait worth it.<br>  <br>  We usually touch and rub eachother while we wait, which makes the wait not wasted.|`|umGi6gTcaa	lol I'd be insulted. Did he turned to you after 5 minutes and say "I'm ready"? Cause I would of told him "Later now I'm busy." or depending on my mood I would have said "F that. I'll be in the bedroom__ if you need me." or  "You know the saying, if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself."|`|ABMy3boIaa	I would stop haveing sex with him for a while. <br>  <br>  or start initiating sex then say "weit Opra's on, have to go watch that, you can weit cant you" lol|`|MNaT8eKCaa	damn!!<br>  i wouldnt say that to any girl!  how old is him?<br>  may be he needed to take viagra and he didnt want you too see him taking it!|`|AA10250756	I would tell him to let me know when he is ready. No big deal|`|bRoSGSxLaa	id be mad|`|6ubbsPGEaa	Foolish man......that's why God gave us TIVO.........|`|l4Vgc2Dqaa	go start pleasuring urself and if he want to help out or join tell him he cant that wil make him think 2wice oh and when ur done go up to him and go i just wannted u to wait 5 mins ...granted if ur fun fun time lasted more than that say i just wanted u to wait 5 mins ..sorry i didnt mean go over that time i just got carried away with myself|`|EIu7wS1daa	I'd try harder.  Obviously you aren't doing a very good JOB if the tv is still more important.|`|rEW1lEFqaa	HE IS ALLOWING THOU PRIVATE TIME FOR FOREPLAY. THANK HIM.|`|sr7jX2wYaa	Immediate reaction would be  to get P.O.'d , but after a few minutes, I would realize  how many times I have said  similar stuff, when doing something, or  not in the mood , or just plain tired. & know , That is really such a small issue, when you think of the  relationship as  a whole*|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	With my man, that means he won't be getting any.  Turn the tables and walk around the house naked.  Get him to the point where he has to have you and tell him you have a headache.|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	Wait 5 minutes. When guys are focused, they are very focused. Let him finish what he's doing.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	lol.... you learn to live with it.<br>  <br>  what i usually do is take off and do my own thing.  don't worry, just remember... what goes around comes around.|`|Hbxsq22daa	gaw... that sucks.   well when he feels ready to have sex i would just say "Oh never mind, i didn't need you after all i did it myself"  lol jk id say something like no im tired...|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	I'd say screw him, and go get a vibrator.
Ob9ksKYPaa	If you flirt with your guys friends they'll probably tell your boyfriend (behind closed doors) that you're skanky. Don't flirt with his friends, it will make you look bad. <br>  <br>  Just be nice, sweet, and talk to them. If you're nice to them they'll probably like you better and want you more. I mean you're already pretty and young what more could they want?|`|0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	if i was in my thirties i would think that the sexual 19 year old was manipulative.  that is the kind of girl that i would **** and then leave.<br>  <br>  your boyfriend will not feel like he has the best girlfriend in the world by you being an attention-whore and his friends wanting you.  if i was in my thirties i would think that you were insecure.<br>  <br>  i think that you are thinking that guys' minds work the same way as girls' minds.  guys don't give a **** how many other people want a girl.  if he wants her, he wants her.<br>  <br>  you sound extremely insecure and incapable of a real relationship based on love, mutual respect, and trust (honestly).<br>  <br>  what guys want is a girl who treats him well with a lot of love and affection, but also doesn't let him step on her and has high self-respect.|`|95e500b0e9714ee9ecdcd3bba8e4be2eaa	If you do that you will be dumped immediately!!!!  Portraying yourself as a sex toy isn't cute at all, you'll be thought to the guys as a pass her up girl.  Treating this guy nicely will let him know he has the best girlfriend.|`|fA9JQzszaa	They may want you, but ur boyfriend will consider you a slut. It won't help, but it may work.|`|d6xgpLkdaa	Are you sure you're 19 and not 9!!! Thats little kids game.|`|I2YUzjQ8aa	Dont do that as it would only show your immaturity. Jealousy is a primitive baby emotion that little infants feel. Why would you even wanna make his friends jealous if they are even dumb enough to get jealous? If my friend was dating a hot young girl i would be happy for both of them if they found love if i was his true friend.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	that sort of flirting might be seen as a manipulation, a form of deception, which might get you kicked to the curb, cute or not.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	You wanted only older men to respond, but I guess you'll have to deal with an older woman too.  What do you think jealousy is about?  Jealousy is another word for insecurity.  If you flirt with your boyfriend's friends, you are trying to make HIM jealous, not his friends.  If you want your boyfriend to think he has the best girlfriend, that's about how you treat him, how you show him you care about him.  Trying to get his friends to lust after you sounds like an attempt to damage his friendships and to make your boyfriend and his buddies see you as a tramp.  What kind of game are you playing?<br>  <br>  I'm curious.... are you 19 and your boyfriend in his 30s?|`|wu2g3BtRaa	if you flirt with your boyfriend's friends, he's not going to think he has the best girlfriend in the world... believe me.  <br>  <br>  it sounds as though youre trying to "self satisfy".  do you really need their attention?  or is it that he doesn't pay attention to you when youre with him and his friends and it's  your boyfriend that you want to make jealous... <br>  <br>  stop and think.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Don't bother. they already see right through you.|`|pqSGMukvaa	ummm...be satisfied being his girl...dont make other guys like u...especially his friends...tht will only leave u and him in chaos later on...
EsnFmcMFaa	u shouldnt be ashamed but u shouldnt be proud to show ur mom off and tell everyone she is sexy<br>  <br>  if i was you i would keep my mouth shut|`|fA9JQzszaa	First of all, lucky her. Second of all, it's all right (means you have a chance of lookin good in ur forties). Just don't get horny off your mom, then it's wrong.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	that's a question only you can answer...|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	Sounds like you wanna bang your mom dude.|`|7EwBLOAjaa	Okay gross. You called your mom sexy and said she had sex appeal. I have seen guys with pretty moms and they never talk about them in that way. <br>  <br>  It is okay, but the thong thing is kind of our of ordinary. It is okay to be pretty, but I think she should act her age. (No offense intended promise)|`|95e500b0e9714ee9ecdcd3bba8e4be2eaa	You shouldn't be ashamed of your moms sexiness but your mom should repect you and herself at that age around your friends.|`|lUbT6womaa	Um she's your mom. I wouldn't be ashamed, but I wouldn't want to be 'showing her off' either.|`|O0DGKObkaa	well good for her, and you...i think|`|gzE6IeZqaa	2 words: Oedipus Complex. look it up. get some help.|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	Pimpin' your mom out, not so much.|`|prtKFgxWaa	why would i care?|`|FnNn2zXMaa	ok i understand if u give thumbs down but ur mom sounds like a milf soz|`|AA11148143	If she weren't sexy you wouldn't be here.|`|IVy35SE2aa	I think you are lucky.  I had a friend whose mom was that way.<br>  She liked his friends and started dating one.  They were together<br>  a long time.
KbhXg2u6aa	no. Normally a guy ***** a girl and leave. Gives some excuse to go away or passes some lame comment like "we should do this again sometime". he is probably genuine. Persue it! especially if the sex was good :p|`|kllE6Qgkaa	I would have told you anything you wanted to hear to get back to sex, or set it up for next time. And I like to hold girls/ cuddle them at night even if Im not that into them. Thats how fornication goes. Tell a guy your not going to have sex with him. Then dont until you get married... or atleast for a few months... then see if he is still around.|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	Oh heck yes lol. With the love of my life (who i have never dated) after sex he holds me all night, kissing my shoulder and asks how my day was. and sweet stuff like that. But we arnt meant for eachother. and its just another lay for both of us.. But we do have a certain.. chemistry i guess.. that makes it okay.|`|wuovu6h8aa	In my experience, everyone gets mushy during sex.  And everyone is just another lay if you're not married.<br>  <br>  Perhaps he liked sex with you all those years ago, and still does.|`|mrjRPHzTaa	well if you stopped during sex and didn't finish then yes he could tell you anything. If he's still mushy afterward then i would say he is genuine.|`|ZDI7UL9Eaa	Guys say that crap when they want to get laid. Had ya'll already had sex when he said it it would have most likely been true, but, given the circumstances, i wouldn't trust him|`|AA10478165	You answered your own question.You stopped him before he could orgasm.He would have told you anything! I will repeat you can't believe anything a guy says when he is having sex! Nothing!|`|AA11481603	Guys will say anything to get sex and if you stopped him in the middle of sex, he was HIGHLY motivated to be sweet.|`|oanCYN4faa	i think he meant what he said...but just don't fully put ur guard down just yet. keep hanging out with him without any sex or anything sexual and if he still sticks around then you have a good guy. put him to the test. good luck :)|`|QUoMxIIpaa	i wish i had  a girlfriend (siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?|`|xS48nPqraa	well most guys if they just wanted to hit it and quit it wouldnt prolly be like that unless their is something else their wanting too. sounds too me like you might of just found you a good guy.|`|pQ0sLWXaaa	thats a stupid question to ask on here. people are jus gonna give u crap answers|`|e0B3Vcmnaa	he's being nice with you so he can get in your underwear......... are maybe he still likes you.... what do you think? do what your guts is telling you... good luck,|`|3UlGItEEaa	We all want to believe that we are special. Guys know this. <br>  <br>  <br>  He might have really been happy to be with you, but in all honesty its common for a guy to get cuddly after sex now. In this society a lot of things have become O.K.<br>  <br>  Take it at face value for now. When he shows other signs that he cares, then you can say his actions speak louder than words...|`|a1pmr73vaa	Not really..Most guys get mushy when they do mean it.When they use you they get out of bed and shower and tell you to go home.<br>  <br>  Been used..So I know.Give him a shot ..maybe you are misjudging him.|`|RAOrCnonaa	I'd say you should slow things down a little now. If you haven't seen him in so many years then it's time to get to know him again. Don't make any assumptions from a rushed sexual experience. Of course you shouldn't just trust him right out of the blue but that doesn't mean you should automatically assume he just wanted sex either.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	No typically.  But take things slowly.  It sounds like he was trying to recapture that "first kiss" feeling from 10 years ago, but by doing something more than kissing.  You have the right to slow things down and work on that trust first.  Best wishes!|`|qL3dGTXDaa	wow. he was scrambling to save himself from your rejection so of course he would say all that stuff. Maybe you ought to get to know him a bit more before another close encounter.|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	My boyfriend did, but.. that was only the first time we had sex. He doesn't do that anymore.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Go with your instinct!  If you don't trust him than you can't trust that he isn't just trying to play your sweet tooth.  <br>  <br>  Doesn't sound like a bad guy, but not your knight in shining armor, either. <br>  <br>  Don't let the fear of him thinking you're cold make you do something you might regret later!|`|eqEae97raa	This guy sounds genuine and most guys don't get all mushy unless they really cared about you....mine gets like that when we have the time for that....some times we're both on the go and.....????<br>  <br>  Give him another chance and don't be so cold.....he's in love....don't shoot him down.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PfXuyIT1aa	Yes some do, it depends on the guy, for some it's their M.O. and so they keep the lines open for another lay. For others no, it's them being genuine, only time will tell, if all he ever wants is to have sex you know what the answer is!|`|FbTqb3uUaa	He wanted to get in your pants and was playing with your emotions so that you would give in.|`|a9gar0xNaa	Men will say anything...don't trust him.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	No|`|xTSIMhMdaa	It takes time girl .Just wait for the right moment !|`|iY2dzHysaa	I don't think so.
b5d518c3279a26934525aadf51fa388aaa	No don't cut it. Long hair is so sexy.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	Yes, yes, yes.|`|Wwry0QIlaa	YES|`|MYQg4GQ5aa	well its totally your choice and it depeends what you preffer if you think that your hair is something that might impact on a girl liking you or something then i would say definetley yes cut it right this second ! :)|`|SOR9WXiSaa	Well, I would never go out with a guy with a ponytail. That's just my honest opinion :S|`|ZYz60wF6aa	yes|`|kPfyoHAJaa	nononononono<br>  <br>  get style<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  just below ears, longish fringe, not too long<br>  <br>  and just style it<br>  <br>  ask the hairdresser for a good cut<br>  <br>  'emo' styled hair is HOT<br>  <br>  :)|`|vI5CpyRyaa	yes please do!<br>  sorry but ponytails remind me too much of a girl.<br>  not that you look like a girl or anything.<br>  but i like the shaggy hair look on a guy;)<br>  never bald though.|`|xGeWDp21aa	I think that some girls might find it attractive yet others may think it inhygenic. I personally think that you should.|`|fTnXsL1Iaa	NO!! Long hair = amazing!!!
u3I9I8ataa	Yes to a certain extent.  There are always going to be problems in relationships.  Most people take the easy way out instead of finding help.  Love isnt easy.  Its alot of work to keep it alive.|`|flTZBIZnaa	No.That kind of unconditional love is reserved for children and even then sometimes that is not the case.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	No, I think the love between spouses is a choice. <br>  <br>  I really only think unconditional love applies to children.|`|vFCva8R5aa	Absolutely NOT<br>  <br>  MY love definitely has conditions: I will not tolerate someone who abuses me , cheats on me or someone who is addicted to narcotics.|`|aaIhPr6Caa	ummm i dont know... i would say no. <br>  your child.. yes.<br>  but a lover? doubt it. <br>  if the one u loved cheated on you, killed someone, physically hurt someone or you..could you or would you still LOVE them?!<br>  Most likely your love would fade... so it wouldnt be unconditional love would it?|`|gsS0c3yVaa	Nope, nope, nope, nope. Did i say nope???|`|AA10373401	you must be a teenager.|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. If my husband started to beat me or cheat on me...no.
52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Whoever is home does the house stuff.<br>  <br>  That IS their job, man or woman.|`|0bqTHTnDaa	He should be voluntarily helping around the house as well as looking for work.  Maybe you should mention to him how happy it would make you if he was to do a little around the house to help you.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	The reality is that it needs to be done.<br>  <br>  Whoever is on hand, man or woman, takes up the yoke.<br>  <br>  Really, people spend too much time bickering about gender roles.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Typically, both man and woman, husband and wife, mother and father work.  If you all are at a point where you live together, and you support him, who's worrying about being rude?  I bet he leaves the door open when he uses the bathroom.  Tell him to wipe up the toilet and when he's done with that he can do the laundry.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It is not unfair to expect him to take care of the house if he is not working. My husband would do it. When his hours are less than mine he does. He does not consider it rude and I did not have to ask, it is his responsibility also. Good luck to him finding a job.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	The role today is whatever goes.  There is no set role for any marriage.  It all depends upon the circumstances and the people involved.|`|wRbyGQnqaa	It doesn't hurt for the man to help around the house too. It shouldn't be an insult unless it's more of a dispute that he HAS to stay at home and do all the cooking and cleaning, etc. If you guys are negotiating this and he's up for it. It shouldn't be an insult. The world is changing to be more of a dual income anyways, what you're doing is how it's going to be like soon.|`|AA10373401	In the 21st century, whoever makes less money has to be the one to stay home when situation arises that requires 1 parent to home. it does not matter if the husband has to be the one to stay home.|`|Ba4kSf1naa	The role today is that women have to be bread winners and caregivers we dont stop working fulltime especially if we have kids.|`|8zAEQaSFaa	If he is currently unemployed then I think it is totally fair that he does take the role of keeping the house and cooking the dinner. At the end of the day you are the one out there paying the bills so he needs to do his part. When he does find a Job depending on if you split the bills 50/50 30/70 I do think the Man of the house still needs to help out abit. My partner pays most of the bills etc and he is still happy to help out when he can. Because he does pay more bills then i do, I do a lot more around the house then he does and we both have a full time Job. You are totally in your right to get him to help you out abit.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I was not freaked out, but I did not particularly enjoy the experience when we did it.  We tried it a few times, but that was years ago.  It just didn't do enough for us to keep doing it.

Only one person participates--the other is dead as a log because they can't do anything except verbally.<br>  Try it if you trust the person completely, but not if you don't trust them completely.<br>  It's really not all that --as just about anything other than straight up sex is just more ado about nothing.|`|oEG4bkmfaa	I'd be shocked, usually I have to BEG to get tied up.
2uZivThaaa	That might be a little bit difficult because if you back out on him on V-day it might really hurt his feelings. What I would do is casually go out with him maybe even bring along a couple of friends? So its less awkward. Try going to a not so romantic place like... Applebees or The Outback lol. But if you absolutely have to back out "get sick" a 1-2 days before v-day so its not so obvious!|`|AA11774591	I'd plan to do something with my family and then explain how I forgot to mention it. I'd actually do something with my family on that whole day. <br>  Maybe visit a relative with health problems or play sick.|`|QiBJhGNdaa	I wouldn't  back out if you dont have any other plans!!Just talk with himn and make sure he knows its just as friends nothing more.

Not in a romanticaly way, but a more casual bestfriends forever date. <br>  then simply tell him...<br>  i don't want to lead you on thinking other wise. i love you as my bestfriend, ......<br>  (then here you tell him what you think of him as being your best friend)<br>  how it makes you happy. and stuff. <br>  <br>  <br>  &<br>  DONT LIE TO HIM.  :]|`|kA6TaBOkaa	I would personally make up a good excuse such as you promised your mom&dad you would babysit, while they spend valentines together.. of if you have no siblings.. a neighbour.

m85emlXyaa	First of all, if you both don't know what's going on and you have to come to Yahoo answers about it you both aren't ready for sex. Second, she's sixteen-- she isn't ready. Don't risk both of your lives just because you want to act like every other animal and hump each other. Not only are there great emotional and physical complications when you have sex too early, there is ALWAYS the risk of getting pregnant. Yes, even if you use birth control and a condom (and God, I hope you are.) Getting pregnant will ruin your lives, I promise.<br>  <br>  Now, this is very common among girls who are just starting out with sex (and sometimes women who are experienced). If the vaginal fluid is slightly pink from blood it is resulting from small tearing from sexual exhaustion. Anything else should definitely be checked out by a gynecologist. If she's having sex, she needs to go see one anyway.<br>  <br>  I would advise that you both hold off on the sex. She is too young to risk ruining her life just for a little fun. You seem mature enough to understand that, now take some responsibility. Since you seem older than she is, you really need to be a man and not take advantage of a young girl.|`|erhdsNHHaa	<a href="http://www.thesite.org/sexandrelationships/askthesiteqandas/sexualhealthqandas/bloodconfusion" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesite.org/sexandrelationshi...</a><br>  <br>  This should help clear things up!<br>  I wouldn't be too worried but I think she should see a doctor.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	uhh =/ good luck<br>  i guess u went too deep and na i dont think she is hidin anything|`|e28P8gWraa	Well it sounds like her last bf had a small dick and the fact that you were on top in missionary thrusting in (the position for the deepest penetration) its most likely you did pop her cherry. But you could of been doing it to hard. Or if she was off her period only a day or so before it could be left over blood, that happens some times.|`|dx9AZ16Paa	well she isnt a virgin so her cherry is already poped.<br>  maybe you was going to hard and it made it bleed.<br>  it is possiable.<br>  i would go to a clinic and tell yr doctor and see what he says.|`|iAhCtXFIaa	you popped the cherry, you were probably bigger than the past guys shes done it withhhh shes not hiding anything lol|`|XUBHpH2paa	ask her if her cherry has already been popped, cuz a girl's cherry is not always popped her first time. so if u ask her n she says no, chances are u popped it.|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	go ask a specialist.|`|W05piyBxaa	TMI|`|zdr2M7vUaa	AIDS XD|`|dvLqREZcaa	yes it happens. quit worrying like a girl.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Well, it's possible to tear the vaginal skin during intercourse, but that shouldn't produce a lot of blood.<br>  <br>  An infection could, though.  If she has PID or herpes, even dysplasia (often caused by HPV), those could all lead to heavier bleeding.<br>  <br>  If she told you whe went to the doctor and got a clean bill of health in one visit, she lied.  Those tests need to be sent off.<br>  <br>  You should have worn a condom, and every time.  You should also make an appointment with your doctor to get the tests.  Sounds to me like she's got something funky going on up there.<br>  <br>  (Because if she really had been sexually active in the past, her "cherry" would already be popped.)|`|tPolDnwlaa	Simple answer.  The hard thrusting caused friction on her cervix and caused her to bleed.  Don't freak out and assume she has something and no you didn't "pop her cherry"... just be a little easier next time.  And PLEASE use a condom!  She's 16... she doesn't need to get pregnant and you want to protect yourself and her from STD's.|`|M97UAK0haa	yeah its normal, i bled a few times w/ my ex boyfriend so i went to the doctors. they thought it could of been herpes being irritated, but i got checked and was good, thank god. but the doctor said everything was finee, & that maybe he was just real big.<br>  <br>  idk get checked & have her do it tooo<br>  <br>  <br>  good luckk|`|vAJafujuaa	I don't think you popped her cherry. You just thrust too hard probably. If you're too rough, girls can bleed. Especially if you had her on top of you. Her body weight would have added to the impact of the thrust.|`|3H9k7tN5aa	Perhaps hiding that she WAS a virgin? Or like someone said, the guy before you was kinda of small. By the sounds of it you possibly just broke her in. Perhaps she was a virgin.|`|kR0eVoTmaa	That happen to girls sometimes so yeah it mostly happen i even sometimes seen that happen because yeah that just happen.|`|9Ed7cgAFaa	I'd bet on period blood. The hymen isn't that deep.|`|CNFRrWhIaa	Where is the male figure in your life ?you didn't pop her cherry ,too deep|`|EgRt4LMfaa	sounds normal--u can rip places in there|`|i7XkKqhgaa	ok. well when a girl has sex for the first time her hymen doesnt always break (the thing that bleads when u first have sex, its a thin layer of skin) it has holes in it and is very stretchy so maybe it didnt break when she first had sex. maybe u just broke it then. i cant see what else it could be. hope i was helpful|`|uNlbvD5vaa	Call ask a nurse, tell them what happened and they might have some answers for you.  If it wasn't her period, it could be a lot of different things.<br>  Were you there when she was having sex before you?  Maybe she is secretly a Virgin. If you two are close as you say why wont she talk about it? The Hymen (cherry) is not that far back..  It could have been a cyst. Did you personally see her test results? If it were my body and all things you say are true, I would be going in for fear of something serious. Start there, then have yourself checked just in case, it can't hurt to be sure. I would keep it to myself as far as going though, not to hurt her feelings.  She also could be scared to go to a dr. Does she have an OBGYN? If not do you have a Planned Parent Hood where you are from?  Or anything offered for girls for obgyn matters?  Good Luck!|`|wu2g3BtRaa	becasue you were thrusting hard you could have torn her a bit and she started bleeding. i wouldn't worry about it.  but you should always wear condoms... there are many diseases out there and there is also the question of pregnancy.  always, always, always wear a condom -- put it this way, anyone she has slept with you are now sleeping with and visa versa.  just be careful hun; you'll be fine.|`|oAyI70W5aa	you went in deep...<br>  haha<br>  <br>  answermineplease<3<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090202210544AA0CDrm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Going deep will not make a girl bleed.. and you're right, someone else has already popped her cherry.. so what's she talking about... could it be that she has some infections or even stds?
7e4jxj3Daa	We'll survive without it, but it's always better when we orgasm.|`|rurfFLDkaa	uhmm..yea thats bad. you cant shake up the V8 for nothin|`|vja4ddNmaa	It has happened to me before, and I went home high-strung, tense, and feeling pain in my genitalia, besides having an erection that wouldn't stop until late morning.<br>  <br>  In other words, no.|`|TfzzhYUXaa	1... You can't stop.<br>  <br>  2....Why would you not want one?<br>  <br>  <br>  3.....Men get off a lot easier then girls. Get use to it.<br>  <br>  <br>  4...... YOU CAN'T STOP.........OR YOU'RE  A MAJOR B^TCH!!!!<br>         I hate when a guy stops|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	He will keep going until he does|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	Blue Balls|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	It's not bad to have an orgasm.  If he's having an orgasm and you're satisfied is should not be a problem.<br>  <br>  Also, he may not actually be having an orgasm.  Ejaculation and orgasm are two different things but they usually happen so closely in men that they are thought to be one.|`|mCoipTkbaa	guys will always have the orgasms and its also needed to make a baby, on the other hand a womens orgasm isnt really needed to get pregnant...<br>  <br>  most women dont care if they dont orgasm, because satisfaction is more to us than just that...<br>  guys have to orgasm to be satisfied..we dont..|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Well..<br>  <br>  normally if a guy does not ejaculate during sex, he will get what is called "Blue Balls".. It can be VERY painful.<br>  <br>  So it is good to make sure he finishes.|`|GqTSa85daa	That's mostly his reason for wanting sex. Pleasing you is secondary.|`|0VBESmFQaa	See guys need to have an orgasm just so they don't murder people,That's all it really is|`|VMAhim63aa	sometimes afterwards his balls will reaaalllly hurt (blue balls)|`|KncPJwIaaa	Ive had it happen every so often to me and i don't get that upset about it|`|Ve48V97Baa	because it's rather easy..and to be honest... how hard can it be for girls?|`|AyP3KlKdaa	No matter what he tells you, it doesn't hurt or isn't bad if a guy doesn't come.  The thing is, that it's so easy for a guy that why not.  If fact, you could make him come even if he didn't want to.  But he always wants to, it's the way we're wired.  And if you stop part way, it drives him crazy.|`|X4hJRncvaa	from a guys point of view there is no point in starting if youre not gonna  finish... unless youre teasing on purpose, which is sometimes fun but it more often sucks.<br>  <br>  if he isnt pleasing you, let him know. if he cant- get a new guy.<br>  <br>  overall ide say finish what you start. even if its a few hours later, its torture if your girl is teasing you all day... at the end make him happy<br>  <br>  no- it is not bad, if he needs to he can do it himself...|`|n4N35Cugaa	yes to ur question and for urself, if u always hv to fake orgasm thats bad for u....... explore ways of how both of u can enjoy the moment, u know like share with him wat u like or dislike him to do.... wat ure doing now is like taking revenge for the times u didnt come.. <br>  <br>  dont fake it... if he's not good at it tell him to his face....|`|JV8HfDb4aa	That will definitely result in "blue balls."  If a guy gets that close to orgasm and it doesn't happen, he'll prob end up takin' care of it himself.  It is uncomfortable to be that aroused without relief...All this said...it won't be the end of the world for him or you...it's not "really bad" for him.  He just won't be happy bout it|`|s6BzNXRfaa	Just means your not giving him what he needs, or just not long enough.|`|bYFS7xBCaa	No , even if he doesn't have it, he will do it while you are still setting there.|`|0VfHTdCSaa	guys dont have any fun unless they orgasm. girls still have fun...
X7wlv6Xkaa	Some guys are more extreme than others, but naturally they all are. I think women of this age seem to see more of the bad habits than they do the good ones. It looks to me that despite all these bad *** things he does to you, by some miracle you seem to allow him to keep doing it to you. So you have obviously accepted that fact and it becomes part of the relationship. But that does not mean its healthy because it seems like a one sided affair, where you're the one deeply in love and he's just with you for monetary security. If you can't leave the man despite all that, I suggest you learn how to accept his ways but make him see that it is bad and making you suffer in turn and find a way to make him pay for the wrong he does - I don't mean violence. Maybe make him work for what you give him by taking care of the kids.|`|333648a40b57c0c7b0a26b7b121beb0eaa	It's hard to say if it's just you, because (since you're the one asking) most of the examples you gave logically support your point of view. I'm sure there are other times when this person is at least somewhat more reasonable, if not about money then certainly about other things.<br>  <br>  That being said, it does indeed sound like he is selfish --maybe selfish is the wrong word, but he definately has an irresponsible view of money. (Maybe he comes from a background where money was looked at in a different way?) <br>  You should sit down and talk to him, recognizing that maybe neither one of you is WRONG, per se, but that the current situation just isn't working in a compatible way, and that the both of you really need to come up with a better way of dealing with finances. <br>  If you can't agree on a solution, you should definately consider more drastic solutions before something that may be annoying becomes a very serious situation you may have trouble getting out of.|`|RV5EsIp1aa	its prolly because you're a black woman and have a real bad attitude...he's prolly scared of you--<br>  <br>  You sound like your overexaggeratiing things a bit....<br>  <br>  get over yourself, I'm sure he can find a better woman, you sound mean and rude...I feel sorry for him...<br>  <br>  tell him to call me, I'll take care of him!|`|YxiCcUkDaa	Sorry time to get away from that situation it only will get worse not better.  Do something for you and your kids and let him think for awhile and see if he comes around and sees how selfish he is.|`|o2tPN5Geaa	If you really need people to answer that question for you then you are just as bad as he is.  Open your eyes Chickie!!!|`|mk8Z8xElaa	This situation is a hard one. I think he is being a dick, but you have to make the final decision.|`|DD8bQxaYaa	Talk to him, don't do anything major before you attempt to sort it out.|`|gELUbPnAaa	its not you, he's a DICK..he needs to grow up and realize what his priorities are.|`|XkWlLXbkaa	He won't change.  Dump him now!|`|kDCm8q9Zaa	dont buy him any food.|`|1GpOdlsYaa	leave him|`|oHENw1AXaa	he is a gold digger. <br>  <br>  drop him like last month's shoes hun!|`|KmnHehkcaa	What a tacky bastard.<br>  Leave him now! <br>  You dont deserve that, sweetie.|`|AA10961677	A dick, I'm not so sure....but he is definitely a guy who does not know how to manage his money!!!|`|HHyny0JSaa	Girl.... that is one selfish greedy MF. If that dirt bike was more important to him than the the roof over you and your childrens heads..... Next time he asks for a hundred, give him 20 and tell him to make it last. But for real you need to talk to him and make him realize that when you have a family, that comes first before our wants and sometimes needs. And you need to budget. And I don't think a dirt bike falls into one of those catergories. It's not selfish of you at all. Unless he is taking the money you give him and using it for things your family needs, which is doesn't sound like, then you are being fair in saying that he's being a dick.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Well don't go to him leave him alone.|`|qHUcyrytaa	Sounds like he is selfish and controlling. You need to talk to him and tell him how you feel.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Run. This is only the beginning!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	He's a DICK|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Yep... he's a dick<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|cG80UU5Waa	He bought a dirt bike instead of paying rent on the place where his children live?<br>  <br>  If that's so, he's a scumbag. Whatever money you have, make sure he doesn't have access to it--you've got your kids to think about. If you have a joint bank account open your own so that at the very least you know you have money set aside so that you don't get throw out your home. If he asks for money, tell him NO, and explain what that money is needed for (ie kids need school clothes, groceries, rent, etc) <br>  <br>  If he's the kind of husband/boyfriend and father that spends money on a dirt bike instead or rent, why are you even with him? If he hasn't bothered to marry you, sue him for child support.|`|UUx74K5Caa	Seems you know the answer.  Selfish and immature.  There are plenty of fish in the sea so why don't you throw this one back.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	he's so selfish! i would talk to him about it or leave him. if there are kids involved, confront him. if that doesn't work, i suggest getting professional help.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Why are you still with him ? I can see why he needs you but I can't see why you need him..He sounds like a spoiled mamas boy.. get a good lawyer !!|`|qHnSIwvgaa	If your not lieing, then yeah it does sound a bit unfair.|`|DJLz6o8Iaa	hes dont deserve you|`|MOALoKWdaa	leave his assssssss|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	if you can't figure this out your self theres a problem
hDAoKmjPaa	sweetie i would say move on and find a new guy. if he wants to play games let him play but dont be there for him to play them with you. just move on and find yourself a nice sexy guy who doesnt want to play games lol!!!|`|eTxk4lSxaa	He sounds distracted and luke warm about you. If it were me, I would go ahead and enjoy my life without wasting more energy trying to decipher his mixed messages. If that means another guy all well and good. Chances are,  if you back off and show him you are an independent woman who isn't interested in games, you will appeal more and he will make up his mind whether to pursue you or not|`|Eo4P2s3yaa	This guys sucks. Move on.|`|8DhXfDXUaa	dump his booty not worth it|`|bkgBLjuvaa	move on. there alot more guys out there not just him.?|`|wu2g3BtRaa	he could be going through something  but at the same time you probably want to date and enjoy the company of someone special.  if i were you i'd just relax and let things happen as they happen.  don't push him but don't push anyone else away either.  if someone asks you for a date and you like him, just go and enjoy yourself.  there's no reason for you to keep all your eggs in one basket if you know what i mean. have fun... youre young... enjoy it.|`|MouJoCo3aa	Hmmmm, I would definitely try making him chase you before/if you move on. For example: make him talk to you first. Act like you don't care; trust me it's tough.. I've done it before. It drives guys nuts when girls are chasing them, that's when they do it.

c5UAa65qaa	I don't think it's her you want: it's who she was in high school, and the hopes you had for your future in those days.  You don't know who she's become since she graduated and married her husband - and whether you're aware of it or not, you've changed, too.  Even if she were free, you wouldn't be able to get back exactly what you had together back then, so there's no point in dwelling on it.

cewWPIzIaa	Looks alone are not enough to make me want to date someone.  As far as the other things, it depends:<br>  <br>  *  Cigarette smoking - it doesn't really bother me, but I would prefer to date a non-smoker.  <br>  *  Smoking weed (or any other illegal drugs)- deal breaker for me<br>  *  Getting drunk often - another deal breaker (I was married to an alcoholic - never again)<br>  * Slept with a lot of slutty people - not a deal breaker, but a turn-off.  They would have to be tested and clean of course.<br>  *  Has been to jail - depends on the offense and whether they really have reformed<br>  *  No high school diploma - doesn't matter as long as they are intelligent and at least have a GED.<br>  *  Doesn't drive - not a huge deal unless they lost their license due to drunk driving (see "getting drunk often")<br>  <br>  I believe people can change if they really want to, but the person you describe would have to do a lot more changing before I'd be willing to give them a chance.|`|hmNY4gQtaa	no<br>  <br>  irresponsible is spelled all over that behaviour, don't want that in my life|`|oDgWQQkxaa	As Ark said, " not a F***ing chance."|`|8Z7Rl860aa	Hm...this is a tough one. :/<br>  <br>  NO.|`|r6rcCTKHaa	nope. not into the weed and sluts.|`|xu6pxXslaa	uhh thats a no|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Uuuuhhhh.....no.<br>  <br>  But it seems like you go for looks since thats the first thing you told us, so i doubt you care what we have to say.<br>  I mean are u listening to urself?<br>   He smokes but he says he wants to quit?

Do visit and get it for your fantastic way to attract guys.|`|vlEeaB4baa	Sit back and be quiet while you watch all the other girls act like idiots trying hard to be fake so he'll notice them.  Guys like mysterious girls,,,, not loud and crazy, but shy and quiet   :)|`|wu2g3BtRaa	hot off the presses from a friend on IM... the best way to get a guy's attention:  eye contact and smile.  good luck hun.|`|ksjtZ0J5aa	Take off your top, yes and also dress sexily? Offer me sex, no?|`|oclvWDzPaa	wen u lift one leg higher than the other|`|Wuypu9J9aa	first you gotta get their attention, either just "accidentally" bump into the guy or try to catch him looking at you and give him a really cute and sexy smile. When that happens, talk to your friends and other guys, and while your doing that, look and smile at him every now and then and let him watch you, let him know your having a good time and act as if your playing hard to get.<br>  They're start coming to you. I do that all the time and it works every time. Just remember eye contact, smile, fun, and flirty.<br>  Don't be so trashy and don't put out. The decent guys like classy girls. Guys who straight up tells you to take your top off or just goes right in to get some are obviously douche bags and you don't want to waste your time with them.<br>  Just go with the flow.|`|mbn1PmdBaa	Give him your best smile, and when he looks at you give him a flirty look, then slowly turn away.<br>  Go to some other guy and just smile at them, but make sure he's watching.<br>  Then he's gunna think he's not that good enough for you.<br>  Then if he still looks at you, go to him and talk to him.<br>  Guys love it when girls have the guts to go talk to them.|`|ZN2dmoEnaa	Just look at him alot and act shy when he sees you, but smile at him and act embarassed. That's a dead give away that a girl likes a guy.|`|va3Ysr8vaa	Im a guy and we like shy but very confident women, women who smile and don't go crazy out of there way to get a man|`|k3t9dzciaa	You should wave and say hey, wink. or look interested.|`|JbdNFTj0aa	Take off your top, that would work!|`|ZJg26cAmaa	wtf bite their lips? id be like need chapstick?<br>  <br>  <br>  be flirty ;]

XgankRhEaa	Get yourself out there. Your the guy, ask girls out on dates. Don't stand around and think that girls are going to ask you out because its the guys part to go get the girls. The girls are waiting for the guys to ask them. And it just feels weird and embarrasing when the girls have to ask the guy but we do when we have to like for dances. So it's your job to not be single. Go to every social thing you can. Your looks are great. Just try to be open with the girls. I know it hard but thats what we have to do. And even if your not having a good time on the date make sure your date always has a great time. Good luck!|`|mqd1WmSVaa	U are handsome.  You will find someone when that person comes along.  Its not a bad thing that u havent found the right girl yet.  It just shows that ur a good guy who dosent want to rush :]
nIBTKNe7aa	met off the computer or off the bar what difference does it make<br>  you know what i find weird? moving in with a stranger<br>  "move in with some one u hardly know"<br>  she didnt say just met him off the internet she said 'met him off the internet'<br>  let's all pay attention to the language please|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	yeah its creepy, how r u going to move in with some one u hardly know. they could be SCO, and it seems a little bit desperate.|`|jTLjaDxxaa	it is odd in a way you should get to no the person really well first . i met my hubby on line and every thing worked out well for us|`|r6rcCTKHaa	i agree.<br>  thats creepy...|`|RvFwmQOPaa	Why is it weird? Its just like meeting a person in the store or a club and getting to know them and then starting a relationship. We're all strangers in the beginning. No matter where or how you meet a person, as long as you take the time to get to know them and you feel comfortable with them, then taking the relationship to another level is common. How many people out there actually knew everything about their mate before they moved in with them. You don't really get to know a person until you've lived with them. You find out all of their habits, good and bad. Computers are necessary in today's society and for busy professionals that don't have time to meet people out. That's the reason why online dating is so popular. Of course you have to be safe and meet in person to really find out if the person is real and upfront.|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	you mean from the internet! get to know him 1st.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	don't people usually meet and get to know each other first and wait a bit before they move in together.........????  Yeah it would be weird and strange if you met someone online and the next day moved in together............|`|oChms6KJaa	Ya, it would rather just find someone in person, but what ever floats your boat.|`|dV1cbuZ6aa	yeah does sound odd  . . they could be a totally different person in reality!|`|ofEb1uRLaa	I agree with you all the way.
AA11853507	Hahaha you are a cute one lol...Well i don' really force him...i mean if i ask my bf something and he does it i know that somewhere in him he wanted it too, you know what i mean ;)..I don't use it for materialistic stuff though.<br>  Sooo Most of the time i do "try" the puppy dog eyes and that usually works for me lol.<br>  But i got to admit the girls got the power :p<br>  Take care.|`|AA12006919	Funny that you know it and do it. :)<br>  That's the way love goes: she will blink and you will do whatever she wants, and even more!!!<br>  <br>  And that's how it should be.<br>  U r wrapped around her finger and you will be wrapped even more..... and don't worry about it cause this is the absolute normal way of things!<br>  ;-)

kwaYWYzSaa	Dont' have that child! Your only 17 and you can't support yourself. Think about having to pay all of those extra bills. It will be a nightmare. I say don't have that child until your are at least married and have a decent job to support your offspring.|`|BPqK0c5taa	Your way to young to think about having kids. How can you raise a kid when your in school. Is he going to a stay at home Dad. I would recommend waiting until you have some kind of life plan. No way can you have life figured out at 17. You can have some idea on how you want your life to go. But a lot of things can change a long the way.<br>  <br>  I agree it would be pretty sweet to have a kid, someone you can take care of, give advise to. But I'm only 19 can't say I am thinking of kids although my girlfriend and I went through a pregnancy scare recently.|`|uXU90Tutaa	trust meee!!!! you have your whole life ahead of you if you have a kid right now i promise you will never have a ful filled life as you wished tell him if he really cares about you than he will wait untell you are ready.... don't waste your life just yet..good luck!!!!|`|eBoH1liEaa	NO. You're too young and you more than likely still won't be together once you get older. Be smart, and not dumb. Having a kid is more than you think.|`|kVbWYt1Waa	get married first....... maybe get a pet together that'll comsume his time so he won't be thinking about a child......it'll be a good experince for you two too. GOOD LUCK|`|PLtU5AuYaa	You are a liar if you cant figure out the OBVIOUS answer to this.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	i think you'd be a fool to have a baby now.  if you both have scholarships to Howard you should most definitely go!  But first pay attention to grammar... and together isn't 2gether... you've got to get out of texting mode.|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	Don't!  You are not ready for a child.  An education is the most important right now.  You will not make it through school working to take care of an infant.  And why does he want a child? Status!  Do his friends have children? If they do what are they doing to care for those children? Do they pay support?  Oh, and he would have to pay support unless you get married and how is he going to do that.  And this is a growing time for both of you.  Things may change.  You may both decide to go in different directions and who will be left to care for that baby?  Go to school and if he still is around after wards, then go the full nine yards if that is what you want.|`|MgMsMExPaa	God please do not bring a child into the picture.Neither of you will sleep then the grades start to fall off . Maybe if you were in Mensa and had a full time nanny . What if your pregnancy was difficult and you had to withdraw for a semester to deliver the baby. Plus where is the money going to come from to take care of this child financially. If  the two of you are full time students this is a terrible move.|`|MQaIP3Fzaa	if you're not old enough to know how to spell "DOES" then you're not old enough to have a kid. try going to college first. get an education. see if you two make it through "howard" together and then maybe be engaged for a year. i hate it when all these innocent kids are born just because stupid teens couldn't wait a couple years to have a kid. i don't care if you have sex, just don't bring another kid into this world while you yourself are still a kid. you can't give that baby the life it deserves yet, you both are not financially/mentally ready for a baby.<br>  why in the world does a 17 year old guy want to have a baby?! <br>  seriously.|`|inBsYE8Raa	Are you both sure that your  ready to raise a family? In the family code<br>  your age is considered as minor. Why didn't you wait until you got mar-<br>  ried before deciding to sleep with him. You have lots of people to meet<br>  aside from him.When it comes to "love" better use first your head rather than your heart and emotions.

Every waking moment all we did was try to make the other smile.. We would take walks, share dreams, watch movies, shop(girls like that), cook together, stay up all night talking then watch the sun come up. Our first date we went out to eat and then sat in the parking lot all night talking..I love her so much, she really is my soulmate, and she is always on my mind and in my heart.. I won't get into the sad part of this story but l will just say l honestly believe that there is one person out ther that was made for you and you have to find that person and hold on tight.. never let go..|`|dfa773ff05a09dc59722ea7ba4efa11aaa	We clicked right away, talked and talked..First date to the movies..One thing we always did for fun was just go for booze cruises, ride around and have a few beers, then most of the time go parking :) To this day we are in our late 40's and we still booze cruise and we still go parking, its alot more fun now! Thats just one of the things we still do..  Great Question!|`|972546c068cad91ccd54a080c2fcc41caa	We were FRIENDS first.  I think the communication/talking was what attracted us to each other.  We could tell each other anything.  First date was to a Girls regional basketball tournament.  For fun, we would go bowling, go to the movies and even play pool.    We don't play pool any more, but we do the other things.  We've been married now 22 years.

Some women like it in the mouth more than in their vagina or their A** so it is all a matter of preference.  There are three was to get it for females. the mouth, the Vagina or the A** which ever they like they will do some do one, some do two and some do all three, and some do it with three partners all at once.|`|db70e4ab7f2dcdeab940ba2429cb0786aa	Depends on the woman.

They are people like everyone else that have an opinion and they just have a larger group to express it.  I am guessing that the article you read was a bit biased.  Not all men are dogs and players just like all women are not out to get married, settle down, and have children.|`|9ab264c1b22ecf7e7fb80a5555272515aa	I see it more among women in person than I do in the media.  I think the media still puts the shame on women with the way they portray the female characters in what is becoming nearly every TV show and movie.  There are more and more shows about women fighting to "win over" a man, and characters portraying desparate women trying to be noticed.  It's the women dressed in the next-to-nothing lingerie and the topless/nude women being used to market new movie releases.  ALTHOUGH A REAL MAN DOESN'T USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO DEGRADE WOMEN, I don't think we can only blame this on men.  I think that the women who play these parts should have enough self-respect and respect for other women to put their foot down.  If these women wouldn't agree to let it happen, it wouldn't happen.  The only way it will stop is at the source.  So as far as media goes, I don't see it.  However, when you come across a conversation between women, I have to say I hear it more.  I guess it's finally catching up with the old "Women are whores...men are heros" idea.  Not saying it's right.  I believe it's come as a result of women being put down and held back for so long.  Womens' rights movements are getting stronger and stronger, and voices are coming out.  They're just not coming out in a very productive way.  Rather than "rising above" and moving forward, many have chosen to stoop down to where the rival men have been for so long.  Men and women alike have been labeled in distasteful ways, and it really has hurt a lot of families, children, and relationships.  Rather than being taught to communicate and have respect for other people, children are growing up with these "I don't need no man/woman" attitudes.  They leave no room for compromise in relationships.  It's their way or no way.  There are a lot of people (MEN AND WOMEN) who seems to think that because their life is anything other than perfect, everyone around them owes them something.  Perhaps if people made an effort to do for themselves rather than expecting everyone else to hand it all to them, the world wouldn't be so focused on how sorry a man or woman is.  They'd be able to focus on how much people are able to have/accomplish for themselves, rather than blaming someone else for what they haven't been able to have/accomplish.  Everyone deserves common courtesey and a certain amount of respect.  On the other hand, beyond the certain amount of respect, respect also should be earned.  Strong, friendly, confident (not arrogant) people earn respect...nor do they allow people to make them feel like any less than what they are.  If you truly are a good person and someone doesn't treat you with respect, simply turn and walk away.|`|AA10528834	Personally I see more men bashing from women than the media. <br>  Women seem to think it's ok to ***** about EVERYTHING a man does and the way he does it because it's not up to OUR expectations...but let a man make some of the same statements and he is nothing but a PIG! <br>  <br>  Hey, if men can put up with PMS and being bashed by their loving wife then I think they deserve a damn medal!

Just hope he is understand, but you have to make sure that you can explain yourself so he knows what you are trying to tell him.|`|58e42e4f28635bc7f03a028586380d4baa	how can you date someone without ever exchanging numbers? how do you set up dates then?

Too me its nasty and shows lack of respect.|`|eea298b14d7ed11df21077e3c41eb745aa	Sounds like you never got over the fiance - must have been some number she's done on you. It's too bad; there some nice girls out there but you probably can't even see them since you're dismissing them all as cold, heartless cheaters. Don't feel like you're the only one on the planet who can be monogamous. I know more committed people than cheaters myself. Maybe you outta change where you live or perhaps just your social network. You really have a bumb outlook on relationships and I don't think the people you're around are helping any.<br>  <br>  By the way, it works both ways as far as labelling goes. Gone are the days where just the women are wearing the scarlet letter. Everybody needs to take responsibility for their actions.|`|hBJqTkxBaa	Women are not doing it so they can beat you to the punch, we figure what the hell im unhappy ...why  not?

(Still do, actually...) Ask her mom what her favorite flower is (stay away from her bff because she's sure to tell your girl) or get her a few carnations in her favorite color. Write her a poem or burn her a cd with her favite songs. She'll love it.|`|8db22f4f5c1745720777eb0169be70b2aa	14 huh? When I was 14 I probably would have like a mixed tape...haha..so i guess you could make her a cd with love songs or songs that are special to your relationship. Flowers are always good...especially at 14 since she probably hasnt receive flowers from guys in her life. I got ballons tied to a stuffed animal when I was in high school. I had never gotten balloons before so it was nice. You can get a bunch and not spend much money. If you have a picture of the two of you you could put it in a nice frame. If there is an ice skating rink near you you could take her ice skating. Write her a poem--that always gets me--just the effort is good, even if you arent a good writer. Or a letter telling her how you feel about her. <br>  <br>  If none of those ideas work for you just think about what she really likes and go from there.|`|AA12109294	a gift card to her favorite store...

Cheating on wife bad idea, If you get caught off with your nuts. And if she leaves you she is gonna go after everything. Now having a relationship with married women is fun. No commitment and time is limited. Plus you can still sleep with others and its not cheating. But if husband finds out he may kill you, or leave her and then your stuck with a cheating whore.

I had a good buddy, and we always teased each other about it, and I thought that he was with my wife, and his wife thought that he was with my wife, and we started cheating together.  He got drunk one night and he said that his wife talks to me more than him, plus she was always mentioning my name.  We broke up as friends.<br>  There was another time that I was going out with another friends wife while they was separated, and he found out about it.  He got mad at first but now we have been friends, we talk about it, laugh about it, now for about 17 years.  He tells me that he was jealous of me as his friend at one time, but now he says that it does not bother him and sometimes we all go out together and eat breakfast and dance.<br>  If a person has never been there, then they cannot honestly answer your question.

Still, I think that's the only barrier, that and the fact that your object of desire might have a gf/bf waiting in the wings.  Hmmm... maybe not though, but your person does have a partner... hmmm...still, if you want to think you might have a chance, It would be through talking like you're doing and getting close that way and then letting the other person realize that there is a huge [physical attraction.

qBd89G7faa	Sounds like you are very insecure. But the good thing is you can work on it. Learn to be confident in yourself! You already have her! No need to be upset unless she is confiding in you about likeing other guys that she hangs out with that she may think are attractive etc then you may have a problem. You don't have to trust her friends just HER. If she has never shown signs of cheating etc then relax a little. No your not a terrible person the issues you have are within you, as long as your not verbally expressing it to her or telling her she can't hug her friends etc then your fine . If you start trying to control her in the sense of picking her friends etc then your just going to chase her off and push her away. Remember just because her friends may do certain things or act a certain way does NOT mean she will be the same way, do not judge her by her friends. Like I said you already have her so just chill :) Good Luck!<br>  T.|`|7d6a43aca7569c092dcf562633195e6aaa	u need to change, u have to start trusting her friends.<br>  <br>  ur not terrible but it'll get in the way of things between u two|`|9f401380993e280c348855babee66e8baa	You're not a terrible person, but you may need to just get over it. In my opinion, you're saying that you don't trust her friends, but I believe that you don't trust her. If you didn't trust her friends, this wouldn't be a serious issue. You sound like you have a possesive personality, but I don't know you, so I am only giving you my opinion.

Anyway if there is love and only love they don't look these things. In the beggining of course....|`|5caf2ee4e2c3b524de2d4f31c17e0084aa	because as we girls have a load of girlfriends, we like a guy who can express his feelings, but we too look at physically appearance. personally intelligence is my thing.|`|AA10108216	What you are saying is incorrect.

856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	“Love   vs.   Attachment”<br>  <br>  What in the world is the difference between loving a person and being attached to them?<br>  Love is the sincere wish for others to be happy, and to be free from suffering.<br>  Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have No ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest, or to fulfill our desires; to love others simply because they exist.<br>  Attachment, on the other hand, exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy, but when we're separated from them, we are often miserable. Attachment is linked with expectations of what others should be or do.<br>  Is love as it is usually understood in our society <br>  really love? or attachment ? or even possibly for some, only selfish lust.<br>  Let us examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes mindfully, and carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. <br>  Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value.<br>  We examine someone's looks, body, education,<br>  financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. <br>  In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, praise us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick or depressed, we consider them good people, and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. <br>  <br>  But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to "us", as if we are the most important person in the world.<br>  After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them.<br>  <br>  Desiring to be with the people a lot who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's -<br>  when we're with these people, we're Up, when we're not with these people, we're Down.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're very disappointed, or may become angry !<br>  We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people.<br>  Our problems arise not because others aren't<br>  who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they<br>  aren't.<br>  Checklist: "I Love You if __________ "<br>  What we call love is most often attachment.<br>  It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person.<br>  We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person.<br>  "Love, on the other hand, is an open and very calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachment is uncontrolled and much too sentimental, Love is direct and powerful. Attachment obscures our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love builds up others, and clarifies our minds, and we <br>  access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachment is based on<br>  selfishness, while Love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond<br>  all the superficial appearances, and dwells on the fact that they are just like us: they want inner peace, happiness, and want to avoid suffering. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our selfish minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean, and talented people. Love, on the other hand, never evaluates others by these superficial standards and looks much deeper into the person. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they seek inner peace, to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. <br>  When we're attached, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to another person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. <br>  This does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately.<br>  If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious, insecure, falling into a depression. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them.<br>  "The core problem is we seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own<br>  minds. 'We can develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many, magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And <br>  then we'll seek to increase true love, without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate patience and understanding, as well as generosity, concentration and wisdom.'<br>  <br>  'Under the influence of attachment we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us, or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying attachment doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachment there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine Affection and Impartial Love for them.<br>  We'll be actively involved with them.<br>  If we learn to subdue our attachments, we can most definitely have successful friendships and personal relationships with others.  These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect - the relationships will be based on. We'll care about the happiness and the misery of all human beings equally, simply because everyone is the same in wanting and needing inner peace, happiness, and not wanting to suffer. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual Love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life.|`|AA10596399	it's called Murphy's law... :S|`|CuVmodRjaa	You haven't met the right person yet.

I have found that trying to change ppl to fast and in ways they can not understand does more harm than good.... You start telling them their wrongs and they will show you just how WRONG YOU are.... sad fact of life is this.. *that until they see the error of their ways in the mirror, talking will do NO good*. ... so just hang in there... keep space between urself and them and just occasionaly remind them , like I said, of who and what you are........

I don't have any advice for you, although I wish that I did. Just don't let them get you down. They'll realize what they're doing eventually. Hopefully, sooner or later they'll understand that you'll always be their sister and they need to quit treating you this way. Good luck to ya.
AA11552202	You dont fancy him but you enjoy him paying you attention...flirt with other boys who you think are cute.|`|12c9c68b505e6a8d148fd97ed59c13bbaa	There Is nothing going on between you <br>  you are makeing HUGE assumptions<br>  Just relax being someones friend is a better way to start a relationship,<br>  if you really wanna know if you like him ask yourself how youd feel if he went out with your best friend.|`|dhUoCddSaa	yeah...you guys had something and it always gonna be still there...but now its awkward and if you want to start something again you have to break the awkwardness. He stares at you , and he probably thinking the same thing that you think when you stare at him. (you know you do :) He could be trying to make you jealous-but it doesn't seem like he wants a relationship...he's the average 15 yr old boy...girls always think more seriously. & it sucks to say but he probebly does this to a lot of girls & they feel the same way. Either take the initiative OR forget him.  Good luck!
hBJqTkxBaa	Show up, dont burden them by staying at their house, Just go, asking is more of an insult|`|4a9d240b60d831f350235d8cd536c863aa	I would ask 1st because you do not know how he feels. Don't jump the gun for your own feelings of showing respect.|`|2Ktd4j0Iaa	DEFINATELY ask first.  You need to be sure he's up for having visitors, especially one who has to fly in.|`|89b714cbdecabab2ad09af6c20fca02baa	Well, if you are expecting to stay at his place, then it's inappropriate.  If you have somewhere else to stay, that's a little better.<br>  <br>  You should get him to suggest you coming out. Call him, talk about his loss, say you have some free time coming up in case he could use the support, that you can't think of a more worthwhile way to spend your time, etc. etc.|`|c7897c6f31b1358c1c8e6c7cf8f85672aa	I think it's ok to show up at the funeral.  You don't need an invitation to go to a funeral.  I wouldn't go to his house before the funeral though.  After the funeral friends and family might gather at his house so it would probably be ok to go to his home at that time if you are invited by him or another family member.|`|fJC9p951aa	I would probably call him up...<br>  <br>  Ask him "I am very sorry about the accident. I am coming down to pay my respects..." and see if saying something like this will initiate a response to whether or not you should come down.
05zXmWe8aa	cuz when you break up with some one they feel mad and embarresed cuz they got dumped...anndd they're pathetic and think being spiteful and sending people after will bring you down but if you completely ignore them and show them they're not getting to you then you'll be fine...unless you still like the guy or girl..then i guess you got problemss|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	because there is a fine line before love and hate. in order to hate strongly you have to of loved powerfully|`|022f85e7f46c742b23f50b39428e73eeaa	scary|`|01915a52512d57c2f3a0b803bda222e0aa	Damn, dude, you got it bad! She actually has some people after you? Damn, this girl wants your balls on a chain or something. I would hate to be you. Well, the question is what did you do to for her to behave that way? Either a-you messed around with her feelings, or b-she's just going psycho on you. Good Luck!|`|AA11156692	because you broke their heart and it's all they can do to stop rom crying every time they hear you name or see you. that and maybe give you a taste of the pain they feel.

Women are #%$@! psycho, remember that.|`|AA11088454	cause they dont want to see you with anyone else,and if they do they get jealous.|`|b6btdhlQaa	Unfortunately hurt people, hurt people. Sometimes they can be spiteful because you hurt them, broke their hearts or more likely their trust. Sometimes, they have been hurt in the past. You can usually see this when your dating them however. Pain is the inner most cause for this type of behavior, although other underlying reasons can also be present. Sometimes they want you back. They do not know how to communicate the painful feelings or the loving emotion that they want to show you. They might not even know what they are feeling. People have forgotten how to love. Not the I love you because we're together or you love me too. But, the love that doesn't depend on a returning emotion. However, this does not by any means excuse their behavior! If they are going to far-REPORT THEM! I have had tires slashed, stalking ex boyfriends hiding in my closet, and it can get extreme. Prank phone calls and cold attitudes are one thing, but do be careful.

bbee94fbdf17ad190005445609bfd7f4aa	ok|`|eH66sxYcaa	read tips on love and relationhsips to help you more on this site|`|cro4SRCmaa	I can definitely relate to this is some aspects.<br>  <br>  Ok first you should talk to him (Do this in person) and tell him how you feel and that you are extremely hurt.  Tell him that you want to try to work things out and that you both need to learn how to agree on certain things.  Say that he doesn't make you feel beautiful and that every girl needs that.  If he seems to ignore it and doesn't change within a few days then the next step is to pretend that you don't care, see if he comes around.  I found this to help with my current relationship.  Go out with your friends, have fun, and don't call him until he calls you.  If he still doesn't come around then you should break up with him because it seems like he is drifting away from you...I mean not to call you and ignore you?  Why would he do that??   Temper can also be a real problem and it seems like he won't change that because he doesn't care.  <br>  <br>  I know how you feel.  Me and my boyfriend used to be perfect but now he doesn't bother anymore with calling, seeing me, or making me feel special.  That's why I am considering moving on.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped :)  And don't worry!  I'm sure you're really pretty!!  If you're silly and don't think you are, try to change your look a little, like for example hair and make up see what works for you because it's a great way to build your self-esteem :)|`|ztsmEg7Waa	You should do what you feel like. You should list our the good and bad things about him. Which ever side has the most things listed down you should go with that one.Take good things as you should not break up and bad things as you should break up.

QZZjXj6gaa	Should you talk pretty much everything? or should you just create some mystery, a positive one? should you not disclose only something that intrests you both and leave it halfway for him to dig more...? conversession is different than reporting and it should be two way and more or less passionate..!

9HoXpsP6aa	I'm really sorry about your brother.  First things first, please don't blame yourself.  Car wrecks happen to good people, and you shouldn't live in guilt.  If it was your choice he would still be here with you, and praying helps me cope and understand, it's having someone who won't judge you listen, and I really sometimes feel as if the world's been lifted off of my shoulders.   <br>  <br>  Now, about the phone calls:  You should get a caller ID, and then call your phone provider and request to block that number once you get it.  They will not be able to call you from that number again, and if you did find out who it was, have your parents call theirs, I"m sure they'd get in huge trouble for being so nasty and disrespectful.  People that matter don't treat you that way, and people that treat you that way don't matter.   Good luck with everything.|`|4YVd6Fp3aa	oh my goodness tell them you do not appreciate them calling block their number call the police. Also let these people know how you feel about your brother maybe it will show these callers you're a person too and you are extremely hurt. I cannot even fathom how much you miss him. It'll be alright if your strong grow from this. I send my prayers.|`|o3xSqMtNaa	Oh my gosh! That is horrible! You should block the number from calling anymore. I'm very sorry for your loss.

THEIR DAY WILL COME! and so will yours to see your brother again :) xx
8bcdcff739f8a8e34a43eb41b55e867caa	mira claro que no lo perdonaria de hecho jamás he perdonado una traición porque exijo lo que se dar, sin embargo no hay que apresurar las cosas, a veces una es la responsable de esas traiciones como? pués no les ponemos la debida atención, osea en el sexo los descuidamos tanto que buscan a otras personas, o dejamos de ser sexis, de la misma manera tu podrías aver sido la que lo hiciera, pero si lo amas linda piensalo, mira mi matrimonio de 6 a?os se trono por un error de esos, el me rogó y yo no supe perdonar, ahi no fue por descuidos mios ya que lo adoraba, y con una hija de por medio, después de 7 a?os me doy cuenta de que un perdon hubiera sido suficiente para retomar mi vida, ahora estoy sin mi hija porque prefirio irse con su padre y sola en otra ciudad.  No sabes que cruel es la vida y solo por ser tan orgullosa|`|Y0pFHfNdaa	no, ya que da?a toda la relacion la confianza, la falta de comunicacion, y aunque lo perdones, viviras desconfiando.

cI7DnCIHaa	It is okay, and even healthy to forgive him, but please do not stay with him.  <br>  While it is possible for people to change, YOU can not be the reason they change.  People can only change for themselves, its the only way it works.  Sorry.<br>  There is never an excuse for knowingly and intentionally hurting your significant other through infidelity.  It was a choice and he chose to do something harmful to you, in complete disregard for your feelings.  He may never cheat again, but such callousness toward you can cause other issues down the road.<br>  Forgiving is not the same thing as forgetting and forgiving does not say that their actions have been accepted.  The bonds of trust aren't easy to mend, so unless you're already married to this guy, you should chalk this one up to experience and move on.|`|5VPpBvuBaa	i don't believe that if someone loves you they would be unfaithful. you could forgive him but whos to say that he won't do it again? i wouldn't forgive him but thats just what i would do, you have to do whats right for you. hope this helps.|`|1gL5S4GZaa	Cheating is usually a character flaw, not always though. My ex was like that, tuthfully he was like that when I met him and i knew it because we were friends for awhile so I saw him doing it. I was stupid enough to believe that it was different with me. I actually married the guy, he never changed and I left because he had far to many other issues and I realized he didn't really love me. But to the point, if what he is telling you is true [ that he loves you ] there will be a real change in him, even before you take him back, if not I would reccomend letting it go. Some people, like my ex, will stay with someone for the security of always having them to fall back on.

8LFkdHn6aa	Yo creo q a la mayoria de las chicas q ahora son madres les pidieron o dijeron Quieres ser mi novia??? Es el toque romantico y  la manera de demostrar el Respeto que se tiene a la novia!!!,ademas q cuando decidias tener este compromiso de amor,fidelidad y respeto era por que estabas segura de lo que querias,claro esta con sus ventajas y desventajas,aunque  siempre habra problemas pero lo interesante es sacar el noviazgo adelante para q con el matrimonio  se vaya afianzando la relacion.NO esta out como dices,los jovenes quieren evitar todo compromiso para poder fregar al projimo,hombres y mujeres tenemos la misma necesidad de ser amados y todas esas cosas q nos ahacen felices o q  nos satisfacen,pero ya lo han tomado a la ligera,las chicas fuera de la casa tomando,teniendo un free solo para  tener relaciones sexuales y ellos dizque muy liberales,ya quisiera q tengan una novia q haya sido la chica mala de la peli aver si se iban a aguantar con tanta "experiencia de ellas" al fin con q ella no les dijera con quien fue su primera vez se compone!,se dice q el hombre q pierde,pero ellas que??? no merecen q alguien las ame y sean todo para alguien,precisamente por eso para pedirle :Quieres ser  mi novia???<br>  No se me pongan locos libertad no es libertinaje, ya me imagino casandose de blanco ellas y ellos ya habiendo estado cuanto "amigo" se hayan encontrado o convencido para un free,y ala hora de la recepcion felicitandolos por su larga experiencia,buscan casarse de blanco por q no solo es pureza del vestido, es la pureza del alma laq se dispone a entregar al esposo.Y pensar q todo es cuestion q las chicas decidan  su tener un free y pasar como si nada a ser su novia o darse su lugar y pedir pero de corazon sea  el compa?ero en el que en algun momento sea tu esposo o padre de tus hijos.Claro mediran que si no tienen novios como veran quien es el indicado,es obvio,pero esto no quieredecir que tengas obligaciones con los muchachos sobretodo las sexuales!!! He dicho..............Bye!!!|`|a59afe292ecb492a32cffc329eb1a236aa	Lo siento... el amor verdadero supera cualquier epoca, frustracion osotonta  o trauma de las personas...|`|c90b3a39701525248b3e1e0a2a6a0b10aa	Tenés problemas existenciales, simples y evidentemente superficiales, esteticos, burdos y pelotudos.<br>  <br>  Solo te digo que no se usa la palabra "novio" o "novia" porque actualmente está en boga que las personas no son propiedad privada o pública de nadie. Gracias al egolatrismo y al individualismo. De todas maneras adhiero a esta manera de pensar. Cada uno vive y sufre su vida, por tanto ya no necesitamos más due?os nefastos, nos sobramos.|`|nPqZMrKHaa	Pues le dije: "Tú me gustas cómo hacemos???" y él me dijo "Buenos vamos a intentarlo" y ya llevamos un buen tiempo de novios|`|CAoAB3fOaa	yo sola la tome en mis fuertes y calurosos brazos, y le dije, nena, quiero estar contigo, y luego la besé, tenemos dos a?os juntos, y de lujo!!!|`|fQBaPvm9aa	eso no es una cuestion de moda o si se usa o no, es otra cosa, es algo que cuando lo sientes lo dices como te venga en ese momento, no tienen que ser precisamente esas palabras pero si en el momento asi lo quieres decir no debes pensarlo mucho porque pierdes el momento, eso no es un cliché, ni algo que tenga que ser muy preparado porque se ve fingido, inseguido y se vuelve en un seguro NO. si la respuesta es si, por lo general se formaliza el inicio de la relacion con un beso.|`|803a9dc193226d442c339b4d52063cadaa	yo ami ni?a hemosha le dije, QUIERES SER MI DULCE NI?A y ella asepto, respecto a tu situacion si quiere algo contigo dile que no son nada para que te toque o te bese  que te respete y asi solamente te pedira que sea su novia, tu tienes el control, ustedes tienen el poder siempre recuerdalo.<br>  <br>  ustedes mandan siempre por eso las amamos ok suerte.|`|eb64271bbda8235322efd08d2824a4c6aa	tu pregunta le da mas peso a la mia.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqdiuhNvDW0UJsC2DsNuY5zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20071103220737AA1LCgy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

The improtant part overall is that your able to make up for the argument. In a relationship, making up for an argument, is one of the improtatnt pecies to gain a good relationship. Although you should Cut down on the arguments.

Maybe you two would be better just hanging out and losing the title b/f and g/f.  Thankfully you're still fairly young and have time to make more serious decisions in the relationship department.  <br>  <br>  I don't care how old you are, men are a lot of women's weaknesses.  LOL A good looking man is one of my weaknesses.  I just love to look at them.  It's always nice to have a good connection w/ somebody, but you shouldn't feel like fighting and arguing are okay in a relationship, if it is happening all the time.  I would explore some other options if I were you.|`|cd3c26ea843f5a029ff94f95530e6de6aa	If you get married, that feeling of looking into his eyes will go away (much like an alcoholic needs more alcohol to feel drunk after a while).  You need to establish a connection apart from looking into their eyes.  Find common ground like your wants in life, your likes, etc.

Rk7Ar4qLaa	Agredd, and i think that guys that have to go that far just to get a girl are pathetic losers.|`|AA12285104	i guess complete DORKS could use it.....but other than that, no i rekon not|`|9f401380993e280c348855babee66e8baa	I agree with you, but the show is really entertaining!|`|Q8IZgvtJaa	ugh i use this lmfao im 16, id like to say im not a pathetic loser.. people dont get self confidence that fast.. its a process. what mystery provides is a method that can help thm out.. which is basically a confidence boost. And another thing Bret Michaels, and Tommy Lee, are in rock bands and are in very very popular bands. I think the money and the fame gave them their self confidence.. But I sure as hell dont think its pathetic. I'd rather guys learn this then fall in love with the first girl he meets, even if shes a *****. Which can lead to drinking problems, and issues. Some guys look to suicide if they cant get girls. Some look to rape, or murder.|`|lYQ60IhCaa	women have become a lot pickier than say the 70's or 80's I think and sometimes if you're just not born with decent looks, you're going to have to win them over with personality.  But what if the problem is you have no personality.  What if you don't have that confidence?  What if you're afraid?  That's what the pick up artist is about.  The guy in the fur coat and hat had that problem.    He gave up his pride and dignity, approached and must've been rejected over 1000 times to FINALLY figure out what women like in men and what's the best way to get their attention and win their hearts.   And now he wants to teach it to men who are in the same shoes he once was.  Sometimes some people just can't change by themselves, what if he has confidence but just can't communicate with women?  There are men out there who get rejected constantly and if he doesn't seek help I don't believe the situation will get better....UNLESS he's willing to go through what the TV host has gone through but i DOUBT it.  Basically, the guy in the fur coat has gone through it all for these guys and...through trial and error, finally figured out what makes women tick...what turns them on.  And why not?  At least women will have someone interesting to talk to at a bar rather than some extremely hot guy who will say all the wrong things and try to get into bed with her.  So why don't you read up on this guy a little before you make snide judgements

And whatever she says after that, you have been mature and calm and sensible about it, tried to make peace and whatever she decides to do, thats her choice. If she gets over it (cos it is not a big deal, at all!!!) and if she doesnt, well ur better without her then arent you. make new friends, start some hobbies, stop worrying and stop valuing yourself based on what other people are doing with each other. You cant be so possesive of your friend, she can hang out with whoever she wants to.

nKvwMCgTaa	I'm a girl so I have some advice for you. It sounds like you might just think these 5 girls are pretty or nice, but you don't really want to be with them. Try to see if you could picture having a relationship with one of the girls, if you don't get that "bubbly, butterflies, happy" feeling in your stomach when you think of that girl, you don't like her.|`|9mHJkCDoaa	that's why you get to know all of them.<br>  and stop admiring from afar.<br>  it's kinda creepy.<br>  grow some balls and go up to them and talk to them.<br>  find the one with the most connection.<br>  (or the biggest boobs. j/k kinda.)|`|c1be009a330b425807037307248fc874aa	You give the male sex a bad name.|`|gCKmYPIuaa	Well see which of the girls are more responsible,and care  more for you.

Get to know them a little bit and flirt a little bit. You'll get attention back from some of them and you won't from others. That's a start. Then of the ones who seem to like you too, figure out who you like most and why, based on how well you get along, how well you flirt, what you have in common, etc. etc.  You don't need to pick on person before you've even started exploring all your options!|`|1PY1tqKdaa	Really it is not your choice to get the girl you want the girl needs to think to.

xUtA5fnPaa	I suggest you start by fingering her a lot. I dont know if you have already tried this or not, but keep at it. This has happened to me before in the past since my penis was too big for the girl and it hurt her pretty bad. I started fingering her before each time so you can loosen up her vagina. Once you do that try to get some lubricant and go in slowly. works like a charm|`|AA10591117	Put it in her vagina, not her nostril|`|gCKmYPIuaa	Try somthing else other then trying to stick your penis in her.

2c8244371ece2e4523b40d2d84fef4b3aa	In general terms .... If a person likes you they will …. <br>  <br>  - stare at you if they can<br>  - smile at you<br>  - try to make conversation with you<br>  - asks questions of you (big indicator)<br>  - tries to be where you are just by coincidence<br>  - faces you directly while talking to you (face to face)<br>  - their body will face you directly at you while talking to you (chest to chest, so to speak)<br>  - has bright, happy eyes when they see you<br>  - stops to make time for you if they are able at the moment <br>  <br>  if the person who likes you is shy, they will want to talk with you and demonstrate these things listed here, but because of fear and inexperience, they will hold back on alot of these indicators.  They will check you out, however ......  they always do that .... <br>  <br>  I spent YEARS being shy, just  like the guy you like .......  it is hard to break out of. If you like him, you need to make it easy for him .....  like buy him a 12-oz Coke or something and just give it to him at lunch time ....... it will blow him away and he will know you like him.  Just keep it up ......  just little things such as this will be monumental to him ... and he will get the point. <br>  <br>  Shy boys are among the safest to be with as they are generally far more considerate of you ... and careful. They usually posses a sense of humility also ... and that is a difficult quality to find in this age group  .... it is a priceless quality, I think.<br>  <br>  it may take a little work on your part .......  but you will most likely  have a better boy friend then most of the other girls you know  ..... <br>  <br>  good luck ....|`|gCKmYPIuaa	You can probably tell if he's made eye contact with you, or maybe if he was eager to help you with anything such as homeword or etc|`|2yb2F87Caa	hey girl! i have the same problem, because shy boys act like they dont like you but they really do, try to catch him staring at you, or you can try being his friend or flirt with him and see if he will open up! i know shy boys are hard!|`|AA12338289	ask him out.|`|uc6zLgf6aa	You know if he is all shy around you.

Slowly move in for the kiss, and as you get to her lips, make it soft, kiss her lips a few times and then if you plan to "french" slowly move your tounge inside her mouth. Dont make a pattern of where your tounge goes, and dont go back & forth and up and down, just slowly in a little and around, you feel it, you'll just know it and how it works...Good luck on that kiss!|`|FMBAleT6aa	1.

Then change the conversation and tell her how beautiful you think she is in a soft and sweet voice. Look at her and tell her she is smart and so very pretty. Then just lean in and kiss her. Just do not make it a quick kiss but one that lasts for 5 to 15 seconds. Put one arm around her back and one hand behind her head and but don't pull her head, just have your hand there kinda supporting her head. Then it should go good from there on. Just remember don't let your hands wonder to much. I mean don't go touching her breasts or inner thigh. You can rub your hand up and down her back and maybe wonder down a little to her butt, but that's it. If she wants anything more you will know by where and how she reacts to you and how she touches you. Remember in that situation she is in control more or less. So just make sure she feels comfortable and safe around you and it will go fine. After the kissing just start whispering sweet things in her ear about how wonderful she is and maybe kiss a little and suck on her ear lobe, and neck. Good luck and don't get to nervous and enjoy being with such a beautiful woman.|`|YhgCq3yZaa	just be yourself....

As hard and hurtful as it is, you deserve better but nothing will dull the pain but it does get easier, I would avoid this boy and try not to talk or reply to his messages, maybe then he'll realise how much he has upset you.

Do you need help with that stick?|`|m8UEGUaGaa	I don't know why you can't understand that he is teaching his daughter how to address her grandmother, uncle and aunt.

He is simply teaching her how "she" should address them.<br>  <br>  If this is the only thing your husband is doing - please feel blessed.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	There's nothing wrong with so-called "baby" names.

Asking why shouldn't lead to hurt feelings.|`|DRKzzw0Haa	Enjoy it. I am 43 and I still address my aunts and uncles that way.

It's an endearing thing to many.|`|chlvKoXqaa	Goodness gracious he should only talk to the child that way, not to you or anyone else, tell him to get a grip.

I am part of a large extended Maori family and we all refer to ourselves as Aunty (name) or Uncle (name). The older generation who are technically uncles or aunties become nan or koro. Older cousins become aunty or uncle to the next generation of babies. It's just a sign of respect in our culture. <br>  Don't start picking on the little stuff this early on in the marriage.<br>  You asked the question you should handle the answers
289ccf15e18e573af11aa60d253dc3bfaa	TRY CALLING HER!|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Why are you asking us? We are not your gf.You need to call her and ask her what is going on so based on her answer look us up and we will judge her for you.|`|AA10248966	Move on. She's done with you. It is ok. There are others.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Simple, shes making you make the first move for whatever reason, probably to blame you for what happened or what might happen. Some women are like that and it sounds like shes one of them. nothing wrong with it but a bit old fashioned. So be the man here and contact her and swallow your pride and apologize whether its your fault or not. Good luck|`|xBd96wvRaa	Is your phone broken? You know the kind of communication where you use your voice to do the talking rather then your fingers.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	How does this pertain to marriage aand divorce???   Dahhhhhh|`|PMcMeduCaa	Well she could be doing a number of things. She could be testing you to see how long you will keep this going for. Or she could just be mad at you and doesn't want to talk to you. She might need some space. Or she found someone else and is thinking about either breaking up with you or deciding if she still really wants to be in a relationship with you. If she doesn't write back to you or say anything to you give her an ultimatum tell her i have been trying to talk to you and you won't respond back either you tell me why your not talking to me and we move on from this or you can find someone else if there's a problem and just leave don't talk to her again b/c obviously she is immature if she can't handle something like this. And if she comes running back then she knows she made a mistake by leaving you. (if she picks to leave). It might hurt to do this but if it's really meant to be with you are her nothing will stand in the way remember that.|`|QZk07VH8aa	ok first of all dont be ubsesive show up with some flowers shw her u love her let her come back to u
a59579ec8aee8902f555d4fccd5299e6aa	You are living in the most beautiful country on Earth, and you feel depressed?  You will never have friends if you are so needy, learn how to be content in yourself to find true peace.  Try and search for other lonely people, and you will solve other peoples loneliness as well as your own.|`|BuJClF3Faa	You can try to be more social, friendly, or wait it out. I've been feeling left out and lonely for quite some time now, but we're moving in a few months. I'm in the same boat as you--two REAL friends. All you really need is one person whom you can be really close to. When they're not at school, find something else to do. Last year, second semester, I had a lunch that none of my friends had. (My two REAL ones or the ones I talk to, but they still ignore me most of the time) I'd eat by myself and then go to the library. Even though I was alone, that lunch was beneficial to me because I discovered my fondness for reading. I read lots of books and got lots of homework done at lunch rather than at home.<br>  <br>  Go out of your way to reach out and be friendly to everyone; to other lonely people or to people who have the entire school except you as their friend. You won't be there forever. Find a way to be happy in yourself. Instead of using the lunch time to mope around and be sad, do something productive. Find a new hobby, read, do your homework. Do SOMETHING with your time instead of being sad. It'll do you a whole world of good.|`|efUGbjI4aa	I'm sorry that things aren't going well right now..  Just keep your head up.  Things will get better, I'm sure.  You won't be there for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Also, people are naturally attracted to happy, carefree people -- not unhappy, depressed people.  Try to loosen up a bit, just smile more.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|F6XVq2Kvaa	go to a diffrent skool. if u really cant stand it that much then switch. i wanna switch outta mine cause the kids here suck. but i cant cause my parent wont let me. but u tottaly should if u dont like it
d45c5ec5ec9b57aa10b92d94f9ed3700aa	talk to her about it first, and ask her what's going on. be blunt, don't dance around it. ask her why she has cuts on her arms. tell her you think she needs to talk to someone about it. whether or not she agrees, you have to get her help. <br>  she may hate you, but you have to tell an adult- a guidance counselor or her parents or your parents. it's going to cause a problem with your friendship for a little because she's going to be upset you told someone but it's for her benefit. she's going to eventually realize what you did was good. it's probably a cry for attention, wanting someone to notice it (it may be her subconsciously doing that, without realizing it though so don't say that to her) <br>  i wish you luck and i hope your friend gets better soon|`|AA10612425	one thing you don't wanna do is talk to a counselor or her mom because in the end it might not help out too much in fact it might make it worse. just talk to her about it. and if she gives you some lame excuse like some cat did it or something similar to that don't fall for it. you need to be direct and honest with her and try to reach out to help her. just be there for her in the best way you can if the situation worsens call 9-1-1 and they will take care of  it from there. she might not like you when you do that but trust me she will thank you later for helping her get back on the right path.|`|ZbLa5lHdaa	DONT talk to a school councelor or her mom.<br>  you'll lose her as a friend i gaurentee it.<br>  cutting became really popular a few years ago when i was in 8th grade..<br>  i know it's messed up but i wouldn't worry too much about it.. a lot more people do it then you think.|`|vjBLkWaPaa	well leave it for a few days, take notice to see if any more injurys apear on her or if it gets worse<br>  if so... talk to her about it<br>  good luck<br>  xx|`|hzxSuapfaa	Talk to her and if she says its nuting then u have 2 talk to her parents or 2 urs and maybe she just needs a friend to talk to u neva no!
A2Ne8sdFaa	go ahead and talk to him. if you don't you'll regret it someday. he probably wants to talk to you too.|`|Kaw0jDPmaa	Talk 2 him!!! if he has a gf then dont interfere let there relationship end but still tlk 2 him dont let ur fears overcum u
OzBHZ64jaa	I'd let her calm down, then I'd try to talk to her-in person- and let her know how hard a choice it was for you. You could also tell her how sad you are that she's mad at you. If that doesn't work, I guess just give her more time and let it sink in. Hope that helps!<br>  (:|`|ZYYRpNcIaa	<i><b> explain the same thing you just wrote down<br>  that this mary girl seemed so excited and you didnt want to hurt her feelings<br>  tell her u really want to b friends and you didnt mean it if u made her upset<br>  if she doesnt listen to u leave it a few more days....hang around with some different people and she will soon miss u !|`|ADpPVwdNaa	Let her cool down, and then talk to her in person. She can't just ignore you like she can when you call/text/email her because you're standing right there with her. That's when you should get this all resolved.
zzUgYFy4aa	i fell in love with my best friend<br>  <br>  we are married now<br>  <br>  i could not be happier
0ycoeVpZaa	I had a friend with benefits. If it doesnt go well, the friendship is basically destroyed. If not i dont c why not. But it doesnt sound like u want something like that, and if u dont, then dont do it.|`|lveC3ArHaa	I think it's kind of gross and a messy situation.  I don't know why you would do it... Maybe if you had a uncontrollably strong sex drive?  But why not find a boyfriend/girlfriend to do that with.|`|gkPJgl7Faa	well its definately something you have to be cojmfortable with dont do anything you dont want to do....if it doesnt feel right just say no<br>  <br>  dont be afraid|`|lsm6CEZSaa	friends with benefits is like.. one person liking the other and the other person not caring anything about the one person, if you get what im saying, it never works out, and it kills you when the other person finally does find someone, cause it felt like yall were dating all along, i don't like the idea of it.<br>  guys always want it.|`|llLodN1Haa	IM WITH YOU.ITS NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR MORE THAN ONE REASON.ONE OF THEM IS THAT IT WILL MOST DEFINITELY CHANGE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND IF YOU ARE TRULY BEST FRIENDS THAN YOU DONT WANT TO DO THAT.
yDVlTUYTaa	I'm a little confused by the question, but yes someone should turn her in and no, not because it's expensive for you to support her. She is cheating our government and she needs to be stopped. That said, I doubt that they will deport her when she has young children that are citizens. You could ask an attorney but I really think all she'll get is a slap on the hand.|`|OhxDofcRaa	Sorry to be mean about this but.......send her back!!! I wish they all would leave and go back where they belong!! They have done nothing for our Country whatsoever except make it rough on the American man that had a job until they came and done it cheaper and knocked out the American man from doing the job and supporting his family!!! And yes ur right not a 1 has licenses and they are getting this stuff illegal and taking jobs away!!!  Deport them all!!!!|`|jwwwIJRHaa	Wow, I am usually the voice of reason, in Answers, but you seem really mean. Are you trying to get out of paying child support? If not, what's it to you how the mother lives her life? Do your part of raising your child, and let her circumstances be her business.<br>  <br>  Now, if you think she is an unfit mother, sue for full guardianship. Otherwise, have a V8, and chill.|`|TOY5CvcJaa	You will gain nothing by hurting other people.
1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	Are you ready to be a full time father and mother?<br>  <br>  If someone stole your car or hurt your child would you the law to take action, would you want them to be punished for their wrong?<br>  <br>  If this person is not legal how is she getting food stamps etc. from the Gov.?<br>  <br>  It is would be the right thing to do to turn her in for her wrong, not because you dislike her, but because it is the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  And while you are there telling on her tell on all the other illegal person that you know that are stealing from the USA GOV. I does not matter if they are from Mexico or Tenbuctue wrong is wrong.<br>  <br>  Remember your daughter is yours keep her here with you!|`|bO2rzfISaa	So, you chose an illegal immigrant to mother child and now you want her deported so you can wriggle out of paying Child Support?<br>  <br>  Actually, I would like to see it made illegal for men like you to create Anchor Babies. Do you know how much a child like that costs over it's lifetime to taxpayers? You're the one who should pay. You knew what you were doing, and you dumped you child in the lap of the American public. I, for one, don't appreciate it.<br>  <br>  I also think you should be forced into a vasesctomy, since you cost the taxpayers so much.<br>  <br>  What would I do? I would choose legal residents to date. You used very bad judgment.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I am a TX resident. I am intimately familiar with the immigration issue.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Anyone who says not to deport her doesn't live in Texas or a border state. People make me so sick when they say it isn't a problem in America, but they live in Washington. They have no idea what it is like. You should deport her and any other illegals you know. The economy is bad enough, we don't need any more illegals.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Sounds to me like you just don't want to pay child support.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Get your child and deport the mother. She is a leech.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	No, it's not wrong.|`|vyNlyfczaa	I don't understand what her status has to do with anything! <br>  If she want to work - I can bet that she can find something! (for someone who wants to work the papers issue wont stop them)... she is just lazy - but let's face it - like american women are not!!! yes they are! you just hate to pay child support!!! Obviously there was no problem with her status while you were sleeping with her?! just pay this what you should, take care of your baby and mind your own business.... <br>  and yes she can get deported and no one cares that the child is US citizen.... the child is 'welcome' here but the mother not - so if you do something you will loose you baby|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	No it's not wrong, all illegals need to be deported, I am for one tired of all their bad doings they bring into this country.|`|3fwJBhJdaa	Deport her.|`|88bDvyiwaa	Deport her and take custody of the kids|`|1YdeUn1Caa	If they're illegal, no. They don't belong here. I'm tired of paying for them to stay here.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If both of her children are American born, you may not be able to deport her.|`|ruczpWrGaa	She cant be deported until the american born child turns 18.  you will just have to deal with the choices you made.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Your explination is a little confusing. If she's doing wrong morally and is using up the countries money and if you think that should could get her life back on track by being sent back to mexico then by all means go for it. However, remember that being deported is a government and legal thing. Maybe you should try talking to her and explaining things. Maybe if you let her know this she will go back on her own. If not you could always just tell her "I'm going to have you deported if you don't go on your own. I want you to clean up your act for your own good". It would be better for her to leave on her own then for it to get legal and messy. It sounds like you care though which is good. <br>  I don't believe that illegal immigrants should be living here either way, but i'm trying not to put my own biased into my explination. If you think that her life would be better there that she would clean up and get responsible then that is possibly the best thing you can do for her.<br>  Just remember whatever happens you need to support the children, whether your being legally forced too or not.

Well, you should tell him that you have liked him for a while. Just tell him how you feel, Im sure that he's also interested in you, if not, why would he ask you out anyway??<br>  Just be yourself. Good luck anyway. Don't worry about what to say.

Age is not the issue here as you are both adults.You should stand your ground as it sounds like its your parents with the issues here as they are feeling jealous that you are growing up and showing affection to someone who is not them and this is scaring them. You have been together with your guy for quite some time now. If his family are very kind I would suggest, if  possible, you move in with them, even if its only temporarily. Your parents are being unfair to treat you in such ways as throwing you out. Once they see that you have his family to turn to and are not in need of them, they may get the shock they need to realise that they cant bully you into breaking with him and either they accept your boyfriend is here to stay, or risk losing their daughter for good. Best of luck :)|`|GQZdLT8Faa	well youre an adult now so you can do w/e you want. if he makes you happy then go with it.
pOTigVYPaa	I think you need to be honest with your friend and tell him exactly how you feel concerning all the things that have been going on.  Drug abuse definitely effects a person's energy output as well as their lack of respect for self and others. Mention the trash scenario and other examples.  Tell him that although you would like to remain friends that some of his behaviors will have to change.  Also, tell him it's wrong for him to disrespect you and verbally abuse you.|`|kGVWV363aa	thats stupid if you break up with your friend <br>  dont break up with your friend like your serious?? <br>  like no just because you think you have better friends never ditch<br>  your old friends soo yeah your lame

You shouldn't say you like him so bluntly but just be casual and say some like "We definitely need to hang out sometime" I'll bet he'd agree and you guys can set up sometime to see each other. Hope I helped!|`|P5zXRe9zaa	As a girl, there is no wrong answer to this question. Simply just relax. If he flirts with you, he probably likes you. So basically just chill out and try flirting with him. Become friends and hang out. Maybe if you flirt with him, he may ask you out in the future. Just don't think about it so much and just relax and let things happen.
QzWHMGHJaa	That will be to rushed!  Do a picnic at a park reception or forget the dinner and just have cake, punch and finger food.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	bad idea.  the bridesmaids and wedding party are exempt from manual labor that day!  it's written somewhere like a law I think.  4pm is way too early to have to clear out.  tell her to find another venue for her reception.  if she was getting married in the afternoon you'd have your hair done at 7am- if she's getting married at 10am I don't know what ungodly hour of the morning you'd have to get to the salon!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	10 am might work.  Wedding til about 11.  Lunch served.  People stay about 2-3 hours leaving at 2 and that gives 2 hours for your people to clean up and get out of there.<br>  <br>  It's a tight schedule and personally I wouldn't do it.  Who is planning on cleaning it all up?  People don't stay as long at Lunch events as evening events so I don't know that the DJ is worthwhile if she is trying to save money.  I know as soon as the cake is cut and the bouquet tossed, people start leaving b/c they have other things to do that day.  An evening wedding people budget the whole evening for it.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If she gets married in the morning she could be done by 4pm if she hires a cleaning crew. She could get married at 10, reception immediately afterward and over by 3, that gives an hour to cleanup.It's possible... <br>  <br>  Good luck!

3fwJBhJdaa	Divorce.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Your example of wanting 3 kids and then the spouse says 1. That seems okay to me. People can change and evaluate life after each situation. We said we wanted 2 and now we have 1. We've tried for a second but it is not working out. Children are not a guarantee in life. We were lucky to even have one. I wouldn't consider that a betrayal at all. I would find a way to work through it. <br>  <br>  On the other hand. I have a friend that wanted 2. She had a son and then twins so now the have 3. Nothing they could have done to foresee twins. Sometimes things just happen.|`|tWD175Pjaa	Depending on how serious you take it. I would try to work things out and talk to my other half before i consider divorce after all marriage is something we are only supposed to do once right? I know it don't always work that way but talk to them and tell them how you feel and remind them of the promise if this promise means a lot to you and they show no concern for it then think about separation|`|E84iCYH2aa	Depends on what you had agreed on. If thats a trifle issue...just let it go...its never a betrayal then. May be the other partner didnt feel it to be that important.<br>  <br>  <br>  But if that a very major issue, as for example not being in touch with ex then it is a betrayal . In that case...speak it out loud and clear and even if it exists...go for a separation and see how things go.<br>  <br>  <br>  Divorce over these things should be the last resort|`|Ub8arVLpaa	Since I do not know what the promise is nor how important it is to you I do not know how to answer.  I would definitely sit down and talk.  If this doesn't work, if you have insurance, try counseling.  My husband and I are in counseling for unkempt promises and they are probably small ones compared to yours since you are asking about the issue.  Try other avenues before deciding about ending the relationship.|`|9BsyKN9haa	I would be disappointed but I wouldn't hold it against them. I change my mind all the time. We actually wanted three children at first, but then after our first my husband changed his mind and wanted only one! I was sad but three years later I talked to him and told him I wanted another child and that would be it we would have only two. We had another baby and he promptly got fixed right after.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	You work with it as best you can.  Circumstances change and people's opinions change.  <br>  <br>  I wanted more children but my husband didn't.  I was disappointed but I got over it.  In the end, I think it was the right thing for us to stop.  <br>  <br>  Life's plans have to be fluid to some extent.  You can't plan things like that years in advance.  Nothing ever turns out like you expect.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	As the time will pass, both of you (= the life) will brake many promises. This belongs to the real life. Usually we do not know the real achievability of that what we promise.|`|m3Nr3U3Jaa	DIVORCE IS NOT THE SOLUTION FOR ANYTHING......LIKE SUCH A SILLY PROBLEM(THE EXAMPLE YOU HAVE GIVEN)........YOU SHOULD TALK........AND IN LIFE WE THINK SOMETHING AND HAPPENS SOMETHING ELSE........<br>  <br>  IF IT IS A BIG PROBLEM......LIKE HE HITS YOU.......HE IS CHEATING ON YOU.....THEN YOU CAN THINK OF DIVORCE.......<br>  <br>  MARRIAGE IS A OTHER NAME OF COMPROMISE........WHERE BOTH OF YOU SHOULD COMPROMISE.......|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Wow. First of all I think God has the say in that matter. Always be careful of what you promise because really the the couple promised something they have less control over than they think. Also many factors can come in to play that could change feelings such as health and finance. As far as getting mad over the broken promise? I think true love would cover that.|`|BUET39wmaa	you have to weigh the consequences of either choice.<br>  is it worth breaking your family up for more kids?|`|GeruGGOQaa	People are entitled to change their minds.  If your spouse has changed his mind about something really important to you, then it's up to you to decide what is more important to you.  Your marriage or this other thing.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Well that's exactly what my husband did to me, he promised me a couple of things, and didn't come through with it. I felt betrayed....

Maybe something was up and he did it because he thought it would be better for you.|`|FgHq93suaa	I know you said guys only, it seems obvious though...<br>  <br>  He may have done something wrong; something he's very ashamed of.<br>  <br>   Door 1- Turning gay, cheating, and etc. (Which would suck)<br>  Door 2  Maybe he's afraid of the commitment?<br>  Door 3 Maybe he's testing the waters? If he loved her and she loved him she should chase after him.<br>  <br>  I hope it helps. And remember there's other fish in the sea! |`|IPf9ycWqaa	That doesn't sound like love to me.  You don't abandon the ones you love.  No.  Apparently, he was a really good actor to have you all convinced he was so in love.  Maybe he was gay and loved her on a friendly level.

Od73sfkxaa	There needs to be a balance between doing things solo and doing things together. My husband and I have never had this problem because I consider him to be my best friend.<br>  <br>  I realize that most people don't necessarily have that friendship trait/quality in their spouse to the degree that I have. We watch movies together, play video games together, we read the same books and trade, and we don't like going to places without each other. We do however, spend time alone...I spend a lot of time on the phone with my family, or doing my hobbies, but we don't go a whole day without doing something together.<br>  <br>  Do you have anything in common (as in hobbies or interests)? If so, let him know that you want to spend time with him...that you miss him. Explain to him that you want to start doing things/activities together. If you don't have anything obviously in common, brainstorm...what about going for walks? going out to eat at least once a month? going to church? watching movies? drawing? painting? photography? etc!<br>  <br>  My husband was an only child. His parents went through a brutal divorce that made him attempt suicide a couple of times. He was very independent and being an only child he never had siblings...the way I got my husband to open up is by letting him know that I am here for him. I mean, I am his wife! He can tell me anything...Anything, and I will still love him. <br>  <br>  Allow him to open up, even if it means crying on your shoulder. I know that seems like something a guy won't do, but it sounds to me like he needs to (my husband has opened up and cried to me about stuff that has happened to him).<br>  <br>  This is very important...he needs to find inner peace over the situation with his mother and father...and come to realize that you are his soulmate...through thick or thin. Because when you have kids it may not bring you closer but farther apart...Almsot all of your time is going to be devoted to a child, and he needs to be stable. He needs to truly know that he is loved and that you are there for him...and spending time together is the perfect way!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I started thinking about my parents. My father always worked away from home, but my parents would always talk on the phone...and when he came home we would always go camping, and my parents love to watch Sci-Fi movies with each other. My parents have been married for almost 23 years.<br>  <br>  My husband's mother and step-dad I can tell are suffering. They have been married for almost 11 years (this is both their second marriage), but it's like they have nothing in common!!! My poor MIL seems like she is always lonely and spending money on clothes or something because she has to fill a void in her life. My FIL is a decent man, but he just doesn't spend enough time with her and it upsets her...but unfortuantely he is stubborn and would rather spend time at his office then spend the evenings with her. Then when she drives over to our house to eat dinner and watch a movie..ring ring ring! there goes her phone..all of a sudden he is lonely...and wants her to come home. Jealously...it's ridiculous. (but I think that is emotionally abusive on his part...she is suppose to stay at home lonely waiting on him and then when she goes to her son's house he decides to come home...)<br>  <br>  So Inconclusion:<br>  <br>  Don't turn into my in-laws! Love each other! Spend time with each other! and don't give your spouse the run-around on love and attention.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Like everything else, there has to be a balance.  Time spent apart, and time spent together.<br>  <br>  If both parties are comfortable with the amount of time spent together, then I can see where it would work.<br>  <br>  However, if one person is comfortable with it and the other is upset by it, it can cause problems.  In this case, communication and compromise would pretty much solve the problem.|`|G50ucmllaa	I think it can work if both people are like this.  What was he like before you married?  Was he this independent?  If not, I would worry that he is unhappy and avoiding spending time with you, that all of his time spend solo is escaping the marriage.|`|AA11785285	Mainly solo?<br>  <br>  Then what did you ever see in this guy?|`|1NwS8UW2aa	Unfortunately, people get married and they start thinking that they found 'their other half' which also implies that we are all incomplete until we get married which is completely wrong. Why would someone look for a mate that is incomplete? I want someone that already knows who they are, not someone that relies on me to 'complete' them. <br>  <br>  Anyway, YES you can have different interests and do things on your own AS LONG AS you continue to do things together. It will work. In fact, doing too many things together and not enough apart with your own individual interests can ruin a marriage. Good luck.|`|ygAkXSknaa	Sometimes I wish I could spend more time by myself. I like it when my hubby has to leave for work early in the morning, so I get to just lay on the couch and watch Sex and the city with my coffee, and then the Soprano's. Not that I don't love him, and it's not that I crave the company of other people, or my friends. I was single for a very long time, and I was always a loner before, even as a kid. I like being alone. He is the first person in my life whom with it feels like being alone, that's why I 'don't mind him'. lol|`|94b8KImYaa	I know a couple which is married and lives in separate apartments, a couple of blocks away from each other. They love each other deeply and are 100% committed, but realized that the day to day togetherness is not for them. <br>  <br>  Besides that, I believe everyone needs to have their privacy in a relationship or marriage. <br>  Is the person in question an only child ? <br>  Only children have no problem doing things alone - they grew up that way. The important thing is that the experiences are shared with each other and discussed. <br>  <br>  Of course of one wants to do things solo and the other one doesn't then there is a great compatibility issue in this relationship.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Depends, some people like doing things alone, so it really depends on whether the other party to the relationship is okay with that or not. If not (as I'm assuming here, hence the question) then I think it has the potential to cause serious conflict.<br>  <br>  Harriet

If she ever comes up to either of you, explain the rules of engagement.<br>  <br>  1) She needs to apologize to you and your other friend<br>  2) She must acknowledge you as her friends in front of her mother<br>  3) No one held a gun to her head when you got in trouble and she needs to take responsibility for her own actions and to grow up.<br>  <br>  If she's not willing to accept all 3, she can find other friends.<br>  <br>  Sounds like she's already broken things off, so don't waste anymore time or energy on that pitiful person.

y2nC8BUGaa	What about getting a stencil and doing black designs on the vases?  Make it look like lace.  Or you could actually attatch lace to them but that could get expensive.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	I like them- I like the containers, they are different. I would not use black table clothes in August- however, add a black ribbon to the white container. I would use two thicker ones with a thin green or black ribbon in the middle. Try finding a way to raise them up more, like an inverted glass bowl (you could put more flowers under it, or maybe a candle. I would try to use what you already have since you have done the work. Depending on what you made the containers out of, you could somehow cut them to be shorter as suggested, but I would try other alternatives before completely changing the container.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Use real flowers instead of fake and use shorter vases. If you have to use those vases,you're pretty much stuck unless you replace the flowers with something like branchs, spraypainted your colors, or pussy willow which you can kind of see through since it's not as bushy. As for the clothes, I don't like black at all. White is so fresh and clean, you could always add a ribbon to the vase or use a black square of fabric under it to break up the monotones. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JWNzoksmaa	I agree, i think they're a little to plain.  I would do a black vase instead of a cream color vase.  You don't want to do a black table cloth only b/c it will show a lot of lint.  What i would do is a 2 piece table cloth.  A black table cloth on the bottom with a square white table cloth on top, but position it so it would be a diamond shape going across the table.  <br>  <br>  Then for the flowers...go a little bit darker green with with a shorter black square vase...something like this <a href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/family.aspx?c=14221&f=9084" rel="nofollow">http://www.crateandbarrel.com/family.asp...</a> <br>  <br>  But in black.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I like them a lot!  I wouldn't do a black table cloth. If anything I would change out the vases to something a bit shorter and maybe make the vase black sitting on a white table cloth. <br>  The flowers are very pretty :)<br>  or just switch out the vases... put them in clear vases with some black stones inside sitting on a white table cloth.|`|AA11603810	Definitely a shorter vase... Maybe glass see-through... or decorate them somehow so they're not solid white.|`|lP04jzv6aa	shorter clear vases. they look heavy.... no to the black table cloths|`|uTdEdpAeaa	well i think the height is fine however it's a plain white vase. my vases were tall in clear cases but i'm sure you don't want to go out there and spend more money on clear vases when you already have these so height wise i don't think you can do anything about that. what you can do is add a contrast by tying a ribbon about 1 1/4 to a 1 1/2 inch black satin ribbon and then on top of the black ribbon would be a 1/2 inch green ribbon centered on the black ribbon around the mid section of to vase. i hope you understand my direction on the placement of the ribbon but that will definitely give your vases a face lift :o) <br>  <br>  about the table cloths i would do a white cloth underlay and a smaller table cloth on top of the white would be your green overlay with black napkins in the glasses. hope i helped.|`|4vr0KGekaa	I used to work at a wedding reception place and I helped with the set-up. I really like them, but they could use more work. I would put them in a lot smaller vases. I like the cylinder shape, just a lot shorter. The height looks good, but it is too tall for a table. Maybe keep these for other places, not on the tables with people. I like the black tablecloth idea. It will look very elegant and more formal. It will look good because the vases are white. I also think that the vases are a little bland. You could use a thick black ribbon with a smaller/thinner green or white ribbon on top. You could also add other patterns with the ribbons, like stripes or polka dots. This would add more character and personality to your centerpieces.|`|cZdXcmFlaa	I think what you have is gorgeous, but if your not happy you could put them in a smaller vase as the other suggest. Or if you wanted to then raised you could get a block of wood or a circle (chopping boards would be cheap) and cover them in a matching fabric with a staple gun laura ashley have some gorgeous green and white botanical prints.<br>  You could also change your flowers if your not happy with them anymore callia lillies are green and white and would be really classic for your wedding.<br>  I wouldnt go for the black table cloth i think it would look cheap and would date also , you dont want to look back at your wedding pics in years to come and think what was i thinking!?<br>  what might be nice is if your having those white/cream chair covers to put a black ribbion around the middle of the chair.<br>  hope that helps good luck with your wedding!|`|RJlB9Q6iaa	I suggest if you are going to use the vases, to take some of the flowers out of them.  They seem a little cluttered and sometimes less is more.  If you don't use them on the table and go with something else, you could use them for floor decorations around your ceremony sight, around the gift table, around the guest book table or maybe use each flower individually in the middle of a pew bow or something <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|ImnZzaRCaa	I feel as if they look very plain and boring especially for a wedding in August. Those centerpieces seem to target someone of an older age.<br>  <br>  How about a glass vase (2.00 a piece at walmart) and put the flowers in there? it would look much nicer and it wouldn't be as high as what you have now.|`|BaixEPeTaa	Take the flowers out of the tubes and arrange them on black squares of satin instead of the whole tablecloth. Maybe also add a small tea candles or candles floating in water in the center of the flowers.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	Ok this is my opinion. Use shorter wider glass vases with black glass marbles . Then put some shiny black thin ribbon in the arrangements.|`|9IaglFQhaa	I think you should just get some green ribbon and make a really pretty bow to go around them I don't think there to tall they just need a little something so i doesn't look so plane Good luck :)|`|wy9rgMGsaa	maybe since the flowers in there are white and green you could paint the vase black, that may stand out better... I think they are nice though|`|zll28kQ1aa	They are to compact have them in bigger glass vases.<br>  <br>  and have some other flower to break it up, as both green<br>  <br>  and white flowers are the same type. :)|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	oooooooooo cute!  I think white tablecloths would look best.  instead of the big white PVC tube, use a clear glass or plastic vase filled with clear marbles or something.  that way it's more translucent.  you don't have to change the height that way.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I like your centerpeieces but would LOVE them with a couple of changes.  I don't think they would look bad on a black table cloth if you tie a black ribbon around the vase.  The vase is a little too plain.  How big are your tables?  They're not a bad height if the table is big enough.  If your tables are small then maybe find a shorter vase.  What are the current vases made of?  Is there anyway to cut them down?  But I think adding a black ribbon around them would make a world of difference and it still ties into your color theme.  Good Luck.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Put it on a pedestal to add some height something like this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/links/link.jsp;jsessionid=ZGVGP1LNM5QDBLAQBBJCCN3MCAEFGIWE?id=0013302016082a&type=product&cmCat=froogle&cm_ven=data_feed&cm_cat=froogle&cm_pla=0250404&cm_ite=0013302016082a&_requestid=29635" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...</a><br>  <br>  OR get shorter vases that would actually look cute in a very short vase.  <br>  <br>  Also I think you should add some color to the vase.  Maybe some black ribbon spiraling down.<br>  <br>  If you can do black table cloths with a green or white runner I think that'd be neat.|`|AA11280073	Use clear glass vases that they can see through. The other solution would be to put them on some kind of pedestal so that they are above people's line of sight.  Do not use black table cloths.

Instead of it being "Jay-me" she could start using the pronunciation as "Hi-me" This way the spelling remains the same, but doesn't sound anything like anyone elses name.|`|LMITClMnaa	well i like her name. lol. atleast its not like my name, dorothy >.< well no 1 relle makes fun of me. but some guys kinda mess with me callin me dorky or when im at school they always assume im in kansas (wizard of oz) well i dont relle care anymoer since im the only dorothy i no (besides tv) so it kidna makes me feel 1 of a kind! (:|`|NxBYuOzbaa	Just call her "Lynn"<br>  <br>  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!|`|I0rTPsN4aa	Give her a Cool Nickname & make it Popular so that she does'nt have to use it more.<br>  Last idea "Change It !"|`|OzBHZ64jaa	you could try giving her a nickname that she likes. <br>  :]|`|ujUt5S4daa	hmm........   give her a really cool nickname, or you can start calling her something else, and eventually, EVERYONE will know her new name, it is just that they need some time to get used to it. and if that doesnt work, take her out to places that can distract her from her "ugly" name. because that will probably work!<br>  hope i helped!<br>  <33|`|kqnVA6KTaa	At least her name doesn't some like something wrong. My cousin's name is Hoor imagine.. Being close to the swear word. But it's her name. Oh and btw, Jamie is a nice and cute name. I suggest to persuade her to keep it.
nie3NZZsaa	***** thats exactly wat i said and u didnt listen to me! instead u listen to a girl named "cute dimples"!!!!!!!!!!!|`|dGBbFwFWaa	best thing to do is..let things cool down a little then talk to her and explain that u care about her but not in love with her..and that u are sorry for having her kicked out the house.. thats all u can really do..
7sA8HwTzaa	First and foremost, I would want to hear from your parents.  I would like to hear them say that they will be supervising you two.  I would want to hear that they and you will pick up the cost of the flights and that they will be at the airport to pick her up with you, provide a room with a bed to sleep in while there (preferably with a sister), and that they will take you and her to the airport when it's time to leave, too.  I would want to hear that they are concerned about the arrangement, but that they also understand your wish to have her there.<br>  <br>  The only thing she should pay for is her gown and accessories and have some pocket money for any minor personal needs.  I don't think it's an unreasonable request and I'd want to hear that you want it so much that you have been working to pay or at least help pay for it.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of unemployed people out there.  If one of your parents is among them, please don't ask them to fund this adventure.  Okay, you're not going to listen to me about that, so if they turn you down in that situation, take it like a man.|`|UTZC8dlHaa	That you will pay all the expenses!!
vkIqaFQ1aa	I'll have him so long as he wears his kilt...........At all times.  LOL<br>  <br>  EDIT, Ah well Irky, in that case I will sadly have to withdraw my offer.

H79YhQbNaa	nope but probably were you're from yes
QP2rOvqlaa	uuuuhhh<br>  u tell him?
AA11065140	Hm, I don't think ivory or cream would really work.  They're too similar, yet at the same time too dissimilar with the grey.<br>  <br>  What are the colors of the wedding?  Does the red coordinate?  If so, I'd probably go with red, or grey with a red pattern.<br>  <br>  I'm not familiar with the term "scrunchie" in reference to mens' clothing.  When I hear the word, I think about the fabric bands we women use to make ponytails in our hair.  Can you expand on what this is and how you'll use it?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Ah...that helps, thanks.  I'm still struggling with the grey & cream, but being as I can't see the exact colors you're looking at, I'd have to take your word for it.  To be sure, it doesn't sound horrible...the red is definitely a nice touch.|`|F8iYNurEaa	OMG! Don't listen to these crazy people!!!! Yes, grey and ivory does go together. Actually, it looks fantastic together. Yes, you can wear a white shirt with an ivory waistcoat....what colour shirt would these nut cases put with a cream suit....duh, white! As for red "scrunchie", well red goes with cream/ivory and it goes with grey. You will look great. If you're not sure then type 'grey morning suit and cream waistcoat' into google images. You will see the grey, cream and red together on all of the first few pages.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I really can't see cream with grey, red, and white. I think that may be too much. I think black may look better or white since your shirt will be white too.<br>  <br>  But, if you like it then wear what you like.|`|0JmDT1AJaa	Have you considered silver? Nothing to spangly or dazzling of course! But a muted light silver might set off the grey in your suit nicely, and the white shirt goes well too.<br>  If you did decide to go for cream, be careful of designs...with red already in the mix you dont want anything to fussy or it will stop looking classic and elegant, and become to 'busy'.<br>  <br>  Hope you find the perfect one!|`|GWM5Wt49aa	Who is the scrunchie for?
WUwIk3Fgaa	nope, never watched it. Was it good? Maybe your wife should watch it, too. Maybe it will give her some food for thought.|`|uZtN5uumaa	I just watched that movie this past weekend and I loved it. It did remind me a lot of my marriage. I suggest if you want to try and change your marriage too, then you should buy "the love dare" and do it yourself for your wife, if you are really willing to change your marriage.|`|PPGAE4n3aa	not as long as you keep comparing yourself to Kirk Cameron.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Joe, Why don't you get the book, The Love Dare, and start practicing that?<br>  <br>  Maybe that'll help you to make yourself into the kind of man that she would love.  By loving her unconditionally.<br>  <br>  Wayner|`|gjaPNWbTaa	I have seen it and wasn't aware of it's hugely religious overtones.  The acting was terrible.  BUT....<br>  <br>  The message however over what makes a good marriage, I thought, was excellent.  I think that movie could easily have the religion watered down, better acting, and be a gold-standard "how to fix your marriage" story.<br>  <br>  My marriage at times did resemble that, although never that badly.  It's way better now.
IikTFnCxaa	Well, to start with, don't let anyone see that it is upsetting you.  Some girls just love to feed off of someone else's insecurities.  And that is what you are showing. So calm down, and just act like everything is fine...Sooner or later, the "newness" will wear off and it should go back to being normal.  Even if it doesn't go back to being normal, this will be a great opportunity to make new friends...And you will discover who your true friends are... I am also betting the new girl is insecure and just wants what you have..So don't go to her level, just rise above it and be gracious about it..|`|TpNHTevSaa	make new friends and don't tell your friend about it.|`|12w7YjRTaa	Make new friends! I'm sure of you their just trying to use her and soon they'll come running back to you.|`|QilfSBfsaa	You should go see why all your friends like her better? Then if you can do better than her, your friends will go back to you.|`|mfkGI2Xlaa	make new friends
B9XTa7Graa	don't be scared and do something about him if you're so bothered. That what i would do.|`|1xD8lVi4aa	Ignore him. or get some one to stand up to him and tell him shut his mouth.<br>  <br>  He is just being a pain to you.
JEteneuUaa	Dang your grandpa a ruff rider.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	What can you say?  Your grandfather is a creep.  If you live with him, I'd search his room and his computers (you might want to check for cameras placed in your room).  And you are just going to have to tell him to stay away from you and your friends from now on.  He's not worth your love and respect any more.|`|l4jSgRRmaa	I agree with telling your parents TODAY!  If they do not take you seriously tell a counselor at school.  You can tell your teacher you would like to talk to them.  Your grandfather should not be living around children.|`|58H53s8maa	wowww...just tell him that you think its inappropriate and it makes you uncomfortable. then tell him that your friend hasnt called back because of it and your really embarressed. maybe he will get the point|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Tell your parents. your safety is in question.|`|hnc7Epqdaa	WoW! I defeetely think you should talk to an adult anyone whom is close to you, or try an get counseling so that you can have a more wide response on this. I cant say much because I dont know that entire story like do you live only with him? are yyour parents around? are you old enough to get away from him? if you feel uncomfortable he should respect you and you need to show him how. Tell him how incomfortable you feel over the incident that happend, and how your friend doesnt feel good about your friend not calling you because you truly care for her. One of the most important things you can do here is tell him your true ffelins instead of hiding them because that wont help the situation. If your mad, sad whatever the feeling is let him know. tell him why and try to come up with an agrrement. That is extremely disrespectful. Set some standards for this, for if this happens again. Like you can try an sleep in your neighboors house or families house a couple of days until you get your head clear or tell him you will be out to speak to someone because you wont tolerate that. If he continues there are many things he can harm like your friendships. Be strong and set standards because if you dont it will seem to him that it is find. You need to feel safe and you dont and he is not taking your feelings into consideration. one more thing are you sure he only does this when your frined is around or multiple times, because you may be in danger too, he may for some reason fantasize about you. listen you need to try and talk to him and get into an agrrement or else take action remember your feelings are important too dont ignore the, please!!!  Take lots of care.
TiX5Z4Zbaa	Get some training.  Find a job you like.  Do it while you're young, it'll make life easier.<br>  Be part of the solution not part of the problem.|`|6SQiRWPUaa	"i think she turned me into a bum." Until you take responsibility for your own actions you won't be able to get off the ground. Motivation stems from knowing who you are and what you want. If you keep blaming others for "turning" you into something or other then you're like a leaf blowing in the wind with no aim or direction. Unfortunately this is the example you're likely to set for you daughter. Let this be a wake-up call and while your daughter is still young, figure out who you are, what your values and goals are, and steadily work toward them with conviction and INTERNAL dedication. You should have had this figured out before you had a child. Let this be one of the few "cart before the horse" things in your life and don't create more. Good luck.|`|QvDOyPjBaa	You are admitting that you were dependent on her.  It's time to pick yourself up and dust yourself off.  It's easy to get into a mentality in which you feel and become lazy.  You got used to it.  just find any type of job and start there.  Motivation will come later.  You have to begin with the action and hopefully the motivation will come later.  Good luck to you.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	You sound depressed. Life is hard work. You have to get out and and make a living whether you feel it or not. Take care of your child by supporting him or her financially and stay working. See your child as often as possible and don't stress or add drama to your life in any way.|`|eemmWU0Haa	You bum|`|E7RhMRKhaa	You started out a mooch and she turned you into  a bum ???  Right|`|29hcn9JRaa	What happened to you as a man you ask? My personal opinion is that obviously your not a real man now, and have never been one, I think you have been in a mans body for years but you have the mentality of a 16 year old kid. As no real man would ever, ever put the blame for their actions on someone other then themselves, you acted like a bum and are a bum merely because this is life as you know it, no one, not your parents, not your ex wife, not your friends, has made any contributions towards your bum lifestyle, this was all your doing. So the question you should be asking is, what can I do today to change my life around? how can I not be a bum anymore? how can I better my life in order for my child to see me as a role-model? However I am guessing that you will continue on with the egotistic bum attitude and place the blame on others, and you will do this only because it is easier, most losers prefer to act as if everything is so hard while pointing the finger at others. Dude, its past time to be thinking about growing up, life isn't all about you. My advise is for you to get your butt off your sofa and start manning up to the world.|`|48fe5f79560bff851b618351681d3eafaa	Look to your past and you may see why your have become so unmotivated. Were your parents like this? Is this something that only happened after you married and moved in with your wife?<br>  <br>  Your wife did not turn you into this, she enabled you. You lacked what it took to get going and she gave you a way not to do it. <br>  <br>  Are you afraid that there is nothing that you know how to do. Are you afraid that if you try to do something you will fail so it is easy to just not do it? Becoming motivated is very much like exercise. The more we force ourselves to do it the better we get at it and soon we actually find it fun because we feel a great sense of accomplishment.<br>  <br>  It is always difficult to get started but once you do, makes no difference what you decide to do, you will find it gets much easier. <br>  <br>  Right now you are not very proud of yourself. More than anything else you need to get that back.  What is your education? Did you finished high school? If not then you need to get your GED because no one is going to hire you without one or the other. To not have those shows lack of motivation and they can't take a chance on you. Having one or the other shows that you have the ability to stick to something and finish it. That is critical to an employer.<br>  <br>  If you have high school and maybe even a little college then you have a great start. First thing to do however is get a job. Makes no difference what it is just something to pay the bills. Then begin considering what you would like to do with your life. Remember, if you have no plan then it means you plan to fail. <br>  <br>  There is not a person on this planet that has not had to face what you do right now. Look to someone you admire and see how they do it. <br>  <br>  You must remember that attitude is everything. You can and will only do what you think you can. Just do it.|`|PD1cshTSaa	Not to be insulting, but it sounds to me like what happened is she smartened up and stopped supporting you. I can't say exactly why you weren't motivated, but most likely because you had it so easy, maybe because you enjoyed spending time with the child and in your subconscious you didn't want to ever leave his/her side, maybe you actually were too dependent on her. Anyways, life seems hard now because 1)-these changes are pretty huge, being kicked out and divorced from your wife would be hard for anyone; and, 2)-you are probably concentrating a bit too much on the past and where it all went wrong, instead of what you can do with your life NOW. Whatever you do, you can't give up. To think about the child and becoming a good provider and great father should be your main concern, I think. I hope this helps.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	uh pretty sure u answered ur own question:<br>  u just said that you think SHE turned you into a bum... uh bud your in denial your lazy you didnt be the MAN in the relationship and you didnt support ur own fricken fam! pretty sure she didnt stop you from lookin for a job, and babied you. the divorce was a wake up call so now pick up the pieces and get a job :D|`|lq0JNwK7aa	You lack the drive to do things? Have you always been this way? Maybe it's a psychological problem, like mild depression?<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, turn your life around in small steps. Start with getting a job. That will help you get motivated and feel like you're doing something with your life.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	You first need to look for a job and become responsible.

It won't hurt, and after all...it's only your life we are talking about here. You are very young and have alot of yrs, I hope you want to spend them being happy.

Boo hoo!!!<br>  <br>  I suggest you get a job fast. You are going to have to pay child support. If I was your ex-wife, I would make sure you paid child support, it's the very least you can do. If you can't motivate yourself to get a job, she can also do that for you too. When you don't pay child support, she can file charges against you for non-support. The judge will give you a certain amount of time to pay all your back child-support. If you fail to get the money paid in time, then he will throw your lazy butt in jail. How many times do you think you will have to go to jail for non-support, before you will be ready to become a man and a responsible father and get a job???<br>  <br>  You think life is so hard now?

Tell the media, find a reporter that you like either print or tv and call them, the best would be a young or new reporter, or one that investigates scams, frauds ect. tell them what you know, they will protect you as long as they want to stay out of jail, most likely you won't get credit but that is not why you are doing this..

XTDNdE28aa	why would you want to stop thinking about the people you love? i think you should write them letters , and each day sit down for 20 mins and add something new. when you see them again, you dont have to give it to them if you dont want to, but its much healthier to let it out in little bursts than a freak out. however, dont obsess about them all day. cos your only young , and you have heaps of relationships ahead of you. keep a balance. dont get so caught up in your own head:) good luck!

That said, I am a really generous person too and am only expecting the same consideration I give in return.

He has never bought me a Christmas or Birthday card and only buys (or makes) me a Christmas present each year because our children and grandchildren come and he knows what they would say if he didn't...<br>  <br>  Mean-ness is the very worst thing to cope with when you are committed to a relationship; it poisons every aspect of your life.<br>  <br>  Dump him; you know he's mean - & he'll get worse as he gets older.|`|sN8aqb95aa	You've really got to give him a serious talk.<br>  I recon he is just being lazy, but he's still got to be a bit considerate!<br>  <br>  It just doesn't sound right, because when i was 11, i bought my girlfriend presents for all occasions! If i can do that, then surely he could do something for you.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if you are in school, then i guess you shouldn't do anything like dump him, as loads of guys do that, as they don't have the money from going out everywhere with you, like to the cinema!|`|L2t7Ek4paa	Could be how he was raised? I know when I was growing up presents, birthdays, christmas etc were not a big deal. I don't remember ever receiving or buying a present until i started dating my gf at 17 so... I dunno. It took me awhile to break the habit of not receiving or giving out presents. Otherwise I would just assume he is cheap :-P.|`|CiK6M31haa	my boyfriend is exactly the same, he didnt buy me anything for valentines day, and i got him a concert ticket. and he was just like oh thanks, ill get you something but he never did. He never remembers our anniversaries, and its my birthday on monday and i can bet he hasnt got me anything! haha i suppose thats some boys for you. I know what you mean its so annoying though, but have you asked him about it?|`|EcQMQeyIaa	Any guy who's happy to accept gifts and things without reciprocating is a total cheapskate. I'd dump the loser!|`|rgwatxBhaa	Get someone who deserves you? maybe he just hasnt got money at the moment? or maybe he is just a .... yea you know<br>  <br>  just an idea...<br>  <br>  hope it helped
AuKKjaxaaa	My wife's a teacher.  She's not boring.  She reads a lot of romance novels though.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Don't do it.<br>  <br>  He's smart.  You, on the other hand, are obviously an idiot.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Yeah, I dated a man who used to be a teacher and then he chose another profession.  He used to teach English in high school.  He was pretty boring, I must admit.  His grasp of the English language left a lot to be desired as well.  I used to think of the children he taught.  Talk about "misguided youth."  But everyone's different.  This teacher may be a great guy.  Give him a chance.  Judge him on his own merit not by just his job.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I am dating a professor at the college. He is not boring.  He is fun, entertaining and a great conversationalist.|`|iOo9MAxJaa	It depends on the person. Being a teacher doesn't automatically make someone "boring."|`|H0LfFGmlaa	It depends on what they teach. A fat gym teacher nein but a young anatomy teacher....hhmmmmmmmm,,,,|`|rDmMk9Soaa	I was a teacher at a high school where we happened to have a group of teachers who were either divorced or single and we started hanging out together socially. That was one rowdy group when the let their hair down on the weekends.

They hate fun. Its a requirement.<br>  What worries me most is that a teacher actually asked you out on a date.|`|WfwlGbUAaa	I read in the mirror newspaper ages ago that a girl ran away with (maybe married) her teacher, he was like 50 too.|`|wIOf22wRaa	Teachers are not necessarily boring, they're just people like us, maybe you think they're occupation is boring. But, if you really like him then go for it.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	My daughter has and they are now married. He's my favorite son-in-law. He's far from boring. They act one way on the job and totaly different outside. Hey catch this one yu never know.|`|AA11706291	I dated a history teacher, he made me laugh and well I wasn't disappointed lol|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	Depends on what he teaches!  If he starts grading you on a bell curve then get worried.|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	I know lots of teachers. They tend to have amazing senses of humor and really love talking to people as well as listening to them. They have to in order to deal with stupid kids and teens that refuse to pay attention in class. :D My dad is a teacher. He makes everyone laugh every chance he gets, and goes vacationing in Vegas with his wife regularly. My brother is a teacher and was practically stocked by the girls at his HS and College cause he was always attractive and fun to be around. One of my friends teaches little kids. She is the one who first got me drunk, as well as the one who nursed my hang over. (we also throw amazing pool parties) If he's boring it's cause he's boring, not cause he's a teacher.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	just because he is a teacher doesn't mean he cant have fun or be fun just make sure its what you want and make sure the age gap is not to big|`|Fi2nUvYcaa	Ya I married a teacher. My former wife taught me to distrust emotionally unstable women. She was a great teacher.

People have interests...most guys like electronics...most girls don't.<br>  <br>  With me it would be 90% did I like the girl and 10% what she liked.  After all I can vist Best Buy alone and she can shoe shop alone.<br>  <br>  But it would sure be neat to go see the gadgets with her.|`|GYij4N13aa	Wow, I would love having a friend/girlfriend like you. We would have more to talk about =D It's good to see a girl interested in electronics.<br>  I would love to meet you one day, lol.<br>  <br>  None of my girl friends have any interest in computers and that sucks sometimes.|`|L8iI0Ocraa	No. Sometimes it just makes me feel inferior ( no offense ). My ex girlfriend actually knows more about computers than I do. She knows codes and HTML thinggies but I don't know anything at all! Somtimes actually we played gears of war and she owned me. It was funny.|`|iIWwZrvEaa	it really depends. am a girl and i know guys who date both.|`|60203fef7d7aa03bf1920ab812cbacaaaa	No not at all. i much prefer a girl with a llittle bit of a brain and does something she likes|`|4IHe4rPYaa	lol yes. stop using Y!A.|`|vzRwazI0aa	yes.|`|L2t7Ek4paa	Lets face it, half those girls are probably into some of the same things you are. But I suppose now a days it isn't "cool" to be yourself. As for if it is a turn off, no of course not. At least people are getting a preview of the real you, and not some persona.|`|o6bl7Nkwaa	Girls who like technology and electronics can be really hot, atleast to me. If you share a common interest with a guy then that's obviously going to help win him over, be yourself and don't worry about what others will think. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  Sarla.|`|neFebL63aa	I find it horrifying.  Ladies should dress smart, stay trim and made up, keep there mouths closed, and not stick their moses into stuff like electronics and such.  They will never figure it out and then us guys have to clean up their mess.|`|53ZnTtPeaa	Everybody like different people and things. You will find a guy that shares your interests if you change or try to change to be with someone you won't be happy. Just be yourself and let life happen.

dR2bqUixaa	It's like panties that have a lock on it. So if your parents don't want you sexually active then they lock you in it and keep the key. You will have to ask them to unlock it when you have to use the bathroom.|`|S2LH6L8Uaa	A chastity belt is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse and possibly masturbation. The purpose may also be to protect the wearer from rape or temptation. Devices have been created for males and females.<br>  <br>  The term "chastity belt" is also used metaphorically in modern English to imply over protectiveness. The term carries a derisive connotation and may also imply that the subject is antiquated, or is cumbersome, or provides unnecessary or unwanted protection.<br>  <br>  According to modern myth the chastity belt was used as an anti-temptation device during the Crusades, that when the knight was away from his young wife, he would force her to wear the belt day and night. There is no evidence or any documentation of such use, nor evidence of the existence of chastity belts until the 15th century, more than one hundred years after the last Crusade. On the other hand, it has been used as an anti-masturbation device for children in modern times from the 1700s to the 1930s. Nowadays it is sometimes used as BDSM equipment.<br>  <br>  The actual use, if any, of medieval chastity belts would have been very limited, as the metalworking of the times would have made it difficult to fashion a belt safe for long-term wear.[1]|`|lYctCgNlaa	A chasity belt is a belt the covers women's privets<br>  with metal plates so it could prevent rape, intercourse,<br>  and masturbation<br>  the same go's for men<br>  <br>  <br>  heres a pic of the women's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chastity_belt.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chasti...</a><br>  <br>  and his a pic of the mans<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Carrara_klein_frontaal.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a>|`|cHkH7ESuaa	It's that thing body-builders wear at the gym to keep their guts from splitting when they lift heavy weights.

Perhaps you should be asking your husband what exactly he has been going around saying about your relationship to give people such a negative spin on the two of you.  It sounds like he has been saying unpleasant/doubtful things about you to this woman.<br>  <br>  in any case, ask him to tell you exactly what kind of conversations had been going on, and what he said to make this girl think he should break off your marriage.<br>  <br>  Something is definately wrong here though, get to the bottom of it!|`|ev33OxJbaa	He married you, not anyone else.

Have him allow you to listen in, while he tells her that they can no longer have any contact of any kind because he is married. If he won't do that, then that's because he's affraid of what she will say when he calls, which would be something that would let you know that they were cheating.<br>  <br>  If she was just some girl trying to stop him from getting married, then why did he hide it/her from you?

Sure it seems like a loooong way away, but it's really not.   If you don't want to grow up and be like your mom, use your anger towards her to do good in school and stay on the right track.

MOMb0Amoaa	That was not the right thing for your husband to do.  It is natural for you to fel miserable about this.  But men are full of mistakes.  Your husband is no different.  A woman is a man's weakness.  So please dont be so upset about this.

4H76AzUkaa	You need to ask him if he wants to be with you or not. Preferably do this face to face. Tell him you need to see him and you have something important to say. Then explain how you think  his behaviour is uncaring and you would not want to end things but he's forcing you to. It may be that he's lost interest and doesn't have the backbone to tell you. Make it an ultimatum, he either spends more time with you or calls more often or you'll have to move on. <br>  Ps.

You   could   attempt  to  talk  to  em  about  it,  which  seems  to be  what   you said  you  attempted, but  the  thing  is  it  takes  2   to  make  a  relationship  and  if  he's  not  going  to   try   then  it's  not  worth   the  drama.

The 2nd one reminds me of a more religious robe, the lacy train on the 2nd is quite formal... Personally, i'd go for the first one, but It depends which one would fit your build better.

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	I'm sorry but you've allowed this to go on for the past 4 years!? Your wife is either:<br>  <br>  1. cheating on you<br>  2. has a hormone imbalance that has decreased her sex drive<br>  <br>  There is no way I would sit around with a woman that only tried to satisfy me with her hands. Not that I condone it but situations like this destroy marriages and cause people to cheat. If she cares about you at all, she should be willing to attend sex therapy.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to sound negative but if she refuses, your only choices are to continue with a sexless marriage for the rest of your life or divorce.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Sounds like you have found a way to "stuff" your feelings during the day, but they come out heavily in your dreams, simply because you are not dealing with them in your waking hours.  You can't stuff the emotions during your dreams, nor should you when you're awake.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Dreams are sometimes better than real life. Dreams are fantasy or just crazy events in your head while sleeping.<br>  Your choice to divorce was probably a good one.|`|jofuVL9Baa	A marriage is a serious business.  <br>  1. The fact that you keep busy during the day and don't think about her doesn't erase your feelings -which you must've had for her.  <br>  2. Its a combination of feelings, plus the stress of the divorce that you might not be aware of.  <br>  3. Another possibility is that deep down you don't want a divorce and it really is affecting you more than you want to admit to yourself.  <br>  If there's nothing to salvage, time is your best friend, you will move on with time.  If you think things can be rebuilt, work on your relationship through counseling.  Good Luck!
JhvqUvlsaa	You have to get away if they are making you want to hit them; because if you do, you'll have a lot bigger problems to deal with. Just count to 10 and tell them look I need 5 minutes could you please give me that because I am really frustrated? Then we'll talk after I get back.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA10556592	Call the police & get a restraining order.|`|UrGaDqL6aa	I have the same problem with the retard that won't stop bothering me that I have to ride the bus with, go to school with, and deal with almost 24/7.  Anyway, find someone equally as irritating as the person that's bothering you, find something they have in common, and bring it up when they are nearby each other.  I've done it before, but in my current predicament, there doesn't seem to be anyone more annoying and stupid as him on the planet, except a drug addicted baby.<br>  <br>  And unfortuanetly, for most people, you will realize that ignoring them just will not work...at all.  In fact, it can make it worse.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I just took ANger mgmt class.  They say to think of the consequences of your actions.  Think of a solution to the problem that may benefit both parties.  Use "I" a lot.  Don't tell the other person why they are pissing you off.  Keep it about yourself.  You can't control others.  Only how you react.|`|zhwR2XiBaa	They sound like their life is a lot worse then they are making yours. Just get away as fast as possible and laugh at their stupidity. Don't allow yourself to feel bad. Thats what they want. Its not you that needs to feel bad anyways. The only thing feeling bad will do is get them what they want and make you miserable. If the problem persists contact the proper authorities.|`|tx5FnOmXaa	wat i would do <br>  <br>  <br>  id punch them then if they try to hit u back threating them works :D|`|DznKniWhaa	There is many choices that you can choose. Run away, hide somewhere safe, hire a body guard, call the police, tell them to back off then hit them and run, or you can just stay home, lock your doors and never leave your house.|`|Uy4bRGCVaa	RUNNNNNNNN<br>  and run very fast. <br>  that's  a very bad quality for someone to have and it will end up making you depressed and regretting that you ever met or were nice to that person|`|KKwL5S88aa	walk away. then go like running or exercise to release the built up tension. or like write about how pissed you are and rant so you let it out.<br>  just dont bottle it up cs you will lash out eventually and that wont be pretty at all.|`|sVVGAZNAaa	Try to talk reason to them. If that doesn't work, befriend someone who is bigger and stronger than them to protect you. Kind of lick a bodyguard.|`|2YgeLlomaa	Ignore them and think about something else.<br>  <br>  If they are a man, go into a women's bathroom.|`|kzz2Efydaa	Nothing, silence is the worst insult.|`|844a29a5e3bafc616c72ad92171d0d26aa	buy pepper spray.. verbally abuse them if you cant do it physically :P
AA10693260	I envy your husband. Really, to be at leisure all day long and getting away with it because of depression. Wow!<br>  <br>  I think he is getting in to a habit of doing nothing. Its time you start shouting and make him work. Just make his life miserable at home, then, maybe,  he will go and find some job.|`|AA10461616	I would think a foreclosure notice would be enough to give anyone a major personality change.  Both of you are overwhelmed it sounds and understandably so.  You say he sleeps on the couch so he doesn't have to talk to you about the marriage.  Are you sure you know how to calmly, and w/o blame, talk to each other?  Do you say- I love you and I am scared too, but we have got to work on this together.  Or, do you say things like,  You never________.  You always____________  Why can't you____?  It sounds like both of you are stressed and pushed to the max and feelings are on edge.  I am not defending his behavior but maybe he honestly is overwhelmed with taking care of the kids w/o doing any housework, especially if those things were never his strong point anyway.  Best advice?  Talk gently with each other w/o anger.  Don't less this evil economy claim your home and your marriage.  It's a storm for certain and you need each other to weather it.  Good luck and I hope he finds a job soon.  Will the new laws help your foreclosure situation?  You need to get with your lender or even an accountant can tell you if you qualify to re-fi or for reduced payments, etc.  My husband just took a major pay cut and it has been very scary and stressful.  You have got to figure out a way to lean on each other.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	He is not doing his fair share and I would bet he is not looking to hard to even find a job. You need to sit him down and tell him to get his act together.|`|AA11084005	Marriage is so hard, if I didn't love my husband so much he would've been gone a long time ago.  I work two full time jobs plus clean the house and mow the yard, and he works part time and sits on his butt and plays video games.  We have no kids, and we also don't spend much time together.  I'm in the same boat as you.  Just stop cleaning and when he has no clothes to wear, no dishes to eat out of, etc maybe he will get the hint.  Also, when you do laundry only wash your own clothes.  That's what I had to do, and it worked a little, but mine still don't help me as much as I'd like him to.|`|GjwlfDLdaa	That is pretty lame. Sounds like he's in a huge slump. It might be totally killing his masculinity to see you work everyday and he doesn't want to slip into the 'stay at home dad' position.<br>  <br>  Try to give him a break from asking him to do things, I know there are a ton of things that need to be done, but if you can get him to do them on his own, it will cut your stress down. My hubby is more inclined to join me in cleaning and such when he sees me starting it. Sometimes, I'll sneak away and let him finish. He knows that you work hard and have to come home to do a double shift, just try using actions rather than words.<br>  <br>  This too shall pass...|`|KSK22vHUaa	Oh honey.  It's time to raise your voice and get angry and mean.  Make a list and treat him like a lazy child for not doing his chores.  I'm sorry, but if he isn't going to act like a grown up, there's no point in treating him like one.  I'm sorry he's depressed for not working, but it's time to deal with it and be mature and do what he can to support his family.  If he can't do it financially, fine.  Let him take care of the house.  He cannot act like another child for you to clean up after!!  That's insane!!  Throw something at him and make him do some damn work!|`|c406fc3a14c6313fcc036b200a41288baa	Doesn't sound like he has changed at all.<br>  <br>  You have been dealing with this longer than him being out of work.<br>  <br>  Is it worth fighting over? or Ending your relationship over?<br>  <br>  He is not going to do the cleaning just because he is not working.<br>  <br>  Be grateful that he does what he does and do what you can. If it doesn't get done the world isn't going to stop. Get to it when you can.<br>  <br>  Hope he gets a job soon.|`|cXi6oWMkaa	men are like another child, im sorry to say. he is spoiled. all these years you have done for him... cook, clean, laundry,finishing what he doesnt. when you finally stop doing for HIM and do for yourself, he may just realize what you DO do and be more of a helping hand.Stop doing his laundry, stop cleaning up his messes, stop cooking for him. do these things for you and the kids only. he'll wake up!!
iPNOVR6Gaa	Of course there's logic behind her actions - she loves him.  So he's not so great at being a husband, sure.  But she loves him, plain and simple, and as clear as the nose on your face.  Maybe she doesn't want to love him, and maybe she even wishes she could love someone else, like you.  Maybe she really is in love with you.  But if she is, that means she's in love with two men.  The question you have to ask yourself is whether or not it is OK with you for her not to be in love only with you.  If you decide it is OK, you need to shut up about her interacting with the ex-husband who she loves.  If it's not OK, you need to either give her an ultimatum, or leave her.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Leave her.<br>  I could not imagine doing that to someone I am WITH, much less love. <br>  I do understand the love for the father of a child...somewhat.<br>  The more she talks about him, the worse it is.|`|KOXcw4klaa	her problem is that she is not over him.even though he is what she says and knows he is not right for her,she still has feelings and cannot let go of him.what she is doing is wrong.she does not need to talk to the ex at all.she could use a third party type person when it comes to the kid.so if i were you i would put my foot down and tell her no more contact period or your walking.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	Seems like she has a few unresolved issues with the ex. Does it mean that you can't have a future with her, no. It does mean there needs to be a few ground rules for your sanity though. You cannot cut off all contact because he is baby daddy but I would tell her it needs to be more public than private. The whole webcam thing is just wrong on so many levels. Sounds like you and her need to have a long heart to heart and set things right. If you still feel this way in a few weeks, break it off and find someone else because it isn't going to change. Good luck and I hope she gets her act together because it sounds like you really care for her.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	the logic is that if it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.  i know that you love this woman, but you are getting played like a flute.  i don't buy for a minute that she's "just joking" when she says those things to the ex.  i would bet you anything that what they have going on has gone past simply "sexting" as well.  <br>  <br>  i would confront her about it and say that you won't tolerate this anymore.  however, be prepared for resistance.  don't sit around and wait for her to give you the boot.  i would have some hope, but i would start planning my exit strategy as well.
uL8xwjaFaa	i think you should continue it.if its a cast problem then you should try convincing your parents that cast system is useless.you shouldnt just dump her coz of her cast.if you cared so much about the cast then you shouldnt have loved her in the first place.you shuld love her not her cast.n you are the one marrying her not the ppl who care about her cast.and if its still impossible then either dnt marry her n have a cohabitation relationship.just live with her like a couple n alwayz be with her.then your parents will   ahve to get you mmarried.n if you cant do that then just leave her.coz their is no point of loving her for so long n not wanna be in a married relatiiionship.just let her go n let her have a relationship with someone who accepts her for who she is n not her cast.
ulJumHilaa	well first of all lying is not the best thing to do because you can only get caught up in your lies sonner or later. so the best thing to do is go to them and tell them the truth y u came home so late they will have no choice but to let it go because they did the same thing when they were kids probalby.|`|CGsprI3Caa	i dont think you should lie at all really your parents need to know the truth if you tell them the truth they might get a little mad but then they might get over it|`|Xw2JFBVpaa	act sincere. cry a little. accuse them of having alzheimer's.|`|FVhXSQeNaa	Say you ended up going over to a friends place and fell asleep|`|TvXpONJ8aa	say that it was held by the cops or there was a after party thats what i do lol|`|AQmcmW6paa	OH I love this game! :P<br>  <br>  1.

Lost track of time..?<br>  <br>  4. You left early and got caught up with things and totally forgot that you were supposed to be home.<br>  <br>  5.

Your car broke down??<br>  <br>  Just some ideas cause I don't know how old you are or what time you were supposed to be home but I hoped I helped!!|`|sDYtDDE4aa	don't do this again because they TRUST you.
jBigEy0Caa	Going to counseling is not putting your business on the streets.  She probably knows she is wrong here and doesn't want to hear it.  You have some major problems brewing, and better get some help ASAP.  Sleeping on the couch is not a good thing at all, and it sounds like she has major problems with sex in general from her first marriage.  I couldn't imagine living with someone who wasn't willing to work with me.  I really hope you can get this worked out.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Get out of it and take the kids with you.  She sounds lazy.
IPS3hWweaa	Yes, you should try to work things out if both you feel love for each other and are both willing to listen to each other and try to understand where the other is coming from. Don't give up on something when there is real love involved.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Does he have so much foolish pride that he won't consider a marriage counselor?That would be the best thing to do, a counselor is objective and nonjudgmental and could probably find a way to either work with or solve your problems. How would you  feel if you were the one who said let's get back together? It may be left up to you to instigate the reconciliation.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	Of course you should.  Tell him over dinner it's time to get over the crap you're disagreeing about and get back to loving each other.<br>  <br>  Edit:  If he's as "proud" as you say he's not the man you described earlier.  He should be smart enough to be "manly" until faced with the expensive, painful finality of divorce.  He simply can't be that shortsighted or maybe he's worth losing.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i believe yes, you should try work things out together first before getting a divorce. if both of you can just sit down and talk and set aside your differences, i'm sure both of you can work something out.|`|WVcUweTEaa	Why are you both no asking each other that question and then based upon the answer...make the choice to keep working at it together or to just let it go and move forward in your lives seperatly.|`|3fwJBhJdaa	He's probably shellacking other women by now. Divorce.
UuSquKa8aa	We can't tell you of his intentions, unfortunately. Just ask him about it, but be very calm and relaxed about it. Don't yell, don't get mad. If you do, he'll most likely react with anger. Just say "Honey, I was checking the call log for missed called, and I saw you dialed this number at 1AM and 3AM. Just wondering who it was?" Smile, be nice, and he might come clean.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	He's having an affair, or he's a doctor on "call".|`|GYoNyoWtaa	he is wanting to leave yawls bed for hers|`|cGbTJobeaa	It depends what he is calling her about.  My husband works in IT.  If the systems crash during the night, he gets paged. Sometimes he has to call a co-worker to resolve the issue.  And that co-worker might be a female. No big deal.<br>  <br>  My point is...it could be legit or it could be a sign that he is cheating.|`|15dA7weiaa	It depends why he's calling her. Usually it means he's sneaking around behind you or her husband.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	And you call yourself bright?|`|AA11401294	it means that you are asleep and this is the best time to call her|`|FDxeKTidaa	hes tryna have a sideline hoe my hubby trid to do it to me n then he realized that if it went any furter i was gon fuk bof of em up getr his phone and call her and let her know wat it is if she tr to break up ur fam i hate grimey *** hoew as a matta of fact ill call 4 u if u scared email me amandaloveschris4eva@yahoo.com|`|bNuuxJv1aa	It means there is a very good chance that he is cheating on you.

Don't ever call anyone you suspect your man of playing around with, it weakens  and makes a monster of you.  When she calls, give him the phone and walk out of the room. Don't beg for respect , Demand it!|`|ogtHK7Eiaa	FOLLOW UR FIRST INSTANCE <br>  I AGREE 100% THAT HE IS CHEATING <br>  BUT IF U WERE SEPERATED DOESNT THAT MEAN U WAS BREAKING UP OR SOMETHING...

I am not going to say anything mean to you because you are in a rock and a hard spot!  i mean you have 4 kids with this dumb *** and he is out skirting behind your back!  What a dirty d*ick!  Please get rid of him before he gives you a disease.  You are going to have to be a strong woman and pick up the pieces for you and your kids.  That woman is a home wrecker and she is allowing your man to cheat.  But don't worry, I believe in bad karma, and so should you, it will come back on the 2 of them, the will pay the price of being dirty!  If he is notorious for doing this in the past, then he is doing it now, go with your gut, and do not stay with him this time.  get away from him file for custody and child support and get a job and raise them babies by yourself, you can do it!!  he is a pig!!!!!|`|t81MEJ82aa	Then if you don't love him, sleep with him, and just using him to get your education then why do you care? He could be cheating on you, but I can't stand people who act like cheating is the only thing that matters in a marriage.

And if there's nothing odd going on why won't she take your calls? if i had a good friend who was a man, who was married, i'd be going out of my way to make sure his wife was comfortable with the situation. <br>  <br>  Why won't she answer you?  tell you what, take his phone when he's not looking, go to her number, change it to your number, but keep it listed under her name, so that when he texts her, it comes to you.  you'll soon know what's going on. <br>  <br>  do you know where she works? i'd go and see her.  Do you mean she is a counsellor rather than a councilor?  if she is the former, then it's very unprofessional and i'd contact her employers. <br>  <br>  good luck.

55zWUXcUaa	I feel like it takes away from each couple.  No one gets the full spotlight and I can almost guarantee there will be some form of competition.  Do you even have similar tastes so you can pick things out together or will this wind up being the wedding of your future SIL's dreams and you will just have to go with her choices?  I'd rather pay for my own wedding and have it be my own than my parents paying for a wedding for myself and a sibling.|`|4vr0KGekaa	I think double weddings could be really cute and fun. It would save money and I think most guests would like it, because they would only have to go to one wedding instead of two. But I think it is completely your decision. I don't think that I would want to share my special day with anyone else. Do you like her? Would you be willing to work together on planning everything and to agree on things? Do you have the same tastes? I think it would be a very unique and cool wedding (if it is done right) but it just depends on how you feel about it. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing anything you don't want to do. Even if it would save money.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	It may sound ideal to the parents, but the truth is they will probably end up spending just as much. They just need to set aside a certain amount for each wedding and anything you spend beyond that you are responsible for.

I would never do it, but then again I like to be an attention hog.|`|jaw1g0Dkaa	this is just my opinion...i think it is rather tacky...it takes away all of the special feelings of it being 'your day' and it would take a lot of the romance out of the day for me|`|YyiESOpFaa	i think it will take away some of the......special...you know? it's not just YOUR wedding anymore....so yeah.I think that would kinda rune it,because it's supposed to be You and your Fiance's wedding.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no no no.  that would be very confusing for guests in terms of gifts.  if they bring one envelope of cash, you and your sis will be fighing over who gets it.  his parents don't pay for your wedding, your parents do.  it's the responsibility of the bride's side to pay for most everything.  the groom's family helps with the rehearsal dinner and honeymoon traditionally.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	That's my date too! Wanna make it a triple wedding! J/k!<br>  <br>  I am open to sharing all other wedding events (I am having  a double bachelorette party with my MOH) but NOT the wedding. That is the one day I want my fiance and I to be the focus.

You can have a perfect beautiful inexpensive wedding if you want to.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I'd say it really depends on the 2 brides.  Can they agree on the colors?  On the centerpieces?  I mean usually this just doesn't work.  The brides family usually pays and unless they are sisters and their parents are the same, feuds can break out over this kind of stuff.<br>  <br>  It seems like a really bad idea.  Who goes first?  After all people can't watch both brides walk down the aisle at the same time.<br>  <br>  It can happen--but it's just extremely rare and it seems like the fights this could generate (not to mention the strain on guests who have to make sure they spend the same amount on both girls which means you are likely to get a lot less since that's twice as much money being shelled out the same month) could really be far far far more trouble than it's worth.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i think it's tacky. everyone else gets their own special day, why not you, and your fsil????  yes, i would protest the double, but please don't quibble the other couple over wanting to rush their event before yours.<br>  <br>  talk to your fsil and between the 2 of you do some research into saving on the costs.  see where each of you is willing and able to compromise so that the parents will see how serious you both are about this (i would assume she probably won't want to share her day, either) and show them how you can both have your own day without sending them to bankruptcy court.<br>  <br>  good luck!!  my best wishes to both of you!|`|0n2tpS1oaa	well. i see how expensewise it'd make sense but i mean, that would just make it so impersonal. your wedding day should be all about 2 people coming together to celebrate spending the rest of their lives together with family and friends. and it wouldn't be about only u 2, it'd be about the 4 of u....<br>  <br>  idk. i jsut dont think it'd seem that special
cyFqjkolaa	arrgghhhhh...........I am sorry and will vent here as my wife can drive me nuts as well.<br>  <br>  Things do slow down after knowing each other for a time.  Whether tired or whatever.  BUT I will ask and not receive and then after a few times get a little pissy and then she will give in.<br>  <br>  The lesson learned here--If I am pissy I get sex.   HMMMMMMM<br>  <br>  Pavlov proved that it becomes a conditioned response.  So knowing this how about we are helpful around the house, cooked dinner, were just great in some fashion, and you make us breathless.  After a time the conditioning becomes that for good behavior there is more fun. <br>  <br>  My wife says that she will not be held hostage to sex.  I agree.  But by the same token why should I be hostage to no sex.<br>  <br>  Think it over.  Feel free to disagree.  Love to hash it out.  And learn as well|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	There's sex after marriage?  Who knew.

I showed him things he had never experienced before. Let him do things he had only dreamed of."<br>  <br>  You seem to think you are some kind of hero and thus he "owes you" for something.  Like, you used to put out like nuts and therefore he should be ok without geting it so much anymore.<br>  <br>  You have pulled a **CLASSIC** bait and switch here.  When you first got together, you were a sex machine.  He married you.  Now you are not.  And he is complaining.  Why shouldn't he?<br>  <br>  If, when you were first together, he always held the door for you, got you flowers, complimented you, etc, and then ditched it all once you were married, you'd be upset.  Same deal.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	This is NOT the same question that was posted for the women.  I find it interesting that you added more details to the version posted for the men.<br>  <br>  And Honey, you're weak if he can "guilt" you into sex when you BOTH chose not to do it it the previous day.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Well, dangit.  Last time you asked, for women only, I told you to re-read Allison's answer since she was a woman and maybe you'd listen to her.  But here she is beating me to the punch again.  I agree with her - "bait and switch" sums up what you did quite nicely.
D2bx76kJaa	If you can communicate with him so well just come out with it and ask him. What would be the harm? The worst thing is that he really is dating someone out of the circle and he is going very slowly with her and he might know that you have a tiny crush on him so that is why he does not mention it. or he could be lying but why would you lie about that on face book? Either way you should ask him if he is single. If he is seeing someone you should stop flirting.Good luck|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Well him never mentioning her might have something to do with the fact that he likes getting attention from you. You've asked everyone else in your group so you might as well go ahead and ask him.  If he has a gf then it's not ok to be flirting with him.|`|GBr9YngTaa	It's not okay to continue flirting until you know for certain he does not have a girlfriend. The only way to get past the rumors is to ask him yourself. If he doesn't, than that might be your chance for some alone time with him.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	i would be wary until i knew for sure. ask him what's up with the status change...if he hesitates or seems uncomfortable you've got your answer. dont speculate, just ask him straight up. this shouldnt be a problem if you too have great chemistry. good luck!!!|`|1JtnI4SEaa	Ask him if he has a girlfriend. If he says yes, tone back the flirting. If he says no, them keep doing what you are doing.|`|I7OZ4glFaa	well u should ask him and if he doesn't say anything then maybe he jsut hiding something and not interested and maybe he just looking for a good friend to talk to|`|brKp7aF6aa	you should ask him about it. you don't ever want to be the girl who is known for messing with other people boyfriends. that is not a good reputation to have.

urNgcpiBaa	I had the same thing happen to me once!  It went away after a bit, but still, it was horrible.  Your not alone!
2SSD6BP9aa	Use something penis-shaped to practice on, like a carrot, hot dog, or whatever.  As long as it doesn't have any sharp edges or anything like that.<br>  <br>  Push it back into your mouth until you start to gag.  Hold it there until the gagging passes.  Then try pushing it a bit further until the gagging starts again.  Keep repeating this.  If it gets to be too much, take a break before starting again.  Practice every day and eventually you will be able to take it all the way to the back of your throat without gagging.  Or maybe just a little bit as you're getting used to it.<br>  <br>  When you can take it to the back of your throat, the next step is to swallow as if it was food back there, so you can take the end of it into your actual throat.  It helps if what you are practicing on is a little bit flexible.<br>  <br>  Not all guys are long enough to actually get into your throat like that.  But if you can do it to him, then keep up with the swallowing motions while his penis is in your throat.  It will feel to him like your throat muscles are milking his penis.<br>  <br>  Just remember to keep coming up for air!|`|QSodlfMraa	practice on something the size of your boyfriend|`|2OVnLICdaa	I just answered a question like this. So I'll give you the same advice.<br>  <br>  The general consensus is that you should try a hundred and one different methods and techniques to avoid gagging. The "method", so to speak, that is mostly never considered is the most basic.<br>  <br>  By that, I mean simply forcing it down. Yes, it's likely that you might gag. But a little known secret is that a lot of guys like the gagging, they find it to be a turn on during deep throat, it's just one of those things most feel a little shy of telling girls. You can take my word for it that gagging is harmless, and it's true that you can get used to the sensation fairly quickly...<br>  <br>  So once gagging is no longer an obstacle, but an established turn on, it makes the whole thing easier for you and more enjoyable for you both. This eventually leads to a level of trust, where the guy can enjoy "guiding" the deep throating itself, and a demanded increase in pace or depth becomes more easy for you to adjust to, (see "rough deep throat") I guess, it can be quite easy and trust me that is something he will love. What seemed difficult or impossible, suddenly is easy and quite enjoyable for you both.<br>  <br>  May not be a popular view, but just trust me on this.|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	They sell creams and sprays at adult stores that numb the back of your throat to prevent you from gagging.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	I can show you better then I can tell you.|`|psMZrXa7aa	I can teach you. <br>  <br>  But i'm not cheap.|`|Krv4z6VEaa	All right fellas. Knock it off! (just a pun)<br>  <br>  To answer ur question girlfriend, practice makes perfect. There r guys I've been able to do that 2, and then guys that were just 2 well-endowed 4 me 2 go there. (like my very significant other)  U don't have 2 go all the way down on a guy to get him off. They r most sensitive right below the head of their.....uh......u know. Itz all about technique & practice. Swirl ur tongue (mine's pierced) slowly around the head and u'll drive him wild!

I've got no idea if it works or not, some girls have a gag reflex and some don't really.|`|5VgUE6ATaa	i guess all i can say like everyone else is to practice.either on him or on other things.but if you practice on him  start off slow.you don't need to deep throat him at first.just work your way and you'll soon get it.|`|7WiGqq0uaa	Hide in a dark parking garage with a trenchcoat, say "follow the money" to a couple of reporters, and seriously mess up Nixon's day.|`|27d55f423ea3b282ca812b1d675dd25aaa	LAY ON YOUR BACK ON BED HEAD HANGING OVER EDGE  LET HIM ENTER YOU WHEN HE IS OFF THE BED TRY THIS IT WORKED FOR ME HEY ME 65   GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY LOL|`|cfFlf1EAaa	Just watch a porn|`|4AavBJy8aa	practice makes perfect  your bf will love it :)|`|PXN7r0RRaa	when ur done with me... go to him|`|72f2329713aaf1367f559e2d98aad351aa	in my religion no problem with it, what matters is the Legal issues, you have to have marriage certificate first then you can go as deeeep as you can
zCE0slQ5aa	custom dictates that the man initiate this by a gesture of promise.<br>  a gift, piece of jewelry or verbal announcement to you. of course the woman can take the initiative too.<br>  <br>  the moment before you reach a level of intimacy that will endear your heart to him is the moment you should have the talk. the same should hold true for both of you.<br>  <br>  it can easily go too far without proper communication and this is when people get hurt.<br>  <br>  as a rule, no exclusivity, no intimacy. no one gets hurt this way.

AA11315360	Dont respond back to him. He doesnt want a relationship with you so if you keep texting him he will just think you are annoying or crazy. Men like to throw the term crazy around a lot. <br>  <br>  Sometimes if you leave a guy totally alone for weeks then he may come back to you once he sees you respected him and left him alone for a while. However if he doesnt call you in a few weeks then it is just completely over and dont ever call him again.<br>  Dont text or call him or email him ever again. If you have a chance of getting back together then HE has to make the first contact.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	Be friends for now...take it slow.......be the best friend he ever had and most likely things will rekindle. I don't mean friends w/ benefits, although he might like that lol. But if emotions are involved something will happen between a guy and a girl. Keep contact but don't distance yourself too much. In the meantime work on yourself and make yourself into that ideal girlfriend- improve anything that you may need to about yourself, stay CONFIDENT and work it.

It turned out he was only decieving me into thinking he wanted to continue our relationship, but was unsure. But the real reason he was doing that was because he was seeing another girl on the side, and wanted to make sure I stuck around in case that didnt work out for him. Not saying your ex is doing the same, but dont let him play games with you. Either he wants to make it work, or he doesnt. There should be no "I think I want to be alone" That's pretty much saying "I dont want to get back together, so i'll say it in a way that wont hurt your feelings"in my opinion ...I personally wouldnt text him back, and just wait until he texts you again. If you do, then say something like "ok I understand." If he wants to get back with you, he will. Just let him come to you.|`|4EWCegiRaa	So he doesn't want to date and you don't want to be friends... there's nothing else so don't force it.

We were attracted to each other from the moment we were introduced to each other, basically, but I wanted to be sure about his intentions before I gave in to anything. I wanted to know him first before I came clean about my feelings. I'd been hurt a lot before. Eventually we were watching a movie together (we share a passion for film) and he quite suddenly came clean and said he thought it was best if we weren't friends anymore because he had feelings for me. So yeah that's where it took off.

Honestly...). We talked for like two seconds before I had to run off. But, the next day, I went to the park again, and he was there, in the exact same spot. So I talked to him for longer. This went on for about four days until it started raining while we were there, and he offered to let me go to his house to wait for the rain to stop. Which I did. As it turns out, it was only a shower, but as I get ready to head off home, he blurts out that he would like it if I would go out with him. And voilà!<br>  <br>  3= Erm...well...7 months altogether.

It doesn't sound like you're ready to get married if you had a break up in the last 12 months.  You should seriously wait.|`|2S2onP86aa	I know you want a guy's answer. But your story, I can totally relate to it. My boyfriend is out of town now - for a month and a half - and there was this stupid girl, and she KNOWS he has a girlfriend, but she kept playing with his head and trying to make me look shallow and not worth it, though she doesn't even KNOW me or my name or even met me. Nothing of that. Til he suddenly changed on me and stuff. I got so upset and I knew it's all because of that b*tch who was coming in between to ruin things between us. I sent her a Facebook message and she didn't stop. She sent him a msg on Facebook as well. It was very long like an essay - and she just want to have future with him and crap (I mean come one, she only knew him for a few weeks or something). I got totally upset. Anyway, my boyfriend got back to his sanity and finally told her to leave us alone (in a polite way, cos he is just as nice as your guy probably which it's not so cool when it comes to this). Also, she sent me a message acting all nice and innocent telling me why do I have to stay with him after all he's done? I ignored her and told my guy about it instantly to take actions. <br>  <br>  So I'm telling you - send her an email and see how she reponse to it. If he does stupid thing and tries to provoke you, ignore every message and just tell your boyfriend to take actions. Do not ever let her get to you. Becaue eventually your boyfriend is not hiding it anymore and he's being faithful which it's a good thing. Most guys have flings. And even when he cheats, sometimes it doesn't mean he doesn't love you. The guys mind is just .. hard to understand sometimes.<br>  <br>  Good luck gorgeous - hope I helped. ?|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	umm, first off, he should have no reason to be mad, only you should, and second, he needs to grow a pair and have the initiative to tell this girl to back off on his own, but, if it comes down to you have to do it, go ahead, he has no reason to get mad about it|`|PXN7r0RRaa	if u think thas bad.. check this out... my female manager.. at work... was undressing me with her eyes.. at work.. she did it twice.. while biting her lips... like she wanted to do things to me or something... and she had a ''Fiancee''|`|WLXzsmqbaa	Definitely not good. If I were him I'd get my number changed. Hope this helps.|`|U4dHE6Kwaa	No it wouldnt make me mad at all! Id probably thank you for getting her off my case :D|`|Idg2ME9Caa	DO IT! this girls is ANNOYING! hes trying to get rid of her! so help him Finish|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	go for it. maybe your man will love you more|`|2UqJ8Z7Baa	if  your man dont mind, just do it. somehow that ***** must understand
wia9SXCPaa	I have a bit of experience here for your.  As a cheater and as the one being cheated on.  First when I cheated it was because I was mad at my husband and lacking self esteem.  The right (wrong guy in the end) came along and made me feel like a queen.  I never fell in love with him because of the guilt I had for what I did.  It was short lived.  When my husband cheated on me for 2 1/2 years he came to me to tell me because he was in love with her.  I questioned this because when you cheat it is entirely different.  The relationship is untainted with responsibility.  You don't have to worry about day to day things like paying bills and the kids etc.  They had it all and I really thought he would leave me for her.  I sent him to her thinking it was over.  He came back to me and told me he still loved her but not in the same way as he had always and still did love me.  He had all those memories with her and yet they weren't as real as what he had at home.<br>  <br>  I've researched this and most of what I read shows that the new person is just that "NEW" That's where the euphoria comes from.  Of the people out there cheating I read that about 2% will actually make it if they get together as the result of an affair.  Not the best statistics are they.  Your best bet is to stay with your first love and tell them what your missing.  If they change maybe you end up with the best package after all.  If that doesn't work, then I guess you know what you will have to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think that when a person goes out of the relationship it's because they have already made some emotional disconnect in their relationship, they don't feel that spark anymore.  In going outside of the marriage you are looking for validation as a person and lover.  I don't think love has much to do with it because you don't really search out the person like going through the dating process, you find another lost soul and hook up and feelings may develop because you do hook up but they don't have to really be there before hand.|`|C2GNAmMMaa	Technically you can have feelings for everyone you meet, but if you aren't respectful of your partner's values, chances are it cannot progress or grow to meet all of your needs. Nothing complete comes instantly, it takes time and effort.<br>  <br>  Total Cliché but honesty really is best. Even the Playa gets caught once and awhile, so it's better to think a bit about what you are really gaining or losing before acting on your impulses. You'll respect yourself more in the long run for not playing games with others' hearts.|`|9ZZzEvBFaa	to be completely honest  i think that its really a little bit of both, i know that for me one was nothing like the other.  I had one kind of relationship with one and the complete opposit with the other, in the end i went with the more stable one and i still kinda regret it, but you know thats what life is all about, learning from your mistakes|`|h55xWcyiaa	Which one would make you proud at your parents 50th anniversary (no matter how borring it would be)?, which one would you see with you when he has become old and unattractive? Which one make you laugh? Which one is able to listen to you in a genuine way? and finally which one would you still love if tomorrow he would become crippled?try to answer these questions and you'll know the answer to the first one|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Ive never cheated, but I tend to overcrush even now that I'm married. There were times when I was into two women (not committed to either yet). Yu need to take a few steps back, clear your feeling to understand them, and make a decision on who you really want.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Your still just humping like a monkey.Your to young and to fertile to even worry about it.After your 30 you'll know that you where just young and dumb and full of ***.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	My classmates cheated<br>  --You know that you can write E  mail messages to me  through this section by clicking the word e mail by opening  my  profile|`|41skve2Yaa	You go with your heart.  If it's missing from your relationship, it's love.|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	I am with Jerry E2.
rywgn8HLaa	You should go to theknot.com and get an account with them. They will give you all the information that you will need - including a personalized checklist so you know what needs to get done and when. <br>  <br>  For the wedding you will need a church/ceremony site, an officiant to perform the ceremony, a marriage license, rehearsal dinner site, reception site, caterer, cake, DJ, photographer, videographer (if you choose to have one), transportation, hair/makeup, gown/veil/shoes/jewelry, rings, favors, honeymoon location...<br>  <br>  Usually the ring bearer and flower girl are a little bit younger (around 7 or 8), but I think if you want to include some family members then you could have the 10/11 year olds be the ring bearer/flowergirl.|`|0n2tpS1oaa	yeah usually around 10 or 11, but can be as young as like 5 or 6. <br>  <br>  and um...decoration!! flowers? centerpieces? (my sisters doing really pretty floating candles), ushers (to show ppl to seats), music? (for reception, father/daughter, 1st dance as married couple, etc), CAKE? wedding topper, guestlist, gift bags? tablecloths, photgrapher.....<br>  lol thats all i got now|`|RZKygoPzaa	Well, 10-11 years old is a good age for a ring bearer, as they have a steadier hand than someone 6 years old an probably will not drop the rings.<br>  <br>  You need bouquets for yourself, your bridesmaids, corsages for the mother of the bride and the groom's mother, boutonnieres for the groom, the best man, that father or the bride, the father of the groom, the ushers.<br>  <br>  Are you decorating the church with a couple of baskets of flowers?<br>  <br>  How is the venue being decorated after the wedding ceremony?<br>  <br>  Are you having favors for the guests to take home with them?<br>  <br>  Are you giving gifts to your bridesmaids for being in your wedding?<br>  <br>  Are you having a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding that traditionally includes the wedding party, bride, groom, parents of bride & groom, family membes, bridesmaids, grooms men, etc?<br>  <br>  Transportation, how are you getting to the wedding?<br>  <br>  How is you wedding party being transported tot he church and then the venue after the wedding?  Get the logistics worked out now.  doesn't have to be alimo, but its important you have worked it out with your wedding party.<br>  <br>  Makeup & hair for you and your wedding party?  Having someone do it or you doing it yourselves?<br>  <br>  <br>  Its all about how much money you have to spend, dear.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	I am sorry I can't answer all your questions.  There are too many variables, such as where you live, is is a large/small wedding, etc.<br>  <br>  However, a great place to start (and I used it for my wedding) is TheKnot.com.  Another place to try is locally.  Google your area for what you want and get references if you can for all the major stuff like catering.  I would also look at your daily newspaper (if you have one where you live).  They are usually really good too.<br>  <br>  I would so not use a two year old in your wedding.  Seriously.  They have no clue as to what's going on and why they are there.  You can have an older flower girl if you like.  It's your wedding.<br>  <br>  There is nothing typical with weddings these days.  You can do anything you like.  It is your day and you get to have what you want.<br>  <br>  One more piece of advice, enjoy the day because, before you know it, your first, second, third wedding anniversary will roll around and you will wonder where time has gone.<br>  <br>  Relax and don't stress.  There is a lot of help out there for you.|`|AA11550245	Depends on how much you want to spend?<br>  <br>  Place cards, parking arrangements, Invitations, flowers, undergarments,purse for your wedding, decorations, etc.<br>  Most of all get a wedding planner.  Or get a wedding planner book.  This will help you stay on budget and get an idea on what you want.  <br>  Don't forget the dinner rehearsal etc.  <br>  Good Luck to you<br>  And Congrats.|`|tIg3low2aa	Invitations<br>  Flowers<br>  Punch<br>  Plates, forks, napkins, cups, etc.<br>  tablecloths<br>  bouquet<br>  candles<br>  Priest or Judge<br>  rings<br>  Bride and Grooms glasses<br>  other food<br>  mints and nuts<br>  Favors<br>  Guest Book and pen<br>  The list can go on.....|`|HJ3N7jhgaa	okay so just be clam and let everything be it self like don't be over protect against your weeding just have fun and u have everything for your wedding only thing u need is luck i wish you luck and happy married life =]
HzVR8Wahaa	No, I did not, we had ups and downs in our relationship, It was after I knew him very well and learned what kind of man he truly was, that's when i KNEW I'd spend the rest of my life with him.  And I'm so glad I took the time to get to know him, he's the best husband anyone could ever ask for!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Except for the first part, where you say "before you started dating"...  How on earth would I know that I was going to spend the rest of my life with a man I'd never met yet?  I knew within a few dates that he was the one.  There's no way I would have known that if I hadn't actually dated him...|`|CxRJwJsraa	I met my husband when I was 18, and I right away I thought: he's the one I want to marry. <br>  <br>  Now, it was years later before that happened and there were times in between where I wasn't sure if it would work out. But, in the end, it did. <br>  <br>  However, I would just assume that some guy is the one, based on a feeling. You need to use your heart and your head.|`|CsLyyRQeaa	Before we went on a date, no.  On the first date I knew that he was a one of a kind and that I wanted to be with him.  But every relationship that you think is the one may not be.  My husband and me nearly did not workout do to peoples interference in our relationship.  You have to know the person well before you can know for sure that he is the one.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Uhm no.  My husband and I were set up on a blind date and I didn't even know him.  We had to get to know each other, then decide.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	I knew the moment i saw him he would be mine!!!!!|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I did for sure.  I knew there was something special about him, but I couldn't put my finger on it.|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Well my husband and I both fell in love and knew on our first date so I can't offer you much advice! :)|`|PPBIPEedaa	Oh,yes I knew we would be together forever, not saying it wont be obstacles.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	oh come on.  that was just indigestion.  take some pepto and you'll be fine.
kGBli717aa	Not very respectful of you is he? Tell him anymore of that, he's toast. At church, no less; you should be bugged.
yxtj5LUaaa	Take some meds that make you want to sleep...and just sleep thru it.*|`|4wmbnr3Saa	sorry for you, but Im sure you'll have fun...the excitement of the wedding..|`|JJUZFvggaa	Well I take a shot of Tequila before I have to deal with them or a glass of wine. It takes the edge off. I am not saying get drunk (even thought it might make it much better) but one glass or shot will take the edge off just enough so you can relax. When you start to feel tense again  have another, or excuse your self to the restroom and find a quite corner in the room. If you escape for 5-10 min every hour or so will save your sanity. <br>  <br>  Just remember and keep telling your self it is only a weekend and not every day. I have the opposite problem though, I cant stand my mother & father in law. It also helps me to smile and nod a lot, say the word fine to questions. I am being polite but not rude.
NuUdCz0Laa	I think all families have certain relations that push the boundaries of decency.  I have had several in my family, I was ashamed to introduce them to my friends.  Foul mouthed, rude, smoking red necks, probably described them best, but now that they are gone, I realize how I was probably the stuck up one, because they were just being themselves and being honest.  But to answer your question, just smile and be polite and try to join in when you can.  Have fun.|`|satoCRC6aa	put a smile on your face and hang around people that you enjoy|`|RN1wGlWWaa	With a smile, patience, and a lot of prayer to God to give you what you need to cope :)|`|LbvRxf2jaa	lol I have that problem...<br>  <br>  Just breathe - does your husband know how you feel?  If so just remind him to stick close...and do realize that these people will not care if you disappear outside or to the washroom or whatever for a break...they probably won't even notice.<br>  <br>  Every time you get pissed off (cause the likelyhood is that you will at some point) just remember that it's his family, you accepted them when you married him and for his sake, try to stay calm and sane...<br>  <br>  I guess the best thing is that MAKE SURE you have your own time, and MAKE SURE your husband knows that's what you're doing...keep yourself happy - it's not uf job to keep others happy...esp. not loud obnoxious in-laws (unless you're hosting...which your'e not)<br>  <br>  On another note I LOVE CHICAGO!  Enjoy yourself!!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I don't think it is too much to ask for just one weekend. Part of the time will be taken up with the wedding. For the rest of the time don't be cold and standoffish, try to blend in as much as you can.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Liquor.  Keep some in your purse.|`|rtR3IDBCaa	Why don't you try getting to know them a little better and make the effort to build a familial relationship with them.  I have a great relationship with my husband's extended family, mostly because we have an actual relationship - we don't just tolerate each other.  I think you'll find that they really would like to get to know you given the chance.  Good Luck!|`|uVwPykXlaa	avoid alcohol,smile and laugh at thier bad jokes.<br>  if they offend yu turn a blind eye..<br>  juss count the hours n before yu know it yu'll be back home..<br>  and theyve got less bad things to say abt yu we u leave.<br>  always works 4 me|`|pxygDg7Aaa	Alcohol|`|H3WHxCgaaa	And yet, they are your family too...suck it up buttercup - it's only one day out of your life.|`|7ko9czaaaa	just smile and be your self, you are not marred to them,|`|AA11755944	lots of booze|`|aaCK25mGaa	you cant...trust me!!!!!
vl0HWTDJaa	Yeah, the easiest way to make friends is you just automatically bacome great friends with the people you live with in the first year. Then every friend that any of the people you live with make will become your friends too so it's really easy, you don't even have to try!|`|NpzNHmCGaa	Hey don't worry its two years off. Go to uni with an open mind and you should be fine. Im sure if your going to a general uni which has a wide range of different people you will be fine. Plus if your in halls you more likely than not automatically make friends with some of the people in you live near. Plus there will be people on your course you will probably get on with and clubs you can join where you will be able to make friends. Theres lots of different oppurtunities. Also remember most of the people will be in the same boat as you so will be keen to make new friends.|`|S5FubLOVaa	To start with you have to share a dorm together so its natural to bond with others. so dont worry, relax and be yourself.|`|itMcT95Qaa	i think it is true because there are more people to socialize with xx|`|6a809f8f4c97f768092102e120596872aa	yeah course u will make new friends but not all of them will have exactly the same intrests as u but diffrences of opinion can help make a friendship stronger and last longer
7e4jxj3Daa	Smaller pale ones are the cutest and tastiest.|`|syKIxX45aa	As long as they are prominent , then the size is not a issue. A nice aureole is a thing of beauty.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	They don't care in the least.  As long as they are attached to breasts, and those breasts are attached to a female.  Seriously, the variety of boobs and nips is one of the things that makes people interesting...obviously not the only thing, but YOU asked about nipples.|`|6a15f58c8ab23fab792f2a808a7dd8beaa	t's not nipples that matter..the size of the breasts matter to me...and of course that is at one stage...the ultimate is the goal...lol|`|ScOVQvZEaa	Any, small is good as is big.
eWMn7dhKaa	It could be for any number of reasons, health, stress, opportunity, friendship, marital strife, compassion, business, experience.<br>  <br>  It obviously is working for them, so the answer to your question is yes.  However, as to why would the man that doesn't have to do this - do this?<br>  <br>  The answer I do not have, but it could be listed in my first sentence.  You have to remember that while a year goes by the same rate it did last year, it won't seem like it and soon it will be next year.|`|lNl1bdWXaa	All depending on how long his marriage is. especially since the job is so far away it might just be easier to do so he doesnt have to travel a long distance at night|`|PPBIPEedaa	If your friend likes it, you should love it!|`|paerqxfMaa	Sure it works - 1 1/2 hour back and forth - 3 hours a day travel - and that's on good days - no bad weather, no accidents, etc.  I don't know that I would want to commute that time each day.  It is evidently working for them - and I do know of a few others that it works for.|`|AA10861417	On the negative side - one would think he has another woman. <br>  <br>  On the positive side - based on his work - if he has clients to see or meetings to attend daily, this may be his best alternative.    He may not like rush hour driving or a medical reason he can't be in the car that long.   <br>  <br>  Now when he retires - he SHOULD move back home with his wife.  No questions asked there.
LxfqUaaIaa	He's probably just shy. Try just smiling at him the next time you see him or wait for him to put the greeting out there first. He might want to be friends but finds it hard to communicate well.|`|zzUgYFy4aa	if you are married why are you bothering this poor classmate.<br>  <br>  you sound like a BULLY!<br>  <br>  leave them alone and go about your day<br>  <br>  why would you want to continue to harrass someone
W6pT1Wp3aa	I love the fact that my boyfriend is always willing to take me places and lives showing me off. He never says anything bad about me even when I am acting crazy or weird. He's always there for me no matter what and he listens to everything I have to say. My boyfriend really is amazing and I would never let him go.
ZYc3OEHuaa	i say go to the mall and walk around...bond together<br>  (aka:momo)|`|D2M8DvcLaa	I always like the park and flying a Baby Bat kite or two, then a picnic lunch. Try to find a park that has a nice view. If you live near a beach, that is a great place to go as well. Always bring a ball to play whatever as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
BaNrweQ4aa	just proves that you shouldn't always move in with your closest friends - because it starts to ruin things, and you start to find out you are completely different after all :) nothing you could have do but moving in with someone you know a little about, for the money - is better than risking friendships and things. you weren't to know :) people act different when they are with their friends aswell, so there you go - just be careful who you think are your friends, and how you can actually trust. you cannot always tell; you just have to go with your instincts :)|`|YxFDiEaCaa	You never know what anyone is really like until you live with them, same goes with boyfriends.|`|3klcE6Gjaa	I really don't think it's possible to see if someone is a good living mate or not unless you live with them :)!  Sort of why I support cohabitation!<br>  <br>  I've had a bunch of roommates, and you really never know until you live with them.  The safest thing is to actively discuss your living policies before you move in together, and automatically set up ground rules before anyone strays too far.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|UQUxKInOaa	i kinda had a sameis h problem though mine didnt manifest as i did nt allow it too. What i did was organise a kinda trip for about 3-4 days weekend nt enuff with potential housemates to another country and tht was like a test. it most probs has to be abroad cos ull need to see how they are completely out of their comfort zone and this helped me to make a decision <br>  <br>  hope this helps though im sure u were just very unlucky with tht housemate|`|hinPfju4aa	Never move in with friends, you won't be friends after it.|`|f5c840d7deb2bdbef3fa8b152ae928adaa	When you move in with someone you learn a lot about them that can make you like or dislike them more! I moved in with a couple of friends and the one I was closer to turned out to be an a**hole and the one I didn't really know has become one of my closest friends.  You can't really tell what someone is going to be like when you live together so it's a case of trial and error.  That being said it's nicer to move in with friends (however they turn out) than strangers.
n8rrXke1aa	First of all you don't need those kind of mates who are into weed, locked up or don't want to chill and be there with you !! As you don't want to find yourself ending up in their situation anytime soon, as that would be more for you to deal with !!! <br>  <br>  A girlfriend i'm sure you would find nice as company and you will be surprised as to what girls wouldn't mind being with you, they would be the nicest kind as they would want to be with you as they like you for you !<br>  <br>  Yes you might get a bit depressed, have been there myself when I have been stuck in the house for months on end with what felt like nothing to do, but as I found out there is always something. You have to find the positive side of everything or you will just get more depressed. <br>  <br>  Take it as a chance to do things you have wanted to do but never had the time, and there will be lots of things (nothing sporty tho lol) you could learn a new language for when you go on holiday, learn to play an instrument , play a game have a few movie marathons with popcorn obviously :) then if its sunny sit outside get a tan and appreciate the little things in life (personally i love ladybirds the most !). <br>  <br>  For friend company talk to your doctors for a support group maybe <br>  <br>  good luck|`|QvhPJAKyaa	u just need to get out there & find some friends seriously. its not really that hard if u put ur mind to it, u just gotta be friendly. go out one night and just start talking to people. otherwise u've got no hope.|`|jeLehwmpaa	dude i feel tghe same way my sister just left for bootcamp and we were so close i am so alone i hate my father and my brother is never around my mom has just started school again so if you feel lonly just talk to me not only will it cheer you up to have someone to talk to but it will cheer me up to
hTT8DhYfaa	of course its you!!!!<br>  <br>  dont worry if it doesnt work out, cuz u are best friends and it will go back to that. but of course he LOVES you!! he just doesnt know what to do... knowing you for so long, he finally realizes what LOVE is!<br>  <br>  awwww!! lucky!<br>  <br>  best wishes.<br>  remember. no matter what. wait til your wedding day .. haha just kidding. i hope you wont go that far :op
lUNciXaKaa	I feel for your son. I see my sons every other week and the off weeks just kill me because I miss them so much. Your son's father needs to get his act together and at least call his son everyday. I suggest you find out whether he intends on being a father at all to his son. That being said, he might be going through something that he might need help with. A civil conversation can go a long way, an approach without yelling, blaming, or anger can help you both reach a level of civility good for all of you. Your son deserves a father who wants to be involved everyday. I hope this helps. You, your son and his father will be in my thoughts.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	Yes cut him out he doesnt want to be a dad and that is the most painful thing for your son to realize you will have to pick out male role models for your son to look up to and you are the most important you are mom and he loves you more than anything|`|W8R0FrROaa	hello Mellisa,<br>  I understand your position and I feel for your son. I would never abandon my children cos they are a part of me and i love them all, 2 daughters and a son 32,29, 24 respectively, me and their mother drifted apart a very long time ago and although I am judged as the "bad guy" in family matters I still get turned too, when I am needed, my wife was most explicit in her terms for that, so if you sons father ain't interested, then build your sons life into something special with you.it will be his loss, not your sons,<br>  good luck mel, I hope it all comes together for you both|`|ycPz8K8jaa	Sad to say that if his son was his first priority in life right now, he'd be around.  It looks like he'll have to come around on his own.  Don't cut him out of your life, because he may one day see the error in his ways and try to fix the relationship with his son.  Until then, you've done what you can.  Trying to force him into your son's life will only make your son feel worse when he sees his father REALLY reject him.  Be open and honest with your son about this, too.  I'm sure he knows that you have tried your best with the situation and he will love you even more for that.<br>  <br>  Take a peek at my question:  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309104244AAu7Gwe&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|adcCJrNxaa	You cannot make someone see someone if they do not want too. Cleary he has no interest in being in his son's life. Just like your son saw how his father was and stopped asking maybe you should do the same. If he wants to spend time with his son let him call and say he coming to pick him up. You're forcing the issue and we know what happens when we are forced to do things, right? If he wants to talk to his son let the father buy his own cell phone to show his interest. You have done more than enough as his mother but you don't/shouldn't have to do any of those things. Let the father go...its his loss really!|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	have you ever heard the old saying about beating a dead horse?<br>   That is what you are doing <br>    Stop doing anything and go on with your life after all the boy has|`|xBd96wvRaa	Yes cut him out. <br>  <br>  It is better then scraping the scab off your sons wound only to reopen it again later.
6ZHAzrA0aa	Well... You can't really put an age on it... I never expected to be engaged at 18... I'd say at least be moved out of your parents place, be sure you are in love and never want anyone else, have at least 1 year engagement before marriage (if you are young, longer) and hopefully you'll be ok.<br>  <br>  ? Taylor|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	20 or older.|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	Although I would say there is no "right" age to get engaged I don't think it should happen much before 25 years old.  What you want when you are 18 or 20 is very different than what you are looking for when you are older.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	The right age is when both partners are ready to take on financial and emotional responsibilities. I'm planning on being engaged around 19/20. That being said, I'm way more mature than most people I know.|`|tpSSka4taa	When you are appy and ready! ive know people be engaged at 16 or 50!!! Its upto you...personally id like to get engaged to my boyfriend when im still in my 20's. but thats a personal choice!|`|ZKw46efXaa	i dont think age comes into it! just when you find the right person!|`|YjoFsZuyaa	i was engaged at 20, but it wasnt until we lived together i realised how much he disresepcted me .... he was a year older but mentally still a teenager.<br>  <br>  Age doesnt matter as to coming to getting engaged, but i think if you get engaged when you are young to ensur you have a long enagagment so you are together and know everything about each other and have lived together.<br>  <br>  I was engaged for 3 years but left the relationship last year. I bagan to realise that he wasnt the guy i wanted to spend my life with, he was lazy, inconsiderate, disrespectful etc etc<br>  <br>  Now I have found the man of my dreams, not engaged, but we know we want to marry each other but we will when the time comes but there is no rush, as long as you appreciate the relationship you have and that it is solid, no rush to get engaged.|`|x5avs3gnaa	It depends, I think, on the maturity levels of the people getting engaged. Also, it depends on if either of the people have other things they want to do before getting married (getting a career, going on an adventure of some kind, etc). Age should not be terribly important (assuming you are old enough to get married in the first place), but it should be looked at as far as maturity and life experience because those will both play a factor in how the marriage works or does not work. Good luck.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Age DOES matter. You will see the majority of people who think it doesn't matter are young. I don't think people should worry about being married until they are in their mid 20's. At that point you will have established yourself as a person and will be more knowledgeable on what you want out of a relationship and a long term marriage. I'm not saying don't fall in love young, just don't get married in the prime of your life. I found the man of my dream when I was 21 but was and still am in no hurry to run to the alter. We have been together for almost 4 years now and still not engaged. I have many friends that have been w/ their bf's for 5-7 years and still not engaged. doesn't mean they don't love each other any less. If you find the guy its ok to be together and if you feel engagement is in the works that's fine too if you have a long engagement. Its been studied that people who marry before they are 25 are twice more likely to divorce than people who waited and were more mature.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I don't think there's really a "right" age.  It all depends on how long it takes you to find the person you want to marry, how financially stable you are, how mature you are, etc.  Some people are ready to get engaged when they're 18, others are still nowhere ready when they're 45.  I think most people are ready for marriage by their mid-to-late twenties, though.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I always said I'd never get married before I can legally participate in the champage toast. I also planned on having a one year engagement. So, I guess 20 would be the youngest? Truth is, there is no "right age" for an engagement, but I wouldn't plan a wedding until you are finacially able to afford it, and emotionally ready to commit to one person for, well, forever!|`|nPa5QFOeaa	i think age does matter. if at 15 you decide to get engaged i dont think anybody would take you seriously. but if you get engaged at 23 they would. <br>  <br>  as ong as your happy then thats all that matters but to be taken seriously then about 21+|`|AA11451457	When youre both ready to make a lifelong committment.

If you ask me, I don't think this friend of yours is really your friend...<br>  <br>  Good luck =]]
hkwBR1moaa	You'll never know if you don't ask him or tell him how you feel.  If you like him, go for it.  From what you've typed, it does sound like you're trying too hard.  I understand you don't want to face rejection but sometimes that's the only way. So call him up, invite him over, and tell him!|`|kxmxJXEGaa	Maybe he is tired of the games.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you treat him like he is special then you throw cold water on him and treat him like your brother.<br>  <br>  Maybe he found someone who knew what they wanted. If you don't know - we sure don't.<br>  <br>  Be honest with him and see what happens. Even if he is not interested, you know and can move on.|`|AA10593529	You have to just tell him how you feel. You will never know until you ask.|`|c557962d6a854ff2cc7301fd9fdb144baa	Well i think you might be reading to much into this<br>  if he didn't answer when you were chatting online to him it might be because he just got off or maybe he was just really busy<br>  it sounds like he likes you and i know you like him so the best thing to do would talk to him and see if he likes you<br>  don't be afraid just take it head on and what happens happens..<br>  <br>  hope i helped
VuGPufs4aa	dear: enough talk with him get to thee very point thats how i was growed up. wink..wink.
T4N6a7MQaa	You've certainly got the right idea. At least let him know you had a good time and really enjoyed his company. Guys are looking for clues just like women do. If you do or say nothing he might assume you aren't at all interested. It's a silly game but that's the way love is! Good luck.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Being married and divorced> The single guys will not do what your accustom to and they are not predictable> If you had a nice time and so did he let him make the move as if he doesn't than you haven't made yourself look desperate>>Don't jump at the first smiling face find what you need to be happy and wait till you find it as excepting anything less you will repeat the same as what you just got out of> Just My Thought>|`|tsBL19qzaa	First don't play any stupid a** games! If you are interested, you let him know. Send him an email stating how you liked the date, blah, blah, blah, and that it would great to get together again in the future. If he's interested, he'll contact you. If he isn't, he may or may not reply back, in which case you forget about him and move on.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Give it a few days if you haven't heard from him give him a call.|`|uVwPykXlaa	let him chase yu..if yu call him 1st,he will have the upper hand..|`|6PfJXI7iaa	It depends on how you communicated before the date.. If both of you emailed frequently before then I would send an email saying something like I'm thinking about you or I had a really nice time or whatever just to let him know that you are interested.  I would even do it a day or two after the date, why wait?|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	I would wait a day or two.  If he has not initiated contact then you should let your date know by saying something like "hey I had a great time last night. Would you care to go to dinner next week".  Or something along those lines and wait to see what happens. If still no response, then you'll know he's not interested and its time to move on.|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	first thing...guys can not read signals to save their lifes. do  not talk about your ex or your previous marriage on the first date or the second unless he asks you any questions this could scare him off. when it gets close to the end and youve had a good time you should just simply say "we should do this again sometime" & see what he says. its really hard to tell if a guys had a good time of not. they are very complicated. lol. good luck!|`|hinPfju4aa	Waiting is the best thing to do, a man likes when a woman has a life. So do not call him, wait for him to call.|`|tdulyzXXaa	If you are interested - don't wait. And don't try to read his mind. if you contact him and he doesn't suggest a follow-up date, then you have your answer.|`|3fwJBhJdaa	Well don't sleep with them. Maybe a peck on the cheek.|`|aaCK25mGaa	a kiss and another date|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	Did you put out?|`|ca7542594b89a18dd875dc5253650b82aa	Well I would say that he is not interested if he has not called you! I normally follow up on my dates with a phone call. sort of get a feel see if she is interested in second but...<br>  Or he like to play the game hard to get not unusual these days. It is played by both sides. I personally do not like it so I quit the local dating.|`|hjAsZP22aa	Just take things slow be yourself but try to avoid being pushy. Wait for him and see if he calls if he does not you can call and depend on how he sounds in his voice you will know.  I usually be myself and straight up I don't go around the corner|`|EhfGorc9aa	At the time of the date, when you said your thank you's and good-nights, if it truly went well, he would have asked you then when he could see you again. He would have made arrangements then for a 2nd date. If he said he would "call you." don't expect a call, or he may call but feelings may not be strong.   If he said nothing, then don't expect to hear from him and GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE.   The ball is in his court to contact you if he thought it went well.  Sometimes if you think it went well, does not mean that he felt the same way.  He may be serial dating, and who knows what is going on in his life.  I highly recommend the book "Act like a Lady, Think like a Man" by Steve Harvey:  What Men really think about love, relationships, intimacy, and commitment."  I just found it at the bookstore and I even learned a lot I didn't know!  Good luck and HAVE FUN and make NEW friends.  Let that be your focus. Mr. Harvey recommends a "90 day rule" probationary period too.

8oG3Jsk4aa	1. Foreplay <br>  2. Oral Sex <br>  3. Sexual positions <br>  4. Mental Stimulation<br>  Finally,if you show passion, consideration, desire and communicate, then he will appreciate it and know how you want to be pleased.

I mean, I wouldn't want to be knocked up all the time, but since having a kid, I'd really like a man to be around.|`|qkzRbtoWaa	I would choose c be completely independent of all oppressive situations where I can't do exactly what i want with my life and still being dependent on myself personally the whole question employs that you need a male in some way to be happy. but everyone chooses the price they choose to pay however I have done the house wife and the career chicky thing and I must say when i was loved and supported and paid for I didn't nearly appreciate it as I did my independence.dam me for being a free thinker.|`|Idg2ME9Caa	I would rather be the house wife because that guy sounds like a family kind of guy.|`|u1riGDuLaa	i think if your still worried about clubbin money then you dont need to marry either one. I would marry the one that wants me to stay home for the simple fact that he appears to be the confident one. He is secure enough in his own self that he can support you while the other one needs you to help support him? I dont think so|`|R6YQOKitaa	Housewife, but without the kids!<br>  Ah, what a life.<br>  :)|`|gs2aPltGaa	Its up to what you want my dear.<br>  <br>  I have had the pleasure of being both a house wife and a career wife.<br>  <br>  Although I love my career and I am damn good at it, just being in the office,meeting deadlines and goals, the quick drink after work with fellow coworkers, my own free time away from the house and children... ahhh the joys... I do miss it.<br>  <br>  but i am now laid off due to the economy but thats ok because I also just had a baby. so being home made sense... I do love being home but I dont think I can do it forever... i find myself out of social contact... all my friends work so its not like i can call them up and talk for hours. so i feel socially deprived.... i sit in my pajamas all day, i clean the house, i watch tv. i take care of the baby... and i glance at the clock waiting for my fiance to come home... and an hour before he is due home i spend that hour dolling myself up, after that i wait to hear his car pull up eager for adult talk. eager to hear about his day.<br>  <br>  so all in all.... i miss being at work... all i have to talk to him about is how my day was and what the baby did. and bless his soul he listens to my boring day. in return i listen to what drama unfolded at his work place. its a give take situation.<br>  <br>  think carefully.|`|a1047df8eaf57233aa908f5f190b4011aa	I'd pick neither.

I was a stay at home Mom (which BTW is much harder or equal to TWO full time jobs) for about 10 years. Almost 2 years ago when my youngest went to school full time, I went back to work and fortunately landed an amazing job with an amazing group of people and am loving it! There is so much more to consider than this anyway. You have to be compatible on so many more levels that just career and children, although that is HUGE but if you don't love him or he doesn't treat you right, all of the $ in the world isn't going to keep you happy. Staying at home with your kids can be very satisfying and amazing for some women although it is very tiring and you should have a good sense of self, as well as outlets where you can go and socialize with grown ups! LOL! and it just isn't right for some women. I have a couple of friends that just aren't SAHM material. On the other hand, if you are meant to be a SAHM, and you are forced into being a career woman, you can end up completely miserable there as well & seriously resent your husband for it. It is much more about you and who you are and what you want. I am sure you will get a very mixed review on here because we are all different. I would also like to mention that if your plan/desire is to be out in the clubs and what not every night, you really shouldn't have kids yet. Either way, you won't/shouldn't be partying every night with kids at home.|`|9d20b0d4d57fd02b80ab1bb8c1dd88a9aa	What about you figure out what you want? I dont care if my husband was a millionaire. I couldnt stay home. Figure out what you want out of life. What would be most fulfilling for you. Dont let a husbands decision run your life.|`|vJSzDuTiaa	I'd rather be the housewife and when the kids where older start my own thing rather then work full time and raise a family its hard!!|`|i0j21gbFaa	A working wife, that way, if you did have a change at heart and wanted to take some time off for your children you could do...<br>  <br>  I would rather be a career women.. hope that helps...|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I wanted to be a housewife and I am a housewife.  I wouldn't want to go to shows and clubs every day though...|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	I could never be a housewife ugh. No offense to all the little wifeys out there.

(assuming he his protecting himself from becoming a father).<br>  <br>  I would not have children with someone that didn't want children.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Two or three things came to mind. One is that child birth is no longer agony unless you choose not to have an epidural.   Having a child is a life altering event. Which brings me to my next thought, I would never impose this life altering event on my husband or children.......what kind of life would they have with a father who didn't want them. Unless he had a drastic change of mind he would leave eventually. The last thing is if having children means that much to you and nothing to your husband, why don't you get a divorce and marry a man who does want children. You have a choice to make, so make the one that suits you best.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I operate that the decision to have children needs to be a unanimous decision between the  husband and the wife.  So, if my husband did not want children, I would not have children.<br>  <br>  Although truth be told, I would have found out where he stood on this issue while we were dating. If we were at odds, I would have broken up with him....even if I loooooooooved him.|`|b26NgqOFaa	I don't think it is a good idea to have kids if your spouse doesn't want them.<br>  But if you are insisting- the pain is really a tiny fragment of the whole experience of being a mother. And it has its ups and downs.<br>  I think kids need two involved parents if you are going into it intentionally though.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	No. I, personally, have always known I want children one day. So I wouldn't marry a man who didn't ever want any. This is the kind of thing you have to find out before you marry.|`|HOjwnpmUaa	I wouldn't have married the guy in the first place. I think that's one of the stuff you discuss before you get married.<br>  <br>  But, being already married... I guess I'd get pregnant and if he still didn't love the child after it was born, then get divorced. No need to make yourself miserable by not having a child, or him by having a child that he didn't want, or the child itself - by having a daddy that surely didn't want him.|`|Ff6HLBxdaa	A person who doesn't want children isn't selfish it's just a personal choice.<br>  But what ever happens your not going to like it.<br>  Either you put up with it becuase you love the person so much or you have to be strong enough to put your need for a child ahead of your realtionship and leave your spouse.<br>  Shouldn't this have been a conversation before you got married though.|`|cP03k3cXaa	Ask yourself, is that the type of parent you would want for your child? Parents raise the leaders of tomorrow, so what you offer a child now, has an eternal effect on the future of tomorrow. <br>  <br>  FAIRFAX, VA - Caring for children is not a women's issue, or a feminist issue or an employment issue - it's an issue critically important to all people - it is our very future. It is time to focus on children's needs for generous amounts of nurturing, and time to recognize that parents are children's primary nurturers from infancy through the teen years. Since its founding in 1984, the grassroots nonprofit organization Mothers At Home has been supporting parents who care for their own children. This Mother's Day, it is pleased to announce its new name: Family and Home Network. <br>  <br>  Family and Home Network will continue to support and advocate for at-home mothers, and with its new name is acknowledging its focus on the needs of children and strengthening its efforts to be inclusive of all parents who spend generous amounts of time with their children. In addition, Family and Home Network wants to acknowledge the often-overlooked contributions of parents who are employed full-time in order to make it possible for their children to have an at-home parent - these couples share a deep commitment to their children as well as respect for each others' work. <br>  <br>  There are many creative and courageous ways couples as well as single parents fulfill income-earning and caregiving responsibilities so they can maximize the amount of time their children spend in parental care. These include at-home mothers and fathers, parents who work part-time, those who work different shifts (tag team parents) and those with home-based businesses. All of these parents deserve support equivalent to that offered parents who use paid child care - support offered by federal and state governments as well as employers in the form of information and financial subsidies for the care of children. <br>  <br>  "it's time to recognize that ‘quality child care' is provided every day by parents - discussions of how government and businesses can support families must include the needs of those who do not pay others to care for their children," says Cathy Myers, Executive Director of Family and Home Network. "With understanding and flexibility, support can be provided to all parents, regardless of their child care choices. We must transform the discussion from the superficial debates invoking ‘Mommy Wars' scenarios to mature, thoughtful examinations of how to help all families. It's time to figure out how to make support for families free of the bias which until now has made assistance available almost exclusively to those who pay for child care." <br>  <br>  Millions of families from a wide range of income levels, political outlooks, educational levels, races, religions and cultural backgrounds know that it's possible and deeply rewarding to care for their own children. A recent poll by the nonpartisan research organization Public Agenda reports that the majority of parents believe the best care for children is parental care. More families will act on their convictions when they have reliable information. Countless professionals who work with children from infancy through the teen years are urging parents to spend more time with their children. They believe that too many of today's children suffer from a deficit of parental time, attention and loving guidance, and some have issued eloquent messages of concern about children's unmet needs. <br>  <br>  In the mid-1990s, at a White House Conference on Infant and Child Development, the president asked the panel of experts: What specific types of experiences are most important and how much of each of them is necessary? Two of our nation's most distinguished doctors, pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton, M.D. and child psychiatrist Stanley I. Greenspan, M.D., have answered. In their recent book, "The Irreducible Needs of Children" (Perseus Books 2000) the doctors state: "We do not recommend full-time day care, 30 or more hours of care by nonparents, for infants and toddlers if the parents are able to provide high-quality care themselves and if the parents have reasonable options." They note that only 10% or less of infants and toddlers have access to high quality day care. They make recommendations for sweeping changes which could improve day care, but also caution: "….we believe that in the first two years of life full-time day care is a difficult context in which to provide the ongoing, nurturing care by one or a few caregivers that the child requires." And they add, "…studies of the quality of available day care are not optimistic. We may be trying to rationalize a system that simply isn't providing the essentials of what children need. It may therefore be best to reconsider our assumptions. The best way these assumptions can be reconsidered is by each and every family having good and accurate information. With this awareness we believe most|`|H3WHxCgaaa	First off - we had the child discussion long before marriage...all couples should.<br>  <br>  If the couple never discussed kids and one spouse doesn't want them - the couple should have none.  No sense in subjecting the child to a cold or indifferent parent...<br>  <br>  If the (woman) wanted children bad enough - she should consider divorcing her current spouse and try to find someone that does want kids.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the "accidental" children that some women end up having to force the issue.  It just isn't right...|`|AA11315360	No I wouldnt marry him in the first place if he didnt want kids! Do not have kids with a man who says he does not want any. You will end up divorced. He will resent you and not love his kids fully because he never wanted them!<br>  This is why you have to have serious conversations BEFORE marriage. I know my BF does want kids. And I make sure he doesnt want an insane amount like 5 kids. He wants just a few. If my BF said he never wants kids then I would break up with him.|`|jBigEy0Caa	No, but I would probably seriously consider divorce.  Having children was and still is very important to me.|`|uF5Xgtgraa	Did you know your husband didn't want children before you married?<br>  <br>  Seems a little late in the game for this question...|`|TGRKbQMVaa	I would not with this husband, he must be a very selfish person.|`|sZOeu7kkaa	Absolutely not unless the woman having them was financially, emotionally and mentally prepared to be a single parent once they were born. Because having a husband who did not want kids he is sure to walk out the door once they are born.
amKkfPS2aa	Wow. I would tell your ex-friend that you're sorry for your part in everything that happened between you guys in the past and say that you forgive her for hers and want to be mates again. This will give her a chance to express her forgiveness and apologies as well. Then mention your concerns for what's happening now and offer to help - because that's what she needs. Hopefully you and your friends can move past this and get through it. Good luck!
Ei3qd3x2aa	I believe it would be amazing, it shows that the boy is interested enough in her to share his life with her.  It may be a long drawn out award thing, but make it special for her... hold her hand, and if you get an award... give her a kiss on the cheek or something b4 you go up.  and after make her feel like and angel and do an amazing slow dance with her to show her how much you actually like her.|`|333W9jeCaa	I would say so, but be advised it's kinda boring. I went once & we didn't even dance, it was mostly like an awards & recognition ceremony. Don't get me wrong I support & respect the military, but it wasn't at all how I thought it was gonna be lol.
2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	Why would you wanna stop liking this guy? It's obvious you really like him. I say go and ask him if he'd like to see a movie on Friday, or start up a conversation with him about one of his hobbies. I think he likes you too but is not sure whether you like him back. Its sweet that you are worried about his reputation, high school sucks! If you ask him what's up he just might tell you|`|I46pJeBxaa	PFFF Below his reputation? That's an insult to yourself.

Just find yourself a new crush, possibly a cuter one? That will take your mind off of the other guy :)|`|cMyPQ90vaa	well if you really like him why stop liking him just sit and talk to him and let him know how you feel and maybe he'll let you know how he feels but make sure you talk to him alone and if you really do wanna stop liking him just move on and try to find someone else... that's my opinion.. good luck|`|2sl5Rl9qaa	Ignore him. Blank out his name completely. Pretend you dont even know him and dont look at him. I have this same problem with a guy in my school.

No reason to stop liking him tell him you like him. When i was in high school every year i picked one guy that i really liked. Every guy i liked i got. Even the hottest guy n school. It is all about confidence baby. Flirt for about a week and carry a conversation with him. Start saying hi in the hall and ignore him a few if he says hi to you and if there are signs that he likes ya back then tell him you like him. The worst that will happen is he could tell you he don't like you back if that is true then turn to his best friend and cry on his shoulder....lol!!!!!! There are plenty of guys out there ................... As for stoping liking him i still have feeling for some of my ex's i hate to tell ya but it is hard as hell to make any feelings go away. Unless you find somone better. haha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sxqUt49xaa	look at his faults.|`|de268996207e2277009ae109383ebab5aa	you can either stop liking him or gather up some courage and try being friends. Its hard to fall for a guy you don't even know, because when you  are one step into the relationship, you find out somthing that turns you off and *bam* its over. Easy enough is to show confidence and be a friend. Learn about him before you fall head over heals- literally!!! goood luck|`|e105cfb2a3df44e1d4835131ebd93824aa	Dont put yourself down! Why would it be below his reputation? If he is looking at you and you think he miight like you then you are obviously very much worthy in his eyes. Before you talk yourself out of liking him why dont you try just saying hi. See what happens?

87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	You need to bring it out in the open and stop pussy-footing around it. That's why you're so tongue-tied around each other. Tell him the truth; that what he did to your sister stunk and that if you had to do it all over again, you would. Why? Because you love your sister and you'll jump down the throat of anyone who hurts her. Plain and simple. Then tell him that now that they're married -for the sake of your sister- you want to get along. Give him a chance to vent also, then agree that you both want her happiness. Once you get it out in the open, stomp the topic to death then for pity's sake, move on already.

Tell him...you're not accusing him of anything, you just want an explaination.<br>  <br>  I found an email that my bf sent to his cousins friend.....very ummm.... discouraging for our relationship. I printed it, showed it to him, he had no excuse.

He may be upset that you were looking, or he may think of it as snooping, but at any rate you deserve answers to your questions. He needs to be able to give you some good logical ones or at least take you to meet his 'friends' that he hangs out with. To be in a relationship you need to enjoy some of what you both want to do in order to keep your own identity. If you don't, eventually you will both become unhappy and it will not end well. If he says its no big deal and you believe him then thats that, if you don't then let it go, and let him go....you don't need that.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	just tell him, hes going to be mad at first about you going on his myspace. but its a risk you need to take!
zCE0slQ5aa	what is the name of this disease?<br>  <br>  if you haven't seen a psychologist, i recommend it now.<br>  you have dealt with this disease for 23 years. you need to talk to a professional about it. they will be able to recommend a specialist, preferably one who deals with cases such as yours.<br>  <br>  you have a relationship with christ and this is your one and only saving grace. keep doing what you are doing in your faith.<br>  <br>  we can control our whole bodies. you should know this through your studies and relationship with the lord. it takes meditation and constant prayer and who knows when your sexuality and libido will slow down.<br>  <br>  drown yourself in work, study, and extra curricular activities. you have to discover a venting activity to release what has been quietly building in you for all these years. wow!<br>  <br>  GOD bless and good luck.
RvND5eNfaa	Are you doing it through yahoo or do you have her email address? does she still use either of these?<br>  <br>  I know myself that i have not always received messages through yahoo??<br>  <br>  Does she have 360? have you tried that.<br>  <br>  What's her name? <br>  <br>  No really what's her name?? don't keep us in suspense.lol<br>  <br>  ok ok i will stop it now....honestly i don't ignore any of my friends on here or elsewhere, i just do not seem to be getting any of my messages through here but only on my 360!|`|GaAYLFxXaa	ask her why she hasn't written back. and it is possible that she hasn't been on the computer in awhile. don't keep writing to her repeatidly either that may annoy her and she won't write back at all.|`|vjBLkWaPaa	are you sure shes actually been online?? if so... maybe she hasnt checked her emails.  or maybe shes just been to busy<br>  dont worry though i'm sure its not you<br>  good luck<br>  xx|`|Wv592rOqaa	Be patient as you had long periods of time when you did not communicate with her - and now you think she should rush and answer you each time - how fair is that?  <br>  <br>  Maybe life got in the way and she is busy doing what we do in life - I'm am sure if she is as lovely as you said she is - you will hear from her as soon as she is able to write you.
N8EB7YkMaa	My answer is mere assumption.  I assume you are stuck with it, however, I would call the station and ask if they would be will to put a "subtitle" on the screen that says "art vendor has since moved to a different location"  Can't hurt to ask.|`|4EWCegiRaa	I'm sorry but you're stuck.<br>  <br>  You can't have the change of venue put on the air because you won't reach the same audience (if they'd even agree to tell them you won't be there) and you can't put a sign up at the location because you burned that bridge.  You can't even stand out front or else the store owner will make you life miserable and have you legally removed.<br>  <br>  Sorry but better luck next time.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	I doubt there is anything you can do about it this late, but who knows, you could try contacting the station about it and go from there....
jfsul7ENaa	show her your *****|`|AA11755944	strong morals-good job.
ufjUGHvbaa	Okay girls are way more emotional than guys are so more chances than none she already loves you but is waiting for you to say it!!! Its just like getting married a girl knows when she has the right guy and what she wants she just has to wait for him to ask her !!! Hope this helps !!! Just say it dude I LOVE YOU!!!|`|i0oPSnBJaa	dude just go for it chances are if uv been together for 8 months theres gona be something there between u just tell her im sure she will smile and say it back :P
TIDqJgdSaa	well she thinks you like her... cause of the kiss.<br>  if you dont want to be with her than tell her than <br>  her hanging on a string waiting for you to pull her in.<br>  lay it down easily, dont but it down hard.<br>  If you want her, than GO FOR IT!!! <br>  <br>  if it is awkward just act cool act normal towards her<br>  girls HATE when guys act different when they tell you how they feel!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  do whats riightt<br>  xx|`|Ff7VS8lQaa	Ask her out, of course!|`|bszyOuIqaa	You should just hang out. Exchange ideas about the world. Laugh. Watch a movie. Eat together. See if you are really interested in knowing her. Is she fun to be around? Does she get the quirky things about you? Does she even try? The best way to really know someone is to be there. <br>  <br>  Try to avoid the intimate moments in the beginning cause it only confuses true feelings especially for girls.|`|IXskJPlVaa	So you have been in and out of relationships - you already must know how you should behave if you want to have a long term affair. It takes a lot of effort and commitment for that - trust is also important. See if you can deliver. Best of luck.|`|C8fmKUBJaa	date her|`|yxqMBDLwaa	call her and c what happens from there|`|XqcmZ7cDaa	Keep talking to her, see where it goes. Take it really slow and stay away from the whole affection thing. That makes the relationship not about the each of you. Really get to know each other.|`|aa584135943e0e2350c2ecaaa46be660aa	calll just because and check up on her
uIhFpcYwaa	I think that if she is your best friend adn he broke up with you or started going out with him he is out of bounds for the moment i will not say you are a bad friend that is your call but the fact you are asking means you feel bad so maybe take some time and think about it honestly Good luck <br>  Nash|`|lUNciXaKaa	Yikes, you are a bad friend. You could easily end up without a single friend if you don't stop stabbing the ones you have in the back. Guys will come and go, but a good friend could be your friend for the rest of your life. I think you should stop being "that" girl, the "other" one...how hurt would you be if your boyfriend were messing around with your one of your best friends? Regardless of how long you had something before they dated, he's not YOUR boyfriend. Hope that was what you were looking for.|`|fAePYki9aa	just to tell you i wouldn't want a friend like you. if i was going out with a guy and you were doing that kind of stuff and found out sooner than any of those girls did i would kick your ***.
ml2FDYECaa	Screw him. Don't put up with that ****. He's a jackass, and you deserve better. If you were going to his house you should have gone there to kick his ***, or slash his tires 'cause nobody deserves that. And if you were my sister it would have been a different story.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	Either he totally forgot.....Wait there's no why in hell he could have forgot about your date if you went over to his house!<br>  The only thing I can come up with is that either he don't like you or he do and he's just tryin' to be a player and don't know how to play the game!<br>  I mean so check him....and if you feel there's something going on...it usually is!|`|ZXhX78wsaa	sorry jojo : ( thats definatly no fun.<br>  <br>  are you 100% sure that it was him in the other room?<br>  <br>  have you talked to him since then? <br>  either ask him about it, or just let him know that he sucks for doing that lol && be done with him.|`|a1k0Mw8taa	unless her really forgot (some guys do lol) he doesn't like you. move on.|`|YJV2TU6taa	Totally done. What a loser, the least he could do is tell you to your face. Find someone worth your time, good luck!|`|hIwJxNVkaa	yes he isnt intrested..|`|E1u6LeJUaa	well, DUH!|`|TRt4tWGFaa	find you a mother boy|`|VSASkXQ7aa	it does mean he's not interested in you at least temporarily.<br>  <br>  Read somewhere , that if you persist , he'll be really annoyed/irritated/disinterested-in-you.<br>  <br>  SO ....let him go ...act/walk/live the confident girl that you are.<br>  <br>  He'll come back..and if he doesn't..well he wasn't worth it !|`|WInyhO09aa	there must  be something behind it. How long have yall been dating? You need to ask him what his deal is..if  he makes up excuses let him go if its something reasonable talk it over with him. Really he should've let you know something. Thats kinda childish!!|`|CBdP5EQeaa	It could, but maybe he just didn't want to see you right then. Maybe he was having a really bad day and just wanted some time to himself. Ask him about it? Atleast then you should get the truth.|`|HOjwnpmUaa	Sorry to say this, he doesn't like you, and now he probably thinks you're a stalker.|`|Df76r40taa	Um jojo you are a total booty call|`|vKJ6OFxxaa	yea im srry|`|igrdohopaa	Yeah hes playing around with you|`|FNwxcBPpaa	You should move on and find someone else.|`|yIqYnqk3aa	Dere myt be 2 possible case(as per as the lack of information),1st-His brother myt wants to date u<br>  2nd-U KNOW!!!(I don't wanna say),m also a guy i don't wanna say this,bt most of the guys are same!!!!Hope u understand wht m tryina say...|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	i afraid so! but if i was u, i will ask the brother to tell him that "if he doesnt want to have a date with me, all he has to do is telling me so! dont waste my precious time! i dont play!"|`|n7BuH75gaa	He is done with you.<br>  <br>  Nice guy, huh?<br>  <br>  Happy hunting.|`|T72COWC8aa	I think he is playing games with you..
bXcvzGHGaa	Ur friend obviously have a problem with viewing sex or anythin related. <br>  I suggest u have a serious talk about it ,if she opens up to u then she will feel better. ask her why she react as such an what is the problem.Im not sure if u cn help her,mayb she does need a professional view.|`|ImnZzaRCaa	well seems to me from what you have added that she is very senstitive to sexual instances and this probably stems from her being very uncomfortable and insecure with herself.<br>  <br>  talk to her-tell her you notice it and maybe she can tell you the root of the issue and you two can take it from there.|`|m3Nr3U3Jaa	THE THING IS THAT SHE IS A VERY GOOD GIRL......AND SHE THINKS THESE ARE TYPE OF SIN.<br>  <br>  SO.......SHE DOES NOT LIKE THESE......YOU SHOULD TELL HER THAT.....THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE AND PRETTY NORMAL.......IF HER PARENTS WOULD THINK LIKE THAT THEN MAY BE SHE WOULD NOT BORN.......<br>  <br>  TRY TO MAKE HER USE TO OF THESE THINGS......LIKE SHOWING HER SOME ADULT MOVIES AND THOSE STUFFS.......HOPE LATER ON SHE WILL UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS......|`|6SP9YvDzaa	this isn't normal. there is most likely an underlying issue here. if she's not going to see a councilor (which is what she should do!!)<br>  Get her to open up to you or someone else about why she feels like this and the possible course of it.|`|h9OgghFlaa	let her make more friends, met people and discuss sex with other girl that are experience in sex.|`|8xx3uk4Jaa	i she believes in past lives, something might have happened in her last life.<br>  she couldve been raped or someone naked got killed that she was c;lose to?<br>  idk|`|zs4Rpa6Vaa	this is seriuse..mabey shes lesbian and just afraid to admit it...just saying|`|Cyg3exYdaa	how old is she...|`|ls3TD7Teaa	i am here to give you the most serious answer i can think of, if she is so shy about sexual nature then that may not ever change. ask her to watch some "videos" with you, make her comfortable. the only advice i can give you to give to her is that she needs to get confident with sexual nature. :) i hope that i helped:) good luck:)|`|UWKusmdmaa	My friend did this as well<br>  she was very frightened at changing in the changing rooms, i think she was body conscious or worried about something<br>  if she is worried about something it's always good to let it out to someone that tou trust|`|T5aH1Kssaa	Tell her boyfriend to take it very slow for her(as in wait for marriage)!!!|`|uAIo2A0gaa	I would really try to talk to her to see if you can really help if she wont see a counsellor. It may have been a bad experience or one of her boyfriends could of said something you know how that goes when someone says something to you it lowers your self esteem. but I would just take her some where private where she wont be embarresed to talk and I would just talk with her. If she has problems with movies that have sexual content in them I would maybe it might sound kinda dumb but maybe take her to see kids movies that may be able to ease her into the movies that have that content. she needs to become comfortable in the cinema before seeing something that makes her uncomfortable. hope this helps you.|`|TUkBRvfSaa	Tell her to be cool with it.<br>  And try and have a romantic dinner and then after relax in the bed room and take it slow with her tell her to just relax.<br>  I hope i helped..<br>  x|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If she can't be asked to see a councilor or do anything about it then can't see how you could help. She can't be that bothered.|`|SzZxgHdtaa	Maybe she needs to see a sex therapist with her partner (yes there are such things!) so they can discuss this.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sounds like some deep seated psychosis... she needs professional help...|`|S5FubLOVaa	take it slow. make sure shes comfortable. tell her boyfriend to be gentle with her and it will all be alright mate ;)|`|mt3Af2FYaa	She is not messed up mentaly or anything like. That there is no need to see a doc about this. Its just the way she was brought up. If her parents treated sexuality like it was some big secret then thats the way she will be. She is completely normal!!<br>  <br>  I have a friend like that. She gets all red in the face when ever sex is brought up. I am a very open person when it comes to sex. So I do talk about it openly with her. It seems the more we talk about it the more comfortable she gets. She is slowly getting better. As for her boyfriend I think the same thing applies. He needs to be patient with her and she needs to try to be more open. It will take time but she will eventually get more comfortable with it. Hope this helps!!
DIlMYYBQaa	He sounds like a freaking hypocrite to me! You don't need friends like him!|`|amKkfPS2aa	Whoa whoa, take it from a Christian, regardless of our morals we are human and make mistakes like anyone else. Sure, it might like your friend is a hypocrite, but he just messed up and he needs to turn back to God for help. God didn't design us to be perfect and never screw up again after we come to Him, but to learn from our mistakes and to turn to Him when we're ready; if we're willing to accept and particularly if we need help. We are sinful creatures, and ironically since mistakes are supposed to be accidents, they're also inevitable. Instead of being mad at him, therefore making it worse for him, how about forgiving him as Jesus would do and supporting him as a friend should do? Wouldn't you want him to treat you that way if you were in his shoes? How would you feel if, on top of becoming a parent while you were still a minor and having to leave what happened all up to your partner, he chose to walk out of your life and stop being your friend altogether - point fingers at you? Let go of the grudge and be there for him. End of story. It's as simple of that.|`|EatBSWv2aa	K are you a guy or girl<br>  If your a guy I don't see why you should be mad at him<br>  unless your bi & you liked him???<br>  If your a girl then are you mad because you liked him<br>  & you wanted him for you<br>  Regardless if you guys are just friends then no there is no reason for you to be mad at him....|`|Wv592rOqaa	Not sure what you are mad at your friend.  Sounds like he is telling you he mad a bad mistake and he is happy that out of the two of you, you are the smart one.  <br>  <br>  Had he used protection (even in sin) he would not be entering parenthood - which has a whole new set of rules and problems - and suppose the girl he got pregnant is not the girl he wanted to marry - that's more drama --- I cannot believe you are the one that is MAD!  <br>  <br>  You should be patting yourself on the back - and he admires you! And, if he does not then I ADMIRE you and RESPECT you!

AA11891740	I believe we are celebrating on the same day...5-3-09? Right? :)<br>  <br>  How did(WILL) you(WE) celebrate your (OUR) first anniversay?<br>  We're going to Ceasars Windsor--Hubby booked a suite overlooking the water and we're going to see Sara Evans. :) Of course we'll be eating our top layer of our cake too! :) I hope it still tastes good...lol!<br>  <br>  <br>  Is marriage everything you dreamed it would be?<br>  I went in with realistic expectations, it has indeed been everything I hoped & dreamed. :) My Husband is my soulmate, everything about him compliments me...we're seriously ying & yang...:) I love that we're in this together forever and though we don't always agree completely we respect eachother enough to LISTEN. We bought a house 2 months after the Wedding so we're really enjoying making the house into our dream home. Fun-Fun! We really do have a ball together, I don't only love & adore him but I really like & enjoy his company. You have to be friends first--->it really is about marrying your bestfriend.:))|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	My wife smiles her warm and wonderful smile at me when I get home and gives me a good hug and kiss, and that's why I can't wait to get home.<br>  <br>  Oh, oops, sorry - I don't qualify to answer this question because I've been married for 22 years.  Sorry!|`|YHcyuka3aa	There is not one particular thing he does, its just that I like being with him when ever where ever.|`|0tusTThyaa	I am on my second marriage. Which has a twist. My husband [now] and I knew each other when I was dating my first husband, but we were at different places. I got divorced, came to terms with the mistakes I made in the marriage. Then my husband [now] and I started emailing and now we're married. I love every moment of it. We just celebrated our 1st anniversary, 2-29-09 is our date! <br>  <br>  We celebrated our anny a little early. I live in FL and he lives in VA. He came down for Vday weekend. We got each other the traditional paper gift for the first wedding anniversay.<br>  <br>  If my husband [now] and I got married when we first knew each other, I am not sure it would have worked, different place in our lives. <br>  <br>  I love every minute of my life now!!!<br>  <br>  CONGRATS to you!|`|ZEitfScGaa	We went to Mexico for our one year. Fun!<br>  Anyway, its great to be married. Although for me I had been with her for seven years already, and lived with her for most of those so not too much changed. She doesn't have to do anything to make me smile and want to be home with her. I just do when I think about her. She is GREAT!!!|`|XGp3oF5baa	I've been married for 5 months and 12 days!! :) <br>  I love everything about my hubby! I love how he gives me hugs that makes me feel like he never wants to let go and how he tells me he loves me when he thinks I am asleep. Just EVERYTHING!!<br>  I think on your first anniv. you are supposed to eat the top layer of your wedding cake. So I am going to go out somewhere really nice and then when we get home we are going to light our unity candle and eat cake! <br>  Oh. . . it is better than my dreams.|`|yBlRruIXaa	well our 1 year came and went.  I think we went out to dinner, but that was a stretch seeing as in this economy either one or the other of us have been out of a job for the last 6 months.  Totally sucks, but at least we dont fight about money, because there is none to fight about.  j/k
JnElq85taa	You're not being fair to anyone, including yourself.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Break up with your boyfriend.  It'll be better for him in the long run.  If you care about him at all, spare him the extra humiliation and heartache and stop stringing him along.  You're playing him for a fool.<br>  <br>  Step 2:  Stop this thing you have going with the 19 year old.  Clearly, he's not going to treat you right and truthfully, you probably only want him for the thrill of the chase. Once you break up with your boyfriend and your sexual relaitonship with this guy is no longer "forbidden," you'll lose interest.  And it doesn't sound like he's all that interested in you anyway.  Plus, this relaitonship started out of a lie.  It won't go anywhere good.<br>  <br>  Step 3:  Stay single for awhile.  Get to know yourself and think about who you really are and what you really want.  It seems like you're lost.  Find yourself before you lose all respect for yourself and everyone else.
FUlu7iJuaa	be patient.<br>  you obviously don't understand how a woman's brain works.<br>  we NEED more time, especially when pressured.<br>  if you aren't willing to wait, then that isn't ''love''.<br>  she's probably expecting you to wait, so if you don't want to,<br>  then just dump her instead of leading her to believe it's love.<br>  Jerk.
g5bM6dPRaa	hell yes i am romantic a girl needs to feel she is number one in your life i once set up my room with rose pedals and candles and well i some major action girls love romance and when you give it you get it in return|`|lAqV1OmRaa	I definitely like guys who are romantic. I don't want a mushy, over the top boyfriend all the time, but a boyfriend who does a romantic thing here and there is great. In order for him to do the most romantic thing, he needs to know his girlfriend very well and what appeals to her most. In my case, it was when I had a long talk with my boyfriend one night while we were sitting by the rail of a ship out on the ocean, and then he took me in his arms and passionately kissed me.|`|e105cfb2a3df44e1d4835131ebd93824aa	99% of ladies love romance, my husband is'nt romantic in the conventional sense but he does so many small things for me that it all adds up. Like running me a bath or making me a meal. He treats me really well and pampers me. I would love it if he booked a fancy hotel and surprised me though. But i am happy with him just the way he is!!|`|I46pJeBxaa	yesyesyes<3<br>  romantic guys are amazing :)<br>  <br>  I'm a hopeless romantic myself<3<br>  <br>  Idk..guys normally don't be romantic to me D:<br>  I think they think it's lame|`|ikCFkPY7aa	Guys being romantic is really nice.<br>  <br>  I've never had anything really romantic done for me, but general small things like random compliments from my boyfriend are really nice.|`|Fue5b9wmaa	Not a lot, occasionally.

I wish he did.|`|bS5dGxBtaa	My ex boyfriend use to buy me flowers and balloons and leave them in my car so when id wake up to go to work they would be there to surprise me!!!|`|azbt1xddaa	yessss i love when guys are romantic. my boyfriend hasn't really done anything romantic for me|`|p9QndBScaa	I love romance,my man once had rose pedals in a tub filled with water and candle's  all around,it was really sweet.|`|SnWZusBIaa	I love it when a guy is romantic.|`|C8fmKUBJaa	i LOVE romantic guys. he made dinner for two, then we watched a bunch of girly movies :)|`|vrfuO9Asaa	i like guys who r romantic <br>  poems.x|`|u70TaWI5aa	Yes I am the most romantic thing I have done was to give a girl flowers before she left on a trip. The flowers were not just a dozen roses no, they were 18 pink rose and one white rose. The reason I did it this way was that we would be 18 states a part and the 19th which was the white one was still me. she loved it.|`|JCdBSULraa	I'm overly romantic.  I've done a lot of things, but I don't think women understand romance anymore, and usually mark me down as a creep.<br>  <br>  These are some things I've done, not all of them for the same girl, and none of these girls were considered a "girlfriend" just someone I was interested in:<br>  <br>  Wrote poems for her<br>  Written tiny notes and left them for her on her car<br>  Wrote a song for her<br>  Bought her a bouquet of flowers (with a card asking her to give me a chance as a boyfriend - she said no)<br>  confronted her (in public where she could feel safe) and insisted on a date - ice skating and her favorite restaurant<br>  bought her single roses and left on her car (30 miles away from me).<br>  written her cards<br>  given her birthday gifts<br>  took her to a play|`|qs6RMGvdaa	I love it when guys just try to care or try to at least make an effort to be romantic. <br>  <br>  My guy doesn't really do anything romantic.. He got me a stuffed animal unexpectedly. But he really doesn't do anything romantic. <br>  He makes me laugh a lot though.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Yes very much so. Many - but the most is - kissing her first thing in the morning for the past 26 yrs when she is there with the bed tea. Best of luck.|`|vweoheAvaa	I don't know if I'm romantic or not.....I've never had a girlfriend.|`|bszyOuIqaa	I'm a woman. I love guys who are romantic but sometimes you don't get the guy that's all neatly packaged.  What I'm saying is sometimes you have to say, "Dude you aren't romantic and I want some romance dammit!"<br>  <br>  The most romantic thing a guy has ever done for me was getting me this book called Eat You Peas. They make different ones for mother, sisters, friends, boyfriends, husbands, etc. He gave me the one "For someone special."<br>  <br>  It was the most thoughtful gift I ever received and it's a gift that really keeps giving because whenever I'm having a rough day or anything I can turn to that mini book and know that there is someone who really supports me.  It's full of animation and little promises to reassure you.  I was like WOW.  He moved to Philly and I still read it. It's so cute, thoughtful, romantic and inspirational.<br>  <br>  I don't even know how he got the idea to give it to me. GREAT gift.|`|3eea6e5c934e4e0ecf0ffb555cd24622aa	I like guys who are romantic, but not too romantic or cheesy romantic. I think the little things are the most romantic. Like helping a girl put her coat on, opening up the car door, visiting/picking her up from work. Little things like that are thoughtful, but not cheesy.|`|YJH5YcjBaa	Nope haha I don't like romantic stuff, I think its corny, I don't find roses and candles and all that stuff cute, I personally think sunflowers are cute and better than roses, but don't really want em as "gifts"<br>  .....romantic stuff is for older married people hahahaha|`|AA11170671	I live in Augusta, Ga. I was dating a lady three years ago. So for her birthday.

mFbPOUWyaa	I think chatting online is fine.  Just don't get all "lovey dovey" before you meet.  Also, meet soon.  Don't wait forever to meet them -  I know someone who has fallen in love with a guy she met on like, match.com and now they're getting married!  All within the year.  I don't think that talking to men online is a bad way to meet someone at all.  Just do it carefully because there are STILL plenty of freaks out there. (NOT only online either.) Chat online, talk on the phone, and then meet in a public place or with friends to see if he is dating material. :)<br>  <br>  Note:  I do have  friend and he has been single for three years as well - he has been doing online dating as well as meeting girls around the city.  He is still waiting for someone to get in a relationship with him till this day, and he is a good guy.  Sometimes these things JUST take time. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mqTEGbCYaa	I don't know what to said. I love being single and i am  19. You should enjoy being single and you see after you are not so worry about having a bf you get ask out more often. When i guy seems interesting on you dont encourage them that seems to work for me. You might thing you are not being foward but they might think differently.|`|8FYI7Ogzaa	yikes yikes yikes. ew that was a gross pic. internet date be safe. better than meeting at the bar. try  local sporting events too....|`|Jhr68T0baa	Im sorry but its true. theres nothing anyone can say. Love will come soon. You have to be patient.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	Go on cupid.com  or a nice dating site. Don't go out with losers that just want sex.  You could get a nice husband on this site. Don't accept anything but what you want, and be honest. Say what you expect, and what you won't accept. There are a million guys out there but you have to weed out the others. That means, ask tons of questions, like:  will you go to church with me every sunday?  Are you a Christian,,,., do you want kids...do you have any kids....have you ever had a sexual disease/////  will you get tested before we go to that level?   Are you wanting a one night stand,  a one month relationship, or marriage.....  Meet all his friends and parents before you jump in bed with him..   How about getting a ring on your finger, and get married before you give him you.....  How about gettting to know him better, like what is he like when he's mad?  Does he treat animals nice when they don't listen?  Does he like kids, well watch him around kids and see for yourself.... How did he dump his old girlfriends? Did he ever slap or punch a gal? Find out before.... Maybe he believes that you should pick up after him, wait on him hand and foot, and cook perfect meals, dishes, laundry, and do everything at home. Maybe he doesn't want his gal to go to work, find this out. Or maybe if your a homemaker, he wants a gal to go out and make money, if your not the type to go out and work, and you want to be a homemaker, than he's not right for you so find out.....Some men want there money seperate from you, some never want to put your name on there house, or some want joint everything. Find out before.....Find out how he wants to disicpline your kids, cause if your soft, and he wants to bring out the belt... Find out before...    Good Luck,  but it's a lot of homework, and studing before you decide.... Also don't meet him alone... Have a gal with you, see if he flirts with her,,,find out... Plus don't meet alone, cause he might be bad, so to fight him off, you may need help./|`|544b2680a30db2de782d078a5a74d992aa	I think your best bet is to get out!<br>  bars<br>  pubs<br>  clubs<br>  or even the grocery store<br>  friends of friends<br>  you say you have guy friends have them hook you up|`|kyUiaDgyaa	Sweetheart  you need to relax, there is someone out there for you, but you need to seek that special man out, and there is probably a man out there seeking for some special lady like you, but you have to be patient, I was in my mid to late 30's when I met my special lady, and in my early 40's when I said "I do" so just be patient ther is someone out there, but you need to seek him out even if it takes you a long time|`|8RY8EucDaa	ah yes it happens :( maybe you should just ask the guys out who you like rather than waiting for them to ask you. btw, I found the love of my life on the internet as well :D so it might work! good luck!|`|4CMx1uzXaa	You can not force it. They will start dating you when the time is right. Destiny has a funny way of shaping up.|`|ryjnt3dhaa	Try hanging out in different places than usual.  Maybe try going to church?|`|KNBTViNNaa	Make the first move. Are you interested in any of your guy friends? If so invite them to come over to hang out with just you. See how things go, maybe you can start something romantic.  Basically if you want something in life you need to take it. Don't wait around for it. Confidence is key.|`|iW9GBrg6aa	Sorry but i have to tell you that it will come to you when you least expect it to happen. You can't always win when you go searching for somebody. You might just be looking in the wrong places. That's how it happened with me. They will eventually come to you.|`|zY7boFYNaa	I understand probably you are feeling bad for waiting too long, but just go to some social gatherings with friends, maybe some dates out there.|`|563ea2da5972305f3934b47e0c36e0a3aa	well dont go with your first answer for sure!!!! just keep trying. try to hang out with just girls, because when you are with guys, other guys automatically believe you are with one of the guys you are around..go out one night with all girls!!!|`|7a7a8b25f6c8edb1f3143b162357b855aa	my opinion is get out there-<br>  have fun! u don't need a guy to make you happy...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309094835AAAOGEA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  answer mine^|`|Yfb5c4r8aa	One up the Octomom|`|PXN7r0RRaa	NO... TRY HARDER|`|eS9MfSvmaa	Well, get out there girl! Party, be who you are, and let yourself be seen. A guy can't come to you if you're invisible, right? You don't have to be wild to be heard. Just make sure you're not just sitting there. Be confident and flirt. If he's not your type, then ditch him. If he's a jerk, he wasn't worth the time anyways. Just be careful not to hurt yourself. Falling for the wrong guys will never turn out right. They'll build you up and let you fall, then step all over you. Just watch out for them, and you'll be good. Act real and be real. Keep it up and hold your head high no matter how many times your heart gets broken. As long as you're not being easy or letting guys use you, you've got your dignity, right? But like I said, watch out for the wrong guys. They can be serious b1tiches.
qQWYeOpgaa	he doesn't cleeborp.|`|uvn609hsaa	Antony C is very rude! =O<br>  <br>  Anyway, I guess a shy guy will smile and maybe say hi now and again. But if you like him then you will have to make the first move as he is not likely to. You should get to know him better and then you might find that he isn't that quiet or shy really. There are a lot of people who seem shy around new people, but after a while they change their tune.<br>  Good luck.<br>  x<br>  <br>  Team Edward!!|`|FbwyvwEYaa	A shy guy will probably blush a lot when he's around you, stutter, try to small talk but it never actually works out. Most of times they keep to themselves unless you make the first move. They don't talk much either. It's really hard to tell with shy guys.|`|Lz2mhKKRaa	And I don't care about your problems either.  They are shy because they don't like you.  And by the way the movie Twilight sucked!|`|TZfDvyshaa	AVOIDING 13 YEAR OLD GIRLS.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	just be yourself!! that's all any person can do!!

You want to make something of a gesture that is probably so insignificant.  You are living off of false hope.  He put his handby your shoulder?!?!  Seriously is that something that even matters?  "Hey this guy put his hand on my back, now I like him."  Please grow up.|`|MdPJcePMaa	get his number and text him.. they'll def open up more through a text and see if he tries to continue the convo / see how long it takes him to respond. that should get you a good sign.|`|KtLpWGU4aa	I used to be shy lol.<br>  Try to talk with him.

SqrPpm5Daa	You're stuck between a rock and a hard place there.  I can see your husbands view that a visit would be nice.  But I can also see yours that it would be hard to have a woman you hardly know visiting for so long.  Heck, 30 days is a long time for anyone to visit.  <br>  <br>  I don't know what you can do as your husband doesn't seem to be listening to you at all.  The best thing would be for her to cut the visit shorter.  You might ask her if she has that option if your husband won't.  I'd phrase it more along the lines of asking if she can visit twice, once now for a week or so and then later when the baby is older and more fun to be around for a week or so.  <br>  <br>  The second best thing seems to me would be finding her a hotel.  At least for part of her visit.  But if she can't afford it that might mean you have to pay for it.  And believe me, I know a military salary doesn't always cover much, especially with a new baby.  But you might check MWR for any deals they might have or local military lodging that might cost less.  Or see if the Armed Forces Vacation Club has any facilities near you.<br>  <br>  Last if your husband or you can't find any other way out of this then remind him that if you're supporting him as a "good" wife then he better be supporting you like a "good" husband should.  He better be saving leave to take as much time off as he can when she's there so HE can run interference for you if you need it.  And maybe he ought to pass this pearl of wisdom on to his grandmother:  "You're here to cook and clean.  If they let you hold the baby count yourself lucky."  I bless whoever told my MIL that before she visited (and I bless her for passing it on to my mom *God, I love my whole family*) and totally intend to remember it for when my own daughters have children.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Wow, she has some nerve!  Who in the right mind would TELL someone that they are staying at their house for a month right after a baby is born?!  I would be livid.  I don't have any advice, but I just wanted to tell you that I would be pissed too.  She is a stranger!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	best stay at home with her at all times since you don't trust her.<br>  it's only one month then she gets the boot out the door.|`|AA11496527	No you are not wrong, but there is critical information missing from your question (I know you can't list everything). It's really necessary to know how the bio mother lied, that is, did she lie to save herself embarrassment or about things she didn't want others to know. Not knowing puts all your answers at a disadvantage.<br>  <br>  The real issue is; did your husband know she was coming? If he didn't then he  needs to address it with his bio mother, if he did then he has a lot of explaining as to why he didn't discuss it with you his wife! There's a lot wrong here with the communication with in the family including, the bio mother.<br>  <br>  At this point I'm not sure what you can do about the bio mothers visit (not knowing what kind of liar you thinks she is), except to recommend that you stay vigilant and watch what she does. I would however, while she's there, sit her down and tell her how you feel. Telling someone that you didn't understand what she said about this or that is a round about way to open up the subject about lying without really saying the word liar or that they are a liar. <br>  <br>  You should speak with your husband about this situation, in that you are uncomfortable because of this situation and want to insure it doesn't happen again. If he is as understanding as you say that should be no problem but it does need to be said.<br>  <br>  And just so you know; 30 days is a long visit.|`|AA11550245	What's done is done.  <br>  I would tell your husband if you want me to support you on this one, then get her a hotel.  <br>  If that can't happen, then see if can stay with some friends or family that she knows beside you?<br>  <br>  It's a sticky situation.<br>  I know it's going to be hard.  If arrangements can't be made I would ask you husband to speak with her after she leaves and when she returns home.<br>  Most of all enjoy it.  Grandmas are there for and reason, and one day you will understand.  <br>  I have 2 kids 6 and 7 and grandpa always complains about money.  But they go out and buy them the most expensive toy.  Go figure.  <br>  It's just one of the grandparent things you have to learn to bite you tongue on.  Good Luck <br>  I understand.  Don't stress.  And soon she will be gone.

ww59ahwYaa	yes it is perfectly normal for a father to hug his son.  I think it is a very macho thing to do and helps build up bonds between father and son.|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	Yes, especially if you have daughters that he is affectionate with.  Be glad he isn't "too manly"  to love his son.|`|AA12233287	Of course. As a father and a son and a grandfather, I would say it would be wrong not to.|`|l4d1Vg2Vaa	yes, of course! Males should show affection, just as females should. Why are you asking such a funny question?|`|LNeSlzCCaa	yeah whats wrong with it????  if they are snuggling on the couch maybe I would question it but a hug ---not a big deal|`|Pp3WHtSFaa	Not something I would enjoy daily but a hug is definately an important part of showing one's affection during hard times. I would say this apply's differently to different people. Some families are closer than others. I would say it is unhealthy to never hug.|`|n8rrXke1aa	Yes it does! a father should show he loves his son in the same way a mother might show her daughter, there is nothing in appropriate about a father giving his son a hug! its a natural thing in families to do|`|0VWPazrdaa	I dont think it's weird at all, it's just a hug. Geez it's not like you guys are french kissing|`|vLFhGJuXaa	why would a father not hug his son that is a better question|`|5AYEWCdTaa	Um yes.  Why wouldn't a father hug his son?|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	ya|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Yea. Showing affection is good. I'm a girl but my dad still hugs me all the time. I think it's great when parents are still able to show affection.

I am sure your mom would enjoy the change for a night, too.|`|yDVlTUYTaa	How about going out to dinner together?

Maybe you can schedule in a "family date" each week.|`|tumes18Kaa	Try a family game night.

Well, 15yrs old aside, that's enough itself to make a parent dislike you and the relationship. If you feel like you are ready to date, stop sneaking.

9e30d71f323568b2e90ae955cd6dc0b8aa	Why not make it a girls' night in? Instead of going out, everyone get together at someone's house and do something fun together. Make it a potluck where everyone brings something to munch on (or drink). Whether it's renting movies, watching old reruns, playing board games, or just hanging out & talking, just having her friends there will be very helpful. She may feel the need to talk about her feelings or she may be private. But the bottom line is that it will help her to see that so many people care about her.|`|kVamzVZEaa	AWWW, I feel really bad for her, but it's life (sigh). This maybe harsh to say to her, but you will need to tell her to get over it she can't be sad for the rest of her life. Life goes on.  If she really loves children then maybe she could adopt one, there are lots of homeless children who needs a good home. She could adopt one when it was a baby and raise it like it was her own child.|`|FIJxs3VEaa	You can just make a baby by her husband then.
hD5xU3Moaa	I had been friends with this guy(let's call him greg) for a couple years. Then one day greg gets called into the office for an incident. Next thing i know i'm getting called out of class to talk to the police! I go down there and my friend is sitting there and says "dude they know about the **** we stole." He then feeds me lines to tell the cops so that we don't get in trouble. The cop tells me that she is only going to arrest me because i "willingly transported stolen goods in my car." Turns out, greg had pinned the entire thing on me, even though i didn't have any part in it, other than letting greg and two of other my friends put something in my car. The cops had no idea about the theft until he gets called in for throwing ****, and says i stole something in an attempt to save his own ***.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	In HS a boyfriend broke up with my answering machine.  Lame.|`|I6NwduJPaa	well, back in elementary school i was bff with the most popular girl in school, had been for years. Then one year, BAM no longer friends, AND she gets the entire grade to bully me with her. But not in an obviously, she was smarter than that. They bullied me through exclusion, rumours, and name calling (not to my face, but when i could hear) Ya, it basically ruined my young life. So, I win!
6zmRI4QAaa	I have been in an abusive relationship also, and I would like to say that I understand what you mean but due to a lack of knowing you I can only relate.<br>  <br>  In my case me and my soon to be ex-husband went through a lot of bad things, his drug use and alcoholism and being physically and emotionally abusive towards me. But it seems as time passed those bad things got almost erased from my memory and I could only remember the silly fun things that we did. Especially when I was single.<br>  <br>  It's almost as if I don't want to remember him as the prick that he was.<br>  <br>  I think no matter how bad the relationship was we try to remember the good parts so we can tell ourselves that there was something in the relationship that was worth trying to save it to justify why we put up with all those horrible things for that long.|`|tjA819rXaa	good that you did that but don't feel ashamed.|`|6yq5YQeyaa	first off u need to get yourself a new man... u were in love with him for christ sakes! sometimes being single isn't the best thing for a person. find someone to occupy your time to take you mind off him and to keep you busy because other wise you'll be like those girls who sit in the house and morn over men and gain weight and wonder why they began to have health problems. You have a life! live it and don't worry about the yesterdays. <br>  <br>  while your worrying about him he's having a beautiful time without you so DO YOU!!|`|cQ22MEU6aa	First let me applaud you for getting out of that abusive relationship and also by saying you are in no way worthless.  If you were why did he take it upon himself to leave you the reference he did?  I believe he realizes what a good woman you are and now that you have severed the ties you have between you he is feeling sorry for himself.  I am in no way willing you back into his arms.  If anything run the other direction.  We have a tendency to settle for whatever is put in front of us.  Like we don't have enough self esteem to realize we are worth and deserve more from this life and those things around us. <br>  <br>  So what he knows you looked.  And?  Are you more ashamed that he saw you peeking or that you betrayed yourself and had a moment of weakness?  Either way it is already done.  Don't feel guilty for having feelings for him.  As long as you don't act on them.  It's ok to admire someone from afar.  To remember the things you used to do and the times and moments you have shared.   As long as you don't go back searching for the past in the future. <br>  <br>  We all long to be wanted, needed, cherished and loved by someone.  It hurts because you loved him even when he was abusive.  It hurts because you still love him.  It will take time and in that time work on yourself.  Start making yourself some other memories.  Find someone else who you have had that eye on and let them know you want to go to dinner or dancing.  <br>  <br>  There will be more tears, but allow the tears to become a part of your healling process. Live, Love, and Laugh.  Good luck.|`|xftU8PeQaa	Well it seems as if you were always there for him and he did not appreciate you at all. Now that it is over you have to put it in the past and keep on going. It also seemed as if you had no time to yourself always at his gigs. But you should just start doing the things that make you happy without anyone and sone enough he will come to you.(not the guy your talking about) So just try to avoid things that remind you of the bad past and look foward to a better future. (and 30 is not to late) And if he was manipulating you and those things you should of left a long time ago. No one needs that in there life. And he does not deserve you if he is just making you feel bad. That is all i gots to say. And im soory about the situation.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Deep down you miss him and havent settled into a new relationship yet.Perhaps your nostalgia for the past is more to do with loneliness than anything else|`|AA12059817	Maybe he's the only one you've ever felt emotionally connected to. I know the feeling of wanting to go back..despite what has happened and try to "fix" him, and make it work again...I think somehow you still love him, and possibly you're starting to buy into his rhetoric about not being able to get anyone else. or that (nobody else can love you like him)...that's not true.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	it's hard to leave some one that you have feelings for but it's for the best especially the way he treated you. you're going to feel weird for the next couple months until you fined some one or some thing to distract your mine from him. you need to for get about him and just continue your life.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Don't think about thing in the past, when you remember him, remember those bad time he gave you and congratulate yourself for being so smart and strong to have the power to dump him.  You are only 30.  I have a friend that went to have a cup of coffee and meet this guy almost her age or order, she was about 70 and they got married.  Who want somebody who abuse your verbally.  It's only make you low your self steem.  Thank God you are over, don't look back to this jerk and continue with your life.  I had someone like that and no matter how lonely I feel, I'm so happy I dumped him.  God bless and I hope you feel better.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	You are testing the selfish capacity to endure.  It is common among those who have yet to discover the infinite possibilities of personal development and growth.  This is a comfort zone where all the variables are known and  manageable.  You are in control of grief and pleasure.  It is all part of evolving into the independent self.<br>  <br>  Personal pleasure is unique.  Individuals learn to command the intensity of enjoyment and focus on pleasure.  The prospects of independent critical thinking can be intimidating because the freedom is so awesome. <br>  <br>  A good example is the satisfaction of academic, athletic, and extra curricular achievement or accomplishment.  The personal gratification is mirrored and admired by the self appreciation for attaining or exceeding goals.<br>  <br>  When it is all about you there will be minimal if any time to wallow in regret.<br>  <br>  Expolore auto erotic pleasure.  Guarantee discreet, personal, and  private control of sensual gratification.  Self reliance eliminates the possibility for interference or social abuse.<br>  <br>  Even nostalgic moments will only recall the pleasurable moments.  It sounds as if you are prepared to move beyond the boundary of being naive.  <br>  <br>  Discover self and the euphoria that is yours for the taking anytime you have the desire.  Bring out the WOW inside you.  You are the only person you really need to build a unique perception of nirvana.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	Isn't it funny that sometimes you are in a relationship that you know is unhealthy.  Yet,  when you look back on it, as we all do, it seems so different.  What I usually do when that happens is, I remember a good thing, then for every good thing I think about several bad things.  The thoughts quickly go away and I don't feel so melancholy anymore.  Hope this helps you, you definitely did the right thing ending things.  Good Luck to you.|`|6JrCDCtuaa	hmm it's common to reminisce about your relationship, especially the good times. i was in a similar situation, except there was no physical abuse. even worse, my best friend and him hated each other and i was the monkey in the middle. i think you should do yourself a favor and stop reading his blogs and all the things that remind you of him. you need to let yourself free and move on. good luck :)|`|Cyg3exYdaa	I don't really understand the question But from my point of view that guy is an insensitive jerk<br>  <br>  pleae answer my questions|`|AA10500537	you have to forget he ever existed and go on with your new life without him.<br>   he doesn;t deserve you,|`|UhWQuxLVaa	move on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and erase him from ur memory bank.....he's not worth ur time|`|2S2onP86aa	It hurt you because you felt related to it I suppose. And yes, you should feel disappointed in yourself for feeling this way because darling you shouldn't. You're better off without him, right? You should not even check his gigs or whatsoever. Just completely forget it. You were happy with your decision and keep it this way. There is no reason to look at what this abusive ex is doing now, or even remember the good or bad moments with him, though I think the bad moments were kind of more than the good ones. So just forget about it. Erase him. No need to look at anything that he's doing, whether it's in the past, present or near future. Just cherish the moment you are in right now. I'm proud of the deicison you made when you left him. Life is too short to live or endure someone that curel and manipulative. Keep it this way gorgeous. Tons of other guys would wish to have you - so stop wasting your time.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful. Best of luck. ?|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	You need to clean house get rid of everything that came from him and vow to yourself not to let anyone treat you like that ever again.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest that since you already know what type of person he is to ignore any comments, you know you are better than that and you just need to be the better person here because he is still trying to find a way to dominate you and you are letting him!<br>  <br>  Ask yourself these questions:<br>  Are you proud of yourself for loving yourself enough to stand up and leave him?<br>  Are you embarrassed about how long it took you to get the courage to leave him or that he continues the abusive cycle even without you there?<br>  <br>  You should be proud that you had the courage to leave him and you should be angry that he has done this to you and will eventually do the same to others.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you seek counseling and start thinking ahead more, take whatever he writes sends or whatever and delete it or ignore it.  Warn others about him if you see them in his path and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  Your life is worth so much more, you need to look forward and quit looking back.  You have the opportunity to a brighter future if you make the right choices.  Be proud of the person you are and be okay with the lesson that has been learned, now you know the signs of an abuser for the future.|`|dthpLcVbaa	I know it's hard to get over those kind of feelings, but like you said, it was a good decision to leave him and there is no reason for you to go back to. <br>  <br>  Don't corner yourself with these kind of emotion, Do you actually think there wont be anyone else who is better than him out there?  If not, then go out there and meet people, when you meet the better, you won't regret leaving him.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	It shouldnt hurt you hun. Maybe he realised that its him that has lost out in losing you. You done well in leaving him and feeling it was the best thing to do, now you just have to let go. Dont look back at the past, look forward to a brighter future without him
IPS3hWweaa	Dye her hair! That'll boost some IQ points into her pretty little head.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, have her wear a helmet.|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	Well just sounds young and immature to me.  Some people over does their jokes.  It just sounds like she's just playing around but over does it.  She's getting ready to have a baby, well every one has to grow up sometime.  Just be there and support her, because raising a baby takes alot of growing up and she's still a kid and will need to have some laughs.|`|vkY2fsAOaa	i think y'all or you should tell her how you feel tell her to grow up and stop acting stupid because she has a baby on the way. and say all jokes aside you don't want the baby to turn out like her if y'all are true friends she will understand|`|itMcT95Qaa	i think you should just tell her that if she acts dumb then she will never be normal again... just try to scare her xx|`|gIG3OBdtaa	I think u should jus be nice to her its not her fault dat she's kinda slow . **** ash u dnt got to be so mean :( jk but it really not my fault da tmy mommy dropped me on my head jk lol :)|`|mQ0wxEBFaa	Are you by chance blond too?
kYfZCy9Kaa	Actually it's a turn-on. he's going after what he wants in a way that fits his lifestyle. suggests he doesn't do just what gets him by. he creates his future to fit his needs. very go-getter-esque!<br>  <br>  as for feeling more educated, book smart, anyone can acquire and, sorry to be blunt, still be a dumb***. Find someone who is mentally on the same level on common knowledge, morals, humor, enteratinment, etc.|`|294kSBhyaa	i would not consider him less educated than me (although i'm a history major, so i think i'm smarter than most lol; just kidding!!!!). I guess i wouldnt' mind just as long as he follows through with his education. i'd want him to come with me to my school events, though, so i'd take him with me to colloquiums and stuff.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	no i dont think it really matters were u go for an education as long as it works for u. im not really sure y that would be a turn off either....|`|p9X6fX3naa	It all depends. is it a real program? or one of those programs that are just a money scam. I can't say I would consider myself more educated, I am on my way to earning my medical degree, but education is more that what is in books. <br>  <br>  If the guy is truly studying and working towards mastering his trade, then it is not a turn of, passion and hard work is def. a turn on. But if he is just taking the easy way out because he doesn't want to deal with teachers and homework and school in general, then it is a turn off.|`|mt3Af2FYaa	I am in college (almost done!! WAHOO) and my boyfriend went to job core twice. He chose to do training instead of college. I don't find this a turn off and i don't consider myself more Intelligent than him i just have a different kind of intelligence because he was trained in machining and landscaping. College is not for everyone.|`|lP04jzv6aa	no, an education is an education.|`|8xx3uk4Jaa	nope. <br>  as long as he is getting his education.<br>  it doesnt really matter.<br>  [:|`|AA12227342	It would, because the man is less likely to be hired and when he is hired he will make less money. Women are supporting guys enough as it is. <br>  <br>  How is a certificate program giving a guy more freedom than a college education? Sounds to me like the guy just can't make the grade.|`|yJd1H8C9aa	i dont see why you would think thats a turn off. the guy is getting his damn education in something that interests him. atleast the guy is getting an education and doing something with his life and not being lazy or living at home still.. and depending what he wants to do with his career in computers the guy could make more money than you.|`|1OzYqt9Haa	This definitly wouldnt be a turnoff b/c your still getting an education. Thats more than i can say for some people i know that go straight for the job or working expirece. And if its about computers thats a plus. Education is more a turn on than a turn off.<br>  <br>  <3 electronics and computers are awesome!!|`|ImnZzaRCaa	it isnt a turnoff- atleast he is doing something with his life and has drive and ambition.|`|8zd6OqJ5aa	It truly depends on the girl that you mean, Some girls like different random things.<br>  <br>  Most girls Do like educated men though. I think it shouldnt matter where you get your education from, just as long as you aren't lazy and ARE going to go somewhere with your life you know?<br>  <br>  I mean, my boyfriend is going to AI which is not a 4 year college and he also know a lot about computers. He's majoring in game design and I think it's awesome that he is into video games because so am I.<br>  <br>  I actually think it's attractivve that he's so smart about computers and even vieo games, see? rthat's a random thing to love but I do because it makes him who he is. <br>  <br>  Sorry to write alot but to answer you question more directly, if the girl isn't shallow and is a REAL person, then she won't care a bit how you are pursuing your education.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and keep up with the good work =D
FLcqhUf0aa	It sucks that brother's are just like that huh?? mine are the same.. and  in the movies when that brothers always protect the sister, it's not like that in real life. YOu know it sucks because You can tell them  that you don't like it. One: They laugh at you Two: they say there sorry that they didn't know, Three: Shake it off.. Maybe when they are older and more mature you can tell them then. It does suck i feel your pain. Just try to ignore it.

b2ZwhOqsaa	that's a really tough one. I guess now you know that marriage is a lot of work, and if he still wants to be married to you, which he does or else he would have confessed to cheating and went back to her or another woman, he obviously wants to work things out too. maybe you could start by telling him that you know he made some mistakes, and that if they Truly were mistakes, the both of you will have to figure out whats going to make each of you happy, so that it won't happen again. I think it will be a lot of work, but if you guys really want the marriage to work, there's no reason it couldn't. I think it is going to be very hard for you to get through, but keep in mind that all of it will only make you guys stronger. Going to councilling will definately help the both of you.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	actually, you might not lose your child if you divorce and your child may be the way you get to stay in the country if it comes to that.<br>  <br>  Go into counseling alone, also talk to a lawyer about your situation.  Let them know you're trying to save your marriage but you are afraid that your husband may divorce you any way and that you may have to leave the country and you're worried about losing your child.  Basically, you want to be fully informed in a worst case senario.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Dear he's already contemplated leaving. It's most likely only a matter of time. I personally would pack my bags and leave. He wants his ex back. Let him have her. My guess is that you can do better.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You shouldn't have to handle his anger and attitude- HE SHOULD. What is he some kind of five year old? He should have to account for where he was, and if he's unwilling to account for this email, he can do nothing but expect you to assume the worst. His attitude towards counseling that could help your marriage can only describe him as an ftard. You need to make this a deal-breaker. He either faces this or he faces divorce. And as a woman, why exactly are you worried about the custody? The court will bend over backwards for you.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Firstly, begin the process to find out how you wouldn't have to leave the country without your child.  Husbands come and go -- but your baby is forever, and the WORST thing would be for your marriage to come apart and you to be separated from him.<br>  As far as your husband, he's done a few things to show you he's deeply troubled.  He may not want to get these things out in the open NOW and examine what the problems are -- but eventually they'll come out and it won't be good when they do.<br>  Being that you're in a tenuous situation with your citizenship status and all, my advice is worry about protecting yourself. <br>  Best to you, Sweetie!!<br>  xoxoxo|`|W76VDFKCaa	Why would you save a marriage when your husband is still thinking about his ex and considers your marriage the biggest mistake.  It sounds like he doesn't want to be with you but he's not man enough to tell you.  You should seek counseling on your own and they can help you with your marriage.  Maybe after a few sessions, if your husband is willing to save the marriage, he will join you.|`|iKD1JUg1aa	i think even though you dont want a divorce yall need one cause you might love him but it sound like he doesnt love you back you cant force to stay in a relationship thats never going to be happy...there is no love there from him and without love coming from both sides of a relationship there is no relationship... think about it!....good luck!|`|90TmFp5Qaa	sorry to hear about your problem.<br>  <br>  Marriage is suppose to be two  ways. If one don't have feelings for the other it seldom works. From the context of his email your husband is still in love with his ex.|`|nFW8QeBsaa	Leave him before he leaves you. He is just shutting you out so he dont have to tell you that he really loves her but wants his cake and eat it too. Guys are such assholes!!|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Be careful that you don't dismiss what she is saying.  She showed you the email, that your stupid husband (sorry) wont even explain to you?  Can you imagine sending an email like that to your ex and telling him that you wont discuss it with him?  Now, he sounds like a jerk, doesn't he!  How dare him get mad at you, leave and pout because you question him about this?  Honestly, unless he changes, your marriage is a sham, because of him, not you. You can't fix what he wont acknowledge.  This woman did you a favor, don't kill the messanger!|`|Cpwedckvaa	Um...seriously?!? You need to know what is going on...He owes it to you as a partner in your marriage. I think that we all have moments of "what if" in our lives but he has taken it too far. I would demand answers to the questions and if he cannot or will not give them then you need to seriously consider other options...I wouldnt want someone who didnt want me|`|I6dIkhbOaa	Oh honey . . . this is not good. ANY time a man (or a woman) stays out all night and won't tell you where they've been it is very, very obvious what they are up to. I don't know about you but I would be hurt to the brink of insanity at this point. I am not one to cheer on the side of divorce but the honest truth is that marriage is tough enough when both people are in it 100% and it sounds like your husband isn't even almost in it 100%. You can't carry this thing on your own and if he is calling this a mistake and is all full of regret, wanting after another woman he had previously committed to? AND he is pushing you away, acting angry and refusing to seek counsel? You have a serious set of issues on your hands and you need to consider making an exit. You need to really think about whether you are willing to put up with an unfaithful, unhappy man for the rest of your life or at least until he gets the nerve to leave you. Staying with someone for the child is not always right either, especially if they are being exposed to conflict and anger between the two of you. How do you know he would get custody? Is that a legal, proven fact?

I think you deserve one you're his wife....<br>  <br>  OR you can try speaking to him calmly again - but if that doesn't work then maybe more drastic (sterner) speaking?  Remind him of his vows, that you're his wife, if he can't confide in you who can he confide in?<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if you do this, be prepared to either hear something you really don't want to hear, or to hear something that may bring you down differently (like something serious bugging him - disease, job, stress..)...so prepare yourself before you do this...I know you want to know...but part of you may not.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Children are hardly ever seperated from their Mother's unless they are deamed unfit by the court. It doesn't matter that you are not American. More than likely he would stay with you.

It is better than living with someone that doesn't love you or care anymore. I would be afraid he would come home with some kind of disease because he is sleeping around.|`|oq3PwWA0aa	This has turned into quite the conundrum.  I am very sorry that this has happened to you.

I think you should look into some type of marriage counseling even if its with your pastor.  Trust is hard to regain once broken.  I do question his ex's motive for calling you and she may very well be trying to cause a rift.  But the fact of the matter is you don't KNOW because he won't tell you. Try the counselor!  Good Luck!

MnewrjTAaa	Say, "Ah, that's because I like you.  So I get nervous."  You will find it incredibly relaxing and liberating, and she will melt.  It's very flattering!<br>  <br>  #2.  Take her hand and squeeze it!  No words necessary.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of going places and doing things together.  Yep, bowling, minigolf.  Great suggestions.  Or ask her to plan the next date.  What does she want to do?|`|FaS3CT5waa	just relax, and ask simple questions...<br>  <br>  were do you go to school<br>  have you ever been out of this state....<br>  what do you do for fun<br>  do you like partying...etc|`|HRJDrnBRaa	take some extasy before the date starts.|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	Okay you need to just relax, if she has been out with you more than once then she obviously likes you.  Now let her get to know you, be yourself.  Maybe you should try a game something that requires you to talk.  You could ask about hobbies, sports, or common interests.  Maybe she would like to go on an ultra fun date something out of the ordinary, go play laser tag maybe or to a amusement park if you are near one, even check your community calendar to see what is coming up sometimes they have fun classes that maybe you could take together. <br>  **Ideally if you have a common interest or hobby then you are home free, you will always have something new to share with one another about it.  and if you feel awkward in a silence it does not always have to be, maybe it is comfortable, its okay not to talk all of the time.|`|Y1bed2FJaa	you just have 2 stop thinking of her as a girl and start thinking of her as a friend you do that and you'll be able 2 have a relationship if u keep thinking of her as something great that puts butterflies in your stumach she will think your boring<br>  <br>  ask her questions like how her day goes or ask her what she likes and build off that iniciationg a conversation is half the battle|`|uwaAcgyiaa	To do as your doing means that you really like her, and dont want to feel embarrased or say something stupid so we freeze up.<br>  What you have to do is talk about things that she likes, basically ask her what she likes to do and hobbies, things she likes and dislikes, then ask her a question about them... so its her that does the talking, so just sit pretty and listen :).. then you will find yourself loosening up a little...<br>  And silence is essential between the two of you, it happens everyone, Its not just you, because she is silent aswell, its just that you are the fella, so you feel like its upto you to make conversation.<br>  Tips for getting out of this :<br>  1.. Ask what did she do for the day / weekend??<br>  2.. What she plans to do in life??<br>  3.. Has she any pets???<br>  4.. ask passingly about her family.<br>  5... Find out what her favourite colour is??<br>  6... MUsic she likes??  <br>  7..  Places she would like to see and go to///<br>  And so on etc etc<br>  <br>  <br>  Dont talk about money, or other people, or certainly not about past relationships... trust me<br>  The main thing is to be yourself, because that is what she liked about you in the first place.<br>  Go to places where you both feel comfortable... like shopping malls, cinema etc, becausr there is lots to grab the attention and keep ye flowing along nicely.<br>  And remember always listen  to what she has to say... always... its a clincher :)|`|6cZeMyyFaa	Aww, well you must really like her :) Basically, just relax. If you get quiet and nervous you are probably are unsure of her reaction or approval to your normal behavior.<br>  <br>  1.) If you want to stop feeling awkward, you have to stop caring what she is going to think of you and just be yourself - after all thats who she likes!<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  2.) If you want to recover from awkward silence, just go with it. Don't even let it phase you. People slip up and make mistakes and its normal. Just laugh it off or find something to break the ice. <br>  <br>  Interesting conversations have usually snowballed from a small topic. Just ask her something and let it develop from there. Try not to worry and let things come to you naturally, just go with the flow :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Mf9HMFvoaa	Well if you freeze up then just like relax a lot, just be chill around her. When you have awkward silence then, think of things you have in common, for example, music, hobbies, and ask her things she likes to do. Its really simple to start a conversation that leads to more conversations.|`|P13CpxsUaa	That's life dude. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself.<br>  <br>  Ask her out somewhere where you can have fun. Every guy takes a girl to dinner or a movie- take her bowling. Or to mini golf. Something unique like that will make you stand out from anyone else she has dated.|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	wear long johns

He never remembered it.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	leave him thats abuse he should never punch you!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	My ex brother in law used to wake up violently lashing out. There is a 3 minute window, where you wake him up, he can be violent, and you can't do anything about it. my brother in law was a really great guy when he was awake, but wake him up, and his fists would be flying.<br>  <br>  Your husband has what sounds like a mild version of a sleep disorder similar to my ex brother in laws. Seek help, a Doctor is a good start.|`|EhfGorc9aa	Sleep in another room!!! You need to get him to his doctor! If he SAT up, it sounds like he could have been awake.  How do you know he was not awake? Did he have any memory of these events?  He might be in denial of his hostile feelings toward you.  This could be a Passive-Aggressive Personality disorder.  Being "asleep" is a good excuse and has been used as a defense in the past by murderers.  You do not want to be strangled or murdered "in his sleep" so you need to get professional help right away.  You did not say where you were punched but I hope the baby is okay.  I suggest sleeping in a separate room and just blame it on his snoring.  Get him to the doctor for the snoring and alleged "sleep waking" dangerous type behavior.  His hostile feelings are being repressed and coming out in his dreams and light sleep-wake period....He could use some therapy.  Find out what he is dreaming about...I'll bet he will deny any memory.  Get help before it is too late. It is not normal or alright for a man to punch you at any time.  The physical act of punching someone would be enough to wake him up if he was not already awake.  I would be wary of him. Pay more attention to how he is doing & feeling. He may be having negative and stressful thoughts about becoming a father. Still waters run deep.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Most likely he suffers from a sleep disorder.  My husband still has night terrors and lashes outin his sleep from time to time.  Maybe you should have separate beds until the baby comes just to be careful.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Since he was asleep he didn't know what he was doing. Next time just gently nudge him. Some people are prone to outbursts that aren't characteristic of themselves.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	My wife of 24+ years has hit me twice while asleep.<br>  <br>  She was married 8 years to a ***-hole; had 2 kids; and then divorced for 8 years before we met.<br>  <br>  First hit was after during the first couple of years of our marriage - she just hit me in the face with her fist.<br>  <br>  A few years later, she hit me between the legs while asleep.<br>  <br>  At times, I can tell she is having bad dreams (about her former husband?) and she has taken those swings.  But twice in 24+ years isn't too bad.<br>  <br>  It just sounds like your husband was sound asleep and when you pushed him over, he just swung at you.  Kinda like how a baby at 2 years will hit you if you try to take a toy away.   <br>  <br>  As long as he doesn't display any anger issues (like throwing things, verbal & physical abuse of you) while he is awake, I wouldn't worry about that hit.  It probably will never happen again.|`|c55O7jqXaa	My Husband punches and kicks in his sleep. I kicked him right out of bed after he rolled over and hit my arm. He felt so very bad. I still said I couldn't have that. <br>  <br>  What happens if he had hit your tummy or something. He is probably just have nightmares or dreams. I would suggest putting something between you two. Maybe one of those large body pillows. He may be having stress over the baby coming? Could be causing him to have dreams. <br>  <br>  My Husband is a very gentle sweet guy, but he has horrible dreams at night.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	I actually did this to my wife one time.  I was completely asleep too.  In our circumstance, I was sleeping with my arms pinned between she and I.  I dreamed I was being bear hugged and in a fight.  I jerked my arm out and hit her.  It was, in no way, directed at my wife.<br>  <br>  You should not make so much of it.  It's not so weird.  It was nothing.  I am not a violent person either. LOL too small to be violent.  I would get squashed. :)|`|NGKwsawdaa	Maybe he was having a nightmare, and you scared him?|`|uF8RLL4laa	i fight in my sleep. but then, knowing that i tend to sleep alone|`|cqwaYRXFaa	sometimes people do things in their sleep they dont even noe there doing its called night terrors its a bad dream only you dont remember it....during night terrors u can experience getting up out of the bed, screaming kicking, or even eating while sleeping but majority of the time its children who experience night terrors...or mayb hes jus a rough sleeper i dont know..but if he has no re collection of doing it, it wuz probably one...im sure he didnt mean it <br>  good luck wit ur pregnacy|`|K6vEbdqxaa	My fiance started to choke me in his sleep one time.

The second I did, I saw her wind her head forward which kind of confused me for a second. I did not have time to react before she launched her head back and slammed me in the face. She did not wake up at all. Unlike you though I woke her up and was like "WHAT THE HELL". Turned out she was having a nightmare about someone chasing her, and the second I put my arm around her she said someone was wrapping there arms trying to grab her in her dream. So I suppose its more common then one would think.<br>  <br>  P.S I hope he did not hurt you.|`|9BsyKN9haa	I have hit my husband in my sleep.My husband has told me I have yelled at him and kicked him out of the bed for no reason, and I have had full conversations with him and I have no memory of, because i was asleep.

3fwJBhJdaa	If you need drugs to cope then take them as prescribed.|`|zAoKd2DBaa	This is a worrying sign, his behaviour. <br>  i was once suffering depression anxiety and panic attacks. i know how awful it is for you, i really do.  My partner told me that if i took "happy pills" he would feel it a personal insult and leave me.  So i didn't and i struggled along for ages.  I had a kind of breakdown and couldn't function any more. i then decided, after lengthy discussions with my doctor, that i would try the anti depressants, not as a long term solution but to lift me up to a place where i could start to assess what my problem was, the root of my depression and unhappiness.  so i took them and didn't tell my partner.  he found out eventually and found it necessary to tell other people my private business, and to tell my daughter that "your mom doesn't love us because she wouldn't need to take pills if she did" - nice burden for a 13 year old girl.  <br>  <br>  I found the source of my problem - him.  I dumped him when i felt better and have never ever regretted it.  I think he wanted to keep me "down" so i had no self esteem and didn't leave him. <br>  <br>  I think that you should stand up to him, tell him i need to get myself better so i have quality of life, i'm sorry if you don't like that but this is what i am going to do. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I really hope you get to feel better soon.  Don't be bullied by him.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	I strongly think you need to do what is right for you.  He is not the one who feels this endless sadness that depression brings.  <br>  If he cannot understand that you can not live with depression and he can't care enough about you to be more open about this then honestly, screw him.  <br>  You are a grown women and you can make grown up choices.  He is not your father, he has no right to tell you what you can and cannot do.|`|nFW8QeBsaa	You need to take care of yourself first, who cares how he feels it's not his body. Why should you have to be depressed because he is selfish. With or without him you are your number one priority.|`|f625761b9315ce30edb7ef310c33bf77aa	you poor thing. Thats so unfair. Even though your "drugged" at least you happy and should be al that matters. <br>  There is a therapy called neuro feedback. Its anti drugged and it helps with depression, i go every week, they hook up these wires to the places on your head where the depression is coming from,  you stare at a screen and watch a game, its a game with your brain, you control the game on the screen with your head. I don't know if you have a center near you with that, but you should look into it. THere are no side affects. I know it sounds crazy but i went for anxiety and now that i have done this for a few months, i am singing in front of people. If that does not work for you then i suggest you ask your husband how you can be happy without medication. If he knows what hes talking about so well then ask him for his suggestion. After all depression is a disease and is something you can not control. See what he says, otherwise you have every right to be happy, and you should do whatever it takes, whether its going behind your husbands back, you need to take care of yourself before you care for anybody else.<br>  <br>  good luck and best wishes<br>  <br>  <br>  feel free to email me.

Previous |  1 of 2  | Next ? <br>  <br>  If your answer is yes, you're not alone. Simmering anger is a common problem among couples with young kids. Here, help from leading marriage counselors.<br>  <br>  Chronic Anger is Common<br>  Judy Watson-Remy candidly admits what many other women won't say out loud: She's angry at her husband a lot of the time. "We both work, but I'm still the one responsible for all of the housework and the kids' stuff," says the mother of two from Brooklyn. "My husband does nothing around the house, and that really annoys me."<br>  <br>  She has plenty of company: "Chronic anger is common in a lot of marriages -- especially when a couple has young children," says Helene G. Brenner, Ph.D., author of I Know I'm in There Somewhere: A Woman's Guide to Finding Her Inner Voice. The demands of raising kids can take a toll on even the best of relationships, and when couples don't have the time and energy to work through their issues, anger and resentment can build. The result? Consider the words of one angry wife: "I used to be madly in love," she says. "Now I'm just mad."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Roots of Rage<br>  One of the most common complaints marriage counselors say they hear from angry young moms is that their husbands don't shoulder a fair share of domestic chores. And it's not just the physical labor that gets to them. Women also feel burdened by mental overload -- having to keep track of every shoe size, doctor's appointment, birthday party, and more.<br>  <br>  "When my kids were little, I owned the family to-do list," says Lisa Earle McLeod, a mother of two from Atlanta and author of Forget Perfect, a humorous self-help book for women. "I'd say to my husband, 'Do you know when their Girl Scouts meeting is? Do you even know they're in Girl Scouts?'"<br>  <br>  <br>  Other common gripes for women are that their spouses don't pay enough attention to them or are insensitive to their concerns and needs. "My husband works all day and then comes home and hangs out with the kids," says an at-home mother of three kids under age 5. "After they're in bed, he'll plop himself on the couch and watch ESPN. He doesn't even want to have a conversation with me, and that really makes me crazy. I'm with the kids all day, taking care of them. Don't I deserve to have someone take care of me once in a while?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Still, she's reluctant to tell her husband how she feels. "I don't want to be the nagging wife," she says. "I know he works hard, and he's tired, and he deserves some time to himself." Every so often, though, her simmering anger will explode into rage. "Some little thing will set me off, and I'll go crazy on him," she confesses.<br>  <br>  Explosions like that are typical. "Anger is a scary feeling for women, and they often don't feel comfortable expressing it," says Fiona Travis, Ph.D., a psychologist in Columbus, Ohio. "But they tend to hold on to their resentment, and those feelings build. Then, when things reach the breaking point, all the pain, hurt, and frustration come flooding out."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Fallout of Anger<br>  Psychologists say that women tend to experience temporary relief after an angry outburst. It feels good to release pent-up emotions, and it helps alleviate the stress that rage can cause. Ultimately, though, it's counterproductive to allow things to reach the boiling point. "What happens then is that a husband will dismiss his wife's feelings because in his eyes she's screaming like a maniac and not making sense," Dr. Brenner says. "As a result, he doesn't take her seriously."<br>  <br>  What's worse, repeated meltdowns can cause a man to withdraw even further. "Female rage can be frightening to men," says Daphne Stevens, Ph.D., a marriage and family therapist in Macon, Georgia. Males react to confrontation with physical symptoms of stress: Their blood pressure goes up, and their heart rate increases. So to avoid the discomfort, a man may simply tread carefully around his wife and her issues or avoid her completely.<br>  <br>  As couples grow distant, the first casualty is usually their sex life. "Women have little interest in sex with someone they don't feel emotionally connected to," says psychologist Rick Hanson, Ph.D., coauthor of Mother Nurture: A Mother's Guide to Health in Body, Mind, and Intimate Relationships. And husbands, despite their reputation for boundless lust, tend to avoid intimacy with wives who are mad at them. Over time, lack of sex in a marriage will deepen the estrangement and further erode the relationship. Simmering anger is also hurtful to children, experts say. When women feel resentful, they're more prone to lose their patience with their kids.<br>  <br>  Even if they do manage to keep their feelings inside, constant resentment -- and snippy comments or cold, distant glances between partners -- give children a bad example of what marriage should be like.
iVnQ4aCiaa	I would have said, "I'd rather her have filthy hands from being a child than be around your bad attitude.  I don't teach my child to be rude to people for no reason."   Then again, I have a smart mouth.|`|crxbob5jaa	Haha<br>  <br>  I'm with you<br>  <br>  I would probably have been in shock, but wish I would have said "That's why we come to the playground so we can get dirty. We don't have dirt to play in at our house. Just toys!" <br>  <br>  BTW: if Jr. didn't like dirt, what were they doing at the playgroud?  Strange mother, that one!

Wv592rOqaa	Happy to have a teacher?  In some countries there are not enough teachers - so you can celebrate Teachers Day also.
IbhX8kHxaa	I think this is a really sweet alternative!!..........................<br>  <br>  <br>  I copied this from another answer here on Y!A.................<br>  <br>  <br>  Box, Wine & Love Letter Ceremony"<br>  <br>  While there are so many traditions that a couple can incorporate into their<br>  wedding vows, such as the Unity Candle, The Rose Exchange, and many more, there is one special idea that I have recently learned about from my dear friend, Richard (Thanks Rich!) who attended a wedding in Holland. While he was not sure if it was a Dutch tradition, he found it to be extremely touching. When he returned to the states, he could not wait to share this with me. Basically the JP or officiant asks the couple getting married to find a strong wooden box that will hold two bottles of wine and two wine glasses. The couple is then asked to each write a letter to one another, expressing their thoughts about the good qualities that they found in their future partner and their reasons for falling in love with each other. Under no condition can they read each other’s letter. They are to seal them and put them in the box with the wine and glasses. Upon finalizing the wedding ceremony, the officiant will announce to the guests that he / she had asked the couple to write letters to each other and put them in the box with the wine and glasses. The officiant will explain that should the couple ever find their marriage in serious trouble, before making any irrational<br>  decisions, they must open the box, drink wine together, and read the letter that they wrote to one another to reflect on why they fell in love with each other in the first place. The hope is that there will never be a reason to have to open the box, unless of course, it is for a 25 year anniversary! At the wedding in Holland, members of the wedding party were handed nails to hammer (which I dress up with a white ribbon and bow) the box shut. However, as an alternative, I suggest that it be the couple to each take a nail and hammer the box shut (with two pre-drilled holes to make it easier to hammer), if only to add that special touchinto their wedding vows. This is only a suggestion, but I just think that it makes the ceremony extra special for the couple.<br>  <br>  Truthfully, I find this to be the most romantic (and coolest!) addition to<br>  incorporate into a marriage ceremony. Not that my husband and I needed to do this (well o.k., maybe sometimes!), but I wish that we had. It would have been fun opening it up on our 25th Anniversary!<br>  <br>  The Officiant would say the following:<br>  <br>  "Alexis & Travis, I have asked you as a couple, to find a strong wooden box that will hold two bottles of wine, and two wine glasses. In addition, I have asked each of you to write a letter to one another, expressing your thoughts about the good qualities that you have found in your future partner, as well as, your reasons for falling in love with each other. I requested that under no condition were you to read each other’s letter, and that you were to seal them in individual envelopes and put them in the box with the wine and glasses."<br>  <br>  "Alexis & Travis, should you ever find your marriage enduring serious<br>  difficulties, I am asking that before you make any irrational decisions, that you both, as a couple, open the box, drink some wine together, and then venture off into separates rooms to read the letters that you wrote to one another when you were united as a couple. By reading these love letters, you will reflect upon the reasons that you fell in love with each other in the first place. The hope here is, that there will never be a reason for you to open this box, unless of course, it is for your 25 year anniversary!"<br>  "Alexis & Travis, I now ask that each of you take a nail, one at a time, and hammer the box shut."<br>  <br>  <br>  ...................<br>  I hope you like this idea! and God Bless your marriage!!<br>  <br>  (sorry so long...)
ODORT37Paa	Never.  It's a passing fancy based on lust that will be gone in time.<br>  That word just complicates things and most guys hate to hear it.|`|ww59ahwYaa	love is an emotion not a thing you can say after a certain time period.  when you feel it say it.  go spread the love sister.|`|ISbtuWdTaa	Whenever the time is right.  There is no "set date."  Also, love should not be a word to "establish."  It should be natural and said only when you really feel it.|`|XmFT7fHnaa	only when you are Absolutely sure that you mean it the biggest turn off that i have ever encountered is a person rattling off i love you 's as if the phrase ment nothing|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	when you and guy know that you 2 love each other <br>  or just say it and see what he'll say back not on the first date or you can tell if he like you too.|`|3y56320paa	mmmmmm. wenever you feel comfortable i suppose|`|mapqQDrMaa	when you know that your in love with someone, and i dont mean love i loved my best friend after a week of meeting her, i mean in love,<br>  when you know that you would drop anything for this person if they needed you and that they would do the same exact for you.. sometimes you wont ever feel that way in a relationship, so then you shouldnt say it to that person...|`|Z1UYtOQKaa	when ever you truly feel that you love someone tell them no matter the out come of the situation. My husband told me he loved me on our first dated and we have been together for four years. So there is no time limit on how your heart feel i say there is  no time limit on things like that you cant help how your heart feels but you can make the first time that you say it special like a candle light dinner or a romantic date.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with this|`|kTVQ4QeGaa	don't break in on a girl if she's straight and unsure, take time, you know. best time is either when there is an amazing friendship which leads into chemistry, OR that rare but instantaneous spark that makes you want to rip each other's clothes off! always good times.|`|uGY1eopqaa	Whenever you truly feel it. :) I don't think anyone should be afraid to admit their feelings, or to rush into it because they feel its needed. If you truly love the person, tell them.<3|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	Whenever it feels right to you.

m81dfyOYaa	If you were married when the debt accrued it's not your ex's taxes, it's a joint bill unless it was spelled out in your divorce settement that it's his debt. 50/50 sounds fair to me.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	No. If it's HIS taxes, it's his duty to pay it not mine.|`|nFW8QeBsaa	No, he wouldn't pay mine. That is part of the divorce that he inherited.|`|ca7542594b89a18dd875dc5253650b82aa	No! only if it was before the final divorce took place! then I would only pay my 50% that is all. If it was after you need to notify IRS asap.<br>  good luck|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If you are divorced, there is no reason to pay.<br>  <br>  That said, if it is a bill in arrears from when you were still married, the right thing to do would be to pay your share.  But what moron gets divorced and doesn't address prior financial issues in the divorce action?|`|GYoNyoWtaa	No way.<br>  Because he is my EX for a reason
HSSuKNCUaa	Well, most of the time these things are so extreme. I think the extremes make it unrealistic.<br>  <br>  If you drop at someone's feet without knowing them well enough, they are not going to be interested in you because you make them feel like you're in love with love, rather than that you actually care about them. It even has very little to do with easy, it just has to do with the fact that everyone wants a partner who can emotionally take care of themselves, whose sanity doesn't depend on you.You want someone who has a healthy life of their own as well. Some people do like the chase, but that's not even about love, that's more often about sex.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, playing hard to get is highly overrated. Playing games only takes you so far, it undermines trust, and it highly depends on lust.<br>  <br>  I think the middle way is the magical path. The one where you have your own life, don't depend on other people for your own happiness, and don't give your heart away too carelessly; this makes you "not easy", but it also doesn't require playing games. Have dignity and standards and you won't seem desperate or like a player. You're just looking out for yourself, and you're flattering the other person once you let them in.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I think that you need to show interest, just not be too pushy right off the bat because that seems creepy and desperate.  Such as wanting to hang out nonstop when you just meet and not accepting legitimate excuses, giving over-the-top compliments, etc <br>  <br>  Playing hard to get often confuses people and makes them think that they're wasting their time.  Especially as people start to grow up.
BbWk7RNgaa	Yes.  Well, I tell my 8 year old daughter that she can't have a boyfriend until she's 30.  Do I mean it?  Of course not.<br>  <br>  Some of her expectations are unrealistic.  How can she expect you to be a succesful banker and have babies?  One woman can only do so much!  And one man yr whole life?  I've certainly not met anyone that lucky.<br>  <br>  What I would do is, since yr only 13, is nod and smile, especially about the boyfriend, man, sex thing.  What she probably wants to know for sure is that you're not experimenting now.  It is important to be sure, you can really get hurt.  Go out in a group with your guy and girl friends, and if there's one you really like, take it slow.  He might be a sleaze and you wouldn't know it until too late, right?<br>  <br>  If she tells you what she wants your career to be, tell her 'we'll see', or 'that sounds good, but I'd like to keep my options open'. or even, 'this other job sounds like it would be enjoyable and make just as much money, so maybe I'll do that instead, but it's too early to tell.  As long as I do well in school I'll have lots of choices, right?'<br>  <br>  Above all, stay in school, work hard, don't get pregnant until you're sure you want to.  That will give you the most options in your life.  Just remember that it is your life, and no one can live it for you.  If it's unbearable, make sure you can move out when you reach the age of majority.  Then you can make something of yourself on your own terms.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Smile and nod, then plan out your future how you want it to be.  There's no point in arguing with her.  Besides, she can't control your body or your life, especially after you are 18.  She can tell you what she hopes for you, but the rest is up to you.|`|9Ve6jDSyaa	Is she hard core or some one you can talk to? If she is hard core then oblige her till you go to college. Try thinking of your future and what you want to do, plan it out. Talk to her about your plans for the future. Here are some ideas; going to high school, graduate, go to college in another country, studying something intellectual and that you want to stay focused on these thing so you are not going to mess it up with marriage and kids until you have completed your goals then should a man worthy of your love comes along then you will consider marriage. After that it's up to you and him about children. Just give her something to curve her concerns of you being wild and losing your future.|`|mQ0wxEBFaa	To make things easy, just nod your head and agree.  You don't have to mean it.  After 18, she can't control what you do anymore anyways.  You're on your own terms.  Until then, just tough it out.  Relationships at this age generally don't last anyways.  But if you really want a boyfriend just be sneaky about it.  Say your going to the movies with a group of friends and then meet up with him there.  She's just being protective and at your age it's normal for parents to do that.  Just keep moving along and do well in school.  Keep your family close though because when day you'll leave home and you'll probably miss  them.  Adios|`|RvoKIlrdaa	tell her it's your life its unfair to live on an ajenda really boring <br>  And unfun tell her it's your own tight rope to walk and tell her that you want her there when youre falling|`|S2pl3HNGaa	whoa sucks 4 u LOL|`|WwWhSBCxaa	shoot her in the head

4j2P6YFhaa	you deserve so much better than this girl. maybe she does like you, but is obviously too stuck up to admit to it. try to forget about her. do things to take you're mind of everything. maybe join a club out of school. you need to prove to yourself and to the horrible people in your life that you deserve better. if it is impossible to forget about this girl, don't make it obvious. so don't stare at her or even smile at her. ignore the people that are horrible, because they will end up picking on you even more if you speak back to them. <br>  <br>  do you know what you want to be when you're older? what job do you want? this will cheer you up a lot. take you're mind of the present and look at the future. do you wish to travel the world? for some people (and i think this is me too), the younger years of your life are the worst. the best years can be when you have left school. look ahead at that and just say to yourself when you're feeling low "when i am older, my life will be better".<br>  <br>  organise you're life out for when you're older and when you eventually know what you want to be, you'll be so exited!! just remember, you have you're whole life to choose a girl, do NOT worry about it now, focus on your school studies to help you into the career you wish to pursue.<br>  <br>  i realise that the majority of this information is irrelevant, but whenever i feel low, i always try to imagine my career i am looking forward to greatly, and i feel so much better. good luck, and believe me when i say it - this girl is not worth it.

It's part of being 35, hell, it's part of life.  But think about your life a month ago today - was it better?  Yes/No?  See, it changes so much - there is MUCH MORE good than bad, I promise you that.   Also remember, you are 14, and at 14 you know that logically and scientifically speaking, you are bound to be a little more emotional about things than say, someone who is 35. So breath, calm down.  <br>  <br>  No one hates you - if you like your new look then keep it.  If your friends think your clothes mean that YOU as a person have changed, then your friends are a little dumb.  <br>  <br>  Work on getting your grades up, kinda pour yourself into school work for a while, pull back from the friends.  Take about a week "social vacation" and take care of YOURSELF and get your grades up - ask your teachers if you can do any extra credit.  Then, after you take care of the that issue, call a few of your friends, one at a time and tell them how you feel and that you are sorry if you seem like you don't  care but that you DO care and that their friendship means alot to you. Explain how you feel.  <br>  <br>  Parents and teen-agers are forever at odds, that's probably not going to change, but just remind yourself they love you and you love them and that's about as much as you can do there.  Talk to them, too.  Mom's can sometimes help more than you expect. <br>  <br>  Also - maybe talk to a school counselor?  You're school hopefully has at least one.  Go talk to them, just talk.  It's better than posting here and they are better trained than we are  =) <br>  <br>  When I was a freshmen I lost ALL my friends over a guy I dated and I survived.  I had NO one.  My dad was gone and my mom thought I was a drama queen.  I made it.  My friends came around (they took a little time to get over being "ticked") but during that time I read A LOT and got my grades up and it was lonely, but I made it just fine.

If your friends dont want to work things out and be around you i dont think they are good friends in my opinion. They should be the ones making you feel better and comforting you. If their are problems at home i think everyone should get together for a long talk. Dont fall in love at the age of 14 because it will mess up your whole life. It has happened to me but im 15 now. Once love has been crushed at a young age it will be harder to find love in the future. Take this from someone with experience. Hope you the best.

If you want to have a big orgie, then separate and date 4 other people.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Never done it. Never will.<br>  <br>  Fantasy is one thing. Reality is another. You can never take it back. Ever.|`|TGRKbQMVaa	This is a sick thing.|`|29hcn9JRaa	Are you aware that most couples who either stray or desire group sex are twice as likely to not have loyalty towards their spouse? Loyal behavior and thinking is the glue that holds a marriage or relationship together, so to go out and have sex with a stranger for sexual gratification is stomping on any loyalty you have towards your spouse. The only people who are going to tell you to go for it and endure group sex are either the punk teenagers who come on here, or the nutcases. So take the advise of a straight up normal woman, that of course is me, don't do this, you will find yourself overwhelmed with disgust and regret. I personally know of one person who did this, he told me that the idea of it, the fantasy of it was so different then the actual act of it. He told me that after the act was done, that he felt dirty and grossed out by this,  he claimed that the room they were all in wreaked of this scanky smell, gee what do you think that was? he claims he still mentally smells this smell and starts to feel ill , he also claims it ruined his sex life, he and his wife ended up seeking marital counseling, however ended up in a divorce. His ex wife currently has stds, which were not from the one night of group sex, but from a different time, regardless her actions and desires to push the envelope a little further and further ended up being very costly. Regrardless understand, this was and still is a nice 33 year old guy, who had everything going for him, but this one night, this fantasy that he had such a desire for, ended up turning into a nightmare. I am warning you, fantasy is one thing, however pushing the envelope into turning fantasy into reality may come with a expensive price tag?    P.S  My dear friend, can a fat lady sit and watch a person devour a piece of  cake after 3 days of being on a diet? can a junky go through withdrawals while watching his friend shoot up? Please, get out of denial, you are not going to sit back all nonchalant while other people are getting it on. You know what? I think your going to do this one way or another, however I am also thinking you were under the impression that more people would take your side and show approval, as people who do bad things always like to hear what they want to hear. After your done with this insane, stupid thing, make sure you get yourself a lifetime supply of penicillin, as you are gonna need it.|`|uUYdkjCFaa	While some people on here have chosen to tell you not to do it and given you examples of how it can mess up your married, let me tell you my opinion on this.  Even if this between you and your husband heat up while watching.  Tall it out thoroughly with your husband before the time comes.  Make sure you have a word or some other signal that you are getting uncomfortable and would like the two of your parts to end.  Also just because you want to watch or even join does not mean there is anything wrong with your relationship with your husband.  We have both in the past had relationships where these situations have happened and to be honest the situation isn't what broke up those relationships, it was other things all together.<br>  <br>  But I will say this in closing.  It is up to you on what you do.  If you and your husband BOTH want to do this do it.  If you don't feel comfortable with it now that it could be more than just a fantacy don't do it and buy a porn.  Don't let anyone talk you into something you are uncomfortable with.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have known several couples who have either watched another couple or included others in their relationship.  They are still happily married.  You have to trust you spouse 100%, you have to have a stop signal or word for when it gets to be too much, you have to have talked it out thoroughly, and you have to understand that it does change things.<br>  <br>  I personally have recently talked with my husband about this because of something we saw on TV a while back.  We haven't had it come up in our relationship, but thought it a good time to talk about it.  We decided that if it ever did come up that we would discuss it farther, but neither of us are ruling anything out (we believe as soon as you say never the situation will show itself).  We've talked about the positives of the experience and the negatives.  We've talked about how it makes us feel and why.  We've talked about the terms if the situation ever arises.  We've left pretty much no stone unturned with this topic.|`|hjAsZP22aa	F/33 Group sex is not healthy you can become pregnant and don't know if the father is your husband or the other man.

Letting one's loved one know what you like in bed requires honesty and patience. One's desires also change over time. Sexual communication is thus an evolving process. Improving how one talk sabout love making will increase the closeness of the relationship and make it more likely to last!<br>  <br>  Knowing one doesn't Know Everything<br>  Every woman and man is unique in terms of how they like to be touched. Even if one has a wealth of sexual experience, one may not understand how this particular partner feels. Some enjoy rough play; some gentle. Some like frequent sex; some irregular intercourse. Some women can orgasm with mild manual stimulation; some require the use of sex toys. Not presuming one knows what one's partner likes is the first step to asking them what they want.<br>  <br>  Asking the Right Questions<br>  Begin by touching your partner gently and, while you’re doing so, asking them what they like. Do you enjoy having your nipples squeezed? Do you like your neck nibbled? Is this enough pressure on your clitoris? Are deep thrusts comfortable for you? Once they let one know what they appreciate in bed, remember, this doesn’t mean that one’s range of sexual desires doesn’t have to be reviewed throughout a relationship. It does mean that one's partner wants to feel heard. It can be annoying and a turn-off to have to answer questions every time one has sex. Even more frustrating is feeling that the lover wasted her time letting a partner know what she likes only to have him forget!<br>  <br>  Being Open minded and Non-judgmental<br>  Along with feeling heard, most people want to feel that their desires are normal, or at least acceptable. Some women and men enjoy being tied up during sex, or like visual stimulation, or appreciate the use of a range of toys. Even if one isn't experienced in this practice, the worst response one can have is disgust, shock or other signs that you are disturbed by their desires. If one loves or cares about the person, one will want them to feel good in the way that makes them happy. While one doesn't have to do anything that makes one feel comfortable, neither should anyone make a loved one feel odd or unclean for enjoying those forms of arousal. Most importantly, make all sexual partners feel good about their bodies and never draw attention to their flaws. Being criticized for things one cannot change is the ultimate turn-off.<br>  <br>  Maintaining Care and Trust<br>  If an individual feels that his partner really cares about him, he's more likely to be able to tell her what he likes. Knowing that one's significant other wants to listen, learn and expand the pleasures of one's sex life will increase the openness. A solid level of trust helps one to feel that they won’t share this information with others outside the relationship, betray you or deliberately hurt you. Sexual communication is sure to improve and with it, the overall quality of the relationship.<br>  <br>  Read more: "The Importance of Sexual Communication: Improving Relationships by Increasing Care" - <a href="http://improving-relationships.suite101.com/article.cfm/the_importance_of_sexual_communication#ixzz09HAdtrT1" rel="nofollow">http://improving-relationships.suite101....</a>

It's like two different lives. When I was young I was 14 and liked a 23 year old. Looking back at it you really think the guy must have been pretty sick in the head to have liked me back. When you get older you'll think it's gross. I never did anything with the guy, not even kiss but still just the fact that he hung out with someone so much young is pretty gross in it self. Just like you said you are more mature, you will find a guy around your age who is also more mature.|`|9xFZo7kZaa	Well by what my mom says you probably should range in 14-16. Be sure that he doesn't act to mature. Hope it helped. ????LOVE YA????|`|MiC6j7Huaa	It seems fine, just don't sleep with them.

Vp1Wzu07aa	Their auto insurance might pay for it. Some do, some don't. If they have homeowners insurance or renters insurance that will definitely pay for it. <br>  <br>  I think telling everything at once is the best idea. Rather to get it all out and not prolong the angry reaction. Do not give them much time in between. It is better to deal with all the anger once than to deal with two instances of anger.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Only if it was inside the car or trunk.|`|1TSMdgG1aa	The car insurance won't cover it.  It's your mode of transport yes, but it's not a car.  If it were a motorcycle or a moped then it can be insured under their car insurance.  But a regular bicycle? No.  <br>  <br>  They're gonna be really ticked off because it was an expensive bike, first of all. But I think they'll be more worried about the fact that you skipped school. Your best bet is just to come out with it. Whatever they say you need to face it and take responsibility.  If you let them know that you'll accept and comply with whatever punishment they choose for you, you'll start to show them that you're really sorry.  It'll also show them that you're acting like a grown up, and they may start to trust you again.  <br>  <br>  Good luck there buddy!|`|AA10667393	If it was stolen from the house, homeowners' insurance might cover it. Your failing to lock it up might give the insurer an out. If it was stolen while on a bike rack on the car, the car insurance might cover it, but your failure to lock it up might give the insurer an out.<br>  <br>  If the insurance pays, it will pay the market value of the bike when it was stolen, not what it cost and not the replacement cost (unless the insurance policy says it will pay replacement cost).<br>  <br>  If I were a parent, I would be more upset about you missing school. The bike is your problem.|`|AazkuVzqaa	It depends where you live, but I am pretty sure their car insurance won't pay for it, since it wasn't well a car.  Just be in for some yelling, they will probably think you are irresponsible for not locking the bike up and might not get you another one.  And as far as skipping school that is just another reason for them not to trust you.|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	Car insurance won't pay for it, but, theres a good change that their homeowner insurance will. You'll just have to check.
09Y8F6hQaa	He doesn't want to marry you, but he still wants to have sex with you.  That is the honest to God truth.  After 2 yrs., he should know if he wants to marry you or not.  Ask him and be prepared for the answer.  Then, act accordingly.  I think he's stringing you along until someone better comes along (better according to him).|`|gpoi6GKtaa	he may not want to get married- at all but talks about things like marriage and children to compensate for your feelings- talk to him about what you want for your future- a commitment ceremony may be better for the two of you- it's the lesser of marriage and who knows- maybe even eventually he may change his mind.   talk to him about it and get his take.  did you ever stop to think about asking him why he does not want to marry but yet still discusses the "when i get married..." topic?|`|O3EtP4vOaa	The others may be right, he may just not see your relationship moving to marriage.  <br>  <br>  I tend to think guys will generally say I don't want to get married because if they say they do they are afraid you will expect it right now.  And clearly he is not ready now.  If you love him then continue loving him.|`|3fwJBhJdaa	Don't waste your time.

When a guy sends you mixed signals like that what he is telling you is he doesn't want to marry YOU.<br>  <br>  It's now up to you to decide if you're wasting your time with him. <br>  <br>  Do you want to get married?  He's not marriage material for you, it's time to move along.<br>  <br>  Do you not care about getting married?  then stay and enjoy his company until he meets the woman he wants to marry and leaves you.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	If he says "I don't want to get married" then listen to him.  He is not lying to you.  Figure out whether you want to get married or not, and if you do, then stop wasting your time with him.  If you are happy with the way things are with him, then enjoy each other.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I'm not guessing what your boyfriend means, I'd only have a 50/50 shot of being right.  The bottom line is that if you have gotten to the point that you are intimate with this guy than you should be at the stage that you can talk / discuss important issues with him (and what you both want out of life).  I'd daresay you should be fairly certain this is the man you want to marry & he has made it known he is interested in the possibility of marrying (you) before putting out..but thats a subject for another time.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Their only a waste of time if you want to get married.  If you can be happy with someone without a piece of paper issued by the government and an extra piece of over priced jewelry then no they're not a waste of time.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	After 2 years he should have some clue about your future together...seeing as he couldn't date girls closer to his own age (because marriage would have been a hot topic...) he chose someone younger that he could string along...<br>  <br>  IMO - he isn't going to marry you...|`|c55O7jqXaa	I would take that as he doesn't want to gte married to you. Maybe he thinks you wouldn't make a good wife. I suggest you ask and then move on now.
uwaAcgyiaa	Actaully that cant be answered unless i saw you, because evry person is different... for instance i like brunettes, and the way they wear their hair depends on the shape of there face and looks, also what you wear depends on your body type, i like clothes that fit neatly and grasp the curves of a girl.....<br>  So every one is attracted to different things.. men usually go for looks and sexyness first, so wear what makes you look this way, and not something that is just different from other girls..<br>  And dont under dress as this may make you look easy and the like.<br>  Basically it does not matter how intelligent you are or things like that, we like different things, one might find it nice, but the next might not.<br>  <br>  The usual is good looking, nice curves, funny/ fun and dresses upto date, and takes pride in her appearance.. take iot easy on the make up though|`|CHazGLY3aa	for starters I luv your screen name, luv sweet cherry pie!<br>  <br>  1 - straight hair<br>  2- tight pants<br>  3 - blonde<br>  4 - smart girl, A's and B's<br>  5- funny and likes to have fun<br>  6 - normal, more on the skinny side though, but i like curves too<br>  7 - with highlights<br>  <br>  what kind of guy do you like?
cGbTJobeaa	Of course I would strip for my husband if he asked.  Actually, he doesn't even have to ask, I do that anyway.  When we're at home alone, I'll even flash him just because.<br>  <br>  If he asked for more physical affection, i would indulge him.  Although, it would be difficult to be more physical towards him than I already am.  He loves having his head scratched or getting foot massages. If we're watching TV together, I frequently have either his head or feet in my lap.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Well for us, we r having a good and understanding love and intimate relationship, understanding each other is very important so is respect,  and above both is LOVE, wen these r there everything else is easy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Yes, I'd enjoy more time with my wife, and stripping would be great.<br>  <br>  My wife hates pleasing me in any sexual way, it seems to cause her pain, whereas she seems to become elated when consciously NOT doing those things, ie. she likes thinking that she could do them, but she won't.<br>  <br>  Sort of like the US government knowing that we could blow up Cuba, but we won't.  It's a lovely, powerful aphrodesiac.|`|9KIICFdIaa	Yes, either way. If she wanted me to strip for her or for her to strip for me, i'm all for it. Couples who play together love together.|`|yb01tlviaa	ok, im not a guy and i KNOW the answer to that.  OF COURSE they would enjoy it, men think with their ***** so they would love it.<br>  <br>  As for me, I would definetely do it, both of them.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Yeah yr kinda right in that, some people here just to have some fun reading specific things for what they r interest in, and when they want to answer they dont c it from the asker side of view to give time to understand and give the needed help, some r here for just killing time, and others here to help, sometimes and because we r used to check it here, we dont have the spirit to help so we say anything, these things might happen, but when we know that people ask questions here because they need help we will be able to give better answers.<br>  <br>  For me am here to help with any way i can, and when i feel am being not useful i close my pc and give it a break.<br>  <br>  Wish i answered yr question the way u wanted, but this is my opinion here to how people r handling questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I hope you don't take this as me "bashing" you, but I think your perceptions are skewed.  Most of the people who answered the second question were helpful.  For example, several suggested instructional videos on YouTube.  Many questions do get bashers, even mine.  (Pretty much 100% get bashed whenever username INTERNET HATE MACHINE is out and about, by the way.)|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Look, in ANY forum you're going to find people who agree with your perspective & others who don't.  It doesn't make them right or wrong - it's just an opinion.  I read #1 & #2 and found that the answers for #2 were like 95% supportive saying things like "go girl!" or " your husband is so lucky!" - so why the whining?  You seriously care that maybe 5% of the answers weren't jumping up & down in support?  They just have their own opinions and you have to be strong enough in yourself to not let it bother you.  Believe me, I've seen FAR RUDER comments made towards people.  I don't tend to give those kinds of answers but boy....there are some on here who let it fly!!!|`|jBigEy0Caa	I would not take it personally.  People tend to jump to conclusions with limited information.  Some of the responses are kinda funny and other ones are just plain opinionated & offensive.  Like someone else said just ignore those who are on their soapbox.  We all have our opinions and some people can't control their fingers.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Sorry you didn't get the right answers your looking for but on a public forum we have to ignore some answers and go with what we think is best. If you think its abusive then report them other wise you will just have to take the answers you get. I don't think anyone is judgmental, they just answers in the way they see the question.|`|303awSCYaa	yes|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	I think FAR too many people try to cram their beliefs down everyone else's throats rather than legitimately answer the question.  For instance, I am a religious person, but I don't put a religious spin on everything.
IPS3hWweaa	Actually, I prefer to do the cooking. No offense, but its really fun to cook a nice meal for someone, it makes dinner extra special.<br>  <br>  But if you were to cook something for me I'd go for lemon chicken with steamed veggies and some bread sticks. Or how about spicy fish tacos with fresh salsa and a side of spanish rice with veggies mixed in.|`|cfFlf1EAaa	Thats a hard question because every guy don't eat the same thing. What I like he can be allergic 2. So I really can't say what you should cook. But what you should do is ask him what his favorite meal is then do it 4 him.
D3hYbsVJaa	It counts. Just because he couldn't get his equipment to cooperate doesn't mean he wasn't trying. I guess eh just happened to be nekkid in the same room with this woman (whatever). Make your own decision about what to do with him, but he pretty much sucks.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Of course he was cheating, the only reason he didn't consummate the act was because he couldn't.Tell him to look for a smaller woman next time. This is a joke, right.|`|vFCva8R5aa	He could'nt tell she was fat before it got to that point? <br>  <br>  Yes it is cheating and he will continue to prowl until he finds one he can "get it up" with.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Yes it's cheating. He made the effort whether he could follow through or not. Now's the time to pack your bags and go your own way. Sorry!|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	of course it counts as cheating. he obviously did **** with her that hes not telling you...fore play...kissing...touching...if my boyfriend ever kissed another girl while we were together his *** would be grass. why on earth are you still with this man? he obviously doesn't love you for you. it sounds like he only liked you because of your weight which is ****** up. i'm sure he was able to get hard but was probably felt bad for doing anything with this women. get rid of him!|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	I would say it does, he wanted to do her and could not.  Since he tried and could not, he will try with another woman again.  It is time for either counseling or moving on.  Good Luck|`|gfHutvEFaa	Well, if he would have been able to get an erection, he would have done it so yes, it counts as cheating.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Picture this: he's naked with the full intent for going at it but the whale blubber gets in the way. What do you think??|`|tsBL19qzaa	I hope you don't really believe what you are saying.<br>  Yes, it counts!|`|TGRKbQMVaa	Get real, its cheating.|`|THivEt0Paa	Well lets see...he was there, naked with full mind-set to do the deed!! So Yes I would say he was cheating!!|`|AA11755944	yeah, it is cheating.|`|d942a137c6eecec81731fde38d574760aa	Absolutely YES it is cheating. He had the intention. He also would've had the dynamics been right. He did something inappropriate with a woman that is not his wife.. it's cheating. Intimacy is only supposed to be shared with you. A good question to judge this by is "would he have done this had I been standing next to him?". If the answer is no... then there is a problem.|`|nxi6ODkAaa	Im sorry girl but he doesnt want you. Hes obviously feels like hes missing out on something with you so he tried to find it. Lets say she wasnt fat and he did get hard,,,more than likely he would have cheated..|`|HOjwnpmUaa	Is this a joke?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Totally cheating.  Disrespectful of you and the marriage.<br>  <br>  I'd be gone so fast he wouldn't know what hit him.<br>  <br>  (Not being able to get it up does not negate the fact that he was naked with another woman.  Of course it was cheating.)|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Yes, it was cheating. If she was skinny, and he could get it up, it would have been 'slam dunk' baby!!
X6gAFO6daa	He probably doesn't like the teacher. She must have did something to him like hurt his feeling or gave him a bad grade that would make him rebel against her, so talk it over with her.
mt3Af2FYaa	My opinion is this:<br>  <br>  He was stating that he only wants a certain breed. I am sure he did not intend for the comment to sound controlling but it did. I would interpret that he only wants that breed and no other will do. I would talk to him and tell him that if its a dog you are going to share then you have a right to get what you want as well and he should compromise with you. Otherwise i would get two dogs. One you want and one he wants. Hope this helps.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	I mean if you two are planning on getting a dog together. You both should be able to have some imput in the decision. He shouldn't just say "well this is what i want, if you dont want that kind then too bad" Cause that wouldn't fly with me. i think the two of you should sit down and discuss this. He shouldnt be the only one to decide what kind of dog. Thats crazy. You both should be able to throw some ideas out there and compromise.|`|igrdohopaa	Yeah. Wow hes rude

qTTAoEWPaa	This is a situation that is going to take a lot of Patience. If it was honestly a stupid mistake she made, then she really is sorry. She shouldn't expect you to forgive and forget right away but there really is nothing you can do directly.<br>  It just takes time to heal and thats all you have to do. <br>  Honestly, its up to her to gain your trust back...|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Sorry to say if she cheated on you she's not worth a second chance.<br>  But if you really want to build up trust its going to be in the back of your mind will she do it again.But if you do I suggest a short break, its something she will have to prove to you. You have nothing to prove to her!<br>  If she stays in and tries to remain friends and fix the problem only then can you start a new. If not she's not worth the hassle.|`|vtafeEIJaa	give her second chance|`|oB1WQJHgaa	sorry but once a cheater always a cheater. I tried tthe whole trust you again thing. it wont work, and the next time she cheats it will be worse.... :(
IPS3hWweaa	Yes, he does like you, but try not to have sex with him every time you see him, because it might be the sex he likes and you not quite as much. If he still wants to see you and talk to you even when he knows he isn't going to get sex, then you know for sure that he likes you.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	he might be using u for sex! don,t let him take advantage of you|`|0VkZ70f2aa	just chill and see what happens.. i mean you guys aren't getting married yet.. it was a date that got maybe a little carried away being that it was the first date. but now just go with the flow.. i mean if it doesn't work out i'm sure you won't be in total depressant mode. just see what happens, you got nothing to lose|`|mFZeEm9paa	Alright, so I did the same thing once even though I wasn't the type either. I met this guy on Myspace we talked back and fourth for a few weeks, and on the phone, and finally decided to meet for dinner, well after dinner, we were getting along so well, we decided not to call it a night and headed to a bar.....well I had a few too many and wound up sleeping with him. I thought he wouldn't call and I thought he must think that I am a slut, but instead his feelings for me were genuine. It has been over 2 years now and I am getting married to him next month! We joke about it sometimes, but he doesn't think any less of me for doing it. <br>  <br>  Have fun in your new relationship, and if it doesn't bother your new bf then don't let it bother you. Stuff like this happens to all of us weather we admit it or not. I do not think that this guy is playing games, and I don't think that you need to chill. Just roll with it and see what happens.|`|CuJjdTVXaa	Just be yourself. You explained to him how you feel and things turned out fine, he seems to want to spend time with you and regardless of what happened the first time you can always say NO....enjoy your time together and maybe it will turn into something really nice...good luck|`|kItRaRmlaa	ooopssssssss sorry for u!! big mistake|`|d49b2cc5c58297429ad75267c3facb19aa	seems like he wants you two to work of which if u also do it might go a long way <br>  it also seems like you are so into him, i think if u get to know him better get the boat rowing maybe what happens maybe be great for both of u but dnt think so much though that will make you think twice just take it easy with him|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Good for you on the protection front..<br>  <br>  The trouble with your question is if a guy is feeding you lines, he will say he isn't.<br>  <br>  If he isn't, he will say he isn't.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you had one of those magic evenings.  You are adults, you can do what you will.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you take his word for his feelings.<br>  After all, if he posted this question, what would you have to say, what if he thought you were playing him.. How would 'prove' it to him.<br>  <br>  The only answer is time..<br>  <br>  We get jaded in society today, so many people not being honourable, but there has to be some of us out there..<br>  <br>  I think you are good..<br>  <br>  Enjoy dating..|`|qzVGaVWgaa	just dont bring up the fact that you usually dont do that anymore, you slept with him and he is being honestly interested and wants to see you more.  and JUST because you slept with him the first date, does not mean you are obligated to on the second or third or fourth, so don't feel the pressure.  just enjoy this new relationship and go out, have fun, and see if you two are compatible|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Sounds like he likes you ... you'll have to play it by ear though.  Some guys do lead girls on to get regular sex.<br>  <br>  But all of my guy friends have told me that it doesn't really matter when she puts out if he actually liked her to begin with.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	if u want to see if hes playing u DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH HIM the next time u see him lol that way if he gets pushy u will no|`|bglr4m0Naa	I think he's using you.|`|AA10500537	you made a big mistake ,|`|AA11755944	see what happens.|`|Ff6HLBxdaa	This is what happens if sitauations like this.<br>  Cause your now his booty call, what you should do is go out with him a few more times but don't sleep with him. This should show that if he really likes you, but if he doesn't you won't hear from him.<br>  Which could be a good thing.|`|e48iAjH3aa	How old are you guys?<br>  <br>  Well, now that you guys did the deed, I'd hold off from having sex with im<br>  for the next couple dates, just to get to know each other better, you don't want the relationship to be based on sex all the time, and this will be a great way to see if he's interested in getting to know you more or just having sex.<br>  good luck!|`|qkknzSlDaa	I mean see what happens. I might not be that bad. I mean it doesn't sound like hes playing with you because most guys if they were in it just for that they wouldn't have called and still be talking to you. So i think it might be a good thing.|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	just chill and roll with it, it sounds like he likes you and he is calling like he says he will.  BUT I would hold off on any other encounters for a few more dates, try a couple of dates without drinking and see how those go.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I don't know if he's playing you or not, but my advice to you is... The next couple of times you go out with him DON'T sleep with him. If he still continues to call and ask you out then i think he really does care for you.|`|2Sbq3JNbaa	No one who is playing a girl puts that much effort into it. Most of the time the players give you that treatment BEFORE you sleep with him.  Getting it after signals he genuinely likes you.|`|N8wNmQShaa	Chill and see where it goes, by giving sex the first date, he will expect it every time.|`|7a7a8b25f6c8edb1f3143b162357b855aa	i say see where it goes...<br>  you never know till you try, right?<br>  <br>  answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309094835AAAOGEA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Ly1YUt42aa	dont sleep with him after ur next date and see how he reacts,<br>  then you will know.|`|LNeSlzCCaa	He is into you---don't get to caught up at first take your time feel out the situation----MY BF and I have been together 2 yrs. we slept together on the first date--crazy bar night..LOL|`|tjA819rXaa	Well if you know her than I thank that is fine.|`|n9HUANkiaa	sounds like he likes you|`|jzlARaj3aa	he wants to **** u again u must be good at it :)<br>  mind if i have a go?|`|07L1TwNraa	If we wants to go out or chill with you again, definitely go for it. Guys don't do things like send emails saying how much they've been thinking about you if it isn't true. We are too lazy to be faking that crap :)<br>  If you chill again and he doesn't pressure you too hard for sex, then its legit.|`|651e1ee6ad591c873f721e0ec3f034b2aa	There are two kinds of guys.  Open minded and closed minded.  The open minded ones are adult enough to judge you as the 'whole person' and not write you off because you slept with them on the first date.  That is a good sign for a future relationship.  On the other hand it is human nature to appreciate more the things that haven't come too easy.<br>  <br>  Girls simply learn not to do it too soon because there are so many guys with a double standard who will think they are whores and write them off if they don't have to work hard to get in their panties.  When girls are attracted to a guy they want to do it too, it's just nature, it's not always a good idea though so we use our heads (we are better at than than the guys).<br>  <br>  Guys also sometimes wait before they try, to show the girl they are serious but I would just say time will tell,  better not to do it with most guys too soon just to be on the safe side.|`|GH1w2LVdaa	i think he likes you and wants to keep seeing you. Spend sometime during the day OUTSide lol and see how things go ! hang out and get to know each other Me and my b.f has sex after 3 dates and we have been 2gether for 3 years|`|Wl4TRRS6aa	ok.. it sounds lik he liks u.. but now.. dont go all overbore n have sex on da second date lol<br>   wait n c how he's about.. if actually listens toy you and you guys have smart conversations then and he doesnt talk about sex all the time, that will give u a clue of what he wants.. <br>   <br>  <br>  ait n c wat hes about.. n GOOD dat u used protection!!! =] goodluck|`|Z9llKxssaa	Just have sex with him every chance you get, -1 time a week.  That will keep him wanting it, because it won't be easy, but then he will marry you.  at that point, you can stop having sex with him, and he can try to buy your sexy time.  At that point, go find another guy you can sleep with, and then maybe divorce guy #1 after about 5 years and marry guy #2, and then start over.|`|63GLryA3aa	hey there,follow your first impression.if he was inexperienced and you were the one with experience,well,it maybe was just a fantasy.not too many guys have that approach.i like it and it's true in some cases.if you both like each other,why not get drunk and screw.i am a buffet fan.see ya.|`|9a86cee05b741ba44480857805bfdf5faa	I don't think he would go through all this trouble and take the time to call and everything and ask you to call if he wasn't interested. Dont let your gaurd completely down but dont be too cautious, give him a chance, To me he seems to like you.|`|brKp7aF6aa	he seems like a good guy, i guess. I mean most of the time they dont call or dont answer when you call when that happens on the first date, but who knows he could turn out to be a good guy. Just pace yourself and see where it takes you. Good luck.|`|lfNUgNl7aa	this is nothing personal but he soundslike a stalker so ust avoide him  and stop calling its better for you soon he will be asking  yout to move in with him so  just do the right  thing and dont call  back|`|S3bbOKvcaa	try  to  skip sleeping  with him  further  couple of times  ...   but  behave the way u  used to  ...  i u like him the way he is behaving .. go ahead ...
cP03k3cXaa	Groups Discussing compulsive lying | Yahoo! Groups<br>  <br>  pure_o_ocd (911 members, Moderated)<br>  This is a group for people with obsessive compulsive disorder whose compulsions are primarily mental in nature. This is commonly given the misnomer "Pure O" or "pure obsessional" because the compulsive behavior is less visible to outsiders and occasionally goes unnoticed even by the sufferer. Obsessions frequently include but are not limited to a fear of harming others or oneself, doubts about sexual orientation, fear of being a sexual deviant or predator, fear of not understanding others or of being misunderstood, obsession with personal past or pasts of others, fear of lying, and fear of death and disease. Mental compulsions include but are not limited to seeking reassurance from others or from within, confessing, thinking "neutralizing" thoughts, retracing or replaying events, checking for sexual arousal, and "mental checking" or intentionally bringing up an obsession to see if it still produces anxiety. This group is a non-judgemental safe place to discuss the OCD experience and help each other achieve better mental health through information and understanding. There is no doctor in this group. This group is devoted to the specific discussion of Pure O ocd, ocd where the compulsions are primarily mental.

Its obviously making your life a living hell, having to be putting up with this guy. Dump him and find a bloke who can actually treat you good and give you respect. If he has angeer management problems, it can get worst in the future which can cause violence etc. You dont want to be in an unhappy relationship, find another guy who can make you happy, not like him!<br>  x|`|qkknzSlDaa	Tell him its over...i mean honestly i was in the same kind of relationship. You have to move on because he is hurting you. Thats what i think and it sounds like your tired of hurting.|`|t35sHVYCaa	The 14 year old actually makes a little sense there. <br>  (a) The dude obviously isn't into you anymore or <br>  (b)he probably forgot how to treat a woman<br>  (c) he's gotten too comfortable and thinks you're an easy push over.<br>  Let him know that ur not happy with the way things are going and the way he is treating you and let him know that if he doesn't change you are going to leave him. If he does not try to make any effort then leave him. There are lots of single guys out there who will treat you better. Even if you love him to the death I don't think that his attitude is good for your well being right now. Sometimes you have to see about your happiness.
QqY8YgGDaa	Sometimes|`|Vf2ai0ljaa	If he doesn't like you then you must have something on your face...or he can see up your skirt :P<br>  <br>  But anyhow, you should go and talk to him...maybe start a short little conversation.
BaNrweQ4aa	:o we have the same name! :P<br>  Tanya D <br>  <br>  to be an extremely kind person means you care about people; and their feelings and basically means loving, nice, generous and sympathetic aswell. all these words have a similar meaning and it's difficult to find the exact meaning. to be extremely kind is a good thing - and a good quality to have! means you have a really good personality; and you can be kind-natured to people's feelings and problems :)|`|DeUvhuuQaa	i would count kind as generous. and maybe friendly.|`|gpoi6GKtaa	yes it does pretty much mean the same thing but being extremely kind also goes by another description-----<br>  <br>  Door mat-  sorry but i  learned that the hard way!
T3b4I4kXaa	Stay out of it... your sister made her bed and will have to sleep in it. Her BF will find out whether she is a brat.<br>  <br>  Your parents have apparently been AWOL for most of your sister's upbringing. They didn't take time out to teach her all she will need to make her way in the world... things like personal responsibility, respect, ethics and the like. They had the imperative to teach her these things by ANY means necessary, including the slap across the face or a belt across the fanny. <br>  At 19, your parents don't have to put up with your sister's impertinence any longer. She is an adult and needs to get out there and support herself.<br>  <br>  Your goal is to keep it real... stay out of rebellion and do the BASICS that keep you off your parents' radar. Make good grades, clean up after yourself, do your chores, and show your parents basic respect.|`|XGrNQGEoaa	No this is not abuse your sister is out of control and need a reality check. I am not saying that it is or was ok for your dad to hit your sister but a slap in the face wont kill her. because they are the parents  they get to decide the discipline. but it have to be a lot worse than a d** slap.as for you just support and mind your own business don't let their problem become yours|`|tPMNAFbsaa	Where I am from (the Caribbean) she would get almost killed for telling her dad to go F**K himself. A slap would be very minor. Even here in the US Caribbean parents still beat the crap out of their kids if they are being disrespectful. And no, that's not abuse.|`|T72COWC8aa	No, I am looking forward to kicking the crap out of my kids when they get smart with me.|`|BbWk7RNgaa	It's certainly not child abuse.  There is no such thing as a 19 year old child.  She's an adult.  I'm not sure whether or not a slap in the face can be considered assault.<br>  <br>  Therapy only works if everyone is willing to change, to compromise.  You can help by not taking sides, but being there to comfort whoever needs it.  If you are the younger sibling, your parents have a responsibility to make sure you're okay, that you're not too stressed out by all of this.  If they go to therapy, it might be a good idea for you to go, too.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you.  Remember that yr sibling is going through a period where she wants independence but probably can't afford it yet, and that is stressful for her.  This too shall pass!|`|1af1c7a379dffa78d14850f6eb8af852aa	SHE GOT OFF MILD, discipline should be administered without anger, but in that instance she got of mild with just a slap......I don't consider that abuse......|`|IWzYB44raa	She deserved that slap.  It is not abuse at all.  Sounds more like she is abusing him verbally.|`|9IaglFQhaa	I believe this would be assault|`|yDVlTUYTaa	Legally speaking, slapping anyone- husband to wife, parent to child,- is considered physical abuse. It's not enough to get Dad any jail time but it could send him to anger management if your sis presses the issue.<br>  Of course her yelling obscenities at him would technically be categorized as verbal abuse so, yea, therapy is a good idea for both of them and I hope they start right away for the whole families sake.

EmUMa0f8aa	First my heart & prayers goes out to BELL'AM and her 18 year young daughter. I would pray for her then call the POLICE and turn the guy in for selling drugs (pot). I had to turn my 34 year old brother-in law in for having sex with my 16 year young step-daughter and my wife and her family got mad at me and that why I am divorced today (her choice) but I had to protect my step-daughter, I had prayed hard about this before & after I did it. Now to answer your question, parents are entitled to their opinions and should inform their son(s)/daughter(s) and then let their child(ren) make their own choice on whom they will marry UNLESS *their child has mental issues/mentally challenged,* if the parents are going to have to support both their child and the person they are going to marry,' there is a great risk of injury/death to their child if they marry this person, *and any other situtation that would warrant the parent's interference.|`|0tusTThyaa	I think YES and NO. There is something to be said for "arranged marriages." I would say that more often than not, those marriages last a long time. And I am not including child brides or multi-wives in the arranged marriage either. <br>  <br>  Our parents have a vast knowledge of life, far more than us children do, especially when it comes to life and love. I would say that the typical adult is married between 25-28 years old now. Still young. We, as children, should ask our parent opinions about the person we are dating, especially if it seems to be moving in that area. Probably even way before that time approaches.<br>  <br>  When you are dating someone, you are biased to that person. You cannot usually form a clear level-headed opinion about him/her because you are IN love. While your friends or parents can see things you refuse to see. There is also something to be said when your parents and your friends do not like the person you are dating. If it's one friend, that can be excused. But if no one likes him/her, there is usually a good reason for that.|`|50c48696b7488dc525798f3a4b51347daa	Having been both a parent and a child and also having heard both sides of the story here is my opinion.  In almost all cases, parents should not have a say in who their children marry.  The exception is when the parents are afraid for their child's well being.  I am thinking of cases where there is domestic violence.  Even in these cases often times the best that the parents can do is to state their opinion and then make sure the door is open when the child gets beat up and needs a place to stay safe.  This is of course assuming that the child is over 18.|`|lqtA2qhAaa	I think a lot of problems I have seen with my friends and family in this area is when the fiance or fiancee is or has been disrespectful to the others family.  It is completely disrespectful to the family and to you if your fiance is disrespectful to your family.  It shows their true colors I believe, and shows how they will treat you ultimately.|`|o3LYq4oQaa	no because its not there hearts thats in love they already have love its you getting married sono they really shouldnt but if you want to its your perogive|`|XGp3oF5baa	absoultly not! you're parents may know what is best for you but they don't know who your heart really loves.|`|Q9HsDMAgaa	I think the child should at least listen and consider what the parent has to say|`|kbz5S3waaa	i can't look at it from a parents as i have no children, but i don't think they should have a say, as my in-laws are psychotic dirt bags who don't want anything good for their children (they're long time abusers...)|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Depends on the age of the child and then it would be more of a matter of advice rather than a "say". Don't wait until your children are about to marry to start trying to raise them. If you do it right they will do it right. Love is blind remember?|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Well, first off that's the problem right there...when children get married.  I wouldn't recommend getting married before 30 these days, and then of course someone's parents would have no say.  The person is more than adult at that age and secure in their careers and yet young enough for children and the divorce rate would probably be lower if people waited thru their 20's.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Nope. Parents will either complicate or totally ruin the situation. Culture smultre. I do think people need to LISTEN to their parents advice and counsel, but they need ot make their own decisions when they're adults.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Nope. Parents need to cut that umbilical cord. I didn't even tell my parents when I got married, I was too worried that they would try to get too involved.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	Once the kid is 18, no.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Parenting is giving your child a set of values growing up.  After they are grown, all you can do is hope they stick to those values. This means you can't choose anything for them anymore.....clothes, job, education, relationships. You just have to trust your child!  I hope my daughter is wise enough to choose well, but I will not be involved in that process. I want her to be happy for the rest of her life, as does any parent. I am raising her to be an independent, clear thinking adult; after I have finished, she is on her own.  I'm also quite sure she won't want my opinion on her love life after high school.....|`|uF5Xgtgraa	If you are out of your parent's house, independent and living on your own, your parents should have no say.  I think if you are in love, it would be foolish to ask your parents "Gee, mommy and daddy, should I marry them?"<br>  <br>  Note: I don't have kids, so I cannot see it from the parent's view....|`|0KLu4hRaaa	If their child is of age then NO the parent should not have a say in who they marry. Adults do not need other people's okay to marry someone, and any parent who tries to be that lousy should be put in an insane asylum.|`|lckv4hs3aa	I don't think so. We'll i'm all for hearing parents opinions, but whether i act on it or not is my own decision and should be left up to me.|`|jBigEy0Caa	They have a right to an opinion, but ultimately it is the person getting married decision.|`|BVQcBbmIaa	No parents should not.<br>  Grown up Kids can do what the hell they want. Do your parents let their parents tell them what to do?|`|KEUFaCkUaa	well if the kid is 14 then i'd say yes.|`|AA11693263	I wish it worked that way. My 18 year old daughter is planning on getting married this summer and it is killing me that I can't do anything to stop it. She is going to wake up one day and realize she married a complete jerk. He treats her badly, her rough houses with her so harshly that he has sprained her back, twice. And I just have to sit back and watch it all happen. The only reason he has money to halfway support her is from the pot that he sells. If we say anything to her, he turns everything around to make it look like it's just us trying to break them up for no reason. He didn't feel like taking her to her cousins baby shower yesterday and when her dad showed up to take he to it, she started yelling at him. He bf said he couldn't take her because his road was flooded and my husband went over to prove that it wasn't. Instead of grabbing her things and getting in the car with my husband so she could come to the shower and see her sisters and cousins she got mad that my husband went to go get her and said that the road wasn't flooded. Then that turned into her yelling at me (I still don't know why) about not talking to her about her wedding. I told her that she needed to think about why I won't talk to her about it. I told her I would not talk to her about it until she stops acting like a programed robot and started acting like herself again. It's just a huge mess and if there was anything I could do to get her away from this guy I would. And it's not a matter of me just not wanting to let her go. She has a couple of wonderful, hardworking, sweet, kind, gorgeous guys that are completely in love with her and would do anything for her. She just has to be with the guy that I don't like to prove to me that she is going to make her own decisions. I could take her living with him like she is, I thought that after a while, if I supported her decision and took the fight out of it for her, she would lose interest and see that he is totally wrong for her, that he is only bringing her down. She has already given up so many of her dreams for him. But now this ridiculous wedding as soon as possible thing has come up. And no, she's not pregnant. That's one of the reason's why I can't understand why they can't wait for a few years. But because I am against it, it is just fueling her fire to get married as soon as possible. I just don't know what to do anymore about her. I guess just be here for her to pick up the pieces. I hope that her grows up and it doesn't come to that, I really do. But being as headstrong as she is, she will go through with it, she will finally see his true colors and then she'll come back home and finally be able to fulfill her dreams.
f5FmJRfIaa	You turn him on, enjoy it :)<br>  Wet dreams are more common during puberty, but yes older guys can have them too.  That must have been one specail evening!|`|WQlCxeFlaa	Hahaha way to go!! It happens to guys all the time, weather their 16 or 60...well, I ddon'tknow about 6t0 but it hha pens. Be flattered, it means your the girl of his dreams  ^_~|`|JZOTL370aa	Well I am not a man, however I have 6 brothers some older and some younger, and according to them, yep it happens to them when they're past puberty too.  So take it as a compliment and have him tell you every detail and use it as a tool to recreate his dream and make it a reality. I am sure if was good enough to get him there in a dream, it would be even more intense in reality....<br>    ENJOY
fAN8snFdaa	it is very normal and probably did happen.. <br>  he obviously likes you ALOT !!!!|`|63GLryA3aa	hey there,sexually, most guys reach there peak at 19 yearsof age,give or take a month or two.if your guy is still having wet dreams about you,just shut up and enjoy it.in a short time he will be buying pills off the net just to get hard.|`|hqtOKXThaa	I believe it is due to involuntary/ sub-conscious masturbating. It is common but only if you are in a very emotional state for a guy. You are lucky!|`|p9QndBScaa	Yes this can happen to any man at any age. It is normal and I would feel flattered,a little anyway.|`|e5a37e7afe8ec6690c5df08cdf7e5e71aa	this is normal. One of my boyfriends said he got a ***** thinking about me after the first time we did it.

Be happy it was about you=))|`|vLFhGJuXaa	he is ok|`|DCXi0iy6aa	to be honest, it happened to me sometimes too, when I thought of my lady, but mostly not without putting my hands on ... and when you are as pretty as your pic looks like then I can fully understand your friend and by the way ... this has nothing to do with puberty as I am 44+|`|YkKQoRfcaa	sucks doesnt it|`|ywoph0FVaa	everyone does that....it's normal...don't be freaked out|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	It is something that occurs naturally during puberty. I suppose that if he was having an extremely sexually charged dream that it could trigger a climax but I wouldn't characterize that as typical of adult men.|`|AA11755944	it is not unheard of for a man to have nocturnal discharge.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	It has never happened to me, but whether he's lying or not doesn't matter, you should be flattered because its a compliment.|`|mJDqKejtaa	thats soooo normal that meas he cares about u and guys NEVER grow up|`|6b0183be8b59d389afaeae26f5356580aa	It happens.|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	uh i think it is normal.....
kGBli717aa	You can't live your life worrying about your parent's blessing or lack there of. Once you marry, that will be your family and any children you may have. Trust me about your parents, they will come around sooner or later. Your point about how they will have to be supportive if they want to see their future grandchild is spot on. That as well as you being their only child will make them see reason. Do not postpone your wedding; this is your life, live it!|`|yiBSvLf8aa	Your question brings to mind a couple of passages from a little book <br>  I have entitled "Apples Of Gold" ... quotes on love, peace, faith, etc ...<br>  <br>  One of the mysteries of life is how the boy who wasn't good enough <br>  to marry the daughter can be the father of the smartest grandchild in the world!<br>  <br>  Add all the love of all the parents and the total sum <br>  cannot be multiplied enough times to express God's love for me, <br>  the least of his children.<br>  <br>  To handle yourself, use your head;<br>  To handle others, use your heart.<br>  <br>  I hope you find a way to have peace in your life.<br>  <br>  From Abraham Lincoln:<br>  "I do the very best I know how -- the very best I can, <br>  and I mean to keep on doing so until the end."
29hcn9JRaa	Trust isn't a right, trust is a privilege that is earned by a persons actions. A persons actions versus their words play a huge role in learning to trust. What your girlfriend or wife has to say verbally can't always be taken as proof that she can be trusted, however her actions what she either has done in the past or today, can make the difference between trust or no trust. For example, when your a little kid and your sick with the flu, one of your parents may bring you a cup of soup and a aspirin, this is a action of love and trust. Basically my point is if you need to learn how to trust someone, all you need to do is to look at the persons past or present actions, it is not what they say, it is what they do or have done that determines if they are trust worthy, or not?|`|fHfVRcqbaa	As you get to know each other and become closer, you should become more confident in their love for you and their willingness and ability to be trustworthy.  If they do something to break your trust, it is much much harder to trust them again, and they have to actually make a conscious effort to do things to inspire your trust.  <br>  <br>  If you have been together for a significant amount of time, and they have never done anything to break trust, then you should be able to trust them.  If you don't, then you need to figure out what is wrong with you and what issues you have that are imparing your ability to put your trust in the person you love.  It may even include talking to someone or checking out some self help books.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Well, I'm always saying that trust is not something you just get, it's something you earn with time. You have to be honest, open, etc and with time your partner will start to build up trust in you.|`|Cpwedckvaa	Just trust until they give you a reason not to...Make sure that you ask for the things that YOU need in order to feel secure and if they can give them to you....great...if they can't then you need to deal with that.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	you can't learn you just do or don't
JzTg0hg5aa	well even if you think that sex is gross everyone gets sexually aroused by someone/something. its normal to think it's nasty but then want it at the same time. <br>  <br>  well, the thing about you liking older men i think is just kind of disturbing. i think you should go out with your friends and try and meet some new guys(your age)and you might find a good one.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck [:|`|rZGJJ26vaa	possibly you are too young and you have not matured into your Sexual nature and that was a dream paving the way so to Speak - especially of you felt older in the dream. maybe you do not have a sex drive yet - and this is why it seems gross but in a few years you might and this is was the dream was about - don't rush or push yourself. <br>  <br>  and many people like older men - however when i was your age i like the older movie stars but i don't fo for older men - there was just no one at school i was interested in.|`|rBfyVHPvaa	i think you are one messed up kid.|`|07L1TwNraa	the movie probably got your brain thinking, yeah. But...if you've never had sex before how can you think it is gross? Believe me, its amazing. <br>  And that's pretty common,  I know a lot of girls that are attracted to older men. <br>  <br>  So basically, you probably subconsciously want to have sex even though you think it would be gross.|`|hV6knOWdaa	trust me, you might not think you'd enjoy sex but once you have it you'll love it. most girls I know want sex more than guys and like it much more.|`|ysexlf9baa	probably or your just curious at to what would happen. still nothing to worry about but if u shared dat wid da world den uv obs bn thinkin bout it all day so maybe u are just very curious and still nothin to be worryd bout|`|ls3TD7Teaa	well there is no shame in dreams they are not real, but if you are really intrested in thoes kinds of things keep them to yourself until you actually find someone that you love. i make love with my older boyfriend and it is amazing so you are not alone with that dream. i hope that i helped you:) good luck:)|`|VayviaQvaa	you should text me so we can have a   valid decision.
X6ADjE1laa	If you love her, you should pay for education and end her pole dancing career. go save her :)|`|hIwJxNVkaa	tell her youll pay for her education man.. or something.. just get her back dude... do whatever it takes..|`|QYahxUEWaa	Don't you want to get to know me???<br>  <br>  <br>  Honey, what is meant to be is going to happen no matter what. Don't rush or push her I do suggest you to look for her 1 more time but this time don't have sex. <br>  <br>  You are going to say DON'T HAVE SEX. you are crazy but not really if you show her you are trying to get to know her more than a physical chemistry she might say yes and get to know you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't show her either that you are head over heels for you cause she might just used you.<br>  <br>  Be careful|`|cfFlf1EAaa	Okay Mr.T-pain falling in love with strippers. I would say just let it go. It wouldnt be good 2 date a stripper she might cheat on you. Imagine how many other guys she slept with the way she did you. If you tell her 2 be with you cuz you have a lot of money she will use you 4 it. Yall relationship wouldn't be real. So 2 keep from being hurt even more let her be. You can find someone better. I'm 23yrs.old just like you I also went through a lot. I just never fell in love with a stripper. But I know that it wouldn't work between u 2 unless thats what she really want.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	um i hope u broke up with ur gf before doing all this..

Q56ymRniaa	Well, when you get free time in class politely sit by her and make a joke up or say something to make her laugh (girls love funny guys) after that just carry on a conversation with her. Think of what to say in advance so you don't wind up having an akward pause. Just be like "hey what's up" or "so that test was soo hard" or evan talk bad/good about the teacher. I hope this helps <br>  :]<br>  Good luck
AwAw0uiKaa	My husband was married once before I ever knew him, and she told him she would love him even if he were to be wheelchair bound. Well, He got in a car accident in 2000 and broke is neck, and is now a quadriplegic (paralyzed from the chest down and cannot use his hands). While he was recovering in the hospital she cheated on him... with his father... divorced him, and took his two children with her.<br>  <br>  I met him afterwards, married him, and I love him completely.<br>  <br>  So, my point is, while some people cannot handle drastic things happening to their lovers, I personally am able to see past physical things. :)|`|KasFZL7laa	i could.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	If I could handle them on the inside than the outside wouldn't matter to me. I would absolutely miss the little physical traits I love so much, but in the end that wouldn't change my love for him.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I took my vows seriously when we got married.  I would stand by him no matter what.  I married him because he is my best friend, I couldn't leave for a small reason like any that you mentioned.|`|fcQQDonWaa	yea for sure. i love my wife. i know whe would to the same for me. so i wouldn't look at that. but i would always remember who she is from in the inside!|`|lNqSx1znaa	Of course you still love them--but life changes.|`|5s40kkxtaa	yes. every human being with a little brain sees how terrible life is, so full of suffering, how do you keep yourself shallow when you have eyes to see. and you have eyes to see you see how genuine, caring, beautiful person inside radiates outside no matter what. I knew a man that tortured and humiliated a woman just because he coldnt understand that a female can be so egoless. Well at least, little ego - less. Tormented and humiliated her for falling in love with an old man. Like some kind of pervert. Like she did it on purpose. Like she enjoyed the situation.|`|fYwejlHOaa	Its really difficult. Its human nature to be attracted to someones looks rather than what they are inside but some people can push looks to the side and continue their love.<br>  <br>  For me I am more attracted to looks, obviously the inside matters but I dont really think I could handle them. Depends really.|`|aCPZpUoNaa	yes!i love my husband for the person he is..of course looks did matter at first but wen u say u 'love' someone his or her looks doesn't matter much,u den begin to see the inside of him/her..the real them..so ya if anything happens to him i would stil love him the same..but ther would defn be difficulties..role change,ability to show affection,u may feel rejected..n so on..|`|KcVXWa9Yaa	it would be very hard for me i would love the person but i dont know if i would stay with them|`|iDGtmPiQaa	i couldd.. i would help them through itt andd love them for who they are andd nott wat they look lke|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	yes, you don't just stop loving someone because of some accident
GBr9YngTaa	Why do you categorize ALL girls together?|`|4PK0hiWeaa	shouldn't be together anyways, the temptation to go wild in college is too much|`|kWjy7uzAaa	This is what my old man told me about women. The first rule is do on to her before she does on to you, make sure you cheat on her first with a bunch of her friends, so that when the inevitable day comes that she does cheat on you, you can show her a porno staring you and her friend. That way your reputation won't be ruined by dating an unfaithful whore.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Sounds like you know some worthless girls.  I didn't start college with a bf, but my roomie did and she was faithful to him the entire time.  And she was gorgeous, so it wasn't for lack of opportunity.  They are married now.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Cheating makes us sluts and you a hero.  Whatever. I didn't cheat on my HS boyfriend when I went to college.  Don't date liars.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	I don't think that all girls are the same.  However, if they think their BF is off at  college banging other girls they'll do the same.  It's a defense mechanism.|`|mJDqKejtaa	i have had bfs on the other side of the us and i never cheated on them it ALL about trust. so DONT categories us!!!!!!!!!!|`|IE46NZrYaa	That's a completely ridiculous statement to make...not every single girl cheats on her boyfriend the minute his back is turned. you probably just had it happen to you once and now you're all bitter and twisted about it.  most girls wouldn't do it if they really loved their boyfriends. your girl was probably just a slut.|`|ywoph0FVaa	Hmmmm....mad much?? Have you ever thought about the guys that constantly cheat on girls? PLUS, college should be a time to be able to do whatever you want. True, breakup before you go to college, but don't get mad that she's living her life and doing some new things that she wants. Move on....break up with her first. She apparantly doesn't like you anymore so move on.|`|6JrCDCtuaa	lol it doesn't quite make you a slut, it just makes you unfaithful.<br>  <br>  and college is a new experience, you meet a whole bunch of new people. people cheat if their relationship isn't strong and it's clearly not what you thought it was before college. that's why it's smarter going to college single :)|`|oB1WQJHgaa	did this happen to you and your mad? I would never do this!! my bf is 2 yrs younger and i will go to college soon and if i want someone else i would break up with the old one. plz dont categorize all girls... :) thx|`|knXnjnSmaa	This seems more like statements than a question. Girls will do what they do and that's life.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	CAUSE THEY SAY GUYS DO THAT TOO.. THEY WANA HAVE FUN TOO|`|1DX1KvGkaa	Not all girls are like this...
zCE0slQ5aa	There is no such thing as normal. There is only you and than there is the rest of the world. Your first step in conquering your Anti-social character is to afford everyone the individualism that they deserve.<br>  <br>  women like "commonality". they like it spiritually, emotionally, and physically. you know that there are women in the world, in this country, and in your hometown who are as equally "challenged" or more so than you are. seek them out.<br>  <br>  the same holds true for friends and social situations. find people that share your interests and lifestyle. surround yourself with people you share "commonality" with. you will fit in and a whole new world will be opened to you both socially and professionally.<br>  <br>  now for the impotence,...have you consulted a physician regarding this? have you consulted alternative medicine? look into these two sources if you haven't. if all else fails and you have exhausted every effort...there is always the "Professional" route. At least you can explore the possibility of physical stimulation.<br>  <br>  as for the marriage and family...that is going to become a viable consideration once you tackle and conquer the anti-socialism issues. if you can't conceive children there is adoption but you and/or your spouse must be able to provide.<br>  <br>  the real question here is what do you desire and what are you willing to do to achieve it?

You said your youngest is 22 months then you could definetly be struggling with something that can easily fixed with some medication!!!|`|4kjIsqpnaa	Sounds like you just have a lot to deal with, raising three children is a lot of hard work. Hence why you are tired and worried. <br>  <br>  If people have let you down that is their problem. Sometimes people only care about themselves, its just who they are. Nothing to do with you and how much you cared for them.<br>   <br>  Perhaps try to link up with old mates or family you have not seen or chatted to for a bit? When we are down we dont actually see what we have around us? Send a few texts out or even make a few phone calls once the kids are asleep to break up the week. Or even invite people over if they are free? People love to be around children :-)<br>  <br>  Anyone with your responsibilities would feel stressed out, its only natural. Sounds like you need some time to do stuff for you.<br>  <br>  As for your husband, tell him how you feel, that you need a break sometimes and that he can take care of the kids for a couple of hours while you go and do things that make you happy for a bit?<br>  <br>  Hope these ideas helped you in some way :-)|`|XzWLcQmqaa	you're probably wundering if you are suffering from depression.<br>  set that aside.<br>  i think you are in a rut and need some kind of hobby,outing, not so much friends but aquantences.<br>  go to a gym. work out your frustrations and be healthy at the same time. you can meet people there and set some goals together.<br>  you don't have to be friends with them but you can have someone to communicate with in a real conversationas long as personal life is out of it.<br>  as far as your husband he should be spending time with the kids not leaving at will and come back at will.<br>  he has his sports you should have a time off too.<br>  as far as "friends" i know the feeling. all my life i have had the same 2 and no more.|`|uvpwaT9taa	It sounds like your suffering from depression.

NeTNnvSZaa	One of three things needs to happen:  You need to change the way you feel about porn (you need to understand that he's not likely to change the way he feels about porn and he won't stop, he'll just be more covert about his activities) you both need to get counselling and learn to respect each other's limits and desires or you need to split up.  Talk to him about your options.|`|iVeUJydbaa	sounds to me like you gotta talk to him about this, you have your right to not do what he wants you to do. Sounds like hes a little addicted to what hes watching on the net but if i were you id talk to him about it|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Porn is a substitute for deep intimacy.  Do you talk about your own deep thoughts and feelings with him, or do you hide those and have surface conversations?  <br>  <br>  You should try revealing more of yourself to your husband; tell him how you feel and what you think... about him, about life, about anything.<br>  <br>  And frankly, after you get intimate with him in conversation, you might want to take him from behind anyway.  It's more fun to have interesting sex with someone you really know.|`|SbZG9iPfaa	dont listen to the first person. if it makes you feel uncomfortable then dont do it. that doesnt make you a ***** but i do think that you should let your husband at least watch it if you wont do anything. try something else. and i dont really understand how him watching porn effects you besides the fact he wants you to do these things.|`|TGRKbQMVaa	Don't do with your body anything you don't like.|`|JXmvNMRwaa	TELL HIM TO GO AND FIND A FREAK TO SPEND HIS LIFE WITH.|`|3fwJBhJdaa	If you don't do those disgusting vulgar  things.

We agreed to let them stay and help what we could. We never asked for anything from them except to keep my home clean and pick their own things up. It was rough at times but hey you never know when you are going to be the one needs help. But 9 times out of 10 they wouldn't help you after you have helped them.|`|AA10873763	I would explain to my spouse how strongly I feel about helping a friend.  If my spouse is so rigid and unfeeling that he would still disagree, then I would have to rethink my commitment to someone with such starkly different values.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	we have a great free place for people to stay in my community<br>  <br>  or there's the igloo out back they could stay in<br>  <br>  seriously, my wife would never do that.|`|CxRJwJsraa	If my husband said no, and really put his foot down not a "I'd rather not" where he might be persuaded, then the answer would be no.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Sad to say,tell them no.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	A house is a place of comfort & relaxation and I would never force my wife to share living space with someone she didn't want there.  My loyalty is to my wife first / friends second.<br>  <br>  Of course outside of relatives & short visitations I personally find "guests" an intrusion into my home & marital life (and intimacy).  That's not to mention that house guests tend to OVERSTAY their welcome, they don't pull their own weight (cleaning / paying utility costs / food costs and they are just in the damn way).<br>  <br>  Of course I'm  a guy and I would never ask my wife if a female "friend" could be a house guest (because she would feel threatened) and I would never invite a "guy" friend to live with me either (sorry dude..friend or not you will not be in a house with my wife).|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I would let them stay. My husband would understand|`|YHcyuka3aa	Your home is a joined property in which the both of you live thus you both have rights. When some one is down on their luck is always nice to help, but your husband probably knows where this will lead. Once this person is in your home, it is very difficult to get them out. If its going to cause trouble between you and your husband, then think of another way.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	I would look up a therapist who could help me break my shift-8 problem.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I honestly think that if it were important to me, my wife loves me enough and trusts my judgment enough that she would be OK with it.  And the reverse is true as well.  I love and trust my wife enough that, if she has a serious objection to something, she probably has a very good reason.  I suppose that's just how marriages of mutual respect work.|`|z1C75GIaaa	If my friend one day needed a place to stay, he would allow her to stay with us for a short period of time. It all depends on what the situation is though. <br>  <br>  However, if your friend already knows your husband and know how he is going to react, then she would not ask to stay with you.|`|jBigEy0Caa	No.  They'll find somewhere to lay their head & it may help them get motivated to get a job.|`|cobGkGC7aa	tell them no|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	let them in because you are not cruel|`|fc4NOCp3aa	I would speak to my spouse about the REASONS he doesn't want a house guest.  Let's face it - most people don't like other people staying in their home for anything longer than say...1 week.  As human beings, we have a need for our own personal freedom and space and having someone around all the time makes you feel like you have to be on your best behavior.  You aren't free to just walk through the kitchen & fart! :) So, ask the spouse why specifically he or she is so opposed to it.  If it's because this person tends to get you in trouble, then I can understand that.  If this person doesn't like your spouse & has been very verbal about that, then I don't blame the spouse!  Getting to the root of why will help you understand.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't put my friendship ahead of my marriage ever - period.  There's no friend in the world worth more to me than my husband or his happiness.  Now if his reasons were completely frivolous & silly then we'd have to talk.  But in the end, this will affect you both so it's only fair to include him in the decision making.|`|YWRNL5sKaa	Sex.|`|JWNzoksmaa	i would first ask the husband/wife why they didn't want house guest.  Listen to them fully w/o arguement or opinions.  Then state you have a friend that is in dire need of a place to stay for a short period of time.  I would also state that you understood and respected the husband/wifes request not to house guest, but you would have to overrule, this one time, their request b/c your friend needed a place to stay.  <br>  <br>  Approach this situation, calmly but firmly...do not argue..just state how it's going to be with no emotion what so ever. Just do it matter-of-factly.  if the spouse puts up an arguement or fight...hear them out..let them vent, but i would stand by my guns and have the friend move in anyway.  <br>  <br>  It's your home also, and you should have a say.  And there will be times your marriage that you'll both disagree and will have to compromise...this is one of those times that your spouse will have to compromise with you.  Period. <br>  <br>  After you have ran this buy your spouse.  The next course of action is to go to your friend and explain the situation.  Explain how your spouse isn't really happy about having a house guest and for your friend to be on his/her best behavior.  That's, helping around the house, clean up their mess, and contribute as much monetary items as possible.  Even if it's buying your own groceries.  If money is an issue for your friend...then they should help a lot around the house.  Either cooking dinner, cleaning up after dinner, taking out the garbage, helping with the kids (if you have any) etc etc etc.  This should be made clear to your friend...it's not a free ride.  You must make an effort somehow, someway...so it doesn't drive a wedge between the you and your spouse.  If your friends agrees and then becomes the house guest from hell....welll then i believe it would be time to cut ties with that friend b/c that friend doesn't respect you, your home and your family.  you opened your doors to a friend in need....a friend would repay you someway. <br>  <br>  Get what i'm saying.<br>  <br>  One more thing....above all else...you always side with your spouse when the friend moves in.  If you spouse have complaints about the friend listen calmly and attentively (remember your spouse compromised) and YOU address the friend of these complaints....and make sure you make it clear to the friend you side with your spouse.  This is important.  You must stand as a unit...else you will drive a huge wedge between you and your spouse.  You love your friend, but you LOVE your spouse.  You two are partners.  Friends will come and go....above all else this "our" home.  O.K....if you adhere to this advice it will go smoothly. <br>  <br>  And vice versa with your.  If your friend has any complaints about your spouse..hear him/her out.  But make sure when you go to the your spouse its not in an accusing manner.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	I think overall you have to respect your spouses feelings on the subject.  How long is this person going to be staying and is it a male or female houseguest?  No way my wife would be bringing another man into my house.  These are things that should be discussed and then a decision made.|`|AA11506593	Since you are an equal partner in your marriage, you must both agree about house guests. If one says no, then the answer is no.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to pick your friend over your spouse, I suggest you get a divorce and rent an apartment with your friend. I'm sure you will both be very happy together.|`|NmsuIXd1aa	i would help them for a limited time only, about 1 week. you have to live with your husband/wife. they always get to walk out the door. besides where are there parents/friends you can't be the only one.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	You would tell them no.  The spouse is your life partner and the friend can come and go.  Where is the love and respect if you allow the friend to stay against your spouses wishes.|`|ygAkXSknaa	It would have to depend on the situation, how long, why that person chooses to ask you for that kind of help, and why is your wife against it? Does she have any valid reasons? She may.|`|eus7WqzUaa	I would let my friend stay and tell my wife/husband to kiss it.  The only time I wouldn't let my boyfriends friend stay is if he had really bad habits.  My boyfriend is a follower, not a leader.|`|9ZZzEvBFaa	I guess it kinda depends on how long the person needs a place to stay, just for the night? then sure but for an extended stay, you should probably go with your partner|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Love is a battlefield...<br>  <br>  I'd come out and tell her that a friend was spending some time with us. <br>  Granted, if the friend has turned into a raving crackhead, they would not stay long...|`|68b44e1447cd07a05f63d57f1733c707aa	Need more info.  Who is this person in relation to you.  Is this person trust worthy|`|NohEhCrDaa	only for a week tops,<br>  longer than that, it will become a burden|`|u7KqSCs2aa	You have to go with your conscience.  If your spouse really doesn't want a house guest, and you betray the trust that they put in you by choosing the guest instead, you are likely to be headed toward divorce court.  If you can ask other friend's or family members where the house guest should look for a place to live then maybe they can help.<br>  Maybe your spouse would agree to let them live for a very short time, and only if they are really getting into the job search and getting signed up for food stamps and public aid assistance.  Why are they needing a place to stay?  If it's because they just lost their job and have their unemployment run out,  that's one thing.  But if they are homeless due to being unwilling to work and just wanting a party life style, that is strictly their problem.  Suggest charities that might be able to help in your area like the salvation army or the red cross or catholic charities.|`|uGY1eopqaa	I guess it would definitely depend on the situation. If you've been friends for over ten years maybe you could talk to your partner and just let them know that this person is very important to you. Also tell them about their situation and how desperate they are for your help. Maybe you can come to an agreement on how long you should have a house guest, and set up some rules for everyone to avoid future arguments.<br>  <br>  But if they say no once, it all depends how much you're willing to argue about it with your partner. Sounds like a tough decision either way. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|nWKWoJAQaa	That's a tough one... but 1st you should have a talk with your husband/wife and find out exactly "why" they don't want house guests.  Talking it out would help them understand that your friend is in need and you don't want to leave them hanging.  Maybe your husband/wife has a very good reason or maybe if it's not.. talking it out would show him/her that you would like his approval as to not cause friction between the 2 of you.  I don't feel you should ever go against your spouse.  Agreement should be part of your relationship and respect for each others feelings.<br>  <br>  Talk it out.  Come to an agreement and compromise somehow.|`|hzH2YifUaa	I would listen to my spouse. That's your partner and ultimately you want to please them. Plus, it's their house too! Just explain the situation honestly to your friend. If they are a friend they will understand.

No other information is needed.  :)|`|hkwBR1moaa	Why do you have to put anyone but the bride and grooms name on it?  Save the parents for the regular invite.

kGBli717aa	If you are looking to marry this one, I don't recommend moving in with him without marrying first. Couples that live together without being married are much less likely to marry than those that don't. See link below for more on that. <br>  Also, don't do anything that you would not want your own future daughter to do. let's say she wants to live with her boyfriend and you disapprove, just picture her saying to you, "Well you did it, didn't you?". Something else to think about, anyway. <br>  Also, if you move in, you may save money but you may also loose your self respect.

igrdohopaa	I don't think she really means it.<br>  Leave it alone
AA11946390	Does she ever go get a drink of water from the fountain? Buy anything out of the vending machine? If you can catch her at a moment where she isn't active just tell her that you see her a lot and you would just like to introduce yourself. I would be receptive to that if it were me. Especially if I had been noticing you. Good luck.
BbWk7RNgaa	Wow, you just got your whole life turned upside down.  It's okay to be upset.  Take it easy.  Keep things as routine as possible.  Don't go out extra with friends, take a break from the group of friends that hurt you.  Meditate. Cry. Write or draw or dance, express yourself however you do.  Tell your parents how you feel, and try to help them, too.  I'm sure they're super stressed right now.<br>  <br>  If you do have to move, think of it as a chance to start over in a new place, somewhere fresh where you haven't been hurt, and you can make new, better friends.|`|IWzYB44raa	Maybe a move would be better than you think!  It would give you a chance to meet and make some new friends, much better than the crappy friends that you've got now.  I am sorry about your parents' jobs.  That is happening to a lot of people right now.|`|X2QUJsUaaa	Talk about ouch. Did your best friend know that you were in love with him? If so that's not much of a best friend. That aside, what can I say Paige, your life has gone down the drain. What can you do? Well answer this question Paige, what do you have left to loose.<br>  <br>  Moving will grant you new opportunities to meet new people and friends. If you stay in an environment that is the same you will never have a chance to grow as an individual. I know it's uncomfortable to move to a new town. I just moved over 2100 miles from the place I never wanted to move from.<br>  <br>  And you know I am loving it here and I never want to go back!<br>  <br>  The worse thing, since you already hit rock bottom, is that you'll hate it their.

You are aware, I'm sure, that there are a lot of people facing the same problem. We are in a financial crisis that is becoming global and shows no signs of slowing down. The best way you can help your parents right now is by reminding them that they are not alone in this and being as calm and flexible as you can. Families are going to have to pull together and begin making hard choices and standing by each other if they are going to survive the financial depression.<br>  <br>  And if you are really looking for girlfriends who will sleep around with all your boyfriends and crushes, I'm sure you can find such loyal and true buds in Chattanooga too if you search hard enough.|`|tPMNAFbsaa	It could be better if you move. Seems like nothing is going right where you are right now. No jobs, bad friends. Maybe you try a fresh start and leave all these atrocities behing you.

You young people have no idea how to talk! What the hell does "keep my name outta his mouth just because I want no drama" mean? What does bff mean? What is a hige argument? What does idk mean?

He feels that you are 2-faced so he won't be able to trust you anymore and once he can't even believe the words that are coming out of your mouth, it's over.
eS9MfSvmaa	I know exactly what you mean. When we had our Valentine's Dance, it was girls ask guys and I was really freaked out because I wanted to ask this guy reaallyy bad, but I was totally afraid of rejection. What I would do is strike up a conversation about the dance and give a few hints about not having a date. Play it cool and don't get nervous. Be casual about it, but make sure no one else enters the conversation because that could totally ruin your chance. If he makes a comment about not having a date either, suggest something like going dateless together, but like I said, play it cool. Don't look nervous and make sure to laugh if you say that, because if he thinks you're serious, there's a more likely chance he'll say no, or you getting embarrassed. At least if he thinks your joking, it won't ruin any friendships you had with him. If he says yes, then laugh and tell him you'll see him there. Maybe wink jokingly (make sure he knows your kidding) and walk away.<br>  <br>  Or, you know what? You could forget about the rest of the world and what they'll think of you, stand up, take a chance and a deep breath, cross your fingers, pray to God, and simply ASK HIM. If people laugh because you got rejected, tell them off, because they probably have no room to talk, considering the fact that they probably didn't even ask anyone. If anything, they should admire you for taking a risk, unlike most of them.|`|eHhrC4Biaa	DO IT! Who cares if he says no. You do. Well if he says no, then you know he doesn't like you.(Either that or he's a wimp and likes you back, but that's highly unlikely) well good cause now you know that you can be looking for a better guy. I've had my heart broken  times. That's all three times Ive had a boyfriend. It's not embarrassing. Just go up to him and ask him. Preferably alone. You don't want a crowd of people spreading rumors. And if HE starts spreading rumors, then you'll know he's a jerk and that you shouldn't have liked him in the first place.|`|XuNF6uv5aa	well ask him you wont lose anything<br>  but make it just between the two of you when you ask him out<br>  life's too short, if you like him, go for it =]<br>  best of luck x

And don't let her go back and forth. If you don't want to talk to her you could just wait it out and see what happens, if she keeps acting weird then she's just not interested. And at that point, you should just let it go. No point in going after somebody that doesn't have an interest in going after you. I know it sucks but be strong.|`|KNAaYprYaa	i think she wants you to do some more chasing. either that or she just doesn't like the speed of the relationship at the moment.<br>  <br>  maybe she's realized that she's being too forward and revealing all angles of her personality too soon and wants to remain a bit mysterious.<br>  <br>  OR she has realized that she doesn't want to take it as quickly as it's going.<br>  <br>  OR maybe she just isn't into you anymore.

He will not divorce his wife and he's just saying those things so you'll be sympathetic with him<br>  3. usually guys like that want an affair and they go to young/nieve girls .. those who are not v.attractive or those who have low confidence .. for them they are the best target<br>  4. your sister was totally wrong .. take the SIM card off .. never give your no. to a stranger .. either slap him or give him a false no. if you have to .. that would be fun hehe<br>  5. do not tell him it was your sis and anything else .. cut it completely .. you don't ow him any explainasions<br>  6. He will survive .. he is not in love .. love doesn't come in 1 week and to someone you hardly know .. he pretends he can't shut the phone when actually he would see the girl torn apart and won't care one bit after using her<br>  <br>  Be wise .. don't talk to guys on the phone like that .. it makes your relashionship with whoever you'll marry not honest/trusting at all .. Good luck<br>  hope every girl is wise like i am hehe .. jk :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: hehe no i didn't say you are ugly .. i meant it could be for one of those reasons<br>  how come people always ask me if i'm turkish .. even online (".) nope i'm not .. my grandad's mom was part turkish though<br>  yah be carefull .. better safe then sorry :)|`|dVfPBzAvaa	Tell your sisters to stop answering the phone when he calls.

L2t7Ek4paa	Not necessarily. I have heard girls who are active in sports sometimes break there hymens. I researched the topic for you and yes indeed such activities as bicycle riding, horseback riding, stretching, or dancing can cause the hymen to break.

I don't know why. My sister told me once it was because I am really funny. Okay. This man married me 4 yrs after we dated. Unfortunately, we didn't stay together. I will not say why.

ggujeOL5aa	I've been in your situation before. I think letting go of this friendship in my opinion is the right thing to do. It doesn't seem like it and why would you want to let go of a friendship you've had for so long? Well because he obviously doesn't value your friendship as much as you do if he's choosing his girlfriend over you. If they break up, once that happens he'll come right back and tell you that you were right and he was wrong. But do you have time to sit and wait until that happens while he keeps betraying you? I know he means a lot but i think you should do whats right for you. I know it won't be easy but it will just make you stronger. When a friend did this to me, it took me a while but i realized it was finally time to let go, it sucks when people change because of another person or change period. sometimes we can't adapt to their change and just move on. Good luck, do what you feel is right and what is good for the long run. keep your head up.|`|amKkfPS2aa	I wouldn't waste your time trying to convince him that he was in the wrong and make him understand you. He's changed and you can't switch it back no matter how much you want to try. People sometimes change because of their significant others and it really sucks. Maybe one day, they'll break up and he'll come running back to you, but for now the two worst things you can do are blaming anybody and getting your hopes up so high that you start to expect things from him that he can't provide at the moment. This is a special time in his life. Be there for him and wait for him to come around, because he will if he really is a friend, but don't let that be the only thing going on in your life; make new friends and spend more time with your other current ones. That way, you won't be lonely in the meantime or at all, and when - and if - your best bud returns you may have some new people for him to meet.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're going through this, and please remember to hang in there, it gets better! Good luck to you!! :)|`|RoyvUWl7aa	that really sux...but sometimes in life your "best friend" falls in love (or thinks he's in love) and they just change. it's all about the girlfriend..like their blinded or something.<br>  I would let it pass...don't contact him if he doesn't want you too...and i believe in time he'll realize how special your friendship really is. Be nice though, be pleasant, say hi, bye, whatever..but..i'd just leave him be..
f5FmJRfIaa	Wow, that's an enviable position to be in these days, to have a bird in hand, and one in the bush.  Well, you need to think on that, on the one hand you could use a nest egg, and on the other hand, your wife just had a baby 5 days ago, and there are going to be times when she will be concerned with wanting her husband around.  You both have a big adjustment to make with a new baby in the house, and she will need and want your help and support.  Maybe you should give it a few weeks and see how things go with the baby, and consider applying for a part time job for extra money, if your wife thinks being away at two full time jobs is too much, or take the other offer if it looks like a better way to go for your long term career goals. (That's a hard call to make though, if you have been at your current job long enough to have some "equity" built in it, who knows how long the other job will hold out?  If your company is downsizing, while the other company is hiring, that's something to think about too...)|`|paerqxfMaa	You're wife just had a baby five days ago and now you're looking to take on another full time jobs - tell me, when will you be seeing the wife and baby?  I'm sure she doesn't like the idea - you will be stressed, sleeping for the few hours you are home.  Maybe you need to really look at your spending, and see where you can cut back.  Maybe you can take a part-time position until you get on your feet.  Or maybe once your wife is up to it, you can stay with the baby at night and let her get a little part-time job - it will get her out of the house and bring some money in.  Look seriously at this - because it's isn't all about the money.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Fine to do it provided the hours do not mesh. You have to realize though it could kill you. Working alot of hours just add stress too in a marriage.|`|AwAw0uiKaa	As tough as the economy is right now, you shouldn't over-do it. Take whichever job pays better, and work only one. You don't want to take away time you can spend with your new baby girl, and you don't want to completely wear yourself out. Money is precious these days but its not worth your health or family development. And congratulations on your new baby!|`|0MunIx8raa	you will never be home to help your wife with the new baby, much less spend any time with the baby.  On the other hand you have to provide for your wife and baby, but you will have to choose which is more important to you.  you are lucky to have a job offer while you have another job.  There are no jobs to be had today.

Either you and your spouse sit down and decide together who gets what property -- or a judge will have to divide what is called your “marital" or your “community” property. If possible, of course, it’s best to do the dividing yourselves.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to do is to be open and honest in setting out everything of value you have come to own during your marriage. That includes revealing that you still have a little bank account you secreted away five years ago when the two of you were thinking about splitting up. Items such as these tend to surface sooner or later, and the penalties for hiding something of value can be serious.<br>  <br>  Dividing Up Property Yourselves<br>  If you and your spouse are going to try to divide your property yourselves, here are some steps to get you started.<br>  <br>  List your belongings. Working together, make a list of all of the items that you own jointly. Of course, you can omit items both of you agree are personal things of insignificant value.

I hope she stops.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Draw her cartoons and send to papers<br>  --You know that you can write E  mail messages to me  through this section by clicking the word e mail by opening  my  profile|`|Cv2h6n1Raa	Make up a list of everything that's wrong with her and next time she starts ripping on you just let it all out. She will probably be so stunned that you stood up to her, then she will be embarrassed that you called her out on all of her insecurities. Hopefully she will see how it feels like and stop bullying you. She sounds like a terrible person.|`|c2uywBsIaa	You should never let someone get to you so bad that you stop doing what you love.<br>  I would just ask her if she has a crush on you because she very observant to you and your clothing. Must mean that she is checking you out on a daily basis.<br>  haha<br>  I bet that would really embarrass her.|`|I0JBGllLaa	Ignore her.<br>  Or start being mean to her.<br>  Tell her she's ugly and she's promiscuous.<br>  <br>  I'm sure your hair is pretty.<br>  Wait, you are a little too young for internet, darlin'.|`|cYFblmpVaa	tell that it is not your fault that her parents do not love her and she needs to leave you alone<br>  then say "o by the way everyone hates you"<br>  then turn around and walk away|`|4xAOZXwNaa	Aw I know how you feel. Well the reason why she probably teases you is because she is jealous of you or she can be insecure on how she looks so she has to put others down to make herself feel better. The only thing you can do is try talking to her and ask her nicely if she can stop teasing and picking on you. And i know this may sound kinda lame but if she doesn't seem to stop after you tried talking to her then tell you're teacher or you're mom or someone. And I don't think you should leave that school because of her. don't let her get to you.! Don't let anyone bring you down. have a smile on you're face and don't worry about her.|`|987475b0db71996a7db0e2e10c1d960eaa	Don't quit 4-H just because of some little girl that's jealous of you! She thinks that by pointing out your "flaws" she'll make you feel small and helpless which gives her more power. Don't let it get to you! Whenever my "friends" make fun of me I tell them "Thanks! You're such a nice person!" It may make her think you're weird, but she'll leave you alone! 4-H is a great way to meet new people so stay away from her and talk to others! Don't worry about little miss snotty pants. Be the mature one and ignore her!|`|Yakgmg64aa	You shouldn't let girl have such an influence on you that you dont want to go anymore/ I say make some godo friends there that will stand up for you, and next time she picks on you, have your friends all gang up on her and beat her up. But remember the only reason shes saying those things to you is because she knows youll be upset about it, and some people just like seeing other peoples pain. I dont know if youl lbe able to get her off your back, but  isay you need to go back to 4-H and just ignore her :)|`|lnRMmSeyaa	whats 4-H?<br>  <br>  and sweetie dont try to get back at her because then your just lowering to her level, just ignore her and dont listen to anything she says she will soon get tired of being ignored and will leave you alone|`|AA11387405	tell her to stop acting like a kindergartner and worry more about how she looks and make fun of her shoes|`|4LSrx8L0aa	trip her or tell her shes a b**** it was none of her business|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	ignore her|`|lQR9fYGhaa	tackle her and rub her face in horse sh!t|`|ZiYLLh6Iaa	tell her to leave you alone, if she doesn't, tell the teacher, to be honest most of the time, they pick on you because they are jealous of you, or Start crying and get her in trouble, but she obviously isn't your friend if she picks on you, or kick her puny butt<br>  <br>  Anyway why are you moving class because one girl picks on you|`|hLHP5OvKaa	Go along with it.  I've had people tease me like that too.  I just ignore them or go along with it.  Trust me, trying to insult them back doesn't work.  It makes things worse.  If you go along with it or ignore it and they'll stop.  Don't leave 4-H just because some little punk is teasing you.  You can't let one person get in your way.  Keep perservering and I hoped this helped you.  Good luck!|`|RxSiWBJjaa	Aww, Sweetheart, don't quit 4H because of her..Here is what you need to do, and I can almost guarantee that it will work..When she says your hair is ugly, You say "I  know, I wish my hair was pretty like yours"  When she says your clothes are ugly, you say, "I know, I wish my clothes were as nice as yours"..Everything she says to you that is mean, tell her you wish your (whatever) was as nice as hers..She will stop teasing you because it will no longer be any fun for her..Please try this and please do not quit something you enjoy because of a bully..I promise it will stop if you try this..good luck Sweetie..|`|Zs6OLMnoaa	Look her in the eyes, smile sweetly, and say "You know, if you were a bit nicer I might consider being your friend."  She obviously has self-esteem issues and you shouldn't quit 4-H because of her.  Don't take it personally, she is the one with the problem.  No matter where you go, unfortunately there will always be people like this so don't run away, just face it.|`|iI23RfcZaa	punch her in the face!!!!! I was in 4-h too. I loved it! It doesnt matter what other people think of you. Its what you think that counts. I only let what the people close to me think get to me. I know this is gonna sound corney and everybody says it but its true. she is prolly just jealous or thinks the same thing about herself and it makes her feel better to put someone else down. I have a sister that does the same thing to me, but i just sympathise for her and compliment her when i can.|`|2sl5Rl9qaa	This girl is a *****! If I were you, I would tease her back. If she says anything, smile and ignore her. Become friends with a more popular girl so that your friend can watch your back for you. Worst comes to worse Tell her she has a crooked nose and no lips. <br>  Gd luck!|`|UBbTBHi4aa	Tease her back and make fun of her or just act like its nothing and smile  =)|`|4wWxzcH1aa	kick her ***.|`|yJd1H8C9aa	ya ignore her. dont read into it.|`|tugUQ7R6aa	Tell someone! like an adult. <br>  <br>  dont take that!|`|GEy1yN8waa	Slap her<br>  Don't care what the teachers say... i don't
mtOVRAnbaa	ALWAYS try and start fresh with each new relationship! Its hard and sometimes it frustrates you.. But if you dont atleast show some trust your going to make the relationship worse than it needs to be.. Think of it this way if she's done nothing to make her untrustworthy then trust should be there until proven otherwise..|`|m4T0IT0yaa	It's not easy at all to learn to trust again once that has been broken.  But you can learn something about yourself first.  Take a good look at the type of women you are/were attracted to in the past.  Was there any commonalities?  Are they the type of women that were untrustworthy no matter what?  Sometimes we keep dating the same type of people and they really aren't good people deep down and then we wonder why we keep getting hurt.  Take things slowly.  Trust should earned not just given away like candy at Halloween.  Let the next woman earn it.  But don't make it impossible either.  Little steps towards trusting lets us take bigger steps later on.  Be cautious and a bit mysterious yourself without lying or cheating and see if you can't get that back for yourself too.  Good luck.|`|EhfGorc9aa	Don't get involved with anyone for awhile.  You need time to reflect and recover from what happened in those prior relationships.  Ask yourself:  How could you have had any part in what happened?  Did it actually happen or did you maybe imagine the worst and believe it?  Sometimes reflecting on comments the ex said might help.  Sexual compatibility is a big part of it, and attentiveness.  Or sometimes they might have just met someone who swept them off their feet, were not that into you, or just not a monogamous type...liked "variety."   Once you come to terms with that, then you can have a stronger footing in knowing what qualities and who you want in the next relationship so that you do not repeat the same mistakes.  Communication and commitment discussion is important.    Take your time and don't take the first one who comes along.|`|KZlgdMeEaa	theres nothing anyone can say to hlep u get over what she did.. And as hard as we try sometimes u just end up with baggage from the past that stays in your mind. the only thing u can do is keep reminding yourself that not every woman is like ur ex|`|ca7542594b89a18dd875dc5253650b82aa	you might get some counseling it is rather cheap and will help you see a bad relationship before it goes to far. might help heal some of wounds.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	it takes time to get over being hurt.  dont rush it.
4RiziMD0aa	all male want to be dominant in any relationship. He can't help it and maybe he might even be self conscious about it especially since you are older. personally i like a man in charge and i like a younger man myself, can you answer my question relating to a younger man too. i know if i got him i wouldn't care if he tries to be more dominant because its hot, you'd secretly be dominant for allowing him to be sometimes, us women have the control like that even if they don't know it. good luck! and yes i agree sex doesn't solve anything really its just good.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I don't think he is acting any differently than he normally would in a relationship with someone younger. This nonsense about women being more mature is just that...nonsense, as you do not seem any more mature than he does. Why would you want to be dominated by someone who is less mature, and overcompensates anyway? That says a lot about you as well.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	I don't think he is trying to be that way it just sounds like that's how he is. Just hold your own and be careful because some men don't like a woman that they can push around, and I don't mean physically. This could make him lose interest in you.|`|5vO61nuvaa	I tend to lean toward younger men, although I have dated guys my own age and a little older. In my experience, age does not dictate maturity level as one of the oldest guys I ever dated turned out to be the most child-like of them all. My advice would be to put the age issue aside and focus on the person he is, not the number. And, also, if anyone else (family, friends, etc) have a problem with his age then let it be known that it doesn't matter when they think.. you're the one dating him, not them. If he makes you happy then they should be happy for you, period. Take it day by day and don't base the relationship on anything other then how happy you guys make each other.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	Girl who cares that he is younger....maybe he'll teach you some new things that you don't know!! Or, maybe you can teach him somethings!!<br>  As long as he treats you right, and you're happy I would say go go it!|`|ZRvVKoA2aa	My boyfriend is almost two months younger than me.  I dont even think about it at all.|`|PXN7r0RRaa	i am a young guy.. all young guys want is sex.. so they go to older girls..|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	Relationships should be enjoyable no matter what. Keep him. Explain to him how you really feel. I don't think younger men try harder to be men at all. Men are just men. All of them want sex. The only thing is, a 20 year old might not be ready to settle down just yet. If your relationship is good, keep him. If you really love each other then stay together. If you suspect that he's playing games, just talk to him about how you feel and what you want in the relationship. And if the two of you can't come to an agreement, then that's where your problems start....|`|LykjWv6faa	I personally love older men. Younger men these days are just too immature and unstable for me. For those that disagree with me: If I'm wrong, then how come so many pregnant teens end up as single mothers?
HskBEA3naa	just keep doing cute things 4 her but not too cute if she's kinda tom-boyish<br>  then if u give her a really good present she might like put a note in there that says like "Be Mine" or someting like that<br>  =3|`|lKyL5Josaa	tell her how you feel and see what she says.  i wish my bf still treated me like that

I would detail the kitchen cabinets with a wet rag, clean out my whole refridgerator, clean out my closet, reorganize my drawers, scrub the bathtub.  <br>  <br>  - Try your hardest to not be alone and if you are go over to a friends house.  <br>  <br>  The MAIN thing is keeping yourself busy and your mind occupied enough so you won't have him stuck in your mind ALL day.  I know when the day is gone and it's time to go to bed, you can't help yourself but to think of him, but atleast during the day try to keep him OUT.<br>  <br>  I know it sucks, its one of the worst feelings in the world.

But once when I am hooked, if a girl has no personality. Then I am walking.|`|rqNb6FIraa	It depends on the guy! Not every single guy goes for the same type of girl so if being all into fashion or being shy just isn't you then don't try and pretend because in the end he won't like you at all. Come up with your own style and stick to it because guys like it when a girl in confident in just being herself. and most guys think it's trashy when girls wear a lot of make-up so wear just enough to make yourself look pretty, don't over do it! And i love love love when guys smell good! So i imagine that they would want us to smell nice too!|`|y5xrKPxMaa	It just depends on the boy, one may like girls to wear make-up another may not and its the same for all of the other questions.

I like sporty-ish girls.<br>  <br>  I kinda like the quiet girls.  Idk why.<br>  <br>  Haha, isn't that the question you should answer for me?|`|cfFlf1EAaa	Well all guys aren't the same. Each guy look for different things in a female. Some guys like how a female carry herself. We like a friendly girl that loves to have fun. A girl that is smart a takes good care of her self. A girl that really respects herself as well as others around her. So I would say too much make-up wouldnt matter. Just be yourself there is someone 4 everyone.|`|fSkt7SgDaa	I like a girl that is pretty without makeup but looks even better when she puts it on. <br>  I don't care what she wears. <br>  I prefer girls that are quiet for the most part but outspoken when they need to be.|`|Jhr68T0baa	Who cares?|`|0jIycwp8aa	they like their eyebrows. the bigger the better!|`|RoyvUWl7aa	Gosh, I'm a girl...I don't know|`|iJbslaQNaa	i agree with Strange on the outside|`|a1iam8Zvaa	ugh wut a dumb question<br>  thye love a hot body and a pretty face|`|yIqYnqk3aa	This is my opinion!!!

If you accepted to be his girlfriend knowing he is a little overweight, then deal with it or  find a thinner boyfriend! You can't make someone do something that they don't want to do. I am sure he is aware of his weight. If he wanted to lose weight he would.
UZBqOjy7aa	You shouldn't compare what worldly goods you have to offer, because at the end of the day, it will be what you have to offer emotionally that matters. I don't think that looks and personality that matter. If she's a women who only cares about what money you have to offer, than she's probably not good enough for you anyways. Like I said, if you connect with her emotionally, than build your relationship off that, not material things.|`|cyFqjkolaa	I would not be scared but this can be difficult depending on the various attitudes involved.  If they really do live on different social levels these things will be very hard to overcome.  <br>  <br>  If one is going to be threatened by her position or the other is going to be embarrassed by his they should rethink as this will lead to pain.|`|GwXJpZWKaa	no|`|R0U4qy6haa	do you talk about others as much as you talk about yourself|`|ZJdeXNiHaa	I wouldn't be afraid to be her boyfriend, but I'd be nervous that she would try to leave me for someone else because she's so independent.  I'd rather date a rich successful woman though than someone that couldn't even finish college.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	People base to much on money, it really doesn't matter if you like someone. The class system might interfere with a long term relationship if her family are snobs though.

018yIBJlaa	Block her on msn and ignore her. This girl is immature and you both need to get over this. The best thing to do is to tell someone so you can get her off your back before it gets worse. <br>  <br>  Good luck =]]|`|amKkfPS2aa	Be the bigger person. She sounds like a drama queen and you don't need people like that in your life. Besides that, she wasn't a friend to begin with anyway, so just say "I'd rather not; not because I'm scared but because I want to get beyond this." Maybe if you kill her with kindness, she'll change, and then you two can bond. If not, though, agree to just be friendly acquaintances and then block her. From then on, avoid any contact other than being kind, and she won't be able to hurt you because she won't be getting what she wants. She won't be your enemy anymore, but she won't be your friend either, and then you can basically stay out of each other's way; being casual but keeping your distance. Also, most importantly, find some new friends who would never lay a violent hand on you. Obviously I can honestly tell you that's not what friendship is about!
07L1TwNraa	As far as fooling around...I like it when they pull on my shirt, hold me tight, etc. Where you put your hands is important but it depends on the guy. I also like when the girl initiates the more sexual things first.

AA10065812	??????????<br>  I'm sorry to say that yes, you could be hit with court costs, and even be ordered to pay her child support, which happens in about 10% of the cases.<br>  <br>  Do you have any evidence that she is hiding assets?  Or, is she living off a boyfriend?<br>  <br>  You need to learn to do three things.<br>  <br>  Child support enforcement should provide you with legal counsel to fight a decrease.  They do this for women.  Have a female friend go in and ask first about it, before you ask, just in case;<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you need to learn how to hire an attorney without draining your wallet; and<br>  <br>  How to put together a team of Court Watchers to monitor and report on the Judge's actions to prove any bias on his part.<br>  <br>  As for her not working, she should be on unemployment.  If she's been denied it, that can be grounds for denying a modification in child support, because she got fired or quit.  If she's on unemployment, it can be attached for up to 55% to cover the payment plus an additional 50% to go toward the arrears.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

And suing for costs is standard legal procedure, whether you're entitled to them or not.  <br>  <br>  She may get a reduction (that does not absolve her of her prior arrears) but it's unlikely that she will be awarded costs.  In fact, you should be suing her for costs.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	i think if you would have slapped her around a bit earlier in life she would have fallen in line a little better.|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	she will have to pay, at least you are better off like that.|`|APy56tkZaa	Judges see this sort of thing all the time.<br>  Just remember to focus on the facts of the situation.<br>  Her amount in arrears isn't going to change.<br>  She has the ability to pay child support & chooses not to, I have a very low opinion of people like that (currently my ex is over $12k in arrears, but for some reason he hasn't been arrested or brought to court over it).<br>  CSE only works if you stay on top of them!<br>  <br>  I say get the attorney.<br>  <br>  Your children need you to be a lion on their side.<br>  To have their best interests at heart.<br>  She obviously doesn't think this way & wants to weasel out of her obligations.|`|ca7542594b89a18dd875dc5253650b82aa	my recent experience is that the judge sees through the BS so state your case clearly and then see what happen. the crying woman does not work.

I wish you luck|`|CgEQAgXhaa	I think the judge would go more your way.  You are the primary caretaker.  I highly doubt you will have to pay her court costs.  The judge would probably laugh her out over that.  Her case is 'im not paying child support because im not working.  Im taking him to court to lower the payments on something im not paying now.  Oh yeah, and i want him to pay my court costs.'  She will look like a fool in court.  I don't see why she wants to go to court when she hasnt been paying you.  That will likely cause more trouble for her.

I told him the same thing you said, and he also did not take it very well. It does not mean u guys are gonna break up, just that you need some time for your seld. You guys are not married and there is no need for you two to be together ALL the time. Well in my case, although I had to bring it up several times which caused arguments, he got the point and now we see each other every other day and every weekend. He does not call me as much and we are definitely in a better road than before.

vdfEE7WTaa	Adults bullying kids is the worst kind of bullying actually. But with this choice I'd say adult.<br>  See, when an adult bullies anyone it's tricky because you think of bullying as something that happens amongst people within certain age groups. So you might not realize the maliciousness of the comments /actions and take them to heart. Also, if a kid bullies you you can tell a teacher but if an adult bullies you it's really confusing.|`|yDVlTUYTaa	Adults bullying each other is more subtle and can be brushed off and walked away from. Most adults are emotionally equipped to handle a bully and won't sit by and ignore those who are bullying someone else, thereby putting peer pressure on the bully to change his behavior.<br>  Teen bullying often escalates into something more whether physical or whatnot and is a harder confrontation to ignore. Also, teenagers tend to care more about what their peers think of them and what reputation they have and because of that feel that the bully is defining who they are to the rest of their peers. Most of their peers will be too afraid to intervene since it would risk the bully turning on them as well.<br>  <br>  So, yeah, neither one is fun. I think teens are harder pressed since they are emotionally unprepared, stand alone and face the added physical threat.<br>  <br>  Solutions??? It would depend on the situation. Stay away from the bully if that's possible. Surround yourself with loyal friends. Seek intervention from an authority if necessary. Confront the bully if possible with other standing with you.<br>  When it is a teen, get parents involved, be as specific as possible about what's been said and done and ask that it stops. If things escalate and all other routes fail, the police will have to intervene. And for threats or physical violence, you can obtain a temporary restraining order. Not a bad option.|`|AA10500537	teen age bullying cause grown ups can  handle it themselves and kids take it to heart and  get depressed|`|f625761b9315ce30edb7ef310c33bf77aa	teenage bulling. For kids these days, when they are bullied, they end up having serious mental and emotional problems with other people. They sometimes even become anti-social in the long run because of their past. As for adults, they have been through enough experience to just simply move on and ignore the situation, or stand up for themselves. Adults are independent. Even as kids they have to be independent, we can't rely on our parents any more than we do with situations like bulling at school or else there'd be name calling, teasing, usually making a conflict worse. <br>  <br>  good luck and best wishes :)|`|TOY5CvcJaa	I think teenage bulling is worse. As adults we know how to ignore it and move on. We need to teach are children to do the same.
7wng2AJDaa	The whole "my husband and kid are sleeping in the next room" thing could have just been a part of the fantasy.    To be honest it's usually a guy on the other end and what better way to cover that reality up than by pretending to be married to a man that they have a child with.  It obviously has you believing that this is a woman, right.   <br>  <br>  <br>  The fact is, SL is not about reality.  The individual can be whoever they want to be, it's a fantasy world.  Don't worry about others.  Just use the site for what you want to use it for, conversation and passing time, and leave it at that.

Chances are it was, but just to be clear there is no guarantee until you actually meet her.  <br>  <br>  Second, it's not uncommon for married people to look for a little excitement online once in a while.  My guess is that she didn't actually want to meet to have sex.  She just wanted to know that she COULD if she wanted to.  <br>  <br>  My advice is that if you want to chat and fart around online, then great.  But when it comes to real life relationships with real life people, nothing compares to doing things the old fashioned way.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Don't feel bad for "her", that other person was probably a 55 year old, 300 lb, single GUY, sitting in his mom's basement, looking for a quick, cheap, perverted thrill.

Of course, it takes two, so the men are doing it too!  Its not just married women, its married men too!  It is a form of "emotional infidelity" and increasingly it is ruining real life marriages.   It can lead to them meeting live and in person too.  It is really sad, and hurtful.  When I found my ex-husband doing this 8 years before I finally divorced him (we had 2 small kids), (& it was a diff Virtual Avatar site before SL) , with an alleged young married stripper with two kids across the country (having showers together in virtual hotel rooms), it was shattering...especially when I found that he had invited her into a community chat room with his real life co-workers, as an on-line hot friend, and I was excluded, as the "wife" who would not "understand."  Personally, I prefer to live in the real world and I don't know how you can know in advance what women or men would indulge in such behavior, other than asking them early on and hope they are honest.  Good luck!  Its a more challenging time for relationships than ever. People who do that need to get a REAL life....or develop some character...they are the people who would cheat in real life given the opportunity, are perhaps looking, or would if they weren't scared or if they thought they could get away with it.|`|FzFSzilmaa	most people in SL are there for some kind of cybering experience... and many go on to webcam... she was rejected by you and so moved on...<br>  <br>  people on SL are unhappy with their real lives (similar on WoW and Everquest) and are looking for some passion or naughty banter... if you aren't into it, fine... but don't knock other people who need it to feel better about themselves... cos they are unhappy or low self-esteem or need to feel wanted...|`|eWMn7dhKaa	SL (Second Life for those who don't know) is what you would call a haven for people to interact with each other online as you can basically build and make your own avatar and/or place to be what you want it to be like, it is literally a Second Life for a reason.  You can work there for money running a business or working for someone and have cyber sex and talk to other people and play games and have a jolly good time doing things you can do in your First Life with the exception of actually touching another person.<br>  <br>  Everything else is fair game, though.<br>  <br>  Whether the person you were dealing with was a female or not does not really matter, she could have been single, she could have been 14 or 66 or 33, again it doesn't really matter.  What does matter is that she is looking to have some sexy time with someone and it was not you, so she has moved on.<br>  <br>  I believe that would be called cheating and is generally frowned upon in society.|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	A lot of people married and single masturbate (90+ % men and 69 % women) at some time in their life, Masturbation is a part of their sexuality.

Look for the movie at anyplace that rents/sells DVDs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fireproofmymarriage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fireproofmymarriage.com/</a>|`|IqqaA2wIaa	see if the person will go to counseling with you....I do wish you luck but he needs to be willing to fix things....ask him whats wrong..|`|AaCJBM7qaa	i know what you are going through, but at least he told you that his feelings had changed. my husband up and left taking with him everything that we bought together. he changed his cell and i dont know where he is. i was hurt and angry at first and now i am just devistated because i cant believe it has gotten this far. we had a rocky six month period and i asked him to go to counseling but he wouldn't. you may not like his response, but at least you got an answer. go to counseling...drag him!!!|`|ca7542594b89a18dd875dc5253650b82aa	I partially agree with Sara, look at what has made the marriage so routing and see if that is what both of you want. You may be comfortable in that situation but it has gotten boring.. for him. what do you both want! Once that is decided then you can work towards it.|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	I guess he is not in love with you!|`|n5DlXdsCaa	I know by the time I've typed out all I want to say a lot of people will have answered, but it doesn't matter. Here we go. <br>  Tell your husband that you want to know what's on his mind - don't worry about the little things right now, just talk about what's jeaprodizing your marriage. I've heard it said that marriage is a series of falling in and out of love - it will suffer. Just be supportive, don't turn him into a villian, and don't yet upset. Try to talk, as I said before, but don't make him talk. Keep being a great wife - you may have to carry a little more weight for a while, but it's worth it if it saves your marriage. Also, pray about it. Pray for him every day; your love for him will grow and if you get right with God everything will fall into place. 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 says: “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” That's what you do. I hope it turns out, I'll be praying. God Bless,<br>  Aimee

I love the look of these DIY frames <br>  <a href="http://www.xanga.com/SoonToBMrsB/549722391/diy-non-floral-centerpieces/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xanga.com/SoonToBMrsB/5497223...</a><br>  I made one last weekend and it was gorgeous when lit with a fake candle, and it is an affordable option as well.  I am surrounding mine with river rocks and votive candles, because we just dont have money in our budget for floral centerpieces.<br>  <br>  I also like the airy light feeling of these vellum flowers, I bet you could find vellum in ivory and maybe find a cobalt blue vase to stick them in<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brides.com/planning/flowers/feature/slide/161790#_slide=161792_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/planning/flowers/f...</a><br>  <br>  I might do these on a couple of tables or rotate them.  Good Luck|`|qDBjH4s8aa	Use your favors as part of the centerpiece, so they work double duty. For my sister's wedding, she's doing individual boxes of chocolate tied with a ribbon in her wedding color. The boxes will be around a galvanized bucket holding a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white wine (for table consumption, also double duty). Totally simple. <br>  <br>  For table numbers she's doing pictures of herself and the groom at their respective ages, in a frame that matches the bucket. For example, table 4 would have pictures of the both of them at 4 years old. All you need is a scanner, some pictures, and the frames.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Flowers, fresh. Clear vases work well and you can get them relatively inexpensively. Flowers you can buy bulk local and then arrnage yourself or have your family and friends help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XVzAey4qaa	My favorite homemade centerpieces are beautiful bowls of water with floating candles or roses.  You can even color the water to match your flowers or bridesmaids dresses.  This is always beautiful and classy.
JYgJD0Rwaa	No, there is no way to make him attend counceling. I have heard that some state require mediation or some type of counceling before they'll allow a divorce, however its rare. <br>  He could be suffering from depression, its not the best time to make such a rash decision..however if he's made it, and filed for divorce, there isn't anything you can do. Nor should you -- you don't want to be married to someone who clearly doesn't want the relationship anymore.
bttrB0Rfaa	He's one of those all or nothing people.<br>   He was interested in you then felt in your actions you aren't codependent enough for things to work with you 2. <br>  So now he has to act like he doesn't care & never did<br>  All  or  Nothing|`|b3zGfYMpaa	No, guy would pay that kind of attention to you if he did just see you as a friend. My intuition tells me this guy is hurt that you wanted to keep it on a friendship basis and now hes avoiding you so that he could better move on and not deal with any sour emotions. Is it possible that you lead this guy on? Maybe not intentionally, but perhaps thats why hes taking it so hard that he must go to extremes and ignore you all together. With that said, maybe you should ask him to reinstate a relationship with you, but make it clear this time that your only interested in being friends. If he cant hack it oh well...|`|72688aae7e472777b624289e7b6159acaa	he came on too strong...and I think texting is a poor way to communicate with someone you dont know well....  you probably arent into him....let it go.|`|fqboOITjaa	I think you're both playing eachother! Not replying to texts too soon or not at all! That's playing games!|`|nxi6ODkAaa	He thought that you wasnt into him|`|VH00G8Isaa	i'd just text him first, and ask what's up<br>  then let it go from there|`|rbTS0XHkaa	I have been in the same situation as you really. I went out with this person who wouldn't stop texting and ringing me. I started to feel really uncomfortable so i had to dump him. I wouldn't say that you were played, i'd say that he was really into you but started to realise you were not into him if you were kinda ignoring him. I get why you did that though. <br>  <br>  My advice is to just stay with your friends because boys are all the same.
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	He can have his cake and eat it to. It doesn't matter if he has a psychiatric condition (addiction) or not, you put up with it, you're still with him, so what's the problem?<br>  <br>  I know what I would do if my wife was like this, but that's me. I also know what my wife would do if I was like that. The word divorced comes to mind.|`|IWzYB44raa	You need to divorce him before you end up with a STD.<br>  He has a problem, and it's not your fault.  He will probably always be like this or get worse.  You deserve better.|`|2sF0qPjBaa	Your husband is a complete A**Hole!!!! If this was my husband he would be out the door. Seriously read what you wrote and GET A CLUE!!!!!|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Sounds more like he's just a jerk.|`|5mlCFI8Baa	This may be an Ouch but you need to take a break from the relationship and let him know that this behavior is unacceptable. The problem with men is that once they have you trapped in the relationship with children they think yhey can do what they want. I have watched other peoples husbands walk all over them. You are not a door mat.|`|HOjwnpmUaa	Try to act like him: go to porn sites, talk about other men... See if he'll like it. Maybe then he'll stop acting like a jerk. ;)|`|3fwJBhJdaa	Sound like he's lying and cheating. Dump him. Get checked out for disease like in venereal disease.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Its all up to you what you will accept for his behavior or not.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Possibly a sex addict, but more likely just a jerk who has no respect for you or your marriage. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but from what you've said, it's likely that he's sleeping around.  And he doesn't feel bad about it either.
GsrLh50laa	Yes, you can divorce at this time. You can get everything you need to file for divorce on your own without an attorney at - <a href="http://www.legalformsbank.biz/uncontesteddivorceforms.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.legalformsbank.biz/unconteste...</a> - and you can learn more there.|`|2sF0qPjBaa	I don't know who told you that but they are wrong. You can get a divorce whenever you feel like it. If you don't have money try to get your husband to pay your attorney fees. There are also places who will do pro bono work, maybe they would take your case.<br>  <br>  It is worth looking into, but if you are that unhappy you should file for divorce, and at the very least a legal separation.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	if you are thinking about a devorce, he might be thinking about a divorce too. in fact he might be thinking first i need to sell the house so he can take the money easier.and leave you with nothing,so you need to get educated on what might be happening right know.you need to figure out where are you gonna live and how are you gonna pay the rent, if you file for devorce today, you might be able to keep the house for yourself, then if you don't want the house you can sell it and keep all the money. what you need to do is talk to a lawyer and talk to women who have been thew a devorce. if you have not worked then you need to get him to pay you allimony. and you need to plan to empty out the accounts before he does.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	You have to file for divorce in your legal state of residence, that usually means where you've lived for the past 6 months (residency laws vary by state)<br>  As far as the money and benefits, he could remove you if they are his policies. It would look very badly on him when you both attend court if he was to do so, but he could do it.<br>  If he removed the money from the bank accounts, he would also get nailed for that in court, especially since they're joint accounts and you do not work. He would be abandoning you,.judges don't look highly upon that.<br>  Its clear you won't have an uncontested (agreed upon) divorce, so you should STRONGLY consider speaking to a lawyer in this case, otherwise he'll leave you high & dry.
iRZ4Y2bLaa	Breaking up is hard. It happens. Fortunately for you, you haven't been with him for a long time.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you call him, if this makes you nervous then maybe en email. Apologize  to him, even if it may not be your fault. Let him know that you care about him and that you want to give him time to come around, if he wants to.<br>  <br>  Then leave him alone. Yeah it sound harsh, but leave him alone. no calling, texting, emailing, myspacing, nothing.<br>  <br>  When he is ready he will come around, and if he does but he does not want to be with you, then be his friend if you truly care for him. And if not then move on...<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.|`|ls3TD7Teaa	apparantly he is not intrested, i hate to say it but breaking up over a text is the lowest you can get.  dont worry about myspace, it is not worth it to be upset over it, dont call him try not to talk to him, see how that works out. please take my advice:) good luck:) i hope that i helped:)|`|dfBbvqb0aa	My advice would be just don't talk to him for a week. If he really likes/cares for you i am sure he will be coming back to you and saying he made a big mistake...|`|Q32qXErCaa	give him time---dont chase he will run faster than you--|`|T5aH1Kssaa	Try to keep contact with him but just as friends if you still have feelings for him he could come around!|`|K1oOQqqVaa	I think if he wants to be friends that he will tell YOU.|`|giEXhSTIaa	He doesn't sound worth your time. he dumped you by text, he's a coward. I say move on, spend time with your real friends and you'll meet a nice guy who is worth being with. :)|`|a1k0Mw8taa	i've been in that situation (i'm a guy). don't talk to him. it will make it worse. wait a week and if he hasn't said anything maybe try to say hi but nothing more. start out slow|`|FaS3CT5waa	i wouldnt talk to him, if he wants to be friends he will come around<br>  trust dont push it with these kind of things..he just needs some time....|`|AA10500537	let it go he wants you out of his life,<br>  find a new friend and  don.t bother him|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	My advise would be don't give him any of your time.  He disrespected you by not telling you in person.  If you were still friends he wouldn't have deleted you from his myspace.  He basically deleted you out of his life.  I'd say you weren't on good terms with him.  In my eyes he's less than a man for not having the guts to break up with you in person.  Let him go and live your own life.  You will find a real man that respects you because he's a coward to say the least.    Don't try to contact you or it will look like you are chasing him
Hfp80ylEaa	Don't listen to anyone saying to use the wedding and finances for revenge.   If it can be established you went through with it solely to inflict financial damage they can file a suit and try and collect compensation from you.<br>  <br>  If you really must get revenge, embarrassing photos are a good method.  Especially in the digital and internet age where they're basically permanent.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	why dont you just be the bigger person and leave him?<br>  <br>  dont stoop to his level, because thats just as bad as what he did|`|mZlPj8Guaa	I think both of you should call off the wedding. If you cannot solve your problems without resorting to revenge, then you have to honestly say that you both are not ready to spend the rest of your lives together.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	umm advice: you can't fight fire with fire, you'll just get burned. if you have this type of immature mentality your marriage will definitely not last.|`|OHydEvTCaa	um you need to stop playing childish games and talk to you "fiance" to find out if you two should even get married in the first place.|`|qxrr69bnaa	The best revenge you could have would be to find someone that will treat you like you deserve to be treated and get over the cheating SOB.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	That marriage is going to last.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	are you guys still together or broken up and you just want to get back at him?<br>  <br>  Don't stoop to anything childish like trying to make him jealous by hearing another man. Be the bigger person and the best revenge is showing that you've moved on and don't care. Get your hair done and go out with your girlfriends. Best case scenario- you see your ex out while you are looking hot, having fun, and maybe flirting with the bartender or some guy. <br>  Worst case, you have fun with your friends and get your mind off him for awhile. <br>  Cheater suck, I am sorry doll!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ok but if that doesn't work and you really want to hurt him, pour old sardines in the vents on the outside hood of his car. He will never be able to get that out!! <br>  <br>  haha that's horrible don't really do that. laughing about thinking about doing it is fun too|`|wy9rgMGsaa	The best "Revenge" would be to leave him, that would be the best way to show him what he did was wrong, also...this is supposed to be a very happy time in your relationship, and if hes already cheating I think its a very terrible idea to get married!|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	I don't think revenge is going to make you feel better about what he did to you. If you really want this to work out then you guys need to seek couples counseling. You need to work past this if you want to be married, otherwise your marriage will fail.|`|by9KuBizaa	A word about revenge.   It might feel good at the time but you will regret it two minutes after the deed occurs.<br>  <br>  Hold on to your dignity and don't seek revenge.  The only thing revenge accomplishes is that it makes you look bad|`|JbYJhhbvaa	My revenge would be "to leave him" That would be the best revenge & no words would have to be spoken.

aUZLy4dkaa	the person you think you like more is purely because you know you cant have him. you and your boyfriend are just going though a rough patch and you are looking at other options rather then trying to sort your problems out.<br>  i think you need to spend some time with your boyfriend and sort your problems out together as a couple. If this doesnt work out then maybe as a couple you should decide to call it a day then from there you can start looking at a new boyfriend. but till you know where you stand in your relation ship you should really do everything you can to save it.|`|kkCF1oSzaa	clearly, you're not happy in your current relationship. i think your insecurities of your relationship with him are getting the better of you, and you seem like you're looking for a way out. it comes down to how you feel about it. perhaps you and your boyfriend should take a break, spend time away from each other, to clear your head and think about what you're going to do. then when you've come to a decision, speak to them both about it. let them know what you've decided. make sure that when you tell them, you speak from your heart, and not your head. let the words come naturally|`|Jn0Los9baa	I would be with the one who loves me for me. But remember that communication is the key to any relationship.
AA10065812	??????????<br>  In states like Missouri, all the mother has to do is deny the father access to the children, in order to allow her new husband to adopt without the approval of the father.<br>  <br>  So, what do you do?<br>  <br>  For 20 years I've worked with divorced and single fathers<br>  <br>  Part of the problem with getting visitation enforced is knowing what to do to prove your case, and how to remind the judge of their responsibilities.  Let me start with the judge.<br>  <br>  Always take people with you to court who are not there to testify.  Make sure they are sitting where the judge can see them, each equipped with a tablet and pen to take notes.  It’s best to use a Court Watch Form designed for this purpose.  I have one in the manual at Dads House.<br>  <br>  If the judge is not doing his job, using the info from this form, he/her sanctioned and/or removed from the case.  You file a complaint with the State Supreme Court at your state capital.<br>  <br>  It’s most important that you keep a daily journal of all your activities. There does not need to be any violence for a claim of violence to be filed. She gets a restraining order because she fears him because she has been preventing him from seeing her child.  A restraining order can be filed up to a year after a supposed even in most states.  With the journal, you can look back and see what you were doing that day and who were witnesses to it, such as being 30 miles away, as was the case with one of my members.  Please note that when the mother is unsuccessful in a false allegation og domestic violence, within two years she will progress to child abuse and child sexual abuse allegations.<br>  <br>  Many think that all the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights. This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney. It is also important to do as much of the leg work on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.<br>  <br>  If you are being denied access, write her a letter notifying her of intent to exercise visitation rights on the specific date as laid out in your order. Make two copies, and sign all three. Mail two of them, one certified and one with Delivery Confirmation (75￠ + postage).  If she rejects the one, she still receives the other. If the certified letter comes back, file it unopened. By use of an internet connection, you can print out the Confirmation of Delivery for the other letter.<br>  <a href="http://www.usps.com/send/waystosendmail/extraservices/deliveryconfirmationservice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usps.com/send/waystosendmail/...</a> <br>  <br>  When you show up, bring witnesses. Do not enter her place alone. If you can record, have someone video record from the car. Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record audio and/or video without the mother knowing. If her state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling, which says one person in a conversation, must know they are being recorded.  THAT’S YOU!<br>  <br>  In Missouri, it is specifically legal, while in Kansas there is no mention either way. With two different states, if one has a law against it, than you can record phone calls that originated in the state where it’s legal.  If it’s legal in her state, than when she calls you, than you can record.  I’ve heard of cases where the father lives just across the state line, crossing the state line than calling the mother on his cell phone and recording it.<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can’t just record, you also have to transcribe the conversations your daily journal.<br>  <br>  One complaint is that the kids won’t come, but that is likely to be a symptom of Parental Alienation Syndrome.<br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a><br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this, go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.

Was it stipulated in your divorce that neither of you can leave the state without the others permission? <br>  <br>  IF you give up rights to your children, the obviously you give up ALL rights - including having to pay support. Once you do that, you CANNOT go BACK and change it.  The courts will NOT reverse an adoption decision YOU agreed to, period.

Sometimes it helps to get a visual. You can also go to Davids Bridal and try their "Dress Your Wedding" program. This way you can see how the olive green will look with different color bouquets.|`|AA11780840	The colors yellow and white are ok .... I was wondering what are the colors of the Bridesmaids colors : are they white and Olive Green?<br>  I was a brides maid and I wore a darker green on the olive side with white trim.... The bride chose mostly white and yellow  and red roses . They were beautiful. <br>  <br>  Maybe for the bride (yourself ) could have mixed bouquet of tulips, roses and gerberas<br>  <br>  If you are still a little stumped you could take a sample of the bridesmaids' dresses to your florist so that ribbon, trim, and flower colors can be closely matched.  The florist will then know the color scheme of your wedding and can add visual interest to the bridesmaids' dresses with the flowers chosen.  Make sure your florist knows whether you want seasonal flowers or headdresses for your bridesmaids. <br>  <br>  The bridesmaids and their flowers surround and complement the bride's beauty so that she stands out on her special day. <br>  <br>  Also, each bridesmaid might carry a bouquet made of one flower type or color to mirror the bride's bouquet.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|zll28kQ1aa	depends on what colour your flowers are and what colour there dresses are.|`|cj4nIaQTaa	There are many  colors that can go with Oolive green.

Tell him first you have a birthmark and you're a bit self conscious about it - that way he will at least know and it won't be a surprise, and also he'll have the knowledge that you're uncomfortable about it & hopefully be really nice about it :)
UKZ1Bhlnaa	well like you said you have broke up before so there was a reason for that i would stick with the girl you have a the moment because if you leave her for the other Girl then you might be loosing out on a lot and if you got out with the other girl and she dumps you you gf at the moment isn't gonna wanna take you back and then you would of wished you hadn't dumped her in the first place !|`|XzWLcQmqaa	well the reality is you said you had "been" with her before. so in that case you guys obviously broke up.<br>  she may want you now because you are with someone else.<br>  you fell once you are starting again. you really want to ruin your new relationship on a maybe?<br>  you really need to give what you have now a chance.<br>  it could come out a great thing.<br>  if not then try with the other female again.<br>  but don't sabotage your new relationship to find out.|`|0ozx7T30aa	There is nothing to help with here, this is all your choice.

Apologize nicely and give your regrets.  Don't say anything about not liking it.  If she suggests ways to be more time efficient just stand your ground and say you need the time for school.

I was going through the same situation for my dentist. He did some work on my mouth that he messed up. so he corrected it for free then gave me a free cleaning. afterwards, since i am an accountant, he asked if i cud do some acctng for him and he'd pay. i said sure...not realizing the only time i had 2 do it was the weekend. and i had plans to go out. I didnt do it and called him and he said it was ok. i think he was a little disappointed. but i apologized and was very nice on the phone...im not sure exactly how our relationship is now, but i'm not going to stress about it. If all it was only a favor and you do a good job with the kids...it shudn't be an issue. She knew you had to receive the info on Friday and didnt send it until late friday...then tell her that. Be assertive! Then change the subject and talk about the kids like nothing happened and let her know that you will not be used! i knw its easier said than done...but im sorry for the long message and i hope this helps! :)
qzVGaVWgaa	marriage is a life long union, tell him these feelings that your getting.  the fact that you are having thoughts of other people is a sign that there are problems in your own relationship.  you need to address them together before anything.  you both deserve the honesty, and then you two can go from there.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You are making excuses to make your flirting seem okay.

U married young and the s3x was hot because of the same reason but now u see reality of the mistake u made for marrying young, u have to talk to ur husband about taking marriage counseling because it may also be a case of one new man in ur life who seems to be attracted to u and it makes women doubt their lives, work on ur marriage, stop being so talky-talky with the other man and if u get better, its just a flirt fling and nothing serious but if u think about the other man while ur working on ur marriage and u think he's really REALLY WORTH destroying ur  marriage then u go for it! good luck|`|O8RuSBAjaa	What is it that you are looking for with this other man? It's natural to feel attracted to people outside your marriage. It's also natural to have up and down phases of attraction of interest within a marriage. It would be good to examine what it is you are really looking for before you make any rash decisions about ending your marriage or beginning an extramarital affair. Don't do something that you will later regret...as I have heard too many stories of people who are led away from their spouses by other people and later regret their decision when it is too late.<br>  Before you do anything that will likely cause a good amount of upheaval in your life, ask yourself what you are REALLY looking for, and stay strong until you know.|`|cP03k3cXaa	Your actions have already answered your question. Now take more action, end your current relationship. Especially since his ACTIONS clearly state that he doesn't care to change his behavior. You deserve the best, now convince yourself of that fact and do something about it. Everyone deserves to be treated with equality, your supposed to have someone who loves you back as much as you love them. End your marriage, and go find someone that makes you happy. It takes two to make it, and two to break it. If your husband refuses to take responsibility for his role in your marriage, then move on and be happy. Answer is obvious to me.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	I have to agree with the first answer.  The only thing he is obviously clueless of is that you are going behind his back with another man.

Test the waters by sleeping with Mr. Right-now, and stop having sex with your husband.  Only sleep with him on his birthday, but not on  your anniversary or any other time of year.

It's really up to you and what you think is right.  And even if something you do is a sin, if you didn't know it was a sin then it wont matter unless you do it even after you know it's a sin. <br>  <br>  For instance, a friend of yours were to give you a car and you drove that car for years and then found out that it was stolen.  Would it be a sin?  No.  Unless of course you kept driving the car.<br>  <br>  So for now, do whatever you feel is right and if you happen to find out that something is wrong, just stop doing it.  Easy as that!|`|KNBTViNNaa	Penetration of any kind is the line not to cross. Oral sex is still sex mutual masturbation is still penetration.

8gnp5Kkjaa	First, tell your so called "friends" to quit being douchebags.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, work out your feelings for this guy.  There is no point leading him on if you aren't really interested.<br>  <br>  If you think you might be, then there is no harm in going on a date and seeing if you enjoy the time you spend with him.  If not, then you part ways and no hard feelings.  But if you really enjoy each others' company then there may be something more there that is worth exploring.

It's called the spirit of rejection.  And prayer is the only thing that will help you with-stand it.  Also God may not take it away right away.  I guess he feels those of us he calls and have given beauty and blessing and we ignore his prompting he pulls back and you know who kicks in.  Also be aware sometimes people pray for us in wrong ways so ask God that if anyone is praying wrongly for you to put an end to it.<br>  <br>  I'm truly sorry this is happening to you.<br>  <br>  Before you go out or handle any business school etc...Pray this Prayer<br>  Jesus in eyes of all who sees me.

cqrrcJhBaa	Relationships are built on trust.  You have to trust her until she gives you a reason not to.  Dont jump the gun on this one.  Its not a race to see who can break up with who first.  Just file it in the back of your mind and see what happens in the future.

ghXH7JZRaa	Don't be the giver in every relationship. Don't be clingy and don't act as if the person that you are friends with is the most important person in the world. Depending on how long that you have known this person you always want to take it slow and easy just so you know that this person cares for you the same way that you do. Hang out, spend some time and let the relationships gradually get to that strong point..|`|BY02DhfWaa	how can you just give your concern and trust away like it is so easy to come buy these feelings are precious and that should come in time you. should know someone for at least 2-3 yrs before you just give those feelings away, people can just be so crapy to others you need to harden your heart a little you seem to soft .|`|yIqYnqk3aa	Just care for expecting no results then u'lll automatically get results,i mean to say don't care for sumone to get cared in return just care for sumone from ur heart,datz it,be unselfish!Don't mind!|`|70OHpjySaa	In my experience, taking care of people does not make them take care of you, BUT you will be taking care of by other people who you never took care of.<br>  <br>  I'm always helping people but now that I need help, the people I helped let me down but other people I never helped are there for me, I call it Karma. <br>  <br>  It's not about "I help you now so maybe you can help me later". It's about "I help anybody, whenever I can and one day somebody will help me, whenever he/she can".|`|n7BuH75gaa	You do nothing.<br>  <br>  You don't expect anything.<br>  <br>  Just do what you feel is right and everything should fall into place for you.<br>  <br>  That's really nice of you!<br>  I do the same thing. That's what I have learned, don't expect anything.|`|gWYArJ0Haa	I went threw that. I give 100% and people do half *** attempts. Its a fact of life. Honestly, dont change yourself. You are a good person and you will meet people that dont take advantage of your kindness and caringness. You will fight threw thorns to get to the roses.|`|aaCK25mGaa	well dont be so nice all the time.....they are lucky to have you but they dont know what it takes to love someone like that :D|`|amKkfPS2aa	Ooh, girl, I know exactly how this feels. You don't expect anything from them really, other than to be a good friend to you and then you'll treat them the same way in return, but then they leave you for whatever reason and sometimes come back like nothing happened just when you get over them. And that just leaves you more confused, and then you fall under their spell all over again; maybe even harder than before, and there's nothing you can do about it to turn back or talk to them and yet you realize you weren't that strong after all and you're still helplessly loving them even as you know better and it hurts that they don't care about you back in the same way - if at all. Listen, girl, as I'm typing this and describing it to you I'm having all these painful flashbacks of what I went through that perfectly match it all. You don't deserve to put up with that, you're better than that, and you don't need those people in your life. You should get some new friends who appreciate you, because no matter how imperfect we all are, no real friend should try to hurt you or harm you by mistake with no genuine repentance. Who has constantly, relentlessly caused you more drama, and who's always been there? There you go. You deserve the best, the truest bluest friends, so never settle for less! You can do better, so hold you head up high, stand up to the losers and start the heck over! You go girl! x|`|Mj9n3sVbaa	Some people may just say to forget those people and move on to ones that care more like you. I would disagree with that heartily because there is no such thing as a perfect person. We're all human and as such we all a mess of emotions and insecurities. I can almost guarantee that people in your life are not ignoring you to be mean, but because they are going through their own ups and downs.  Keep caring because the world needs more people like you.<br>  <br>  For your own sanity though maybe consider setting some boundaries with certain individuals so you can make time to nourish your own inner emotional self. Carve out an aspect of you life that you do just for you. The funny thing about that is once you show the world that you respect yourself and your time and your emotional energy, others will follow suit.|`|AA11551690	Keep on caring.  You don't have to make yourself a doormat or necessarily even be around someone all the time to care about them.  It's easy to care for those who care about us and show it.  The real challenge and reward to our spirit is when we continue to care for those who don't seem to "give a hoot".  God bless and keep caring!|`|gpoi6GKtaa	i am going through the same thing with an old friend- i was the only one that gave a damn about the friendship  and nearly sacrificed everything for it.  i got nothing but my friend walking away and treating me like trash-  the fact is there is nothing you can do and in time lets hope the hurt passes for you and i both|`|9d20b0d4d57fd02b80ab1bb8c1dd88a9aa	i have the same problem. i give and dont get half back. its good to care about people and you shouldnt stop. You should, however, be aware of how it is effecting you. You are important too. If you are caring about someone and they, in turn, are making you feel bad, by ignoring or not caring... Maybe you need to evaluate who you are caring about. There's no one more important in you life then you. (Unless you have children)|`|jzcHiGz6aa	don't expect same from other..<br>  you cant change other...<br>  just wait for other the time will come when they understand you and come after you when they will have to survive with bad people....|`|QUKc25Fcaa	do wat i do......ignore them|`|ggujeOL5aa	first of all, you should never want anybody in your life that don't show you they want you in theirs. What i mean is you can care about someone so badly and if they don't feel the same way, it's not really considered a true friendship. I think you should be strong and talk to this person or people who you feel aren't putting effort into your relationship. If that doesn't work, you might have to let go. You deserve people who care about you in your life just as much as you care about them. So try talking to them, and if they show they don't care even more... it might just be time to let go. Just remember, you always have people that do care about you and you can always start fresh in a friendship or relationship, people come and go. <br>  <br>  Keep your head up and good luck. I hope it goes well and that they realize your way too important to lose.|`|AajHgvS7aa	Welcome to the club! it is very hurtful but u need to learn not to give your all to these people, i think you should treat them the way they treat you.
QD2n4xXFaa	u know what? u react to how u want to react, if he apoligized... take it in to consideration, but if it happens again, break it off, be strong, dont suck up!;p|`|4EWCegiRaa	That's 10 years ago (a WHOLE decade!), you're involved with someone new, and it was only a crush....  Just move on!|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	You both have moved beyond your 10 year ago crush.  It is always nice to run into to old acquaintances--because 10 years later that is what he is-a mere acquaintance.  What kind of reaction did you want from him when you sent him a "normal" hi?  If you were truly happy in your current relationship you would not be initiating conversation with an old crush.  Don't read into something that isn't there, he is apologizing, which is what mature grown people do, it is what it is, that's it.
lwXGNizGaa	Dude, don't be that guy, you know nobody likes that guy.  Just let this whole thing go.  Definitely do not go around telling everyone, especially the boyfriend, unless you want to look like a jerk.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Be a good friend and leave it alone, you definitely went over the bounds.|`|wqL84O8Naa	are you still drunk??<br>  she has a boyfriend and clearly she's a tramp...why would you want anything to do with her?|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	i think you should just let it go if she has a boyfriend don't mess with her realtionship.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	This would make you that guy....and her that girl.

I would talk to her, see what you can remember with both your fragmented memories.<br>  <br>  You should also probably tell your friend and apologize if you're a real friend, but that will take some real courage.  Good luck.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	She probably didn't want to mention the couch because her bf was in the room.<br>  You don't need to ask her if you overstepped your bounds because you definitely did.|`|MiC6j7Huaa	Don't ask. If she is still with him, she clearly just wants to forget about that night, if she breaks up with him then you can ask...
IXskJPlVaa	You two are separating for 3/4 years - better leave it now, keep it for later. That way it will be easy for both of you in case something happens to either of you in this period, otherwise after these 3/4 years - physical relations will be an added bonus which you two will be eagerly waiting for. It will be worth the wait. Best of luck.|`|ev33OxJbaa	Just respect her wishes. You cannot force someone who is not ready. If you rush it and lets say she gets pregnant.. you both do not need that right now. Emotionally she is not ready and it would be wrong for you to seduce her.  She is not ready, so do not have sex with her.|`|UBS4jIAcaa	whoa! perhaps you should ask this question(whatever the hell it is) in your first language?<br>  <br>  unless you really are using forks in the bedroom? in which case your a loon!|`|2gP8ZGnSaa	Why you are seeming like more as a LUSTER not as a LOVER.<br>  <br>  Sry, I don't want to hurt you.<br>  <br>  But Physical involvement should be done after both side approval.<br>  You should not force to do this.<br>  It is a very special act for a girl to get physical.<br>  <br>  You guys are seperating for 3-4 years and really I believe its not a time to get physical with each other.<br>  <br>  I agree that in Love, excitement to get physical with your partner is a normal thing but you should respect her feelings and asking ways to seduce her is a wrong thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of LUCK|`|5bwk17nsaa	well if you are going to separate after 3/4 years then she is in her full right to save herself for someone more permanent!<br>  otherwise..just get married.to show YOUR commitment to her.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	lollllllllll,,,,wats fork play by the way? on a serious note..if ur gf isnt ready or sure for something....DO NOT force her into anything!!!!|`|7mfYyQ7Paa	Do not force people into a sexual relationship ever.

GeruGGOQaa	Why are you both independently wealthy?  Do you both own a large amount of property?  Pre-nups usually only cover wealth obtained prior to the marriage.  Anything you accumulate during the marriage is considered joint property of the marriage and therefor not protected.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Call a lawyer.<br>  <br>  If you can't figure that out, are you really smart enough to get married?|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Go to a lawyer and get it done legally. Make sure you both have all your demands written down, so you know what to put in it, but do not get married without one. People will say if you need a prenup you shouldn't get married, but the odds are about 55 percent that you won't make it, so cover your bases.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	You both pony up a lawyer (one to protect each of you), hash out the details & sign it.  You can also skip the lawyers, download a pre-nup package from the web, hash out the details (on your own), and than have it notorized (both sign it in front of a witness).<br>  <br>  I don't think you file it with the Courts etc., you just keep a copy in a safe place.  As to tailoring it, you can do so to an extent but keep in mind that if you enter into the absurd / silly a Judge might not consider the pre-nup valid (and he will toss it out). Also keep in mind that you can't pre-nup out of paying child support (if kids are born of the union) and a few other things).<br>  <br>  All in all, its simply not worth the hassle unless one or both spouses have significant assets PRIOR to the marriage (because once you are married anything else automatically is a marital asset).|`|c55O7jqXaa	If you were really that wealthy- both of you or one of you before marriage then you would know to call a lawyer and you wouldn't care how much it cost or be asking how much it costs. Of course you can set what you want, but whatever you aquire during marriage is both of yours. <br>  <br>  The only reason for a prenup is if you are so wealthy like millions.|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	you have to speak with a lawyer. i'm pretty sure you can have it say whatever you want.
eGpOIV12aa	do guys lose confidence when girls keep declining?<br>  <br>  most guys do keep their confidence after getting rejected a few times, but they learn not to keep banging their heads against a closed door.<br>  a guy only gets rejected so many times before he moves onto the next woman.
zCE0slQ5aa	this may be true with younger, less confident men.<br>  no matter what, however; if you treat a man like he is the most important or 'only' man in the room,...he will exude confidence which is unparalleled and infinitely strengthened by your support of him.<br>  <br>  you have the power and influence to make him the "tallest person" in any given room or situation.<br>  <br>  be a responsible, true woman. nourish this gift, don't abuse the power.

I really really like my close friend and people say that we sould go out but he's never said anything and I just want to know how he feels....so frustrating isn't it?! <br>  You can always ease into it when it's just you two and you're not talking about anything. Maybe something like "My friend says that we look like we're going out! (Even if they didn't, get get a friend to play along incase he checks up) Do you think it looks like we're together?"<br>  And then maybe say "Have you ever thought about it?" or something like that....it's so damn scary though!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)|`|I7OZ4glFaa	if he your best friend then u should be able to talk to him... just sit him down one day and talk to him about it u cant be afraid of being hurt or rejected that just comes with it and u never know he might just like u back but nevere knew it but if he doesn't like u like that yall can still laugh at this n forget it... i mean its going to be hard but u will be ok and yall will be ok cause one lit thing like  that won't change yall friendship|`|VD4NQMLLaa	A girl that tells me she likes me gets all my attention.<br>  My recommendation is: tell him.<br>  The only thing that could happens is that he says: NO.<br>  I can live with a no. But not with not knowing.|`|sKCxxdNBaa	just be bubbly you known bubbly is the why you say how you feel  about hem (be good now)|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	just tell him how you rfeel|`|pjggSVKKaa	wat eva u do dont take them out for a meal go 4 a walk or something oh actually u should text her the day before and say i have to tell you something 2mor dat i just cant say over text!<br>  if she avoids you at school u know she doesnt wana hear it she obviously knows its serious and she knows what it is then she doesnt like you!<br>  if she talks to you and asks ohhh wat did u wana tell me and she wil play dumb like she hasnt a clue wats goin on but girls know everything just tell her u dont wana make this wierd and loose your friendship over it and if she doesnt feel the same then you will respect her decision and move on but that you have developed feelings for her also tell her you love being friends with her and that it may take some time 4 u 2 feel not embarrassed but it doesnt mean that u dont wana be friends u just need some time and thats for if she says no!<br>  <br>  oh im so excited for u good luck!! <br>  <br>  if you have bebo and want to tell me how it goes its JohnR3286|`|zY7boFYNaa	It should be not any awkwardness you should tell how you feel, you know, I know it kind of sucks the feeling, but since it's your best friend you should just be upfront about it, and not worry a lot.|`|oB1WQJHgaa	randomly be like omg this is why I like you! when he does something you like... make it a not weird thing to say....like light hearted. :) hope i helped. if he does not get it... keep saying it randomly till he asks or comments. :)|`|63GLryA3aa	hey there.i am leaning towards just leaving it alone.friends can be more important than lovers.flap your lashes at him.rub your boobs on his arm on purpose.if he doesn't bite after a couple of those,quit while your ahead.|`|UDGBrOqaaa	Confess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	Tell him!!

AND THINK WE SHOULD BE MORE|`|RAtShC83aa	You have two options: <br>  1.  Follow him around everywhere he goes and make it "look" as if you are trying to be inconspicuous (i.e. hide behind things when he turns around, but not quickly enough that he actually misses you)<br>  <br>  2.  Buy a bunch of alcohol, get him drunk, and then sex him.|`|xSrVaaChaa	I fell in love with my best guy friend as well... So just randomly ask him, do you like me as more than just friends? and see what he says... <br>  I am now dating him and things are going wonderfully..I hope the same for you!|`|JXs4BsTXaa	give it a rose and hope that she likes red ones.|`|YkKQoRfcaa	hurry up and tell her your like her or shes going to find someone else to ****|`|4PK0hiWeaa	He's leaving so act fast.  Just tell him, he probably harbors feelings for you as well.
7e4jxj3Daa	Good for you and your beliefs, but don't shove them down other peoples throats. It's all a personal choice.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	i find it alright. i mean i wouldnt be able to wait till im 20-25, if i ever get married!|`|vPjbSBhJaa	Just out of curiosity, I would like to know the bible quotes that forbid sex before marriage. Ever had a ham sandwich? That's forbidden for sure.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I think it is a shame that many people wind up committing a lifetime to a partner with whom they are incompatible sexually or infertile together.<br>  <br>  "Don't do that, It's nasty" "You want me to put my mouth where?" "Don't look at me with the lights on." "That position is dirty" "Why don't you take the time to give me an orgasm?" <br>  <br>  Just few of the things for you to think about.|`|333W9jeCaa	I have so much respect for you as a teenager enforcing what the Word (Bible) says. Sex was meant to be something sacred and shared between only 2 ppl (husband & wife) after they are married. No matter what others tell you, stay close to the Bible & don't let anyone pull you away from God. He will bless you abundantly for holding to it & not giving in to temptations & worldly desires. God bless.|`|Lsz5Nqw7aa	it's good that u have ur beliefs... personally i believe it's okay to have sex before marriage, because sex is a certain connection and i think it makes sense to make sure that connection is there... but i would never force my beliefs on someone else!! :)|`|ME5oMRJdaa	no i don't think it's okay or right. Society has made it okay which is really sad, but If you wait, you will be WAYYY more blessed in your marriage|`|nHeTLBzyaa	YESS!! lool i find it soo stupid that people have to wait to have sex until they r married!!!<br>  I mean what if u wanted sex, u wud hav 2 get married to do so haha!!<br>  Sex is only good if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend and you really love eachother!! then its a good way to express ur feelins for eachother!<br>  But the worst thing to do is sleep around and have sex wiv random ppl!!!|`|S3bbOKvcaa	nothin is wrong in this world....  go for love  if it is safe n secured
n8rrXke1aa	There must be a reason as to why you won't to move school so talk to her about why you won't to move, hear here out, see what she thinks and what other ideas she has, remember to listen as it shows you are rational and have more chance of getting your own way. Then continue to show responsibility and don't keep asking or nagging, yelling or so on as she will just be more likely to say definitely no, so  just keep bringing it up now and again so she knows you are more serious about it
xwsS0ITJaa	nice ***|`|fFnfFROQaa	Perhaps she had other things on her mind and your compliment had interrupted her. Takes some time for some people to let it sink in, especially when they are busy.<br>  <br>  Next time, if you really want to make a better impression, wait until she takes a break or lunch, so her mind isn't on the job at the time you see her.|`|07L1TwNraa	Maybe she didn't hear you. Did you mumble or were there otherwise distractions? Because I can't think of a time where "you have nice eyes" didn't go over well. <br>  <br>  Maybe she just didn't expect it. If she seems cool with it I'd say you're good.
KNBTViNNaa	DO NOT GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE! People do not change. If he likes her body that much, trust me every time he picks up his child he'll be thinking about her body not yours. That's never going to become a healthy relationship. You may have never in your life had a connection to someone like him, but that's just because you haven't met the right guy yet. Each relationship is different each new man will bring a new connection and normally, each new connection will be stronger than the last. Get out there and meet some new men. It will help you to get over this looser.|`|cfFlf1EAaa	Follow your heart do whats best. Don't let a relationhip stress you out. Education is more important than worrying about an unfaithful guy. I would say don't give into him so easily. Make him suffer a little while. I don't mean KILL him. I mean ignore his phone calls, dont call him, dont go see him at all for a while. Make him miss you a lot. Be Strong sister dont let these guys use you.|`|DskwNSPPaa	if he loved you he would have no need to go else where so i think if you love someone you should let them go! he observably was not thinking of you while having sex with this other woman was he? as he IVas or they wouldnt have been texting like that!|`|g5p3mB0haa	well..... its happened to me and i got bk with my bf and its worked out ever since if u feel like u want him bk go for it just make it clear u dont want a cheater in ur life|`|b1MTFlWJaa	if you feel like you can handle it then go for it|`|AA11644166	move on.. he's just going to do it again.. you can count on it.|`|FteB0LOraa	No! One strike and you are out. If they really loved you, they would not have cheated.|`|YkKQoRfcaa	dump the ***** if she cheated on you|`|hqtOKXThaa	As a general rule No , but people do make mistakes and forgiving people is solely up to the person who was hurt. I would never try to convince a person who was cheated on to drop the relationship because he might be the right guy but the relationships always have hurdles. Sometimes we meet people we the right ones and the wrong time of there life and they need to grow up a bit more but things like this can help you grow as a person.|`|QHx95iZDaa	In my opinion I would not be with him.I think you should dump him because he knew that he was with you and that he loves you but he still went and talked to his ex like that. Now that is just not right. And deep inside you know that there is a chance it may happen ones more. You are not his first choice if he said that he wanted her body and to be with her. I will tell you that you should have someone that does not want to be with anyone else but you not even for 1 minute. So dump him and go find a man that is good to you. Hope this helps you if not than there isn't much I can tell you.   <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  {Julia} :-)|`|4cWtH7X2aa	The trust is gone and it's not going to come back. The healthiest thing for you to do is get on with your life. You will never be fully content with this man, you will always be wondering in the back of your mind what he's up to, or if he's being truthful.<br>  <br>  He wrecked this. Forget about him.|`|wqL84O8Naa	its one thing to get drunk and screw up, its another thing to be texting and begging for somebody to come back to you...<br>  <br>  you're his second choice, if you can live with that, go back to him|`|fVMzCP5raa	No! <br>  Once a cheater always a cheater|`|QUCIdBp5aa	Nope.  He has a kid elsewhere which means he's always roamed and always will.<br>  <br>  Don't you think you deserve better? ;)|`|AA11755944	it is likely he will cheat again.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	If you really believe they regret it, and you still love them, I don't think there is a reason not to give somebody a second chance.  However they only get a SECOND chance, not a third or fourth or fifth because then you're just letting yourself be a victim over and over again.|`|GG2bxCd1aa	Ahh..I am in a similar situation. I too find it very difficult cauz I still love him.If you feel like, we can exchange ids and and chat sometime. Not sure but guess people with similar situation can relate and help each other move on.|`|AA11506593	Once a cheater, ALWAYS a cheater. <br>  <br>  And relationships without trust can NEVER work.|`|3g3DgQZgaa	I would consider it if he would go to couples counciling.|`|etA9BX5gaa	no.|`|uF8RLL4laa	no|`|Di6FAQxRaa	If you love this guy and he loves you and he is truly sorry then let go of the past. tHE PAST SHOULD DETERMINE YOUR FUTURE, BUT IF HE'S TELLING THIS TO SOMEONE HE HAS A CHILD WITH THEN HE OBVIOUSLY STILL HAS FEELINGS FOR HER ESPECIALLY IF HE WANTS PICS OF HER. i PERSONALLY WOULDN'T FORGIVE HIM, BUT IF HE IS TRULY SORRY AND hes not gonna do it again  then forgive him. You shouldn't dwell in the past, but if you can forgive him in your heart and mind then do it. But can you trust him again, if you cant don't look back keep moving forward. There will always be someone better who wouldn't disrespect you so think about that also. If he cared he would have did what he did, especially with someone who's gonna be in his life for a long, long time. keep me posted , good luck.......Move on in my opinion but you have to decide if you can trust him again and leave the past where it is.|`|fAN8snFdaa	I did.. for 3 years.. then left him.. he still aint over the break up 10 years later !! <br>  I wish i'd left him immediately.. but hey .. sometimes love is blind !<br>  <br>  It's a hard one to answer.. perhaps just have a month apart and see how you feel.. if he really loves you he will let you have time to get over the hurt and pain he caused you !<br>  If you still feel sooo strongly for him, then you could give him a 2nd chance.. we are all only human (?)
zCE0slQ5aa	ask him this the next time you have a 4-hour phone conversation...<br>  <br>  "What would your girlfriend say if she knew you were on the phone with me at this time of night?"<br>  <br>  if he says,..."I don't have a girlfriend."<br>  <br>  than you say,... "Good, i guess she won't mind than."<br>  <br>  if he says,..."She wouldn't like it at all." or anything else indicating that he does have a girlfriend...than you can say..."Well if she knew, and knew me, she would know that im harmless."<br>  <br>  if you are laughing or giggling when he is making jokes and cracks on you, and he continues to do it than he likes you and this is his way of  stalling to think of more interesting things to talk about. if his cracks are making you uneasy or if you don't like them and he continues to do it than that is a negative, so make sure that it doesn't bother you.<br>  <br>  if he doesn't have a girlfriend and you like him and feel comfortable, ask him out.<br>  <br>  guys don't talk on the phone for 4 hours with girls they don't "like". :)
76gXl5Zcaa	soo talk to this guy.. life is 2 short to have regrets.
XUKSqkVdaa	technically you won't be a virgin on your wedding night but yes i do think that you should wait. It is safer for a lot of reasons that i am sure you know.|`|V6U0sZEVaa	no, sex is a huge part of a relationship. I don't know if you have particular beliefs holding you back, but when sex is loving it enhances the whole depth of feeling between you. Judaeo Christian teachings on the subject are derived from the rules of a people who had extremely hit and miss ideas of contraception 2000 years ago. Think about it: sex before marriage meant illegitimate children. that's it. it was a practical rule that got morphed into a spiritual injunction. Of course make sure you are careful! Good luck.|`|BWem1nJOaa	Well if you already done it 3 times then your not really saving yourself for after marriage you already kinda broke that barrier|`|C2GhDHciaa	wt*freaking*f<br>  why wuld u wait???? if you done it already<br>  <br>  im sorry but ur question is really dumb lol.<br>  .<br>  <br>  well the story changes if he wants you to wait, or ur partner wants to wait, but still ur question makes no sense|`|djUMvICoaa	At least wait for Mr. Right and don't fall for every Mr. Right Now.   If you can do that you won't go wrong.|`|ygAkXSknaa	íf you decided to buy a car - wouldn't you want to take it for a test drive?|`|cLPimVR6aa	If you done it already what is the point of waiting?|`|KEUFaCkUaa	you sound like my wife.  i'm a virgin even though i sucked 24 d*cks.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	So you have been married three times?  Or you have had sex three times and now want to wait?  I guess whatever you decide is fine.  Although your fiance may wander what he did to now not get sex before the upcoming marriage.|`|QSodlfMraa	that is up to you, but i would love to know who is home boy in bed.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Having a sexual urge is a natural phenomena. Trying to curb a natural force is not healthy. As long as you practice safe sex and guard yourself against the various sexually transmitted diseases, you do not need to wait till you are married.|`|I814g6ZBaa	If that's what you want to do then: YES!!<br>  Just because you did something a couple times doesn't mean you have to repeat the behavior anymore, Honey.<br>  Zip it up.  Save it for Mr. Wonderful.  :)<br>  Best to you!!!<br>  xoxoxoxo|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	If a man respects you he will respect your decision to wait until marriage.  Chalk up those 3 times to being young and dumb.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Kind of late now, isn't it?|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	I'm often wrong, and may be again but to me your question gives the impression you didn't enjoy sex. If there was pain or you didn't reach orgasm, you should see your doctor. You don't want to go into a marriage with these type of problems.<br>  <br>  If it's just a matter of morals, you can wait for marriage, but  you may not be able to keep a prospective husband without sex in your courtship. If you never had sex before, that's much different, but you can't pass a used part as new, and have him think you're a virgin.  <br>  <br>  Personally my view is that sex is a healthy expression of love to an already loving relationship.If you find "Mr. Right" and your dating relationship turns to true love you may want to reconsider your options.<br>  <br>  You don't state your age so I'm just assuming you are of legal age and marriage minded. If this is not the case, disregard my advise.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|04Te5gzzaa	That's what you would call becoming a born-again virgin.  If your fiance is up for it, then why not.  It will make everything else leading up to the wedding night so much more fun.  You can do everything but sexual intercourse.|`|yb01tlviaa	hahahaahahahahhahahaha what?  if youve done it 3 times why not 4, or 5?  I dont understand why you would all of a sudden want to wait?|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Only three times?  Why, you're still half a virgin!  LOL!<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter now, all you are doing is working on crowd control at this point.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	ha ha ha is this a trick question???  i don't understand why you should wait since you already did it!!! lmaowrotf... are you trying to claim your virginity again? lol|`|AA11506593	If you've already had sex 3 times, then your question is moot.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	You have already spread your legs.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	I think you are missing the whole point.
AA11508703	If you hit on a dude that isn't gay... your are probably going to get punched in the face. <br>  <br>  <br>  Gay people don't understand the testosterone rush from a gay person hitting on you... It really encites violence.|`|8d79a4e1999cf914bedfcbe3074786e0aa	hmmm can be a very complicated situation.<br>  <br>  Don't jump into anything if you aren't sure, try to find out about him see how he would respond to being approached in such a way, as some people can be very volatile to being liked by a person of the same sex.<br>  <br>  If you really like him... and you are sure that you like him in this way... ask your self (if you are not already 'out') do you want other people to know you are gay/bi are you ready for the type of attention you might receive (good/bad) if you do?<br>  <br>  It is a very big risk to take... in the end its up to you to decided what you should do.|`|DjRCYuLXaa	Unless you're sure this guy also likes boys I wouldn't just ask him out right away.  Instead get to know him.  Try to become close friends, and after a while if you really trust him tell him you like boys.  See how he reacts and if everything goes well then ask him out.|`|iWghWH6Taa	WELL THAT MEANS YOUR PROBALLY GAY AND THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IF YOUR  NOT ASHAMED OF IT.

Qk7xiIkNaa	You should save your marriage no matter what.  She will have to support herself  sometime.  If she has to sell and down size that's her decision but make it clear to your wife that your relationship comes first.  There are programs for widows that are provided by the gov. have her see a seniors councilor about financial matters and get out of there.|`|vLFhGJuXaa	get couinseling with your wife (both of you go) move out|`|n8rrXke1aa	It is up to you of course and whatever anyone says must only be taken as advice because whatever you do you have to live with. <br>  <br>  My Nan is a great pain to my mum and dad since my grandad passed away; she is always phoning (every 10 minutes no exaggeration) as she is lonely then she comes round when she knows my mum and dad will be in. She always speaks her mind, and it was taking its toll and my mum and dad too so ultimately they decided that they had to put themselves first as it was their lives they were living, in your case I would say although you ought to respect your elders yourself comes first. <br>  <br>  Is it not possible for you both to move into smaller places of your own? where you could still support her, as she may gain money from the house prices difference?|`|ge7QGN9Zaa	She can get a roommate. There are lots of senior women who don't wish to live by themselves.
zCE0slQ5aa	if you are truly in love with someone the way love was intended,...you would never utter those remarks to them. you did it and now you regret it. there is no point in analyzing this. you are young, and this was your first experience with intimacy. intimacy is not love. it is powerful but it is not true love.<br>  <br>  true love would never speak those words and sentences.<br>  true love would never return those words and sentences.<br>  <br>  you care deeply and truly but you can't handle the emotions that are welling up inside you, can you? you are into something you are not prepared to handle. you need more time and life experience before you deal with intimacy let alone true love.|`|289DtjKVaa	**** that sounds pretty harsh, i think the best thing to do woulod be to send him an email or a message telling him that you said all that in anger and you were trying to hurt him, you didn't mean it and that you still care about him.. and that if he never wants to talk to you again you understand, but you want him to know that you think he is a great guy and all the stuff you said was meant to hurt him and you shouldn't have said it, 'if you want to forgive me i would like that' but if can't i understand'... and youll have to expect that...<br>  <br>  understanding his 'smoking' d;-) is ok, but you shouldn't be putting up with any cheating, if he cheats you should consider wether he is right for you,,, thanks for the help on my question our relationships do sound similar, smoking problems, breaking up,, blah blah, but i got a question for you.. she thinks that i hurt her, but now she has hurt me, and she is happy with this friends with extra's, im not i want a full time girlfriend not a part time who doesn't call me.. any more advice for me
c55O7jqXaa	Sounds like your wife has an infection. She needs to get checked out with her gynecologist as this smell it not normal She also needs to clean up real well and use lubricant. You also need to stop having sex with her until this clears up and also get yourself checked out. You can be passing something back and forth. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend you not do a 3 way and it is weird that she would mention this. Are you sure she isn't cheating on you already and maybe caught some std? I would definately make sure you both be tested.|`|kbz5S3waaa	shower sex? Lube?|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	become a virgin again.|`|LbvRxf2jaa	That's  not nice "it hurts me"...do you even have a wife or just wanted to write that?<br>  <br>  Many women when they're tired/stressed can't get wet.  Maybe you or something else in her life is tiring/stressing her out.  Use lube.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Regular bathing.  They do make lubricants, and other fun products.  The three way suggestion is a little strange, and could change your marriage forever.  Think this one through long and hard.|`|nFW8QeBsaa	She probably has an infection, after 12 years you sould be able to tell her to go get checked...|`|PPBIPEedaa	The best thing 4 you 2 do is sit down and have a serious talk with her because something serious could be going on with her.  Has this been going on the whole time? If it has she maybe need to start taking better care of her famine hygiene, suggest nor forms or a douche.I think its also something out here now to restore natural juices in a woman.
GBr9YngTaa	He is frustrated that there is a language barrier. If you really like him and he loves you it'll work out if you wait. Be supportive of him by asking him if he needs your help he can come to you, keep in touch and ask if he wanted to go out and study or ask him how his school is going. He'll appreciate it.|`|AA11596133	Learning a new language is NOT easy - and it takes a lot of TIME and effort - of which he obviously is not wanting to do right now. <br>  <br>  LEAVE HIM ALONE.

If you live in the present, high school will be irrelevant.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	Real life and high school are not even close to the same.<br>  <br>  I found school very boring, could not sit still and concentrate. I had a lot of friends and a few very good friends.<br>  <br>  Here is my best advise - get the best education you can so you can get a great job or go on to college.<br>  <br>  College and high school are two different worlds. Everyone should give it a try.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't go on to college, high school is about as far from real life as you can get. once you graduate you are responsible for yourself - you don't have as much time to worry about things sucking so much. You are too busy working to support yourself,lol|`|Cv2h6n1Raa	I'm sure it will effect you for the better. High School just sucks for some people. You have been going to school with the same people ypur whole life, and I'm sure all the clicks transfered over from middle schjool. you will have a blast in college, trust me, there will be a ton of people who like you and they will be all new and different. Those who are cool in high school usually peak in high school. The most popular people in my hs are now a bunch of has been losers.|`|h9O9k5wwaa	Let me start by saying my high school years (i graduated in late 1980's) was NOT good by any means.  I did have some friends, but not many and I really didnt care that much for school.  Some bullies gave me a hard time, and while I did have one or two boyfriends, i wouldnt say I loved high school.  As a matter of fact, I just plain hated it.  From the work, to the teachers, and the cliques...it wasnt for me.<br>  <br>  Now many many years later, my life is great and has been since graduating.  I have everything I have ever wanted...a wonderful husbands, great kids, a house, etc.  High school is just four years and it goes by quick.  It really does.  it will NOT affect your later life.  Finish high school, do good work, and move on with your life.  I hope this answered your question.  Good luck to you.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Everything you do will affect your life in some way or other, so yes.  The ideals you carry now will carry you into your future self, whether or not that person is a valued member of society or the scum of the planet depends on you.|`|ElyktlDgaa	haha im not a fortune teller but im going through the same thing. As long as you stick to your goals in life, not get into drugs or unhealthy situations, it takes times. maybe not now but you'll realize that its a process. just be friendly but not needy and keep a positive attitude. I'd choose quality instead of quantity because in the end u want a friend who will be there for you :)|`|pSjY9CXaaa	i hated high school too and i changed to one that is self-paced and has alot less ppl. we have less hours in a day and we teach ourselves.the teacher is only their for if we need help. i dont hate school any more and i can graduate faster if i want. maybe you should see if there is a school like this in your area.|`|1IIc7ZyQaa	probzz.|`|PzboDDI2aa	i thought school was for learning not for friends.
xoXkHOVsaa	You told him that you didn't want to talk to him, but since you caved in you are going to have to do it again.  Send him a final e-mail or call him on the phone. Let him know that it's over and you will be ignoring him.  He's going to be upset, but he will be just as upset if you just cut him off.  At least this way he has closure.|`|Qk7xiIkNaa	Be honest and tell him any way you can that it is over.  Then don't contact him again it is better to be up front then to keep him hanging on.  Make a decision and stick to it.

e9vcseLlaa	Hi lola. <br>  IM a model aged 14 and i have braces. They told me they looked cute if i picked the right colours so i have new ones every 3 months. I usually pick girly girl colours. But the once i had to have black and white. They'll like them|`|4EWCegiRaa	Do you know what turns men off?  Insecurity.  Rock those braces and men will respond to your confidence.  Freak out (like you are on this question) and they'll be turned off.|`|Exwgi9oBaa	I don't know much about modeling but braces on a teenager (maybe young adult) are definitely cute.|`|A0fZTWO0aa	Well i think so.  And the guys at my school dont care if girls have braces, they think its cool
BbWk7RNgaa	Okay, girl, you need to get a grip.  You think he's going to leave you if you don't have his child?  You should only have a child if you want one, not just for him.  Especially if yr not married!  Don't have sex with him if he's going to trip you out like that.  Dump him.  Get your own life, become independent, and then find a man who cares what you want.<br>  <br>  I know it can be hard if you love somebody, but just because you love him doesn't mean he loves you, that he's good for you.  If he's a good guy, talk to him, tell him yr situation, tell him what you want and what you look forward to.  Plan a life with him.  If you try that and he's not a good guy, he'll show it, then you'll know, and you can move on.<br>  <br>  And tell him, please, it's easy to tell when a guy's not wearing a condom, and he can't fool you, so don't try.  Or get on the pill so you don't have to rely on his questionable judgement.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	don,t have unprotected sex outside of marriage|`|AA11596133	QUIT HAVING SEX WITH ANY MAN WHO IS THIS SELFISH, PERIOD.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Dump him. He is a rat. <br>  <br>  No good person would take off the condom behind their partners back! <br>  <br>  That alone is enough insight into his character for me to know you should end this relationship.|`|w4EusdX3aa	Stop having sex with him, and dump him.|`|AA10500537	go on the pill til you;re sure <br>  don.t trust him|`|1TSMdgG1aa	First of all you need to look at yourself and what you want.  You may love him, but you need to love yourself first.  And that may mean having to let this guy go, even if it hurts.<br>  <br>  A guy that loves you will understand and respect your wishes to not have babies at this time.  And moreover, he would not pull off his condom!!!!  It just sounds like he's more interested in having a kid at whatever cost that in being a responsible man.  <br>  <br>  If you believe that having this baby is going to make the relationship ok, you're in for a surprise. It's unfair to bring a baby into this world just for the sake of keeping a relationship going.  A baby is a gift, not a fix. Please keep this in mind. <br>  <br>  You deserve better than that, and I hope that you believe this too and let him go.  You'll find a better man.|`|0VWPazrdaa	be careful, that happened to my friend and she's now 5 months old, she noticed he was taking the condom off and went in her and now she's pregnant, tell him you're not ready for it yet and if he dumps you for that then i dont think he respects that, if he does that that means he didnt want you he just wanted a kid|`|Yfb5c4r8aa	Neuter him<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  Do it|`|vLFhGJuXaa	ok so if he finishes with you because you refuse to have a child with him.  what stops him from dumping you after a baby is born, nothing.  go on the pill or stop having sex with the guy who just wants to have babies|`|dl5ZWzpGaa	If he truly loves you he wouldn't leave you.  He obviously does not respect you or your decisions.  You need to really check your relationship with this man
5ajVBIN8aa	Trust your boyfriend. it's not easy... but remember, your boyfriend is still going out with you. he loves you not her. if he does, he will leave you for her.. so he loves you. trust him|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Do not try to stop her. The more you try the worse you will look. Instead believe in yourself. Tell yourself that you have some qualities that make you his gf and she has something that makes her his friend. Be yourself and stop competing with her. Let them be friends. You take the high road and try to be her friend too. Always remember that you are special because you are the gf and not her.|`|uwaAcgyiaa	Jealousy is a terrible thing.... " its like a seed that starts off small but will grow and grow till it is a tree of emotion"<br>  You have to nip it in the root, it seems that you feel insecure about him, and on your hold on him.<br>  If he just sees her as a friend then you should know this by the way their body language is towards each other, either its friendly or flirty, dont let your imagination get in the way, because it will make you see things that are just not there.<br>  Now if he is flirting them get rid of him, if she is flirting with him, then say to him that it makes you really uncomfortable... and how would he like if you were flirting with his friends.. he will understand then.<br>  So he will react different when he sees her, and his friend will pick it up.<br>  Dont be afraid to say it, but dont nag...... and make sure your right before you do anything, because if they are just good friends you may just lose him if you react un appropriatly.|`|ULLRoTsVaa	No don't be jealous, on the flip side. I have a couple guy friends that I have alot in common with, it doesn't mean I like them more. None of them hold a candle to my guy and they all know it. Do you talk to her at all? if not why no? You should ^_^ I think you could learn alot ^_^.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	To be honest, i don't think that people every over come being jealous!<br>  I mean, in some cases it might calm down when you feel like you're with the right person and you know and feel with in your heart that you're safe and you don't have to worry about anything!!!|`|PXN7r0RRaa	when u get jealous.. start runnin like ur forrest gum|`|8XT17ra1aa	Lol, i like Papi's answer.  Jealousy is a tough cookie.  EVERYONE can and will get a little jealous at some point in a relationship.  You cannot get crazy with it, though.  It can take control of your life, which will destroy your relationship.  Of course you can't say anything to her, that would be weird.  Do not assume that he is cheating on you.  Give your bf the benefit of doubt that he is just friends with her.|`|KNAaYprYaa	i have the same problem so i will tell you what i did - tried to make myself look way better than her. this was bad because then she tried harder when she realized and started flirting loads. <br>  <br>  my advice is not to try too hard and maybe try and tear them apart slowly by doing more stuff with him that maybe she doesn't like.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK :-)

Period.  Immerse yourself in other things, and when your mind drifts to him, force your thoughts away from him and to something pleasant.  I know this is really hard, especially at first.  It will get easier, and if you keep at it, this is the quickest way to get past it.|`|Siu5uiomaa	friends weather they're human or pet at least a pet will listen and they're always there to cuddle|`|YGAuamaraa	Call him your EX. boyfriend.|`|LVEh23MSaa	get distracted, e.g go out with friends<br>  rip up pictures of him.<br>  delete all texts from him.<br>  throw away/ give back all the items he gave you.<br>  don't listen to songs that remind you of him.<br>  restyle your hair? its what quite a few women do.<br>  Don't 'hang' where he does.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a bit.|`|Cv2h6n1Raa	Keep yourself busy, work a lot<br>  Spend time with your girl friends<br>  Develop a new crush (that way your thinking about him instead of the ex)<br>  Go work out, it helps to get the aggression out and you'll have a killer bod because of it.|`|cfFlf1EAaa	The best way is by getting another friend you can have more fun with.

Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep calling..one of these times ,he is probably going to answer the phone first...|`|m4T0IT0yaa	NEVER GIVE UP.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER.  Keep trying.  You will succeed.  Find different ways too...does he have an email address?  A cell phone you can text or call?  Send cards, send letters, etc.  Everything you can.  He needs to know that you still love him.|`|h55xWcyiaa	at age 13 he is allowed to make his own choice. I once was in that situation with my daughter... her father thought he was being very bright about the all thing but when she turned 13 she decided to come and live with me. Ever since she wants to have nothing to do with him. Little tip.. Whilst she was living with him (and I had absolutely no contact with her) I sent her a mobile phone for Christmas with my number saved to call me when she wanted. He took the phone away a few weeks after but all it did was to make her even madder at him and wants even more to contact me.|`|AA12252260	Don't ever give up on a relationship. You're his dad, so it's only reasonable that you'd want to talk with him. When you do get the opportunities to speak with him, stress how important he is to you. If you give up now, he'll grow up thinking either little of himself or of you or of both.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	if they took away your visitation rights it for more than being a stay at home dad.  something else is going on.  <br>  you should stop traumatizing your child.|`|nCFnFLCDaa	No, I think  you should talk to him.

When I really needed him he wasnt there and it has casued me to have a lot of issues with abandonment. I say you do what you can to see him and develop a bond now before its too late. I also have two brothers that went thru the same thing and my youngest brother is meeting our father for the first time coincendately today and he is 22 years old. He was very hurt and bitter and their relationship is very strained now. I think you should try now because one day it will resurface.

H3WHxCgaaa	Bring a friend and pick your child up - YOU put YOUR child into YOUR car.  Got it?  The friend can help bear witness (don't bring a girl...) and by you placing the child in your car you avoid dealing with her behind the scenes.  If it continues - do a neutral hand off via an impartial third party....(kind of celebrity like but instead of a nanny use a trusted family friend).

lPR2NZSZaa	Traditionally the grounds for divorce are; Adultery, Physical or Mental cruelty, abandonment, Separation for a Year and irreconcilable differences. Remember modernly, you don’t need the other party’s consent to get a divorce. You start by filing a petition/complaint for dissolution of marriage with your local court. Then other party has 30 days in which to respond/answer the petition/complaint. If the other party does not answer you get what is called a default judgment. If there is a response/answer you go to court. In some places couples who both consent to the divorce can enter into a stipulated judgment and submit it to finish the matter uncontested. You can usually only do this if you agree on all aspects of the divorce such as martial property, support, and custody. Some courts also allow you to get a divorce even if some issues are not in agreement. Some times it pays to get your divorce done by a Legal Document Preparer (LDP) and not a Lawyer.|`|Cpwedckvaa	Use the good old fashioned "irreconcilable differences"  Works every time!|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	It varies by state. You can file a no fault, which usually means you're siting irreconcilable differences or breakdown of the marriage. Or you can file a fault based divorce stating adultery, abandonment, abuse, etc. (these vary by state as well)<br>  If she consents, its considered an uncontested divorce. That is the best way to make it low cost and relatively fast.|`|62P5ouqOaa	why don't you cheat on her then you guarantee she'll want a divorce...of course if you innitiate the divorce you may end up giving a lot up to her in the divorce, and a judge can force you to go to counseling to see if you can work it out before actually granting you a divorce. have you really tried everything to make it work?

Shame on you for not using protection and bring another child into this miserable situation when you already knew what he was like. You are deluding yourself, and putting your children, in harm's way if you think you can change him. People don't change unless they want to.

You got fine written all over you.<br>  I'm invisible. (Really?) Can you see me? (Yes) How about tomorrow night?<br>  You can fall off a building, you can fall out a tree, but baby, the best way to fall is in love with me.<br>  I have never had a dream come true until the day that I met you.<br>  You look life my first wife! (how many have you had?) none.<br>  Do you have a sunburn, or are you always this hot?<br>  I'm addicted to yes, and I'm allergic to no. So what's it gonna be?<br>  If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.<br>  Turn to the girl sitting next to you at the bar and say... "I'm not really this tall....I'm sitting on my wallet."<br>  This is a test of the emergency pickup line service. Beeeeeeeeeep. If you had been any less beautiful, you would have just heard a bad pickup line.<br>  If this bar is a meat market, you must be the prime rib.<br>  I know I'm not a grocery item but I can tell when you're checking me out.<br>  If beauty were sunlight, you'd shine from a million light-years away.<br>  Do you mind if I hang out here until its safe back where I farted.<br>  Life without you would be like a broken pencil...pointless.<br>  Your body is a wonderland and i want to be Alice.<br>  I'm like chocolate pudding, I look like crap but im as sweet as can be.<br>  Can I have directions? ["To where?"] To your heart. <br>  Are you an alien? because you just abducted my heart.<br>  Did you fart, 'cause you blow me away! <br>  I hope there's a fireman around, cause you're smokin'!<br>  If you were a booger I'd pick you first.<br>  Excuse me, I think you have something in your eye. Nope, it's just a sparkle.<br>  You've been a bad girl/boy. Go to my room.<br>  If beauty were time, you'd be an eternity.<br>  Do you know karate? 'Cause your body is really kickin'.<br>  Are you as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside?<br>  Like the sheets on your bed I want cover you with love.<br>  Do you have a Bandaid? Because I just scraped my knee falling for you.<br>  Hi, I just wanted to give you the satisfaction of turning me down; go ahead say no.<br>  I hope your day is as radiant as your smile. <br>  You make me melt like hot fudge on a sundae.<br>  You know what? Your eyes are the same color as my Porsche.<br>  Are you an alien?, because you just abducted my heart.<br>  What has 142 teeth and holds back the incredible hulk? My zipper.<br>  I can tell your future, it is you giving me your number.<br>  Hi, I'm Mr. Right. Someone said you were looking for me. <br>  Giant polar bear (What?) It's an icebreaker. Hi, my name is....<br>  Your so hot when i look at you I get a tan <br>  I must be a snowflake, 'cuz I've fallen for you.<br>  You look so sweet your givin me a toothache.<br>  My love for you is like the universe...neverending!!<br>  If looks could kill you would be a weapon of mass destruction. <br>  You - "Did it hurt". The other person will naturally say "Did what hurt?", You - "When you fell from heaven."<br>  Excuse me, can you empty your pockets? I believe you have stolen my heart.<br>  Do you have a map? I just keep getting lost in your eyes!<br>  You say "I bet you $20 I can kiss you without using my lips." She says, "Bet's on." You kiss her then say, "I lost."<br>  You got something on your chest: my eyes<br>  Do you believe in the hereafter? Well, then I guess you know what I'm here after.<br>  I don't know if you're beautiful or not, I haven't gotten past your eyes yet.<br>  What does it feel like to be the most beautiful girl in this room? <br>  Your eyes are as blue as my toilet water at home.<br>  I'm not drunk, I'm just intoxicated by you.<br>  Do you want to make millions? millions of babies! <br>  The night is young, the moon is bright, and you are here with me tonight. <br>  I wanna bag you like some groceries.<br>  kiss me if I am wrong, but isn't your name (take a guess)...Janice????<br>  Are you from Tennessee? Cause you're the only TEN I see|`|8XT17ra1aa	Approach the girl (in my case), and say: "hey, my friend over there wants to know if you think i'm cute?".

RN1wGlWWaa	Some fantasies are not to be reality.  I feel that its wrong to bring in a 3rd party into your marriage.  If she wants it as a fantasy and does not want to make it real, then you have to respect that and not try to make it real.<br>  <br>  Let it stay as your fantasy emails, etc.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Voyeur, technically. Pervert use to mean someone that wants sex with children, now it means anything else other than what you do.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	There is a film with this concept<br>  --You know that you can write E  mail messages to me  through this section by clicking the word e mail by opening  my  profile|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Your a voyeur my good man.

Something like this is best kept as a fantasy.  We all have fantasies and most of them should be kept just as that - fantasies.  You very well might find that the guy or girl she's on top of will be better than you in bed.  You'll be awfully sorry you tried to make this fantasy a reality then.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you are a pervert and a voyeur, with cuckold fantasies.  But, you're not as unique as you seem to think.  However, I believe you should listen to your wife.  If she's telling you that making it come true could have bad consequences, you should pay heed.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I love it when Happy starts talking cuckold.<br>  <br>  You are a voyeur, and while it is perfectly normal to fantasize, very few people actually act it out, and of those people, very few have a lasting marriage.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Everyones morals are different.  To many you will be considered a pervert.  To some you will be considered a voyeur.  To a very few you will be considered normal.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	A bit of both, but that's ok.<br>  <br>  I've watched a number of women bouncing on top of my hubby and he's watched me.  We are pretty open about such things.|`|41skve2Yaa	I think both.|`|ISAuCHNDaa	crazy8eddie is wrong pervert has never meant to want to have sexual relations unless you count the modern usage of the word to describe unusual sexual predilection as including among the various others paedophilia.  Pervert has always meant "to turn someone aside from a right religious belief to a false or erroneous one," from O.Fr. pervertir, from L. pervertere "corrupt, turn the wrong way, turn about," from per- "away" + vertere "to turn."  <br>  <br>  Aside from that you have an unusual sexual peccadillo and wish to act it out or more correctly have it acted out for your enjoyment.  This is not something to be ashamed of as long as you realise that the reality of a swap situation may not be as amazing as you'd hoped.|`|WVcUweTEaa	Hey if she can put up with this...then good for her.<br>  <br>  The fact that you havn't pushed her away boggles my mind!  However, at least it's her you want to experience a wild time for your viewing/listening pleasure ONLY.  From what I can tell, you are more into her physical pleasure then your own and would not cheat on her.<br>  <br>  Tone it down on begging her to do this.  If she REALLY wanted to she would have.  The fact that she has to make this stuff up for your sexual gratification is wearing her down and although I'm sure she loves you, in turn if you continue to push you may drive her out of your arms and life for good.  <br>  <br>  Seriously....tone it down.<br>  <br>  I'd say your kinky!|`|2S2onP86aa	You want your wife to have sex or just be on top of a lover, and it's even okay for you if it were with another guy.

DlUHlampaa	Girls LOVE movies just start conversation about the recent movie you watched in theater of course after asking her how was your day? what is your fav food/sport ..... and then ask her what kind of movies she likes if  she says " well, i like Comedy and Romance" then you are heading the game and then tell her that there is a new movie coming this week would you be interested to watch or what ever you wanna say it and I'm 90% sure she will say yes and thats how you gonna take her out.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	start with simple questions like:<br>  <br>  what kind of music do you like?<br>  who's your favorite band?<br>  whats your favorite food?<br>  Whats your favorite sport to play? to watch?<br>  <br>  Something like that is easy to relate to and the conversation will just flow from there. If you spark and interest in one another, you won't have to work at the conversation part of it. Good luck!|`|RZKygoPzaa	it comes down to details.  What do you know about her personally?  What are her interests?  Her hobbies?  What music doe she like?<br>  <br>  You will have to find this out.  If you are talking about girls in general, then I think you know they are into the latest styles, music, but remember, all girls are not all alike.  Are you like every other guy you know?  I expect not, but you do share common interests with your sex.  its the same with girls.  Formulate a plan, write a script and rehears it.  Its sort of like improvisational theater.  You have to be prepared to wing it, if you are not prepared then retreat and come back another time.|`|6b2ed66d1deeb6d5b77496a168089f4aaa	Talk about school, teachers, music. Dont talk about anything girly, we know when u are faking it. People you both know, or something around you like the weather how hot/cold or its going to be. You can ask her about her phone, or talk about yours etc. Or a topic that everybody knows where you live. Nothing personal at all. Stay away from judging anybody or anyhing, make her talk, let her be the one talking, all you gotta do is start the conversation, most of us girls like to talk a lot. Once you gets us talking your next question is going to be "how do i keep girls quiet?????|`|TrEYixLXaa	Okay, you can ask her things like:<br>  <br>  <br>  So, what's your favorite movie?<br>  <br>  What kind of music do you like?<br>  <br>  When's your birthday?<br>  <br>  Mainly I would suggest starting the conversation with how was your day?  and a conversation should spark from there.|`|D3XQ5DoSaa	Ask her questions that arent yes or no questions, ask her about things that interest her, we love talking about ourselves. If you ask yes or  no questions you get your answer and thats it. Engage her|`|tpn7iR48aa	spit or swallow?|`|mqTEGbCYaa	Let see you can tried aking her for help in a hw problem and and she dosent know you start by saying how you have problems in that class and you can also ask her if she thinks one of her classes is hard.  after you are taking about how hard the class is you can sujest a study date and afterwards maybe a movie.<br>   and if she able to help you can tell her how smart she is. You can said Thanks .Your not just pretty but smart. It worked for me when my 1st bf in high school did it. Get her talk about herself and pay attention. Ask questions like what your favorite class. Ask her about her hubbies. Like if she likes to go running , you can suggest you guys can run together, same if she like to swim you can suggest going swimming together. Or if you find out she like something specific but dosent know how to do it you can suggest taking classes together.My bf of back them found out i like the piano but i dont know how to play it so he  told me  "ohh we can make a date and i can teach you once a week. Everything i just said it what my bf that i had in high school did so i can go out with him . That was 4 years ago. Unfourtually we went to different colleges. So we neutrally decided to break up.|`|AfGJdYrxaa	well, if your going to talk to a girl, you should know a little about her, like things she likes, that kind of stuff. then you should ask her general questions like what has she been up to or what are you going to do over the weekend, you will slowly get to know her better and better and more confident with her and you should know pretty fast if she likes you.|`|qxm3zx2Zaa	Ask what she likes to do, where she likes to go to eat, what she wants to do in life, what types of music she listens to, what types of things interest her, does she work, if yes, where? <br>  <br>  That should be good for starters. Once you get to know her, it will be much easier to carry a conversation. :)|`|qdZlHsrdaa	always always ask her for her opinions. which mean, ur questions must have answers that is related to her, or anything about her.<br>  <br>  be the man. lead thru the convos. dun get stucked! keep on opening new questions or try to ask questions from the answers that she just gave u.<br>  <br>  and, teased her around. make her smile, laugh, smile again. once she start hitting ur arm, poking u and telling u ure full of bull while laughing, ure up one stage.<br>  <br>  take it one stage at a time. continue teasing and making her smile.<br>  <br>  ps: caution for hot babes, u must NOT be scared to approach them. best of all, u nid to overcome any fear of rejection in a very very confident and cool way. those babes always want to see u crash and burn, but u need to stand strong and show her ure not the type to be messed around with.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|1mJajydiaa	If u really want to have a talk with a girl try to pick up one form ur class ask her for notes u missed. While returning then praise her good writing even if it's not. Ask for some discussion on topic . This is so easy and then step up forward as ur mind says. Good luck|`|GEy1yN8waa	Ask them what they like, what they like doing and keep a faint smile and take her for a walk around the park|`|CkvbPXS4aa	Can I have sex with you?
m4T0IT0yaa	Sounds to me like you've got a good self-analysis already started.  That's half the battle, honey.  How many people never even look hard in the mirror and think something might be wrong with them and they way they deal with people.  Maybe get some counseling?  Or if you cannot afford that, then definitely get some good books on healing from divorce.  It's a traumatic experience and so many of us downplay it.  And then wonder why our relationships afterwards are all messed up.  Not every man is going to be just like your exhusband but building trust and relationships after divorce are hard.  Start some reading and continue realizing your feelings.  Talk with a trusted girlfriend.  Your sister sounds too negative to me.  Who needs more of that?  Good luck?|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate is the way of the Eva side.<br>  <br>  I have a list Im working on called the Axis of Eva, unless you'd like to be on it someday, you need to confront why you have all these problems. Did your ex-husband do something? Or maybe something from someone else? Whatever it is, you need to understand and manage it before you alienate every man on the planet.|`|ygAkXSknaa	I think that you are doing the right thing. When you find one with BS that's worth putting up with, you will stick around.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	My sister is in a similar situation that you have described. I tell her until you can let go of what your ex did to you and realize that not all men are like that and let go of that (knowing its going to take time) then you'll always look at the guys all the same way and there will always be a problem. I tell her that one day all the things that happened in the past will stay in the past and you have moved on.  You need to have trust in yourself before you can have trust in anyone else. Meaning that you have to trust that the past is the past and not all men are like your ex.|`|V6U0sZEVaa	I think this is probably pretty normal but it is something that is making you unhappy so my advice is to go and see a relationship counsellor. They are usually not too expensive as long as you can wait a few weeks for your first session and it may be that your work has a service attached (check up on that). I went to one and even though the relationship I was worried about collapsed anyway, i found it really helped me to get inside how I deal with things and why. It is so different from talking to a friend and even though I cried during sessions I always came out feeling real relief.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Maybe your just not ready for a long term commitment right now.. I found myself doing that awhile back before i met my husband if I was with a guy i would FIND things about him i didnt like so I could just feel guilt free about breaking up with him =/ Pretty shallow huh?? But when you meet the right person then you wont have to do that anymore and you'll feel "right" patience... Remember there are billions of men on the earth... WHY settle for someone just "average" to you?? good luck hun..
653j6x9maa	man, i went through the same thing you are.<br>  honestly, when the guy i liked got his heartbroken, i laughed for like 20 mins, i spent hours crying over him liking her, but when the sIut broke his heart, i couldnt help but laugh. i was happy, and i thought to myself. HOW DOES IT FEEL? hahahahahahaah it was great.<br>  so i relise you dont want him to be hurt, but maybe its best that he does, so he can see that someone like you, who wouldnt hurt him, would be better for him<br>  goodluck|`|FdGBJdU9aa	After calling this girl a **** and a whore and your petty jealously doesn't speak well of you either.  I think Jack should drop Sara and have nothing to do with you either. I think Jack can do better with me.|`|LykjWv6faa	You sure she's really a ****? Or is it your jealously that's getting the best of you?|`|pjggSVKKaa	ok ammm u cant do much wat eva u do ull turn out as being the bad guy maby he wont fal for her maby he just wants a ride and the reason hes with her is cos he wants to get his hole!! <br>  <br>  u cant do anything u cud try but it wont end up to be good!! <br>  <br>  and ya guys do|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	he'll come to his senses someday everyone gets hurt at one point or another so just let it be, <br>  <br>  be his friend, it looks like he'll need it|`|SorcFv62aa	he knows she's a whore but wants sex|`|C2GNAmMMaa	Simply put, there isn't much you can do. Jack has made his bed despite your warnings.<br>  <br>  I think Sarah might be toying with you, or else why would she inform you of her intentions?<br>  <br>  I suggest you be careful and try not to get caught up in something here. that way Jack can see how sane you are and always value you.|`|17DxV6SVaa	Okay, 1). you can't make him change his mind. He's male. 2). This girl may act like that for attention. 3). Let him go or tell him how you feel. You can't have it both ways. You need to tell him about this now, seriously. He MAY feel the same way. you never know.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|uuX7fXnhaa	as it seems.. he's intrsted in gettin laid down wid dat gal..as most guys are..         i think, u shudn't be wasting tym on him coz i'm sure its gonna hurt yu sooner o later.. so, i wud say.. MOVE ON.. sm bettr guys r waitin for yu gal..~!!|`|Z9llKxssaa	Clearly, you need to get a bigger bra size and be much looser.  If "Sarah" is such a whore with big nummy breast-ises, then of course he will go for her.  FIX IT.|`|2P5ZYuIvaa	I dont get why guys do that. It's really annoying. I mean really. <br>  I really think you should tell "Jack" about "Sarah." or just tell "Jack" you like him,|`|ABzyerQfaa	just tell him how you feel!!! you obviously didnt make it clear to him just HOW easy she is. of course u have to see what they are like when they are together, does she make him genuinely happy? are u sure she still feels the same way as before, because she may have grown to like him. but if you dont see any of these signs and your sure you wont be breaking up a happy couple then just TELL HIM, and warn her again that she said she was gunna let him down gently. not lead him on, tell her straight girl! good luck (: x
LxfqUaaIaa	Your boyfriend has trust issues you both should work through together. Too much aggression is his fault but you weren't right for trying to get back at him in that way ^^;;|`|hkwBR1moaa	While it is childish of him to tell some guy to leave you alone, it is totally illegal to hack into someones accounts (yes, even something as simple as facebook).  I would be ticked off if I were your boyfriend.  I might even break up with you.  Respect someone else's privacy.  Now apoligize to him and you should apoligize to the other girl.|`|NTUr0t3haa	Both of you are 100% wrong. You seem to be aware that your behavior was egregious so hopefully you have learned not to ever do it in future.|`|hLHP5OvKaa	I think both of you were wrong.  He should trust you and has no right to tell your friend to leave you alone.  But you didn't have a the right to go onto his Facebook and delete some of his friends.  If you didn't like it when he did it to you, why would you do it to him?  If he doesn't trust you maybe you shouldn't be in the relationship.  Or you could work on communicating with each other better but if you can't trust each other your relationship can't go anywhere.|`|tOB8pBguaa	UM.... seems pretty kiddish to me! He shouldn't had got mad cause your gonna talk to other guys and he is also gonna talk to other girls n if you dnt no that then yall aint gonna make it FAR!!  he wasn't right at all unless you was flirting with your friend!
f5FmJRfIaa	You need to get a job and get something to do with yourself instead of living your life through him.  <br>  Ok, well that's another matter, that's grief you need to work out, not just boyfriend stuff.  Mentioning your losses shows you do know what is the matter with you, that's not how it sounded when you wrote the first part.  When you say that you refuse to take pills because  you can get past this on your own, that suggests that family members have suggested you should see a therapist for this depression.  If this has been going on for more than a couple of weeks, like more like months, then it isn't something you're pulling out of.  If you really want to be a stronger person, find the strength to admit you have a problem and get treatment for it.  Sorry to hear about your losses...|`|gkE7vVbCaa	I can understand. I have the same feelings when i cant even talk to my man for hours. Its like Im so codependent.  I need constant reassurance. Maybe your not as bad, but everyone tells me to try and just stay busy.  I do take anxiety pills and they really do help.|`|KasFZL7laa	well i would say at least go to a therapist to talk about it.  they may help you realize why it is you feel that way and help you overcome it.  just be upfront that you don't want to take any medicine for this problem.
eTBfsjCUaa	I will marry you!!!|`|RZKygoPzaa	I'd say you have to calm down and not be so anxious.  People give off signals and at times a scent of desperation.  As in the animal world, predators can smell fear.<br>  <br>  Look for don't make it something like a hunter looking for prey.  It creeps people (not just females, all people) out.<br>  <br>  Get some new interests, join some clubs with activities you like, so that if you meet someone where, it is likely they will share some of your interests.  Expand your horizons, and become more of an interesting person.  Focus on something else for a while, whatever you are doing apparently it is not working.  So like someone going back to school for more skills, you too need to acquire more skills, more interests.  Education and intellect is a powerful aphrodisiac.|`|AA11506593	What qualities are you looking for in a woman? Where are you looking?

That is if you want one....Could be you don't and this is a trick question..I don't know.|`|AA10495394	well just find a relationship first and if everything goes well then you will get married.<br>  <br>  Answer my question<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At51xBrQ9gXj1vt3cn5L87bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309090806AAkFsKG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|w4kdTalPaa	Probably because your looking for one. Get a girl friend first.|`|zhk8o514aa	Wrong way of looking at women bub.
FXINmF6saa	You got to give it time. Trust me the right girl will come to you once she finds the inner you. You probably don't want any of those material girls that won't be with you because your not cute, those girls aren't worth your time ans money. they will never care nor appreciate who you are or what you do for them. You need to be patient and wait for just the right girl because that's when relationships last. If you just want a girl to seem like your a "man" that can get a girl then you aren't such a nice guy. But if you really want a special girl who cares for you as well as you will care for her then wait and she will come to you. There's no need to go out searching for what you might have right in front of your face.|`|TrEYixLXaa	Maybe you should stop looking for love and let love find you.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	maybe ur immature and ur not MAN enough. but most likely its cus ur going for the wrong girls|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	its kind of hard to guess why on yahoo!answers...|`|955qCxI9aa	Those sunglasses.|`|PU3ynPsdaa	its because your not great lookin,a bit immature sometimes and your too nice.|`|YKl4t7vZaa	A year really isn't that long to be single for. You'll find someone eventually|`|htWw0OlCaa	You said you act immature, so that may be the reason. But who knows? You also said that you are a caring and a nice guy. Sounds good to me...|`|nAK82h6vaa	Maybe your trying to hard to find someone,Just be yourself someone will come along and like you for who you are.
Qu7GIg6Haa	Most family law attorneys will give you a free consultation. Call around and talk with a few, pick the one you like. Many of your questions can be answered at that time. Also I would recommend that you do as much internet research on your state's laws regarding divorce and the process. I wish you luck!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	You don't need his permission. The courts will grant you a divorce with or w/out his consent. <br>  Its called a contested divorce. Contact a lawyer.|`|ca7542594b89a18dd875dc5253650b82aa	sounds like he is trying to work it out. But you do not want to. So file for divorce and get it over with. Yes! it hurts him but he will discover a new freedom and lots of nice women in the world.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Where do you live?  Why cant you just leave him?
Ok4lJYVYaa	No men are stupid and need your feelings spelling out to them! They do the treat them mean game too, and that's why when you are keen they are less so. This game needs to be stopped on both sides!|`|etXYn0sCaa	Up to a point thats true, then we just get bored and leave yu to get screwed over by whatever moron alpha male you've got yourself wrapped up in. We live in an age where its ok for men to talk frankly to each other about what bothers them, next generation online gaming, and high def pornography. Once you learn to cook and use a washing machine, girlfriends just seem like an unnecessary ball ache. There will always be those moron blokes that chase women around, and I'm more than happy to leave them to it...|`|37oVYYS3aa	The only advice i'd give is to look them in the eye and then judge your response. <br>   If you give off conflicting signals, then that's what you'll get back.<br>  If you like the look of them, tell them - be upfront - be honest. But don't then let them give you the run around. If you make it clear what you expect - it's much easier to get the most out of the relationship. <br>  If it's only a bit of fun you're after, then be as mysterious as you want. Challenge them about what they're after. <br>  Have fun and they'll either join you or soon let you know otherwise.<br>  for me - it's all in the eyes....|`|4kjIsqpnaa	The best thing to do is just be yourself and take things slow.<br>  <br>  Really it depends on the guy, if he does not appreciate you giving him 100% then he is not worth it <br>  <br>  Most guys just want a woman to be into them and not talk or look at other guys. Same as women. You want that person to really care :-)<br>  <br>  If your man is acting up, tell him politely what is bothering you, if he does not listen and change his actions then he is not right for you. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :-)|`|S8RL9lieaa	Men aren't programmed to show emotion especially in public. Get them on their own and you'll see a different character emerge. Treating them mean will only last for a very short time before they loose interest, and move on.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I suppose if you like dysfunctional relationships, you might choose to treat the person you love badly.  NOT.<br>  <br>  What kind of messed up sh1t is this?  Treat a man mean to keep him keen?  Good grief.<br>  <br>  How about: Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you?|`|gxzJ4lxhaa	Be yourself and sooner or later you will meet the right man. By the way, have you heard this well known saying?, " A woman a dog and a walnut tree, the more you beat them the better they be".|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Yes it works every time as long as they are actually interested in you.  I wouldn't say "mean" but "evasive and polite".|`|4HoVVCenaa	Any kind of game playing will eventually lead to dissolution.|`|74aZAQmMaa	MEN want three things: FOOD, Sex, Silence. In other words, Feed me F&%k me, Shut the F&%k up. Thats it.
bjt4M3Icaa	Sure if you intend to be there for her for a very long time.  Just know that you will need to continue this relationship with the little girl even if you find someone else and have your own children.  I say this because this little girl considers you her father and if you up and disappear because you have a relationship it will hurt her very much.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Personally, I'd say no.  It will be confusing to the little girl in the long run.  You are not her father not did you adopt her.  What happens when you meet someone new who is the love of your life and your in this situation too?  Then what?  Do you give this jerk of an ex-girlfriend money to pay for things?  And until when?  What happens when you have children of your own?   You sound like you'd be a great dad one day.  You are not responsible for the unfortunately lives of other people.  I'm sorry to say that it's her mother's responsibility to take care of her and to pick up the pieces and to get her help when she needs it.  Not yours, honey.  That's just my opinion.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	If you love the little girl and she loves you, you should keep in touch if that's what you want.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	I hate to say this.. because I had a DEAD BEAT dad for my daughter and my husband has been taking care of her since she was pshhtt a baby!! and If we ever split (god forbid) he wouldnt ever let her go... BUT your situation is alot diffrent .. & that really sucks for you.. Cuz im sure you got pretty attached to that little girl.. geeze this really sucks.. Im sorry hun!! =( I HATE women that use children as pawns.. grrr.. WANT me to smack the ex?? CUZ I WILL lol... good luck and god bless.. Im sorry i cant be more help.. TOUGH situation!|`|KEUFaCkUaa	i think you oughta cut bait pal.  if she's a psycho lying b*tch, what makes you think she won't tell the cops you molested her kid and try to get money from you?|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	I agree with me.<br>  <br>  Wait a minute....|`|XUKSqkVdaa	i think that you should play the role if you love her like how you sound you love her. Think about how much a little girl needs a father in her life. I'm not saying that you need to be bound to the family like a real father. Her mother doesn't seem that fabulous and she needs some kind of role model in her life.
lfCmjZxtaa	I do it to my husbandslave too.<br>  He is cuckolded.<br>  He must watch while I have sex with another man.<br>  Afterwards he must clean the dick of the man that fucked me.<br>  <br>  Arzu|`|VbmKYJ89aa	Its perfectly normal......for losers......|`|2I5XqMDzaa	lol nice one|`|5F224cRzaa	Yeh i know many people who do that|`|558BFdfTaa	It happens quite often. If your happy have fun.
QzWHMGHJaa	you have to love yourself enough to walk away even if you still have feelings for the person, recognizing that their feelings for you aren't strong enough.  In other words, you don't take being treated badly by someone else, just because you love them, they have to love you back and I think that's what girls forget about!  If the guy loved you back, he wouldn't do things to hurt you!|`|653j6x9maa	shut up|`|t9htoO50aa	Forgiveness is not saying it is alright what the other person has done, but letting go of what they had done. Forgiveness in love is letting go of the hurt and moving on together into a time of healing together.|`|WRC0O6tqaa	as a good humen we should gorgive to one another all the time no limit ...|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Forgiveness if more for yourself than the person you are forgiving. And just because you forgive someone doesn't mean what they did is ok, it helps you move on to the healing stage. I lead a life of addiction years ago the hardest thing for me was to forgive myself for what I had done to myself & my family. But I was wasting too much energy on beating myself up knew I needed to use that energy on the future things I could still change. Forgiveness is necessary to release the bad so you can move on to the good. Good luck|`|I7OZ4glFaa	well you mostly got it down pact i know what we learned in church is not to look back on the bad things in the past because its a sin but the past is the past it should be let go and gone but forgiveness is sometimes easy and sometimes hard easy: when it was a stupid arguement or  something out of love or somethint to long to give up Hard: when someone really backstabbed u or a father that walked out on his kids when they were young and then try to be apart of their lives and thats hard so its different times of forgiving and also limits of forgivness|`|XtJqqcCtaa	you just wanted to say that little speech didn't you haha
pkGDpaddaa	It's fine to go out with him, as long as you don't have sex. That would be classified as Rape and he could go to prison.|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	not really it's fine <br>  <br>  don't listen to other people|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	sure is. its called statutory rape. even with consent of sexual relations its is still considered statutory rape until you are 18.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_r...</a>|`|EHVGbev6aa	No its not illegal! Its illegal to have sex with him. You can't help who you like and if your parents agree then i say go for it! Talk to him and talk to your parents. Age it just a number!|`|OKbVceZdaa	It's called Statutory rape|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	yup, he's smart, stay away from jailbait.|`|VDjHMNEMaa	yes, it is illegal for anyone over the age of 18<br>  to be dating or having sexual relations<br>  with anyone under the age of 18. <br>  <br>  there are some exceptions, <br>  like if the girl is 17 and the boy is 18<br>  or somewhere around those lines. <br>  <br>  but other then that, it is illegal.|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	Its illegal to have sexual relations, you can spend time together, even hold hands, hug, cuddle, but NO sex, I'm 19 and my gf is 16(almost 17) however, we have parent consent for us to see eachother, just, we're not sexual|`|W8XAUSTCaa	to my knowledge its only legal with the consent of your parents. You should ask you mom/dad/legal gaurdian about it. Have him get the okay from your parents. But, if he really wanted to be with you he would with out a doubt. Age is just a mere number...|`|HZsq6vY8aa	you are too young <br>  get a bf of 15-16 years old<br>  <br>  Why he don't ask you out:<br>  1. its probably illegal<br>  2. maybe he is a shamed to be seen in public or with his friends with you|`|iWghWH6Taa	YES IT IS AND HE IS SMART NOT TO ASK YOU OUT. IN MOST STATES THAT CONSIDER ILLEGAL TO DATE A MINOR AND HAVING SEX COULD GET HIM PUT IN JAIL.|`|SnWZusBIaa	Yeah he can get arrested for rape if you're underage, which you are.|`|VM2b7gq8aa	idk|`|uhZneNORaa	it sure is..|`|mRZ6Z1O3aa	It's illegal, yes. but, if he's seeing you and if you are doing things. Like kissing,going out to eat and maybe even having sex.. Whatever the case is,it's illegal BUT if he's doing any of those and not in a relationship with you,than that's illegal too, andd he's obviously messing with you and that's not very cool.|`|eA33xJmRaa	It is not illegal for you two to date.  As others have mentioned, it is illegal if you engage in sex.|`|QpeCYzX6aa	You can date whoever you want but if you have sex with him and people find out he'll be charged with statuatory rape since he's an adult and you're still a child.|`|FZMBJAMpaa	It's definitely not illegal, maybe he is just a bit shy?<br>  Good luck. :)|`|5UM2harlaa	No my sister was 15 and she Is dating a 18 year old and they have permission so if both ur parents know about It and ITs okay then go for It. =)|`|eeIzofPeaa	what state you live in?
JCdBSULraa	whatever you do, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO MATCH.COM (or its pseudonym chemistry.com) and especially do not give money to true.com, because they will do everything in their power to keep charging you against your will.<br>  <br>  For Match.com, while they show you tons of pictures of girls that you can email once you give them money, be well aware that less than 1% of the girls will actually be able to see and read your email, since only subscribers can read or send mail.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for serious relationships, and are open to long-distance relationships, eHarmony.com can be good investment (even though it's very expensive)<br>  <br>  otherwise, just stick to the free sites like okcupid.com and plentyoffish.com, there are more members there and they never ask for credit card info.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	I have been with my girlfriend for over nine years now. These sites work, but you have to be smart about it.<br>  <br>  1. Go on a lot of first dates and keep them short (coffee or a drink). Most will be disappointing.<br>  <br>  2. Be aggressive about sending emails to potential matches. I am with my girlfriend because I was one of the first people to write her after she joined. Within days, she had hundreds of messages.<br>  <br>  3. Be prepared for this to take a while. If you find someone for the long term in six months, you will be doing great.|`|TeBco1s7aa	no. invest in weed instead
7e4jxj3Daa	He's just trying to get a response out of you. You shouldn't let it bother you.|`|QSodlfMraa	this guy told me that once, i found him and it disturbing|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Your barely getting to know this guy and he tells you he is jerking off? He is a loser honey who is disrespecting you and  only looking to get laid.|`|LykjWv6faa	If it was someone I barely knew, I would think he was a pervert.|`|653j6x9maa	ew i hate when guys say that like who are you trying to impress nasty a s s pervert|`|ErmcT4uUaa	he must be pretty talented if he can do that and text at the same time.|`|HoFdhTf7aa	yeah, if y'all are already great friends... then he might like you... but be careful, cause that means he might just see you as a sexual object rather than seeing both the physical and the internal parts of you. Like instead of loving your personality and your smile, he just loves your boobs. See what i mean? Just proceed with caution.|`|ENCktJmtaa	That's weird. Clearly he thinks you're hot, but he's too open with his masturbation (whether it was a joke or not) considering you're not even dating. Ask him if he likes you. Otherwise you'll stay confused.|`|ZEitfScGaa	It means he is a pervert. Stay away.<br>  It basiaclly means he wants to have sex with you, nothing else. If he actually liked you he wouldn't be so forward.|`|SMRcJVneaa	He was probably joking but testing out the waters to see how you would react.|`|b1MTFlWJaa	Personally for me it ios not a turn on <br>  its ugh but idk|`|X6gz0qKLaa	obviously he likes you, or at least thinks you're hot|`|AA10015976	its his way of telling you he thinks you're hot lol
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	actually there is some merit to that.  Someone who habitually picks at their food and never tries anything new is usually very reserved in bed while the more adventurous folk in the dining room tend to be adventurous in the bedroom as well.<br>  <br>  In general, people who have an appreciation of sensual pleasures (as in the 5 senses--touch, taste, smell, hearing, sight) also have a great appreciation of sex.  So you could say the same thing about someone who is appreciative of different types of art or the outdoors or music.  Great passion and interest in life also flows over into the bedroom.
0tusTThyaa	Premarriage counseling should be in your future, no matter who the guy is. There is nothing wrong with putting in a little time in a marriage. You're still young...enjoy life! <br>  <br>  And are you prepared to be a MILITARY WIFE??? Its not easy. I am a Navy wife, and its not always easy. So think about that too.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	YOu accepted your first proposal after dating for 4 years. That's reasonable.<br>  <br>  You accepted your second proposal after dating 8 months.  That makes you a risk taker, and someone who is desperate to get married.<br>  <br>  Now, after 8 months with the new guy, you've been proposed to again.  Obviously, there's something about you that men want to take home to mother.  Instead of accepting, why not wait a bit to see if the relationship is any good?  8 months is hardly enough time, especially since you are only 20.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, you're all over the board.  How old are you now?  Of course there is nothing wrong with you.  These men asked you because you're obviously a good person with a kind heart.  Those are compliments!  Take being asked to get married as a positive sign for yourself.  Secondly, you're said "people won't take your relationships seriously?"  People as in who?  Who cares who doesn't take something seriously?  When you meet the man you should be married to, it will only matter to you and him.  That's all that matters.  Everyone else doesn't matter.  What you think of yourself matters.  If anyone else can sit there without fault and point a finger, I'd like to see it.  The right one will come along in time.  Just relax, enjoy your life, enjoy your career.  You have a ton to offer someone and it will happen.  In the meantime, you don't have to divulge every single episode of your life to every man who you date.  It's not their business.  You share what you're comfortable with.  Good luck.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	You are too young. Finish college and enjoy single life before settling down.|`|6b2ed66d1deeb6d5b77496a168089f4aaa	you have been through a lot of serious relationships for your age. I too have the same question. I meet men and they all want to seriously marry me within a month, then after a year or so things change. So, Im thinking about staying engaged longer about 2 years then make a decision.  " I too have a good head on my shoulders I should say" Im very disciplined and I think Im pretty. So, I really dont know, the answer to your question, all I can tell you is wait to get married, wait to move it together at least 6 months, if its possible. Man love to wait for a good thing.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	Umm - why the hell do you keep saying "yes" to all these lame proposals?<br>  <br>  I have been engaged twice in my life - my first husband, and my second husband.  My first I was married for 10 years, and I am still married to my second husband.<br>  <br>  You are the one who is jumping both feet to these relationships - moving in with people, getting serious -- slow down.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The problem is not that other people won't take your relationships seriously.  The problem is that you do not take relationships seriously.  Or, you do, but you are naive.  The second guy was the best example.  What in the world were you thinking when you said yes to a man with whom you were in a "dysfunctional" relationship?  So you're caring, that's great, but does it blind you to reality?  So you're nurturing, also great, but does that mean you don't hold your men accountable for their own behaviors?  You need to start looking at your life, your relationships, and your choices more soberly and realistically, for your sake, not just so other people will take you seriously!|`|IfFfBMjCaa	There's nothing wrong with you. Just relax and don't rush in to anything with the new guy. You're young...take some time for yourself. Travel, eat Oreos for dinner, whatever you want to do. Because you won't be able to be as free after you get married.|`|1IIc7ZyQaa	Camp Pendleton is chock full o' pedophilezzz. sssorrooo|`|AA10593529	Wait till your 26-27|`|KEUFaCkUaa	why should they take anything you do seriously?  you act like a floozy.|`|9ZZzEvBFaa	I dont think that there is anything wrong with you i just think that maybe deep down you really want to get married and so maybe you sending that signal, however it think that you should tell mr marine that you really want to wait to get married, you are still very young and i think that you need to be comfortable with yourself where you are in life before you get into another engagement, if he loves you he'll understand|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Well, sometimes that happens to people. One of my bfs asked me to marry him 4 months after dating him but i said no, and then i met my husb like 1 yr later and he proposed 3 weeks later we met and i said yes, obviously. Both proposals were b4 my 20's too. I guess it depends on the kind of person you are, idk.<br>  take as a compliment as one women said, b/c not any women gets asked that many times b4 their 20's BELIEVE ME. Some women have to beg for it.

She will be mad at first but if you let her know that you have no feelings toward him what so ever then she will eventually get over it.

See if she says anything at the end of the week...if not ask her again the next week. Or time u see her after this week. Making  decisions like this is hard for some people.

Not everyone has an answer right away..|`|AlMI8Zcdaa	She's probably just trying to think of how to react because she isn't sure yet. If it takes a long time and she doesn't mention anything, she probably just doesn't like you like that.|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	She already knows how you feel so, if she doesn't want to make a move then you move on to someone else.  You could still be friends with her.|`|VcAFnpk9aa	send her love notes daily until she replies, also try standing outside her window for hours on end in the nude.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	Buy her a tarantula.  Girls like tarantulas.|`|vweoheAvaa	Just wait it out. If it's meant to happen, it'll happen. If not, move on to someone else.|`|A0fZTWO0aa	just talk to her and hang out with her|`|lAqV1OmRaa	I'm sorry, but it sounds like she isn't interested the way you are. If she was, then she would have said something by now. However, it sounds like she wants to keep you as a friend. If you want to be sure of this, though, ask her again. She's being unfair by not letting you know her feelings. Talk with her.|`|Fue5b9wmaa	Did you ask her if she wanted to date, or did you say you liked her, they are two completely different things, if you only said you like her she won't make a move necessarily if you asked her to date then she should say yes or no..|`|qEfJvQBWaa	she probably doesn't like you = / <br>  no she probably thought of you as a friend and now that you brought that up on her she doesn't know what to do?<br>  just ask her who she likes again|`|tjLs8ntDaa	She sounds to me as if she doesn't have an interest in you.  Move on and DO NOT ASK AGAIN!<br>  <br>  Matt|`|8FMBV0oLaa	omg thats me too he likes me,i like him but were still kinda normal.but u should ask her out.sometimes the girl gets scared .so just ask her out to the movies or something like that =D good luck|`|VIF42i9Qaa	go home and beat ur meat
5UaVp256aa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting. The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking, and it's free.<br>  <br>  "It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you."|`|ycPz8K8jaa	You can't make anyone do anything that they don't want to do first.  You can let him know that it bothers you and that you care about his health, but you CANNOT make him quit.  That's his decision.|`|DtUy1IFmaa	You can't stop your friend.  We all have free will.  Just like you have decided not to smoke..he has decided to smoke (for now anyway).  You can tell him you don't like it and that its bad but nowadays everyone knows all the effects from smoke.  As you get older people are going to change and sometimes it involves acquiring habits (like smoking) that you may not really like.  If you want to stay friends with John your going to have to accept that he smokes now and hope that he stops eventually.  Smoking is a bad habit but it doesn't mean he's a bad friend.|`|zGNJGD4haa	Hello sk8ergir...!!!!!<br>  Well you can't make him stop he has to want to on his own. I have been smoking for years & yes it isn't good for me i know that,but i also know this I smoke mostly because i don't wont to start eating again like i use to. See !!!! I ate all of the time due to my nerves. Just do this if you want him still,care for him & about him plus love him too,stand right by his side & support him through this & everything else too.<br>  Love Pamela|`|uFUeLSAWaa	that's his problem that he wants to die early, not yours.
McQXDO5Gaa	she's beautiful! she reminds me a lot of my cousin lol but yes, she is pretty. i've always been jealous of my cousin|`|KPkLwdn1aa	I think she is pretty.  If she looks at this picture in 20 years she will definitely agree.|`|UtR6D3UZaa	i think she's pretty|`|aca02944dc89c1d05786b74bbf7917dcaa	shes alright in my opinion, she needs a tan though hahaha
i5xByO9naa	your in collage dude. your single go crazy bang and keep banging. bang everything that moves . point being just bang. or you could have a serious relationship. your choice.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	If you're curious as to what your age group has to offer, then you need to satisfy your curiosity, otherwise, it will always be there and always nag at you that you didn't give it a try.<br>  <br>  Besides if he's making up things like not trusting you so that he can feel free to go out and get laid, then you don't need him anyway.
NEWbh3Plaa	Friendship has no age limit.  I don't think you really have to approach someone about being friends, it just happens.  If you want to be friends then keep doing what you are doing.  Talking to her, hanging out, whatever.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Friends have no age limit ... try using the term "Mentor" .. it implies a respect for the attained wisdom one has acquired and your need to borrow some from time to time.....<br>  <br>  Just be you .. It will happen ....<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ECvEknqtaa	age does not matter at all. you could be a teenager but be friends with an adult. if she gives good advice and helps you, be friends. dont worry about age-it really doesnt matter.<br>  just dont go u know (loving her and stuff)|`|nWKWoJAQaa	Friends are friends, no matter what age they are.  As a child I had an 80 year old friend.  Mrs. Butterrick... we both were good for each other.  If you are happy around that person, let them know.  I'm sure she feels the same way you do, if you both smile.  Just continue to talk and share your daily life with her.  Bring a card next time you see her.  I still have the card Mrs. Butterrick gave me 30 years ago.  I cherish it.|`|GAbGgdQ4aa	No, not really.  I find it easier to have a friend who isn't in my grade, and, as a general rule, has friends who aren't in my grade.  It creates less problems.|`|mF11m7bTaa	no im 20 and older women are nicer|`|OKjYOr0xaa	Umm no.. first of all<br>  age does not matter because friendships are lifelongings<br>  <br>  im 19 and my best friend is 15.. we are both best friends. we are 4 years apart... when im 66 hell be 62... both old.. right..<br>  <br>  aslong as you really really think its friendship<br>  <br>  but to answer ur question you are not weird.... because i have a best friend who is 23 and his 4 years older than me.. me 19 and my two bffs are 15 and 23...<br>  <br>  nop age doesnt matter|`|LX83B86Paa	No. Only unless the individual is a teenager.
XiRUVJGYaa	he myt be gay but maybe he is also looking for comfort.. some guys are emotional and need support... why dont you talk to him and discuss both your views on homosexuallity and you myt find out some more. n dont take any of it as a joke... you might hurt him.. and he seems like a very affectionate person|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i think he likes you.<br>  i'm not just saying that but that is seriously not how a guy friend acts towards another guy<br>  i'd say he does like you but i really don't know what you should do about it, if that is going to be the next thing on your mind.<br>  good luck :)|`|YX1w2KTqaa	wow, ur friend sounds pretty homosexual lolol seriously.. thats not normal for a straight guy. so i thnk he is gay..
trxEyVRLaa	I can't answer that for sure because that may just be who he is - but I suggest talking it out with him explaining that you're straight and you're confused by his actions :) Good luck xx|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	If you are unhappy with it, simply tell him either it stops or you are dropping him as a friend.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	I don't know about love, but he's definitely trying to get in your pants and help you find your true identity.|`|AA10890466	he wants man love from you <br>  <br>  change your aftershave lol
j75g25zraa	Open communication is critical to a healthy relationship.  If the other guy lives far away, he may be a non-issue.  Maybe he's just a good friend, like you said, maybe she just likes the attention.  But it sounds like she returns your feelings, so I'd go for it, not make an issue of the other guy up front, but keep an eye on it.  Because realistically, until you make your romance with her officially exclusive, you don't really have the right to question her interactions with others.  Now once you get your love thing really going, you should openly question anything that doesn't look right.  Good luck!|`|5bl8pKkGaa	Ask her about it :]|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	dont worry about it <br>  <br>  mbe she will truelove love you, your over reacting|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	no don't ask her about him, and don't listen to the guy above me<br>  the other guy on her myspace is a few states away, why are you even worried about that? he lives in cyberspace while you are a real person!!<br>  ask her out soon if not now, because when you snooze you lose.|`|juK9Xyxzaa	I would ask her about it.  If she gets mad, then she probably likes him too, and you wouldn't want a split relationship.|`|2KDwEEj9aa	It's myspace, stop worrying about it.<br>  She's said that she likes YOU.<br>  and he lives ages away.<br>  stop worrying.|`|osj6pGzJaa	Get off Yahoo Answers and make your move, bro.  If this other guy makes his move first, you may lose out.  <br>  <br>  Gather your confidence and let her know what's up.....today!<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope it works out.|`|ml2FDYECaa	The whole myspace #1 spot made me laugh...just go for it. Ask her out, ask her to be your GF, and go from there. Life is too short to sweat the small stuff. You'll just get stronger, and build your confidence from this point on. It's always a win/win situation when it comes to love..."Love the one your with" and you'll be fine...GL|`|ZdlENZR6aa	i think its better to ask her before taking a decision, you have to get to know her feelings 100 percent, anyways good luck!!|`|UhZk09GDaa	I think you should just ask her about him first, but it might not be necessary since she said that she's ready.|`|IZdR8cMDaa	have a conversation with her.|`|C8SQS8t3aa	I dunno, I would take her word that she wants to be with you. I wouldnt worry about it too much.|`|SwbmA605aa	u should talk to her politely and everythin will be okay and tell her that these things r worrying u|`|r9yowD2Iaa	They could just be friends, if you're really worried just talk to her about it. I'm sure she likes you not him|`|LbJqU82waa	FORGET IT AND MOVE ON|`|ZobeHnRuaa	Until the both of you openly make your relationship exclusive, I wouldn't put too much worry behind it.  Who knows, maybe in conversation on your first date she might bring this person up and give you the insight you want on who he is.  Assuming she knows that you frequent her myspace page, she obviously isn't trying to "hide" this person from you or anyone else.|`|arrtdo93aa	Kind of a tricky situation..You said this guy lives far away so i really wouldnt worry about it TOO much, and she did say that she wants to be with you, so i say give it a shot.<br>  <br>  But if into the relationship you notice that she's still texting and talking to this guy, definitely question it.|`|mQQrITgVaa	since he lives so far away, he's probably just a good friend.<br>  and since shes doing this all on myspace, shes obviously not trying to hide anything or go behind your back when she talks to him, so hes probably just a good friend. but if you're worried about it, then just casually bring it up. like text her...oh im not your #1 anymore. that hurts deep down inside ;] and maybe she'll tell you about him.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	It sounds like she's confused too. I would ask her, risk her getting angry with you. If she does get angry, run away! If she doesn't and she explains that she wants to be with you, maybe give it a try. Be cautious though, while in a relationship, even online flirting is cheating.|`|XqcmZ7cDaa	Be straight up with. Talk to her in person, not via anything else. If she really is ready for a relationship with you, she will drop him. But be careful, she just be looking for a relationship in general, not just one with you. She could be one to play you!|`|jYi3eZkRaa	if it bothers you ... ASK... you can't go into a relationship with doubts so get everything straight before you start dating and if she does get mad she is not the right girl for you anyway.. she should be understanding about your concerns|`|C8fmKUBJaa	she is waiting for you to make a move, but she isn't going to wait forever, so make it now, before she moves on to this other guy|`|VIF42i9Qaa	beat ur meat you'll feel better and get over her|`|AA10750251	This is a perfect example of the degradation of communication in today's day and age.<br>  <br>  Nobody wants to just talk or communicate directly anymore. It's all IM and Facebook and Myspace.<br>  <br>  Call the girl. On the phone. Take her to Cold Stone Creamery or Starbucks or something. Leave the laptops and palm pilots and ipods and blackberrys at home and TALK. INTERACT. Find out what you like about her. What she likes about you. Ask what she has in mind for the two of you.<br>  <br>  You sound young. Learning to communicate properly NOW will help you forever.|`|lAqV1OmRaa	I say that you ask her out and began dating her. Myspace "top eight" or whatever always creates a lot of drama. Just be mature and ignore it. However, after awhile of dating her and this guy is still number one, and this hurts you, then ask her about it. Girls like it when guys show a little jealousy, it makes them feel important - just don't show TOO much or else that's a turnoff!
31bEAdVsaa	just buy her a nice red dress that look good on her...<br>  and with it give her a paper writing ur feeling on it inmost romantic way u can express urself...<br>  and ask her for a dinner...after that on her place and cook for her something|`|5bwk17nsaa	well the only other romantic thing left is to give her a b'day card with a condom stuck inside?|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	Gift her with unforgettable, worth , useful  memento:|`|an967apaaa	if she is not staying with her parents like in a hostel or something give her abirthday blash at 12:00 in the night by doing something with the cake or balloons etc and try to speak sweetly to her the whole day by saying that she is really gorgeous and telling that it was ur luck to get her etc<br>  and definitely a dinner and not with a flower but a good gift she will definitely be thrilled|`|Pbo8wN5uaa	how old is she? is she staying with her parents or in a hostel/ with roomies? is she a lil more on the romantic side? is she the one who finds happiness in lil things? is she into something rilly fussy or grand? give us a lil more info plz.|`|GZg0io3uaa	dude..she is gorgeous..has her own place..<br>  leave it..m pretty sure..der will b aroung 5 more guys asking d same question as u r doing..<br>  2 b honest..try 2 fugure out wat she likes d best..if she luvs music..a collection of romantic songs can do d trick...
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	No. Friends with benefits isn't necessarily bad but I think that kind of relationship with an ex is a really bad idea.  There is bound to be one of you who still has feelings for the other (in this case probably him)  and someone will get hurt.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	nope... just setting yourself up for a BAD situation. you both sound 2 young to try something that complex.|`|de268996207e2277009ae109383ebab5aa	the problem with friends with benefits is that eventually someone gets emotionally attached- and then hurt.... i mean its hard to explain, but it can get more compliccated than desired.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	By the way, friends with benefits means you have sex with that friend. Just so you know. <br>  <br>  It never ends well - someone always gets hurt. It's not a real relationship, it's playing games with someones emotions.<br>  <br>  You are not ready for the big relationship thing - there is nothing wrong with that. Instead, just date people. That's what all kids your age should be doing. That's how you learn about relationships.|`|YJH5YcjBaa	I say go for it, friends with benefits is better than having someone who your obligated to...but don't get soo serious, therres millions of hot babes out there so sometimes 1 is not enough, its all a game and one day you'll find your other half...but yeah DON'T sleep around......Good luck hun|`|CceiP7q5aa	is very bad, it will all end in tears, i have seen this happen many times with my friends..<br>  if you feel like you arent ready to commit, you should just wait until you are ready for a proper relationship..|`|RYVnRQ6qaa	Friends With Benefits, I am in a relationship with a girl we are also Friend with benefits. I dont care for it, but it keeps her sane. If you want that feeling of compassion when yall are alone. and a state of assurance to be fun and good friends in front of everyone without the physical stuff then i suggest it.|`|6219075649d0b96df629bfd46afe42d6aa	friends with benefits is a perfectly good thing, nothing wrong with it, if you like him still then you, sure do it. You just gotta know that you can also get hurt from this too, you might start to like him more and then see him do other things with other girls, just dont let it go to far.<br>  best of luck to ya!|`|6JLIMmWYaa	Friends with benefits are nice!  However, if you don't want to be with the guy, then don't do it.  FWB can keep you from moving on, especially if it's an ex that you still care about.  Took me 2years to get over my ex-g/f due to us still having sex, and her coming over all the time.  Eventually, i had to stop so i could actually have a healthy relationship with someone I really wanted to be with.|`|nFQjRrLyaa	Just be friends with no benefits because someone can end up seriously hurt. If you dated him and it wasn't exclusive I don't think he would have a say in your life. Just chose what you feel is right.|`|SnWZusBIaa	Friends with benefits isn't bad if both people want that. If one person wants an actual relationship and the other person doesn't, then it causes a lot of problems.|`|cXm6cLcpaa	Bad...
46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	I wouldn't jump that much to conclusion with that little info.

oharBqe9aa	You'll never learn to swim if you stay on the steps of the pool.  Someday you will have to go in deeper.  The water is never absolutly safe, but the rewards of the right relationship are grand.  I don't know anybody who got it right on there very first try.  You learn what your looking for form each experience, and hopefully you find the person that fits along the way.
NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!<br>  <br>  I have read your other questions, so I know that you are struggling with finding a way to pay for your wedding.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember is that this is YOUR "dream" (which can be altered)....not any of the vendors that you are dealing with.<br>  <br>  In reality, obviously you know, that florists, bakeries, ministers, etc. do not work for free....that is their business.  I DO sympathize with you, I really do.  But, it is YOU that needs to adjust....not the vendors.<br>  <br>  Yes, if you tell the bakery you need a wedding cake...it is going to cost more than a regular cake.  BUT...a wedding cake is different than a regular cake.....you get the point.  Likewise with a florist.  <br>  <br>  You CAN have the "wedding of your dreams" if you are willing to rethink just a bit.  You need to ask yourself what is the most important thing....obviously, it is getting married to your fiance.  OK....so that is a given.  Now, how to accomplish this?  You can still have family and friends present.  What about a church?  Then have a small get together after.  Or...can you be married in a park or other outdoor location?  I know you are not in the U.S., so maybe that is not possible where you live...I don't know.  But, there is always a way to make your wedding meaningful.  It doesn't need to cost a boatload of money.  That is the difference.  It is NOT the vendors, it is the brides and grooms that have made the bridal industry what it is today.  If couples stopped splurging on this and that...well, then the bridal industry would have to adjust.<br>  <br>  One beautiful wedding that I read about was a couple that was married at their home....they cleared everything out....brought in some chairs...had family and a few friends and served a light meal after.  All said and done it was only $1,000.  All that attended said it was one of their favorite weddings.  Remember that ALL you really need for a wedding is a bride, groom and someone to officiate it.  That is it!  All the rest is "fluff."<br>  <br>  Sorry, I am so long-winded.  I really AM trying to help.  Just wanting you to realize that a dream can still come true if you are willing to adjust it.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I had a dream wedding. It's just that the type of wedding that I considered a "dream" wedding doesn't fit into the traditional idea of a "dream" wedding. But different people have different dreams.<br>  <br>  Also, my dreams were flexible enough that a whole lot of stuff would have to go absolutely wrong for me to not enjoy myself. First and foremost, I wanted to share this day with my friends and family, and this was exactly what we did. I couldn't ask for more.|`|4lL34wJnaa	The wedding is going to be my dream wedding.  It's going to be lakeside and it will join my college sweetheart and I in matrimony.  It will be gorgeous.  I am very excited about it (even though my father keeps inviting more people and my mother is freaking out about how many people are on the guest list and yes my parents are still together!  LOL)  I'm very happy with how my wedding will be.<br>  <br>  The only disappointing aspect of the wedding is that I love to travel and my fiance just informed me that we may not be able to afford a honeymoon.  I have since researched and found some very inexpensive alternatives that we may be able to do, but I am still a little disappointed about not being able to afford my dream honeymoon!|`|8bTder08aa	My husband and I got married 31 years ago this May.  We were married in a Red Carpet Real Estate office, because that's where the Justice of the Peace worked full-time.  It was just me, my husband, the Justice of the Peace, and his secretary and assistant as witnesses.  We picked the date because it was the one day I had off work.  After the vows, husband and I went to Sambo's (think Dennys) for lunch, and that evening I went to work as usual and worked until 1:00 AM.  <br>  <br>  And you know what?  Even after 31 years, that all shines brightly in my memory and makes me smile, because it was the day the best man I've ever met and I became husband and wife together.  I love him as much today, maybe more, than I did that day, and every single day he shows me over and over again what a wonderful, remarkable man he is.  <br>  <br>  That's all you need for a dream wedding.  Just you and the person you love best.  If you've got that and you know it, you have EVERYTHING.  If you don't have that, all the designer gowns and $150-a-plate receptions, dozens and hundreds of flowers, stacks of gifts halfway to the ceiling, and honeymoons wherever aren't going to make any difference, you're not going to be happy.|`|6jZcr33paa	Right now what I'm secretly gutted about is catering. I want to use the reception venues catering but it would add an extra $1500 to the bill so my mom and fiance just said we can use this local bbq place for $400. I'm just sad that the guests won't be served from nice table wear and with higher class food. I'm acting like I'm okay with it though because I don't want to look like a complainer. I'm trying to get a lot more hours at work though so I can just get the money for the caterer I really want.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I think it depends on the DREAM wedding.  The more materialistic a dream wedding is, the more money it takes.  And well, vendors know that.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Try nto to stress to much,the prices can be shocking! Honestly? I am having my dream wedding: my fiance and me, in front of God and our families and friends, taking our vows in the church where we met. That's my dream, it's very simple. We basically built our wedding and reception around this shared vision. <br>  <br>  Any "specialty" item comes with a pricetag, you're right - a wedding, a baby, even specialty shoes and clothing. Try shopping outside of the wedding vendors, get prices before you mention the 'wedding' and make sure they honor them. It is very difficult to swallow what some places want to charge, but if you are willing to bargain and save, you can get what you want for a decent price. If you can't, you may have to alter your visions, which sucks but is reality. Remember to do whatever you can do yourself, but keep it classy - have a friend who's a chef do the food or cake. Hire a local photographer. Hire a college DJ. Do your own flowers wholesale. Make your BM dresses. Make your own veil. Borrow your mom's/sister's/cousin's shoes/jewelery/slip. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aipChC3haa	Yes it does exist, I'm having a dream wedding!<br>  I am having the dream wedding, and you can't just have one because its too expensive.<br>  A dream wedding costs serious $$$$$$$$<br>  A dream wedding for me:<br>  very big<br>  large guest list<br>  fabulous dress<br>  the man of my dreams<br>  all of my family<br>  all of my friends<br>  perfect catering<br>  everyone happy =)<br>  My dream wedding is costing me $35,000.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Yes I was very heart broken.  I tried to figure out anything even have it mid week but the site alone was far too expensive.  My "dream" wedding would have cost 20k but I refuse to do that.  We are spending 6k on our wedding and will still be just a beautiful but missing alot of the things that I really wanted.  But the thing I want the most is to marry my fiancee.  So in the long run those things pale in comparison.  Good luck.|`|6odO4PK0aa	I Know How you feel. even after your wedding they get you ! I went to have my Dress Cleaned and Preserved and They were Like Is it a wedding dress? and then they charged me Like $200 to clean it!<br>    But , really I did get almost everything i'd dreamed of and in the end, All that mattered was I had My Hubby , forever, The Man of my dreams. Good Luck!
b1WMcGQ0aa	umm..yeah... and, it DID happen to me.....we're no longer together.<br>  <br>  It's funny that the ones who tell it like it is or possibly can be get all of the thumbs down. It doesn't mean it WILL happen, but life isn't always a movie with a happy ending where we see someone who grew up in an abusive home turn out to be a life saver...sorry.... I was with this guy for 4 years, and he was definitely damaged from getting beat growing up, seeing his mom get brutally beaten, his brother, and sister, and he turned out to be VERY VIOLENT.<br>  <br>  <br>  this is not the case for everyone, obviously, but the question was asking what we would feel, not what do we think of your current situation. So, just because it happened to me, doesn't mean it will to you.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Not necessarily. Many times men raised in these types of circumstances will vow NEVER to repeat it and if anything will bend over backwards to be a perfect husband. In a few though, they will have the mindset of whatever worked for my parents will work for me. This mindset can usually be spotted very early on in a relationship, and the partner needs to realize that it will not change.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	My Son father beat him and me when he was younger we left 10yrs ago <br>  He turned out to be one of the nicest kindest young man,hard working very respect full and not a violent bone in his body<br>  When he was younger his biggest fear was he turn out just like his father but thankfully he learn everyone makes there own choices good bad it not like a gene that  you pass on|`|KAoNgzcFaa	How does he treat you and other people and animals? if he respects others then no i wouldn't worry;<br>  <br>  Never ceases to amaze me how other people here judge people on what hasn't happened lol  Don't make him pay for the sins of his father that is being a fruit cake|`|rlQOjyhbaa	well does he respect an care for his mom and you might need to worry not sure so many elements he may feel sorry for women cause of what happened to his mom or he may have anger issues an see it as a way to cope has he raised his fists or got real angry an scared ya if so leave now|`|uI4Dspi4aa	My husband grew up in an abusive family. He has never laid a hand on me. He vowed that he never would because he does not want to be like his father. And the minute he does, trust me, his azz is to the curb.|`|2bhMmlzHaa	Not at all usually men who grew up with a wife beater for a father were abused by the father thyself and hate their dads|`|ygAkXSknaa	How come his dad never beat him, just his mom and his brother?|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	No. But I would consider it a red flag and be extra careful of it while we were dating. Temper flare-ups, punching walls, threatening you, etc. are all things you should have been looking out for while you were dating. <br>  <br>  My husband grew up in a horrible abusive family (CPS was even called multiple times) and he is a very caring, loving husband and father. So don't assume that just because he was abused, he will abuse. But it's still smart to keep your eyes open.|`|t81MEJ82aa	It's not that simple. Not everyone who experiences one thing reacts the same way. If he has never laid a hand on you, and seems even tempered then you have no reason to worry. If you were scared, then you shouldn't have married him until you were convinced.
uHg9rVbWaa	girl i know how it feels.  I am 19 years old and I have moved 20 times.  its never easy to move.  I found that when I started taking control, and was more outgoing and stepped out of my bubble people started to gravitate to me.  I have a huge group now, and people I never imagined would be in my life are my best friends.  I have a great boyfriend, and that is all from stepping out of my bubble, and doing things I wasnt comfortable with.  I also would have a party and invite others so I could get to know them and I got invited to more parties that way.  Your not alone.  I cried everyday after school for about a year.  Everything will be okay, you just have to be willing to do anything possible to be happy.|`|kLjLJKBUaa	you need to stop blaming your surroundings for your life.  take control of your own life.  i bet theres a solid reason for you not having many friends, clearly its not the location you are in because you already tried that.<br>  <br>  what you need to do is learn how to make friends|`|azbt1xddaa	why don't you ask them to hangout instead of waiting to be asked.  or throw a party yourself and invite people.|`|GAbGgdQ4aa	Try and keep in touch with your old friends.

wZzVuq8Iaa	1-Understand the reason the person is cutting. Often the person has been abused or doesn't have good support and have no way to express themselves.<br>  <br>  2-Tell the person that you care and you want to help her. Sometimes talking to cutters about it can push them away, so choose your words carefully before approaching them.<br>  <br>  3-Try to divert the person's attention to something more enjoyable, such as a hobby or fun activity. Reading maybe? Writing? Reading really does help...I would give suggestions but that is not what your asking for.<br>  <br>  4-Know that these actions are not because she is a bad person, but because of feelings that are difficult to handle. Look at the her past issues to try to determine the reasons behind these feelings.<br>  <br>  5-Offer suggestions to better deal with those feelings. If she is cutting because of anger, have her to try screaming or running; if it is way of calming herself, suggest that she try deep-breathing exercises, yoga or journaling. If she just wants to feel something, try an alternative, such as holding a frozen ice pack or chewing a chili pepper; these activities will achieve the desired goal without causing harm.<br>  <br>  6-Encourage her to talk to someone about her feelings, such as a doctor, minister or family member. <br>  <br>  7- If nothing works, tell someone you trust such as your parents.<br>  <br>  Everyone has only one chance to live and they should live it to the best, not to the worst. Cutting can really affect someones life in a negative way. Stay with her and make her feel good about herself. See movies together, join yoga classes, maybe read together. be there for her. When you catch her doing it, don't say anything to her just grab whatever she is using to hurt herself and don't give it back, break it in front of her.The only thing you should say is that she is hurting you by doing this.<br>  <br>  Tell her your worried, tell her you care. Show her that there are other ways to relieve stress.<br>  <br>  If nobody helps her, she won't stop. <br>  <br>  Hope I Helped and Goodluck. <3|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	get her help|`|RYiSYJvTaa	This probly means she's depressed. Depression hurts badly. Once you start cutting yourself it can be hard to stop. A good thing to do is to let your parents know and let your friend talk to  a doctor. Not the kind you go for check ups but the kind that she can talk to and figure out what to do. There is also medication you can use that does not change howt heir mind works but helps them as in how stressed she gets or help so unstead of cutting herself she might beat up a pillow.|`|8SKjbMFwaa	It's not the worst thing you could do to yourself...the worst would be killing yourself. However, this is just as serious, so I would suggest talking to someone at school, maybe her parents, or someone else who knows her really well. You could also consider calling a hospital and ask what to do.|`|HmnAjfINaa	shes dong it because she is stressed out  try an find some other stress relieving way like yoga or reading a good book, just explain to her that cuttin youself doesnt do anyne any good and that you really care for her and that if she needs anythin at all for her to see you but explain that cuttin isnt the answer much love for you and your friend xx|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	You need to tell someone before she harms herself badly. One slip of the knife could be life-threatening. Tell someone who can do something like her parents or someone you trust.<br>  <br>  Hope all ends well.|`|QXWqxMJzaa	If it's being hidden from others and she doesn't flaunt it around then it's a unhealthy way to "cope" with things and she needs professional help. Even tho you're her friend you have to tell an adult or her parents who can get her to a psychiatrist. I know it will seem like you're betraying her, but it's for the best.If it's been going on for a long time, then it might have become an addiction. Something she might "need."  One way I stopped was to substitute the razor with a rubber band. Still not very healthy, but better than a razor. Plus, it will make the transition easier. I wish you the best of luck.|`|3CshXZB9aa	Tell her that you're worried about her, tell her that you really care about her, tell her that you know that it is a habit that is really hard to break, and that you want to help her stop. Also, ask her what is bothering her, and make sure she knows that she can always trust you.<br>  However...if this becomes a really big problem, or what is bothering her is something really dangerous, you might have to tell an adult. Make sure you don't get sucked into the sadness either, and talk to someone if you start feeling bad.<br>  Hope this helps. I used to be a cutter too, and I know that it's really hard to stop, but if the right person cares about you, it really helps. <br>  Be blessed!|`|1PWsr8X4aa	tell her that cutting doesn't resolve things, ask her if she feels better when she cuts herself, she might say 'yes' but she really means 'no'...so get her from there and tell her that you love her and you don't want to see her like that, most of all be there for her!|`|4m4NRJJ1aa	Well you really need to get her some help like a counselor, and you really need to tell her parents and probably your parents too, She might get mad now, but she'll thank you later. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|T6HTHXbcaa	why your friend is cutting for no reason?<br>  <br>  maybe her parents make her life heII?<br>  <br>  or maybe she has no boyfriend?<br>  <br>  <br>  i think you need to tell her parents about she cut herself|`|jtEycSCpaa	Call a doctor on her.|`|ctiBcktkaa	you need to tell someone, like her parents maybe. she needs professional help.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	go help him|`|6xoTZYpZaa	Ashley Cullen:<br>  Shut the hell up, this is not her responsibility she has parents.  If you want to do something good for her then back away from her.  You would be amazed at how well people are adapted to fixing their own problems.  You friend is cutting herself, you have no imput in that, she is doing it to herself and by herself.  If she wants friends then maybe she can give up the self-loathing because if she is not valuable to herself then you certainly are of no value to her.|`|GDiH3dUJaa	Cutting yourself makes the pain you're feeling come out, with the blood. That's probably what she's thinking.It just causes more pain, and nasty scars.My friend used to cut herself and she ended up having to go to the hospital because at one point she lost too much blood.You should tell her that not only is she causing herself more grief and pain, she's hurting the ones that care the most about her. The best thing for her to do is to find someone reliable and talk out her problems.|`|njjsYA0Haa	This may seem like the last thing that you want to do, but you have to tell someone!<br>  Be it your mom, your dad, a teacher, or a counselor!<br>  This is not ok!<br>  And don't stop until she stops!<br>  If this doesn't seem like an option tell her straight on that you don't want her to do this and why.<br>  Tell her that she's a good friend and that you can't let a good friend do that to herself.<br>  Even if she resents you or thinks your full of crap for saying something like this you have to keep pursuing, if you keep doing it she'll see that you're serious and that this is no laughing matter.<br>  Hope this helps,and that you two get through this!<br>  Good luck!|`|591ff3ca37a70650fe941703c5be16efaa	It is so hard to see a friend in pain, and I am sure you feel helpless.  Your friend has some severe physiological issues going on and she really needs help.  The best type of friend that you can be for her is the type of friend that would risk a friendship for her own good.  My suggestion is to go to a school counselor and report what is going on.  This is the surest way she will receive the help she really needs.  Do not talk about it to her and your friends, as it is a private issue, but believe it or not, she is screaming for help from you.  Best of luck.|`|EhtvDmVaaa	first of all, you have to help her through this. talking is not going to do enough. once you see that it gets really really serious. you need to tell someone. it doesnt matter if she told you not to tell anyone. because its either a promise, or her life.|`|M6Op1pK7aa	tell her that everything is gunna be okay!<br>  TELL HER YOU ONLY LIVE ONE LIFE!<br>  to stop waisting her time being upset and TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST! take her on an ADVENTURE! haha!<33 goodluck!|`|xxEBY6x6aa	there is ALWAYS a reason for someone to cut themselves..try to know whats going on wrong in her life and after that..try to help her solve it...and if she keeps on doing it..that person better go find a therapist..ASAP|`|53pargZ3aa	you need to tell someone before she really hurts herself<br>  she might be mad at you for ratting her out but she will forgive you in the future and you will be saving her life|`|bcSp87xEaa	talk to her and tell her to think about what shes doing. if that doesnt work out take her to a councelor.. if theyre your best friend theyd take your advice..trust me.x-D|`|ytp13pw4aa	talk to a guidence councler.|`|26tmsARFaa	Dull all her razors|`|V4NaOAS1aa	tell ur school guidance counselor|`|sDJbjrA0aa	not THE worst thing, i'm sure eating glass could b worse
d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	Be completely honest with both of them. <br>  Tell the girl you don't like that you're really sorry but you're into the other chick. Theres nothing you can do or say to stop the broken heart, it's going to happen no matter what you do. It always hurts when the person you like likes someone else. <br>  Then ask the girl you like out and see how it goes. If things work out well between you, just remember to have a bit of respect for the girl who missed out, don't rub it in her face or anything. And try to stay friends with her, even if she starts being mean. Try to keep in mind that she has just been hurt and may respond by acting like a ***** toward you and the other chick. <br>  The only thing to do in this sort of situation is just be as honest as possible with everyone involved and just remember that someone is going to get hurt so try to be a bit compassionate with them.|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	Wow, what a doozie.

Write out street, road, and the full state name and everything.<br>  <br>  If children are invited than you need to put that on the envelope.

Otherwise, how will they know who is invited to the wedding? If you had an inner envelope, that is where, you would ordinarily list all of the names of the invitees. Hope this helps and...Happy Wedding!!
EhfGorc9aa	Traditionally when this happens, friends, neighbors may help out with meals,  cook dinners for the family and bring them over ie casseroles, and do things that the mother may have done to help ease their pain, and transition even a small bit.  Nobody feels like cooking when they are distraught so a nice home cooked family meal would be appreciated now and then.  Perhaps you and YOUR mother could prepare something they might like to eat....even macaroni and cheese, beef stew, apple pie, whatever for the family, and to help the Dad, and your friend and her little brothers cope.  Otherwise, just be there for your friend for emotional support. and helping with homework when she can't concentrate would be good.|`|fWclxi9Baa	comfort them|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Be her shoulder to cry on suggest you two take the kids to the park.<br>  Tell her your feelings too.

ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	I am going through something incredibly similar to this! <br>  My ex will call me and text me nonstop saying he still loves me and wants us to get back together, and then all of a sudden he'll stop without warning and say he's "done for good". Then it starts all over. Ugh! =/<br>  It's pretty frustrating. I know how you feel. The best thing to do is just try not to have any contact with him. Delete his number from your phone and delete him from your Facebook and MySpace friends. You guys can always try to be friends again later on.<br>  If you did try to get back together, after all, he wouldn't be any better than he is now...he would tell you he loves you and is happy then within a week the problems would come back up and you'd end up breaking up again.<br>  Time is the best thing to heal this. Spend time away from each other. Get your mind on other things and do things you love to do. Hang out with your friends and family. Concentrate on school. Don't let his moods take over your life, it's not worth it.<br>  Good luck!|`|qaiYanF2aa	Why would you want to prolong a relationship that obviously is very rocky.  Would you want to go through life fighting, cursing and have the neighbors call the cops on you?

Why don't you make a concerted effort not to think of him (banish him from your thoughts when he appears) and look around at other men or boys as the case may be?<br>  <br>  You might find yourself much happier experiencing a bit more mature enjoyable relationship.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I am TOTALLY with you! I want things to be a surprise but I LOVE showing them becaise i get so excited lol! I also get irritated when my mom, etc tells poeple about stuff for the wedding because I also want the element of surprise. I am showing very small details and talking in general about things, trying to leave a lot of it to surprise but you're right, it is difficult to find a happy medium!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IDlPFVNDaa	Us, our bridal party, and our parents, that is all, we are being very particular we want this to be a suprise, and normally im indessisive, but right now I only want my fiance's opionion. Of course, I took his mom and my mom and my best friend wedding dress shopping in order to involve both our mothers, while he took both our fathers to a game of golf to get everyone stress relived,  and getting together, but I definetly can say we are going for a suprise.|`|YfxydPF5aa	I am keeping most things a secret, although I did show my close girlfriends my dress. My mom has helped with just about everything. No one else knows about the harpist, cool favors, awesome cake, etc. I think the less people know going in the more they will be pleasantly surprised.|`|YjoFsZuyaa	my friend is getting married in july in turkey, she has shown me her bridesmaids dresses but she wont let anyone but her mum and chief bridesmaid see her medding dress, she wants it to be a surprise.<br>  <br>  i think and element of surprise is best, especially with the brides dress|`|6odO4PK0aa	For My Wedding I did all my attire stuff  with only my Mom and everything else with only my now Husband. So for everyone else it was a Surprise and even for each of them there was lots of surprises! <br>    It's fun that way!|`|8IA3d3NNaa	More of a surprise, i'm showing a FEW people my stuff (like my MOH, my mom) but mostly I want it to be a surprise.|`|crxbob5jaa	Surprise them if you want. But honestly, as a guest I don't care what the little details are. I don't care if you have roses or tulips. Just make sure the ceremony is moving and the reception food is good. If the decor works, it works. <br>  <br>  But when I'm involved in helping with a wedding, I notice those little details and am so excited they came together like the bride had envisioned. But that's just my opinion. If you want to surprise your mom and aunts, then don't be shocked after wards when you expect them to be talking about all the little details and they have moved on to something else in their lives. <br>  <br>  Just my random thoughts. Doesn't mean you shouldn't surprise them. Yet if you think about it, you are probably the only one in the world with the picture of the whole thing in your head. The little things you are showing them are only pieces of the big puzzle. If they see these pieces, they will be more excited to see the entire puzzle put together. (My opinion, but you asked.)  ;-)

It could have hurt his feelings and guys will never admit that. He'll just act weird towards you or ignore you to "get back at you" for hurting him. If you do really like him, you could just be honest and say you got a little nervous because you really like him. That'll make him feel better if that's why he's ignoring you.

Z9HlY0Lpaa	No don't let him get anywhere near you.  If  your family disagrees then i suggest you just go with your thing, screw them.  It's your safety not their's.  Try to avoid him and never go to a room with just him and yourself.  Your father is disgusting.<br>  <br>  He will do it again.  Just like theres a saying if a man abuse you once theres a likely chance your dad will never change.|`|s6b3RnsWaa	Put it this way if I was your mom I wouldn't let him anywhere near you or the rest of the kids. Just because he is your father by blood, doesn't mean he deserves to be a father at all. If you want to feel any normalcy in yours and your family's future, then it is best to write him off. <br>  He failed as a parent..........he did the WORST thing a father could ever do to his child. He's NEVER going to change. I'm not kidding, he's not going to stop. He will do it to someone again.......it may not be with you, but it will be with some child. If you want to feel safe.......tell whoever it is you have to tell that you could never feel comfortable or safe with him again and that he needs to stay away and seek help, although that won't cure him. Once a molestor, always a molestor........sorry it's true. I wish you well, and if your family tries to blame you for what your father did........then voice to them that he hurt you in the most unspeakable way........and that if they loved you they wouldn't stand there and punish you for what he did.......he is the adult, not you.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  <br>  Don't listen to Daniel L............What he is saying is pure foolishness.

I know your answer. Remember that your Dad has been exposed to what he has done to you. I can guaranty you that he will not try to touch you ever again in his life, in any sexual way. The lord teaches us to forgive those that would harm us in any way. So that we do not hold hate within our hearts, that would cause us grief for the rest of our lives. FORGIVNESS is the greatest gift that one can give, for we are not all perfect in our lives, and we all need to be forgiven.

The fact that they are trying to get you to make the decision suggests that they would have real issues if it started again.  In other words - 'you said he could come back, it's not our fault.'<br>  You are perfectly within your rights to say no - since you are the wronged party.<br>  The suggestions so far are all very good:<br>  Contact a councillor/case worker/social services.  If you want a more professional opinion contact childline (0800 1111) or click the link I've included.<br>  This is not your fault - and can I suggest that this man is NOT good for your family (living with the family).  <br>  If everyone wants him back again they can still have him back - but he can live somewhere else.

I used to think that men had no feelings and true love did not exist. I was wrong. I say this because I used to cheat on every one I dated because I thought that they would do the same. I grew up and stopped looking for the perfect man because I really thought they he did not exists. Once I decided I was going to stop focusing on men and I was going to Focus on school and life. I realized that the perfect man was right under my nose. He was someone that came into my work everyday. We are now engaged and live together. We are very happy and we also have a child on the way.

And it's a chemical attraction not only based on looks or feelings but some thing more that scientist are still researching and discovering. I'd also say destiny plays a part in that. But in simple answer to your question yes true unconditional love does exist but not as much as you'd think amongst man kind. It's more of a God and human relationship there where it really exist but in some cases with male and female relationships friendships etc. it exists  to certain extints. Thus in my case with a dear friend slash former girl friend who's found herself yet again heart broken, going thru a divorce or break up and now having "his" that jerks baby too. I'm getting the cold shoulder here but it's all one can do to offer love and support regardless of if she rejects the friendship offers or not there's just something deeper there and she knows I can see right thru it. Call that unconditional love if u must in the midst of her "hatered" it's not total hatered but just I get this that her and guys right now are a major barf there but what ever. Thing is I still love the girl like a friend regardless of how she's reacting and treating me even if she's not spoken a single word. Actions do speak loudly some times. Thing is this one here it's a heart felt thing. Time will tell where it goes. But does unconditional love exist? It absolutely does.|`|I63igrrOaa	i believe in everything.<br>  like the saying.<br>  love has everything to offer.<br>  -i think that's a saying-<br>  idk.<br>  but i think that love is the best<br>  when it's unconditional.<br>  <br>  i have unconditional love for Baron<br>  so i know it's true.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?<br>  answer mine plz:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtX.UULS09jCwb87OB4rKxfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308180230AA2R8Gm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Good Luck!|`|B359bLqsaa	he needs time to calm him fears, and you really shouldn't be pressuring him to have the same level of excitement you have.  what I really think is that you should be more understanding of his situation because its a very scary feeling to be so helpless when your child is so ill.  I would be terrified too.  You are lucky that you didn't have those problems with your other children, but he was not so lucky.  I really think you should meet him on his level instead of asking him to meet you on your level.|`|O9q5IuaHaa	All I can tell you is that this will all change as soon as that child is born! Similar situation here...we had his, mine and then ours that came along as quite the surprise (we r both in our 40's) She was born at 24 weeks gestation...and all the fun things that come with that.<br>  I was the one who refused to speak about the baby, or deal with the upcoming birth. My husband's 25 year old, is autistic...and the fears of poss having a child born...well I'm sure you get it. I didn't even want a baby shower! Inside i felt horrible and that maybe in someway I caused our lil one to be born early weighing lil over a pound. Fear can play a number on your brain in this kind of situation!! Even with all the genetic testing we had done, prior to the birth, i still had these fears. (wish I could explain better) It was so bad for me that when people would ask me questions about my preg I would avoid answering. I am now so in love with this child and could not imagine my life without her! Don't know that this helped you any, but maybe you can understand him a lil better.<br>  <br>  All the best...cheers

I don't care if no body understands period.  If you don't like it then you need to tell him:" I really prefer if you not let this happen again, it really bothers me alot"  I don't care what the excuses are everyone needs to start acting like they have some control over their lips...much less other parts of their bodies.

aipChC3haa	My older sister always regrets the cake she bought.<br>  I know, silly right?<br>  But trust me, that wedding was PERFECT, absolutely gorgeous and nothing was wrong with it, except the cake.<br>  It cost $3,500 and it was HUGE and totally gorgeous.  <br>  And, guess what?<br>  No one liked it.<br>  What happened was that she ordered lemon, and some stupid clerk thought she ordered ORANGE<br>  wtf?<br>  It was horrible.<br>  Us bridesmaids saved it by running to Walmart, where we bought like 20 chocolate cakes, put them on top of each other and served it to the guests.<br>  <br>  But, now we laugh about it =)<br>  It was almost 8 months ago.|`|JJUZFvggaa	I would of never let any one in to letting my evil sister in law in the wedding party. <br>  <br>  I would asked someone to watching my MIL & FIL in-laws while they were drinking before the wedding and having them cut off so they didn't stumble down my isle and say rude loud drunk comments Thur the wedding. <br>  <br>  I would also would of had the stupid cousin in-law and her 4 extras tossed out of our wedding before it started so she didn't make a scene. <br>  <br>  See the the common problem "In-Laws". Yeah if I would of know they were going to act like trash I would of never invited any of them. <br>  <br>  Other then that I would of never changed a thing.|`|ownoc1ZJaa	The only thing I would change is the weather - it downpoured for our wedding day and I would have loved it to be sunny and beautiful.  But everything else went as planned and was lovely.|`|XVzAey4qaa	I would have spent more time dancing and having fun.  I had 350 guests and it took me the entire time to greet them.  I should have said something nice in the beginning to all of them and enjoyed myself.|`|qs6RMGvdaa	Well I haven't gotten married yet, but I know I will probably trip down the aisle. <br>  I'll probably spill something on my dress<br>  I'll be making stupid jokes because I'm nervous<br>  And I'll hate every picture of me.|`|d14ce369f05c355a7fa3761910e845e8aa	I would have had a different groom!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I wouldn't change anything. It was a great day.|`|AA11603468	I wouldn't change one single thing. I loved my day.|`|paerqxfMaa	If I could go back, I would have listened to my Dad, who, as we were getting ready to walk down the aisle, looked at me and said "You know, there's still time to back out of this."  I should have listened, but, no, I was in LOVE and nothing was going to stop me from being with my man.  Silly me!!  The marriage lasted about 2 years.  I did, however, have a wonderful son in the process and that I wouldn't change for anything.|`|pub2GLZPaa	We forgot to invite a couple of people who we really did want there but it just totally slipped our minds. We felt horrible afterwards, calling them etc. One person even sent a card with money despite not being invited!<br>  <br>  I ordered a huge cake and so we basically have another cake left over. I would of gone smaller on the cake.<br>  <br>  I got married in the middle of a semester of university... I would change that. It was too busy.<br>  <br>  Otherwise...... it was perfect :)|`|AA11380378	I could have done without one BM that was a pain all weekend long. Also, I probably would have alloted more time to get ready heheheh<br>  <br>  Everyehing else, was perfect and everything ran smoothly. No regrets. It was the best day of my life and I had the most amazing day of my life.|`|HWiuRgNxaa	i would change the groom<br>  yes regret the whole wedding..... i am engaged again and i am hoping that this one wont have any regrets....lol
IJUfIvDfaa	Ok, here's the thing.  From my own personal experience, he doesn't want to be emotionally involved with you and he doesn't want you to be emotionally involved with him.  So he's not sure if he should sleeping with you because he's know that your feelings are probably only going to get deeper and it's going to become a problem for him, especially if you guys work together.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to let go of someone you work with and have to see everyday.  But let go now and it will only hurt for a little while.  Keep holding on and this situation is going to get ugly and may result in you loosing your job.  I've seen it happen.
JPkgKCNtaa	gap has these really cute little bags that you can put your wet baithing suits in, i think they are around 10 bucks. You could also get like a cute set of pajamas from there, or even a cute towel to go with the baithing suit bag because summer is coming up!|`|jP3KDR0yaa	You can never go wrong with an iTunes Giftcard, EVERY BODY can use that.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	Gift card?  Something cool for her room (lava lamp, etc) or something from Twilight if she is into those books.
zzUgYFy4aa	yes he is playing you both like a violin<br>  <br>  you should remove yourself from the drama<br>  <br>  it is not CUTE or COOL to act this way <br>  <br>  drop the zero and find a real hero
3f25405bb54b8bd96bea8fb3b619327caa	Depends on where you live --- a very romantic spot here is Gatlinburg or Virginia Beach!  Both are relatively inexpensive and if you decide on Gatlinburg --they have great cottages for rent that are cheaper than a hotel!!! They have fireplaces ( with wood provided) and hot tubs right there at the cabin!!! I did this for my Husband one year and we never left the cabin!!! :)
BbWk7RNgaa	Find a trusted adult, a teacher a counselor, your gramma, anybody and tell them this story.  Show them the red marks and they'll believe you.  She does not need to be hitting you.  That is child abuse, and you need to be away from her before she hurts you really bad!|`|ExftbSP7aa	you mom sounds psycho.<br>  and you need to tell someone.<br>  child abuse is not cool.<br>  and throwing away clothes isnt good.<br>  i mean you could donate some if you really do have a lot of clothes, give some to the people that need clothes.<br>  but beating kids = bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjE1EUN6FoHgydvT7nlj5BDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308162413AAKRN8S">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  help ?|`|3U7WTuXraa	I don't think a mom would be that bitchy to do that and beat her child up like that for no reason. No offense, but I think she's crazy. Privacy is one thing that should be respected no matter what, specially as a teenager.|`|Uyi1CTLqaa	She sounds a little crazy to me.  You need to find an adult to talk to about this.  Maybe your father, or a relative.  If not talk to a counselor at school.  Hitting is never ok and that is really a problem.|`|ilFgUw60aa	if that is the seventh or eighth time she has hit you you need to tell somebody maybe the police or another family member i mean that is child abuse maybe she is crazy
3f25405bb54b8bd96bea8fb3b619327caa	Stick with the "real deal"  --If you have a good man that works and is committed to you, then leave the other guy alone.  If he wasn't willing to commit before, what makes you think he is willing to commit now??  Have you seen the movie Picture Perfect with Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Anniston??  Same situation --- he wanted her when she was unavailable and dropped her like a hot rock when she was available! Don't lose a good thing over what might have been thinking.  Chances are you left him alone for a good reason the first time and things will not be different the second time around.  Hope this helps!|`|6891161f5fa2eb4b5d1f494f78a010e7aa	Nothing major??? You are a cheater, and a slut All so you do not respect yourself and your to be husband|`|abeac8e6e9b644636707d8299d872f80aa	its just wedding jitters get over it|`|dfafa13c44e2665995586214355a2672aa	This is a no brainer.  You will be marrying a guy who wants all of you...not just  the good stuff.  Why would you want to be with a guy who only wants one thing?  Don't let the thing with the co-worker go any further.|`|9b5fc494ecfc290fdb2fbe7f0494ce7faa	I think you should get over the co-worker, and go with the one thats going to be there in a longer life|`|e0b887943c22e1bb5047abbb57c5a5fcaa	Keep it professional girlfriend. You already have warning signs blinking. your getting married and the guy at the office will be just the guy in the office again when the flame wheres down. Better chance of getting caught if they already met and you have to ask yourself if its worth it. Cause if it is, you shouldn't be getting married.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	You blew it...my advice is to break off with your fiance he deserves to find someone who will be loyal to him and won't "have to find out" about someone else she used to date.  You are not ready to get married to anyone, you don't have the maturity.|`|AA12134223	i think u like the co worker cause of the sex..the one u r marrying is the one u love or u would not have said yes..u know that once u break it off and/or cheat with they other guy the lust will fade away...so stick with what u know...it's just cold feet
EoPZnFZlaa	Smile.  All these annoying behaviors are just because they care about you.  And just tell them, "Look, I'm enjoying being single.  I'll find someone when it feels right to me."  Good luck and Blessed Be!|`|AA10873763	Explain to them just what you've said here:  That you know what's best for you at this point in your life, and as your FRIENDS they should respect that.<br>  It's hard for some people to appreciate that some of us enjoy being single.  We're not sitting around being miserable, but actually living our own lives.<br>  Good luck.|`|K2dv9u7baa	Tell them that you don't want to have a boyfriend<br>  now; that you are more focused on your grades,<br>  sports, and family. Also, tell them that you <br>  appreciate their recommendations, and that you<br>  may need them in the future. Good luck!
IXskJPlVaa	Both of you are unsure of your relationship together - but have many common feelings, likes and all. Take it easy and give it some more time - may be things take a different turn. Till then enjoy being friends. If either of you get someone better in the interim - you won't have hard feelings. Best of luck.|`|b9354e3ce3aa92254bdc018f28cd8a4aaa	Honey...i'm in da same problem!<br>  i'm jst gonna tell him i like him and see how it goes|`|GZg0io3uaa	huh!! go ahead nd ask him upright nd straight..if possible propose him 2..guys don't braek frndship if d girl propose dem..but d way he flatters u..i guess he is trying hard..2 coerce u 2 accept him as bf...<br>  GUD LUCK|`|bPiAtjV0aa	If you're not sure that if he likes you or not then I don't know if you should like ask him out. And one more thing If you're with a guy never drink for heaven sake cuz then you mess stuff up. Trust me seen it on movies, seen it for real but has never happened to me. And I think that you probably want to think this through and then ask him out since you guys said stuff to each other that you guys haven't told to your other best friends. <br>  <br>    <~Ashley~>(Peace):]|`|iQMox30Faa	This guy as you speak of him he seems to be a genuine man , a gentleman , speaking from my own experience with my fiance , he loves you . When I first met my fiance it was strictly busyness meeting . But we started telling each other things about ourselves as you say you guys did . I remember just how many times she kept on telling me she was not ready for any relationship , in my heart I just knew she was mine cause I saw how compatible we were , every thing about her was just what I needed .<br>  <br>  Honey he loves you just open up to him tell him how you feel|`|lAqV1OmRaa	It's confusing. Either he likes you or is just interested in having you as a very close friend. I say that you lay it all out on the table - just tell him your feelings. It will feel better once it's off your chest. If he doesn't feel the same, then just move on.|`|SIErQrtnaa	sounds like he wants to be friends if hes dating someoen on eharmony .... just see how it turns out<br>  can people please asnwer mine at <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309120012AAA1VBt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	Tell him!

If he wasn't attracted to you then why would he of kissed you back at the conference?<br>  If I were you I would put myself on the dating site that he is on, display all the qualities that you have but would not display a picture.  Find him on this dating site and message him.  Suggest meeting up for easter just before you are due to meet him.<br>  If you's are good friends as you say you are and he does not feel that way about you then you will both be able to work through it and still be friends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - I hope it works as you both sound great for each other|`|krru14Zlaa	well try to feel his emotions and if you really like him aways tell him when your ready.how long have you been knowing each other?try to figure his heart.make sure he's willing to be your friend because you don't want to go through heartbreak and good luck !
tUgnYyw4aa	she might like you.  try talking to her and at least try to become friends  it might even end up as more|`|ZbxcHDh2aa	Maybe she wants to be your friend <br>  dont take any offence but are you a Lesbian?|`|F7EhEYSYaa	Um......wait, if shes a girl and ur a girl.......why have u been eye flirting??<br>  i dont have a problem though.|`|dhTMwvDvaa	she might like you. probabally. i'd ask her. ur lesbian then??? mmk....well if she's straight, then no, but if she's lesbian too.....then i'd take that as a sign she rly likes you. so ask her. =D
4EWCegiRaa	This is too ridiculous to be a real question... go play your Xbox or something and stop wasting out time.|`|gEkLQWF4aa	Hahaha..I can't believe some people actually took you seriously on this. You crack me up.|`|xDlBM6N6aa	That's kinda sick....actually that's disgusting.  You shouldn't have let that happen, cause now it might happen again and again oh and again...bad choice for you to have done this in the first place.  I'll tell you that much.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Don't do it.  You will feel even worse later and regret it.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Go speak to a counselor.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	Fiction.  Go get another fantasy while I purge this stupid question from my brain.|`|Gw32L6Hoaa	thats quite weird, i would either talk to her and see if you can sort something out or you should talk to a counciler|`|0tL4zgTPaa	this is so sick!!!!!!!!!<br>  you need to go to a counsellor
GRAE6K1iaa	Hmm tough! There are only two options and neither satisfy you. I just want to say one thing, never change yourself for others! You will never be happy! Never go against you ethics and values in order to make someone else happy. There is a quote, " Be hated for what you are, than loved for something your not", I am not sure who said this, but I know it from a dear friend.<br>  <br>  This world is full of fake people, no one does anything unless their benefit is hidden, or are conquered by love.  <br>  <br>  The question you need to ask yourself is, What do I want to do? What makes me feel good?, don't care about other people, this is your life! You weren't born for other people. Just follow you heart, and it will lead you to great success, there is something called Will-Power, I think you are losing dedication and passion for what you do, perhaps you should try and build your will-power and re-gain the passion and love for what you do. <br>  <br>  This is a really tough question, I know I haven't really addressed your question. But I hope it helped. Look for some inspiration in life.  There is something very inspirational, a loved one gave me. <br>  <br>  Gandhi's Talisman. <br>  <br>  "I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her]. Will he [she] gain anything by it? Will it restore him [her] to a control over his [her] own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?<br>  Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away."|`|1TSMdgG1aa	Depends what it is.........what decision is this?  I can't really answer unless you clarify.|`|78c7e5f1302752cfd76fcfc9a76b885aaa	i don't know what to say...<br>  i would re track if that's what i'm happy with
AA11990465	I think its stupid and not worth the trouble that someone would get into for doing it. Morally wrong, no, legally yes.|`|370e691422f07fe796ab12f350d57094aa	Better idea is in this situation,to get divorce as soon as possible.<br>  In this cheating situation there are not moral values at all.Then is not<br>  worthy to fight or even think to fight for the cheater.Both (man an the cheater) know what they are doing is 100% wrong at all,and the fault is for<br>  both (man and woman).It is a fantasy to think,that only  the guy has the fault,when the cheater woman let him to date her.Good question.|`|SovaFpN8aa	NO! Especially if you catch them in the act. Do not touch the wife, all domestic violence laws protect her, but take it out on him! Then get the best divorce attorney you can afford, and put her skanky butt to the curb! <br>  EDIT<br>  Too many people today refuse to take responsibility for their own actions. A man willing to bed a married woman is gambling with his own life. If caught, he will be lucky to get away with ONLY a stiff beating, and he DESERVES IT!|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Is she STILL "dating"? Look at it this way, what better way can you punish either of them by letting them have each other? I think that's karma for ya. Besides, she will subject him to movies with subtitles, and then there is that knitting needle thing. Don't hurt those precious hands of yours, you'll need them for the woman who comes along that really loves you. For more than 30 minutes.....|`|I814g6ZBaa	No one can tell you its wrong to feel what you feel.  They're just FEELINGS.<br>  Now, it would be kinda wrong to meet up with him in a dark parking lot, or driveway or something, and not give him the heads-up to defend himself....<br>  But IMO, your wanting to lay the smack-down on him mano a mano is completely normal.  <br>  Best to you, Sweetie.<br>  xoxoxo|`|uXOhQidGaa	Yes, that guy made you no promises and has done you no harm. <br>  <br>  The person who made you promises and broke them when you were depending on them is your wife. <br>  <br>  But I don't advocate beating the crap out of her, either.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Yes, it is wrong and stupid. The problem is with you are your wife. Fix that. Good Luck|`|an1EMiFkaa	Yes. Its not his fault.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	Morally, as in 'just desserts', no.  Legally, yes.  Your real issue is with your wife.  Don't beat her, though.  Talk to her and find out what the hell she is thinking.  Go to counseling and try to make your marriage rock solid.  If that doesn't work, leave and find someone who will be true to you.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Addressing your Edit:  You want to scare him.  That could backfire.  If you know you can 'handle your business,' that's what real men are supposed to do...Godspeed|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	Personally, I would tell her to get out and go be with that guy.  It's obvious that she doesn't want to be with you.  Why?  Do you treat her badly or does she just cheat to be cheating?  Why do you put up with it?|`|V0qntsyZaa	If a man or woman is "dating" someone married they need to review their own morality and integrity while wearing the shoes of the spouse.|`|gZdKOms8aa	Yes,you should leave her. He couldn't "date" her against her will. besides,she's a tramp. She isn't worth risking an assault charge for.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I know exactly how you feel.  I felt the same way too.  I wanted revenge on the women my husband cheated with.|`|XmI8wNaCaa	Im sure it's hard for you to not do that. You should at least lunge at him. Make him pee his pants|`|Cpwedckvaa	Nope...I still think about getting my hands on the filthy whore that my husband played with...it's natural|`|AuKKjaxaaa	If someone attempts to seduce my wife, knowing she's my wife, he's challenging my manhood.  I would assert my manhood as I deemed most appropriate to the situation, which would likely involve my fists, knees, and feet and various surfaces of his body.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't take her saying 'yes'.  It would just take him trying to emasculate me.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yes.  Your wife is the one who defiled your marriage, not the guy she used to defile it.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Yep, I do.  <br>  <br>  If you're pissed off about your wife cheating, then why not take it up with her?  Why attack the other guy?  She's the one who broke her covenant and her vows with her husband.  The guy who was sleeping with her may be nothing more than a scavenger, but it seems foolish to blame him.  <br>  <br>  My wife did cheat on me, years and years ago, and my issues were with her, not the person she cheated with.  Now, if they person she cheated with kept pushing it, after the affair was over, then I can understand being pissed.|`|fwLW0cUQaa	Nope,he deserves it, unless he didnt know she was married|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Yes, morally and legally wrong. Beating him isn't going to change the fact that your wife is a dirty cheater.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Yes.  Better to get a restraining order against him.
daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	We registered for just a few things before our engagement party and got some stuff off of it. But everyone else gave us cash. Anywhere from $50-$200.<br>  And yes we got separate gifts at the wedding. Our engagement party was also two years before the wedding.<br>  Edit: We never told anyone we were registered. They went out and looked on their own. In my area it's expected to give a gift at an engagement party. Yeah it's not required but it's the right thing to do. You wouldn't show up at a dinner party without a bottle of wine or something? It's the same kind of idea. The point of the party isn't to get gifts obviously but it happens unless you write 'your presence is enough of a present'|`|4lL34wJnaa	Usually for engagement parties, brides are given something useful for the home, usually something small, like  anice picture frame or vase.  If you do not want such things, some people may give cash, or they may go out on their own and pick something for you, which could spell disaster!|`|AA11380378	Nothing. An engagement party is just a party where you make the announcements and gifts are not customary, nor should be expected or requested. Some guests may come with a card, a potted plant, flowers or champagne, which are usually some small things that some people could bring.<br>  <br>  Registries and gifting are for the shower and the wedding itself. Not before. By NO MEANS start asking for gifts or register for the engagement party. Not appropriate. That is not the place or the moment. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aipChC3haa	If you want cash, have the bridal party spread it around by word of mouth.<br>  Definatly don't ask for money, but have the bridal party spread it aorund that the couple wants money =)<br>  We are doing that, and since our friends are really high society, it will problably cover 50% (or more) of our $35,000 wedding.<br>  <br>  Usual gift is like a toaster or something.|`|eY83kAZBaa	Anything for the kitchen. Maybe a hanging pot and pan rack. Pier One Imports and Bed Bath & Beyond are good places to find gifts. Pampered Chef would also be good.|`|PGx3uPrSaa	we didn't registar and we got cash from all the guests.|`|LqomT0tPaa	I've read that you should never expect a gift from an engagement party and that it is poor etiquette to register for gifts before an engagement party because it makes your guests feel like they are required to bring one.

Some very common gifts are household items, his and her's stuff, coffee makers, dish sets, a scrap book that the couple could put pictures of their life together in, things like that. Weddings are special, go for more sentimental things. Good Luck!

InXhzOCnaa	Well you obviously sound quite understanding, so understand that it's really not a nice thing to go through so obviously when she's having it then she's not going to be her normal self! Basically just if she seems a bit argumentative or gets upset easier and is sensitive etc, just realise that it's probably not that you've done anything wrong! I wouldn't try and comfort her by saying "It's ok im here" or something - because it could get a bit awkward lol. <br>  <br>  Just accept that its only for about a week and after that she'll more than likely be back to normal! It does take a while to get used to but it's not her real emotions its just the crazy hormones in her body that are making her feel like this! I know some girls who feel suicidal at this time so trust me just be yourself but be a bit more careful with things and don't get hurt if she lashes out at you :)|`|yAQJlblpaa	well us girls feel different during this time of the month.<br>  some of us can be in extreme pain where as others can be in in a terrible mood and will want to kill you if you look at them differently.<br>  There's not much you can do really just take it easy with her.Don't ask her too many questions because that annoys me at that time.Just give her space and she should be okay.|`|66NeNxwyaa	Don't treat her differently and don't act like you know whats going on, that is private. Just be normal and I'm sure she'll appreciate you more.|`|GAbGgdQ4aa	Just be more lenient with her, and otherwise I wouldn't treat her any differently.|`|XqcmZ7cDaa	Just be yourself, but not weird. Just stay away from anything that can be offensive to her. Maybe send her something yummy to eat. Just dont act weird.|`|TIDqJgdSaa	be nice to her lol when your on your period you feel like you wanna punch someone. <br>  we are usually in REALLY BAD MOODS DURING THIS TIME <br>  and have short tempers <br>  its painful sometimes.. so she may not feeling so good so be there BE NICE dont make her angry when US girls are on our periods we are a BIT RUDE and want to hit something lol and really not in the mood for many things :))  just bee cool with her, let her have a sholder to lean on if she needs too|`|qs6RMGvdaa	Well when a girl is on her period, you be careful about what you say and do and don't hold anything against her. <br>  <br>  I know I bite my boyfriends head off when I'm on my period.
IS8waet7aa	I think it's not a matter of her sex drive "shutting down", but more likely she begins to not desire HIS hands on her, or HIS obligatory kisses (if there are any). I feel very taken for granted, only been married almost 8 years (2nd marriage) and he's got his own issues that are causing him to take me for granted. Doesn't even want to engage into conversation about it. Sure, it makes you feel like something is wrong with YOU, but, it's not YOU, hun, it's HIM.|`|RjyJCctdaa	Not necessarily, some women just find someone else to get the attention from lol|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Would YOU want to have sex with an AZZHOLE??????<br>  <br>  Didn't think so!<br>  <br>  <br>  LMFAO!|`|NuvKPl3naa	i agree with valerie. your sex drive does not go down, the man who treats you bad makes you not want to be with him. guarantee if a man came along and treated you right and loved you the sex drive would come right back.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Yes it is true, but it happens to both, not just one. Unless of course he is a dog who doesn't care about anyone but himself.<br>  My ex has never turned me on sexually because she is heavy. Plus I date for the spiritual side and if the inner side is ugly. The outer side become ugly.<br>  The one thing that my ex was good at, was oral sex. <br>  When I would catch her in her lies all the time. Eventually that joy in that went away because it was like having sex with a liar, and to me if you have to lie all the time, you become a big turn off for me. And if I don't like you my sex drives die.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Well do you if he is treating you like that. Yes I would cut him off and find me a man who knows how to treat a lady.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes its true ..but you can help your self out of it just by saying i will go then .. ok|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Of course. Who wants to have sex with someone who treats them poorly?|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	OR , <br>  maybe , the women's behavior , attitude , lack of life skills  ,<br>  constant drain on what happiness there is in life , turns the man into<br>  a victim of her inability to get her act together . <br>  <br>  Therefore producing long term resentful behavior from the man for having selected a less than desirable spouse , who has entrapped him in a no win scenario that progressively deteriorates and time marches on .<br>  <br>  Thus , she is the recipient of her own actions , and feels that issuing <br>  blame to anyone other than herself is the only appropriate thing to do . So , then she holds out on the sex , which just validates what the man already knows .|`|JV0i77uiaa	Definitely true.  Who want to be with a jerk that does not appreciated you.  Love is a like plants or flower if you don't nurture or watering them the die.|`|4tvAtQRSaa	Sure.....how can you feel sexual towards someone when they treat you this way?  You are protecting yourself and after awhile you just get into the habit of keeping your sexual feelings on the shelf.|`|AVDn7Imqaa	Yes its true, if you don't feel good about yourself you have no reason to use it.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Well does it not causes depression. And then the women slowly shuts down.|`|G6Uy43coaa	Valerie X is right.....shuts down to the azzez...but that's all I meet so....its true.|`|0BX8Lozkaa	Yes tis true|`|dTaGzh6Haa	yes
EBnofxgpaa	Maybe,<br>  or maybe he likes you.|`|5V5L9DoBaa	i dont think it's appropriate to go to church or religion classes for such reasons.<br>  you should pay attention in class, this is not a good thing, please don't do it and find somewhere else to look for potential dates|`|23303c716fcc561c771bc0c9c020c7d8aa	maybe i guess|`|AA10564216	probably|`|tZES73R0aa	No he probably just thinks your weird. Just kidding... he probably does i need more info!|`|FJbzvDPtaa	its a toss up . i think maybe|`|2CWmEnlHaa	no this is confusing but im gonna go with no and that he likes u!|`|WsNBjyGiaa	Probubly, i mean if he smart. But thats not a bad thing, yall should go to the movies by yallselves sometime. and p.s. its a little confusing.
15kiWTGQaa	your mate has you to talk to, right?<br>  <br>  Sounds like her family isn't being very fair with her concerning her feelings. Tell her not to feel like her feelings aren't important, because no matter what her parents say, they are. Your friend should talk to another relative who is close to the problem and can help. If there is no one, then perhaps a school councilor?<br>  <br>  good luck|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	she has you <br>   she should be proud that she is not getting that kind of attention.<br>    I would guess that her brother is so messed up that his failures are the top priority in the house but that is no indication that she is not loved <br>   Remember it is the squeaky wheel that get greased first|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	I loved it when my parents didn't pay attention. I got away with more lol. jk...<br>  Seriously though they must think she is more mature and responsible because she doesn't need their attention 24.7...|`|xBd96wvRaa	Since they won't listen. <br>  Tell her to ask her parents; What do I need to do to get a little attention around here?<br>  <br>  What if I get suspended from school? Shall I start a fight? Perhaps if I get caught shoplifting? Will you acknowledge me then? <br>  <br>  I want some attention.<br>  <br>  She should be ready to suggest an activity to do with her parents. <br>  Like I want to go for a walk very evening for a half hour with each parent, alternating. Dad on even days and Mom on odd days.<br>  <br>  Make sure the activity does not cost any money or the parents will write off the suggestion as manipulation. <br>  <br>  Parents are people too and it is ok for your friend to in a non-temper tantrum way say what she wants or needs.|`|G1T0dCjaaa	just keep letting her know that your always gonna be there for her and she'll pull through. eventually her family will notice her and if they don't then its there loss.|`|estQv3Hbaa	Be wild get a boyfriend i dont know just find a way to get a tention.
4lL34wJnaa	My fiance is the same way!  Thankfully, we're almost done with planning our July 2009 wedding.  When I talked to him about it he would give me the same types of answers you are referring to.  To solve this, we discussed that I would choose something and then he would get to "OK" my decision before it was final.  I would put together 2 or 3 color schemes that you like and then just ask him to pick his favorite and go with that.  That will make it easier and you will get a little of his input!  I would do that with most of your decisions except the really big things.   I made all of the appointments at times I knew he could make and he then came with me to the big ones.  Most guys don't care about the details as long as they marry the love of their lives!<br>  <br>  The things my fiance wanted to be directly involved in were:<br>  1) Picking the venue  <br>  2) Choosing the menu including cake<br>  3) Meeting with the officiant<br>  4) Honeymoon<br>  5) Picking the music (my fiance is a professional musician so we're having friends of his play the ceremony and reception)<br>  <br>  Every other decision I ran by him before making it final.  For example, I told him our color scheme was going to be light blue and white with some pink accents.  He was ok with it as long as I didn't make him or the groomsmen wear pink!|`|8bTder08aa	Cupcake, all the future husband has to do is show up at the wedding fully clothed and sober, and he's done his part.<br>  <br>  Most men do not want to get involved in choosing colors, flowers, songs, venues, favors, script on the invitation or anything of that sort.<br>  <br>  If you want to get him involved, ask him about food or drink at the reception, and maybe choosing a groom's cake.<br>  <br>  I'm sure he shares your excitement, but very few men ever get down to the level of detail on a wedding that the bride gets into.<br>  <br>  And that's okay.|`|YjoFsZuyaa	men are indecisive ... maybe have ideas yourself, for example have maybe three colour schemes you like and get him to choose from those 3, and say to him it would mean a lot to you for him to have the final choice<br>  <br>  many men think the wedding planning is girly stuff ... so whittle down your favourite choices and then make him choose from a few different things.<br>  <br>  he may be more interested in choosing the food and drink, so ensure you involve him in that.|`|typarmrzaa	my FH was the same way at the beginning. As time went on he became a lot more interested in the planning. he still isn't as interested as i am, he is a guy after all, but he definitely shares his opinions.|`|G50ucmllaa	He's a guy.....you need to choose a few things you like and then lay them in front of him and say "Which one do you like...".|`|yOsEeTUnaa	Sometimes men need simpler questions to answer...as my husband did! Instead of asking him what color schemes, as him to choose one and have a couple of choices for him! And if he cannot even answer then...then it is probably that he really does not care about the details! Some men just don't really care one way or the other! Good luck!|`|iDfRTLklaa	Maybe you can give him a job to do to make him feel more included in the wedding.  My cousin was quite proud of the fact that he was the one that picked the cake for his wedding.  So maybe you can give him a job, like that to get him motivated.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Narrow your choices down to two things and let him pick which he likes best. Also, alot of brides say they give the duties of figuring out catering and music to the grooms since they naturally gravitate toward those things. <br>  <br>  Just because he is vague or doesn't seem that enthusiastic doesn't mean he doesn't want to get married. He was most likely raised with the mindset that countless folks here at Y!A subscribe to that it's the bride's day only and his opinion doesn't matter since all he is expected to do is show up, which is not true in the least.
nnJAaDX8aa	that great! i congratulate you. <br>  the look that you described is good i like it personally<br>  groomsmen just throwing ideas here: be black tux maybe with a yellow and orange handkerchiefs or ties or even the vests. ur choice my dear!|`|xuiSfzgraa	I would put the grooms men in either black or brown tuxes or suits, then for vest/ties alternate them in yellow and orange.
VG2V2EbGaa	yes it was. when it gets to the point where you're not happy anymore, the relationship should either be talked about and solved or thrown out. it sounds like he was overprotective and thats really annoying, especially if ur in high school or junior high... i just broke up with my bf for the same thing kinda. <br>  answer mine? the friends with benefits one... =/|`|JOtnpGaQaa	yeah it was. he sounds like they type of guy that likes to control everything. I mean he cant tell you who you can hang out with! Thats stupid. How would he feel if he had a friend thats a girl and you said he couldnt do that. He'd get mad. He needs to put himself in your shoes.|`|r9yowD2Iaa	You sound like you're better off without him. Even if he wasn't a bad boyfriend you obviously didn't communicate well.|`|yxqMBDLwaa	yes it was.
cHOZqxM8aa	If theres like something like a dance coming up, then ask her if she's planning on going,<br>  If she is then ask her if she has a  date; if not then ask her if she wants to go with you :)<br>  <br>  If there isnt a dance or anything coming up, <br>  Then just ask her if she's busy Friday/saturday/ whatever<br>  And if she feels like going to the movies or something<br>  <br>  Meh, its worth a try.<br>  The worst she can say is no.<br>  <br>  p.s if she does say no, then just say 'Oh, okay. Maybe some other time' <br>  Its makes it slightly less embarassing haha.|`|Vfz3I1Lsaa	don't just ask her like that everybody uses that line, since u know her from 5 months ago there's something she's interested that u know (let's say photography)...look for a photography exposition or something she likes and say to her: i've been planning to go to X event and i thought you might be interested in it, do want to go with me?...|`|QNr2TWfLaa	Just be open to her &let her know how you feel. She might feel the same way too. You can start it off with a date then ask her at the end of the night, or you can simply call her out for a talk and ask her if she wants to go out with you. <br>  <br>  Good luck with that. I'm sure it'll go out right(;
qMnuRO50aa	Join a bunch of clubs and extracurriculars. The best thing to do in high school is to be involved in a lot of stuff, so that you don't fit into a 'clique' and don't find yourself judged by that clique's standards.
GYoNyoWtaa	Well I don't have a daughter. But I am a daughter and I had plenty of boyfriends that my parent's didn't like. They didn't like the way he wore his jeans you know showing his underwear. They didn't like the fact that he smoked. And they hated his family they were complete white trash.<br>  <br>  So trust me if your daughter has a bad boyfriend...just give it time and she will realize just like I did =)|`|N5v2j6hPaa	I honestly like my daughters boyfriend but I think he is a push over with her|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	That he is dating my daughter and there is no possible way he can be good enough for her!  <br>  <br>  This not only applies to the guy she may be dating now, but to all those that she has dated in the past, and those that she may date in the future.|`|UhbyuzuXaa	He's been divorced, 2 kids, 30 something she's only 19.
PwZZJh1taa	you never really know someone until you live with them. what at one time was once a very wonderful thing is now becoming a factor in other lives besides your owns. your home is your sons home and you brought someone there, a complete invasion of his privacy. you also have implemented a threshold between her and your son and the future will inevitably entail this threshold be crossed and you will be stuck in the middle forced to make a decision between the 2. not good. anyway whats done is done. hope for the best, pray. your son is #1 and she is # 2 in case you had any thoughts on this order. remember also that you can not change people and shouldn't try. the fact that she has male confidants is something that you shouldn't be insecure over as well. its always nice to have a member of the opposite sex give you their point of view on a subject, it don't hurt anyways. i will leave you with this .... alcohol and depression should never be mixed, they will inspire anger rage and violence. it may be time to end this living situation or at the very least back up a bit, she needs to live somewhere else. the fact shes 21 and you old enough to be her mother probably to her you treat her as a child and that is a short fuse too. move on, take care of #1 and yourself. your love life is sacrificial and new ones are easily found.|`|TkaCQjpPaa	For one, you should divid your question into paragraphs, or other people are not going to read this like me.|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	If you have trusted her in the past, I think you should continue to trust her now. She made a mistake and if you love her I think things will be alright :)<br>  If she doesn't understand explain to her how you're feeling, it's not bad to go out and have one drink or so.|`|NAKYRvwqaa	Maybe she should see a therapist.  It looks like she needs a professional to talk to.  Tell her either she does that or finds a way on her own to reduce her stress (going to see her grandmother's grave may help her) or she has to leave.|`|hMNOBYHCaa	There are a couple things going on here, and I hope I'm not going come across as rude with anything I'm going to say, because I don't mean it that way.<br>  <br>  The first thing is the sensitive part.  Your little icon suggests you're a woman, and you refer to your girlfriend.  Your relationship may be confusing for your son since it's not the standard issue. Is this the best environment for him?  Actually, whether the other person was the same gender or the opposite, I would say this.  Kids can get hurt when a relationship ends and the other person disappears from their lives.  What you do is your business, not mine in any way shape or form, but your first responsibility is to your son. <br>  <br>  The second thing is the age difference.  She's pretty young and still may have some wild oats to sow.  She's not drinking or smoking in front of your child, and you don't really say she was drunk, just that you thought it was more than one beer.  You probably over indulged once in a while at that age too.  The cigarette smoke could have been from other people smoking around her. <br>  <br>  If you try to stop her from having a drink or two with her friends, you're going to turn into the old fogie at home.  What do you think was wrong with what she did?  Maybe you just need to give her a little space.  There's nothing to suggest she was cheating on you, and she should be able to have friends besides you and your mutual friends.  You may find that you're in different places in your lives.  I have friends who are much younger than me, and there are some levels on which we just can't relate.<br>  <br>  I didn't understand about the "daughter who wasn't her biological".  The 21 year old girl was raising someone else's kid?  Until now, she was pretty much a kid herself.|`|QPTGs62Iaa	I think that you should believe her. Has she ever given you a reason to distrust her? She's also going through a tough time. Deaths can leave some devastated for years, i know that first hand.<br>  Soo I say give it a shot. Believe her.|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	screw me once:shame on you<br>  screw me twice: shame on me
RiVvH0vGaa	Just tell him about how much you like him. I am very sure he likes you too because hes really close to you and he wants to know more about you(even though personal) which is cute. GOOD LUCK!!|`|N8OsjKuRaa	just come staraight out nd tell him that if he likes yuh then he shud tell yuh nd if he doesnt then he shud still tell yuh cuhz he's sending yuh mixed signals and maybe yuh guys can still be friends!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  btw..i hope this helped! if yuh have more questions emailme!!!! =]|`|wc7WCTfGaa	just tell him that u like him and ask him out if hes asking u than u might be the girl.ask him out its the best choice
BYQ2kHPjaa	Wait it out if you really want to, but I think unless you are certain that she likes you back then you are just asking to be hurt even more. Sometimes you have to let people go, so my advice would be to forget her and move on. If she liked you as much as you like her, then she wouldn't have gotten back with her ex. Good luck xx|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	im thinking you should tell her how you feel.<br>  its not good to keep things bottles up.<br>  Just go for it,<br>  and if she really does like her ex, then tough.<br>  worth a shot right?
iEaoPEZ1aa	Dude, he pissed you off. Just stay away from him for a little while - sounds like you guys have some friends in common so you'll be back to being friends in a little while. & next time, don't go off crying - just tell him that you're shedding leprosy. That should be enough of a hint to get him off. If it doesn't work, just come out & say - "kiddo, we're friends & I'm happy with things that way. Quit trying to get fresh."|`|9hnNDNdGaa	tell him that his txts hurt you, and you dont no if u can go back to the way u were. maybe he will truly apologize and mean it or try to make it up to you.

So i Called him up one day out of the blue & now everythings perfect :)|`|lO1jP3XCaa	that means you love him or you just miss talking to him because you could tell him everything|`|yKUYapAkaa	he dont have his phone number or email?<br>  does he have a FB or myspace<br>  im sure there's some kind of way you too can stay in touch<br>  never know, you might run into him sometime soon|`|sriByWZBaa	It's hard seperating from those great friends you had and then having to seperate from them for a while. My advise for you is to keep contact to him somehow. By computer, letters, or better yet the phone! Don't just sit and wait hoping to see him soon. Make an effort and show that you really want to talk to him and you miss him. Maybe next year you will see him in your high school! But always remember that you will or have many friends in high school that might be as great as friend as he is!
AXbdNdPzaa	Yes, there is a chemical reaction.  That has been proven.|`|an1EMiFkaa	I agree with that statement.|`|XmI8wNaCaa	Well you can feel if they are intrested in you and then it gets more exciting. I don't beleive in soul mates but some people are better suited for each other the others|`|mCM363I9aa	I agree, you feel that connection but the question is "do they feel it too?"|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	There is more Truth to that than you will ever know.
Ocv4G6Y4aa	Many ceremonies I have been too just the mothers went up to light the candles.  If you are not interested in that, then you really have to explain to the grooms step mother, that this is your wedding and this is his biological child.  There is no reason she should be upset, that's just childish.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	The groom's step mother needs to mind her business on this one.  He wants his biological parents to light it and she isn't his biological parent.  It shouldn't offend her, but if it does she needs to get over it.  At my wedding, the mothers lit the candles so that's another option but if he really wants his father to light it also that won't work.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	This is just my opinion but I think it just only be biological parents.  If the step-mom doesn't like it too bad.  She did not give birth to your husband so she should not be up there.  Just tell her (if you do decide this) that it's your day and this is how it's going to be.|`|crxbob5jaa	Someone needs to explain to step mom that this is not about couples. You love all of them. Someone needs to explain this is about the bride and groom and is a symbol from their parents to them. That means, two parents to each person. The brides parents and the grooms parents. They should be able to be civil long enough to light the candles. <br>  <br>  Or you could do what another bride did. Her dad was walking her down the aisle and her fiance's dad was performing the ceremony. The mother's were the only ones lighting the candles. It worked and was very touching.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	First off, it's your wedding. No one else should be telling you what they do or don't want.<br>  Next off, it would be weird for your fiance's step mom to light a candle. It doesn't sound like he's that close with her. He needs to respect his mother and her place, and the step mom needs to respect her place.It makes sense to have both biological parents light the candle since they made him together. If his step mom has a problem with it, it's just too bad, it's not about her.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	the biological mothers are supposed to light the candles, step parents will understand and if you dont like the politics of that if you both have a grandmother thats still living, use the one thats been in your lifes the most.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i'd tell the new wife to shuv it. its not her wedding. those are his parents and always will be and they should be the ones to do it.|`|Z5rIQE7Gaa	I have never heard of this candle ceremony.<br>  <br>  I sort of remember the couple getting married lighting a candle together but not the parents.<br>  <br>  It will not help you at all to make the stepmom feel awful. A divorce is a divorce. The biological parents should not go up together. <br>  <br>  I'd skip the whole candle thing. If the groom's dad is even somewhat normal he will stand up for his new wife. The only one who really wants the biological parent thing is the groom and maybe his mom just to tick off the new wife and throw her weight around.<br>  <br>  Don't start the marriage and family relationship off on a bad foot. Skip the candle thing. You'll be just as married and people will be happier.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Just have the mothers, light the candles. The brides mom, the grooms bio- mom. That way your problem is solved. I have never seen the fathers go up to light the candles, It is always done by just the mothers.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Is it possible to skip this part of the ceremony?  You don't want any hard feelings on your wedding day.  You don't want anyone to ruin this day for you.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Traditionally it's the mothers who light it. Not both parents. So what about just having your mom and his bio mom light it?
dh5oIIWeaa	This Is a very odd thing for a principal to say.<br>  Many of us are shy, but school is an excellent place to work on it if it is a  problem. Your school should have several social clubs organized around interests such as science, photography, the school paper etc.<br>  Pick one or two things you are interested in and join one. The common interest will give you something to interact about and a basis for founding a friendship. Once you have a few friends your social network will grow naturally.<br>  Making a start is the hard part. Just give it a try.|`|liid9ZTqaa	You are maybe too sturbon.|`|zprAkP3eaa	Sounds stupid to me!
OIBIqDGtaa	yeah i think everyone has. but its your own opinion as to whats cute and whats ugly.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	yeahh<br>  i saw this really really hot guy and his girl was fat and ugly<br>  it made me think why i couldnt get a guy like that<br>  i guess some people care more about personality<br>  =]|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Ugly is from your perception. Someone may be not so pretty in the conventional way but be wonderful in a human sort of way. Study the person and you might learn something.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	totally, plus the guy was an ***.  I saw them walking in the halls and I was just like, "Wait what'd I miss?"<br>  <br>  oh, it was the cute girl/ugly dude one|`|PeNTl6KOaa	its not bout looks, its bout the personality, it just shows that those people r in it for the love nt for the looks<br>  <br>  x|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	Yeah it just means not everyone in this world is extremely shallow.|`|htWw0OlCaa	yes, what is with that?....|`|DFSHoO4uaa	yeah i do but i love it cause it makes u realize that the person is going for the inside and also she is beautiful in his eyes so it makes me smile also cause that means there's hope for all of us!|`|52bb38389ace91aedab5837d20eb5996aa	me and my guy are like that. of course im the cutie. jk. however there are couples like that but once you fall in love with the person that person is beautiful in all there imperfections|`|r8kRHyu7aa	Yeah, it's good to see some people just care more about personality though|`|gAC4QY7gaa	It's amazing how some people in the world base relationships other than looks huh?|`|Bv5dJQMFaa	ya all the time!!|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	yes. theyre pretty common.....|`|GLBWe3A9aa	Yes what's wrong with that?|`|3c443ee00e72ff56c472359a9f0c1abbaa	Totally. I think we all have haha|`|n7uF90t3aa	Yeah, they're all over the place.  I always assume that the ugly one has something going for them, maybe they're really smart or really funny or really rich or just really awesome.  The funny thing is, most people make fun of cute/ugly couples but I always think they look a lot happier than those couples with two really hot people that always act like they hate each other's guts.|`|Nc9CywDsaa	It's not about what you look like on the outside. If you see a couple who is ugly and is with someone who is beautiful then that's wonderful. It's not about looks. Two people like that love each other. They don't care about the way they both look. Those couples probably have lots in common with each other.|`|mRZ6Z1O3aa	Yeah, I see that a lot.<br>  I guess it's because the ugly girls aren't sluts and the pretty girls have bad personalities. Not always but most of the time. and the same with the other way around the ugly guys are not players. aha it's rare but if they're in love i don't complain :)|`|26KPiekKaa	Yeah alot of the times, why do you want to waste 5 points asking this useless question? And yes, I do see them all the time, I saw this really hot girl with an ugly guy who had a mustache and a beard! How could that hot girl like him?|`|2mPD5rNsaa	ALL THE TIME :(<br>  opposites attract they say. Clearly fit lads just want dorks.<br>  And fit gurls want freakky lads :)<br>  LOL<br>  <br>  Mine Please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArB6RkJRdsn1rLYox0shqdLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309113638AA6ZG8L">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|IUd25p1Naa	The person cant be that ugly if you think the person they are with is cute then that "cute" person must find the person you think is ugly attractive.|`|D5UAhY8jaa	of coarse the girl was hot and the guy was ugly then the girl saw me and asked me out she says im her hotty lol|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	Yeah! What the hell is that? Or relationships where the guy is gorgeous and the girl is super fat! Love is so freaking weird!!|`|aVNwBZ1Jaa	haha one time i saw this reeaalllyy skinny red-haired short teenager, who was dating a heeeuge fat girl. and they started making out right in front of me! EWWW =P|`|G2A3iyfgaa	Yes, and I think that's a great thing. Shows how some people aren't shallow and only go for looks.|`|Uxcp7z0uaa	yea i always thought hard on why that happens. but i learned that it is because of personilty and sometimes love|`|sBOZZ8Kpaa	No, I've just seen two people who care for each other.<br>  <br>  Grow up.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	oh god.<br>  <br>  some people are just shallow....<br>  <br>  yes not everyone is superficial.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	yes look at hugh hefner and all his girls are drop dead gorges with him|`|maT3jCmNaa	yea............|`|1cbEQ1sQaa	yess indeed. <br>  but honestly its not all about the looks<br>  not only do we all have different tastes but looks arent evrything.<br>  you can date the prettiest girl ndd she can be so annoyingg ndd self centerred.<br>  or you can date a cute guy and he can be such a dick! <br>  but it really doesnt matter i think the best to go would be by personality! :)<br>  eitherr wayy that isnt ppls problem whether or not their cute or ugly there togther for a reason!|`|R1HiVgBSaa	yeah i have. lol. i always see that i know that people say that it's the inside that counts but that cant be 100% true. haha|`|37BgyLkFaa	yeah i hate how hot girls all go for the wierdos, theres a few lads getting all the nicest girls and theyre really not the best looking. im left feeling 'im hot, why not me?'|`|hEYMqfRBaa	yup i see couples like that all the time! sometimes it's hard not to think "he/she doesnt't deserve him/her"|`|9lynZDFxaa	Yes.<br>  Why are u even asking this?<br>  Not everyone is shallow/
Rl9rLrQxaa	First off wow. I am soo sorry that happened to your mom. Second I honestly have no idea! I don't even know what I would do in that situation. I guess all you can do is just sit down and get everything out in the open. I do know that once you get this off your chest, you'll feel much better! :)|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would just sit down with her and tell her the truth. Tell her that you know and how you found out. I am sure that she will be very relieved that it is finally out in the open.|`|sD8vfP75aa	It might be hard. But just confront her. Find a time when it's quite between you two. Then gently bring it up. Start by saying "Mom I know this may be a hard subject for you but I think I may know who my father is." If this doesn't get her to open up. Come right out and tell her everything you know.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Have you sat down with your mom to ask what the story is? If she is not telling, I don't think you should tell her you know yet. Prod her a little. Tell her how you are curious and give her the option to tell you first.|`|SJPfjaS0aa	Thats a tough one. Well now that you're 16, you shuold definitely approach her one evening and ask about him. Tell her that you want to know more and whatever she has to say is ok. Mayb she has been waiting for the right time to tell you and she wasnt sure you were ready.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
2KDwEEj9aa	Yes! :)<br>  But it could make her get a bit emotional, don't make TOO a big deal out of it.|`|6FuP34Xnaa	oh yeah! That is a great idea! That is such a cool story, too: she made it through that hard struggle. i bet she'll love it. i knew i would if i was her. just make sure you tell how much you love her.:)|`|849568b9194a2884495b8cfb18d6e583aa	VERY ORIGINAL YOU ARE A GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER I LVE THE IDEA.....I AM SURE SHE WILL TOO MAKE SURE YOU TELL HER RENEA FROM TEXAS SAID GET WELL|`|JM1kBBGraa	yes thats cute and also give a big rose or mixed flower bouquet :)<br>  have fun and good luck!|`|Rf9eWfCvaa	That sounds like a great idea i'm sure your G-Ma would love it!|`|0a5e3ca6e627a0f07f1948ce4430d13eaa	yep|`|AA10500537	yes that would be nice|`|69fb08854a4e77f2b45550c526754d26aa	That sounds cute. I'm sure she would like that.|`|vcpboeNuaa	I think that's really a nice idea, just make sure she knows how much everyone missed her.  I think your grandma will be glad to be home as long as you are welcoming and kind t her.  She still might be tired and unsure of things, so just don't over stress her.  I'm sure she missed being at home!|`|Nr16Kjqgaa	I think that's a great idea! Not only is it sweet but it will let her know that you care about her and are thinking of her. That can make her feel better while she is recovering. ;)|`|31WiVpyHaa	yea! that is an awesome idea! nice creativity!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I think that's a lovely idea. You should do it!|`|4duANUkHaa	yes!|`|oojO4WAraa	She would love that.  It would make her smile.  Good idea.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	awhh.<br>  that sounds so cute.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	yes as i'm sure that she missed you badly too|`|R0iHHPqEaa	yep
19ea0ffe56f1755c71f275c227e7fe16aa	pray to God, i'm sure you do, and remember to be an exemplary role model for your kids.  mind what you say, what you do, and go about the divorce.  don't bad mouth your soon-to-be-ex to your kids, and be firm with them about texting him back and encourage your kids to talk with you all the time and to tell you their feelings.  remind them that everything is going to be OK and not to worry.  get your kids out of "the middle" as fast as you can and only you deal with your stupid husband.  your husband doesn't know how if's going to play out in the divorce court.  and you can rally for 100% custody b/c it's probably better off for the kids at this point in their lives.  get a really good lawyer with the stipulation that your husband has to pay for it.  that'll stop him in his shoes.  tell him he can pay alimony or he can pay for one hell of a fight.  he's better of with 8 years of alimony.  and he has his freedom with no kids around.  but honestly you will have to figure out what is best for you with a lawyer.  get a good one.  it pays in the end.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Take the cell phones away from your kids until the divorce is final.<br>  <br>  Your husband will definitely pay alimony and child support.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Sounds to me that you will be better off without him. Marriage shouldn't be about "putting up" with abuse - neither you nor the kids deserve to live this way. Hopefully, you will eventually meet a guy who can be a great husband to you and a good role model to your sons. You can get through it, be strong.|`|an1EMiFkaa	Your better off without him and in time all will be well :) <br>  Good luck.|`|0AShsMsoaa	your boys are at an age where they idolize their dad.  and they will even more.  they may want to live with him.  if the homeschooling and the divorce and the idea you have of no contact with him is your grand idea of hiding your boys from the world and reality, here is reality, sister, you are hurting them by doing that.  <br>  <br>  you are very very very lucky that he has a job.  a guy who makes 80k is NOT a deadbeat.  and you are delusional if you think he is.    i dont think you are grasping what is going on here.  men with responsible jobs dont up and leave without a compelling reason, especially with 2 sons who need him at home.     that leaves you. <br>  <br>  can i ask you a personal question?  are you part or all  of the problem here?  have you ever gotten professional and i dont mean christian, i mean professional marriage counseling?  i urge you to get some, even if you have to go alone.  there is part of the story you are not owning up to, the part where your husband leaves you.  that is the part that you are not admitting.  <br>  <br>  your boys are entering the part of their lives where they need an intact family and a present mother and father.  and, they need friends and to be part of the wider world.  the timing of this is terrible for them, you and your husband owe it to them to try to work it out.  if that means you grow up and make changes, then, that is what christians do, they do what is best.  in this case, it is what is best for the kids.  life is hard out there, have you heard?<br>  <br>  <br>  what is this? thumbs down?  i dont care, give me all you want, the truth speaks for itself.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Unfortunately, you can't stop your husband from contacting his boys.  However, you can have a mediation with your husband, and you can tell them what your husband is doing.  They will take appropriate action.  It sounds like you are going to have a battle with him.  Keep your faith and things will get better.  Your attorney will make sure you get what you are entitled to.|`|a6j0cwgqaa	I am so sorry for you! <br>  This man (if we can call him that) sounds horrible and shouldn't be allowed to talk to your children at all! What a waste of space!!!<br>  You need to change your kid's cell numbers and don't let him try to lie his way back into their lives! Its clear he is just talking to them to get out of child support!<br>  <br>  Keep going to church and have faith! the Lord will not leave you helpless! and can I tell you that I am so impressed that you home school your children! I was home schooled up to 6th grade and I'm so grateful my mom did things that way! You have proof you have been involved with your boys! does he? Justice will be served! <br>  <br>  I will pray for you! I sure hope you get things figured out! God bless you!|`|JF0SIngqaa	It is hard to divorce when you don't believe in it but if he was abusive than you are better off without him. He is using the children to find out what is going on in the home.

Go to your church, they will provide financial help and food.|`|fLU63N4kaa	Pray. Help yourself and God will help you.|`|RcpRW202aa	he needs to own up to his responsibilities.

No sense in letting them get hurt in the process of this divorce.  Change your kids phone numbers to their cells and tell them that your father is just confused and you will take care of it.  Then while divorcing this immature creep tell him that this is between you and him and to keep the kids out of it.  When you file for divorce and get the child support settled do not feel bad for taking what is rightfully theirs.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Your husband is talking out of his a**. He left you and your sons,,That is abandonment. And he has to pay child support and probably alimony, You really can't stop him from texting your son, he does have a right to see your kids and to talk to them. I'm sure your sons know that he is being a jerk and that they shouldn't believe too much of what he says. Hang in there and take care of yourself and boys, Better days are ahead.|`|yNi1adRqaa	Being a good Christian does not mean allowing yourself or your children to be abused. There is no God that would want that for you.You need to get legal help ASAP. They know what to do and will seek the proper orders preventing your husband from bringing your kids into this messy situation. Please do not bad mouth your kids father to them. It will not make you feel any better and they already know who and what their father is. Take the high road and be the better Christian person through this, but do not give up any of your rights. Family court was invented to sort these things out. You can share custody while still retaining physical custody and your kids are old enough to decide whether or not they will visit their father. This is a very difficult time for all of you, including your husband. Stay strong and take all things moderately by trying not to get angry over the dumb things that your husband says or does.<br>  Forgive him for his stupidity and let yourself get on with living a good life. Allow yourself to grieve on a daily basis if you need to, wallow for just ten minutes each time you wallow, then stop and get on with your day. Just keep telling yourself that this is not the worst thing that you have ever been through. My thoughts will be with you.
XFltp6ZEaa	tell him how awesome that other guy was in GRAPHIC detail. use diagrams if necessary.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	You can't do anything to convince him except to behave in a trustworthy manner from here on out.  More than likely, however, the relationship is over.  Once you break someone's trust so completely you can almost never get it back.<br>  <br>  My advice?  Move on.|`|GYiQEwIvaa	You just tell him back then I was so dumb and I really should kept hold of myself but now I know I really hurt your feelings and I'm so sorry.|`|B4ix1WkLaa	Well i guess every person gets mad and upset when cheated on right?<br>  But lets put ourselves in his shoes what if he cheated on you with some girl he liked in highschool and now he says he wont ever do it again? Would you honestly deep down believe him? Its hard to...now if he loves you he might be scared to follow his heart which is telling him to go back to you, but remember the mind is very strong and can sometimes take over...So give it time and keep showing him you only want to be with him. I wont say to forget about him and move on because i know its hard...I suggest you kkep trying and when you decide to move on do it.|`|JfzGFo7aaa	listen once a guy looses his trust for a girl there is little to no chance of regaining that takethat from me ill tell you what guys really think. <br>  <br>  Now everytime you do go out with your friends w out him what do u think is oing to be in the back of his mind.<br>  <br>  my advice if you wanna waste your time keep trying or jsut move on trust me|`|5BmnSiqUaa	.<br>  You can't.<br>  <br>  Sorry.<br>  .<br>  .<br>  Consider this:  A good number of rape victims lose their mates - even their husbands.<br>  .<br>  Why?<br>  .<br>  Fair or not, there's always the sneaking suspicion that she somehow encouraged the assault.<br>  <br>  .<br>  In your case, you were totally willing.<br>  <br>  .<br>  Sorry.<br>  .<br>  .|`|UG2z5rGIaa	well, toughie.. we all make mistakes<br>  <br>  really you could say anything to him. but its up to him and him only to choose to believe it.
ibeVcQyWaa	I think living together first is the way to go.  Nothing like realizing you are NOT compatible in any way AFTER you've said "til death do us part".  Men and commitment, I don't see how getting married or not is going to change that, he's either committed to you or he's not.  For the last part, I don't believe in marriage at all, so to me, it is nothing but a piece of paper.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	It depends on the couple. I am glad I have lived with my fiance. This way, our first few years as husband and wife will just be happy times (mostly) because we don't have to deal with the adjustment of living together. <br>  <br>  And to all the people who say that men don't ever get married to the girl they are living with because they are "getting the milk for free", they have obviously only met jerks, because my fiance proposed after 3 years of living together. Not all men are ***holes!!!|`|iQqsdl5yaa	Im not married but I would say living together first is the better way to go....you learn alot about your significant other but living with them...and I also do believe that marriage is merely a piece of paper.  I live with my boyfriend and consider him my "husband" even though we are not binded by a piece of paper...that paper proves nothing, it does make love stronger or anything.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Marriage is something that belongs between two people that are committed to a life together. I always thought it made the Lady's look cheap when they lived with a man not married. It says they are not into commitment and therefore could walk out at any time. I think a husband will treat his lady better if they are married but again, it has to do with each person. I wouldn't live together first, to me it takes away from the relationship|`|lckv4hs3aa	Well there's pro's and con's for both sides... There's no one option is better than the other. I personally would want to live with someone before marrying them because people are different when you live with them and it brings about new challenges and a chance to see how and if you can cope etc. for example, when ever i went round my boyfriends house, it was spotless, we moved in together and i found he was actually really messy and pretty lazy (leaves dirty plates in the bedroom), turned out he just cleaned before i arrived always. It's those little things that bug you and learning if you have similar views when it comes to handling money (in real life, not just talking about it). There's so much you learn. Everyone i know (married, divorced and single) also advise anyone to live together first. But hey that's our view. Just do what feels right. If you want to live with them then you do it!... live with them. Live for the present|`|bf6K6uubaa	this is a tough one...but i think the best answer is to have your own place...and stay over a lot...but you still have your own place so yesi ts more $$$ but you have somewhere to retreat to...you  need that division until you're ready for marriage...so then yeah he will still propse cause you're not living as already married..|`|HzVR8Wahaa	Well, some people don't approve of living together before you get married.  This was the case with both my husband and I's parents.  But, my husband and I basically spent every single night together (for at least 2 years) before we got married.  I'm so glad I did too, I learned so much about guys in this period!  I was SO naive before.  I learned so much about his past, his sexual behaviors, etc.  Some of it completely freaked me out but I'm glad I learned of this before we got married so I wasn't so shocked once we did start officially living together.|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	a marriage license is just that, a piece of paper, but it represents a commitment to be faithful to that one person and no one else.  Simply living together first is more like renting a car to see if you like the way it handles.  In my opinion, if the commitment isn't there to begin with, there is no need to live together because it is just for sex and if the commitment is, then there is no reason not to get married.|`|532XA7lkaa	Statistically speaking, I think it's better to wait until after marriage to move in together.  I lived with my husband of 5 years now, before marriage...about a year before we were married actually.  It was tough but I don't think it would have been any less tough with a marriage license, know what I mean?  It's an adjustment...married or not.|`|r3iKYom3aa	Evidence clearly indicates that people who cohabit prior to marriage have much higher likelihood of divorce. That is indisputable. <br>  <br>  Fornication is also sin.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	i would say before you two get married! the old saying goes you dont know a person until you live with them is true!|`|TdPBvgC2aa	No, get married first. there is no respect or commitment until MARRIED !

PpuU6CVNaa	Only time can tell, all of our experiances affect us in both negative and positive ways. It all depends on the way that he interprets the situation later on in his life. The best thing you can do is accept people the way they are and accept their past to the best of your ability. If this guy is right for you, he will make you happy regardless of everything else.|`|nJsTQ6xQaa	My though...creppy and gross|`|7UFta5tcaa	Sounds like a heck of a child hood to me.

T9TK229Saa	Just tell her that you love her and you understand the reason she doesn't want you to go is because she cares about you but also tell her that she raised you right and you know enough not to do something stupid. Your only intentions for prom are to hang out with your friends. If you complement her parenting and point out how responsible you are plus your intentions for the night, it should make her feel better. Make sure she has your number so she can contact you or you can call her and tell her when you get there and when you leave. Give her your friends names, and what your going to be doing at the prom. I know it sounds stupid but it's better to try than not to go at all. Good Luck :)|`|32zBW5uCaa	I would not allow my 14 year old to go to the prom.  There are too many things which could occur, that she is not emotionally mature enough to deal with.  Besides, if you wait for your Jr. prom, you will appreciate it much more, because it won't be just another annual dance.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	I would tell her theres going to be lots of adults there along with the trust she should have with you.<br>  Good luck.|`|GqplhsAcaa	I think you should prove to her that you will not do anything of that, such as tell her dangers that you know of about alcohol or something like that|`|CUl6PnUaaa	hah you know you just wanna go to get **** faced and make some babies after..
ygAkXSknaa	I donno. I have asked my husband about a million times why he choose to knock his ex up, while he cannot even stand her guts, and he said that he didn't think he could do any better. My answer was that being alone is better than being tied to an idiot, and he is speechless. Pisses me off, but cannot do anything about it, I love him, gotta suck it up.|`|AA10065812	??????????<br>  Well, the first problem is the number of single women trying to get knocked up, which has increased by 143% in 8 years, and 20%  of all sexually active girls age 12-18.  <br>  <br>  The second problem is how guys think that if they if they get their regular or live in girlfriend pregnant, they somehow have the same rights as a married man.  They don't except in California and Arizona.  <br>  <br>  Also, having oral sex, or using a condom does not work in cases where the female is intending to get pregnant, as is the case with 20% of sexually active girls age 12-18, according to a January Study.  If the girl is intending to get pregnant, they can take the semen and insert it into themselves.  The condom need not even been one used in them.  The cause behind the pregnancy is not a consideration in awarding child support.<br>  <br>  This was evident in a Michigan case is which a woman was awarded retroactive child support against a man that was 11 years old when she had sex with him.  She was 22 at the time.  At age 27, he was ordered to pay 15 years retroactive child support.  The statute of limitations on filing charges against her had run out.<br>  <br>  There's also the growing number of cases involving men, most active duty military, with child support orders on children that are not theirs.  In only 11 states can these orders be overturned.<br>  Provides Relief for Some Men <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinelawyersource.com/news/paternity-fraud.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinelawyersource.com/news/p...</a><br>  <br>  Of interest, single middle and upper income women are not getting pregnant outside a committed in nearly the numbers of low income.  They are simply better at the use of birth control.  As a cab driver, I often see women, dressed to the 9s, coming from the low income neighborhoods, with just enough money to pay for the cab and one drink at a night club in the upper income plaza.  At 4 A.M., I get a call to pick them up from some apartment building near the plaza to take them home.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I don't think women or men are intentionally trying to have a baby...usually.  They are just being lazy and stupid, not using birth control, condoms ...or you know...just not having sex would be the way to go lol. <br>  <br>  But when the big "oops" happens, they want to blame it on each other.  The guy thinks the girl was trying to "trap" him, and the girl is pissed that she has to "deal with the baby" so she wants his money.   Its a vicious cycle, but they forget the saying.  It takes two to tango right.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think the percentage of males who get women pregnant without marriage intentionally is exceedingly small.  Most are simply mentally lazy - they simply stupidly assume the woman is handling the birth control.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Guess what? Last time I looked it takes two to create a child? Women throw themselves at men and then expect them to walk away? Never happen!!! Lady's need to sit the standards when it comes to who jumps in bed with you!!!|`|WVcUweTEaa	Most guys are not looking to knock up chicks.  They are looking to get it wet by a chick who will be more then open.<br>  <br>  Those guys looking to knock up chicks...usually hang around and take care of his responsibilities.|`|cb76b5cf2e273e704d7f31195504dc33aa	They're only thinking of having sex, not knocking a chick up. Be serious... No guy has promiscuous sex with the intent of having a kid with the girl.|`|GXOy8rjqaa	My stepson and his girl had a baby in January (08)  then had another one in December (08).  He planned this and he is only 22.|`|uyX6VP2Yaa	bc these losers only care about pleasing themselves.<br>  my dad is one of those. my mom hasn't seen a single penny from that jerk!|`|djUMvICoaa	Too much thinking done with the wrong head.
65m62rDraa	Very carefully...(^:  She is your mom, and it sounds like she loves you very much. <br>  I am a mother who loves my kids dearly. I would be sad to see them move far away, but I would except the fact that they have a life of their own and they make their own choices. If you speak to her softly, lovingly, and explain you don't want to hurt her feelings, she should understand where you are coming from. Assure her that you will visit her when possible, and call her often. Who knows, maybe she will follow you to Arizona in the future... This is part of life...when the chicks open their wings and fly. As long as you can assure her you will be safe and happy, she will understand.|`|XbvQiEDxaa	may be dont'know you should thing your self|`|taBbKvRwaa	Just get  it done and over with.

AA11538662	Ok, I am a stepmom and am kinda distant with my stepdaughters because I am treated with less respect than their birth mom. Have ya been treating your stepmom in a way that makes her feel less accepted? Maybe calling her step grandma with the baby instead of grandma? <br>  <br>  Maybe if the above is not it, maybe she's depressed and could benefit from seeing a doctor. Or, maybe she is preoccupied with other things right now and she just don't realize she is appearing distant. Or maybe she is going through the change of life or maybe she is having marital issues and just don't know how to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, I wish your family luck figuring it out and congrats on the baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|B359bLqsaa	maybe she is having problems with her husband and is really stressed out.  maybe she is thinking of leaving him.  its possible that she knows she will lose you and everyone else, including that new baby, if she leaves because he is the one who is family and she is not.  it sounds like to me she is going thru something which is very hard for her.  if i were you, if you really care about her, i would take time out to spend with her and get to understand exactly what is going on with her.|`|cGbTJobeaa	During one of the visits when she is fine and chatting away, ask her about it in a very nice and loving way. She may need to be assured by you that even though she is step-mom to you, she will always be grandma to the baby.  The baby will know no difference between her and her bio-grandma. She'll be grandma...not step-grandma.  Also...some people just aren't good around babies, so don't take that personally.<br>  <br>  It's hard to be a step-mom because you're always keenly aware that you are not bio-mom and there's a hesitancy that comes with that fact. . It is hard to know sometimes what your role should be.  Bio mom and bio dad can be stern or say something negative and that's ok because the kids will always love their parents.  If step parent says the wrong thing, then the kids carry the negative comment longer than if the same thing were said by bio-parent.<br>  <br>  So, ask her.  It sounds like you have a good relationship with her. So she must have been a loving woman towards you. Talk to her about it in a loving way out of respect for the time and effort that she put forth in developing a good relationship with you while you were a bratty teenager...and you know you were. We all were horrible girls when we were in hs.|`|cLPimVR6aa	May be she just wants to have free times to her self. May be she is sick of you guys is time for your to let her be hereself and you guys need to stop pushing her.|`|AA11066099	Hi, why dont you ask her its probably nothing to do with you at all,maybe shes distracted for another reason.Ask her.x|`|Z5rIQE7Gaa	Maybe she is tired, maybe she isn't feeling well, maybe she feels the visits are more frequent than she would like.<br>  <br>  Maybe she doesn't have biological children of her own and feels sad about that. Maybe you offended her somehow and she is hurt.<br>  <br>  Maybe she is tired of cleaning the house before company.<br>  <br>  It could be all sorts of things. Maybe you could get an idea from your dad. You could ask him sometime how she is doing and maybe he will open up.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she works hard, maybe she just wants more time to herself on the weekends. You say your dad wants you to visit all the timel Maybe she and her dad used to do things together on weekends that she can't do when she has company.<br>  <br>  Maybe have fewer visits or shorter visits or ask her dad and her to visit you sometimes instead so she wouldn't always have to be the host.|`|fa0BCSzUaa	Maybe, this is just a theory, something happened in her mind when the new baby came into the family? Maybe it's a midlife crisis sort of thing and she just feels like she's getting older? People's minds work differently, and they do things that we can't comprehend or understand. I would talk to your dad about this actually. Don't confront her about it just yet. Talk to your dad and see what's going on first. He might say something to her about it too.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	she's been there for 15 years so i think you should talk to her and ask her what's wrong maybe a misunderstanding or something,,,but yea you should really talk to her..or maybe start with your dad|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Maybe she is having troubles in the bedroom.

You are lucky to have him in the absence of your parents.  He is only looking out for your safety.<br>  My parents nearly drove me to murder when I was you age...I think its quite natural.
6c77928b771d6a7239a325d3a698e58faa	The idea seems do-able, though there are a few rough spots that need to be thought out thoroughly. If the pouch is durable plastic, I think you might have some trouble making it large enough to hold a sufficient amount of water without making the shirt uncomfortable and bulgey. How about making a water bottle that's light, comfortable and can easily be attached to a shirt, shorts, or wrapped around the arm (like an ipod holder). Hope that helps.

You need to think about these things before you go any further with your feelings because if you go ahead now and something happens that hurts her she's not going to be mature enough to know how to deal with it.<br>  I would suggest you wait until she's a bit older when she'll be able to cope with relationship stuff and date girls your own age in the meantime.|`|kQf5TbUFaa	okay im going to say this slowly no cause love has no age limit okay i like a guy who is 16 and im 13 i know i guy who is dating  a girl who is 12 going on 13 who is 15 going 16|`|W618lfZ6aa	Too young to be dating period.|`|PDCVyN5eaa	no becuse im 15 and my boyfriend is 13 so its ok|`|11vkZiVsaa	that's kinda weird cause your in high school and shes just getting into middle school pretty much . i don't think it would be as weird if u were both in high school; but whatever age is just a number in the game of love (; lol if u really like her go for it.

Don't compromise your ideals.  If you have to change, you are with the wrong person.
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I can't imagine any problems with work, although they could be missing benefits. <br>  BUT I would find out how your friend & her husband actually filed her tax returns during the past three years - - it had to be either married filing jointly or married filing separately and if it isn't one of those two then her and her husband are committing tax fraud.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Seems like something my fiance's brother would do (he is 18, so is his gf). Partly because he owes child support, doesn't work, and only has SSI (which they can't garnish).|`|AA10018260	why are they hiding the marriage?  is one of them seeing someone else that the other one does't know about?  seems kinda weird that they would not want to share with everyone that they are married.|`|dHPA390Qaa	There are no benefits to being secretive, even filing married filing joint is a better status.<br>  what is the point?|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Why so secretive?  Are they publicly married to other people?|`|VqilAWDGaa	I don't see anything wrong with this.
52bb38389ace91aedab5837d20eb5996aa	you need to do things to take your mind off  him. go out make new friends or hang out with old ones. don't do all the things that you and him did and dont spend time thinking of him. this is also a great time to make sure your in the right place with God. He is always there for you|`|AU3HVTToaa	delete his number|`|pzMupFBxaa	pursue a new hobby.|`|ytrfOGKoaa	go find a nice boy who looks better and get with him^^|`|37BgyLkFaa	according to my ex it would be pull a 14 yearold (she's 18) <br>  id say go out, have fun, go to partys and stuff, go to places where boys are likely to be, find a new boy to like, and this time act upon your feelings. although tbh, if you hav only liked him 2 months, and ur likeing him less now, then there shouldnt be much of a problem|`|UHR5yi9iaa	Your question is a bit confusing! but anyway the best way is to take you mind of things and get yourself another lad have a flirt nout wrong in that! Or just have a big girly time with films and chocolate with your best mates - can't beat it when you want to take your mind of things|`|ZCO6n8EYaa	find someone else ;)|`|PeNTl6KOaa	find anova lad :P|`|lK3TXGBOaa	im in the same situation.... i recently broke up wiht my ex and what i did was delete his no. erase all hist txt messages everything...it sucks because i cant really move on its been a month that we havent talked and yeah i miss him sometimes but i try to go out with my friends and have fun, go to the movies, hobby etc. you know sometimes i wish i wouldve never met my ex because he hurt me alot......
6odO4PK0aa	My Brother has problem with pot. The Best thing you can do is tell them you don't like them doing that and don't hang out with them when they are  smoking. Be there when they need you and don't help them get it!  the last thing you want to do is push them away!  <br>    That's all you can do until they are what help quiting.
iRZ4Y2bLaa	Ok.<br>  <br>  First of: Stop having sex with all these girls. Sex is supposed to be meaningful, sleeping around just doesn't make you the boy next door. females talk and when one girl knows that you slept with someone they all know, trust me everyone knows.<br>  <br>  Second: You like this girl, she may like you too. Just take it easy, get to know her. Show here or anyone that you like how much you like them by giving them signals. Trust me we can pick up on it. Make comments on how she looks, make comments about her features. Ask her if she would like to hang out with you, not a date.<br>  <br>  Take your time. If you really want to find someone that you will be with for a while.<br>  <br>  Best of wishes!|`|MV4QN2maaa	Maybe the girls you aren't attracted to just don't measure up to your girlfriend in your mind. If you can't get back with her somebody will come along but you can't always be thinking about your ex.|`|9hnNDNdGaa	ur not my type... prob not any1 else's type either.. ur freaking me out no offense :'(<br>  <br>  but plz answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtOT_fRABIV7o.sp..q054Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309124801AAy62V8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Maybe you are still in love?|`|svdZrJfbaa	this might kind sound of strange but maybe the reason you can't find another girl is because you're meant for your ex. is she dating anyone knew? maybe you two are supposed to be together since it won't work out with anyone else.
K2dv9u7baa	Yes you did the right thing, explain to your 3 year old cousin that you protected her <br>  And it was very nice and sweet of you to protect her <br>  Good luck :)|`|kV2uiCAAaa	Ha ha! Good for you! Not only did you protect your cousin, but that kid will probably think twice before doign that to anybody else. If you ask me, today there are way to many people who just let themselves get walked on. Now i'm not saying to go and beat up anybody who looks at you funny, but there IS a time to to react when enough is enough...you my friend did just that! Bravo!|`|fnytzXWTaa	You did the right thing, just remember to tell your cousin that you were protecting her. So, shes not punching random people in the face. Good for you!!!|`|jjV0aikbaa	OH YOU AGAIN, joeyslggr <br>  <br>  THIS IS GETTING CREEPY! A NEW ACCOUNT W/ THE SAME QUESTIONS ABOUT A 3YR OLD COUSIN. ARE YOU A PERV OR A TROLL? WHY DO YOU HAVE 2 ACCOUNTS???|`|8pS0oT4faa	yes you did the right thing, you should have also stomped the @#$% out of that other kid later on. Good job!|`|9120dc418a017a1bdb6aae2ce3dfc8caaa	I think you did the right thing!
xtKEToLHaa	No, never.<br>  <br>  I am not easy either...|`|4EWCegiRaa	1)  Maybe it's more of an emotional connection since my girlfriend obviously isn't "in-tune" with me anymore<br>  2)  I wouldn't hook up with anyone "because they are easy".  <br>  --->3)  I wouldn't cheat.|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	no, I have standands.|`|nEKpYuVHaa	yes
4xAOZXwNaa	Wow I'm gonna erase everything i just wrote because I just realized that you asked if you should date again lol.. i thought you were asking something else. But yes i think you should date again. Just because one relationship went wrong doesn't mean every other one is gonna be like that. You really shouldn't let that one stupid guy get in the way of other better ones and the upcoming future. I'm sure you will find a nice guy soon that will treat you well, til then just live life and have fun!. :)|`|ovrPxkRMaa	You should date. You'd be surprised to see how few men are like scum. Just because you date doesn't mean you are boyfreind/girlfriend with someone. Dating is a way of getting to know people.<br>  Good Luck|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Yes, it was his loss.<br>  <br>  If you want to date, date.  Just make sure you aren't "rebounding" on some poor guy that has no clue you are using him to make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  It really depends on how long you dated the previous guy, and how deep you were.  I always waited a while before dating if the girl and I were really deep.  If it was a shallow relationship, I didn't bother waiting.<br>  <br>  If your head and heart is clear, start dating now.
pBnO8rDcaa	ha ha don't ask me...i got a bunny for my b-day a few years back, and my dad let my bunny go on purpose when my mom and I weren't home...it took a while before i finally figured out the truth..my dad had opened the cage so that my bunny would get out..I still don't know why my dad did that!|`|OSF2WMQeaa	HAHAHAHA!|`|NOcbfa8xaa	buy it<br>  and tell him "its already here, why get rid of it now " :)|`|GqplhsAcaa	prove to him that you know how to take care of one and that you can do it|`|U4QBalnEaa	Say that if u had a bunny it would make ur dad rich XD
A0fZTWO0aa	why dont you talk about food and restraunts and find a restraunt you and her both like and you should say "hey how bout i take you for dinner or lunch on friday or something. "
a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	It might be but not necessarily is.<br>  Though your MOM shouldn't have been spanking your brothers ... that is a dad's dastardly duty.<br>  .<br>  A lot depends on whether you (and they) experience parental love and affection 24/7/365. And whether they (teens) are FORCED to accept a spanking or just reluctantly accept it rather than experience "the last resort [being grounded]".<br>  .<br>  You say you "hate spanking". Well, most of us hate "being spanked". If you so "hate spanking", then don't spank.<br>  .|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	depends on how you define spanking.  Parents have the right to discipline their kids as long as they know what they're doing and their judgments 100% not under any influence.  I don't think any parents would like to kill their own kids after going through all of the painful and suffering to have them.|`|N7gOE1btaa	That is a very tricky question, and it depends on where you live and the laws in that area.  Generally speaking though, spanking is not permitted.  But keep in mind, unless you parents are really physically causing you pain or harm, then its probably not that big a deal.  I know it sucks to be spanked, but if its just to punish you for being rude or some other bad behaviour, then maybe you should stop with the bad behaviour :p<br>  But in all seriousness, reporting spanking to authorities will cause tons of stress on your family and you could be taken away by child services.  If you feel that the spanking is serious, frequent, over-the-top, very painful, or bordering abusive, then maybe you need to speak to a teach or guidance counsellor about your options regarding this matter.|`|2bkV73gpaa	No, not necessarily. But it could depend on the situation, the severity or the frequentness. And as Ryan said, it could also depend on the laws of where you live.<br>  <br>  But wait a minute. Your FRIEND spanked your older brothers and sisters? Why is your FRIEND spanking your siblings?<br>  <br>  I'm not in favor of spanking kids but I was spanked occasionally while growing up.<br>  <br>  Are you opposed to spanking period? If so, that's OK and good. But seriously. Why should the girl's age matter? Or a boy's age. Would it be OK if you were 10 instead of 12? Or what if she was a little older?<br>  <br>  When I was 12, my grandmother spanked me in a fitting room because I told my 5-year old cousin to turn the F around and close his #$%&ing eyes while I was embarrassed standing there topless while being fitted for a training bra.<br>  <br>  The year before that, my 5th grade substitute (female) teacher spanked me for my telling an annoying boy who was bugging me in class to F off (ok, I also hit him too and called him a #$%&ing mariposa).<br>  <br>  I was #$%&ing embarrassed as hell on those occasions and others but I didn't feel that I was being abused.<br>  <br>  It's also way more embarrassing to be spanked when you're older, especially when in happens to you in front of other kids your age or younger. Did you witness your older siblings spankings? Perhaps they were purposely spanked in front of you.<br>  <br>  Although I oppose spanking kids and wouldn't spank them if I have kids later, as long as kids are being fair and punishing them evenly without showing favortism to their sex (too often, girls are spanked and boys aren't, this is especially with older kids) and without physical hurting them, I have to honestly say spankings shouldn't be too big a deal.<br>  <br>  Also, I guess technically you're not ''too old'' to be spanked until you're an adult. Sometimes not even then.<br>  <br>  One of my girlfriends once wrote a paper on corporal punishment in U.S. schools and found that an 18-year old high school senior teenage girl in Texas a few years ago was made to bend over and embarrass herself for a paddling even though she was technically an adult. I believe she lost a lawsuit against the male principal who spanked her. And all she did was smoke a cigarette (which she shouldn't have done, but still!). What was unfair was that she was a cheerleader and guys on the football who were caught smoking weren't paddled. I guess that pervert principal had his preference over who he wanted to spank or not. He even purposely delayed her spanking several days (when she was wearing pants) until calling her to the office on a day on which she was wearing a very short skirt! Hence her embarrassment when she was told to bend over in front of that creep and another male school official who was required to ''witness'' the punishment.<br>  <br>  Less than a year ago, a #$%&ing sicko, wacko, perverted judge in Texas, Gustavo “Gus” Garza, ordered the stepfather of a teenage girl to have her stick her bottom up in the air and then paddle it in full view of the judge and everyone in the courtroom or face some stupid fine.<br>  <br>  The girl, 14-year old girl, Josie Vasquez, wound up feeling completely humiliated and although her parents later sued, the courts upheld the court-ordered spanking.<br>  <br>  The girl's mother, Mary Vasquez, stated in her affidavit that the public paddling caused her daughter to "suffer not only physical pain, but also caused her to be frightened, degraded, shamed and embarrassed." <br>  <br>  (see Ft. Worth Star-Telegram article)<br>  <br>  There was also a case in Ohio in which another sicko judge ruled that a male adult guardian/babysitter could legally pull down a tennage girl's panties and spank her bare bottom! (see Cincinnati Enquirer article below)|`|EolGjge1aa	Spanking = Swatting the child's behind when they act up<br>  <br>  Abuse = Beating them to a pulp or hitting them for no good reason (or a small stupid reason)<br>  <br>  Simple so no it isn't abuse.

2gb6zN1raa	People seem to think that when they 'love someone' they should logically 'be with them' but as Tina Turner used to yell .. Whats love got to do with it ? ....<br>  <br>  As you get older you start to realise that all that glitters is not gold no matter how attracted or smitten you are by them ..they simply are not worth the hassle.. becasue you are young and curious you will not listen to warnings cus women have this idea that they can'fix guys' or 'make them love them and be great loyal guys' ..sadly it doesnt work like that out side of the fantasy.<br>  <br>  Usually a guy that is a player and gets through relationships like water has some issues or is just self satisfying and doesnt care who he uses for gratification along the way.<br>  <br>  When you have ignored enought warnings, and been confused and hurt and disillusioned enough times - youll spot idiots like this a mile off and walk away - sadly though until you have warn yourself out emotionally finding this lesson out - you just go head long into it.<br>  <br>  The choice is of course goingto be yours what ever you have asked on here - you will go ahead ..but, learn from what happens instead of repeating the mistake ok.<br>  <br>  Plus if you get involved, please use condom as viruses such as HPV have no symptoms in men or women but can cause infertility and cervical cancer. Please be careful.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	You have two choices. Take a chance on being "next" and get in the line of all those who have gone there before you.

I guess everyone thinks they will be the one who can reform him. NOT!!  Players cannot be reformed. And if by some chance you manage to make him think you are the one and only, he will eventually stray because he knows how, and it's so easy.|`|eQENZXz1aa	and when your the girl hes dating he will be telling another girl shes "next" if you think your going to be the one he does not do that to your dreaming|`|jfiF9XIUaa	I advise you go back and read what you just wrote!!!!!   everyone knows about it saying im gonna be 'next' after this girl hes dating at the moment.  WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE THE NEXT GIRL!!

If you don't want to get hurt, forget him. He's NOT sweet and he DOESN'T care about anyone but himself.

lvOR401haa	I have been there on vacation - so I don't know of anything myself.But I can suggest types of places to look for :-)<br>  <br>  Check out your local zoos and arboretums/botanical gardens.<br>  <br>  I know that some of these places can be free of entry or small entry fees and have some amazing gardens (I say zoos as some have little botanical garden bits).  Because they tend to have different species of plants etc, they will cater for all kinds of photos - tropical and local greenery.<br>  <br>  Also, if the weather is not good, you may get an outdoor feel inside too.<br>  <br>  Just an idea.<br>  <br>  Have a good wedding xx
AA10873763	The only possible reasons you would have to inform them are if you have health insurance and want to add him to your policy, and if you change your income tax withholding (W-4) form.<br>  Other than that, it's none of their concern.<br>  I assume you already have him listed as your emergency contact person.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You don't have to let them know unless you want to add your husband to your health insurance or change the way your work withholds taxes (neither of which you HAVE to do). You already said that your name is not changing, so that's not a concern either.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	For tax purposes and spousal benefits, you should advise your employer of a change in marital status.|`|SovaFpN8aa	The most specific reason to notify your employer, is because it will affect the with-holdings from your payroll.

Just go to the HR rep and tell them you have a status change.  Simple.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Only reason I can think of would be if you or your spouse has health insurance that would cover the other spouse. Congratulation on your future marriage plans. Have a nice day.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Well, usually you have to at some point for tax reasons. Why would you care if they know anyway? Its better for you in most cases. For example, if they have to lay off someone, and it comes down to you and a single person, and you have similar skills and both do a good job. They are more likely to keep the married person. Right?|`|GXOy8rjqaa	I didn't tell my employer for several years that I was married.

Otherwise, the do not need to know.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	You will need to update your benefits (status/beneficiary) and you tax withholdings.

So they would probably have darker hair and fairer skin. Maybe the possibility of blue eyes but again, dark eyes are the dominant gene.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	I think the asian part is more dominant.

So no, the kid will most likely have black hair and eyes.  However, the kid will also carry the recessive gene for red hair, so if your kid got with someone else that had the red hair gene, then it could happen.<br>  <br>  So if there is another asain out there with a recessive red hair gene, and that person got with your kid, they could have an asain look, with natural red hair.<br>  <br>  Most likely your hair color genes are BB for Black and Black from your mom and dad.  For your girl to have red hair she would need two red hair genes, so she's rr.  This would mean your kid will most likely be Br for black and red, with black being dominant.<br>  But if your kid gets with a blonde, or a red head, and happens to pass on the recessive r rather than the dominant B, then you could have a ginger grandkid.|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	Might be a cool mix. It's hard to say.|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	Genetically, red hair in the Asian genome is not unheard of.  Basically, what I am saying is that your kids could be asian ginger kids-kind of different.   <br>  <br>  Some even point out that Genghis khan may have been a ginger.  (sort of reddish hair but not like the way you picture the irish redheads - does that make sense?)  <br>  <br>  Koreans today are more like each other genetically today than in the past, but in the not to distant past there was more mid asian steppe blood in the culture.  Basically, I'm talking about the barbarians who would invade, wreck havoc for a few years and then slowly integrate or leave.|`|rBATSpC5aa	Asians [FULL asians, not half-asians]can't have ginger babies.<br>  They don't carry the gene, and it needs 2 [since it's recessive]<br>  <br>  I don't know why, but they can't.<br>  <br>  Is your girlfriend whtie? Because then it would basically be a white/asian baby.<br>  <br>  But i mean, there can be black gingers, or whatever. So i'm just guessing.|`|r9yowD2Iaa	I'm half asian and I have grey eyes and dark brown hair.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you'd be a lot happier if you just started acting assertively and doing what you want.  If he starts following you in the kitchen, make him start peeling potatoes or whatever needs to be done.  If you want to go out with friends, pat him on the arm and say, "You'll be just fine," and go.  If you getting assertive makes him unbearably unhappy, that's his problem, not yours - he can go to therapy if he feels that badly.|`|wKzH60Xlaa	....Chandler...., is that you?|`|B359bLqsaa	your angry because your goals are different.  You want him to have the same goal you have but he does not.  Actually, you should not be angry with him for that.  If he didn't agree to working towards this savings account then you really should not hold him responsible since he is not doing it.  And, if he only wants to work 30 hours a week that is his choice and he really should be allowed to make it.  Some people like to work alot, and some do not, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Now, if he promised to work longer hours and then broke his promise that is different.  <br>  <br>  it sounds to me that you place way more importance on the financial aspect and he places more importance on the relationship.  I think you should accept him as he is, I mean it sounds like he really loves you.  If you divorce  him, not only will you not have his income anymore, but you will lose someone who really cares about  you.|`|7eeeda9da85f22097325c1be6cef044baa	I know how you feel.

The reason you probably don't desire sex with him is because of his childishness.  I think you should tell him that his behavior is jeopardizing your feelings for him, even if he gets mad.  You should tell him, you want the security of a savings account, because if anything happened where you got sick, he can't make it on his own.  And I think you should tell him that you would have a lot more respect for him if he would pull his fair share of the load.

Second call him, squash this situation, as awkward as it is for him and you, it must be hell for the circle of friends.  The two of you have moved on, since you have to be around one another on occasion, set ground rules.  Let the bitterness go, it takes to much energy.|`|Lu8XFfNUaa	I would say to stay away from him. You're friends should not be telling you every move he makes as that makes it tougher to let go.|`|Krv4z6VEaa	I have some experience in this area. Been there, did that, done that! Go to GuyFinley.com and start reading. Here r some of his quotes that I have posted on my computer desk where I can see them everyday.<br>  <br>   "Letting go is the out-breath of the universe. It is part of a natural cycle conected to a greater whole, where the ending of anything already has a new beginning built into it. And just as we must expel a breath before we draw in the new air that revitalizes our physical system, so too we must learn to let go of whatever compromises the natural wholeness of our Original Self if we wish to realize its native spiritual contentment." End Quote<br>  <br>  "Whenever unhappiness lingers on - so much so that we start believing darkness has won the day - we may find new strength to start life over in this bright truth: the only cause for our continuing sense of feeling so bound and restricted is that we have agreed - w/o knowing it - to live in a world smaller than is our potential to let go of whatever may be limiting us." End Quote<br>  <br>  "It is said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder," but this truth tells only half the story. For whenever we see something of beauty - and take into ourselves that loveliness - we ourselves are transformed into something now made beautiful. And so it is with any state of being to which we give our attention!" End Quote<br>  <br>  "See the ocean: it does not run after its own waves, as it knows they must return to rest in her depths. And so it is for us: whether we speak of joy, peace, strength, or love itself - no greater illusion exists than that we should somehow find, searching ourside of ourselves, the Source of our True Self." End Quote<br>  <br>  "If we will only work to remember that we live in a world within which there are an infinite number of stories unfolding - all at the same time - then we will never forget that it is our choice as to which of these stories we live in." End Quote<br>  <br>  Itz over and done w/. U don't have to forget, but u must forgive people that wrong u if u wish to be a spiritually content individual. Anger feels good and itz a power trip. BUT - forgiveness is a state of mind that mature people adopt. Guy Finley has a lot of really great info and advice on anger, forgiveness, jealousy, and many other topics. Another great website for love, sex, and relationship articles is CaliforniaPsychics.com.

AA10696571	You have to consider a lot of things. More than anything, before deciding to have sex, you have to make sure that you are ready—physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, socially, and financially.<br>  <br>  Physically, you have to consider your age (are you too young to have sex?). You also have to consider your period (is it regular? Irregular?). I suggest you visit your gynecologist for advice. Your doctor will also be able to advise you on the best methods to avoid pregnancy and STDs.<br>  <br>  Mentally—are YOU ready to do it? For me, the fact that you have qualms about doing it means that you're not. You also have to make sure that having sex will not, in any way, affect the way you feel about yourself, at least, not negatively. For example, some women/girls think/feel less of themselves after "giving away" their virginity. If you think you will feel that way, then no, it's not the time for you to do it.<br>  <br>  Emotionally, sex should be fulfilling for both partners. If you think sex will be anything other than fulfilling, you shouldn't do it. You have to thoroughly evaluate why yourself. Is it really because you love your boyfriend, or is it because you're afraid of displeasing him?<br>  <br>  If you're a spiritual person, you should seriously consider this. This is self-explanatory. Socially, you have to consider what your family (which you do now) and your friends will feel/think if they knew you're doing it. If you believe that they will be disappointed, believe me, your loved ones' disappointment is even worse than their anger.<br>  <br>  Finally, in a worst case scenario, you'd get pregnant, how will you deal with it? Do you and your boyfriend have enough to support yourselves and your baby?<br>  <br>  If you answered negatively to any of these questions, then it's not yet time for you to have sex with your boyfriend. Tell him so and explain your reasons to him. If he truly loves you and respects you, he will respect your decision, too, and will wait for you to be ready.<br>  <br>  Think about this: if you have sex now and you decide not to have sex again later, you would already have lost your virginity and there's nothing you can do about it. You don't have a choice anymore... But if you decide to wait until you know you're truly ready, you always have the choice.<br>  <br>  I am a not the most devout christian and although I do believe in the sanctity of marriage, I'm afraid I had pre-marital sex. I did it for all the wrong reasons. Now I'm happily married. And although I'm happy that my husband accepts me for who I am, I still wish I had waited for him. It would have been the best gift I could have given him of me.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	Sex is a rough question to answer.  Also your age should take a factor.  If he is trying to force you to do it (constantly asking for it and being rude and or grumpy when you say no)  Don't.  I could fake being nice for a girl for a few months if that was what i was after.  Honestly though,  Educate yourself about it though.  Do some research.  And its not up to me to tell you what to do but when you do wait its well worth it.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	What is a long time? Save yourself if you can. If he does respect you like you say he will understand. Never feel pressured to have sex.<br>  It also doesn't matter the race thing. Any guy would want to be with you after so long. It's only natural, but I hope you save yourself for marriage.|`|PgDR15hsaa	Don't do it.  In my opinion a guy that wants to have sex before marriage isn't aware of the consequences.  <br>  If you feel guilty you're gonna regret it later!!|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Tell him that the women in your family don't have sex until mar rage and ask him to respect your wishes in this.<br>     If he won't then you have learned a great deal about him and may need to review you relationship with him.<br>   No one has the right to force their will on others|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Gaby,<br>  <br>  If a long time relationship isn't a year or more . . . if your not 19 and getting ready for college . . . you should talk to a trusted older female friend.

VH72aaLZaa	Just tried giving my bf a piggyback ride yesterday night.  I was reluctant but he wanted me to try so badly... that I finally did!<br>  <br>  And it was really funny, I'm stronger than I thought, I could keep him on my back for around 6 minutes, even running for a few seconds.  Must admit I struggled like hell at the end but I kept on walking!<br>  <br>  It made me feel... strong and in control! And sexy too because I could feel something become hard on my back!  I'm actually very proud I could do it, I was afraid I'd collapse right away...|`|R1HiVgBSaa	lol. im a guy. girls dont usually do that to me but that seems pretty embarrassing. lol. you must be pretty strong if you can lift that many guys up. lol|`|AA10847292	i"ve only had my bf sit on my lap once but it was a joke thing for my birthday.

And she's being a pervert about it?  Using you for a sexual experience when you're not consenting?<br>  <br>  That's what it really boils down to.  She's using you to get off without your consent.  <br>  <br>  Dump her.  This is just too creepy!|`|AA11092803	maybe you've got a beautiful sexy voice|`|Cvlf7arlaa	cause she likes your voice.|`|f280030b5c3fd08f70ea29f8d59505d5aa	you guys that are answering are way to closed minded except for the guy who said phone sex.yes, that is what it is called, and it means you both are supposed to do stuff, like youve never done it! please! if you havent wow wow wow. but really. you need to tell her to just tone it down because your not in the mood if your really that paranoid, every guy ive had always wants that! so i dont know what your deal is! loll, jk but yeah, just tell her it makes you uncomfortable, maybe through email, or textt (:|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	This bothers you?  You gotta be kidding.  She likes the sound of your voice and wants to get off listening to you talk.  Help her out ..encourage her.|`|maTLfzi8aa	She probably wants to hear your voice while she is masturbating cause she is fantasizing the 2 of you getting it on|`|uhRKCb9kaa	Because you maybe didn,t satisfy her saxually|`|F4HSSPVBaa	you guys are mean...he doesn't need unnecessary comments.<br>  maybe you're voice turns her on or maybe she wants to have sex with you|`|5ptkqtAgaa	odd question. but she is probably a very horny girl.|`|Sn4zj9T3aa	ummm....wow you should dump her so she can find a guy who likes sex as much as she does. sap.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	horny slut that is weird|`|umBHmupPaa	that could be considered a good thing, depending on how sexual you are. If you have not experienced that before, it will make you uncomfortable, but if it makes her happy, you should try enjoying it with her. she might appreciate it. If this is someone you plan to be with for a long time, you will also come to appreciate a woman like that!|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	Why would that make you uncomfortable? Guys love hearing a girl come, fact of life. If you are finding it uncomfortable maybe there is something wrong with you, nothing wrong with her. Masturbation is normal and I don't see why you (a guy) would have any problem with that!! You are the weird one pal.|`|pfWaYwYsaa	She does it cuz she finds you incredibly sexy and that she can express herself with you. She wants you to join in too. Now if you arent ready for that kind of relationship you need to either tell her or break it off. Choose one but don't suffer in silence.|`|oyx6DbJcaa	She really finds you attractive and you clearly turn her on.  It might be nicer for the both of you if you also masturbate with her together.  That's pretty hot, and very safe!  As long as you have privacy, that is.  Close the door.|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	well its ok to do once i a while but every time thats kinda weird... why dont you join her ask her next time you talk to her if she wants to have phone sex and you can masterbate with her talk sexual to her as you both masterbate|`|LtP7oOtraa	maybe your voice turns her on, you could talk to her about it. or have phone sex, then she could have hers and so could you, then you could get back to your normal conversation.|`|WJIuXTEcaa	Well woow. This sucks. I guess u turen the girl on :)<br>  And she probaly gets mad cause she probaly feels you don't like itt.

Hope I helpd|`|9qpvOu17aa	that's weird if you're not even talking about anything sexual lol<br>  i guess shes horny :P|`|EKRyIAF2aa	Just tell her the truth that she makes you nervous.

Maybe she wants to have phone sex with you.|`|x3TR3nj0aa	uhmm thats a little strange...<br>  idk, but i would probably not say anything if a guy did that to me.|`|5zSAPU52aa	first off she is a very horny dumb as hell ****!!!!!!  second your voices turns her on DUH!!|`|fQ881MwBaa	dude, just go give her your dong everyonce in a while. if you dont, its gonna be MY dong.|`|8NBEu5WNaa	LOL!<br>  <br>  XD|`|0WYCfpDHaa	she wants on|`|7z9eKO2maa	because she's a slut. sorry.|`|5OEIftHjaa	next time she starts masturbating get a book on quantum mechanics and start reading it to her, periodically exclaiming "isnt this fascinating?"|`|bnRKolhuaa	Get a new girlfriend if you don't like it.

That's just awkward.
poZRKtQvaa	You say you trust the two of them, but the fact that you took your time to ask this question means you don't.  The fact that you live in two different cities and they are living so close to each other is not a good situation.  If he misses you, he could find comfort in your friend, and that could lead to more.  The fact that you have told him you are not comfortable with the situation, and yet he still seems to hang out with this friend, might mean that he doesn't care enough about your feelings to change.  Or it could mean he cares too much about this other girl to respect your feelings about the situation.|`|dDa5ITB5aa	Talk to your girl friend, and ask her what is going on.<br>  Tell your boyfriend, that you want time alone to spend with him, and to stop inviting people when he goes to see you.<br>  Also, Remind your boyfriend, that he's dating someone, and to stop flirting.|`|bnRKolhuaa	It doesn't sound confusing at all, you are in denial, move on forget about him and what kind of friend is she. Get a boyfriend close to home and stop introducing unless you are playing cupid!|`|Y4NoOBslaa	you should talk to him about how you feel and what you think!|`|XjWFht6naa	tell other people do tell u if they do anything|`|1TSMdgG1aa	Let me tell you one thing....and I say it because I went through it. <br>  <br>  A guy cannot have a female "best friend" and a girlfriend too.  That is basically the guy's sorry excuse for having two girls at the same time, period.<br>  <br>  So please sweetie, just walk away from this.  Otherwise, you're gonna get really hurt, and he's not worth the bother.  Neither is she, that's a bad friend.  You deserve better friends, and a better guy.  Simply move on, you'll find someone better.|`|58fb6275b2690c997be88cb08cd6948daa	You're not confused hon, you're just wanting someone to tell you he's NOT cheating on you but you already know he is. You may not have "evidence or proof" as you put it but I think a woman knows when something isn't right. Kick is butt to the curb before your heart gets crushed.|`|guvgG8tRaa	well i know if you add it all up it could sound bad, but keep your eyes open to the big picture, if all this happened over a large time span then its not that bad but do keep this in mind- no matter how much you might want to say "he's different" pretty much every guy is weak and will have their moments. long distance relationships are tough. try to see yourself as the "hot girl". have some confidence in yourself and your relationship, but at the same time you should prepare(not expect it, just be ready for it) for the worst, this way you can mentally be prepared. also keep in mind there is no rush in finding "the one" so if it doesnt work, dont try to make it- relationships may require some work when its tough, but enough is enough. just be smart, and have fun.....basically its too soon to jump to conclusions.|`|iTWfab0baa	Well........i don't know what to say! Maybe you should try surprising your boyfriend by coming over to his place and you can see for yourself what he's doing. If he's with your friend then you know something is going on but if he acts as if nothing is wrong and that he's not covering anything up...just believe him. But if that doesn't work, you should try to talk to your friend. Has she been acting different around you? Try to find out whats going on through your friend....Hope that helps! =)|`|H5qJPekAaa	Maybe talk to them each individually and ask them what is up? Also tell each of them that you feel like their hiding something from you and that you feel like their doing something behind your back. What pisses me off is that your boyfriend did was that he asked that girl to come along to see you for valentines day. That is just messed up you and your boyfriend should of had alone time on that day. She also should of realized that when he asked her and said no and that you two should be alone. But your boyfriend should of realized to not have asked her in the first place. So maybe even bring that up. But don't talk about it to them in a harsh tone bring it on easy. I know it sounds easier than it is. But that is the only sure way to get things settled. I hoped that I helped in some way. If you have any more questions just e-mail me at stina51093@msn.com|`|bSHhWXfPaa	wtf? cheating much? maybe he is cheating on you. But, if your friend was an actual TRUE friend she wouldnt act that way towards him or you. ya know? so maybe if things don't work out, B-R-E-A-K-U-P! better fishes outthere ya know. nicer, sweeter, or even hawter guys out there! :) fishes=guys! :) HAHA. so, if you break up then idk what you'll do with your friend. if you guys arent best friends then maybe you can change and hang out with other friends you think would be better with you, and are nicer friends. then you can make new best friends. BUt if seh was already your best friend or if you still consider her as your best friend, then talk it thorugh wit her. dont scream or yell, that would totally ruin your friendship with her. speaking it through would maybe help. Or maybe talk to him about it. well, hope that help girl.|`|h6umWbzhaa	I would confront him. ask him straight out. if he hesitates, acts defensive, looks down, etc. then there is. if he denies it and it sounds believable, give a month or two and if he's still acting that way its time to dump him.<br>  i hope you work things out!|`|RSbn5STjaa	Sounds like you're out, she's in.  Confront them separately and then together.|`|bglr4m0Naa	It sounds like he is cheating!!!|`|MdQZDQcraa	isn't better if u dumb him then him breaking up with u? i'm sorry but the way u say it, he has already had it with her, i'm really sorry but i mean there are all those other great guys that want u because of who u r and don't want other girls!|`|VVH1KWaaaa	don't let your imagination run wild. just because he is an idiot doesn't mean he is cheating on you.|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	Well, the first rule of a relationship is having trust in the other partner.  That being said, it does appear that your friend and b/f are a little too "close" for comfort.  Honestly, I would confront him:  just tell it like it is.  Worse case scenario is he might be cheating... but think about it like this: if he IS then you can break up with him.  That does sound like a no brainer, but it is way better than worrying.  Just sit down with him and ask him strait up what the story is between him and your friend.  Good luck :)|`|54OjRZm8aa	It sounds like they both like each other and if she likes him enough she's not going to tell you what's going on.<br>  I would just tell him your done with the sneakyness(new word) and hopefully he will tell you the truth or maybe he will say it's not like that please don't leave. He could JUST be friends but I doubt it with the tickeling and same apt complex that sneaky leave his sneaky ***!|`|AA11294554	Women have this thing called "intuition". I think you have already figured this situation out and you're looking for your thoughts to be confirmed. He is into the girl. She is into him. They may already be seeing each other. If not - they will be. Sorry honey...time to move on. I have great intuition. Goodluck to you - find a one woman man!|`|DUr8KP94aa	They don't seem to be any more than friends.  He may see her as a really good friend, and go out of his way to be friends with her and invite her to more things.  I can see why you're upset, and I would be too!  But you have to trust your boyfriend and your friend.  Trust your gut, and know when the relationship isn't worth the headaches.  For now, be totally casual and "never let 'em see you sweat."|`|bcM7Lxpeaa	Well there is no for sure way of knowing unless you catch them but i will say this if he is tickling her that is called flirting and people don't usually do that unless they are interested in the person as more then a friend and if he is not that excited to see you that's not a good sign either because something else may be taking his excitement|`|mvSFD8LNaa	That's a really scary situation....<br>  Talk to both of them at the same time, their expressions and reactions will say everything.<br>  I'm sorry but I personally think that he is cheating on you.<br>  I don't know the whole story, but from that, something fishy is going on. <br>  I don't want to tell you to break up with your boyfriend, you probably love him a lot, but you should think about everything and if it worth being led on. <br>  If you think that you trust him and love him enough, then you should just accept their friendship.<br>  I just hope the best for you! :)|`|sD5KyGLGaa	It sounds to me that you're stuck between a rock and a hard place. You have no proof whatsoever that your boyfriend is two-timing, yet it is a (very) strong possibility.<br>  <br>  Here's what I recommend: Talk to your female friend. Tell her that you need to know the truth. You don't want to wind up hurt. Ask her if there is anything going on between the two, and trust that she is telling you the truth. Ask if she feels that your boyfriend has feelings for her. I personally know that guys can seem like they're head over heels in love with girls, and only want to be friends with them.<br>  <br>  Evaluate her answers, and then confront your boyfriend. Ask him for the truth and try to figure out what's going on. It may be nothing, or a little something, or a big something. But it's better you find out than not knowing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck.

That is because, although we now have a non-white President Obama, there is still a lot of racism and prejudice in this country, and that is probably going to take more than your lifetime to finally disappear.<br>  <br>  Your mother believes that means that you are not just going to have to be as good as any of your white friends, you are going to have to be better.<br>  <br>  That's why your Mom is stricter with you than their Moms are with them. It isn't fair but life is not fair, and your Mom knows that.<br>  <br>  That is why your Mom is smart and why you should be eternally  grateful that you have a Mom as intelligent and considerate as she is.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I think black parents are stricter and more prone to use corporal punishment generally.  I have given this a lot of thought and I have come up with this theory.  During slavery times if a child misbehaved or slacked off it could have catastrophic consequences.  The child could be sold off or brutally tortured or even killed.  I think the slave parents were terrified of this so they made sure their kids behaved, using whatever means they had to.  And I think because of that it became ingrained in the culture to be strict.|`|DLTT0Svjaa	sometimes black moms are better than white moms at raising kids.<br>  example: my step bro and sis are mixed with a white mom and they do anything they want. now he is an uncle...<br>                now my cousin, who is a black woman with biracial kids. they are in a nice school,nice things and well behaved kids. good grades the whole nine yards.<br>  <br>  or it might just be the dads?|`|AA11601031	She's being a good mom - making sure you grow up right.  One day, you'll appreciate her a lot more.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well, I'm not trying to be rude, but how many white moms do you know? Maybe 50? You cannot speak for an entire race unless you have met them all. It's not about the color of their skin; it's about their specific parenting style. Also, children and teenagers always tend to think that their parent(s)' treat them worse than their friends' parent(s). It's nothing personal, but I think you're just racial profiling. Even IF you were correct in your assumption, your mom isn't going to change. You should just learn to live with it.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	im sure they have their issues too but i think this comes from how she was treated as a child on how she should define herself and act, and just as a personal opinion i think black women can sound more intimidating if they want then most white women, maybe its a child raising thing or just media stereotypes.|`|9Zdt7E56aa	Some moms are stricter than others. Has nothing to do with race, although culture could be a reason sometimes.|`|RYiSYJvTaa	Somtimes they have more of that kind of attitute if you've ever noticed.|`|Sofk2yO8aa	You're generalizing, probably|`|16HN5H3Maa	I noticed that too, and the African American moms are always yelling loudly at their children in public.|`|t043WEDIaa	asian moms scare me sometimes|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Ask your friends mothers.
wch6Ojd7aa	Hmm, I don′t know about your classmates signing it, did they have any contact beforehand? Because if it′s just stranger′s signatures, I don′t know the point to it.<br>  <br>  This is delicate, but maybe write her a special letter and include true stories of people who have gone through this and how they have continued living happy with new activities. <br>  <br>  If you can, send her a care package maybe including material for some new hobbie that she would like to take on (to keep her mind busy if she′s deppressed about it).<br>  <br>  Why won′t you be able to keep in touch for a long time? I figure this is when your friend will need you the most.
xarKlp0Oaa	Why don't you write letters back and forth or talk over the computer or text message. Keep in touch with him and see what happens because someday he may not live so far away.|`|fjtxUYtjaa	nooo the girl above me. don't write messages to him! he has a girlfriend.. don't ruin their relationship. i know, it's hard. but really. just stop talking to him and know that you can move on. flirt with other guys, look for someone else. you can do it! just don't talk to him anymore, that's what helped me|`|hF6uZqWRaa	I think you should. Whenever i brake up with my bf i go out. Go out with friends to club, bar, movies, shopping. or maybe even meet new people.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	you should make sandwiches for other guys|`|bMmV6R2Jaa	No, hang onto the lovely summer memories, but accept thats all it was. .later youll remember the good times and tell someone and enjoy the revacation to that place in time.|`|F8wzcKntaa	Hell naw, if you like him go for it some long distances relationships do work but you have to trust him.|`|2RlgLspsaa	yess long distance relationships don't work and can't be trusted.. trust me from experience. you will never get to see him which means youll never get any action so its just no fun no matter how hot he is|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Accept the fact that you two are no longer together and act in that way. You don't want him/her or his/her friends to say that you're not over that person and you want him/her back. <br>  Don't avoid him/her. It won't help you to get over the breaking up and it could make things worse. You can't avoid a person for years. Just be friendly but ONLY if the other person is open to this idea. <br>  Don't talk about the break-up to everyone and tell everyone how bad he/she was. Just let it go. <br>  Don't blame yourself for anything. Just say it didn't work out, it wasn't meant to be... <br>  Be confident in front of him/her and don't try to make him/her jealous and don't try to pick his/her attention by doing anything stupid. <br>  Time is the healer of all wounds...It's true, though you have to see that person everyday, it doesn't mean you won't get over him/her. You can do it, just love yourself more and be sure that if it didn't work so he/she is not the right person for you... <br>  if at school don't be mean to your ex. because remember he/she has friends and they will get you back.. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsIf you see him with someone, don't act in a jealous way even if you are! <br>  Don't try to make him/her jealous by having a relationship with the first person that likes you. <br>  Don't be in a rush to be in another relationship just wait for the right one, he/she will come when it's the best time. <br>  Don't keep thinking that he/she will regret it and try to see if he/she does. <br>  Have friends that support you and ask them to not talk about him/her as your ex but as your friend!! <br>  Consider him/her as your FRIEND!! Not your ex!!|`|xoXkHOVsaa	You should move on.  A long distance relationship is really tough.  I don't think it would last very long.

t81MEJ82aa	Of course he is manipulating you. You shouldn't allow your child to manipulate you and hold you hostage in this way. I know it would probably break your heart but I don't think he'd feel this way forever. Since your husband also agrees with the divorce, then perhaps you can ask him to talk to your son so that he understands that this amicable and mutual. <br>  <br>  You still need to live your own life. People's parents divorce, just a nasty fact of life.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	This is pure manipulation.  Where is your husband in all this?  Is he really going to allow your son to disrespect you this way?  Is he not man enough to own up to his son that he is part of the reason the marriage is ending?|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Tell him that he has no right to tell you that and you are sorry he feels that way, but you are not going to live your life miserable to suit his selfish needs.|`|f6YsGOynaa	It depends on your reason for divorcing.  If you're divorcing because you just don't get along with his father, then in his eyes, you're being completely selfish.  Are you asking for custody?  If not, again, he sees abandonment.  Is your soon-to-be-ex abusive?  If not, again...abandonment.  If so, perhaps your son doesn't realize, or feels intense loyalty to his father.  <br>  <br>  You are making a decision that affects the whole family, but you're not giving him any input into the decision making process.  At 17, he's nearly an adult, so this has to be an insult to his needs, in his eyes.<br>  <br>  For whatever reason, he would benefit from some counseling to help him sort through his feelings.|`|AA12187979	Good god, imagine this your son would rather see some the family stick together than you with siome new stud service.<br>  <br>  At least he's directing his anger at the right people.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	your right .. he will grow up soon .. just let him be ok..|`|cDRXtuJCaa	He is trying to manipulate you as he s hurt,he afraid of the change this will make in all your lives,most kids are. <br>  You can not allow him to dictate to you as it teach him this behavior is acceptable <br>   I do think you should sit down try to calmly to talk to him or get his father too,it maybe even be better in letter form <br>  lots and lots of reassurance to all your kids that there loved by both of you will help|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	Sounds to me like he knows the divorce is getting close to actually happening and is resorting to emotional blackmail to try and stop it.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure he is angry, but don't know enough to determine whether he believes you are abandoning the family.  That you will have to discuss with him (only he knows if that is what he thinks).|`|8PDzaAJcaa	It sounds like he is just really angry about the situation, and pretty immature as well.  He will come around in time, meanwhile you can't let him manipulate you. Take control of the situation, you're the parent.|`|AVDn7Imqaa	Most teems do try to manipulate their parents, if both you and your soon to ex are in agreement with this divorce then you need to sit down with him together and explain the situation to him, only what he needs to know.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	He is hurting and will get over it in time, for time heals all. Let him be nothing you can do .he will see that it is for the best.|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	NO! they love their father and the family that you have made for them is that wrong?! Divorce is ugly and the world has shown that to your kids....the picking sides the betrayal of who loves who more....where they will stay when they have never had to choose.Don't get a divorce because obviously it will not only be dividing you and your husband it will be dividing the whole family. Is that what you want...love each other for who yous are rekindle something...for better or for worse and right now that its at its worse in your marriage you have to stand up to the challenge...you made those vows!!!! even though you only meant it for the better...i don't care what you had to put up with...that man also had to endure it too...so whatever it is both of you DON'T BE SELFISH!!! love is not a fight but worth fighting for!!!

Maybe you can tell her you don't like this and make an arrangement with her as well, like call on a certain day or something.

She's not worth it.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	You are absolutely under no obligation to speak to her and if I were you I would stop taking her calls no matter how many times she calls you. It would be one thing if your daughter & her were close but it doesn't sound like that's the case so she obviously has ulterior motives. Next time she calls, tell her that you have no desire to speak to her and would like her to stop calling you daily and will no longer be taking her calls. Let her know that if she wants to know how her granddaughter is she needs to call her son, not you and let that be the end of it. If she keeps calling, keep ignoring her until she goes away.<br>  <br>  If you & your husband are on your way to divorcing it doesn't sound like the relationship with your in-laws should continue.

1TrWuMOraa	Well first of all, I give you props for admitting this, and more importantly wanting to fix this. But the honest truth is, there will always be some sort of jealousy on both parts in a relationship, it just goes to show that you both truly care about eachother, but that being said acting on your jealousy or insecurities is a totally different thing, and can ruin a relationship. The feeling may never go away, but you can always change how it's going to effect your relationship and think differently about it. I say talk to her definitley, tell her how much you care about it, and maybe all you need is just some reassurance from her that you don't have to feel insecure or jealous of other guys. You might push her away if you try to control the situation by telling her you don't want her to hang out with her best friend alone, but texting other guys, say you don't really feel comfortable with it and see what she says. Also do you trust her? if you can't trust her then maybe she needs to know that too, so you can work on your problems together. Good luck|`|XsRPKzn3aa	you should really have some more trust in your girlfriend. if you trust her, than you don't have to worry about these things. also, with trust, your relationship will be a whole lot better. just take a chill pill! ^_^|`|YQpGSr2Laa	the only real solution is to  be confident with yourself and your relationship, you have to feel like she's not going to leave you for one of those guys or come to the personal understanding that there is not a thing that you can do if she ever does decide to leave you for someone else and even if you could , do you really want to be THAT person?  being jealous and  sad  cannot make you a very fun person|`|FVhXSQeNaa	You need to repeat this mantra. If your girlfriend is going to cheat on you, jealousy or control won't stop her from doing it. It might prolong it... or it may even push her to do it because nobody likes feeling smothered. There is a time and place for jealousy, but you shouldn't feel it any time she talks to or hangs out with a guy. Trust that she'll be loyal, and if she's not... she isn't worth it anyway.|`|wixnAm6saa	why on earth, would she text other guys? i understand that you get jealous, but seriously talk to her about it, has she explained to you that you shouldnt be alot? you need to tell her, because if you dont it will jus t damage her.|`|TCzffQ48aa	dude, that is SAME exact thing with my girlfriend.<br>  it f**king sucks broo.<br>  and try dating a myspace whore..even worse|`|gH2Il5QNaa	just trust her..<br>  <br>  if you love her..then you shouldn't be worried..<br>  & no girl likes a jealous man..
WJJ18mE8aa	Is she flirting with you too? Think about how she acts around you. Does she make eye contact? Look at you often or alot, when your not even giving her any attention or talking to her? Does she punch/hit you lightly on the back or touch you in a playful way? These are some signs. Also does she fix her hair when your in her presence, or making sure she looks good? Does she try to get you to talk to her, or try to find a reason to be near you, or tries to get your attention? I am a pro at being able to tell if they like you (boys AND girls) how to flirt, being able to tell if they are flirting. Also a pro at crushes, asking them out, and MORE. yes so contact me if you need any more help! Bye|`|tOoJL7sYaa	Be very careful.

Maybe go to a movie with a bunch of friends and then hang out after wards.<br>  Good luck!|`|tTabBH4caa	well if she flirts with you and goes out of her way to talkk to you, she probably likkes you but isn't positive if she really wants to have a "thing" yet. so she is probably just keeping it on a franddship level.<br>  hope this helps(:<br>  -morgan|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Ask her out on a date (not school related) and see how she reacts/feels about it... or just ask. :] Good luck!|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Do YOU like her?|`|DsIbGLYUaa	From what i hear you have a good solid relationship i can see how you are not aware of her feelings because it seems to me that she likes you definatly enough to be a friend, she does not show any romantic intrest yet, she does not show any interest in anyone else nor does she mension guys, i think for now friends are all you guys are, if she starts flirting then you know somethings up, otherwise, play it cool|`|lUWY9r7saa	this is a tough one..... not enough evidence that she lyks u....but do you make her laugh......it sounds lyk she lyks you but not enough to really go out yet jus stay friends and flirt alot more often....and keep makin her laugh.....and little by little she will start to lyk u more.....but u have to flirt with her|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Why not ask her to go somewhere casual, like for coffee or ice cream. It's a way to get more of an idea as to how she feels. If she's receptive, afterwards you can ask her on a date. You'll never know unless you put yourself out there. Good luck.|`|AZB4BV64aa	funny? sweet? nicest kids? well taht can either be a small flirt or a friend who forgot her limit.|`|1XtASkE1aa	it's hard to tell.<br>  if u like her then just go for it.<br>  if she says shes not interested then just try and go back to ur normal friendly relationship. hope this helps!|`|tk4PLUvnaa	it sounds like love to me.|`|6uzhVE0aaa	wheel 'er in|`|N7Yt7kmWaa	i found a couple quizzes that u could do (obviously not 100% accurate lol):<br>    <a href="http://teenadvice.about.com/library/teenquiz/4/bllovehimquiz01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://teenadvice.about.com/library/teen...</a><br>    <a href="http://www.quizilla.com/quizzes/982915/friends-or-more-does-heshe-like-me" rel="nofollow">http://www.quizilla.com/quizzes/982915/f...</a><br>  <br>  But in my opinion it's hard to tell. When u text each other, does she text you first lots of the time?  When shes telling this stuff to her friends, how is she acting? What kind of body language does she have? <br>  <br>  In my opinion i wouldn't just go straight to asking her out. I'd say to start with simple flirting ect to be a little more sure.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|remFpLGuaa	i'm thinking right now she considers you a friend only. i was in a similar situation. i liked this girl and we talked all the time. but she told me that she only thought of me as a friend. but i was flirtier and i asked her on a date. and we ended up going out.<br>  <br>  you should just flirt with her and let her know casually that you're interested in her. if she's into you too, she will be flirty too. once you get that sign its time to ask her on a date.|`|hD9k6OQvaa	there probably might be mixed signals because you don't know if she asking herself that same question lol my guess is that she is just a really good friend even though it's hard to get in a girls head. even though she thinks your funny and sweet and thinks your nice, doesn't mean that she has those deep feelings, coming from a girl.|`|aW6wR0YZaa	She could possibly like you. But don't push this onto her. Stay really close friends with her, flirt a bit (but not too much, you could scare her off), and just hang out with her in class. Try to talk to her friends, and ask the most trustworthy one that will keep your question confidential. Ask if she likes you like you do, if you do, that is.|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	I think it's best not to think like that. It's okay, just if you think about it, it can ruin your friendship with her somehow. Talk to her and find out. She can just be friendly, because most girls don't like to be rude you know. She might be thinking the same way too. The answers are her words.|`|63dnvxY9aa	i think that since she tells her friends about you, she is probably into you!! since you have been friends for a while now, i think you should go for it! if you are scared it will ruin your friendship, it will not. i have been best friends with guys who have asked me out many times, even though i said no. soo good luck!!! (:|`|BY5IkLddaa	i mean to cut it short...it sounds like that she just considers you her friend. i am a 16 year old girl and i have a few friends like that who are boys who i text and say hi to all the time. it doesnt necessarily mean i like them. if you are really wondering if she likes you or not i would just ask her. she wont take it as an ackward question...at least i wouldnt. and if you are really good friends,,she would understand. yeah well i hope i hepled...|`|xoMk5LGKaa	Well, get one of your friends to ask this girl if she likes you. If not just continue to be friends with her and just ask her to hang out like to the movies "as friends" She'll maybe get to know you even more and like you.|`|2GQv8dfgaa	haha i think she does i mean if she is telling her friends about you then she pry does. =) good for you. lol<br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309143338AAEPcLD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|WjGX7URaaa	Since she's telling her friends that you're funny and sweet.. I think She does ! :'D|`|R8YvSEdPaa	SHE LOVES U! TRUST ME BEEN THERE DONE THAT. as a girl, i would say because of the texting and all the messages and she talking to her firends about u its love|`|BFIo2nS3aa	i think that she considers you just a friend but then again who knows|`|MDqIyoCmaa	ummmm she probebly wouldnt b doin all dat nd sayin dat if she didnt lyke u . she obviously does. but how much.... ? ? ? dats the hard part lol <br>  ask her :) XD|`|209957a6b7f6277f9e367d644fe8cb69aa	yes|`|XZLQfeOTaa	well it sounds like she likes you ? ? !! good luck :]|`|NTC6g8hYaa	ok dude...haha jp. Im a girl and i can defidentaly help you out sweety! Ok so here's what you do:<br>  A) keep talking, texting, flirting, messaging, ect. but more! You need to show her you are interested. Dont come on strong but give her the idea!<br>  B) ask her freinds in a casual manner if she is interested in someone right now. It's a dead give away if they say things like "ummm, we cant say" or "yeah, but we promised we wouldn't say anything" or "we're not gonna tell you!", ect.<br>  C) talk to her about this. if you have strong feelings and you like her, go for it, tell her! But if she declines then you must say "okay thats fine, we can be freinds, im perfectly fine with that, no hard feelings. And no awkwardness, okay :)".<br>  Because if she does decline you dont want the relationship to spiral downhill!.<br>  <br>  Cmon its a,b,c. its as easy as 1,2,3! HAHAHA jp that was cheesy. Just follow those steps and youll be fine! Haha, good luck :)|`|cSGfoQWEaa	Probably just a friend.  If she thought you were really cute, she would have told her friends that.  Not that you are sweet and funny.  Do you ever hang out outside of school?  If you are that interested, invite her to do something and gauge her response.|`|RUE9VaDGaa	i think you should ask her out and if she gets mad tell her as a friend we will go out , go to movies. ask her what movies does she like or do you want to hang out this weekend or any other day.|`|a72QZhz6aa	she so likes you.<br>  i think you should invite her over for a party, or the movies or something,<br>  get to know her a little tiny bit better, <br>  then,<br>  ask her out!<br>  hope this helps!(:|`|IItEA7WHaa	she thinks your friends|`|Pz2y65soaa	Haha aww! ^^<br> <br> I'd say she likes you, try spreadin the love a little :P|`|30xRk9EUaa	no|`|PG4zLEuXaa	Hi there in my opinion she definitely likes you.  A girl does not go around telling her friends you are funny and sweet for nothing.  Seeing that you are occasionally on facebook, there are wonderful applications you can use sending her gifts.  Start off sending her a flower wishing her a lovely day, then a week, then a weekend and in between have a look at the other applications, there are so many, personally I like the hugs and most loveable person on facebook contest ... See how she is responding to your messages and then may be invite her for a movie and pizza the following weekend.  And remember ... whether we are girls or ladies ... we just love funny and sweet guys ... but sincere and be yourself ... do not pretend!!!  Let us know how it is going!
0e4wLPhgaa	talk to your other friend and the new friend SEPARATELY and in the phone or personaly NOT ON MSN or anything similar... explain to the new girl that u never said that! and ask your friend why she is doing all of that. =)|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Don’t you know that there are people in this world that like to cause trouble for nothing there Pride.|`|wc7WCTfGaa	explain it all to them get new friends if yo new friend lying telll that to yo old friend which should be able to trust you
jRpT3a4waa	You just have to take a while to think, what you want to do. You may regret it if you never do anything and you'll always ask yourself "What if?" And you still like him as a friend too, so if that doesn't work out you can go back to being friends|`|xk5XK6CPaa	Tell him how u feel, but if he doesnt feel the same way be like lets just stay freinds let him know u dunt wanna loose him as a freind./.|`|AA11280073	You can give him a major hint and see how he reacts. Say something like, "I really like being with you. You are a great guy."|`|FRNDkLNqaa	no|`|MoK5vTjWaa	tell him how you feel|`|qjy5OirNaa	yes|`|cO8KtvVwaa	keep a sheild up, a small one. and if he does hurt you drop him. haha. <br>  just see where things take you. and if you feel powerful try flirting a litlle bit :D if that doesnt work then try to back off a little bit, its funny how you fall for your bestfriends harder than anyone else!|`|GPAidQs1aa	go for it i think guys like girls that they know well and get attached to them but when you tell him you should say that even though you have feelings for him that you guys can still be close friends you know?|`|zMIjSDAsaa	let him know how you feel but tell him that if he doesn't like you the same that you just wanna be friends and that you don't want things to be weird. Good Luck!|`|sK9OStpaaa	I think you should tell him the truth|`|23AgbNV7aa	You should tell him.|`|0ZAoksGlaa	Only you can be the judge but if you want things to move along you should say something or ask him out to something extra special that you wouldn't normally do for hanging out. Make it clear that this is something different, just to try. I think you should go for it. It sounds like you guys get on really well and there is a mutual affection.
DFSHoO4uaa	oh that's such a shame well maybe she was unsure, well see where it goes with that guy i wouldn't advice u 2 firlt cause she is with someone but u never no she might be making u jealous or just talk to her in a private space over msn or something ask her how she feels about him and that hope it goes well!|`|hLSIRDtZaa	She likes this guy because he thinks he's all that. She feels either one of two things on that scenario. She has a low self esteem and she feels in order to make herself feel good she has to date a guy who is conceited or scenario #2 she is conceited herself and only dates guys who are conceited like her. Either way is bad, don't waste your time on this broad. There's a lot more females out there don't waste your time on one woman because you're losing your time at the same time not gaining nothing.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	Ok so when i was in elementary school i used to eat paste and there was this girl in my class who didn't eat paste but I didn't care because i didn't like her any way because she was a girl and probably had cooties. But then later I started to like her but i was still eating paste and she still didn't. So I quit eating paste and then I thought she liked me but then she had a boyfriend. So I beat up her boyfriend and now I don't think she likes me anymore but i still like her but I don't eat paste anymore so i was thinking about sniffing glue instead. So anyway What was your question?|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Your idea of creepy may not be hers.  Maybe you r creepy to the other guy.|`|XBUa3Kniaa	Maybe shes trying to make you jealose?|`|liid9ZTqaa	stupid|`|ERFgFIziaa	Sounds like you never asked her out, you think she's gonna wait around for someone she probally thinks doesn't like her like that,?? although maybe you like her like that and she doesn't so ask her out already and if she says No you don't have to give up right away you may have to work for the date.|`|IUd25p1Naa	She does not know that you like her. Your 2 friends know that you like her. Either step up to her or be content to see her going out with this creepy guy.|`|KsM6cWipaa	maybe she thinks that you didnt like her, so she just went with some other guy, you should make a move.|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	if she does likes you,<br>  probably trying to make you jealous...|`|Ez2j5xydaa	Ask her.|`|13QCKHOGaa	TALK TO HER!!! GIRLS LIKE THAT!!! DONT BE SCARED..i wish he would talk to me.....dang it
e22e71f7a0eb03da85f3921a053d75f8aa	If u feel that way about her, u should not have her as a friend. It is really selfish of u to tell her secret to some one else even though u tell the other guy  everything. You betrayed her trust so in all fairness u will hav to earn  it back but whats the point when u dont even like being friends with he???????? Ask ur self that question and then see if it is worth it.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Apologize.  You were wrong here by telling ANYONE a secret.  Just because you and your boyfriend are close, you don't tell secrets. You can tell him anything about YOU, but not about other people.  She's right in not trusting you anymore.  You need to apologize.  She's not in the wrong, you are.  And it's not "petty" to have a "friend" betray your confidence.|`|33s9gJHQaa	you deserve a better friend than that, i mean, who's you're boyfriend gonna tell? She should understand that. I think you are better off just forgetting about her. if you and her share the same friends, just don't acknowledge that you're mad at her, and continue the fun time you should be having. Hope this helped.|`|wc7WCTfGaa	dump the little biach.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Ignore her if/when you run into her. She sounds really immature, and you are better off without her.<br>  <br>  I tell my hubby everything, too--when we know the secret is safe with them, what is the big deal?|`|913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	Well if you don't want to grovel you have no option but to continue being 'civil but distant' from this friend. You have said the 'friendship' does not mean that much to you .<br>  However it would seem the friendship meant a lot more to her. She trusted you with a secret, you only do that with a 'special' friend.<br>  You betrayed her trust by telling your boy friend.<br>  I know you do not consider that a betrayal but your boy friend had not promised to keep the secret so he could now tell others.<br>  It was a secret shared only with you.<br>  You have apologised but if she cannot forgive you then you can't turn back the clock.<br>  You could try one more time to patch things up ...if not then just continue to be civil !!!!

Be firm with him, tell him now that you are together or married<br>  the single life has changed, he has permission to go out, but first<br>  there are things to do at home, make a list of things at home, take out<br>  trash when he comes home, things to fix in the home, household<br>  chores dont have sex written on them, they can be done by women or<br>  men, I had to retrain my husband when we got married since thanks<br>  to his mother he didnt know even how to boil an egg, sure he had a<br>  nice bachelors degree but I also work and study and had a child so<br>  the obligation is now divided into 2 people, as I remember well I dont<br>  think you made that child by yourself did you??? Be loving, but<br>  dont back down or hell be wiping his feet on you.

Ive been married<br>  for itill be 21 yrs. this march 18, and we always do stuff together<br>  I know the child is first but try to at least get a date 1 or 2 a month<br>  He can even do some things with child when coming home, take a<br>  shower and tell him to take child to park, or read a book, rent a movie<br>  make some dinner.
I0rOL46aaa	I would tell them, but not tell them everything.  Example, if you broke up with your boy/girlfriend and there was a complicated reason as to why you broke up, I would just tell them that I broke up with my partner rather than all the details.  If they ask me how I felt, I would just say 'sad' and leave it at that.<br>    Hope I helped!<br>  Alice|`|3U7WTuXraa	I won't tell them just because I'm not the type of person that talks about my personal life and feelings to people. I keep my feelings to myself. That's who i am.|`|bTt2Bo2oaa	Just tell them as much as what makes you comfortable.  If they understand that they are not very close to you, they should probably already know that they don't have a very good chance of getting all the details.  You definitely should tell them a little, but only if you can.  If they try to pry and nose into your business, don't give in and don't tell them what you don't want them to know. I personally wouldn't tell them the details, they dont need to know, do they?
qNMfaJ4Raa	It's not always so black and white. Many men (and wives do it too) are still in love with their wives, love their kids, love the family life.

They are all Peter Pans- the little boy who never grew up.|`|YfRjYAtDaa	I would like to agree and disagree with a few people here.<br>  Humans, like all living creatures have basic instincts.<br>  Men have an instinct to have sex with everybody,because it is their body telling them to impregnate as many females as possible in order to produce many offspring.Females actually have the opposite instinct, their body tells them to be very picky and selective.So based on this,I find it hard to believe that more women cheat, however, both of these instincts can be overcome, as proof, look at all the females out there who are sluts and sleep around with everybody.They are ignoring their body.Look at all the men who choose to look away from slutty girls, and choose not to think dirty thoughts, and stay faithful to their partner.They are ignoring their body.Now, last thing, Katie is an insanely delusional person who will never be happy because they live off of retarded and non-factual beliefs about the world.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	For some people (both men and women), the grass is always greener on the other side. And they have to keep checking to see for sure.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the question should be, why would someone get married if they are not ready to stop sleeping around? I think these people are causing more damage to the sanctity of marriage than gays are.|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	Let me give you a different angle - western culture is very sex oriented and there is lots of money to be made from sex. From bill-boards to Magazines,movies, -  sex,sex. Sex sells and is "cool". Last week I must have counted about 5-10 ***'s I saw on bill boards driving to work.<br>  This is NO excuse to cheat but men  who  have high sex drive  the above added with women who dress slutty and come-on does not help the situation.<br>  <br>  If you check cheating men(or women) in western to no western society I met there is a hugh difference.|`|ZEitfScGaa	In response to KATIE. <br>  You are so off base. Actually most men do not cheat. And in reality more women cheat than men, look it up. <br>  You must have been hurt at some point, but don't let that put you off to all men.|`|0u9WdWb7aa	becuase they are not sensitive at heart like woman are.

I got tired of her back stabbing lying ways, that I just blew her off. I never told her why, that was about 3 months ago, she just texted me again the other night after I've been ignoring all the others, and she then started to apologize for her ways. Which I thought was hillarious, because with me ignoring her for 3 months, she finally realized WHY i havent been talking to her at all. But I still ignored that text, cause I'm just done with her drama, I don't want it nor do I need it.

If it happens you should keep your dignity and your integrity.  Remove yourself from the friendship asap.  Never discuss it with other people and if it is brought up for discussion you should immediately say "Consider the source" and change the subject.  If they persist in wanting you to talk about it tell them it is not open for discussion.<br>  <br>  Loss of a close friendship is very painful and like a death it requires a period of mourning.  The only best friend you will ever have that you will ever completely trust is yourself.  <br>  <br>  There is usually a reason or a season for a friendship and through out your life they will come and go.|`|ynuLj6IYaa	idk im 18 and my 17 year old "girlfriend" left with the 27 year old she was cheating on me with fro santa monica...<br>  this is what i do tho, find a rock or a metal concert coming to your town, go have some fun and get some aggresion out|`|sCDiWPq4aa	I don't.

GNeLxx6Caa	lets divide this into 3 different tasks. <br>  <br>  1) not look at other girls.<br>  2) keep the attention on you.<br>  3) keeping him from being with other girls<br>  <br>  Now that we have our goals then we can be realistic about things. Once we become realistic ad have realistic expectations can we formulate a plan.<br>  <br>  For #1 forget it. You are simply asking the impossible. Might as well try ending world hunger cause I think you will be more successful at that. Is the nature of the beast.Both males and females will look. So forget about him not looking. He will and that will be that. The question is how discrete is he. Is he going to be blantant about it ad drool then yes, that's reason to be mad because he is not respecting you. A possible strategy is to let him loose for an hour. Tell him, "look I know you are going to look. So, go around the block for an hour and we will meet at X or Y place so that you can get it out of your system". I think that's the best you can do on this one. Of-course tell him that at during that same hour you will also be getting stuff out of your system too hahah. That should give him something to think about assuming he is the jelous type.<br>  <br>  2) He will give you attention. Is not like he will forget that you are there. Its just that he will get distracted every now and then. I say, don't over play it. If a person wants to cheat they will and that is that. End of story no fuss no nothing. Even a marriage license or kids will stop them. So, why worry. If he cheats then consider that a good thing as now you discover the way he is early in the relationship. Not 13 years down the road where you have more to loose.<br>  <br>  3) For this one you should not have to do anything. If he is with you why would he go out of his way to talk to other girls. I mean unless is in an environment that promotes that. For example if you two are at a friends party. Is he suppose to stay quiet at some corner until you go get him? If he is constantly leaving your side to talk to other girls then that's a problem. <br>  <br>  The key to life is balance. The keys to a healthy relationship are communication, respect and boundaries. Remember you are not his nanny. You are not his mom and he is not your property. He may act like a dog but he is not a dog. You cannot put a leash around a person and expect them to behave or else you swap them in the nose with a news paper although sometimes I wish it was that easy. You can talk to him about your preoccupations and concerns. Hopefully he is respectful enough to respect the boundaries that exist in the relationship. You cannot also make unrealistic demands like not look don't talk don't do anything unless I tell you. Believe me it will not go well. People need to feel free. He and you have to feel that you don't do things because you choose not to do them NOT!!! because someone else is making you do it. Is a choice. I do not cheat on your partner because you love and respect him/her and out of that respect you choose to avoid situations that may cause or encourage cheating. However, you do not stop yourself from cheating out of fear of being scolded. You see what I mean? I choose to be with you because I love you and respect you not because you told me I have to be with you. Make sure to understand this distinction. There is always a choice. We also make mistakes or misunderstand things but, that's what the communication is for right?|`|MWjNp6y3aa	If he wants to get with another girl tell him how you feel. If it's ok with you tell him that. If it is not tell him that. But honestly all men look. We are built that way. Ignoring that want just makes it worse for us. It's like telling someone not to smile...they eventually do because it's funny.<br>  <br>  Let him look. Tell him he can look at girls without you getting mad as long as you don't leave you for one of them. Once he does cross your personal rules then he is done with no retries. Letting a guy look is awesome and will give you more points with him. Shows you are confident in yourself and your relationship.<br>  <br>  My gf lets me look and do more but that's not the point. She is awesome and I am damn sure I won't leave her for another woman. Let's me be me and I love it. No better mate than that. Makes me love her more than if she said I couldn't look and do w/e.<br>  <br>  ps...if he is going to break up with you over a few good looking girls then he is going to do it at some point anyways. Find out the strength of your relationship by not binding him too much. Let him run free and see if he stays close to you or not. Good way to find out if someone cares.|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	i guy will be tempted if he wants to be ....whether he is at the North Pole alone or in Miami with a zillion chicks....You can't control his mind or feelings ...Either he is faithful to you because he wants to be ....or he is not ...Period.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	if he really was committed to you and you to him there would not be this trust issue there is no way to keep him from doing wrong|`|kF9XE3lhaa	amen, i live here :/<br>  <br>  <br>  all i can say is...well...you know guys. their eyes roam, sometimes it seems almost uncontrollably... i don't think it is wrong for him (or you for that matter) to look at another attractive person... it doesn't mean you want to be with them. however, if he has strong physical attraction when it comes to pretty girls, then all i can say is i hope he loves you enough to give you the respect and devotion you truly deserve...it will be ok, don't worry. <br>  <br>  hopefully in his eyes, you will the hottest chick out there anyways ;]<br>  <br>  good luck and have a great trip!<br>  its awesome down here!! :D|`|eTBfsjCUaa	Well you should wear a sexy bikini and be sure to give him some before yall go down to the beach/pool.

1PWsr8X4aa	abused children are usually quiet, don't have a sense of humor and don't laugh or smile much, they may also have physical differences like bruises or scratches and etc...|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	they are really skemish and probably dont talk very much. ask if you can sleep over or something and if they say no really fast then ask if they can come over to your house
65m62rDraa	If he is not your real father he has no right to raise his hand on you, not that a real father should anyway...Depends where you live, the law is usually very strict when it comes to hitting a child. At sixteen you are still a minor, and that is even worse. <br>  If he does it often, you need to tell a trusted friend, a guidance counselor, or a relative. Seek help from someone you can trust.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	Yes it is against the law. He is not allowed to "whoop you". You need to let him know next time he puts a finger on you or your sis or your mom you will call the police. It is never ok to hit someone...spanking on the fanny? I don't agree with it but is is allowed, what he is doing is not allowed. I can not stress this to you enough. Tell your mom you will call the police if he hits you again.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	Some say it isn't prsonally I think it is, he's not allowed to do that thats child abuse if hes not you real dad I'd have an issue with that.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. :]|`|wrEKaaGlaa	um ew. do you want him to "whoop" you? and anyway its against the law. your still a minor under 18 and even more, hes technically you dad. sorry sis|`|sCDiWPq4aa	It is against the law..it is actually considered Child Abuse.|`|dPzoUnAaaa	Yes it is against the law to beat a child or whatever "whoop" is. if he is "whooping you" I would tell someone about it.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	What do you do to deserve this? <br>  <br>  Excuse me, but if a child acts up and refuses to behave, a slap usually sorts that out - and since when is disciplining a child for bad behaviour considered child abuse? <br>  <br>  Some of you have the most ridiculous notions, honestly. Abuse is when a child is consistently told they are stupid, fat, ugly, when they are humiliated in word or deed - not when they are given a small slap that barely stings for more than a few seconds, just to get their attention. They don't like it, but it doesn't hurt them like a leather strap would hurt them, or being hit with a baseball bat or having cigarettes put out on their arms - that is abuse. <br>  <br>  You PC police really get up my nose sometimes. Half the time I think you are spoilt brats who just don't want to have to face the consequences of your actions. If you can't face the music, don't do the act, foolish children.|`|f6YsGOynaa	It depends on what you did.  If you're getting mouthy or abusive, he's well within his rights in his own home.

4d212271178bbb992af668b3f483f852aa	firstly can i ask how old you are if thats not too personal? Because depending on your age would depend as to how to interpret your and her behaviour. However young or older this type of situation happens to everyone! Thats not any old thing to say to make you feel better its a true point. I personally think your doing the classic reading into behaviour too much and that just because she hugged you didnt mean that she liked you in that way in the first place and just felt comfortable enough around you, as a friend, in order to tell you about things and talk, not just odd chat but actually talk. The point you make about her now being interested in your friend - you probably see it as a negative thing but the what i'm led to believe is that he started talking to her in order to help you, they have therefore bonded over you as their friend and their friendship is all, you just have to talk to them together and you'll probably be the best of friends. At the moment i really don't think you should worry about the situation too much until you actually know what both of your friends truly think... i promise you that your worrying too much over what i think could be a misunderstanding. Hope thats readable and makes sense lol.|`|JAKKanVUaa	may be she thought that you were not interested in her, if you really like her then you should just tell her. that's one thing I don't understand why people make love so complicated, if to people love each other whats the problem. love is not suppose to be complicated.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Tell your friend to stop ***** Blocking.  Thats messed up.  You should pound her friend then.|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Aww <3.  You know, I think she felt a little rejected when she was the one to ask you out the second time, especially you saying she's so shy and all.  She probably thinks you just wanted to be friends and felt a bit embarrassed about the 'let down.' Have you tried explaining to her that you were fact busy and all and that you are really interested in her?  Oh, and what did she say when you invited her to do something this week?|`|Ez2j5xydaa	If she has accepted a date with you, figure out what she likes to do somehow and have a great time!

qMnuRO50aa	He sounds like a complete lowlife. Do you think if you offered him some constructive feedback he would listen, since he was your friend at an early age? Tell him to shower more often (:P) and develop his own interests rather than steal others'. Don't curse at him or try and bring him down, because that will only make matters worse. If he doesn't take your advice, then he is most likely not worth the time and effort and you should forget about trying to make him into a better person. If all else fails, just ignore him and/or tell him to shove off. <br>  <br>  He probably thinks you and the metal crowd are badass and wants to be like you, except he tries a little too hard and has the completely wrong idea. Being a metalhead myself, I realize that while we may look threatening we are actually some of the nicest people you can ever meet.|`|01dfmIjPaa	tell him he's annoying and that u hate him and to leave u along. if he doesnt, tell a teacher or something. good luck :)|`|1PWsr8X4aa	you gotta make a new friend...show your old friend that your tired of his ways and are not wanting to be with him, but maybe the reason why he still hangs out with you is because he still wants to be friends, but just let him slip slowly and soon forget about him...also, ignore him, he wants attention, so give him the OPPOSITE!! good luck<br>  <br>  ps..next time don't make your stories soo long, k?? lol :]|`|53pargZ3aa	seriously, no one is going to read all of that|`|26tmsARFaa	Find more friends then slowly slide your self away from him don't answer the phone when he calls. don't reply email or go cold turkey an plain forget him|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	holy crap i just read all of that!!!<br>  <br>  just tell him that he needs to get his nasty act together!!<br>  Buy him some tissues and some normal sized shirts and throw them at him.

(if u r not a sports person, dont watch countless games to get his interest, just find another topic!) somethimes u can base ur info on your location. <br>  ex: ur at a bar. comment on his drink. he would play along and talk to you.<br>  dont talk so fast, he wouldnt understand you and refrain from any languages that are usually part of your vocabulary. give a good first impression. dress yourself a certain way, not to businessy but not too shaby, like skirt/pants/jeans/shorts/ and a shirt. be comfortable. <br>  know what you want!!! if you want a successful man with high standards, dont settle for one who works in the food industry! <br>  Dont stalk him! no further info.<br>  dont do mistress in distress, it would look so fake and a guy will see you as a joke and embarrass yourself. <br>  summary:<br>  know what kind of guy you want<br>  fix yourself in a way he will find you worth his time.<br>  form conversations of interests you both shares.<br>  dont go head over heels for him even when you guys are dating for a couple of week, but show him affection to let him know you care. <br>  hope this helps|`|5P3nPwLYaa	chillax girl white men or black men, they are all the same ull find a guy who loves you 4 u the skin color shouldnt matter we live in the 21st century so no offense dont b racisit if the guy loves u 4 who u r then hes the 1 color, oh well the heart....n if hes cute is wat matters<br>  <br>  hope u find him regardeless of color|`|aW6wR0YZaa	It doesn't really matter what color you are, in my opinion.

Try to pretend it's someone you already know or even try to pretend it's a guy (to an extent)  Girls like guys who are true and can look them in the eye.  You can be the hottest guy in the world but if you come off fake and insincere or even rude, you are not worth our time.  A simple hello, would you like to get coffee some time is great.

K1YHSR3oaa	I don't think you're nuts for wanting to wait until a special anniversary to have a custom wedding band made.  Not only will that save you from dipping into credit now, but it will also give you more time to explore trends and look for sales or specials with jewelers.  When it comes down to it, waiting will allow you to make a more informed decision in the future.  I've never heard of moving an engagment ring to the right hand, but I guess that could work. good luck.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you are NOT nuts you are very practical and that's what's best for your family unit right now.  your bf isn't very frugal and you've got to teach him how to be.  I like the idea of moving your e-ring to your right hand and getting another band for your left hand.  doesn't have to be plain, get a wedding band with stones in it or something.  then like you said in 5 or 10 years, or sooner if your finances change, get the wrap or custom band that fits your e-ring.  move your old wedding band to your right hand or sell it or trade it or something.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I have a blue topaz / white gold engagement ring (it's my fav. stone), and I knew I wanted a plain yellow gold wedding band; I don't usually wear yellow gold, but I really wanted to get a band that's similar to what my parents wear (just for sentimental reasons). Obviously, these two rings wouldn't go together, so I had the eng. ring sized for my right hand, and the wedding band - for the left. It really wasn't much of a dilemma; really: who cares if one of the rings goes on the opposite hand? Where I'm from, there is no custom of wearing engagement rings, and wedding bands (that are always plain gold bands - no stones) go on the right hand; what matters is not the exact placement of the rings, but what's in your heart. Congrats on the wedding.|`|pub2GLZPaa	Isnt there a happy medium? Have you looked into all the options? It just seems that there is another way you could find a band- just one- even if it is custom made, that fits your e ring. Personally I dont like the idea of waiting it out, because sometimes that day never comes because other things take priority (kids, etc whatever you have in 10 years).|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I have the same problem.  I'm probably going to wear my e-ring on my right hand.  I was told by a salesperson at a jewelry store that they can cut out a chunk of a regular band so that it fits and it wouldn't be too expensive but I think a plain band looks funny next to my large square diamonds.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	personally for me buying the cheaper band as a stop gap is what is wasteful because you intend on buying the band you love later on. <br>  I would continue wearing my engagement ring on my left hand until i could afford the band that fits it.<br>  <br>  this is just my opinion, but do you want to wait five years?|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I don't think you're nuts for putting it off - I'm not even sure if I'll ever have a wedding band. It's just not as important to me. Yeah, it wouldn't be clear to people immediately that you're married, but a lot of married people don't even wear their wedding bands.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could buy a $50 ring for now and go for the rockin wedding bands with the cut-outs in a few years, when the economy is better. If you have a daughter, or a son who likes jewelry, you could pass your first wedding band down to them at some milestone in their life.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you for attempting responsibility during all this financial mess.|`|eRBn7orfaa	I think that if keeping costs down is important to you then go with your current idea. If it was me though, I would probably splurge for the bands that are right with your e-ring. You are going to wear these for the rest of your life. (Also, who is to say you will be able afford new bands in 10 years)|`|719ba09e59fa2813fea83c3e804ab321aa	Wait, get something inexpensive that fits in your budget now.  It is better to get it when you can afford it, then end up paying even more after interest and regretting it.  Your wedding is just a day, and the rings just a symbol-if you are marrying the man you love, than mission accomplished, the rest is a side-note.  Focus first on the meaning, second on your budget, third on what you desire.  And Congratulations!  May you two be happy and blessed for the rest of your lives.

Sometimes the characters are meaningful, but the way it's done can be equivalent to a 1st grader penmanship. e.g. Spice Girls MelC's "Girl Power" actually translation to "female" & "force". Meaningless together, ugly writing.<br>  <br>  If you really want to get a Chinese character tattoo, I'd advice you to buy a Chinese-English Dictionary. Not only do they tell you the meaning in context, they also contain the most legible writings. Have a Chinese friend view it for you is always a good idea.

Even if she only take it as a friend-date, you never know if it will turn out to be something more.<br>  I think most girls know when it's a romantic date, but tells the guy she only sees him as a friend to save face. It's hard to tell the guy she's not interested in person.|`|lUDlCrPiaa	???wut now???
RAJ8sDS4aa	sounds like a player to me, sorry. My guess is you like him because he looks perfect and you like the attention he gives you. Funny thing is you know he is like this to other girls too. Just imagine if you are together you will be worried all the time. Emotional connection? Seems like he doesn't want it all he wants is sex and flirt for fun. How can you connect emotionall to him now? Please find another man who will want you as a girlfriend and not a flirt toy. I understand how it feels trust me. It is hard to admit we make up excuses that we feel an emotional connection with him but in fact it is just a cover up for lust. One more thing, if you remain friends, you will be with him forever, but it may not be if you get together. Good luck in letting go.|`|ECkubTY1aa	1 be up front with him 2 he mite just talk about sex on the phone because he is screed to talk face to face about it to you but if he is talking about sex that is a prop that he wonts you ..........................but im a male i think it wood be best just ask him what he wont .......he well talk|`|GgAtR8muaa	I've been in a similar situation.<br>  And one thing that experience has taught me is...<br>  Letting go may seem hard but sometimes it's the best option. and it's better than HOLDING ON!<br>  Think about it...<br>  you keep talking to him, he will keep being sweet until he gets what he wants (i.e sex). And then you'll see him flirting with another girl, you'll come home and think about it for hours and be so stressed out.<br>  The only solution is LOSE all contact with him. Delete him off your list, ignore him, do whatever it takes. Just block all contact with him. No matter how tempting it is to message him online, DON'T DO IT!<br>  Tell yourself you deserve better and promise yourself to be so strong that anything he does or says doesn't disturb you.<br>  You'll get over him.<br>  I'm sure.|`|YXchwpBiaa	from what you wrote i know that all he want is sex. you did right not to give it  to him, because once you  do   you are going to  be hurt even  more. talk  to him  about it  and if he don't accept it then you don't need him God have someone planned for you. pray about it. (no I'm not being churchy) but when  i have a problem i pray to Jesus, he never lead me the wrong way. :)|`|ofl8BHvlaa	Complete  separation even online, either be temporarily hurt or deeply hurt for awhile.|`|qKNrmCAvaa	Well, I guess if you don't learn how to get away now, you are going to be stuck with a pervert, it sounds like.

That's literally step one.  How many steps are there??? Who knows! haha I guess just try to focus on the "here and now".  Look at everything around you.  Get involved.  Meet new people...and more importantly meet new guys.
fPOg9DuXaa	I sometimes have the same feelings. I look at the wedding albums of a friend and I think of how beautiful the dress was or how nice the flowers were and think, "Why didn't I think of that??" <br>  <br>  I think this is totally normal. You spend a few months of your life (a year and a half of mine) thinking, planning, dreaming, scheming with wedding magazines, friends and the internet trying to have the perfect wedding. Then, when it's over, it's easy to want to keep thinking along the same lines. <br>  <br>  It has been almost two years since I've been married and I have saved my wedding magazines and my new wedding ideas that I've seen/ heard for my little sister and unwed friends. I think that when you have a thought about doing something different, just write it down in a journal and save it for someone you love. Accept the fact, like I have, that my wedding wasn't full of every good idea in the world, but it was still good! :) Good luck!!!|`|719ba09e59fa2813fea83c3e804ab321aa	This is totally normal-after the moment, it hits you, this is forever, this man is forever, the day I dreamed of is over.  But the journey is just beginning.  If it is the details of the day you find yourself redoing, I know what your going through.  I still look back and wish I had done things differently-and it has been three years.  But I also have gotten over any annoyance I had with how it turned out, because I got the ultimate goal- to marry the man I love, to be his wife-Mrs. Perfect Match.   So focus on the point of the entire wedding instead of the different details.<br>  If it is the marrying in general you are second guessing-think on your first days together-as boy/girl, not man/wife.  Remember the things that attracted you to him, made you laugh, and ultimately led you to love him so completely.  If you focus on the love you have together, and not any little bothers that come up, your marriage will thrive, your relationship will grow, and you will be content with your man your entire life.  *Now I said content, not happy-there are days you will get nostalgic and days he will drive you crazy, but the love you have will see you through.  <br>  Congrats on your wedding and may God Bless You!|`|eRBn7orfaa	You should be happy that your wedding day was beautiful, and try to let go of the what-if game. Or it might help to write down your ideas and pass them on to a sibling, cousin, or friend to ensure their big day is special|`|ibeVcQyWaa	It's normal in most situations to consider the "what ifs".  Just let it go, it's over.|`|AA10975867	After 30 years I am still regretting that I chose to be "individual" and wear a light green gown instead of white or ivory. When I look at photos I think I look like a bridesmaid, not a bride. The wedding was beautiful. The reception was small and economical but it was, was it was, at parents' home,and I was so happy I couldn't care less! If I could do it over, I would probably stick to the $500 budget again. 30 people, homecooked turkey/ham/salads/desserts/sheet cake/one MOH/one best man/hubby in dress uniform. Small bouquet of yellow roses, smaller one for MOH. No favors. Amateur photographer. Church was lit with candles at 7 pm. ceremony. The $500 included my dress from sale rack and flowers and food and decorations. Dad added beer, wine,pop and vodka,rye to budget. Husband saved up for six months and paid cash for my rings, total $550, it is still one of most beautiful rings I've seen. So our total would be about $1300|`|7z1l4s4Yaa	just keep in mind that the little things don't matter - what's most important is that you are in love and you are married to a wonderful man who makes you happy!! =)
FRE2gov3aa	Hmmm let me answer this one....<br>  <br>  I think your dad does a lot for you whether you wanna see that or not.<br>  He does his best to try to make you "not bored" and "uncomfortable".It hurt his feelings this weekend that everything he did seemed displease you. His cooking,the game,not having internet,inviting his friends over (which btw didn't even come over,you jumped the gun and assumed things).<br>  <br>  You really need to learn that yeah,sometimes things don't go your way and you may not want to do things but when you love someone you learn to just deal with it and do whatever makes the other person happy.<br>  <br>  That goes for anyone you love. A relationship,a family member,and even friends.<br>  <br>  I hope you really realize this soon,before it's too late and you lose people you love and love you.<br>  <br>  And by saying "lose" I mean in any way,by people getting upset with you,relationships being broken,and in the extreme,death.<br>  <br>  Just remember,your dad does his best to please everyone and he is getting older,he won't be around forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  <3<br>  Nique,not Monique.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	As you are going there it is up to you to adapt and I would suggest that you watch UFC and learn to enjoy his friend too|`|f03fcffe5bd63918c1809b43b17de7b0aa	I think your being a little selfish. He has a right to have a life too. Its not all about you.|`|ek1193Qiaa	well it's not all too bad but i know how you feel because i have this sister that goes to a college 2 hours away and my family is really close and when she comes to visit she usually invites one of her really annoying friends over. If your brother wants to go hang out with his friends then you go hang out with your friends. Your parents shouldn't have a problem with it because your brother does the same thing.|`|oS70PnhIaa	Yeah you are right, he should value your time more, but in his defense he probably doesnt get to hang out with his friends during the weekday, or as often, so if he does it once in a while, maybe you should cut him some slack.<br>  <br>  Your situation reminds me of this film I saw "The Squid and the whale" check it out, its funny in a sarcastic kinda way. You'll like it, you might even learn something from it.|`|bIouq64Oaa	Wait... I'm confused... did your dad invite his friends over, or did your brother?? Because the rest of this answer only applies if you meant your dad.<br>  <br>  It seems like, since he only has you on the weekends, that time should be devoted strictly to you. My parents are divorced, and I spend the majority of my time with my dad, but whenever I'm with my mom (about twice a week, for maybe a couple hours each time) if she's running around doing errands or whatever, it seems sort of pointless for me to be hanging out with her.<br>  <br>  In the other hand, however, your father is entitled to his own life. I personally don't agree with it, but I could understand it. Maybe watching UFC with his friend AND his children was a big deal to him. Maybe he didn't think it would be a problem. In any case, you should talk to him about it.|`|qbPGyAbvaa	you should get to know your fathers friends. he should let you know ahead of time though, so he knows you are ok with it.
BXnlS2qzaa	I think the best thing to do is this:  I would first approach your mom and tell her that while you may not always see eye to eye and that you may disagree with her decision that you love her and respect her choices to do as she sees fit in this situation, however you do not want her decisions to impede your relationships with the rest of your family and that you don't want things to be akward beteween you and her as well as between you and the rest of your family and that you hope that she can respect your choices to continue with your relationships, as you see fit, with your aunts, uncles and cousins as well in return even if she doesn't see eye to eye with your decisions.<br>  <br>  Then I would go to the rest of your famly and tell them that you are sorry for the unrest that this current situation has been causing however, you do not share your mother's opinions nor quite understand her standpoint on the situation, but that you love her nonetheless and that you want nothing to change between you and the rest of your extended family because of your mother's choices in the matter.<br>  <br>  Hopefully both your mother and your extended family will respect your honesty and appreciate your love and attempts to stay connected with them.  I wish you all the best and I have always been of the belief that honesty and a polite approach are always the best policy.  Just remember that just because your mother may not understand or agree with your viewpoint of this situation doesn't mean that you both can't love each other and have a happy healthy relationship.  You are a full grown adult and are entiled to your own choices and decisions.  She has to repsect you and your choices even if she doesn't agree just as you should do the same for her.  Good Luck and I wish you the best!!!|`|AUaFAsqoaa	Your mother, is wrong, money or an inheritance is something that people shouldn't fight about. Money comes and goes, but a family member doesn't, so you should go to that wedding and have fun with your relatives. I f your mom want to die old and alone, with no family, then that is her problem. (Sorry if i am being a little harsh)|`|CAlmLvHWaa	You're 29, act like it.  <br>  Tell your Mom you love her and you will always be there for her but you also love your family and it is her that has a problem with them, not you.  You aren't choosing sides.  She needs to trust you and respect you as an adult.|`|MmScS61faa	DON'T WORRY ABOUT ALL THAT JUST BE FRIENDS WITH ALL OF THEM  DON'T TAKE SIDES OR YOU WILL LOOSE THEIR FRIENDSHIP THEY WILL WORK IT OUT WITH OUT YOU|`|NMtewff0aa	No offense, but your mom is overreacting. Sorry!|`|LlvxiDHCaa	You're right, this is your mom's dispute. You need to tell her to keep you out of it. She may claim you are being disloyal, but don't listen. You have a right to see your family if that is what you want to do. It would be different if they were doing something to her, but it really just sounds like she is being a greedy brat. good luck.|`|2c002b64d38f097a911139bcbd1416edaa	You have answered your own question your Mother is the instigator and the one that won't stop. You would only be falling into her mess if you have any part of it. Just tell her you do not even ant to hear about it. A word to the wise if she is acting this way towards her siblings it is hard to say what else she is doing and to whom.|`|5f8b44a83c37942a3f1ead32b40c4ac2aa	Kind of a tough spot to be in, but you are an adult and need to do what you want...Don't let your mom suck you into her world of hate....Just love them all...After all, they are family...Maybe your mom will come around and eventually "get over it" if you stand your ground and be a loving relative to your family...Good luck.|`|EqbyP7Xraa	Your mom, no offense, needs to grow up. You have NOTHING to do with their current situation, and she needs to realize that it's just complicating things and making things worse by continuing to push you into guilt trips about seeing your FAMILY. Let your mom know that although she isn't getting along with your aunts and uncles, they're family before they're enemies.|`|c64740c814eeb52abef0f0a28bef454aaa	Very nicely but firmly tell your mother that her issues with them are just that - HER issues, and that they're still family and you would still like to have a relationship with them. Promise her that you won't talk about those issues at all while you're there, and assure her that you won't let them talk badly about her either.|`|tyCkcom9aa	GO TO THAT WEDDING. she needs to run her own life not yours. she sounds like a mean person. don't let that rub off on you.
dzbblpjgaa	It is always hard to take when the people who should be closest to you make these sorts of comments. You have self belief, your grades are good and even if they were not I think you know that your parents  are wrong and you will be ok no matter what they say.<br>  <br>  I expect they have suffered disappointment somehow. This is being projected onto the rest of the family. Sad to say it can be accepted by those people feeling their parents are always right, and at times like we all have when questioning or doubting ourselves. This feeling passes whether you are a teen or older, just try and stay a bit detached from the negative comments. Painful as this seems they cannot predict your future or assume anything about your ambitions or dreams!  It is a shame they will not hear about the good things you want to achieve as they are not in the same mindset as you and can only see gloom. It sounds like they need to discuss your brother with someone but cannot! I hope you feel better about the situation soon :)|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	your brother has disappointed them and they are doing this to help them not be hurt so bad again.<br>    The best that you can do is work hard for your grades and do the things that you know are right and at your collage graduation their pride will know no bounds|`|oRzqWhsDaa	that is so wrong of them to run you down do this for yourself prove them wrong and go to college and get a great job.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Your parents sound like real gems.

That I would have to go to a trade school and do manual labor the rest of my life. My parents and i took that (though the person did have to apologize) as a test of will. I graduated high school, made the honer roll a few times and am now in college and have been on the deans list. <br>  <br>  The best way to show your parents that while you love your bro, but ur not gonna end up like him, is by doing your very best to achieve your dreams.

But here's the catch, if you want good sex, and he's NOT good in bed, then you might want to make some sort of "honorable mention" or you'll get repeat performance every time. <br>  In any event, best of luck to you.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	My wife wouldn't know the difference she was a virgin when we married i lied and told her i was to only way she wants it is missionary anyway., no tongue when we kiss and i like to french kiss at the moment of orgasm|`|HBx6q05Oaa	Lets face it, guys have a ego, and thinking they can keep their woman satisfied makes them feel like a man. Providing for a family is expected, being a good lover is a bonus!|`|MjSLQlIHaa	i love for my gf to tell me iam good in bed lol i know anyway but if she didnt tell me i'd often wonder if i was and that wouldnt be good because then i would wanna test out other women to see. its good to hear even for women too!|`|PI7v39ihaa	he knows himself if he is providing for his family only you can reassure him that he is good in bed so why wouldnt you??|`|hpTstbRraa	um hello don't u feel better when someone compliments you on something.. especially your husband or wife and no your completely right no husband thinks its important to provide for his family...stupid question|`|C2GNAmMMaa	Do you tell him he takes the garbage out really good in the same way you tell him he really did it for ya?|`|3JR9LoTcaa	it's a good thing but not the only thing.  if that's the guy's only sense of worth; that is sad.|`|yIyvNjZsaa	I have found that all men need praise in all aspects of their life in order to maintain a positive attitude.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	when my wife told me i was good in bed i slapped the sh*t outta her and said I TOLD YOU TO QUIT LYING YOU GDAM WHORE.|`|XRZAFSxMaa	We don't want to hear that we are good in bed, we just don't want to know that someone was better!!!|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	i mean its common sense.......wouldn't you feel better about yourself???|`|kNCbstUTaa	wouldnt you feel good?
mvKDbb2uaa	DJ<br>  * Do you provide just an mc or a dj and an mc?<br>  * What kind of give-aways do you provide?  Some do provide things like roses or sombreros or even light up necklaces if this is important to you.<br>  * How far in advance do I need to provide you with songs for the cake cutting, first dance, etc...Do I need to provide you with these songs or will you have the in your library?<br>  * Do you need directions?  (You should give it to them just in case anyway)<br>  * How is payment settled?  In full up-front or the rest of the balance the day of?  Is it cash only?<br>  * What songs do you NOT play?  A lot of dj's won't play heavy metal or hard core rap unless you request it because it's not usually reception music.<br>  * Should I provide you with a do not play list?<br>  * Can I give you a list of songs that I would like played?<br>  * What is the mix of songs that you play?  <br>  <br>  Photographer<br>  * What is your photographic style?  <br>  * Do you shoot in a mixture of traditional and photojournalistic style?<br>  * How many photographers will I be provided?  What is the cost if I choose to add another photographer?<br>  * How many hours are included in what I am paying for?<br>  * What time will you arrive at the house?<br>  * I have a list of must-have photos.  Will you do them?<br>  <br>  Bottom line is go with a vendor that you feel comfortable with.  Remember that on that day, you'll spend a good deal of time with the photographer so pick someone that you can talk to and are comfortable with.  With your dj, they are in charge of your entertainment so choose someone who reflects your style and the kind of reception you want.|`|df56f351483d4ed6e6ba93e6963b1b82aa	With the photographer, write down all of the family and friends that you want to take pictures with.  I did not do that and when I got my wedding pictures back, I cried for days because I did not get photos with family members who came from out of town and some of my aunts and uncles.<br>  With the DJ, make sure you write down a play-list of the songs that you want played at your reception.  As a matter of fact, start writing down a list of the little things because the day of your wedding, you will not remember anything.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I made sure to ask my DJ for a song list of everything that he had. I also asked if he didn't have a song that I would want if I let him know a few weeks before the wedding if he could get that song.  As far as the photographer goes, I asked for some ideas for poses he had in mind for our location also.   You seem to have asked all very good questions, so you should not have to worry:)|`|29d894efaf763ea1c0c37c11acf8c338aa	Some good answers.<br>  <br>  Important things missed for DJ's<br>  <br>  Ask for a copy of their liability insurance policy.<br>  <br>  Many DJ's have online planners I wouldn't book one that doesn't. Ask if they have online planning.<br>  <br>  Do they belong to any DJ association?<br>  <br>  Years of experience? / Number of wedding performed.<br>  <br>  Ask them their speaker brand make and model? Do a google search and see how much they cost. Do you want to pay a DJ $800 to DJ your wedding and they are using speakers that cost $150 each? If they have good speakers the rest of their gear is probably going to be good also?<br>  <br>  Ask where do they get there music? Music is very inexpensive for a DJ on the professional level. If they say they download it run away. Downloaded files can be poor quality, bad versions, and may not be edited. If the DJ uses a professional subscription service you know the music will be quality and clean edits.|`|lvOR401haa	Photographer:<br>  <br>  All I can say is MAKE SURE they get what you want.  Give the task to a grooms man or something.  My sister's wedding pictures were awful.  She didn't get one of me and my two sisters, which was her one main aim for the day.  She was totally gutted.<br>  <br>  DJ:<br>  <br>  Get some discs ready.  A friend's 'didn't have' anything anyone asked and I think he saw it as a paid for night out for him and his cronies.  <br>  <br>  Good luck - you sound prepared :-) x|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	Ask for references and check up on your vendors. Past clients are usually very truthful and reliable.|`|574d15037516f08e8ec9fe7137772ad7aa	With the photographer make sure he has a list of all the different shots you want done e.g bride and groom with attendants, b&g with parents, Grooms family etc.<br>  <br>  You seem pretty organised - more than I was!!<br>  <br>  x
IrquK9N6aa	No that is not asking to much, it just means you haven't found YOUR Mr. Right yet!|`|bf6K6uubaa	looks like you go for the losers..no offense,,but guys will treat you the way you make them reat you..if you give them anything they want they will take it (same goes for women)...where are you meeting these guys...online...at a bar....you wont find quality there|`|YHcyuka3aa	Your not hard to please, you have good set standards and I like them. Most guys snap their fingers and a gal comes running. It kinda scares them when they have boundaries to follow. He is saying that because he hasn't has to think about it.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	of course it's not asking for too much,,,,,n if he thinks that too much you need to RUN away from him......what you're asking for is completely normal and shouldn't even have to ask for it|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Sounds like you found a loser.  Never settle.|`|uyX6VP2Yaa	your not hard to please.<br>  ur just not easy like most women.<br>  u have requirements and i ADMIRE you for that! <br>  if he doesn't like it.. he can find someone he can please.|`|0tusTThyaa	LOL...well you didn't explain your question. You only shared what you want in a man. LOL.<br>  <br>  Us women are intricate creatures and half the time we don't know what we want either...depends on the day and the mood, for the most part.<br>  <br>  If a man isn't living up to your standards [as long as those standards are attainable] that move on. If you're single, than just wait. Have fun, date guys, when one starts to stand out...look at him a little more closely!|`|PPBIPEedaa	This is your life, and if you have standards that's a good thing except nothing less than what you expect, if guys say that you are too hard to please they are the ones that need to keep it moving.You want what you want and I don't blame you.

El problema es que a una gran parte de las mujeres (no todas, no es justo generalizar) esos hombres no les interesan: los consideran "poco hombres", y prefieren al ejemplar de protomacho insensible, frío y duro, a ser posible bien musculado, a otros más discretos pero con mejor corazón.<br>  <br>  La vida es una opción y no se puede tener todo en ella. Si quieres encontrar el amor de verdad, puede que tengas que renunciar a situar la apariencia física en lo más alto de tu escala de prioridades.<br>  <br>  Aceptarlo o no, depende de tí.

BObu4i9saa	depends on how many people you invited/how much you have done<br>  if you're only inviting a small amount of people and you've got an idea how you want to seat people then you don't need as long to get it all together - so you won't be stressing yourself getting the final details together<br>  if you're inviting a lot of people and you've still got a lot of planning then at least six weeks would be good<br>  remember some people will not get you the rsvp on time so a month will give you time to track people down that haven't responded and get an answer and finish planning<br>  just remember if you need to have your final numbers to anyone else by a certain time then you need yourself time to get everything together before you turn the numbers over<br>  good luck!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well they should get the invite 8 weeks out.  then give them 1 mo to respond, that gives you a whole month to figure your headcount for the caterer.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Usually your venue and/or caterer has a date that they need to know your total count by. Maybe it's a week or two before the date, so they can have the proper amount of food and drink and tables, etc. Get your RSVP's in a week before the vendors need it, so you will have time to call all the rude guests that don't RSVP in time.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You want your RSVP's 2 weeks before you have to have a final headcount to your caterer.<br>  So if you need final headcounts 2 weeks before the wedding, then make the deadline 1 month ahead - that will give you time to call those people who haven't responded on time.<br>  If your caterer wants headcounts 1 month ahead, then you need your RSVP's 6 weeks before the wedding.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Invitations are usually sent 6-8 weeks before the wedding. The RSVP day a month before is perfect. If they haven't rsvp'ed a week or two before the wedding (or whenever you need your final count) I'd call or email and get their rsvp that way.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	i would think 1 mo is more than enough.  2 weeks is good even.<br>  <br>  I mean if you havent herd from them by the 2 week mark call to make sure.|`|8f233cd7a98def4e68276c32767e5dadaa	I'm getting married July 11. I'm sending out the invites on April 14 and asking for them back on June 11.

aDhZIhQcaa	Guilt serves a very important purpose in your life.  Guilt guides us to make correct choices.  It gives us the ability to avoid certain situations that could destroy lives.  Knowing right from wrong is the main factor in having guilt.  Also, a person's upbringing has a lot to do with guilt and how much guilt that person is willing to take on. <br>  If you take the blame for things that you have not done.....it is because you are a peacemaker at heart.  I am too.  The problem with taking too much blame on yourself, is that you become a doormat for anyone who will not take responsibility for his own mistakes...so they blame everyone else for their lot in life.  Holding yourself accountable for your own actions is the sign of adult maturity and thoughtfulness and insight as to who you are deep inside.<br>  The key is, to separate what is truly your guilt for your misdeed and the guilt you feel for what someone else did.  Never take responsibility for someone else's sins.  Doing that will, over time, destroy you and your soul and your ability to decipher your own actions from another person's actions.<br>  If you are feeling guilty for something you didn't even do, it is because you have a very low sense of self esteem and are trying to hard to please others...it is called "Approval Addiction".   You seek the approval of others, that is how you are getting your identity.  Through others...and that is wrong.  You need to find yourself, for yourself.  <br>  There is nothing wrong with standing up and saying "enough"!, I will not own the sins of another person.  <br>  I have done what you are going through most of my life and I had to put a stop to it.  In doing that, I gained control of my life and found myself, for myself.  It was the most liberating thing I could have done.  Being a doormat will not get you into heaven.  And it is one thing to be meek, but another to allow yourself to be beaten down by taking on the sins of other people.  Do not lose yourself to that behaviour.|`|YHcyuka3aa	I have been there for years and believe me it doesn't work. I recently decided that I had enough and cut off all ties to my family, I even put them on my block list on my computer. I think we have allowed this to happen because we want their approval so badly we will actually allow our self to be lied about by them and agree so we can be a part of who they are. I don't want to be a part anymore. I think you need to start distance yourself from this habit, start loving yourself enough to take up fro what is right. Dr. Phil said we teach people how t treat us so start teaching them that the old you is gone and if they want to be around you, its on a more mature and respectful terms. Its also freeing when you decide to let this go. Good luck as I know you are going to face a battle, but you can do it. I did!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I have a daughter who has been involved in drugs, mostly pain killers, since she was 14. She's 41now, she recently checked herself into rehab, joined AA (she liked it better than N/A) amd has been clean for 4 months. I brought her up because while she was still doing drugs she would apologize to everyone no matter that it was not her fault.............    accidentally running into something, dropping something, down to the smallest thing. She apologized to doctors, nurses, retail workers,,,,,,,,,she  always said 'on I'm so sorry that accidentally happened to you, Doctor, I'm so sorry for taking up your time and on and on until I could barely stand it. In every case, the things that happened didn 't have a damn thing to do with her. Her therapist said it was the guilt of all those years of drugs that she had never forgiven herself for. The most marked change in her personality since rehab is that she doesn't do that anymore because she has forgiven herself and is building her self esteem. Her situation may be nothing like hers as far as lingering guilt and self esteem but your first sentence sounded like something she would have said. Hers was extreme because she wouldn't let anyone apologize, she would always shift the  burden back to herself. After all that, I'm just suggesting it may have something to do with your past and/or self esteem.   problems. Go see a therapist to help you work through this problem. Sorry I was so long winded.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Please, stop taking the blame for things you don't do.  What you are describing is a "passive" way of dealing with people.  Someone who is passive essentially behaves in a way that is consistent with the belief that other people are better or more deserving than you are.  What you should strive for is an "assertive" way.  Being assertive means believing and behaving as though you and everyone else are equally good and equally deserving.  If you stop letting other people take advantage of you, it will be good for you, and for them.
KmWjsc71aa	Personality is the key word. That's the way to start.<br>  <br>  By the way this guy is described as being "hot and skinny", it seems that someone is judging him from the appearance standpoint, but what about his personality? Let's not judge they way we don't want ourselves to be judged. Being pretty on the outside is not important. He could have a terrible personality, for all we know.<br>  <br>  What's important is to get to know someone by communicating.|`|ZiFD0ucfaa	Personally it depends I'm pretty skinny although I'm not enough of a narcissist to say that I'm hot. When I'm attracted to a girl the real question is is she even trying to take care of herself and is she compatible personally. The way your making it sound is that the weight "snuck up on you" or you didn't really notice it until it was a problem. i say that it wouldn't matter but if the weight is bothering you try working out or something diets are slow but they compound with working out to speed up the process which is harder for girls its all up to you if the guy your thinking of is right it wont matter much to him|`|A7nIADxgaa	depends if the guy is a player or not <br>  or a jerk|`|HsrRNnIBaa	It depends on the guy.

They can keep you safe, help you get an education (if you need one) and get you back on your feet so you can be self sufficient with out him.

I know I'm gonna live in a nice big house when I move out of here.<br>  the reason why my house isn't that clean is cuz my parents work all day and then they just want to relax after work, they work everyday so I can understand it but I can't keep up with it either with work and school.  <br>  He probably isn't going to think that your a messy girl because your home is messy, JUST KEEP YOUR ROOM CLEAN because that's your space and when he see's that its nice he won'[t judge you on the rest of your house.  that's wut I think at least, hope I could help|`|8nhwMTsiaa	True love is not based on what you have .

If you have a house that is not "fancy" but you keep it clean & nice then that should be good enough.  If he uses the fact that your house isn't as nice & fancy as his is, then he is petty & more concerned with appearences than what is really there.  Not everyone can afford to live if a big fancy house, but they do what they can & do with what they can afford.

95c7561c329d3226611764fcedc7cd1aaa	If you want to be taken seriously, get rid of your insecurities and start acting like an adult.  Doesn't matter how young you look, or how small you are.  Hold your head up and talk to people in an adult manner.  <br>  <br>  There's nothing unusual about young mothers looking younger than they are.  Lots of moms look young, and lots of grandmothers look like  their grandchildren's mother.   You've got a hang-up that you need to drop.    People talk down to you, or ignore you, because that's the way you carry  yourself.   Looking younger than your years didn't stop you from getting pregnant, so stop acting like a child.

Sit your father down and talk to him about what is going on and let him know how you feel I am sure that you can come to some kind of deal. I don't understand why she would get mad at you for now saying that you love her.

It matters what YOU want and what YOU feel is the right thing for yoru child. You aren't involved in a marriage, you are party to a sham. He wants to be able to say he's married, that's all.

I would say try putting on something sexy and try to fulfill his fantasy. And it goes back to the old saying " if you dont use it you loose it . After 4 years of no sex he might have gotten into a routine and sex doesnt even cross his mind. If the fantasy thing doesnt work just try giving him a ********. im pretty sure if that doesnt get something going than you can assume he is gay. Or just ask him whats up.|`|jYK9uFuzaa	Are you serious? No sex for 4.5 years. No way Jose. YOU  need to choose between your health or his what ever his problem is. Good luck.

I know you are struggling now but, you can do it. I hope you are old enough. When I left home I was 17 years old. I have to be honest with you. It was not easy but, not impossible. So, if I did it. You can do it too. Make sure you choose good friends in your way to success. There are good and bad friends in the road. We usually pick bad friends when we start out from home, because we seek desperate friends, make sure to get the kind that go to school, and work hard. Try to avoid those who drink a lot of alcohol, go to many times to bars, party a lot, and have sex a lot. Good Luck.

Also get rid of the things you don't need like Cable, and long distant calling. Try and think frugal, clip coupons combine them with the sales in your local city....
