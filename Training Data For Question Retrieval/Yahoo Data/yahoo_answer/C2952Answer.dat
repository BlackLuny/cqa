0KmJwYunaa	In the 70's, it was proposed that plastics be made with weak links in the polymer chains.   One such link was photo sensitive and hence the plastic would break done in sunlight.   Another link was water soluble so that the plastic would break down within the land fill.   Yet another was essentially starch to make the plastics a food source for microbes.<br>  <br>  Whenever energy prices and environmental awareness is high, there's some investments and a lot of businesses started to pursue various ideas only to get slammed down when the energy prices craters temporarily and these businesses go out of business.   Environmental awareness seems to go by the wayside whenever there's more immediate concerns such as putting food on the plates during recessions.<br>  <br>  Nano technology presents a new problem as environmental processes haven't evolved to deal with them yet.   The consequences of nanotube disposal is a concern now.|`|ZWVvtIK8aa	Yeah, it should be totally possible to do something with all that plastic other then dump it in the ocean.<br>  <br>  but it won't become a big deal until its to late...<br>  <br>  i mean really, even recycling feels pointless, we are just slowing down the inevitable, because to many people don't care :(|`|RfLr48woaa	The human race is the only one that has the power, the ability, the money and the technology.

That way they will not clog up our land fills.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Plastics can be useful, but we managed to live without them for many centuries. They are toxic and can't become a natural product. When they break down they are just pollution. They will contaminate the water or soil that they are allowed to breakdown into. We have already damaged enough areas of the earth we need to find a better way. They are overused and are hard to recycle. I live my life with very little plastic, about the only thing I can't avoid is when they are used in packaging for some items I buy. I eat a lot of fresh food, so there is little plastics involved in that and I store foods in reusable glass containers with plastic lids. I haven't used plastic bottles, bags or cling wrap in many years.
z2NqLHeoaa	Not in the least.  The only basis of the theory of global warming was the huge chunk of ice that was melting up north by all those polar ice caps.  This chunk of ice was about the size of California!! But the satellite that was monitoring the ice and that gave this data was faulty. The ice that Al Gore said melted....is actually still there.  And rising temperatures rise at the same rate as CO2 not because of humans, but because of the oceans.  As the temperatures get warmer (which is caused by...hmmmm....oh ya..THE SUN) it causes the oceans to release more of the CO2  that it contains.  That is why the CO2 levels are going up, not nearly as much because of humans.  And the earth and mars are actually directly proportionate when they're either heating or cooling.  What could possibly control the temperature of both the Earth and Mars at the same time? All my money is on the sun.  And the sun changes in temperature once in a while because of sun spots, which are spots on the sun that have a different temperature than normal.  The more sunspots, the more different the temperature is.  And that's all I have to say about that.|`|pjDzsN5Saa	It is definitely not not real!

A large fraction of the general public doesn't want to believe global warming, so there are willing media outlets ready to tell them what they want to hear.  The recent presidential election has increased the fervency of the global warming denial crowd, and has increased this demand.<br>  <br>   - It's boring to cover the same things.  Media outlets often benefit from being controversial and including opinions from non-experts and hacks.  In an economic environment where media outlets are near bankruptcy, it's a bit of a desperation move.<br>  <br>  - Media sources often strive for "balance".  Some of them interpret that to be including an opinion from an objective scientist and contrasting that with an opinion from a contrarian.  Considering where the scientific community stands on the issue, due weight is not provided in these cases.|`|53VgQm9Caa	My answer  is: I don't know.<br>  <br>  From my perspective, I can tell you the howls of global warming denial seem to be loudest in the US. <br>  <br>  There's nowhere near as much in the UK media, or here in Australia.<br>  <br>  In all cases, there seems to be a clear demarcation between Left and Right.

LX0vjwXPaa	I like your enthusiasm, as I'm very pro-nuclear as well.  But the fact is that the technology is NOT there yet to provide a good nuclear system that would fit AND produce enough power to efficiently move a vehicle.  It SOUNDS nice.  The closest we have are RTG, radionuclide thermoelectric generators... effectively nuclear batteries.  But even these arrays are very large and heavy, and only provide wattage in the low 1k's for several hundred lbs of weight.  In addition, there are the radiation aspects to think of, as well as public opinion.  The vast majority of the public is still deathly afraid of nuclear anything (unjustly so).  Just think of the amount of problems there are getting the Yucca Mountain project going and you'll see just how difficult it would be to even start to think of the proceedings required to obtain an NRC license to produce small automotive nuclear reactors and have them operated by untrained civilians.  What a nightmare!!|`|3120a91e4ea942f8068ff86067755845aa	actually they were thinking of doing just that in the 1950's but it turned out that the cost of each car would be somewhere over $1 million, in 1950's dollars, so they dropped the idea.  <br>  Then Chrysler tried building turbo-engine powered cars, but they were fuel pigs and those were dropped too.|`|7Mqx9VGWaa	Why go nuke when gas is a buck eighty a gallon and the ground full of black gold.

Also, high energy reactors are unstable and are required to be monitored.   There is only one nuclear reactor design that's licensed for unattended operation and that is the Slowpoke/Maple reactors, a 27 KW reactor.   Although the core itself is quite small (22 cm diameter, 23 cm high), it requires a pool of water that's 2.5 m in diameter and 6 m deep.   The Slowpoke is designed to operate below boiling so the energy has to be extracted with Stirling engines rather than a turbine.   From the Hyperion website, it would appear that the Hyperion also requires a deep pool of a similar size, 1.5 m in diameter.   It's pretty difficult to scale down water.<br>  <br>  Also, a nuclear car would be an electric car.   If you consider Electric cars unproven then by that definition, the nuclear cars would also be unproven.|`|1CgK5Le6aa	Well, I'm open to the idea, provided we have even a vague solution for the spent fuel, and the cars are proven not to explode in a head on with both cars moving at 100 MPH. I live in New Jersey, I'm almost hit every day by impatient fools, willing to risk lives to gain a few seconds at an intersection. And there are plenty of wackos in the world. You've seen cops, people driving the wrong way down interstates, etc. What you likely haven't seen are terrorists desperate to get their hands on these materials. I don't spend my day worrying about terrorists, but this seems a little over-confident.<br>  <br>  If your problem with electrics is that they're unproven, why would you suggest this?<br>  <br>  Electrics seem pretty logical to me. With a national power grid, having our cars plugged in to wind, geo-thermal, hydro, nuclear, "clean" coal, and most importantly, solar, would largely decrease our dependence on oil and be a major step in the right direction. It's got plenty of problems, but nuclear powered cars seem pretty pie in the sky. Good luck finding investors, they barely want to pay for energy research period, let alone  for something as un-marketable as the Chevy Chernobyl (kidding).|`|AA11500132	If electric cars are unproven (what have I been driving these last few years? <a href="http://www.batteryvehiclesociety.org.uk)" rel="nofollow">http://www.batteryvehiclesociety.org.uk)</a> how proven do you think nuclear powered cars are?<br>  <br>  A nuclear reactor produces heat and radiation, how do these translate into a motive force? You would need some form of steam turbine and either a very complicated transmission system or an electric generator. Electric is best suited to traction as maximum torque from zero.<br>  <br>  The weight of nuclear material, control rods (and crash proof shut down - Even big reactor cores have distorted enough to jam the control rods), radiation shielding, water tanks and cooling system is huge, requiring huge brakes, increased road damage, and power wasted just to overcome inertia.<br>  <br>  Where would all the nuclear material come from? and what would happen to the spent fuel? Fast breeder reactors are not going to appear commercially. <br>  <br>  How long would it take for the reactor to start up before each journey? powerstations run continously, and can take 20 minutes or more to "warm up".|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Assuming you could overcome all the technical and cost problems (which you can't), the public would never accept it. It's hard enough to build a new nuclear power plant, let alone have one in every driveway. The fact is, the general public hates nuclear. I'm not saying it's rational or not, but it's the way it is. You can't sell them something they hate. <br>  <br>  Also, nuclear power plants are just like any other power plant that burns stuff - they boil steam to turn a turbine. Steam powered cars have been made before, and they didn't catch on because they were massive and produced very little torque. You could overcome the torque problem by generating electricity with the steam, but then you just have an electric car (and apparently you're against those).<br>  <br>  Nope, the solution to are car woes will be building our cities and infrastructure so cars are needed very little. In situations where cars are needed they'll be electric powered by renewable energy or, if you want, nuclear (from a power plant).|`|59f3fb5349cc37c5db705b9e5de40dd1aa	We can't trust the average American with a cell phone or a cheesburger while driving a car. Why the **** would we give them nuclear energy?|`|WewCtMpzaa	I wouldn't buy one. I don't want to be anywhere near radioactive materials. I don't care how efficient it may be. Plus consider what would happen if you had a bad accident. You could have a mini Chernobyl on the freeway. People get upset when a wreck closes a lane for an hour, imagine everyone dismay for 30,000 years.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Don't know what I am talking about? What? Before you get off on your silver bullet back to SUV thing, remember that our technology is not is there for the required sheilding that it would require to keep the radioactive material safe, so if you want to be serious, the car would kill anyone near it with enough exposure. I know where you're going, a few teaspoons of highly enriched uranium would get you two to five years on a single fueling. To be built by three autounions who do not have the best track record for building great cars, and what cars they do make really good are really foriegn cars that they all ready own as a company, and change around just enough to slap their logo on. <br>  <br>  And lets just presuppose that they can build a car that might be safe to be around, the car could still wreck tuning it not into just a fenderbender, but a potential dirty bomb because if you knew anything about fusion, you just cannot stop cooling it down like you could say with your aircraft carrier or submarine that have excess water around them, if you lose your water supply in this mini reactor, it will do the same thing Chernobyl did, and there will be a 20 foot hole in the middle of the highway which will be a part of your reactor that will be superheated and shooting radioactive particiles everywhere, well into the wind for everyone down wind to get exposes to the sickness, at very least a huge jump in cancers just so we can get our SUV back onto the road without fears of $4 gas, or a struggling auto group that did not plan for rainy day, at least two of the big autos.<br>  <br>  Bad idea... It would sink just as fast as your Titanic.|`|EmgiGg17aa	A nuclear reactor heats water into steam to turn the turbines to produce electricity.  Electricity for... electric motors(or batteries to drive same).  For going strictly nuclear would mean nuclear containment plus carrying water supply for steam production for a dynamo and an electric motor to run the car.<br>    Seeing how electric cars were out before the gas engine, it is far from being unproven.  It just has not been developed for a hundred years to the same proportions as the money invested in to the gasoline motor (which still rely on the same principles of 100 year ago)<br>    So, you want to; with the nuclear option revert back to steam power engines or electric motors.  A better battery would be easier to construct.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Two words.  Peak Uranium.<br>  <br>  You think oil is the only mineral with a Hubbert peak? <br>  <br>  Also, cleaning up the mess when a clown puts his nukemobile in front of a freight train, would be un-fun.|`|DV4xyeChaa	you are the bomb|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	gee, way to go.<br>  remember 9/11?<br>  how 'bout we let 'em buy a bunch of nuclear cars, take the radioactive stuff out, and spread it around your home town?<br>  i presume you'd be okay with that.<br>  <br>  i'd rather not, if you don't mind.<br>  <br>  even if we leave that out, keep in mind that nuclear works well, producing a constant amount of energy.<br>  it starts up slow and shuts down slow.<br>  maybe you don't mind waiting a few minutes - a couple hours for your car to warm up, but it's not what i had in mind.<br>  <br>  skipping that, a nuclear engine strong enough to drive your car would need considerable shielding.<br>  basically, we'd all be driving tanks around.<br>  which would, of course mess up all the roads,<br>  and make stopping distance 2-3 times what it is now.<br>  and if your car hit your house, it'd go right through.<br>  <br>  is electricity starting to sound better?|`|dd972fe41498b1facdc135b671c1d469aa	There are a couple of problems for road vehicle use, even assuming the obvious crash survivability and political issues can be overcome:<br>  <br>  Radiation shielding (particularly gamma): This needs large thickness's of dense materials which equals a lot of mass. Not so much of a problem in something like a ship or even (maybe) a train, but having to blanket the core with a few tonnes of shielding is going to put a crimp in the design of a car.<br>  <br>  Power response: A reactor designed for delayed criticality (and you do NOT want a prompt critical reactor for this, trust me, BAD plan) has a very limited maximum reactivity and so takes a long time to ramp up the power output. The prompt critical stuff the navy uses is not something you want civilians trying to 'improve' (And some numpty would try it)<br>  <br>  Core poisoning: As a reactor operates it produces various reaction products that tend (for a thermal reactor) to absorb more neutrons then they emit, these products do themselves decay, but following a reactor shutdown it is normally not possible to restart without waiting for these core poisons to decay (Xenon gas mainly), think a few days to a week or so. <br>  <br>  Cooling: The reactor would need to be attached to some sort of heat engine to produce useful power, and there will need to be a way to dump the waste heat (Including a way to load dump the waste heat when shutting down).<br>  <br>  Due to the poor throttle response inherent in the small maximum reactivity, you would need a battery pack anyway to give reasonable acceleration while waiting for the nuclear plant to pick up the load, and if you are going there you may as well just stick the pile out in the desert and pipe the power in to charging stations. It is safer, more reliable and will almost certainly give better performance. <br>  <br>  As a final note, the volume of a reactor does not really scale down linearly, and while you can build a core that is only a few cubic feet you still need all the shielding to be just as thick as you would for a GW thermal power plant reactor. <br>  <br>  Regards, Dan.
