20090309233055AAAKIvg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Names of Books for several descriptions?	I have an AWFUL memory, and am trying to remember the titles of several books....      1. there's a parallel universe where there's a girl who has a friend whose magic is all messed up (he uses it to cause her to stay his friend) and she's part of the royal entourage (related to the weather maker, I think?) and a boy goes from our time (or something like it) and finds her... and helps her fix the tear. Also, when she gets HER magic, if I recall, she sorts them out according to different flowers.       2. a boy goes to an alternate universe, kind of like venice, through a book (journal, I think). Gold tarnishes, silver doesn't. He has no shadow in the other world. He ends up dying in his normal world, though, just in time to save his life in the other world...      3. A skewed cinderella story. Happy ever after isn't so happy ever after, and I recall her going to a warfront...

20090225092021AAaHx75	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Does time in between having lessons count?	When someone asks you how long you've been playing for...      I started the flute when I was 9, then gave up 1.5 years later. I could only play about 5 notes.       Then I took it up again a year ago (I'm 14 now) and an doing grade 5.       I never know what to say when people ask how long I've been playing... it takes a while to explain, and it's easier to just say a figure.      For instance, if I say "2 and a half years" they say "Oh so you started when you were 11".       Or if I say "Since I was 9" they say "WOW! 5 years!"

I am working on a story set in 13th century Germany.  How would I find information about a typical German town in that era?  I need details on the houses, inside and out, as well as the structure of the town.  Illustrations, or pictures of recreations/preserved towns would also be very helpfull.  I have searched the net but am only able to find sources that I am not sure I can trust, such as scenes from disney cartoons and such.  I wil point out that I am not interested in castles or large kingdoms, just small towns (possibly 200 to 700 residents).  Also any German historians out there I am interested in email converstaions if you would be willing to answer specific questions I have.      Thanks to everyone in advance.      Greg

20070424081133AAxAZlv	Arts & Humanities;History	Quale fu la causa che determinò il movimento dittatoriale chiamato Ventennio Fascista...?	A partire dal 1922, per poco più di un ventennio, gli Italiani vivono la dittatura fascista. Per la maggioranza ciò significa cambiare modo di comportarsi, di vestirsi, di parlare, di riunirsi, di studiare.      L'ideologia fascista vuole che gli italiani imparino a diventare nazionalisti più marziali. Perciò non sono amati gli abiti borghesi, a cui vengono preferite divise e stivali. Bambini e ragazzi sono inquadrati in organizzazioni giovanili ed educati alla disciplina militare. Per i loro giochi usano speciali moschetti finti.      A quattro anni un bambino diventa figlio della lupa e indossa la sua prima camicia nera, che è il simbolo più appariscente dei fascisti. A otto diventa balilla e a quattordici avanguardista. Le ragazze, dopo essere state figlie della lupa, sono organizzate prima nelle piccole italiane e poi nelle giovani italiane. A loro si richiedono soprattutto esibizioni ginniche. Gli studenti universitari vengono organizzati nei Gruppi universitari fascisti (Guf).

20090227102956AAwbISy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is with the corny covers for romance novels?	I do not understand why the covers have to be either lurid and porny with the muscle-bound man with the waving mane of hair to his shoulders or waist, gripping the heroine tightly against him while her boobs are about to pop out her dress and he is about to bulge out of his pants. I dont appreciate for once having an image of the hero before he is described between the pages and then by the time I start reading I cannot imagine him any other way (no matter how they describe him) than the dull steroid junkie in the cover!      I don't understand why "they" (I am not sure who the cover making people are) would choose to perpetuate the stigma that romance genre has. That they are porn or erotica and are lame!.       I have read romance novels since I was 10 years old and I loooooved them. It's what made me want to be a writer in the first place. You can get lost in the pages and is simply so much fun!      But I think it would be better for fans and for the genre if it took itself a little bit more seriously and stopped with the Mr. Universe in the cover.      Why oh why do they chose those covers? And do any of you actually liked them? What do you think?

20081127174041AAXvfsW	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	      You brush your bare hand against my powdered cheek.   You embrace me firmly, though my grasp is so weak.   And the sun still shines      Your hands enfold mine; white, drowned in a black tide.    You intercept my gaze, but my eyelids close, my eyes hide.   And the sun still shines      Your rigid fingertips trace my neck’s green veined trail.   Your warm dark hands awaken my body, cold and pale.   And the sun still shines      Your abundance of love and passion, wasted on an empty shell.   I am plagued with self- hate, trapped in my own private hell.   And the sun still shines      My abundance of true love is repressed beneath insecurity.   Until the day that I emerge from the light, to see our love in all its purity.   And the sun still shines         I’ve got the sun in my eyes

I think they were commonly worn by alpine regiments and were typically dark green or grey.      I want to call them 'baseball caps', as this is the closest match I can think of but I know this isn't the right term.       Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood wear them in the film 'Where Eagles Dare'. Any ideas?       Thanks!

It would appear my yen for answering weighty questions today may never be totally satisfied. My emails informed me that a certain 'big hitter' amongst my acquaintances - Mr End Of Story - had posted a Q. One glance at the title "Devil Woman....?" had me instantly intrigued and so naturally I thumped the appropriate key to hasten me to said post.   You're way ahead of me, aren't you? That's right. DELETED!   So now I'm all up in the air. Did ANYONE get to read it? Was it a good story - a bodice ripper, steamy and borderline pornographic? What did I miss and how does the story end?

20090227103151AAKo9uY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would you choose?	I am making a Fantasy-story with Light, Darkness & Twilight within it. It's about a boy who lost his parents, his name is Zero. And in truth he is The Chosen Hero. He have a weapon (Looks like the Aerial Blades wielded by Xemnas in Kingdom Hearts 2 or the lances wielded by Shanao in Castlevania Order Of Ecclesia). With this he must protect the worlds against evil. But in one point of the story he scarifies himself for a girl named Dawn. He's falling into Darkness but because of his strong heart he'll be neither or Light or Darkness, thus Twilight. He fights villains from Light and Darkness and his biggest opponents are The God Of Darkness & The Goddess Of Light.      So that is kinda the story. But I need a name for the story. Because of the Twilight serie from Stephanie Meyers I can't use the title Twilight. Here are some examples for the title (I like also title with 1 or 2 words) :   - Into the Twilight   - Between Light & Darkness   - Between Dawn & Dusk   - From Dawn to Dusk   - The Legend of Zero   - The Legend of (name of weapon*)   - The Chronicles of Zero/(weapon)   - (Something else, like.........., I would also like a title with 1 or 2 words)      * I doesn't know a name for the weapon either so maybe you've got an idea (name can end with the word ''-blade'', but isn't necesary), here are some examples to:   - Enerblade   - Powerblade   - Ultimablade   - Fantasyblade   - Phantasyblade   - K/Cosmoblade   - (Something else, like..........)      I like old Latitin & old Greek names/words for the title and/or weapon.   Thanks ^.^

I want badly to be an author when i'm older, and i was wondering if i would be restricted to one genre of book,   like if i wrote one teen book and got it published, i wouldn't be able to publish a fantasy, because the first one i published was so different.      thanks for your help (:

20090227105015AA2Th4a	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Sir Gawain & The Green Knight (last question)?	In the following passage what about Sir gawains actions reflect his chivalrous nature?      Wild ways in the world our worthy knight rides     (2480) On Gringolet, that by grace had been granted his life.   He harbored often in houses, and often abroad,   And with many valiant adventures verily he met   That I shall not take time to tell in this story.   The hurt was whole that he had had in his neck,     (2485) And the bright green belt on his body he bore,   Oblique, like a baldric1, bound at his side,   Below his left shoulder, laced in a knot,    In betokening of the blame he had borne for his fault;    And so to court in due course he comes safe and sound. 1 a belt worn diagonally from shoulder to hip       (2490) Bliss abounded in hall when the high-born heard   That good Gawain was come; glad tidings they thought it.   The king kisses the knight, and the queen as well,   And many a comrade came to clasp him in arms,    And eagerly they asked, and awesomely he told,     (2495) Confessed all his cares and discomfitures many,   How it chanced at the Chapel, what cheer made the knight,   The love of the lady, the green lace at last.   The nick on his neck he naked displayed   That he got in his disgrace at Green Knight's hands,     (2500) alone.   With rage in heart he speaks,   And grieves with many a groan;   The blood burns in his cheeks   For shame at what must be shown.
20090227104919AAurXkP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a confusing beginning? Interesting enough to make you want to read more?	I tend to jump start my stories with too-complicated events and descriptions.. this is my attempt at starting more slowly, but hopefully not more dull. It's on its way to being a short story, so it's not a novel or anything.       Let me know what you think, like if anything is confusing, or the parts you like best.         ------------      Charlotte Paxton attended 291 Sunday sermons by the age of 6, and never understood a single one. It wasn't until sermon 292 that she became interested in the nervous old pastor's words.        "Witchcraft!" Pastor Cameron grasped the altar, arms shaking with old age, voice filled with unusual intensity. It was the first time he had ever distracted Charlotte from her usual counting of hairs on Widow Seymour’s neck in front of her.        "Here in our tiny town of Shepherd Mills,” Pastor Cameron continued, “we've been blessed with the absence of witchcraft. But the devil's hand moves ever closer. Towns nearer and nearer are exposing hidden evils. Hickory Lake found two witches among them. Last fortnight, a stranger staying at the inn in Baldridge, summoned spirits and caused the fire that killed a 6 year-old girl."        Charlotte had burnt her finger that morning. She stared at the red spot that still hadn't stopped stinging. It was such a tiny spot that caused so much hurt. She imagined the burn on her whole hand, and her whole body. She imagined being surrounded by flames and her heart began to beat wildly inside of her.        That poor girl. What if that stranger had come to Shepherd Mills? Would Charlotte have been killed in a fire, and would that girl in Baldridge be alive at church, trembling in a hard pew trying to keep her tears hidden so that nobody would see them?       "The Lord gives no mercy to witches or spell casters, and neither does the church. 'There shall not be found among you any one that useth divination, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a consulter with spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.' If you suspect a person of any of these sins, you are bound by the church to expose them, lest another child is killed in flames."       Charlotte refocused her attention on the hairs on Widow Seymour's neck, but didn't count them. She had a renewed sense of purpose. She would expose any witch or spirit-raiser who dared to show her any evidence of their sins.       Charlotte soon discovered that Mother shared her natural curiosity about the people within the limits of tiny Shepherd Mills. Once Charlotte began asking questions about the habits and secrets of their neighbors, Mother unleashed an unseen fountain of knowledge. Until then, Mother only talked to Charlotte as a daughter to be reared properly: scolding, instructing and sometimes comforting. But when they talked about the possibility of witchcraft in a neighbor, Mother spoke to Charlotte like an adult. Like a friend.       For the next 4 years, Charlotte kept a watchful eye for peculiar behavior, even in the most trusted people of Shepherd Mills. She loved to come home from the tiny schoolhouse with news of a rotting deer carcass found behind the Haggis house, with crazy old Mr. Haggis denying that he had killed the beast. News of that sort meant Charlotte and Mother could prepare supper, speculating how a witch was involved. Perhaps Mr. Haggis had killed the deer, but a witch erased his memory of the hunt and he left it to rot by accident? Or he killed it to use its blood for some evil ritual? Or someone else killed it and put it on the Haggis property to avoid being noticed?       "Or maybe," Charlotte laughed, stoking the fire, "Mrs. Haggis killed it for herself, and Mr. Haggis doesn't even know that she is a witch!"       "Oh, don't be silly," Mother said, though she smiled at the wild suggestion.        The next morning, they learned that Mr. Haggis had died.

20090227110504AAfqjR5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Advice on ordering book on-line!?	On Dec. 1st I placed an order for the book, "The Big Book of TopGear 2009" at BBC America Shop (on-line). It was going to be a Christmas gift for my husband who LOVES the show Top Gear.   When I placed my order nothing said anything about this book being back ordered yet, they kept delaying my order saying it would arrive late Dec., then early Jan. then early Feb. Finally I called them and inquired why my order was being pushed back. It was told it was because not enough other people were ordering the book, so they had to wait to order then ship my order until enough other people wanted the book. I canceled my order with them.   I placed an order for the same book at Amazon.com on January 30th, and they there was a message which said, "Usually ships within 1 to 2 weeks" they estimated my book would be delivered between Feb. 20 - 26th, I felt confident that I'd get my book until I  got an e-mail from Amazon which said to expect it in the middle of March. I'm afraid I'm getting the run around again at Amazon.      I don't care if I have to pay more for this book somewhere else, I just want to place an order and actually get that item!      I am thinking of trying to contact the publisher, BBC Books (I heard owned by Random House). I wonder if they know how hard it is to get their book.      What would you do?

My little baby sister, (Who is only two,) Just scribbled in a library book I took out yesterday; a hardback copy of Stephen King's CELL. I'm halfway through the book, and she drew two tiny squiggles at the beginning page on the chapter I'm at, and a fairly good sized eye-shaped squiggle in the middle of the page beside it. In pen! Will the library charge me a fine or force me to buy the book because of this? (She didn't draw anywhere else, the cover and other pages are fine.)

20090225101029AAET9JE	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your opinion?	I was sitting in my maths class, hating it.  My mind wandered as it often does and I thought of God, if there is a life after this, if not then why am I sitting in a maths class whittling away my existence with pointlessness.      Then it suddenly came to me, like a revelation or something...      "We shouldn't live like this.  We are manipulated from an early age to learn artificial knowledge, which will further benefit those above us but bring no joy or advantage to ourselves"      What do you think?

20090225101209AAFCiOI	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Should i just quit for a while and risk never finishing what i started?	Right now i am writing a story, but i am not sure if i'm ready to fully write it. As it is, i am not good at writing short stories (tried but failed) so i decided on a novel. My learning is pretty limited, so i plan to take classes during the summer to enhance my writing skills.   But i was working on another story for one week, and Inspiration just seemed to blossom on that one.    I don't understand. I put my heart out into the first story, but the second is working much better than the first.    I'm thinking about quiting for a while, but i don't want to leave the project behind. Usually when i take a break, the story keeps nudging at my head.   I don't know what to do, but i am disappointed in myself for not working hard enough in my first project.
