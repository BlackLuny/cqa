a86HbDIZaa	Hawaii is not related to any boundary, it's a classical intra-plate hotspot volcano.    The Hawaii island chain has been used to deduce a little bit about the movement of the plate it's sitting on though...
AA10655250	Each island is made up of at least one primary volcano, although many islands are composites of more than one. The Big Island, for instance, is constructed of 5 major volcanoes: Kilauea, Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, Hualalai and Kohala.    Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on Earth. Kilauea is presently one of the most productive volcanoes on Earth in terms of how much lava it produces each year.     In general, when you move along the island chain from East to West, the volcanoes become older and older. The two primary volcanoes that make up Oahu have not erupted for well over a million years! The age trend of the volcanoes is thought to be due to the way in which the islands are built on the moving sea floor of the North Pacific Ocean: the Pacific Ocean is mostly floored by a single tectonic plate that is moving over the Earth layer known as the Asthenosphere.     This movement takes it to the northwest compared to the layers below it at a rate of 5 to 10 cm/year. As the plate moves over a fixed spot deeper in the Earth where magma  forms, a new volcano can punch through this plate and create an island. The Hawaiian Islands are believed to be formed from one such 'hot spot'.     As the plate moves away, the volcano stops erupting and a new one is formed in its place. With time, the volcanoes keep drifting westward and getting older relative to the one active volcano that is over the hot spot.      The links below should answer your questions.  Hope this helps.

One variety is called a "deathwatch beetle" specifically for the noise it makes!    These beetles may be in furniture that you moved from one house o another. Check your furniture for small holes or piles of sawdust on the floor. The IPM link gives some control guidelines.
eEwG0EeJaa	Specific heat, is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a certain object, in this case water, and air. It takes a lot more heat to raise the temperature of water, than it does air. If the pool is heated through out the day, the water temperature will slowly rise, but it's heat will dissipate quickly, because water can't hold heat very well. Air on the other hand, holds heat a lot better than water. Water molecules move slower, than air molecules, therefore it takes more energy to heat. So how does it effect the area around the pool? The air will feel much warmer around the pool, than the water itself.  http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/...

For the constant velocity case:    d = v*t    So time would equal distance divided by velocity, or 28.57 seconds.    Then you use the more general equation for distance for the other vehicle:    d = v*t + 0.5*a*t^2    Where v is the initial velocity which is zero in this case, and t is the time which we just calculated to be 28.57. When you plug in those values and solve for a you get a = 2.45 m/s^2.

vdNUqNQ3aa	Let's call these two different functions:  f(x) = x^4 and  g(x) = x^5    The derivative of these functions are f1(x) and g1(x), respectively. These derivatives are:  f1(x) = 4x^3  g1(x) = 5x^4    The slope of a tangent line to a point on a function is equal to the value of the function's derivative at that point:  Slope of tangent line on f(x) at x = f1(x)    Two tangent lines are parallel if they have the same slope.    So we take our derivative functions, and find x where they are equal. i.e. where f1(x) = g1(x)    f1(x) = g1(x)  4x^3 = 5x^4  4 = 5x  x = 4/5    We can check this by showing that:  f1(x) = 256/125 = g1(x)    To answer your question, x = 4/5.

SvmZlLdaaa	Actually, the terms warm-blooded and cold-blooded are not strictly accurate. Under certain circumstances, a cold-blooded animal can have a higher body temperature than a warm-blooded one - for example, a snake that's been basking in the sun may be hotter than a mammal. Better terms are endothermic and ectothermic. Endothermic animals, like mammals, maintain their body temperature internally - if too hot, they sweat or pant to cool down, and if too cold they shiver to warm up. About 70% of the energy they obtain from food goes towards this. By contrast, ectothermic animals, like reptiles, cannot regulate their body temperature internally - they rely on external factors to control it. If they need to warm up, they must bask in the sun, and if they need to cool down, they move into the shade or into water. Because of this, they need far less food than an endothermic animal of similar size - only about a twentieth of the amount the endotherm requires - and 70% of the energy they get from their food goes towards growth.|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	One has warm blood, one has cold. Warm blooded animals can keep warm by just their body heat and cold blooded animals like lizards have to stay warm by the sun and keep out of the cold. Hope this helps =)|`|dGN8YoEQaa	*Warm-blooded:  Animals maintain thermal homeostasis; that is, they keep their body temperature at a roughly constant level, regardless of the ambient temperature. This involves the ability to cool down or produce more body heat. Warm-blooded animals mainly control their body temperature by regulating their metabolic rates.     * Cold-blooded: Animals that are actually ectothermic and they obtain their heat from outside sources (example: lizards that lay on warm rocks in the morning sun to heat up their bodies)

That happens EVERY 11 YEARS - it hasn't ever been a problem before, no reason that is will be a problem in 2012.|`|2JeCyjF8aa	The problem of the sun reversing its polarity isnt the problem, it reverses every 11 years, but this is just a small cycle within a larger cycler in  which the suns poles relative to its orbit around the center of the galaxy shift, causing the earth to also shift its poles. Think  of it as a bunch of floating magnets with some planets repelling eachother, and others attracting eachother, and then some acting as neutral points. Think of the universe as evolved forms of an atom in which every atom(planet, star, whatever) works in harmony with everything else, so one long term cycle involving magnetism can produce a whole domino affect in space. An 11 year cycle is all we know because our lifespan is only so many decades long, we ignore the knowledge of the people before us because we are an arrogant culture who believes we are the most advanced civilization to have ever walked this earth...we simple arent, and if something does happen in or around 2012, we can only be saved if some higher power intervenes in the mess because it sees us a fit to survive, so far all we have done to this Earth is ruined it, maybe its a time we are taught a lesson for the benefit of ALL future species that occupy this Earth.

AA6Aq94vaa	Well it's mostly quartz sands that are cemented together though it can be made of sands from other minerals as well. And sandstones are usually cemented by calcite or silica.  Sanstone is considered to be one of the harder sedimentary rocks    a type of formation sometimes found in sandstone is called cross hatching. Cross hatching indicates an area that was once predominately covered with sand dunes. Sandstone with cross hatching can be fou in Zion National Park and on some of the rocks overlooking (scenic) route 87 in Arizona near Sedona  Some of the more colorful rocks in the  Grand Canyon, Bruce and other national parks in the west are sandstone|`|6jSxYrZnaa	I doubt it.|`|KUVRekuZaa	Most sandstone has passed through the rock cycle of erosion, transportation and deposition, then consolidation into rock again many times.    Examining the grains and how they make up both the bulk rock (Sedimentary structure) and also looking at very thin sections under a microscope can tell us a lot about the environment the sandstone was laid down in and even the environment the grains originated from.    Sandstones are very important as aquifers (water bearing strata) and also as reservoir rocks for oil and gas

mbXHkf1maa	1/x+4 = 0  That's one divided by X+4    Ah, but it isn't.  Divide takes precedence over addition (remember BODMAS http://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-orde... ) so this means     (1/x) + 4 = 0    which you can solve    (1/x) + 4 = 0  (1/x)  = -4  x= 1/-4 = -1/4    PS Those who don't believe me and want to mark this down because it's an unpopular answer, try it with http://www.myalgebra.com, an online algebra solver, or any mathematics package such as Maple or Mathematica. You'll get -1/4.    PPS Re "Ughh, all three of you said different things!" - a lot of answers are forgetting (and those remembering not explaining) BODMAS; the standard order of operations for arithmetic and algebra.  D (for division) is done before A (for addition).    So if you saw 1/5+4, that means (1/5) + 4, not 1/(5+4).     Likewise, 1/x+4 means (1/x) + 4, not 1/(x+4).

These two equations are not the same and do not yield the same answer.  I assume from your question that you mean 1/(x+4)=0.  This equation has no answer.  1/(a number) cannot be =0.  And your denominator cannot = 0 because you cannot split(divide) a number(something) into 0 parts.|`|WpgEqGrvaa	If you mean 1/(x+4) then there is no answer.    Let me explain.

Sono piante autosterili si riproducono pertanto per impollinazione incrociata (cio...i fiori maschili e femminili della stessa pianta non possono incrociarsi tra loro o con piante della stessa variet, occorrono piante di diverse variet di aloe per poter ottenere dei semi fertili).

z7BiMSWmaa	Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the key to deciphering the code words in mRNA. Each type of amino acid has its own type of tRNA, which binds it and carries it to the growing end of a polypeptide chain if the next code word (codon) on mRNA calls for it. The correct tRNA with its attached amino acid is selected at each step because each specific tRNA molecule contains a three-base sequence(anticodon) that can base-pair with its complementary code word in the mRNA.|`|XtPH3WgPaa	transfer RNA - type of RNA molecule that transfers amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis.    Translation begins when an mRNA molecule in the cytoplasm attached to a ribosome.

In addition to an amino acid, each tRNA molecule has three unpaired bases.

[btw if anyone actually knows what these free charges are, pls tell me. its a bit of a coincidence. i bumped into this question when i was looking for this myself.]   anyway, it's a number divided by a cubic meter. Metals have a high charge density. For example, copper has 1.0 x 10^29 free electrons per m^3.    '"A" stands for "cross-sectional area" of a wire. of course, area is measured in m^2.    "Q" stands for "Charge". this is measured in COULOMBS (C)    "v" is "drift velocity of the electrons", measured in m/s.      i hope my answer hasnt complicated anything. im learning myself. if my answers consists of any errors, forgive me.    In case you didnt know, these values (naQv) are directly proportional to the current (I).

So    cos(-60)sin t + sin(-60)cos t = 1/2    sin(t - 60) = 1/2    Now sin is 1/2 when the angle is 30 or 150.  So    t - 60 = 30 or 150    t = 90 or 210.    Your didn't put any restriction on the angle, so to get the full solution set we should add in all integer multiples of 360.    t = 90 + n360 or 210 + n360    I'm guessing that the triangle and quadrant method you refer to has you set up a triangle in standard position with a vertex at (2, -sqrt(3)).  Then the angle for this triangle is -60, which we needed, and the hypotenuse is 2, which is your radius and it's the thing we had to divide by to get started.

Neue Planetendefinition    Das Plenum der IAU-Vollversammlung hatte die Planetendefinition bis zum Schluss intensiv debattiert und immer wieder abgewandelt. Planeten unseres Sonnensystems sind nun Himmelsk?rper, die die Sonne umkreisen und genug Masse haben, damit ihre eigene Schwerkraft sie zu ann?hernd kugelf?rmiger Gestalt zusammenpresst. Wichtig ist auch, dass sie ?ihre kosmische Nachbarschaft von anderen Objekten freiger?umt haben.

Guido|`|37b32210250154036613203c4d4ae597aa	1 ft = 12 inches  so, divide the inch value by 12 to get it in feets.|`|648d4191995c36c359d5ab8d6e98b9adaa	Rather than trying to memorize whether you should multiply or divide by some number, I suggest you think of multiplying by one. Let me explain. Any thing divided by itself is equal to one such as 5/5 = 1 or 11/11 = 1. Well, since 12 inches = 1 foot, 12 inches/1 foot = 1. Similarly 1 foot/12 inches = 1.  Therefore if you have a value such as 120 inches. You know the following:  120 inches   = 120 inches x 1  = 120 inches x 1 foot/12 inches ('cancel' the inches)  = 120 x 1 foot/12 (calculate 120 x 1 / 12)  = 10 ft  (this may look better written by hand). This idea works on all conversions. If you want to change miles per hour to feet per second. Multiply by fractions such as   5280 ft/1 mi   and 60 min/1 hr  As long as two equal values make up the denominator and numerator your fraction will be equal to one. And multiplying by one will always keep things equal!

d085f70e93806a74efc8bcac58c0b23eaa	First - an explanation of what static friction is.    The type of motion determines the different types of friction, which are sliding, rolling and fluid friction. If the object does not move, the friction is considered static. If the force is sufficient to move the object, the friction is called kinetic.    An example would be an object that is so heavy it can't be budged, like a person pushing against a building - In this case, the friction is considered static friction, which means it is not moving.|`|2a7bfedd529d64d55e216a90bb921c42aa	rub a balloon on your hair and then stick it to a wall.    static friction.|`|66701264acd6d6a77302d79ae0ae6f2baa	run a comb through your hair and hold it over small pieces of paper.........static friction...|`|ab7045db12848f209554991796fb71b0aa	a cup on top of a book, while the book is moving. a cup just sitting there.    if the book is moving while the cup is on it, its part of a system.

AA11386158	1) A high-molecular-weight compound formed by condensation polymerization. Condensation polymers are any class of polymers formed through a condensation reaction, releasing a small molecule by-product such as water or methanol, as opposed to addition polymers which involve the reaction of unsaturated monomers. Types of condensation polymers include polyamides, polyacetals and polyesters.    2) ith exception of combustion, the backbone of addition polymers are generally chemically inert. This is due to the very strong C-C and C-H bonds and lack of polarisation within many addition polymers. For this reason they are non-biodegradable and hard to recycle. This is, again, in contrast to condensation polymers which are bio-degradable and can be recycled.  Many exceptions to this rule are products of ring-opening polymerization, which tends to produce condensation-like polymers even though it is an additive process. For example, poly[ethylene oxide] is chemically identical to polyethylene glycol except that it is formed by opening ethylene oxide rings rather than eliminating water from ethylene glycol. Nylon 6 was developed to thwart the patent on nylon 6,6, and while it does have a slightly different structure, its mechanical properties are remarkably similar to its condensation counterpart.  One universal distinction between polymerization types is development of molecular weight by the different modes of propagation. Addition polymers form high molecular weight chains rapidly, with much monomer remaining. Since addition polymerization has rapidly growing chains and free monomer as its reactants, and condensation polymerization occurs in step-wise fashion between monomers, dimers, and other smaller growing chains, the effect of a polymer molecule's current size on a continuing reaction is profoundly different in these two cases. This has important effects on the distribution of molecular weights, or polydispersity, in the finished polymer.    I don't know any of the others sorry.

K6QlFoo0aa	I'm not sure what 8 feet under at the top means, so I'll skip it.    I'm not sure if you want to cover the bottom or not.  I'll do both problems - with and without the bottom.    You need twice height * length = 2*3600 = 7200 square feet or 800 square yards.    You need twice width * height = 2 * 12 * 20 = 480 square feet or 53 1/3 square yards.    So if there is no bottom you need 853 1/3 square yards which will cost $9.75 * 853 1/3 = $8316.75  * $3.25 = $8320.      Ignoring such niceties as labor, wear and tear on machinery, fuel costs, etc, the profit is $1680  --------------------------    The bottom will be 12 * 180 = 2160 square feet or 240 square yards.    That will cost $2,340.  Combining that with the walls of the dam the total cost would be $10660 and there would be a loss of $660.  --------------------------    lol I guess they aren't going to use concrete on the bottom.

3a4db19f9c569994f214958312aa105baa	Much simpler than they appear.     The formula in all cases is F=ma.    F is the force  m is the mass  a is acceleration, and gravity is about 9.8m/s^2.    1.  The weight on the bottom cord is only the bottom bucket.    F = 2 x 9.8 = 19.6    2. the total weight on the top cord is the total weight of both buckets, ie 4kg.    F = 4 x 9.8 = 39.2    3.  The upward acceleration is adding to gravity, so now "a" = 1.48 + 9.8 = 11.28.    Upper cord is still supporting both buckets so...    F = 4 x 11.28 = 45.12.    Those values for F are in Kg m / s^2, called "kilograms force".  Often, force is represented in Newtons (N).  the conversion is about 1 Kg m / s^2 = 9.8N.  Just multiply the above results by 9.8 for an approximate value in Newtons.|`|3005baa01ef9604f9c3dcd66f5ca7679aa	For both scenarios start with the "free-body" diagram.    1st case, no acceleration:  ---------------------------------    The free-body diagram of the upper bucket should show the tension of the upper cord (T1) pointing up, and the tension in the lower cord (T2) PLUS mg of the upper bucket pointing down.    The free-body diagram of the lower bucket should show T2 pointing up and mg of the lower bucket pointing down.    The 2 free-body diagrams lead to the equations,       T1 - T2 - mg = 0   and   T2 - mg = 0    giving,       T1 = 2mg   and   T2 = mg    2nd case, acceleration:  ------------------------------    Same procedure as above EXCEPT now the sum of ALL forces does NOT equal zero. This will lead to the equations,    T1 - T2 - mg = ma   and   T2 - mg = ma    giving,    T1 = 2m(a + g)   and   T2 = m(a + g)|`|AA11474133	Start with F=ma (Force = Mass * acceleration)    g=9.8 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)    1 N = 1 kg * 1 m/s^2.

Now the solution,  Basically, there are two rules that you can apply for an elastic collision :     1) Linear momentum in a particular direction is conserved in all cases. So,        m1u1+m2u2=m1v1+m2v2  or, 0.440 X 3.04 + 0 = 0.440 X v1 +  0.950v2  or, 1.3376 = 0.440v1 + 0.950 v2  ----- (Equation 1)    2) Kinetic energy is conserved, so,   u1 - u2 = v2 - v1  or, 3.04 - 0 = v2 - v1  so, v2 - v1 = 3.04 -----------(Equation 2)  v2 = 3.04 + v1    Now, solving the 2 equations,  1.3376 = 0.440v1 + 0.950(3.04+v1)  or, 1.3376 = 0.440v1 + 2.888 + 0.950v1  or, 1.3376-2.888 = 0.440v1 + 0.950v1  or, -1.5504 = 1.39v1  therefore, v1 ~ -1.12  (i.e. speed of lighter puck is 1.12m/s to the west)    Now, v2 = 3.04 + v1  i.e. v2 = 3.04 + (-1.12)  So, v2 = 1.92m/s (i.e. to the east)    That's it ;)  Let me know if I'm wrong...|`|AA10678586	let's take the convention:  - letter A to refer the ice puck initially moving  - letter B the puck initially in rest  - number 1 to refer conditions before the collision  - number 2 to refer conditions after the collision    conservation of linear momentum:  p1 (before collision) = p2 (after collision)  mA*vA1 + 0 = mA*vA2 + mB*vB2             (Eq 1)    conservation of kinetic energy (elastic collision)  mA*(vA1)2 + 0 = mA*(vA2)2 + mB*(vB2)2          (Eq. 2)    from Eq. 1 you can get:  vA2 = (mA*vA1 - mB*vB2)/(mA)    substituting in Eq 2:   mA*(vA1)2 = mA*[(mA*vA1 - mB*vB2)/(mA)]2 + mB*(vB2)2    that is a quadratic equation that can be solved for vB2 (the final velocity of the heavier puck)    mA*(vA1)2 = mA*(vA1)2 - 2*mB*vA1*vB2 + [(mB)/(mA)]2*(vB2)2 + mB*(vB2)2    0 = vB2*{-2*mB*vA1 + {[(mB)/(mA)]2 + mB}*(vB2)}    solutions:  vB2 = 0  vB2 = (2*mB*vA1)/{[(mB)/(mA)]2 + mB}  vB2 = (2*0.950 kg*3.04 m/s) / {[(0.950 kg)/(0.440 kg)]2 + 0.950 kg}  vB2 = 1.03 m/s  (positive value because is moving east)
AA11474133	I don't know why the other answers say the capacitor will charge when the switch closes.  You have no voltage source to cause that.  All RC charging/discharging is exponential.  For this case you want a decreasing function.  So that is:    V = V0 e^(-t/RC)    Set V = 0.01V0 and solve for t.|`|AA10391664	The EE is correct.

INTRODUCTION  College Physics II  Lab 6: RC Circuits  Peter Rolnick with Taner Edis  Spring 2002  Read section 20.13 in the book before coming to this lab.  Introduction  Consider the circuit shown. If left for long enough, the charge on the  capacitor will increase from q = 0 to q = CV0. During that time, q will  change with time according to the relation  q(t) = CV0 1 ???? e???? t  RC   while the capacitor is being charged. The voltage dierence between the  plates of the capacitor will be  V (t) =  q  C  = V0 1 ???? e???? t  RC   V0  R  C      XX  XX  XX  XX  Phys 186 Lab 6: RC Circuits 1  ACTIVITY 1: THE RC CIRCUIT  If we now quickly disconnect the voltage source, and allow the capacitor  to discharge across the resistor, q will decrease|quickly at rst, then more  slowly|according to the relation  q(t) = CV0e???? t  RC  while being discharged, and the voltage dierence between the plates of the  capacitor will be  V (t) =  q  C  = V0e???? t  RC (1)  R  C      XX  XX  XX  XX  This is what you will observe on the oscilloscope as we alternately charge  and discharge the capacitor. This is accomplished by using a square wave  voltage, which is equivalent to attaching and disconnecting a battery: when  in square wave mode, the function generator alternates between V = V0  and V = 0. The capacitor will charge when the square wave is at V = V0,  discharge when the square wave is at V = 0, charge, discharge, . . .  Activity 1: The RC Circuit  First, you will see a capacitor in an RC circuit charging and discharging,  and directly compare what you see with the voltage source which is being  turned on and o. For the set-up we will be using, the time to charge and  discharge is so fast that the only way you can see it is using an oscilloscope.  You will observe how the shape of the charging and discharging curves vary  as a function of the resistance in the circuit. You will also see that if you  don't give the circuit enough time between when the voltage source turns on  and o, the circuit will not have time to completely charge or to completely  discharge, resulting in a decrease in amplitude.  Phys 186 Lab 6: RC Circuits 2  ACTIVITY 1: THE RC CIRCUIT  Second, you will take measurements directly o the discharge curve on  the oscilloscope, and use those data to make a graph, the slope of which  is ????1=RC. You will also calculate ????1=RC using the nominal values of the  resistor and the capacitor, and compare that with your results from the  graph.  R  C  Ch1 Ch2  Oscilloscope  f gen        XX  XX  XX  XX  Set up the circuit shown. The oscilloscope should be set to view both  traces; be sure you know which trace is which voltage: Ch1 is the function  generator and Ch2 is the capacitor. Set the function generator to square  wave, about 1000 Hz, and any voltage greater than zero. The R shown in  the diagram is actually a series combination of the external resistance (the  decade resistance box) and the internal resistance of the function generator  R = Rexternal + Rinternal  Rinternal = 600    for the Hewlett-Packard signal generators, Rinternal = 50:0     for the Tektronix function generators. The capacitor is .0100 F, that is,  1:00  10????8 F.  Some precautions so the equipment survives:   Make sure that the power supply is set on the 2 V peak-to-peak range.  The 20 V range could result in too much power dissipation|more than  the power rating of some of the circuit elements.   Never allow any current to   ow through the variable resistor when it  is set to zero resistance. Again, this could result in too much power  dissipation|more than the power rating of some of the components of  the variable resistor.  Phys 186 Lab 6: RC Circuits 3  ACTIVITY 1: THE RC CIRCUIT   Make sure that the negative (or ground) connections from Ch1 and Ch2  both go to the same point between the signal generator and the capacitor.  Otherwise, you will have a ground loop problem. The negatives of  both Ch1 and Ch2 are connected to each other inside the oscilloscope,  so they must be connected to the same place in the circuit.  Now, do the following:  1. Draw a picture of the Ch1 trace as compared to the Ch2 trace for a  range of values for R from 3000    to 15,000   , noting the dierence  and similarities between the two traces for dierent values of R. To  hand in: qualitative drawings, noting R = Rexternal + Rinternal for  each drawing.  2. Notice, for a given set of values for R, C, and signal amplitude, what  happens to the Ch2 trace as the frequency gets very high. At very high  frequencies there should be hardly any amplitude. Ask yourself why.  By trial and error, make a rough estimate of the frequency at which the  amplitude starts to decrease noticeably. The inverse of that frequency  is the time, T, it takes for the signal to \reach its nal destination." At  higher frequencies, the period becomes smaller than T, and the signal  doesn't have enough time to \reach its nal destination." Later you  will nd the time constant  , which is the time it takes for the signal  to make it about one third of the way \to its nal destination."

I think you mean how long will it take to become  99% charged. If the capacitor is discharging scroll down    The time constant (time to become 63% charged) for an RC circuit is T=RC so in this case T=6700 x 6E-6 =0.0402sec. (don't forget to include the prefixes in your calculation)    At t=n T (n time constants), V= V[n-1]+(.63*(100- V[n-1]))  At t=0 the capacitor voltage will be 0%  At t=1T  the capacitor voltage will be 63%  At t=2T the capacitor voltage will be 86.5%  At t=3T the capacitor voltage will be 94.9%  At t=4T the capacitor voltage will be 98.1%  At t=5T the capacitor voltage will be 99.3%    So after 5 time constants the charge is 99% of total in this case T= 0.0402sec so V= 99% of max at 5*(0.0402) = 0.201sec    If the capacitor is discharging the time is the same as    The capacitor discharges by 63% of the remainder each time constant so     At t= nT (n time constants), V=0.37^n x Vo    At t=0, V= Vo  At t=1T, V=0.37Vo  At t=2T, V=0.136Vo  At t=3T, V=0.050Vo  At t=4T, V=0.018Vo  At t=5T, V=0.007Vo|`|87f27534ded8fc8bd42ac133d48b17dfaa	The voltage will discharges and decreases at an exponential rate.  0.1*Vo=Vo*exp(-t/RC).  which can be simplified to 0.1=exp(-t/RC)    Just solve for this equation.

For example, to get 0 heads, you can choose each coin and each flips both tails.  2/3 of the time it is the fair coin so when that is true it is 1/4 probability to get both heads, agree?

It does not 'push' the object in any direction at all. If it were pushing the object, you'd see table or chair or anything moving around like crazy :)     If you make one object move while it's touching another object, you'd feel as if there's another force that 'push' back. The real explanation is that it doesn't push you back, it just prevent you from moving the object.     For example, if you put a large table on the floor, it'd stand still, right? When you push it, you'll need an amount of energy to make it start moving. Try putting the very same table on ice rink (hockey rink), and you could move it with ease. That's the concept of Friction force. The surface of the floor has a bigger friction coeficient compared to the surface of ice. The mass of the table remains the same of course.    The formula is something like this (remembered it vaguely):    Friction force = friction coeficient x mass of the moving object.    The friction coeficient remains the same for a particular object as long as the surface isn't altered in any way, namely putting oil on top, or grind it to a smooth surface. Friction coeficient usually around 0 (0.1, 0.3, etc). The mass of the object also contributes to the force. Pushing a chair and a large table across the very same floor requires different amount of energy.    Heat is the byproduct of the action. As you know, force cannot be diminished. Force can however, change form. In this case, friction force change its form to heat force. This is what happened to wooden matches. The surface is very coarse and flammable. The friction force change form to heat force, and heat force fires up the match.     Back to your question, the effect of friction force on a motion of an object, is decelarate it to eventually comes to a stop. So when an object is moving, the touching surface is preventing the object to move, not 'pushing' it back.

You will need to know the element and its mass number/ no. of neutrons, then look up whether that particular isotope is radioactive.  If it is (eg U235, C14) then it's unstable.  Other isotopes such as U238 or C12 are stable.    If it's reactivity you're after then it depends on quite a lot of things.  If it's group I or VII the probably reactivity, but that also depends on environment.  Sodium soaked in paraffin oil is quite stable after forming the oxide layer.  On the other hand even 'inert gases' like Xe can be reacted with extremely reactive reagents like HF.  As an aside temperature/pressure/atmosphere may also be a factor.  Nothing will react at absolute zero or in a vacuum.

0faaf8fa3b7a14f449d2bca46f87d6b3aa	resposta  resumo sobre Por que o a?o inoxidvel n?o enferruja=O a?o inoxidvel  uma liga de ferro e cromo, tambm ligado ao nquel e molibdnio que apresenta propriedades fsico-qumicas superiores aos a?os comuns, sendo a alta resistncia a oxida??o atmosfrica a sua principal caracterstica. As principais famlias dos A?os Inoxidveis, classificados segundo a sua microestrutura, s?o: Ferrticos, Austenticos, Martensticos, Endurecveis por Precipita??o e Duplex.    Estes elementos de liga , em particular o cromo, conferem uma excelente resistncia  corros?o quando comparados com os a?os carbono. Eles s?o, na realidade, a?os oxidveis. Isto , o cromo presente na liga oxida-se em contato com o oxignio do ar, formando uma pelcula, muito fina e estvel, de xido de cromo - Cr2O3 - que se foma na superfcie exposta ao meio. Ela  chamada de camada passiva e tem a fun??o de proteger a superfcie do a?o contra processos corrosivos. Para isto,  necessrio uma quantidade mnima de cromo de cerca de 11% em massa. Esta pelcula  aderente e impermevel, isolando o metal abaixo dela do meio agressivo. Assim, deve-se tomar cuidado para n?o reduzir localmente o teor de cromo dos a?os inoxidveis durante o processamento. Este processo  conhecido em metalurgia como passiva??o. Por ser muito fina  cerca de 100 angstrons  a pelcula tem pouca intera??o com a luz e permite que o material continue apresentando seu brilho caracterstico. Histria=O a?o inoxidvel foi descoberto por Harry Brearley ( 1871-1948 ), que come?ou a trabalhar como operrio numa produtora de a?o com a idade de 12 anos, na sua terra natal Sheffield (Inglaterra).    Em 1912, Harry come?ou a investigar, a pedido dos fabricantes de armas, uma liga metlica que apresentasse uma resistncia maior ao desgaste que ocorria no interior dos canos das armas de fogo como resultado do calor liberado pelos gases.    De incio a sua pesquisa consistia em investigar uma liga que apresentasse uma maior resistncia a eros?o, porm ao realizar o ataque qumico para revelar a microestrutura desses novos a?os com altos teores de cromo que estava pesquisando, Brearley notou que o cido ntrico - um reativo comum para os a?os - n?o surtia efeito algum.    Brearley n?o obteve uma liga metlica que resistisse ao desgaste, porm obteve uma liga metlica resistente a corros?o. A aplica??o imediata foi destinado para a fabrica??o de talheres, que at ent?o eram fabricados a partir de a?o carbono e se corroam com facilidade devido aos cidos presentes nos alimentos. Aplica??es=Os a?os inoxidveis s?o utilizados principalmente para quatro tipos de mercados:        * Eletrodomsticos: Grandes eletrodomsticos e pequenos tenslios domsticos.      * Automotores: produ??o de pe?as para veculos automotores como, por exemplo, canos de descarga.      * Constru??o: edificios e mobilirios,      * Industria: alimenta??o, produtos qumicos e petrleo.    Sua resistncia a corros?o, suas propriedades higinicas e estticas fazem do a?o inoxidvel um material muito atrativo para satisfazer diversos tipos de demandas. Os produtos de limpeza indicados para a limpeza do A?o Inox s?o: o sab?o, o detergentes suaves e/ou neutros e as solu??es de am?nia (removedores caseiros) em gua morna. Aplique com um pano macio ou uma esponja de nailon fino, enxague em gua abundante e seque com pano macio.    [editar] Tipos de A?o Inoxidvel    Como mencionado anteiormente, podemos classificar o A?o Inox nos grupos: Ferrticos, Austenticos, Martensticos, Endurecveis por Precipita??o e Duplex.    Existem outras variantes destes grupos, como, por exemplo, os a?os inoxidveis duplex (que possuem 50%de ferrita e 50% de austenita) e os a?os inoxidveis endurecveis por precipita??o.    As diversas microestruturas dos a?os s?o fun??o da quantidade dos elementos de liga presentes. Existem basicamente dois grupos de elementos de liga: os que estabilizam a ferrita(Cr, Si, Mo, Ti e Nb); e os que estabilizam a austenita (Ni, C, N e Mn).    A composi??o qumica junto com o processamento termo-mecanico, confere aos a?os inoxidveis propriedades diferentes. Assim, cada grupo de a?o inox tem uma aplica??o. Abaixo, temos algumas aplica??es dos a?os inoxidveis.        * Austentico (resistente  corros?o)            o equipamentos para indstria qumica e petroqumica            o equipamentos para indstria alimentcia e farmacutica            o constru??o civil            o baixelas e utenslios domsticos.      * Ferrtico (resistente  corros?o,mais barato)            o eletrodomsticos (fog?es, geladeiras, etc)            o balc?es frigorficos            o moedas            o indstria automobilstica            o talheres      * Martenstico (dureza elevada)            o cutelaria            o instrumentos cirrgicos como bisturi e pin?as            o facas de corte            o discos de freio    [editar] Propriedades        * Alta resistncia  corros?o      * Resistncia mecanica adequada      * Facilidade de limpeza/Baixa rugosidade superficial      * Aparncia hignica      * Material inerte      * Facilidade de conforma??o      * Facilidade de uni?o      * Resistncia a altas temperaturas      * Resistncia a temperaturas criognicas (abaixo de 0C)      * Resistncia s varia??es bruscas de temperatura      * Acabamentos superficiais e formas variadas      * Forte pelo visual (modernidade, leveza e prestgio)      * Rela??o Custo/Benefcio favorvel      * Baixo custo de manuten??o      * Material reciclvel|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	N?o enferruja devido a n?o rea??o do oxignio.|`|4db69ce46bdc2368ed13f091083c29dbaa	Os chamados a?os inoxidveis na verdade enferrujam!

Ocorre a forma??o de Fe(OH)3, que passa gradualmente para Fe2O3 (ferrugem) por precipita??o.  H vrios processos para tornar um a?o menos suscetvel  corros?o. O mais comum  a adi??o de outros metais, formando uma liga protetora. O caso mais comum  o cromo que absorve o oxignio formando uma pelcula protetora. Quando introduzimos outros metais na liga de a?o, precisamos manter o teor de carbono baixo.   Devemos lembra que h outras formas de proteger o metal contra corros?o e dependendo do meio circunvizinho, uma forma pode ser mais eficiente do que outra. Por exemplo, a a??o da gua salgada e do cido clordrico s?o as formas mais agressivas de corros?o podendo destruir uma barra de a?o-carbono comum desprotegida em aproximadamente 6horas. Neste caso, o nico metal resistente  o titanio. Op??es baseadas em polmeros tm apresentado resultados satisfatrios.  O termo a?o inoxidvel  inadequado, pois o princpio bsico desses a?os  a oxida??o controlada da camada superficial do metal. Podemos considerar que h trs classes de a?os inox:  I - a?os inoxidveis martensticos - ou endurecveis  II - a?os inoxidveis ferrticos - n?o endurecveis  III - a?os inoxidveis austenticos - tambm n?o endurecveis  O grupo I e II s?o essencialmente ligas de ferro e cromo, enquanto o grupo III compreende as ligas de ferro-cromo nquel.|`|S34MKfsMaa	A?O  A MISTURA DE FERRO E CARBONO.

Based on the Energy Information Adminstration's info sheet online, the approximate value of 1 gallon of gasoline is 125,000 BTU.

QpHQyjiKaa	I've never seen this question before. However, I thought over the problem for a few mins. & my mind sprang up on the following. Maybe this might help you.     Let the gas you are inserting inside the balloon be an ideal gas. Also, assume that the rubber with which the balloon is made to be perfectly elastic, & that no energy is lost & no rise in temperature takes place inside the balloon. All other asasumptions are the same as in the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases.    Work done to inflate a small volume of the balloon, dW=P*dV   ( pressure is constant due to the material of the balloon being perfectly elastic).  So, work done to inflate the whole balloon would be the integration of P*dV, over the limits V1 to V2, V1 & V2 are the initial & final volumes respectively..  Thus, W=P*V2 - P*V1                =PV2 - P*0 (if there is no gas initially inside the balloon, hence its initial volume is 0)                  =PV2                = n*R*T2|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	Bravo, Prashant!     But, depending on the level of study that the questioner is at, the answer probably requires integration. Here's an answer that might get zero marks, if this is not what is wanted!    That air in the balloon cannot be zero to begin with.   Let it be v at the start (uninflated) with air at atmospheric pressure p.   And V at the end with pressure P.    Assume temperature does not change.    Work required is just (average pressure)*(volume change).    Work, W = (p + P)(V-v)/2    This also assumes linear increase of pressure with volume.   (Not in opposition to Boyle's Law which is for a fixed mass of gas, because you are blowing in increasing masses of air all the time.)

AA10467151	Stem cells are cells that are able to differentiate into specialized cell types but also retain the ability to renew themselves through cell division.    Stem cells were first identified in embryos. In an embryonic blastocyst, stem cells of the inner cell mass proceed to develop into all of the tissues and organs of the body.    In adults, progenitor cells and possibly multipotent adult stem cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing more specialized cells. The existence of truly pluripotent stem cells in adult humans beings is still scientifically controversial.    The status of the human embryo and human embryonic stem cell research is a controversial issue as, with the present state of technology, the creation of a human embryonic stem cell line requires the destruction of a human embryo. Stem cell debates have motivated and reinvigorated the pro-life movement whose members have concerned themselves with the rights and status of the embryo as an early-aged human life. They believe that embryonic stem cell research instrumentalizes and violates the sanctity of life and constitutes murder. The fundamental assertion of those who oppose embryonic stem cell research is the belief that human life is inviolable, combined with the opinion that human life begins when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell to form a single cell.    Most stem cell researchers use embryos that were created but not used in in vitro fertility treatments to derive new stem cell lines. Most of these embryos are slated to be destroyed, or stored indefinitely. In the United States alone, there have been estimates of at least 400,000 such embryos.  This has led some opponents of abortion, such as Senator Orrin Hatch, to support human embryonic stem cell research.|`|zvCWh3RSaa	"Stem-cell" research is research done using stem cells, which are cells that can become any type of cell in the body when activated by the right conditions. There are two ways to obtain them. One, the most controversial, is by creating a zygote in a test tube and allowing it to grow until the stem cells have developed, then ending the growth cycle. The second way is to use stem cells that are found either in adults or in the umbilical cord. Advocates of the first method declare that stem cells obtained from adults have been altered because they have already been exposed to all the same diseases, mutations, and conditions as the adult. So far, stem cells have not been used for medical purposes on anyone; they are only used for research. But many in the medical community believe these cells will be able to unlock the cures to many diseases (such as Parkinson's).|`|AA11502176	the undifferentiated early cells in a fertalized egg. These cells grow incredibly and become our whole body. We want to tell them what to grow into, not just grow into all the parts of the human body and not as a whole body cause then it would be a person and you can't have thier organs. The stem cells are taken almost from the dumpster of the abortion clinic, recycled if you will. And women discard eggs always (28 days), we could use them to grow organs. you'd just flush it.    we could just grow whole clones or even sons and harvest thier organs, may even be more efficient if you get a whole set of organs for every embryo instead of just one heart.    still, if we get to understanding (using abortion waste) we could create mass production of just the stem cell from no egg at all. They split anyway so just keep some to always make more of the blank slate cells and use the others as you would.

Same goes for those that make up the spinal column and the brain....  if enough are damaged, there's really no way to come back.  However, scientists have been able to prove that stem cells, because they are able to become any type of cell through manipulation, could solve many problems and cure many diseases.

As resinas de troca i?nica s?o polmeros organicos geralmente sulfonados e derivados do estireno e do divinilbenzeno, na forma d pekenas partculas  quase sempre esfricas (diametro   O processo consiste em passar a gua atravs d um leito dessas partculas, qdo ent?o os ctions e anions presentes na gua v?o deslocando e substituindo gradativamente os ons hidrognio e hidroxila ativos das mesmas, at satur-las, ou seja, at q n?o haja + ons H+ e OH- p/  serem substitudos: nesse ponto, a resina tem q ser regenerada, isto , tratada quimicamente d modo a c recuperar sua capacidade d troca i?nica; o processo d regenera??o  exatamente o inverso da opera??o, quer  dizer, promove a substitui??o, nas partculas das resinas, dos ctions e anions seqestrados durante a opera??o normal por ons H+ e OH-, respectivamente. A deioniza??o isoladamente n?o produz gua totalmente pura, pelos  seguintes motivos: a) h fuga d pequenos fragmentos d resina do sistema durante a opera??o; b) a gua estagnada nos tanques e cartuchos promove excessivo crescimento bacteriano; c) n?o remove alguns compostos organicos;  d) n?o remove toda a matria organica dissolvida na gua d alimenta??o e, d fato, essa matria organica pode colmatar (cobrir e bloquear) a resina. Portanto, deve-se combinar a deioniza??o c/ outros processos d purifica??o p/ c conseguir o grau d pureza d gua necessrio p/ pesquisa e anlises d maiores precis?o e sensibilidade.  Osmose Reversa: a osmose reversa pode ser melhor explicada aps c entender o processo natural da osmose q  o movimento da gua atravs d uma membrana semipermevel, do lado c/ menor concentra??o d impurezas (+ puro) p/ o lado d maior concentra??o d impurezas  (lado d maior salinidade, menos puro). Esse movimento continua at q as concentra??es atinjam o equilbrio ou q a press?o no lado + concentrado c torne alta o suficiente p/ impedir o fluxo   Filtra??o Atravs de Carv?o Ativado: remove o cloro por quimisor??o e as substancias organicas dissolvidas por adsor??o. Geralmente, o filtro d carv?o ativado  colocado nos sistemas d purifica??o d gua antes da osmose reversa e antes da deioniza??o, pois tanto as membranas d osmose  qto as resinas d troca i?nica s?o sensveis ao cloro e podem ser colmatadas pela matria organica dissolvida. Por outro lado, h kem prefira n?o colocar o filtro d carv?o antes das resinas, d modo a manter o cloro na gua e dificultar a prolifera??o microbiana nas resinas. Tb c costuma  colocar o filtro d carv?o ativado no ciclo d polimento dos sistemas d purifica??o d gua, p/ remo??o d tra?os d substancias organicas.

Esse processo permite obter gua c/ menos d 20 ppb (20 partes por bilh?o ou 0,02 mg/l) d carbono organico total. O cartucho d adsor??o organica pode conter resinas especiais e  carv?o ativado e  colocado geralmente no ciclo d polimento (pstratamento) do sistema d purifica??o.  Filtra??o Microporosa ou Submicr?nica: usa uma membrana ou fibra oca c/ porosidade d 0,2 micrometro q evita a passagem d qquer contaminante c/ diametro acima desse valor.

Outros cidos n?o tem uma libera??o de calor t?o intensa quando adicionados  gua, no entanto,  bom seguir esta regra para qualquer outro cido, esta  uma das regras de seguran?a em laboratrio, que acredito, devem ser seguidas  risca, pois, se elas existem, alguma raz?o lgica e preventiva h para isto.   Quando em contato com a gua, o cido ioniza-se com uma alta libera??o de calor.   Imagine uma quantidade grande de gua, onde voc introduz o cido. Este ir penetrar neste meio e ir liberar calor  medida que for se infiltrando na gua. Desta forma, o calor assim que liberado ser absorvido pela massa de gua presente, isto causar um aumento de sua temperatura gradativamente, at que se atinja o ponto de ebuli??o da gua.  Repare que desta forma,  medida que o cido entra na gua, ele pode ir se diluindo de forma gradual, do mais concentrado, que  o ponto de onde foi adicionado, para o menos concentrado, onde vai se diluindo com a gua. Ent?o a sua for?a para aquecer a gua vai diminuindo, no mesmo passo que sua concentra??o.  Se colocarmos gua sobre o cido, o inverso ocorrer:  a concentra??o de cido na gua  zero, o cido ir penetrar na gua assim que ela entrar em contato com ele, repare que n?o haver restri??es  passagem do cido pra a gua, o aquecimento ser rpido e incontrolvel, haver cido suficiente para que comece a ebuli??o da gua, e desta forma, as bolhas de vapor provenientes desta ebuli??o ir?o projetar cido para cima, podendo ocasionar respingos de cido aquecido, que  sempre mais reativo do que cido frio.

edf378d963b36e1b5712e7c396f6ddb7aa	Propriedade Gerais da Matria    S?o as propriedades da matria observadas em qualquer corpo, independente da substancia de que ele  feito.    Extens?o: Propriedade que a matria tem de ocupar um lugar no espa?o. O volume mede a extens?o de um corpo.      O espa?o da estante ficou totalmente preenchido pelos livros.    Inrcia: propriedade que a matria tem em permanecer na situa??o em que se encontra, seja em movimento, seja em repouso. Quanto maior for a massa de um corpo, mais difcil alterar seu movimento, e maior a inrcia. A massa mede a inrcia de um corpo.      Fotografia estroboscpica de motorista durante a parada de um carro. Com uma srie de instantaneos em intervalos sucessivos de tempo, permite o estudo detalhado do movimento do corpo. Observe a movimenta??o do motorista e a a??o do cinto de seguran?a.    Impenetrabilidade: Dois corpos n?o podem ocupar, simultaneamente o esmo lugar no espa?o.      O ar existente no interior do copo impede a entrada da gua a ponto de molhar o papel.    Compressibilidade: propriedade da matria que consiste em ter volume reduzido quando submetida a determinada press?o.      Compressibilidade do ar    Elasticidade: Propriedade que a matria tem de retornar seu volume inicial - aps cessada a for?a que causa a compress?o.      Elasticidade do ar    Divisibilidade: Propriedade que a matria tem se reduzir-se em partculas extremamente pequenas.      Divisibilidade da matria    Indestrutibilidade: A matria n?o pode ser criada nem destruda, apenas transformada.      Ao ser queimada a matria se trans  forma em gases, fuma?a e cinzas.      --------------------------------------...    Propriedades Especficas da Matria    S?o as propriedades que variam conforme as substancias de que a matria  feita.      --------------------------------------...    Cor:  Diferentes materiais apresentam diferentes cores.         As cores caractersticas de cada substancia.    Dureza:  definida pela resistncia que a superfcie oferece quando riscada por outro material. A substancia mais dura que se conhece  o diamante, usado para cortar e riscar materiais como o vidro.      O papel  mais duro que o grafite, que se desgasta ao ser riscado pelo papel.    Brilho:  a propriedade que faz com que os corpos reflitam a luz de modo diferente.    Maleabilidade: Propriedade que permite  matria ser moldada. Existem materiais maleveis e n?o-maleveis.         Artesanato em madeira e em ferro.    Ductilidade: Propriedade que permite transformar materiais em fios. Um exemplo  o cobre, usado em forma de fios em instala??es eltricas e o ferro na fabrica??o de arames.      Por ser um bom condutor de eletricidade, o cobre  usado como fio que conecta os aparelhos as tomadas.    Densidade:  tambm chamada de massa especfica de uma substancia, pe a raz?o (d) entre a massa dessa substancia e o volume por ela ocupado.                           A diferen?a na densidade permite que os corpos biem - o homem e o iceberg. A gua quando congelada aumenta de volume.

Ao descrevermos uma pessoa, por exemplo, referimo-nos s suas propriedades: sua altura, aparncia, disposi??o, habilidades; semelhantemente, todas as espcies de matria apresentam propriedades, e do mesmo modo que algum pode ser identificado pela rela??o de suas propriedades, determinada espcie de matria o pode ser por intermdio de suas caractersticas. Na verdade,  mais fcil discutir a matria em termos de suas propriedades do que explicar a sua natureza final,             As propriedades da matria podem ser divididas em duas categorias: as que podem ser determinadas sem altera??o essencial da substancia, e aquelas que s se evidenciam quando a substancia sofre intera??o com outra forma de matria.             A ltima classe de propriedades, que exigem uma mudan?a na composi??o da matria, inclui as chamadas propriedades qumicas, enquanto que as primeiras, em que n?o h necessidade disto, s?o chamadas propriedades fsicas. Por  exemplo, a capacidade de uma substancia de queimar-se  uma propriedade qumica, enquanto que o seu ponto de fus?o  uma propriedade fsica.             O nmero de propriedades que pode ser enumerado para uma substancia  virtualmente infinito. Os manuais especializados de Fsica e Qumica dedicam centenas de pginas ao relacionamento das propriedades de vrias formas de matria. Da mesma maneira que existem novas facetas do carter de uma pessoa, para as quais ela n?o est alertada, os cientistas constantemente est?o descobrindo novas propriedades da matria.             Em vez de catalogar aqui as propriedades fsicas da matria com que entraremos em contato,  melhor discuti-las  medida que forem surgindo. Mas, no estudo da Fsica,  importante reconhecer o fato de que, se uma propriedade n?o pode ser medida e comparada com alguma espcie de padr?o, n?o tem utilidade para o cientista: Sem medida n?o pode existir Cincia, e quanto mais precisamente se possa medir determinada propriedade, mais completa ser a descri??o da matria.|`|Tq62KIpDaa	a propiedade eu acho q s?o os elemento e contituem a materi como o Ferro  = a F|`|bc23c36d9b575cb97bb5207f7bb31970aa	Propriedade no sentido de caractersticas prprias da matria.

Now using Columb's formula for electric force between two dot charges, we have F = (9*10^9)(q1q2/r^2), where q1 and q2 are magnitudes of the charges, r is distance of their centers, and F is the electric force.   Calculations are too easy to do!    b) With the cable connected the spheres, some of the charges will move through it and the net charge remained in each sphere will be -3c, because of difference of potential in two spheres. Again u can use Columb's formula just like the part a, noting that the charges are different here.    Hope this helped.
AA12059706	Well, we define acceleration as a change in velocity (a change in speed and/or direction).  In order for an object to move in a circle, it must constantly be accelerating towards the center; changing direction to keep its circular path.  Now the centripetal force isn't a real force, but feels like it.  Generally, the centripetal force is provided by a tension force, for instance if you were to hang the mass on the end of a string, then swing the string around.  Your wrist will pull on the string, creating tension that will pull on the mass.  If you try this, you'll notice that you have to keep pulling the mass towards the center.  That tension is the "centripetal force."    We express centripetal acceleration as a=v2/r, where r is the radius of the string, a is the acceleration needed to keep the mass moving in a circle, and v is the velocity (or speed) tangential to the circular path it follows.    Then, by Newton's second law (F=ma), the centripetal force is just mv2/r.|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	Look up your notes or textbook. This is very simple.

Ideal Polaroid filters have more densely packed crystals of iodoquinine sulphate embedded per unit area in the plastic medium that holds them together. This is the optically active substance that causes the polarisation and selection of which plane of vibrations to allow or disallow to pass through.    They are fairly expensive. One pair of 4" x 4" squares cost around $50 because they give total extinction when crossed. This is unlike, say, polaroid sunglasses which shouldn't let the view disappear altogether!    I hope this is what you want to know, rather than the usual data in textbooks that deal with the vibrations and the planes they vibrate within.

Find the postition of the centre of mass (c.m.) first.    If this is x away from the 45 kg mass, then     45*x = 75*(1.7 - x)      2.   Next, find the angular velocity = (omega). One revolution is 2(pi) radians, so the angular velocity is 2(pi)/3 rad per second.    3.  Then get the moment of inertia of the two masses about the axis through the c.m. because they are rotating about the c.m.  Take them as point masses. One is 45x^2, the other 75*(1.7-x)^2. Total MI = sum of these two.    4.  Angular momentum = Moment of Inertia*angular velocity.       Find the value for each ice skater and then add together for total angular momentum about their centre of mass.    5. (a)    Kinetic energy is either angular kinetic energy                =  0.5(MI)(omega)^2    OR  (b)  Find the individual linear velocities of their circular motion.  Each velocity is (omega)*(distance from c.m.)  Then find k.e. of each mass  =  0.5(mass)(velocity)^2.  Add up the two values of k.e. for total k.e. of the system.    The answer for (b) is the same as the one for (a) anyway. Just two ways of finding it.

AA11614996	Hi:     Your not the only one who not good at doing math, There are a lot of people who struggle with it. Men have struggled with it for 5,000 years. In fact you should see now the Ancients did there Math lol . However I don't think that you can't do Mathematics,  It's  the way they been teaching you it. However Here my advice on learning Math:     Rule 1 :     Read the the problem through until you understand it     Rule 2:     Find out what the problem is asking you to solve for.    Rule 3:     Write down what is given , like variables terms, equation and write what your sloving for ( I give you a example below)     Rule 4:     Set up your problem based on rule   3.     Rule 5:     Rearrange the equation or formula if necessary ( write down step by step; what operation your using to solve the problem. ) if you have to arrange it from the orignal equation .    Rule 6:     Write down step by step; what operation your using to solve the problem along with the action your doing. And take your time doing it . Don't rush through it   -this will make it easier for you to back track and trouble shoot what you did wrong; if the results don't work out.     Rule 7     WATCH THE SIGNS ON THE NUMBERS OR VARIABLE - (I use Caps to make this very import point because a lot people - Me included -  often make this mistake) -     Double check all addition, substraction, multipication, division, roots and powers especially with sign on them.  They do make a difference in your answer  - Trust me on this one     Make sure there that your signs are  right.  Unless you cancel them somewhere and sometime they do come back.      Also don't worry about negative signs ( Just work the problem through. It will work out, Okay - A lot people worry about this too much )       Rule 8:     When you finally get your answer, Prove your answer by writing "Proof:" and repeat rule 3 through 7 ( see the example below )     Rule 9:     If answers on the proof equal each other than move on to the next problem if not; back track and find out where you made your error and correct it  than redo the problem again at that point and redo proof again with the corrected result      Rule 10:     When you got extra time; check your problem again      example :     John need a box to hold 200 cubic inch of water (remember that V= s^3 ; s is in inches) . How big should the side of the box be?     1. Follow rule   1     Rule 2 :     Given     V= s ^ 3 , V= 200 inches, and where are sloving for s     Rule 3 through 7:     V = s^3 - orginal equation     200 = s^3 - subsittution     cube root (200) = cube root (s ^ 3) - using the inverse of a cube on both sides of the equation  to remove the cube,  to slove for s     5.848036 = s ( solving the cube root and I rounded it to 6 decimal place for the numberic part )     s = 5.848036 inches - Rearranged the problem and add the unit     Rule 8:    Proof :     Prove that s^3 = 200 when s = 5.848036 inches and V= 200 cubic inches is true for the equation V= s^3     Rule 2     Given:     V= s^3, s = 5.848036 , V= 200       Rule 3 though 7:       V= s^3 - orginal equation     200 = 5.848036 ^ 3 - substutition     200 = 200 - Doing the cube of  s     200 = 200 - it equal and it check out       do rule   9 & 10     Of course don't write the rules down but do write down what you did like the above example shows you       This will help you and keep you from making mistakes before you finallize your answer .Granted it's a lot of writing  and consume much time but it will catch your mistake and a lot of right answers is better than funking the test to a lot of wrong answers.      Also if you don't know or understand  how to do a problem. Ask someone who does - Like your treacher , best friend,  a tutor, or a kid who is good at math to explain it to you until you get it . Explain where your lost on it.           Hopefully math will be as easy for you as your other subjects     I hope this helps|`|sbB553Lxaa	You'll need to practice working out many problems, and try to indentify the type(s) of math problems you have problems with.

For the first, think:  48 ft = 12 in,                     so 48 ft / x = 12 in / (1/4)                                   x = 1 ft    For the second, think:  4 women can do 2 rooms in one day, so they can do 4 rooms in two days.  So to get all 12 rooms done in two days it takes three times as many women. so answer = 3 * 4 =12 women.

IUmAflSqaa	Yeah, I think the solution given for the 215 case generalizes nicely.    1. Look mod 4.  y^2 = 0 or 1 mod 4, while x^3 = 0, 1, or 3 mod 4.  (2k)^3 = 0 mod 4, so y^2 = x^3-1 = 3, 0, or 2 mod 4, whence y^2 = 0 mod 4 and x^3 = 1 mod 4.  This also implies x = 1 mod 4.    2. Note y^2+1 = x^3+(2k)^3 = (x+2k)(x^2-2kx+(2k^2)).  Since k is odd, 2k = 2 mod 4, and so x+2k = 3 mod 4.  We must have x > -2k because x3+(2k)^3-1 = y^2 > 0, so x+2k > 0.  Thus we can conclude that x+2k has a prime factor p so that p = 3 mod 4, and hence y^2+1 is divisible by p.    3. But then y^2 = -1 mod p, which is a contradiction, as y^2 = -1 mod p has a solution only if p = 2 or p = 1 mod 4.

They give you the amount of flour, 120g. They also give you the total amount in the mix, 400g.    This means, 120g of the 400g of biscuit mix is flour. Expressed as a fraction this is: 120/400.

So then you see how much of that is flour, which is 120.  So you take 120 and divide it by 400 which = 0.3  Then to turn it into a percentage, times it by 100 because percentages are out of 100.   So 0.3 x 100 = 30, so theres your answer. 30%|`|FYpWi4Vwaa	30 %    the total is 400g and the flour is only 120g. Well, we know that 100g would be 25% so it would have to be a little more than that.

w2nfvZ0caa	First, know that " = 22/7" (since they want you to use "22/7" instead of "" in your calculation).    The problem tells you that the circumference is "172.7m". The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is:    Circumference = 2*radius    Since the the diameter is twice the radius, the formula can be simplified:    C = diameter *     Since "22/7 = ", swap "" out of the equation:    C = diameter * (22/7)    You also know what the circumference is in the problem, so substitute that in as well:    172.7m = diameter * (22/7)    Divide each side by "22/7" to solve for your diameter:    54.95m = diameter    I hope this helped you out. :P

No entanto, para um coleccionador, a nica hiptese de possuir um diamante na sua colec??o  efectivamente compr-lo, dado que o comrcio deste mineral  quase totalmente controlado por grandes empresas que tm o monoplio da venda de diamantes e atribui??o do seu valor comercial.    Os diamantes s?o extrados principalmente da ex-URSS, frica do Sul e Zaire, que juntos contribuem com mais de 3/5 da produ??o mundial. Outros produtores importantes incluem o Botswana, a China, o Brasil, Angola e Nambia. No entanto tambm se encontram alguns diamantes nos EUA (Arkansas, Virgnia, Wisconsin e Califrnia). A ndia, que era o nico produtor de diamante antes do sculo XVIII, tem agora uma quota bastante reduzida na produ??o. Tambm j se encontraram estes cristais em meteoritos.    Aplica??es e valor  S os diamantes incolores ou com matizes bonitos constituem pedras preciosas, que se utilizam em joalharia, montados em metais preciosos e/ou em associa??o com outras gemas.    O interesse popular nos diamantes centra-se no seu valor como gemas, mas os cristais tm ainda uma maior importancia como ferramentas industriais. As variedades negras e microcristalinas, n?o tendo valor comercial, utilizam-se na indstria como abrasivos de alta qualidade ou como ferramentas de talha ou como perfuradores para materiais de dureza elevada. Estes podem ser usados para cortar, tornear e furar alumina, quartzo, vidro e artigos ceramicos. O p de diamante  usado para polir a?os e outras ligas.    Talha  O valor do diamante reside na ausncia total de impurezas e de cor.    Uma vez seleccionados, os diamantes s?o cortados e talham-se ao longo de direc??es nas quais a dureza  menor. Uma talha bem realizada  aquela que real?a o foco, ou seja, o conjunto de reflexos de cores derivados da dispers?o da luz branca no interior da gema.    Diamantes sintticos  Actualmente, existe a possibilidade de fazer diamantes sintticos, submetendo grafite a press?es elevadas. No entanto, o resultado s?o quase sempre cristais de dimens?es demasiado reduzidas para poderem ser comercializados como gemas. O risco de se adquirir um diamante artificial  quase nulo, sendo inclusivamente inferior  possibilidade de encontrar gemas que os comerciantes dizem ser diamante mas que n?o o s?o realmente.    Embora j em 1880 J. Balentine Hannay, um qumico escocs, tivesse produzido minsculos cristais, s em 1955 cientistas da General Electric Company conseguiram um mtodo eficaz para a sntese de diamantes artificiais. Este feito foi creditado a Francis Bundy, Tracy Hall, Herbert M. Strong e Robert H. Wentorf, depois de investiga??es efectuadas por Percy W. Bridgeman na Universidade de Harvard. Os diamantes assim conseguidos eram de qualidade industrial sendo hoje em dia produzidos em larga escala. Cristais com a qualidade de pedras preciosas, s se conseguiram sintetizar em 1970 por Strong e Wentorf, num processo que exige press?es e temperaturas extremamente elevadas.|`|dyetibq1aa	organiza??o querrida...  organiza??o estrutural...|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Porque ele est sempre excitado.|`|nJ93CfCnaa	Amiga Maysa, o diamante  formado do mesmo material do lpis de escrever (carv?o de pedra) s que o diamante fica milhares de anos por baixo da terra.

It may be less confusing to write it like this for some triangle ABC:  (a - b) / (a + b) = tan[(A - B)/2] / tan[(A + B)/2]    Now, the wikipedia article claims that you can use it to solve a triangle when 2 sides and an angle are known.  However, it's my expectation that you'd have to change it back to essentially the law of sines to do this.    As for your question about whether there is a case when you have to use the law of tangents, I have two things to point out:  (1) tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), so anything plaguing both sine and cosine should also be a problem for tangent.  (2) The wikipedia article actually derives this from the law of sines.    -------    Again, it's a neat formula - it might even simplify some awkward expressions involving tan(x), but as far as solving a triangle goes, I'd stick with the laws of sines/cosines.

RxukJqL5aa	I think the best way to verify that it is the cover relation of a partially ordered set is to draw the Hasse diagram. You'll end up getting something like a regular hexagon oriented so that there is a vertex pointing up.    Then, we want to find how many ways we can turn it into a line, while still preserving "above" and "below" on the Hasse diagram we have.    Well, the top and bottom (d and a, resp.) won't change.  However, we have 4 spots on the line between them - choose 2 of them and then place b,c in them.  Then place e,f into the other two remaining, so there are only 4C2 = 6 linear extensions.

Isso faz com que a distribui??o do "momentum" seja mair equitativo e n?o se fa?a num espa?o muito curto de tempo, o que pode ser muito acre para um atirador inexperiente.  Lembrando que a grandeza definida como "momentum" equivale  massa x velocidade do projtil.  Se um projtil com 830 m/s de velocidade e com 32 gramas de massa (.475 Weatherby Mag) for disparado gera um momentum de:    830 x 0,032= 26,56 m/s*kg    Essa for?a arremessa um homem de 70 Kg a uma velocidade de 2, 63 m/s ou 26,56/70 !

O verme supostamente teria um corpo com muitos espinhos e poderia descarregar descargas eltricas  distancia.    Ivan Mackerle, um explorador da Checoslovquia tentou fazer com que o verme viesse  superfcie usando explosivos, mas n?o teve sucesso.

ossCVxPqaa	Yes. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity - not the rate of change of speed. If you move in a straight line with constant speed, you also have constant velocity. However, if you then change direction, while maintaining the constant speed, you are accelerating in the new direction. The most obvious illustration of this is to travel around a circular path at constant speed. As the direction is constantly changing, the velocity is changing therefore the body is accelerating. |`|8a4knLsSaa	I think not. Acceleration is by definition a changing speed.    Unless you want to be a smart @ss about it and talk about relative bodies and all that, no. Both measurements should be taken from the same relative positions if they are talked about like that in the same sentence.|`|B4hB1vdAaa	yes.  that can happen only when a rigid body is having circular orbitals.    when a rigid body is having rotational velocity, the rotational acceleration changes together with it, via the equation, acceleration=(mass)/(velocity^2)    hope this helps!(:|`|m09snBrEaa	if you count gravity's effect on it as acceleration sure, in that case your butt is accelerating into your seat even though your not moving in that direction.|`|rITKc8kKaa	yes, if it changes direction of travel but not the 'speed'.|`|uwpu0ZbIaa	like if your driving in your car at a constant speed and then you lean forward in your seat then your body just accelerated faster than the car but then if you lean back then you're actualy going slower than the car.

1e95b2d150d6e44d2e08ca1489ee91f1aa	NO, it has not been proven that time dilation even exists. Gravity effects CLOCKS not time. Although the methods they use vary, all oscillating clocks(mechanical, digital and atomic) work similarly and can be divided into analogous parts. Different gravity and speeds can effect the oscillation, therefore it can not accurately be measured under such conditions, even in atomic clocks.|`|T9vf2uU7aa	Time travel is evident here and now in the world we live in.  It's just relative, that's all.  Wormholes are one possible method of time travel, since not only would they be two interconnected regions of space, but also of time.  Stability is the issue with the wormhole though, since quantum effects could break down the "passageway" before any travelers could get through, resulting in a very messy and unpleasant end.  Though, since we don't have the technology to experiment with them yet, pretty much all of this is based on equations and speculation.|`|N9CtBJnnaa	in theory time travel is possible.  the theory of relativity suggests that the faster an object goes(in relation to the speed of light), time slows down with it.  so, as we approach light speed, time will slow down, and obviously, once at light speed, time will stop completely. so theoretically, if we were to go faster than light, we should ne going back in time.  however, this is not possible. to achieve light speed, we must need an infinite source of energy, which cannot be obtained. so it is impossible to go even faster than that.|`|zILwtO22aa	Just a thought reading your question, how do you know that in the future you did go back, then forgot the future for some reason, then had to live your life over again, does it bear thinking about..??..uumm?|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I can't see any way in which it could ever be possible.

K6QlFoo0aa	First let's look at 3x * (sin^2(4))    Since sin^2(4) is a constant this is the same as any other constant and we have to differentiate:    (3 * sin^2(4)) * x    That is just (3 * sin^2(4))......    Now let's look at the sec(x) which is defined as 1 / cos(x) = [cos(x)]^(-1)]    The internal derivative (of cos(x)) is -sin(x) so that is one factor.  "anything" to the power (-1) when differentiated is - ("anything")^-2, so we get:    -sin(x) * (-1 / [cos(x)]^2..... The two minus signs cancel each other and we get:    sin(x) / [cos(x)]^2.....That is probably not the form that they want so factor that into:    [(sin(x) / cos(x)] * [1 / cos(x)] = tan(x) * sec(x)..    Adding these two parts together we get:    dh/dt = [3 * sin^2(4))] + [tan(x) * sec(x)].....  ---------------    g = (3 + tan(x)) /x    Quotient Rule:   d(u/v)/dx = [v*(du/dx) - (u*dv/dx)] / (v^2)    u = 3 + tan(x)  du/dx = sec^2(x)...    v = x  dv/dx = 1    v * du/dx = [x * sec^2(x)]  u * dv/dx = 3 + tan(x)    v^2 = x^2    The derivative is:    dg/dt = {[x * sec^2(x)] - [3 + tan(x)]} / (x^2)...  -------------------

VLT2VgP9aa	So, you need an endomorphism which is surjective, but not injective.  Since a surjective mapping from a finite structure to itself is guaranteed to be injective, you'll have to use an infinite structure.      Consider the R[x], the group of all polynomials with real coefficients under addition.  Define a homomorphism h which assigns polynomials in R[x] to their derivative.  To check that this is a homomorphism, notice that    h(f + g) = (f + g)' = f' + g' = h(f) + h(g)    To check that it's surjective, notice that for every polynomial f in R[x], there is a polynomial F in R[x] such that F' = f (F is the antiderivative of f).  So, if f is in R[x], then h(F) = F' = f.    Finally, to see that this isn't injective, notice that Ker(h) contains all constant polynomials in R[x].  That is, for any f = a and g = b, where a and b are not equal, h(f) = h(g) = 0.
n8rE9gs3aa	Ya there is a link...         In case of prob of 2 events(drawing 2 cards) occuring simultaneously, the total number of cases(denominator) will always be same Example: in the case of drawing 2 cards the possible cases for both cards(ie denominator) will be same 52       In the case of drawing 2 cards from a deck successively without replacement, while considering the first card the possible number of cases would be 52 and while considering the 2nd card the possible no of cases( ie denominator) will be 51 since the first card is not replaced|`|k8OmO5Khaa	It all depends on the events if they are independent or not. First in general, as I can understand from your statements, it does not make a difference if you draw the cards simultaneously ( which implies no replacement) or successively with out replacement.     Here the events are not independent as the outcome of one event influences the outcome of the other.    It is easy to solve this as follows. Assume both have to be king. The probability is 4/52 * 3/51. The probability both are not king is 1 - 4/52 * 3/51|`|v5otljOxaa	The answer would be (4*3)/(52*51)

You've got part a) right.    b) Flight Time should be 1.089 secs which is easily calculated by solving  y = uyt + ?ayt^2  0 = 4.65 t - 4.9t^2 + 0.75    c) Accordingly horizontal displacement (Range) will be 10.86 m    d) Ans to d is Yes. The athlete will travel a further distance if he takes off at 30 deg.  If the center of gravity was same at the take off and landing, he would cover maximum distance if he took off at 45 deg.    Whether it is practically possible for an athlete to do this stunt is not the question. We are only discussing physics (projectile motion) here and the possibilities.
EbxMItf8aa	You are working with the Normal Distribution, so you first have to convert your data values into the units used in the normal distribution.    This is the reason why the Normal Distribution can be used with any set of data, whatever the units of measurement used (assuming that the data is normally distributed in the first place, of course.)    The normal distribution is centred around the mean, so you centre your data around the mean value, by subtracting  (the mean value) from each of the measured values.    Then you have to express this in terms of the standard deviation, so you divide the result by  (the standard deviation).  This gives you a z-value, which is the parameter used in the Normal Distribution.    In brief,  z  =  (x -  ) /     Tables of the Normal Distribution give the areas under the curve for different values of z.  For a 95% confidence interval, you want to know the z-values between which there is 95% of the area of the curve.    These z-values are -1.96 to +1.96; if you want to convert them back into the same measurements used for your original data, work the above formula backwards :    You want the values of x which give you the z-values -1.96 and +1.96, i. e.    (x - 30.0555) / 7.82071  =  -1.96    from which you get that x = 14.7269    and  (x - 30.0555) / 7.82071  =  +1.96    from which you get that x = 45.3841    So, in other words, 95% of your data values will be between 14.727 and 45.384.    --------------------------------------...    You also mention standard error.  This comes in when you have a number of different samples, which give you several different mean values.  Which one or ones are nearer the true mean?    You use the several values for the mean as a set of data in their own right. They are all estimates of the true mean, and they have their own Normal Distribution.  The mean of these estimates is, of course, the same as the true mean of the data you are examining, but since they are the result of a set of data points, they will cluster more closely to the true mean than the individual data points themselves.    The standard deviation of a set of different estimates of the mean, therefore, is smaller than the standard deviation of just one set of measurements of the raw data.  This reduced standard deviation is the standard error of the mean, and its value depends upon the number of measurements in the sample - the more measurements you  take, the smaller the standard error becomes.    Your texts (or your tutors) should be giving you more detail on all these matters.|`|ae92e8a121c399eb3751b67c6557c92aaa	Look up your distribution table (Gaussian).    95% confidence interval  (300552.4, 300557.6)|`|5sCpMpbWaa	am not sure of these sums but this link really helped me.    www.help.com

im3vWyv6aa	My daughter just got first place for her Science Fair project. She tested 11 different kinds of glue on 4 different surfaces. Her dad went to Carter Lumber and bought a strip of plastic, wood, metal and rubber. She glued 11 popsicle sticks to each surface strip (each stick was glued using a different glue) and let them dry overnight. Before you glue the sticks on put a tack at one end (this is needed for hanging a bucket on the end). She hung a tiny bucket at the end of the stick. Then she used pennies as weights. She dropped pennies one by one until the stick broke away from the surface. Count the pennies and use a food scale to weigh them. The key is charts and graphs...    Or - my oldest daughter won Best of Show a couple years ago for testing fresh cut flowers and how to keep them alive the longest.

The x value is found by the formula -b/2a. Since a = 1 and b = 4 the x value is equal to -4/2 or -2. You must replace the -2 into original problem. Therefore, (-2)2+4(-2)+6 = 2. The minimum value is 2.    2. You need to use the discriminant to find the type of solutions. The discriminant is equal to b2 - 4ac. Since a = 1, b = 4 and c = 6, the discriminant is equal to (4)2 - 4(1)(6) = 16 - 24 = -8. SInce the discriminant is less than 0 you have two non-real solutions.

That equation tells us that the radius of the circle is 3, which is the only piece of information that we need.  Using the formula for the area of a circle, we have (3)^2 = 9.    2.  Remember that sin A is opposite/hypotenuse.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the square of the length of the adjacent side is    13^2 - 10^2 = 169 - 100 = 69    So the length of the adjacent side is sqrt(69).  So, cos A = sqrt(69)/13.    3.  a|b-2||`|t6mdWVXkaa	1. The formula for the equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.  Here, (h,k) is the center of the circle and r is the length of the radius.  So, in your equation:    h = 2  k = -2  r = 3 (since r^2 = 9)    Use that radius to find the area.  I'm sure you can do that much!|`|RxukJqL5aa	1 and 2 are very straight-forward.    For 1: The area of a circle is given by r^2, where r is the radius.  What is the radius of our circle?    For 2: Draw a right triangle with angle A and that value for sinA. (hint: opposite is 10, hypotenuse is 13)  Find out what the adjacent side's length is.    3 is slightly more interesting.  |b-2| will be positive as long as b is different from 2.  At b=2, the expression becomes 0  Hence let b be some other value, so we can divide by |b-2| to get  a   That's the answer, then:  a|`|kz7KCpthaa	1) The graph of the equation (x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9 fits the standard equation of a circle, which is formally defined as (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.  To express the area of the enclosed circle in terms of PIE, you can easily substitute the radius of the circle into the formula of A = PIE * (r)^2.  Thus, the area of the enclosed circle is:   A = (3.14159265358979323845935) * ((x - 2)(y+2))^2 = (xy - 2x - 2y - 4)^2 * (3.14159265358979323845935) = (x^2 - 4x + 4)(y^2 + 4y + 4)(3.14) = x^2(y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4x(y^2 + 4y + 4) + 4(y^2 + 4y + 4) * PIE = x^2y^2 + 4x^2y + 4x^2 - 4xy^2 - 16xy - 16x + 4y^2 + 16y + 16 * PIE.      Since sin A = 10/13 = OPP/HYP, the Pythagorean Theorem enables one to intuitively obtain the side adjacent to the acute angle via the formula of c^2 = a^2 + b^2 => (13)^2 = (a)^2 + (10)^2 => a = squareRootOf(69).  Thus, cos A = squareRootOf(69) / 13.      With a = squareRootOf(69) && b = 10, you obtain an inequality of (squareRootOf(69))|8| > 0, which is the negation of the previous inequality.    J.C
2lQ8DJAcaa	Stone Mountain is an exposed granitic pluton, located in Northeast Georgia. Uniformitarian estimates suggest that the granite was intruded into overlying metamorphic rocks during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny. Later the mountain became exposed at the earth's surface. The uniformitarian model for the formation of Stone Mountain remains unresolved. This paper presents an interpretation, using the young earth Flood model, for the origin of Stone Mountain which would predict its formation and exposure during the Flood event.

IUmAflSqaa	Are you saying keep x real?  Then you CAN define x^x to be continuous, as you can define for x     x^x = exp(x(log|x|+i)) = (cos(x)+i*sin(x))|x|^x    But this choice is not unique--I could have taken instead:    x^x = exp(x(log|x|-i)) = (cos(x)-i*sin(x))|x|^x    The problem here is explained well by considering how you can define z^z for complex values z.  The natural definition is:    z^z = exp(z log(z))    But then this begs the question... what is log(z)?  The "natural" thing to do is to take some branch of the log function, say for z = re^(it):    log(z) = log(re^(it)) = log(r)+it    where -     exp(log(1/2)/2+i/2) = i/sqrt(2)    On the other hand, as z approaches 1/2 from below, we have log(z) approaches log(1/2)-i, and so exp(z log(z)) approaches:    exp(log(1/2)/2-i/2) = -i/sqrt(2)    So this can't be continuous.  And I'm dubious that you could fix it--you'd have to construct a wacky, noncontinuous version of the complex logarithm that somehow makes things match up nicely.  Whatever that means.

I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.-Nikola Tesla

NSQaDOhYaa	Yes, your image in a plane mirror appears the same distance behind the mirror as you are in front of it. If that distance changes - whether you or the mirror moves, it makes no difference - the apparent distance between you and the image will change by twice as much. It gives the same effect as your twin who walks at the same speed as you (but has transposed features!) approaching you in the street, and therefore appears perfectly normal.    So the relative velocity of you and your image is twice that of you and the mirror. And on the subject of speeds and velocities, your dimensions are quite correct, although I find the modern usage (m.s^-1) rather cumbersome and sometimes resort to the convention of my (far-distant) youth (m/s).|`|TwAFL2f5aa	Um. It's the same.  Think about it, any movement you make, the mirror makes. If you approach at 1m/s^-1 (and by the way, that makes no sense, I assume you mean 1m/s^2 -- Meter per second squared, which is an acceleration, not a speed)    Either way, your mirror image will go the same speed as you, always. The mirror never moves, you move closer to the mirror. To calculate total distance closing, it's the total distance, minus 2x your velocity.

hHVMrnK3aa	2096 is between 2048 and 4096  So you'd save yourself a lot of trouble by not including 48 rats, but never mind.    You need 12 bits.    Assuming you're clipping the nails on the rats themselves,  and they have at least 3 nails per foot, you're good to go.    Select 12 of their little itty bitty nails and number them from 0 - 11.    For each nail you either clip or don't clip (1 bit per nail).  That gives you 2^12 = 4096 different ID numbers.    For example:  (no, clip, no), (clip, clip, clip), (no, no, no), (no, no, clip)  would be rat number  010 111 000 001 = (octal) 2 7 0 1 = (decimal) 1473    If they don't have 12 nails, then you need to assign more than one bit per nail and clip to different lengths.  But since the problem specifies binary, I'll guess they have 12 nails.    For a bigger experiment you could include tail, ears, etc. if that didn't mess things up.    It's probably easier to just paint numbers on their backs.

AA11474133	So you want us to do your stupid math homework?    Not completely sure what you are asking.  How many ways can you add up 8's and 3's and get 200?  Like if 2's and 3's to sum 10:  2+2+3+3  2+2+2+2+2    guess it is 2 ways.  Is that the idea?    Then 3x+8y=200 where x is the number of 3's and y is the number of 8's.  X and Y have to be non-negative integers.  How many solutions are there?  Solve that for y=25-3x/8.  Since y has to be an integer, this limits your choices of x.  What does it take for 3x/8 to be an integer.  How about being a multiple of 8.  Now there aren't so many to try.  Find how many x's will give you a valid y, and you'll have your answer.

To find the square root of a number is a very hard thing to do in general.  Usually an approximation is good enough or it acceptable to leave it as a square root of a number.  To get an approximation it easier to work the opposite way.  To do this I try to memorize some squares ( like multiples of 5 and 10 and also the numbers 1 through 9) and the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2*a*b + b^2.  15^2 = 225  so 16^2 = (15+1)^2= 15^2 +2*15*1 +1^2 = 225+30+1=256  17^2 = (15+2)^2 = 15^2 + 2*2*15 +2^2 = 225+60+4=289  20^2= 400 and 25^2 = 625 so let us try  23^2 = (20+3)^2 = 20^2 +2*3*20 +3^2 =400+120+9=529      If working with whole numbers does not get you close enough then continue this approach with fractions.

Also the bigger the animal the more harmful the effect.    ketchup- again depends on whether it is organic or not. Though I assume tomatoes to be slightly different    Bread- this would have the least effects but grain used to make the flour needs to be haversted. Water & yeast are added.     Meat: reformed beef.

How can you write two equations for this?    Since you have 160 now and you get 7 a week, you can say 160 + 7x where x= number of weeks.      The equation for the your friend part is create similarilily: 210 + 5x     Now set the equations equal to each other and solve for x which is the number of weeks.    160 + 7x = 210 + 5x  Write equation.  160 + 7x - 5x = 210 + 5x - 5x  Move x's to one side.  160 - 160 + 2x = 210 - 160  Isolate your variable.  2x = 50 Simplified.   2x/2 = 50/2 Divide by your coefficient of x.  x = 25  It would take 25 weeks.

Your friend has $210 - $160 = $50 more than you have.    Each week you earn $7 - $5 = $2 more than he does.    So it will take you $50 / ($2 per week) = 25 weeks to "make up the difference" between his total and your total.|`|9sf8mnP3aa	x represents the number of weeks worked  160 + 7x represents you  210 + 5x represents your friend    since you want the same amount of money, set them equal to each other and solve the equation.    160 + 7x =210 + 5x    bring the x's to one side. I will bring them to the left, so I will subtract 5x from both sides    160 + 7x - 5x = 210 + 5x - 5x            result:  160 + 2x = 210    now, subtract 160 to take it to the right side  160 - 160+ 2x = 210 - 160    result:  2x = 50    divide both sides by 2  result x = 25    It will take 25 weeks for you to have the same amount of money    I hope this helps.

xz4Cf3xfaa	I have answered this question so many times and the reason that I do is that I am disgusted with skeptics and their cynicism and feel compelled to lend support to the other more intelligent contributors.    One reason, there is a good possibility is that there are those who may believe the moon landings were real, but intentionally try to persuade people otherwise for some sort of attention, fame or profit. These people I believe are especially loathsome.   The thing I find most bothersome about the hoax advocates is their repeated failure to apply the scientific method, that is, the principles of discovery and demonstration considered necessary for scientific investigation, generally involving the observation of phenomena, the formulation of a hypothesis concerning the phenomena, experimentation to demonstrate the truth or falseness of the hypothesis, and a conclusion that validates or modifies the hypothesis. The hoax advocates routinely observe a phenomenon; they usually call it an anomaly, dream up one possible explanation for the anomaly, and then jump straight to the conclusion that their explanation is the correct one. They universally fail to put their claims through the rigorous testing necessary to validate them. It is this failing that irreparably damages the credibility of the hoax advocates    If one looks at the hoax "theory" in total, it becomes apparent it is little more than a fairy tale based on a handful of mistaken observations and assumptions. You may see a hundred examples of so-called hoax evidence, but it is mostly just repeated samples of the same misinterpreted phenomena.    Of course, the hardest part of the theory to buy is that NASA, an organization of thousands of people in a position to know, and its contractors, were all paid off, or threatened into never talking about how the lunar landings were staged. If NASA could actually pull that off, it would be a greater achievement than landing people on the moon. This would be one of the biggest stories of the century, but we're asked to believe that in a government that leaks to the press like a shot gunned sieve, not only is no one talking, but also that all of the astronauts are lying as well. None of them will break ranks.|`|YdGsp59kaa	Yes, the Apollo missions really happened.  All the relevant qualified experts accept the evidence as genuine.

Don't be fooled.|`|qDYzdz5daa	The someone who said this to you?    Never listen to them again.  Whoever they are, they're an idiot.    Every claim ever made by the "we didn't land on the moon" theorists has been examined and debunked over and over again, to the point where their "theories" can now be accurately described as "lies," because even THEY know that they're not true. Now they're just trying to sell books and make crappy Youtube videos.    This year, we will launch the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter with enough sensitivity that it will be able to take pictures of the landers on the surface of the moon.    At that time, I would like to encourage all those of us who already know that the Moon landings were real, to pick a denier from this list, go to their house, and ram a broomhandle up their butt.

Just one example:   Hoaxers claim that the flag was waving in some wind  Now everyone who bothers to do some research (instead of relying on the fraudulent Snippets the Hoaxers show) will find out, that the flag was held up by a wire, and appeared only to be waving while (and shortly after) being handled by one of the astronauts.   You also have to ask yourself if it is really believeable that NASA would miss a waving flag if they wanted to fake it?     Now certain  answerers may claim otherwise but if you read their stuff, and do some research (like reading previous threads about this subject), you will notice that all their "evidence" has been debunked numerous times.  Do they acknowledge it? Are they even try to explain why the explantions given are incorrect? No, they just repeat the same bunch of lies over and over again. That should give you an idea about either the quality of their research or  their  honesty...|`|gWlmU1KJaa	Louis Armstrong was the first man on the moon, and sang the famous song "what a wonderful world" which was popular at the time    Unfortunately, he had trouble walking on the moon, as Sting, the famous singer had warned him his legs might break, possibly due to it being made of cream cheese.|`|nuhi9H6paa	One reason, there is a good possibility is that there are those who may believe the moon landings were real, but intentionally try to persuade people otherwise for some sort of attention, fame or profit.

If you use the "e" rate (where e is Euler's number), k is a constant that changes with each problem.  See below to find the relationship between k and the half-life.    Half life is the time a radioactive substance requires to decay to half its original mass.    For your problem,   A0 = 100.  h=5700    So your equation would be  A(t)=100*(1/2)^(t/5700)    After 100 years you would have    A(100) = 100*(1/2)^(100/5700) grams.        To get the constant k from the half-life,    k=ln(0.5)/half-life    For C-14, this is  k=ln(0.5)/5700 = -0.0001216    So you could also use    A(t)=A0*e^(-0.0001215*t)      Hope that helps.|`|PImmA8CJaa	Hahaha.

AA11474133	Since you mention graph, that's one way to look at it.  (The other would be trig formulas I don't remember any more.)  I'll assume the cosT is a typo and you mean cos(x-theta/4).    Graph sin x and cos x and you'll see sin shifted 90 degrees gives you cos.  The problem is shifting sin by theta and cos by theta/4, and these need to differ by 90 degrees (or pi/2).  That will give you an equation to solve for theta.  Just pay attention to the signs, since the two are shifted in opposite directions.  Put your answer in here and I'll tell you if it is right.

GASTNilgaa	One approach would be to take     p(x) = Ax^7 + Bx^6 + Cx^5 + ... + Gx + H    and use the fact that p(0) = 0, p(2) =23, p(3) = 38, p(4) = 55, etc. to set up a system of 8 equations in the 8 unknowns A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.      For example p(0) = 0 tells us (by plugging in x=0 to the formula for p)     H = 0.    The equation p(2) = 23 tells us that (taking x = 2 everywhere in the formula for p(x) and using the fact that x^7 = 128, x^6 = 64, etc) that    128A + 64B + 32C + 16D + 8E + 4F + 2G + H = 23.    If you do this for each point you're given, you'll get 8 linear equations in the 8 unknowns.  This is solvable "by hand" if you have a lot of time on your hands; it is a better job for a computer.  If you insisted on doing it by hand, the technique of "Gaussian elimination" is probably the best.  You would learn more about solving large systems of linear equations in a "linear algebra" class.  Most high schools do not teach linear algebra, but if you can find a junior college or university, the odds are they will have a class on it.  An equivalent approach to this problem is through the calculation of "Lagrange polynomials," but it is the same amount of work.)    If the number of points were smaller--- for example, if you wanted to find a line going through two given points, or a cubic going through three given points, the same approach would work, but you'd have only two or three equations in two or three unknowns--- something much easier to solve.    In any case, if you do solve it you get    p(x) = (17/8064) x^7 - (353/5760) x^6 + (4117/5760) x^5 - (4903/1152) x^4 + (977/72) x^3 - (29873/1440) x^2 + (19447/840) x    Using techniques from linear algebra, one can prove that this is the _only_ solution: there is no other 7th degree polynomial that will work.  (So no matter _what_ method you use to approach the problem, the answer is going to be that ugly.  There will be no 'simple' method that produces a simpler result.)    Note that the input data is relatively "simple" (just nice, round whole numbers) but the output data is so "ugly" (fractions with huge numerators and denominators).  In general this cannot be avoided in fitting Nth degree polynomials to sets of N points.      For this reason, and others, in the "real world" people generally use other methods of approximating a given set of points.  For example, it is often preferable to use piecewise-defined functions using large numbers of polynomials of low degree as the pieces, than it is to approximate using a single high degree polynomial.  (See "splines" on Wikipedia for more.)

5dVyWqdsaa	This is a ratio question. Simply put, the proportion you invest is the same proportion of the profits you should get.    i.e. If you invest $4000 out of $10 000 (4000+3500+2500) which is the same as 4/10, then you should get 4/10 of $2700.    4/9 x 2700 is the same as 2700 divided by 10 and then multipled by 4.   i.e. 2700/10 = 270, 270 x 4 = $1080.    This follows exactly the same for the other two amounts.    3500/10000 x 2700 = $945  2500/10000 x 2700 = $675.    To check that your answer is correct, add together your three amounts (1080 + 945 + 675 = 2700). If it matches your original profits, your answer is generally right!|`|LaJBdBlbaa	2700 / 3 = 900     2700 - 900 = 1800       1800|`|NFEKbYKjaa	Well I'll try to make it easy to follow.  The way I would go about this problem is to just figure the percentage each X, Y, and Z have invested compared to the total investment.    X / X+Y+Z | 4000 / 4000+3500+2500 = .40  Y/X+Y+Z | 3500 / 4000+3500+2500 = .35  Z/X+Y+Z | 2500 / 4000+3500+2500 = .25    Now the problem with the question here is that X invested the most amount of money $$$.....so he will be receiving the MOST (40%) of the profits....so he won't be receiving less than anyone.  But to figure out let's say how much less Z will receive than X....    X - Z = .40 - .25 = .15 [Z receives 15% less than X]  15% of 2700  = $405 Less than X|`|Y3iV2Ljkaa	I don't know if this is correct, but if you add 4000, 3500, and 2500, then you get 9000. Since x invested 4/9 of the profit, then you divide 2700 by 9 and get 300, then multiply by 4 and get 1200. Then subtract 4000 by 1200 and get 2800.

Asteroids and comets both orbit in this belt.   The average asteroid is a "rubble pile" consisting of large rocky pieces covered in dust.   Comets are basically dirty snowballs.

So to find the relationship between rectangle  1 and  2:    W/w = 10/4 = 2.5    So, the big rectangle is 2.5 time s the size of the small one. This is how we find the length of the big rectangle:    L = l * 2.5 = 6 * 2.5 = 15    So the area of the big rectangle is L * W:    Area = L * W = 15 * 10 = 150  Area = 150cm^2

And you know the volume is 80 cm.    If you fill in the equation with this information you know that the only thing left to figure out is the Length of the cuboid.    so V = L x W x H   80 cm= L x 4cm x 4 cm     80 cm = L x 16 cm    Therefore you need to divide 80 by 16 to find out the Length.

The alephs are numbers, not sets.|`|RxukJqL5aa	If a set is countable, that means that it will be able to be put in bijection with the set of natural numbers.  However, if this is the case, then the cardinality is aleph_0.    Simply by its definition, any set with cardinality aleph_2 cannot be countable, just because aleph_0 and aleph_2 are different.  (if you need a proof of this, then you'd need to tell me what you know - needless to say, it follows by definition if you a little bit of background to make the definition sound)|`|VUdaZUpwaa	Hi,     Aleph-0 is the infinity of natural numbers.  There are various proofs that the set of natural numbers is countable.  Aleph1 can be thought of as the the number of  points on a line or surface and is larger than the infinity of natural numbers, and is not countable.  Aleph2 can be thought of as the number of different curves that can be drawn on a surface.  That number is larger than Aleph1, and so, it not countable.       There are various mathematical proofs relating to these ideas, but this word processor does not lend itself to the sort of mathematical symbols needed for the proofs.

The hypotenuse of that triangle is equal to the radius.  You know the triangle has a hypotenuse of 20 and a leg of 16. Notice the ratio of these two sides is: 5;4 as in a 3:4:5 right triangle.  You do not have to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the third side.  I will leave it to you to finish the problem.

A geosynchronous satellite is one  that has orbital period equal to one siderial day. A geosynchronous satellite does not need to have circular orbit nor does it need to remain in equatorial plane.    Naturally it's better to have a satellite at the same point in the sky and at the same distance, but there are very few positions available for such satellites, only 120 positions separated by 3 degrees.

IUmAflSqaa	When the characteristic of F is not 2, it's enough to show that not every element is a square.  (When the characteristic is 2, every element is a square, so we've got to try something else.)  The multiplicative group F* is always cyclic, and if F has odd characteristic, then F has an odd number of elements, so F* has even order.  So if F* = , then g^(2k+1) doesn't have a square root in F for any integer k, and so x^2-g^(2k+1) is irreducible.    If F has characteristic 2, we have to be a little more careful.  Consider the map:    F -> F, x |-> x^2+x    This is a homomorphism of additive groups.  Indeed, we have for all x, y in F:    (x+y)^2+x+y = x^2+2xy+y^2+x+y = (x^2+x)+(y^2+y)    Now the kernel of this homomorphism is nontrivial, since 1^2+1 = 0.  Thus there must exist some element g of F such that g is not in the image of the homomorphism, i.e. so that x^2+x-g = x^2+x+g doesn't have a solution in F.  So this must be irreducible.

D5ShDa5naa	You'll need to use the chain rule, the product rule, and the fact that f ' of e^(anything) is e^(that thing).    The -6 is a constant, so it'll stay where it is. After it comes e^something, so e^something will be part of the derivative too. Let's call that something y, so y = xsin(x).    f ' (x) = -6e^y    Except y is a function of x, so you need the chain rule to finish the derivative. If you have e^y and y = xsin(x), the complete derivative will be the derivative of e^y *times* the derivative of the function y with respect to x. (You have to do this whenever you have an exponent that's a function.)    So: f ' (x) = -6 * the derivative of e^y  Which is -6 * e^[xsin(x)] * the derivative of xsin(x)    To take the derivative of xsin(x) you'll need the product rule, which says that the derivative of any f(x)*g(x) is equal to f ' (x)*g(x) + f(x)*g ' (x).

921fd3e5c127d3dd26ff9bd25b494b9aaa	Without getting technical, since you understand the concept, degrees of freedom are used in agricultural statistics. You might want to determine which variety of soybeans will give you the best yield. If you plant half of a field in variety A and the other half in variety B and var A makes 50 bu/a and var B makes 43 bu/a, you might conclude that var A was the best one to use. You may be right, but it might be that var A was just planted in the best part of the field. This is called experimental error.  Statistics is a way to eliminate as much experimental error as possible. The more degrees of freedom that you have the more error that you can eliminate. So if you want a good test, you test more varieties than two. Say you plant twenty, to get 19 degrees of freedom. To eliminate more error you plant more plots of each variety and randomly select where each plot goes. The more replications you have, the more degrees of freedom and the more error you eliminate. You can never eliminate all of the error and you have to limit the number of varieties and replications or your experiment quickly gets to big to handle. You have to compromise and hit a medium that you can work with and still give you an experiment that you can eliminate enough experimental error in so that you have confidence that the difference that you see in the varieties are real and not just due to chance..|`|gCn6bXAFaa	Degrees of freedom for treatments is defined as t-1. t=number of treatments.    Degrees of freedom for error is defined as n-t. n=number of overall trials (treatments multiplied by replicates)    Degrees of freedom-Total is defined as n-1.   So four treatments each with 5 replicates, 4x5=20  total response variables,   df(treatments) t-1= 5-1=4= df  df(error) n-t=20-5=15  df(total) n-1=20-1=19    USE OF CONCEPT IN AG. EXP:    Degrees of freedom are used in statistical testing.  Statistics were developed to help understand the difference between the effects of a treatment and random variation.    say you give people a super-vitamin that could make them taller.  you measure these people are they *are* taller than average.  BUT did the vitamin work or is this just a taller than average group?  Stats and degrees of freedom help you differintiate between random variation and real differences.  It's necessary for any experiments Ag. or otherwise.|`|2ozl4K3Oaa	Tricky Question ???|`|kDxljPUnaa	Degrees of freedom??

AA10927246	We can prove it by contradiction.  Let's assume that the number 3 is *rational*.    A number that is rational may be written as the ratio of two integers.  In addition, there is a unique reduced form for that fraction.  Let a and b be two integers whose ratio is 3 and let the fraction a/b be in lowest terms (reduced):    3 = a/b    Square both sides:    3 = a2 / b2    3b2 = a2    If b is odd, then b2 is odd; in this case, a2 and a are also odd.  Similarly, if b is even, then b2, a2, and a are even. Since any choice of even values of a and b leads to a ratio a/b that can be reduced by canceling a common factor of 2, we must assume that a and b are odd, and that the ratio a/b is already reduced to smallest possible terms. With a and b both odd, we may write     a = 2m + 1  b = 2n +1   Where m and n are integers.    Substitute back into 3b2 = a2:    3(2n + 1)2 = (2m + 1)2  3(4n2 + 4n + 1) = (4m2 + 4m + 1)  12n2 + 12n + 3 = 4m2 + 4m + 1  12n2 + 12n + 2= 4m2 + 4m    Divide by 2:  6n2 + 6n + 1= 2m2 + 2m    Factor out the common 2s:  2(3n2 + 3n) + 1 = 2(m2 + m)    Since n and m are integers, we have an odd number on the left and an even number on the right.    However we have now reached a contradiction which means our original assumption about 3 being rational has to be wrong.    Proof by contradiction:  3 is *irrational*|`|913fb8ceffd6a8e7aea30ec81720fd2eaa	First we'll assume that (3) is not irrational (that is, that it's rational), and show that we get a contradiction.  This would prove the irrationality of (3).    Since we assumed (3) is rational, we must be able to write it as (3) = a / b, where a and b are integers and p and q are in lowest terms.  If you square both sides of this equation, you get    3 = (a^2)/(b^2)    so that a and b are integers and are in lowest terms. So,    3(b^2) = a^2    So a^2 is divisible by 3, since it equals 3(b^2). That means that a must be divisible by 3 as well. Thus a^2 is divisible by 9.    But we can also write    b^2 = (a^2)/3    Since a^2 was divisible by 9, (a^2)/3 must be divisible by 3.    We have just shown that a and b are both divisible by 3.  This means they couldn't have been in lowest terms.  We assumed they were in lowest terms, which means we have a contradiction.  Thus (3) is irrational.|`|IqLTUpfiaa	Using the Rational Root Theorem:  x= sqrt 3  x^2 =3  x^2 -3=0  The possible rational roots of this polynomial are the factors of the constant term: 1, -1, 3, -3  None of them are solutions to the equation, so the real solution sqrt 3 must be irrational.|`|2EN66jPMaa	assume root(3) is rational.  root(3) =a/b.  3=(aa/bb)  aa=3bb  so a is a multiple of 3.  so we can say a=3c  so aa=9cc  3bb=9cc  bb=(9cc)/(3bb)=3(cc/bb)  So b is a multiple of 3  but if root(3) equals a/b AND is rational,then the HCF of a&b should be 1.  so root(3) is irrational.|`|Hw5xFK0qaa	Theorem: ? 3 is irrational    Proof by contradiction...    Assume the theorem is false - it follows that 3 must be rational, and thus it is possible to find integers p and q such that    3 = p / q    and where p and q share no common factors (other than 1) - that is, p and q are relatively prime.  Squaring, we get    3 = p2 / q2    3q2 = p2    It is clearly that p2 is divisible by 3, and it follows that p must be divisible by 3.  So, we can let p = 3k:    3q2 = (3k)2    3q2 = 9k2    q2 = 3k2    But, this means that q2 is divisible by 3, and thus that q is divisible by 3.    This is a contradiction, as p and q cannot both be divisible by 3 as they must be relatively prime.    Thus, our assumption that the theorem is false must itself be false, and thus the theorem must be true.  Thus, 3 is irrational.

This happens alot on multiple choice tests which is why I often clarified my choices for the teacher.  So, "they all" could translate in to meaning that all together they brought six balls, or it could mean that they brought six balls each.  I think 6 and 24 are both correct answers based on plausible interpretations of the question.  The wording leans just a little more towards 6 all together, though.

AA11058044	There seem to be a lot of factors which influence the attractiveness of one person over another to mosquitoes.    All of those are listed already are some of the factors.    The amount of lactic acid in your sweat can also be a factor, as well as how much carbon dioxide you produce in your breath.  It's also possible that some people just have a body chemistry that's attractive to them - not much you can do about that.    Diet may have an influence.  There have been some who claim that high levels of potassium can have an influence, and those who eat a lot of fruit like bananas are more attractive - but the actual evidence for this is dubious.    Medications can also have a big effect.  I'm normally one of the lucky ones who isn't very attractive to mosquitoes, but when I was on anti-biotics for an abcessed tooth the mosquitoes came after me with a vengeance of Biblical proportions.    Even the colour of your clothes can be part of the equation.

The point equidistant from both of these intersects is the x coordinate of the centre of the circle, therefore :    p = 0    Then we can draw a line, from the centre of the circle (p,q) to either of the intersections (-7,0), and using the axes create a right-angled triangle (where the hypotenuse is 25, one of the other sides is 7, and the other is q)  Using basic pythagorus (q = sqrt ((25 * 25) - (7 * 7)))    q = 24.    the coordinates of the intersections can be found to be (0, q + 25) and (0, q - 25).

(p,q) = (0,24)    and thus the points of the circle meeting on y axis are (0,49) & (0,-1)
NSQaDOhYaa	Performance of laser systems is usually assessed by measuring the characteristics of the output beams rather than calculations based on system design and electrical or optical power inputs. The problem with lasers is that the influence factors are very variable - beam power may vary from microwatts to megawatts, the output may be cw or pulsed, and virtually everything changes with wavelength (you don't say whether the output is in the near ir or frequency doubled to 532 nm, by the way).    Nd Yag lasers are relatively high power devices which gives the option of using either solid state detectors, with some beam attenuation to bring the power level down to the working range of the instrument, or blackbody type absorption calorimeters, which have the advantage of integrating the energy levels in pulsed systems (if this is required). However, there are other measurements which might be required - beam profile, for example - and we really need more detail on the system and what needs to be achieved.|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	Would you like to translate your question into English?|`|fBti22TAaa	I guess you'd need to use some sort of calorimeter - one that will convert all of the optical energy into thermal energy, which warms up some water.

hHVMrnK3aa	My immediate answer would be 4 4 4.  Sum of squares is 16 + 16 + 16 = 48.    Consider (4-x) , 4, (4+x)  Then, the squares are (4-x)^2 + 16 + (4+x)^2  16 - 8x + x^2 + 16 + 16 + 8x + x^2  Total = 48 + 2x^2    x^2 > 0 for all x>0, so this will be greater than 48 for all x>0.    So if one of the numbers is 4, then the answer is 4, 4, 4.    That leaves cases where none of the numbers is 4.    The sqrt(48) = 6.93 none of the numbers can equal or exceed that,  because then that number alone makes the sum of squares exceed 48.    We can try some examples to get a feel for it:  6, 3, 3:  36 + 9 + 9 = 54  5.5, 3.5, 3: 30.25 + 12.25 + 9 = 51.5  5, 4.5, 2.5: 25 + 20.25 + 6.25 = 51.5  4.3, 4.3, 3.4: 18.49 + 18.49 + 11.56 = 48.54    I'm convinced it's 4, 4, 4, but this is not a rigorous proof.  I hope it is of some help.

e28KtQTqaa	It doesn't have rational factors, if that's what you meant.    You can use the quadratic formula to find irrational factors, or you can use the following procedure.    Suppose you have a quadratic:    ax2 + bx + c    The first step is to make it monic (that is, make a leading coefficient of 1) by substituting ax = y, or x=y/a.  Then the quadratic is equal to:    a(y/a)2 + b(y/a) + c  = y2/a + by/a + c  = (y2 + by + ca)/a    Remove the linear term by performing the substitution z = y + b/2, or y = z - b/2, so we have:    ((z - b/2)2 + b(z - b/2) + ca)/a  = (z2 - bz + b2/4 + bz - b2/2 + ac)/a  = (z2 - (b2/4 - ac))/a    You can then use the difference-of-squares factorisation:    u2 - v2 = (u-v)(u+v)    to factorise the first part.    (z - (b2/4 - ac))(z + (b2/4 - ac))/a    Then substitute z = ax + b/2 to find:    ax2 + bx + c  = (ax + b/2 - (b2/4 - ac))(ax + b/2 + (b2/4 - ac))/a    In this case, we have:    3x2 + 5x + -25  = (3x + 5/2 - (25/4 +75))(3x + 5/2 + (25/4 + 75))/3  = (3x + 5/2 - 513/2)(3x + 5/2 + 513/2)/3    You can then clean this up as you see fit.

hXwhTvO7aa	The key idea is that,  (p^2a+p^(2a-1)+...+p+1) divides (p^4a+p^(4a-2)+...+p^4+p^2+1)  for each prime power p^a in the decomposition of n.  This is  evident if you sum each series to get,    (p^(2a+1)-1)/(p-1)  and  (p^(4a+2)-1)/(p^2-1).  Multiplying these  respective factors together for each prime power in n we get the  result: If n is a perfect square then the sum of the divisors of n  divides the sum of the squares of the divisors of n.
vvYQUbkYaa	normally in a 2-step equation, you do addition/subtraction first and then multiplication/division. you do do -2 first in this case, so subtract 2 from each side and get x/9=-9. this might be where you went wrong - you subtracted 2 from the left side, and added 2 to the right. so with x/9=-9, multiply both sides by 9 and get x=-81.
r5CttpsFaa	for the first one, you can divide out a common e^(5x), which leaves you with e^(x)/(e^(2x)+1), make the substitution u=e^x, so du=e^xdx. this gives you du/(u^2+1), which when integrated gives arctan(u). back substitute to get arctan(e^x).    for the second one, you're going to do something similar. again, divide out a common e^(5x). this leaves you with e^(2x)/(e^(2x)+1). now make the substitution u=e^(2x), so du=2e^(2x). this gives you 1/2*(1/(u+1)). integrate this to get 1/2*ln(u+1). back substitute to give you 1/2*ln(e^(2x)+1)

Pretty cool stuff.|`|AA10179972	 sec2 x tan x dx    u = sec x  du = sec x tan x dx     (sec x)(sec x tan x dx) =  u du = 1/2 u2 + C = 1/2 sec2 x + C    u = tan x  du = sec2 x dx     (tan x)(sec2 x dx) =  u du = 1/2 u2 + C = 1/2 tan2 x + C    To prove that both results are correct, you need to show that there exists some constant that, when added to 1/2 sec2 x, gives you 1/2 tan2 x.    1/2 sec2 x + C = 1/2 tan2 x    Multiply through by 2:    sec2 x + 2C = tan2 x    Recall the trig identity 1 + sec2 x = tan2 x.    So if 2C = 1, C = 1/2, and:    1/2 sec2 x + 1/2 = 1/2 tan2 x    Therefore both solutions are correct, because from each solution, you can get the other solution by adding or subtracting a constant (1/2).|`|AA11508270	u = tan(x)  du = sec2x dx    Your integral becomes:    u du = (u2)/2 + C = (tan2x)/2 + C    u = sec(x)  du = sec(x)tan(x) dx    Note:sec2xtanx = sec(x)(sec(x)tan(x))    Your integral becomes:    u du = (u2)/2 + C = (sec2x)/2 + D     sin2x + cos2x = 1    Divide by the whole equation by 2cos2x to get:    (sin2x/2cos2x) + cos2x/2cos2x = 1/2cos2x    (1/2)(tan2x) + 1/2 = (1/2)sec2x    I know you might say that this is not equivalent, but if we take the derivative of both sides, then the term 1/2 drops out since it's a constant and you get:     (1/2)(tan2x)' = (1/2)(sec2x)', and this proves the point that both antiderivative are equivalent.
kz7KCpthaa	The integrand of this function seems to match one of the integrals of inverse trigonometric functions.  Since the derivative of the arcsecx = du / u * squareRootOf(u^2 - a^2), then the arcsecx must be the anti-derivative of the representative integrand.  Thus, S x / (x^2 - 1)(squareRootOf(x^4 - 2x^2)dx => S du / u * squareRootOf(u^2 - a^2) = S x dx / (x^2 - 1) * (sqrt((x^2 - 1)^2 - (1)^2, where u = x^2 - 1 && a = 1.  By re-evaluating this integrand, you have a factored constant of 1/2 integral of x dx / (x^2 - 1)(sqrt(x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 - 1)), which yields an integral of S f(x) dx = S x dx / (x^2 - 1)(sqrt(x^2 - 2)^2 - (1)^2) =       1/2 * arcsec|x^2 - 1| + C.

That is, the probability of selecting two people who both have type A blood would be:    (0.4)(0.4) = 0.16    The probability of selecting two people who both have type B blood would be:    (0.2)(0.2) = 0.04    The probability of selecting two people who both have type o blood would be:    (0.3)(0.3) = 0.09    The probability of selecting two people who both have type AB blood would be:    (0.1)(0.1) = 0.01    (0.4)(0.4) + (0.2)(0.2) + (0.3)(0.3) + (0.1)(0.1) = 0.16 + 0.04 + 0.09 + 0.01 = 0.3, or 30% chance they'll have the same blood type.    b)    If you pick two people who have different blood types, then you're NOT picking any two people who have the same blood type.    So this is the "inverse" of question a, and you can subtract the answer from a from 1:    1 - 0.3 = 0.7, or 70% chance they'll have different blood types.
5RupXCn6aa	The quadratic formula is used on quadratic equations of the form:    ax^2 + bx + c = 0    Just like your example.  The first step is always to get your equations into this form.

KUVRekuZaa	Put simply:  We can measure the size of the Earth, and some clever astronomical calculations can give a good figure for the mass of the Earth, so we can know by a further simple calculation the average density of the Earth  The overall density of the earth is much greater than the density of crustal rocks, and denser even than the rocks we belive ( from rocks that have reached the surface from deep within the Earth) are in the mantle (or at least, teh upper mantle).    So, something very dense must be deep mwithin the Earth to account for the extra mass to make the density right.    Other, seismic observations also support the idea of a very dense core beneath a liquid mantle.
hRMjxFUFaa	To solve for h, simply isolate h on one side by taking everything else to the other.    To get rid of the 1/2 on the right side, you need to multiply by 2 ON BOTH SIDES (what you do on one side MUST be done to the other). The equation then looks like this:    A = (1/2)h(b1+b2)  (2)A = (2)(1/2)h(b1+b2)  2A = h(b1+b2)    In this case, treat (b1 + b2) as a single quantity, and divide both sides of the equation by that to take it to the other side:    2A = h(b1+b2)        2A        =  h(b1+b2)  ------------       --------------  (b1+b2)          (b1+b2)    You have now isolated h and have solved for it.    h = 2A/(b1+b2)     ;)|`|bTHhpGanaa	h = 2A/(b1+b2)|`|DtGwZauDaa	this is a simple transformation of equation problem.    you have been asked to make h the subject    we do this by moving the terms away from the term we want alone, by dividing multiplying adding and subtracting the other terms as necessary..    our first move here is to move the (b1 + b2) away from the 1/2 h term.    the brackets around this term means that it is multiplied to the first 1/2h term.  to move a multiplied term we have to divide by that term.    So we must divide both sides of the equation by ((b1 + b2). {both sides refers to both sides of the  = sign.}    this gives us    A/(b1 +b2) = [1/2h(b1+ b2)] / (b1 + b2)]    this cancels out the (b1 + b2) on the right side to leave    A/(b1 +b2) = 1/2h    If you can not see this move  i will just simplify before going on.    lets make  1/2h = 3, and (b1 +b2) = 4. by substituting the plain numbers 3 and 4 in we had ( 3 x 4) / 4 which leaves us 3 as the 4's cancel - hope that helps.    Now back to the remaining bits    A/(b1 +b2) = 1/2h    as we have 1/2h on the right side, we need get rid of the 1/2. we do this by multipling both sides by 2 [ 1/2 x 2 = 1]    this leaves us     [A/(b1 +b2) ] x 2 = h    job done|`|jb0sQBY0aa	h = 2A / (b1 + b2)

Compare that mass to the given gram-molecular mass.  If they are equal, then the empirical formula is also the molecular formula.  However, if the molecular mass is larger than the formula mass of the empirical formula, divide the given molecular mass by the calculated empirical formula mass.  Then, multiply the subscripts of all the atoms of the empirical formula by that number.    4a    empirical formula = CH2  empirical formula mass = 14.027  molecular mass given = 112.24  112.24 / 14.027 = 8  molecular formula = CH2 x 8 = C8H16    4b    empirical formula = NO2  empirical formula mass = 46.005  molecular mass given = 92.02  92.02 / 46.005 = 2  molecular formula = NO2 x 2 = N2O4    4c    empirical formula = CH  empirical formula mass = 13.019  molecular mass given = 78.11  78.11 / 13.019 = 6  molecular formula = CH x 6 = C6H6     4d    empirical formula = CHCl  empirical formula mass = 48.472  molecular mass given = 96.94  96.94 / 48.472 = 2  molecular formula = CHCl x 2 = C2H2Cl2

PAlP6j7faa	OK my precal teacher gave me this thing to help us remember which trig functions are positive. A(ll) S(tudents) T(ake) C(alculus). Where 'A' is all trig functions are positive in Q1 and thus all > 0. 'S' stands for sine and cosecant ( which are positive in QII and thus > 0) while all the others are negative thus   Hope this helped!!

The St. Lawrence Seaway is the common name for a system of canals that permits ocean-going vessels to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the North American Great Lakes, as far as Lake Superior.  Duluth, MN on Lake Superior.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	They travel up through the St. Lawrence Seaway and into Lake Ontario. From there they go into Lake Erie and then into Lake Huron and finally into Lake Superior where they make their way acorss the lake to Duluth.|`|DtGwZauDaa	Connection to ocean and open water  The Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway opened the Great Lakes to ocean-going vessels. The move to wider ocean-going container ships  which do not fit through the locks on these routes  has limited shipping on the lakes. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping. Some icebreakers ply the lakes.    The Great Lakes are also connected to the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Illinois River (from Chicago), to the Mississippi, to the Gulf. An alternate track is via the Illinois River (from Chicago), to the Mississippi, to the Ohio, up the Ohio, and then through the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (combination of a series of rivers and lakes and canals), to Mobile Bay and the Gulf. Commercial tug-and-barge traffic on these waterways is heavy.    Pleasure boats can also enter or exit the Great Lakes by way of the Erie Canal and Hudson River in New York. The Erie Canal connects to the Great Lakes at the east end of Lake Erie (at Buffalo, NY) and at the south side of Lake Ontario (at Oswego, NY).|`|xSGPRRSvaa	Rivers, I guess I dont know i thought that was impossible

dGN8YoEQaa	There are a number of limbless vertebrates (salamanders, caecillians, limbless lizards (which are not the same as snakes), and of course snakes. All of them either are adapted to burrowing underground, or swimming. And many of them have atrophied (almost useless) forelimbs and even vestigial rear-limbs.    So the way natural selection explains it is that once a species has found a niche in some environment (burrowing or swimming), and the legs either become useless or in-the-way for that environment, then in each successive generation, those individuals born with slightly smaller limbs them survive slightly better. Over time, this leads to complete atrophy of the limbs.|`|fKzoIPKiaa	maybe it outgrow the need for limbs idk
vvYQUbkYaa	the first one should be f(x)=x^2 (do you see why?)  with the others, look for the vertex of the function, it should either be the single lowest point or the single highest point. in  2, the f(x) coordinates decrease, and then when x reaches 0, the f(x) coordinates start to increase again. that lowest point is the vertex, (0,8).  now, there are two ways to write a quadratic function: f(x)=ax^2+bx+c (the most common), and f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k (where the vertex, or lowest point, of the quadratic has coordinates (h,k).). if you know the vertex, plug it into the 2nd equation (for  2, you get f(x)=a(x-0)^2+8). and then take another point that is given in the table (i'm going to use (1,11)), and plug it into that new equation (in this case to get 11=a(1-0)^2+8). and then solve for a, in this case a=3. so the equation for  2 is f(x)=3(x-0)^2+8, or f(x)=3x^2+8. if you want it in the form f(x)=ax^2+bx+c, then multiply it out (it is already in that form, but some of the others may not be). this should give you the equation for the quadratic represented in your grids.    hope this helped!

eUgwHzeqaa	In 10th grade, what you should be focusing on is just getting into college.  It is really early for you to be thinking about medical specialties at this point.  I don't think even first-years in med school should be too sure about what they want to do--there's so much to explore.  As far as courses in your junior and senior years are concerned, nothing is going to specifically help with neurology.  Take subjects you're interested in, and taking the most advanced physics, chemistry, biology and math classes you can will certainly help once you're in college and taking these things again at that level.    If you are really interested, maybe you can arrange to shadow a neurologist for a day, but truthfully, I think that deciding on a specialty before you're even in med school is kind of limiting yourself.  There are a lot of great choices out there--what if you get into your surgical rotation and realize that you like dealing with the anatomy more directly?    If your school has a pre-med club, join that.  Focus your attention on choosing a good college and keep your interests broad for now.      Good luck, and have fun!|`|9Xur3g9Paa	You need to take a pre-med curriculum in college which would include at least a year of chemistry, biology, calculus, etc.  I would suggest getting into the best college or university you can.  From the schools that accept you, ask what their acceptance rate is into medical school.  They should have those stats.  That should be part of your decision-making process.  Once you start college you should meet with an advisor who will tell you exactly what courses you need to get into medical school.  You must have excellent grades in those college courses.  After you finish college and start medical school, by your second year you should have a good range of clinical experience to focus on neurology or neurosurgery, etc.  After you complete medical school, you will need to do a residency in that specialty.  Study hard.  Get good grades.  Did I mention study hard and get good grades?  I went through a neuroscience training program.  The brain is really fascinating.  Good luck.|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	looks like you're on the right track so far. take as many math and science courses as you can handle, and see if your school offers courses for college credit. your school counselor should be able to help with that. when you get to college you'll probably major in pre-med, and expect to go four more years after you get your bachelor's degree...|`|QfTEYT3zaa	You'll need to study medicine to become a neurologist, so you should focus on getting good grades and getting into med school. It'll be hard work, and after you've got your medical degree, there'll be many more years of training before you can become a neurologist, but good luck!

QykYW3R7aa	It really depends on what they test for.  Midrin contains an ingredient that metabolizes into chloral hydrate, a really old sedative-hypnotic (replaced by barbiturates and then benzodiazepines)... so if they test for chloral hydrate (a schedule IV substance), then yes it will give a positive result.  The DEA recently put Midrin into schedule IV, so even though it really is only good for migraines and is virtually not addictive at all, still best not to get caught using it without a prescription as it will be treated like any other controlled substance.    It should not give a positive for opiates.|`|EN32vSsCaa	One of the active ingredients, Isometheptene Mucate, is a sympathomimetic amine, remotely similar to amphetamine.  It is possible that it is producing a false positive for amphetamine.  Tell them, don't ask, to do a confirmatory GCMS test.
