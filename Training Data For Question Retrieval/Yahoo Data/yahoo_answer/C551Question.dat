20090307113557AAC8KDE	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Should I see a doctor?	I have sprained or twisted my ankle many many times before, but my father usually laughs at me instead of bringing me to the doctor. Today I missed the last step on the stairs, falling directly on my ankle and completely bending it. I was able to limp to the car after, but then as I was driving home, I was crying because it hurt so much at rest.   When I was limping to my house, it hurt less again.   It still hurt ridiculously while I was laying down or sitting, but since I took some Ibuprofen a little while ago, I'm moving around, but when ever I put pressure on it, I feel small sharp pains instead of the throbbing I usually get with a sprain.   Is there a chance that this is broken, or the fact that I can move all my toes rule that out.   Should I see a doctor anyway?

20090307112147AATxeqV	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Medical advise please?	Yesterday I had uncontrollable vomiting, diarrhea stomach pains. I was admitted to the hospital where they did some tests. They said I had an elevated number of white blood cells. Also, the ultrasound I took was inconclusive to appendicitis's. I also took a CT scan of my lower abdomen. The doctors said that looked normal. They said I still have a small chance appendicitis, regardless of the test results. They discharged me from the hospital with diarrhea and vomiting medication. The pain in my lower abdomen has returned since the pain medication they gave me got out of my system. I am convinced that this is more than the stomach flue, like the doctors said. I had a flue shot this year, and this pain is like nothing I ever experienced before. Last night the pain, before the painkillers were given to me, was a 10 out of 10. This morning, maybe the pain is at a 7 out of 10. I am still in a lot of pain, and don't know what to do. I am thinking about going back to the hospital. What do you think I have?

20090307114428AA5HAvI	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Possibly appendicitis?	Okay so last weekend I had a pain around the bellybutton area, and it made me nauseous so I threw up..and the next 2 or 3 days I had the same pain and nauseousness but didn't throw up. And the pain always happened at the same time (10:20pm). After that it went away until the next Tuesday and I had the same pain and I threw up..then on Thursday night I had a different kind of pain. This time it was on the lower right side of my stomach, and it was a sort of stabbing kind of pain. I told my stepmom about it becuase it REALLY hurt, and she told me it sounded like appendicitis because she had it as a child and had her appendix removed. I don't think it's appendicitis because I was tested for appendicits about 2-3 years ago. Could it be something else?

20090307124848AAYlSxK	Health;Men's Health	Aching penis does it mean anything?	Since last night, my penis started to ache every once in a while.  Then once i layed down for bed, it'd ache every 5-20 seconds.  It'd ache for like half a second, go away, and repeat again  5-20 seconds later...  Even this after-noon, it's still aching for like half a second every 20 seconds or so. and I havent masterbated in a few days or anything either, and even then, it'd only cause a "sore" feeling sometimes if i didnt use lube, never an aching feeling.      I just started Prozac 2 weeks ago, and I noticed I was having much more night erections since starting it.  Sometimes they'd stay there when I layed in bed, and I'd get up and walk around to make it go away.  But since I was sleeping, and just noticed it when I woke up, I have no idea if it was there for hours or just 20  mins or so.      Is this anything to be considered about? I'm just worried that at night when sleeping I may be having erections lasting a long time that don't know about. I cant call the doc since its saturday.. Only option would be urgent care, if warranted.  Last night I just set my alarm for every 3 1/2 hours to wake myself up, just to make sure that if I had an erection, I'd walk around to make it go away.   I only had one, once last night, though, and i walked around and it went away, yet it still aches today..

Hey      My Dad and I live in the same house, and he suffers from massive depression, which is strange because he was never like that.      Both my dad and I grew up the same way. During teenage years and through 20's we partied alot, we traveled, love life, and we are both very smart. We both believe in the incredible power the Brain has, and we understand how to stay away from stress and look at things in the best way possible, ect.....      but in the last year, my dad has become MORE and MORE depressed, more stressed out, almost to the point of having a breakdown      He knows better, he knwos he shouldnt be upset over little thngs, but he cant stop      My dad is a diabetic, now for 30 years, (type 1) and he is deteriorating, foot surgeries, bad eyes, the works... and now he is suffering from bad nausea everyday      He goes to a Pain Management Clinic for his pain, and he sees a Psyciatrist for his stress and depression      Tried all meds, from zoloft to xanax and everything inbetween         Now i know that his body getting worse, sickness and pain is part of the problem, but that is NOT why im asking      its not JUST his sickness, he wouldnt be THIS bad over just that. For some reason he cant do ANYTHING, my dad used to love music, video games, traveling, ect... but now, he wont even do any of it      he tries, and gives up after 5 minutes. nothing is fun to him, he can never enjoy himself, he gets close to having break-downs... i mean he can barely eat now, NEVER sleeps      and this is my basic question here      aside from the sickness.... aside from just "trying" to do stuff (because that is a stupid answer) ... and besides the normal depression/stress medicine      What is there? what can you do when everything else has failed???

20090225071650AAzv54l	Health;Mental Health	What do I do about my girlfriend's anxiety?	Ok here's the situation, this may get lengthy.    Me and this girl have been going out for 2 months, we're really enamored with one another. She has been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD and takes meds for it. She has also tried to quit smoking upon my request b/c I can't stand the stuff, and she also has wanted to quit for years as well so she's said I am a good reason for her to. We have had to address the smoking issue numerous times when I she slipped up. I was supportive and encouraging, told her I wouldn't leave her b/c it was hard for her to quit, and i never yelled or shouted in ANY of the situations.    Recently I was changing out the air freshener in her car and found a pack of smokes halfway gone; not 10 minutes prior to this she was singing her praises for how well she was doing. I confronted her about it and she initially lied about it, then owned up to it and said she didn't want to disappoint me.    Now i'm frustrated with the sneaking around, and the lying; so i cut the filters off. I used a regular kitchen cutting board and a chopping knife which was about 4.5 inches long. She flips out! I understand and admitted later on that what I did was immature. But she isn't mad, her anxiety has taken over and she is now convinced I am this terrible monster who's going to start hitting her when i get upset. We decided to take a break. We talked on the phone last week and she's still scared. I've been understanding, humbled myself, admitted my wrongs, but it seems none of this is getting through to her. She's been in abusive relationships before and i know this is probably contributing to her fears, but i have absolutely no idea what to do at this point. I feel completely helpless. What do you do when you are the source of your partner's anxiety?

20090227084313AAaSiO6	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Concussion four months later..could it be something else?	Well, basically four months ago I fell and hit my head on concrete. I went to my pediatrician, then a neurologist. They never did a CT or anything. they said if it was more than just a concussion, I would have different symptoms and they wouldn't treat it any differently.       I still have KILLER headaches, sleeping problems [put on trazadone to help me sleep], problems focusing and remembering[Ritalin for this one,] Fatigue, and extreme dizziness.      I have started physical therapy now, and it's not helping.      I passed out two weeks ago from being so dizzy.      I went to a different doctor yesterday, and he said i could be showing signs of diabetes? I looked it up, and I do drink a lot of water, I've lost seven pounds in one week[the Ritalin makes me not hungry, supposedly?] , and my mom has diabetes. Do you think I could have it as well, or is it just from the concussion?      Also, my neurologist tested me for hypothyroidism, he said it could explain while i'm always cold [even before the concussion], joint pain[wrist, thumb], forgetfulness[from concussion, or not?], restlessness, problems concentrating[from concussion, or not?], sensitivity to lights and sound [from concussion?], dizziness/headaches[concussion?], easy shortness of breath and chest tightness, ringing in the ears [concussion?], and vertigo[concussion?] ugh.       So basically..they're testing me for all this stuff and I need help.

I know a few people that have had it done and are smaller but it comes with a price.  Now that they are smaller they ***** about how much extra skin they have and then tell me that they already plan on having plastic surgery to have it removed.  One girl even lied and told everybody that she lost weight on her own with diet and excersice.  And the thing that really gets me is that insurance companies pay for the gastric bypass procedures.  What the?  Nobody is born fat.  They make themselves fat.  I know when I get to a point where I start not liking myself and know I'm gaining weight because my clothes don't fit me anymore.  I do something about it, like excercise and eat better and lose it on my own.  People fail to realize that it takes a long time to gain all that weight and less time to lose it.  Years to put it on and maybe a few months or a year of hard work to take it off.  Oh they wouldn't have extra nasty looking saggy skin because they'd be exercising and it would shrink on it's own and tone up.  Someone please tell me why people are so lazy.  Or whether or not you agree?  Thank you.

20090225014226AALKGgL	Health;Mental Health	Is this normal for me? Some advice please?	I wanted to know if these two things were normal.      1. I have bipolar disorder, I was diagnosed about a year ago. The thing is, its not normal I guess like in the colder months (mid-september to mid february) I usually suffer from a long depressive episode but there are a lot of manic symptoms in there. The rest of the months it starts off as very light mania and quickly get weird, like I am SUPER manic but still have an overall depressed feel. I get angry fast, I am jumpy, etc all the symptoms of mania mixed in with still feeling depressed just not as bad.      From my understanding its one or the other, either you suffer from a depressive episode or a manic, but mine are kinda both depending on the seasons.      Also      2. I have extreme loneliness throughout. I feel like my family has abandoned me mentally, I mean they are there and provide for me but not supportive at all. I have a lot of friends and a group of very close friends that would do anything for me, BUT they are not the most understanding people around, so any mention of mental problems and they get weird.      I feel like i really really really need a lover or something... I feel soooooo lonely and like I need someone... you know like a girlfriend, who I can share even just a little bit of my feelings and just have someone that is there for you in a sense which friends don't provide. I feel so lonely at times it hurts...      Is all of this normal? Do I feel even lonelier because I have bipolar disorder AND i dont have anybody that understands me or really really there for me, not just superficially?      I get even more depressed whenever I see couples enjoying each others company. I haven't had a girl friend in a long time because after I high school I started having just flings in college and then eventually my bipolar disorder got so bad I gave up...I am 22 btw.

20090227084733AAr1iPq	Health;Men's Health	Can I take legal action against a supervisor that says I stink?	Iv been working as a security guard. I work for a contracted security company who does security for a jet manufacturing plant. I had a water pipe break at my house so was unable to shower for one day. I did clean up with baby wipes before I came to work. When I got to work I went to my supervisor (she works for the plant, not my company) and explained what was going on. All was fine for a couple of weeks until the supervisor from the company that I work for approaches me and tells me that he got an email concerning my bo. He did say that he understood my pipes broke but he had to say something anyways. Now this was a little humiliating but its all ok, I don't think that I had an odor problem, but if I did I'd rather for someone to tell me. later on I was having a conversation with a non supervisor co worker. I asked her if she had ever noticed a bo on me. She stated that she didn't, but she did say that the plant supervisor(the one I originally told) had told her that I had an odor problem. This really irritated me that a supervisor would tell an employee about this type of problem but I blew it off. A few days later after that my supervisor(the one it works for my company) left his email up on my computer. I noticed my name in a subject box, so I felt that I had the right to read it. It was an email from the plant supervisor that was forwarded to my supervisor as well as another plane jane employee. I am embarrassed to even show my face at work now. I was wanting to pursue a career with the FBI, now I'm afraid to as they interview all of your previous co workers and supervisor to get a judge curator. I am a very clean person, I'm not denying the fact that I had bo. Weather if I did or not the problem was addressed and fixed. I do think that it is wrong for a supervisor to tell employees about this. Normally I would go and talk to the supervisor and ask her to keep hush hush but I can't due to it might jeopardize the contract. I did talk to my area manager and he said to let it be due to this fact. What can I do or what should I do??? This company has a rep of treating the contracted security like crap. Please help?

The reason, i would assume, would be because she is out at the bars at least once a week drinking a lott.   drinking has plenty of calories in it which is probably killing her weight loss attempts.   should i tell her this?   i don't know if she'd like, get offended? or not really care.   or maybe just be like YAH I KNOW. sort of thing?

One problem tho is that I'm still hungry, but if I eat anything else, my calorie total will keep increasing. Please help!! I really don't know what to do!!
20090227084818AAfN1Fv	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Is he too young for a hip replacement?	My husband has been diagnosed with congenital hip dislocation at the age of 27. The doctor told him that he would for sure need a hip replacement and to come back in when he was ready. My husband is in constant pain that requires him to be on a strong anti-inflammatory and he has to take several doses of pain medications a day just to make it through work etc. (My husband really does not want to take several doses of pain meds everyday for the next 5-10 years unless absolutely necessary) He decided to go ahead and get the surgery but the doctor said he did not expect to see him for another 5-10 years and said he did not recommend the surgery until then. He also said that hip replacements to not last all that long and you can't always get another one after the first. We were kind of surprised to hear this after doing some research on the internet. We found that individuals who got the surgery done in their late 20's and 30's were extremely happy. We also thought that the artificial hip would last much longer. We would like to hear from individuals who have experienced a similar situation. If you had the surgery at a young age what are your thoughts? If you opted to wait, what were your reasons? Thanks!

I've been through weight loss before, but it was through unhealthy means.       For about a year after I stopped losing weight by unhealthy means, I didn't know how to eat in a way that was good for me. I was eating McD's, lots of sugar, etc. Now I am eating a lot less calories, whole grain things, nothing with too much fat, etc.        I've been doing this for about a week and a half and haven't seem to lose anything yet. I'm used to losing a lb a day (I KNOW - Not healthy), but is this normal? I mean, it was a pretty dramatic change in diet.

20090307125122AAsnWxP	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do people really not have time for their health?	Mo matter what I'm doing I make sure to do at least 30 minutes cardio a day, and try to pack my own lunches, because I know damn sure any public place is going to have nothing but crap, aka, vending machines.      I know most people  say they don't exercise because they don't have time. But is this true? Don't people have time to wake up 30 minutes earlier and do something for their health, or even 30 minutes before bed? After all, something is better than nothing, and those 30 minutes could save you from gaining an extra 5 or 10 lbs overtime.      Why don't people make their dinners and meals the night before and quit stopping at McDonald's throwing their money and health away?      I just don't get it?

20090307133239AAVu4Vk	Health;Diet & Fitness	I eat so much but I never gain any weight????(I'm skinny)?	I'm 14 years old and I weight about 110-115 pounds. I'm always hungry for some reason, but when I eat, I barely gain any weight. It takes me at least a month to gain 5-10 pounds.When I DO gain some weight, the fat doesn't store in my stomach it goes down in my butt, thighs, and hips. I don't eat a lot of fast food but I'm crazy for candy and a bunch of junk food. It's like my stomach is always empty and I never get enough.      And when my stomach feels really empty, I tend to eat a lot of junk food and other foods because I wanna gain weight. But after I eat a lot, I'm worried about gaining TOO much weight. I dance/exercise about 20-30 minutes a day so I can keep up with my weight.       Any help with what I can do to stop eating so much but gaining appropriate weight at the same time? Will I become more fat if I eat too much even though my stomach feels empty?Should I exercise more? Any other info would be helpful :) Thanks

Lately during class I've taken out a piece of paper and written the alphabet with my left hand to practice, but the letters come out really messy.

I never consume more than 1000-1200, but I'm not starving myself at all! I eat regularly, and I eat healthy foods only (no/very little sweets). I don't feel like I'm depriving myself at all and I feel well.      I also work out everyday, not much, but burning about 125-200 calories with my intense cardio.

When I was 18 i used to weight 186 lbs-I was really obese for my height- but i was able to get down to about 133 lbs.  I've been working out for 5 months three times per week for about an hour and ten minutes using random methods i found in the internet.  I gained some weight but i haven't seen a remarkable improvement, and I believe that in five months I should have seen some change.  I don't really have much money to spend on equipment, which is why i really want a workout method that works.  I've been trying different methods i find throughout these past five months, and I really hate having to change my workout routine every three weeks because i don't see much progress if any.  I really want a workout that i know will work and that will give noticeable results.  All I have is a pull up bar.  I really want to gain muscle, look cut, and be toned by summer.  I really want an over all workout routine that will emphasize the chest (abs, obliques, pecs), arms (triceps, biceps, shoulders), legs (inner and outer thighs, hamstrings), and butt (lol but true).  I really want to see an improvement because i can't stand working so hard and not seeing any results.  PLEASE HELP!!!

20090307160108AAYKf74	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Heart palpitations that won't go away.?	I’m a 20 year old male with mild high blood pressure being successfully treated (last blood-pressure reading was 130/70) by Atenolol (50mg, 1x per day). I have no history of heart problems. About two years ago, I underwent Lap-Band surgery. Since that time I have lost 152 pounds so I don’t see how or why any serious problem would be coming up now. That said, here are the basics: In the summer of 2007, I had a number of pre-surgical tests including an EKG. Everything was fine. About a year and a half ago, I began using marijuana fairly regularly during the school semester (though on winter and summer breaks, my use was limited). Last Fall, I experienced a “freak-out” after using marijuana which led me to drive myself to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. After an EKG and a series of protein-tests over a six hour period, I was released with a diagnosis of dehydration (and a self-diagnosis of high, paranoid idiocy). That was in November of 2007. After that time, I figured my body (and my mind, apparently) was in need of a serious break from smoking. After about 2 weeks of sobriety, I began experiencing strong heart palpitations a night when I laid down. I could feel my heart beating throughout my entire body (though most notably in my legs and chest). Though not over 85 BPM, my heart rate was often higher than normal when I experienced the palpitations and for weeks I wouldn’t be able to sleep until 5 or 6 AM when my anxiety finally gave way to my exhaustion. I spoke to my doctor and he recommended I see the cardiologist who performed my pre-surgical cardiovascular examination. I did so and was given an EKG and a nuclear stress test. Both came back normal. I also had my cholesterol levels checked and those were normal.  A few weeks after the tests (and maybe a month after I quit) the palpitations stopped. In April I began smoking again, but not nearly as often as before and with extended breaks interspersed. Every time I stop, however, the palpitations come back, yet until now they have lasted no more than 2 to 3 weeks. Now that the extended history is out the way, here is my question: I am currently studying  abroad in Mexico. I have been here for 7 weeks now and since week three I have been experiencing off-and-on heart palpitations. In contrast to the norm, these are felt primarily in my chest and can be felt at various times throughout the day and in various positions. I was smoking prior to coming to Mexico but I haven’t touched the stuff since arriving (and, for the sake of staying out of a Mexican prison, I don’t plan to). In the past 2 years, I have had 3 EKGs, a nuclear stress-test and countless check-ups (where, for what it’s worth, the doctor always says “your heart sounds good”) is there anything to be worried about here?      All answers are welcome, but I would appreciate responses from those with medical-backgrounds. Thanks in advance.

I went to a male friend for help and ended up getting emotionally involved with him. I never kissed him or had sex or anything, I just became very needy and clingy with him because of my problems at home. My husband and I decided to work on the issues and we both stopped our bad behaviors.      Now, its like we have issues with truly forgiving each other. Whenever something new comes up, its like all the past hurts keep coming up along with it. Whenever I want to talk to him about my trust issues he reminds me that I went to another man.  He thinks the slate should be cleaned and neither one of us should talk about it anymore.        He lied to me so much and did many bad things like stealing from me and my daughter when he was using drugs. My wedding ring and even my Chihuahua went to a drug dealer. I was traumatized. I don't mean to justify my actions, but I was scared and heartbroken with what he did and I was only reacting. I was only using the other man in order to feel safe.  My life has never returned to normal.

Two weeks ago I went to the doctors with a bit of a sinus infection, he put me on antibiotics to clear it up. It seemed to work fairly well, however I woke up the other day with a scratchy throat and runny nose again. Then, last night, I found myself with a really bad headache and slight cough. When I woke up this morning I was having difficulty breathing (not in an allergic reaction type way, but kind of more along the lines of asthma..) I'm couching up quite a bit of mucous... is this worth making a trip to the hospital/medicentre? I'm not in my home town, so I can't make an appointment with my family physician.

Hi my name is Autumn....I was playing basketball with my nephew today and i think somehow i may have gotten poisen ivy in my eye. Heres the story:   Ayden(my nephew) missed the basket and it landed behind the hoop into this bush, i reached under the bush to get the ball out and rinsed the ball off cause it had mud on it and we started to play again. Later today my eye has been killing me, it feels like someone is rubbing it and making it irritated, if you know what i mean...So I went out to look at the bush and i found poisen ivy under it...lucky me!    Questions:   1.) DO you think this IS poisen ivy?   2.) Is it very dangerous if it gets in your eye?   3.) How does it go away if it's in your eye?....i know there is lotion but i don't think i can put lotion in my eye!      Thank you very much for your time and i will pick best answer later!

I don't even know who I am nor passionate about anything. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting along. Adding to that, I've never been in a relationship, which is fine with me..but I'm not even sure of my sexuality and would never want to kiss a guy. (I kissed a guy before...and just know that I wouldn't want to do it again. I could possibly see myself in a emotional relationship with a guy, but not a physical.   I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.   Adding to that, I've never really had close friends, and don't share my emotions with anyone. Part of me is like, what's the point, we're all just going to die? What's the point of any of this?      I know that I can't look to anyone else or anything to make me happy. I have to make myself happy...and I am trying to really get to know and love myself...but I just can't seem to get there..?

I do heavy lifting (20 sets per muscle) and cardio 4-5 days a week for 30 minutes. I have a pretty good diet plan and stay in my calorie range about 5 days a week. However, once it gets to the weekends I totally TRASH them eating whatever I want. I have found this has absolutely NO effect on my diet..if anything my body is improving. This is said to be unacceptable from fitness people everywhere..so how is this possible that it's not effecting me? It's driving me crazy that I can't explain this.      Thank you.

20090307163532AAHXTRY	Health;Men's Health	Is it tough to get a prescription for Viagra?	For some reason (stress/nerves?), I've been having a bit of a tough time performing lately. For some reason, my guy works fine when I'm with my girlfriend, but she suggested that the two of us and her roommate should have a night of fun together.      We've tried twice now, and I've not been able to get it up either time. The first time, it was getting hard, and then just went limp (right when they started playing with each other). The second time, it just wouldn't get up at all. Initially, I thought it was just a fluke or because I was drunk or something (it had never happened before), but twice seems like a pattern to me.      Would it be tough to get some Viagra (or Cialis, or whatever) from a GP? I'm currently at school, and don't have a regular physician out here. Would it be tougher to ask for (or, more accurately, to GET) this at an initial appointment?      They want to try again next weekend, and I'm already freaking out about it! I need help!

I had broken my tibia and fibula and needed surgery on my tibia.  I had an IM rod inserted into it with 4 screws to hold it in place.  I have noticed that my right foot no longer is set the way it used to be.  It is now about 30 degrees outward from where it originally was.  What I mean by this is , if you are standing and look at your feet, your feet forward are considered 0 degrees, but my right foot now points out to the right about 30 degrees if that makes more sense.  Should I be concerned about this new placement?  Is it common? Can this lead to damage down the line?  The right ankle does now crack/click when I move it as well but  i don't know if this is related to the injury or the foot placement or both/neither.

They were so hot that I could only have 4. I was up at 4 am puking my guts out. Would the hot wings be the cause of that, or do i have some sort of stomach virus?

When I get an erection, my penis can tilt all the way to the left with no problem, but when i do it to the right side it doesn't tilt as easily and it doesn't feel comfortable.

When I was a teenager penis sizes where around 3-4 inches around the age of 13-14. But to me it seems like many guys this age have at least 6 inches or even more. Could this be because of the evolution or is there something in the food or in the air? I ain't kidding, because its fact that puberty starts much earlier these days then lets say 30-40 years ago! Are there any explainations?

20090307161427AAiM3zk	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I was on vicoden for over year doc switched med to neurontin. vicoden worked better how do i get it back?	I was in a bad car wreck in March of 07. After the wreck the only thing wrong with me were a lot of scars and my foot was swollen for a month after. The pain in my foot finally went away about 2 months after. I had no problems with my foot until this past summer. I go to college, I came home to work over summer, and after I started working again my foot started hurting badly. I went to many doctors before I finally found one that made progress in helping my pain. my pain is a 5 or 6 out of 10 everyday that’s on a good day but sometimes it jumps to 8 9 even 10. My doctor put me on vicoden 7.5 to help deal with the pain. It help somewhat it would take my pain from 6 to maybe 3 or 4 so it did not it completly away but it helped. My doctor also had me doing physical therapy and I had cortisone shots but those made my foot hurt worse. The whole time I was seeing her she was trying to determine what was wrong. She had me do many test. She finally said about 3 weeks ago that I have nerve damage and I need to go to a neurologist. She switched my meds to a med called neurontin; she said it would help with nerve pain. I have been taking it for 3 weeks and it does not help at all. I really want my pain meds back but I feel awkward about asking. What should I do to get them back? On the other hand, if anyone can suggest any other medication that they think would work. In addition, I am 19 years old if that makes any difference. Any help is appreciated. Thank you

20090307163343AAMIzgM	Health;Mental Health	A painful problem with my 23 yo girl, any solution?	I have a 23 yo daughter, graduated, a very respected and great young adult. Unfortunately, she simply doesn't speak with us. This strong resentment began when she was 14. She went through a bad phase, something I could never understand happened in her brains and she turned into a very disrespctful and disobedient girl. Joined bad crowds, sometimes she drank. She was mean to her lil sister, she was jealous. Once she jooined some troubled teenagers and they graffited a wall and eneded up breaking 2 windows, she was drunk. She got a really harsh punishment that lasted for 4 months. She had to work as a janitor to pay for the damages and was grounded from almost everything. She got devastated, she realized wat she had done, apologized. Then she heard from us some words she could never get over. She begged for our trust and forgiviness and we said she had lost our trust, would have to face the consequences of her actions and only time would show if she had learned from her mistakes. She took from this we didn't live her, didn't consider her as a child, would never forgive and trust her again. That wasn't what we meant, though I agree we werer harsh and made her have a bad time. Fortunately she changed completely, never messed up again, made us proud but could bever see us as loving parents anymore. We tried everything but her life with us was then marked by pain, resentment, she coudn't get over. She never forgave herself and living with us was a terrible emotional pain to her.    And nothing has changed. Though she wrote us off, we know she still has emotional problems, still live those days, though she's a respected young professional. We had 2 daughters, but it's like we had only one. Last week, with the help of some of her freinds we convinced her to talk with us. We travelled 500 miles just to see her, she didn't want to talk with us in her apartment, so we had lunch with her. It was painful, our presence made her relive those days, she got emotionally disturbed, kept repeating the words we said when she begged for our trust. Then she said sorry, can't bear with this, and left. I was terribly upset, she left the restaurant in tears and on the verge of a nervous break down.   We got devastated, why had those things happen when she was 14? I can't understand how it could have a so bad effect. I don't know what to do, seems we lost our oldest daughter.

20090307163928AAR9pqD	Health;Mental Health	Bit Worried . . . ? Any Advice?	In the past 4/5 years I’ve had two periods of about 6/7 months each where I was really unhappy. . . but Im not quite sure if it was a full blown depression style thing or just normal. I was unhappy, all the time, cried for no reason and for a while self harmed. I lost all motivation to do anything, stopped going out, ended up missing half my classes, and had very little interest in talking to my friends. I couldn't sleep and had times when i felt really anxious and panicked for no good reason.   Both periods were accompanied by issues with food (which I haven't quite shaken off in between).   I can’t pinpoint any particular thing, if anything caused my feeling so down for so long. I never felt that I was unhappy about any one particular thing that I could think of.   I went to my doctor to see if he could shed any light on what was up . . . but he didn't really ask very much. So all I got out if that trip was some sleeping pills and anti-depressants. But I didn't take them cuz I didn't really feel that had determined that was what it was or that that was what I needed.   So the thing is . . . I’ve noticed that for the past few weeks I’ve been doing exactly what I did last time. I’ve essentially stopped eating . . . which I hadn't even noticed I was doing. I've had to stop drinking totally cuz I get upset and cry for no good reason.   I was just wondering what people thought this was and if any one has any idea what I should do about it?? I just feel like I’ve been all over the place for the pst few years and I’m really not up for dealing with this all over again. Thanks for any advice you can give me.

However some-days like this i wanna changed everything in me and in the world that surrounds me, but i don't have courage to do it. i am afraid of people i'm afraid that i am weak, any suggestions? i will surely accept the critics and insults just want to know how to get out of this sh....to open u to try to reach something in my life... please write your true opinions.... p.s. i'm a mess now so sorry about badly expressed sentences...

I have a history of knee problems and am hoping the injury is just a mild sprain. However in the past my knee has not swelled as much with a sprain, so I was wondering if the altitude has an effect on the swelling in my knee.

20090307165503AAXQFtu	Health;Women's Health	What could be causing this issue with my wife?	Me and my wife have, for a long time, had a healthy sexual relationship. In fact, she has often times had a higher sex drive than me!      Recently, however, she has been experiencing a multitude of health problems. She has lupus, and I have suspected that many of the issues of pain and other symptoms she has been experiencing throughout her body have been due to a flair up of lupus. However, she has also been experiencing some sexual difficulties as well. Occasionally, intercourse has been painful, especially if we are using a condom, although there have been many times where it has not been, and one time recently where it was painful in one position, and not so in another we tried a short time later. But very recently, she has also stopped lubricating naturally- she has become very dry even when very aroused. Just 6 months ago none of these things were issues.      My wife's sex drive seems unaffected except for anxiety over experiencing pain during intercourse. She is as unhappy as I am that this has become a barrier in the sexual aspect of our relationship.      But more than that, I am concerned for her overall health. I have prodded and prodded her to go see doctors about this, but due to our financial situation and lack of health insurance she has been dragging her heels. She keeps "toughing it out" and often won't proactively tell me when she isn't feeling well.      I will keep prodding her, but I was hoping someone with some knowledge might be able to tell me some possibilities of what we might be dealing with. Maybe it's just the lupus, which is serious in itself, or maybe its something else entirely. I know that no one could (and no responsible person would attempt to) make a diagnosis of a disease in a forum like this, but I am no gynocologist, and I am trying to get any lead or fish for any information that could help.      Some other information that might be relevant:   - She is NOT taking any contraceptives, either oral or otherwise.   - She was recently on some antibiotics for a dental infection, for which she also recieved two root canals, but these problems began well before she began taking the antibiotics, and I don't believe the dryness began until after she stopped taking them.   - Other than the above, she is not taking and has not taken any medication for quite some time.   - Just in case it's relevant, she has severe obstructive sleep apnea.      And please spare the "she needs to see a doctor" line, as I already know this, and am trying with everything I have to get her to act on it.      Thank you for any answers in advance, and God bless.

She said I should try it with my boyfriend, but I dont want to really start doing this if it is not safe.  As an experiment I put a hair elastic pretty tight around my boyfriend's testicles and then gave him a hand job and it definitely worked really well and now I realy want to do it more.

20090307173845AA0FgPI	Health;Mental Health	Do I have OCD or an Anxiety Disorder?  HELP!?	I'm 19.  When I was in 4th grade, I started getting these stomach aches that occurred maybe three or four times and week and from then, it's progressed and it much worse.  My stomach hurts everyday, probably around 9-10 hours a day unless I'm at home.  Going to the bathroom always helps.      Now, I'm afraid to go anywhere with anybody because I'm afraid that my stomach will hurt and I won't be able to go to the bathroom.  I've been to several doctors, but I just now figured out that I was afraid of not being able to go to the bathroom.  When I'm in situations where I know I won't be able to get to the bathroom (traffic, on a road in the middle of nowhere) I freak out and my stomach starts hurting and I feel like I have to go the bathroom even more.       Do I have OCD or some kind of anxiety disorder or something?  It's only gotten worse over the past nine years.  I almost never go out unless it's with a family member who knows and when I'm at home, I noticed that the pain isn't as bad and sometimes I think that it's all in my head but it's still miserable.  Should I go to a therapist?      Thank you for your answers.

So things have been a little bit rocky around the house,and when it gets like that I become so unhappy.I lock myself in my room for like two or three days without eating,all I will do is shower and drink water.No one comes to talk to me or check on me,so I just lay down and cry.I feel like lashing out and tearing up everything.I feel as if no one cares because when anyone else gets this way the get comfort,but when it's me they're like whatever.I guess i'm the outcast.Now when I get out of bed I feel dizzy and my knees get weak,my head hurts,and i'm always hot now,even if the air is on,i can't even take hot showers now without having to sit down in the tub.Can some one please help?
