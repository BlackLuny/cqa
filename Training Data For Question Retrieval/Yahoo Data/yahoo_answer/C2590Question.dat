Is there anything that would prevent that from working? For example, the engines not being the same size, or the Si engine needing extra parts that wouldn't come with a stock Dx model.

Common sense tells me that I already know the answer to this question, but I have to ask anyway to see what answers I get back! I'm a little bit frustrated about this situation and lets say this is me venting about it!!      My husband and his dad are traveling 3 1/2 hours away. They will be taking my husband's dads 2002 Dodge Ram truck which has a cracked windshield. When I say crack I mean it! It is cracked all the way from in front of the drivers side eye-level area and it makes a gigantic horseshoe down to the bottom of the windshield where the windshield wipers are and then comes back up eye-level with the passenger side. It's no little crack! My husband offered to drive our Suburban and his dad said no. His dad is a nice guy but he likes to have things be his way. That bugs me sometimes. It's supposed to be raining and it's a lot of high way and back winding roads. I insisted to my husband that he either drives them both or follows behind him for safety measures. Am I being out of line? I mean if you all think it's safe and that I am the crazy one for being worried then at least I know that then and can be assured that they will be safe!! My husband did express some concern about it too so I just don't know! If your windshield is cracked in our state it won't pass inspection so that maybe tells me something!! Help me!

My rear passenger side brake is making some interesting "scraping" sounds.  Today it progressed to a grind when I braked.  None of the other brakes appear to making any noises.  I have 80,000 km on my car now, so I am sure that all the pads need to be replaced, and because of these new sounds, I'm also guessing that I need a new caliper and rotor on the one brake.  Can anyone advise me as to what I should expect to pay to have this work done?  I will likely be taking my car to a local mechanic, as the nearest dealership is over an hour away.

There is a motor on the boat now, but I'm not sure what size.  I am thinking about replacing the motor, but not sure what size to buy.

I don't need for the boat to be the quickest in the marina, but don't want to put an undersized motor on the boat either.  In the end, I am looking to save money :)        Can anyone help?

She was afraid the motorcycle would get stolen while she was out of town over the new year. I thought she would get the motorcycle out of my yard when she got back. well it is March now and the motorcycle is still in my back yard. I have a large dog and a small yard and the motorcycle takes up a whole lot of space. I asked her to remove it and she said on monday it would be gone by thursday. thursday she came over drunk and half **** tried to move the bike. I'm disabled and can't move something that heavy. the motorcycle moved a foot and now is taking up more room than before. I want this motorcycle gone ASAP its really pissing me off and every time I see my friend I bring up the motorcycle and how nice it would be to have my yard back. How do I get this girl to understand this motorcycle HAS TO leave my yard? I already gave her the deadline of thursday and that obviously didn't work well. what do I do? since spring is here int he south I want to start planting flowers, but can't do it with this huge motorcycle in the middle of the yard. also if my dog damages it (scratches or whatever) am I liable?

20090227080225AA1j7WC	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Why does my boyfriend feel entitled to my car?	He did n't help me pay a dime for it. I think one of the reason that he feels so entitled is because he watches the movie "Baby Boy" a lot. In that movie, the main character ALWAYS had the girlfriend's car, putting all that ghetto ish on her car like rims and tinted windows. He even talks about putting his organization sticker on it:( I just laugh along but this is MY FIRST CAR,and I don't want ANY stickers on it. It's a reason why men pay more, on average for car insurance. Most of them drive like they are NA SCAR drivers. We live together so I am working on getting my stuff together and moving out. I hate people with an undeserved sense of entitlement. He hasn't driven in five years. And flunked the written test. Never even held a permit. And feels entitled to drive. I just fell like he's keeping me around at this point for my car.       Keep the answers relevant:)   Thanks

20090307133419AAkyAqr	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Looking at a car to buy; its steering wheel starts shaking at 55. What could be the problem? Expenses?	I'm looking at a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. The dealer let me take it for a test drive. When I get it up to 55, the steering wheel starts shaking. All 4 tires are dry rotted and the owner of the dealer says that's what's causing it to shake, but I'm not so sure as I would not consider myself a car expert. The price of the car, even if I replaced the tires myself, is actually pretty good, which is why I looked at it in the first place, but I am worried that if I buy the car and replace all 4 tires, the symptom will remain. I could be wrong, and I hope I am, because everything else about the car seems really nice. What are the various problems that can cause this symptom(again, the steering wheel doesn't start shaking until about 55), and what are the expenses?

20090307150301AABvc7U	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Scion	Did you know that the Scion TC is actually the Toyota Celica?	Did you know this. Toyota gave the rights to Scion. The TC on the Scion stands for Toyota Celica. Plus, if you go to the Toyota dealership, you'll notice a Scion sign right below the Toyota sign at your local Toyota dealership. Plus if you look at the car's exterior some of the features look the same. They have the exact same exhaust system and muffler included, and some of the exteriors are the same as well, maybe the interior as well, didn't look at the Scion's interior. So when you see a Scion TC and a Toyota Celica driving down the road in front of you, you can tell whomever you know that they're the exact same car, it's actually the New Toyota Celica.

20090307141601AAwfmFO	Cars & Transportation;Safety	I'm so scared to drive-should I just take buses?	I'm 19 and still don't have my license.  I had my permit but then I was out of country for 1 year and now it's expired.   Even when I had my permit, I practiced in parking lots and stuff but it's way different when driving on actual streets.   I just feel like I'm not responsible enough to drive- there are so many car accidents nowadays and I definitely cannot be responsible for someone's life or injury.  I once was in a car accident when my friend was driving, and though nobody was seriously injured the other driver's car was really damaged, and the police officers were so mean to us because it was our fault, and from that moment I became even more scared.   My mom tells me that I have to get my license but she won't understand how scared I am.  I know people think I'm weird for not having a license but I think buses and walking are easier and safer.      Is it weird that I don't want a license?   What should I do? No mean or negative comments please.
