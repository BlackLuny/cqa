0bd69a0d27e95121bac8f9b19a25d7b7aa	Have stayed there several times.  We rented one of the vacation homes.  It was really nice - we really enjoyed the dinner cruise on Lake Lure.  The golf course is excellent if you're into golf.  The main restaurant was a little fru-fru (men had to wear jackets, etc.) for us - we hung out at the deli/pub and fixed a meal or two at the house.   We don't go to the mountains to have to get all dressed up.    Have fun - this is a beautiful part of NC

5YPh5RXPaa	Well as your grandfather said, we're not black in skin colour.  However, the oldest official name for Egypt, by the Ancient Egyptians themselves, is Kmt (Keme) or Black. The Ancient Egyptians referred to themselves as Kmtjw (Kemetu) and Kmmw (Kmemu) or Black people.  I suggest that maybe when they compared themselves to other people they considered themselves as darker, hence black.  Blackness is also a quality of the rich fertile soil of the river banks and the delta region, so maybe the people described themselves according to the land they lived in.|`|hhhk499qaa	because egypt is in africa. so they think that egyptians are black. also there's a city called "aswan", they are all black there.|`|ravzJTVOaa	we must have the time and patience to explain to others abt Egypt and Egyptians .  thanks for the Q.|`|tFoFchuEaa	Probably due to lack of education, or simple ignorance.    They're probably the same people who have no clue who Afrikaners are, or that Russia has many people who look Asian as part of their population.|`|deTJcdv9aa	well because many white ppl will call non white people with darker skin black, all africa, Middle east, India, and Pacific Islanders, and Native Australians are all called black. even Native People from New Zealand who are much lighter then egyptians are called Black.  and egyptians people are not white for sure.  look at Barack Obama, i think maybe 60 Million egyptians are darker then him,|`|AA12365543	Only Black Americans lacking identity and culture believe that.  They make up weird things. Like they say Jews were originally Blacks, Jesus was Black, Mozart and Bethoven were black,ect.      Weird stuff|`|o5QnH6ptaa	actually people think that people from sudan and somalia are black but not egyptians.|`|7PCssHMIaa	Stupidity and lack of common sense?|`|AlbJmy7aaa	Because some are.  My falucca captain was.    If you head down the Nile a ways, you will meet them. I got to trade with some.  They are good people.    Aswan is very central to this culture. Egypt is in Africa and borders Sudan.|`|43b4f93a63d1a5f538232f1ddc8bf9f6aa	cuz when Africa is mentioned, what comes to people's mind is black, so seeing as Egypt is a part of Africa, many people assume Egyptians are black. Anyway, black or white, yellow or green, doesn't matter, it's all good. we're all human beings.|`|TXJzsyHqaa	kaman this question again. tayeb yalla...       first of all egypt is geographically where... in africa...    why is egypt considered a middle eastern or arab country?   becuase in 640 A.D. egypt was invaded by islamic arabs during the the second caliph of the fatmid army of Amr ibn al-as..... this is why most of the egyptians now look heavily arab and this is also why egyptians speak arabic... nationaly the identity of egypt is arab.. why becuase about 85% of the population is of arab muslim descent and the other 15% is of coptic descent... do some more research on the coptic identity.. you find things  that are all more interesting.   now as for why where egyptians considered black.. first of all the refrence to  kemet.. being black.. that is wrong... kemet refered to the lands of of egypt.. it was known as kemet lands or black lands.. the people where never considered black and they never considered themselves black.. egypt is at the corner of africa and was the pinnical of  most of the ancient world.. you  had many jews in alexandria after alexander the great of mecadonia  called this his home.. if you look at other north african people tunisa algiers libya. morracco. most of the people that live in these regions where particularly dark... yet not as dark as many of the other africans.. nonetheless they had the same shared african features... also egypt often times was invaded in the ancient world and also made treaties with other empires.. one empire was in  modern day syria, or ancient mesopotamia... egypt was also known as oum el donia. mother of the earth becuase many empires relyed and  and kept their supplies of crops and agriculture in egypt..   siani area its on the border of the african and asianic continents.. so  would one say that egyptians are asian.. they also claim that egyptians are indo european... this is also uncertain.. egyptians are simply egyptians.. probably the most diverse people you will ever come to know.. i don't think egyptians where ever pure of 100% pure ancient egyptian blood..  no one was really.. again..  look and distinguish.. from the equater up... from the top of ethiopia to the bottom of egypt and as well as other northafrican countries.. africans range in features as well as  skin tone..
bda465ikaa	My bank charges 1% + $1 per transaction to get foreign currency out of an ATM. Exchanging cash is usually several times as much. Just pull money out of the ATM in the local currency. It saves you the risk of carrying around a lot of cash.  ========  If you are talking about serious currency that you don't want anyone to know about, then be aware that if you board a plane with more than the equivalent of $10,000 in easily converted valuables (cash, bonds, etc.) then you are required to fill out an IRS form. If you decline to fill out the form, they can confiscate the currency. It is not illegal to carry that much currency, but it is illegal not to report it.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	If your a foreigner, you probably will get good exchange rate since your coming from the UK to Las Vegas.

KS2OHXCRaa	Train would be the way to go. Most low frill airlines don't fly Paris-London given the convenience of the train, making the flying route unprofitable to run. As for Paris-Norwich, the Norwich Airport has limited service route and I can't find one that serves Paris.    Paris-London:  To travel Paris-London, take the Eurostar train (http://www.eurostar.com/dynamic/index.js... ). The earlier you buy the ticket, the likely you are to get the ticket at the cheapest price, and the journey itself from city to city is less than 2 1/2 hours.     Paris-Norwich (via London):  Take the Eurostar to London St Pancras (King's Cross), get a underground to London Liverpool Street Station, and from there another train to Norwich (http://www.nationalexpresseastanglia.com... ).  The journey time is just over 1 1/2 hours between London and Norwich.|`|IrqQPAnpaa	Probably the train if London but the plane if Norwich, as with the train to London you then have to take account travel prices from London to Norwich but Im no expert.  I live in Norwich! :)|`|apJbZPL4aa	train of course is much more cheaper depending on what station chosen|`|J1nPQQ1Saa	Go to the store, get a long distance calling card for 5 - 10 dollars.  Come back to your computer and Google or Yahoo the air ports and train stations of those regions. Then call them for details.  It's the best sure way, the right way, the only way to know for sure.

HlKwDrowaa	Toronto is alright, but I don't even see how Toronto can even compare to NY. There's much more to do, more to see, lots of character/history. I personally love bigger cities more. I've only spent about a month in NY but I wish I could live there. The skyline, the life style, the shopping, the famous things you see on tv, waking up in the morning and taking a stroll through central park. It's amazing. Canada and Toronto picture perfect? Are you on crack or just full of yourself? lol

TRTed54Maa	No can do. Your Parent can only walk you to the Security section (mental detectors) and where your passport is checked.    Departure Lounge is Incorrect, this is where you wait to Board your flight once you have gone through departure checks.|`|AA11366224	Because of higher security requirements at UK airports in recent years, this is no longer possible.  A parent or friend can help you check in and take you as far as the security gates.  After that you're on your own.    Gatwick is easy.  If people my age can cope with it, a 16 year old should have no problems.  Get through security in good time.  Have a good look around the departure lounge and you'll see plenty of signs showing where the gates are.  Look at the screen from time to time until your gate is shown - then go to it.    If you get confused, there's a help desk where they're used to dealing with confused passengers.  If you're late getting to the boarding gate (because you've been delayed in the bar) they'll start calling your name over the PA.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	departure lounge not the gate sorry.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	No.|`|NmSSKnnWaa	only to departure gate|`|23vKOyBraa	No, but it really will be simple, once you get in to the airport and past security. When you check in (with your parents) you will get a boarding pass (a piece of paper with your seat number for the plane on). This boarding pass will have a GATE NUMBER on it - and most likely the staff will circle it in pen to highlight it to you.    Just follow the hundreds of signs pointing you to that number.    It might be Gate Number 23 for example, that is ONE SIMPLE number, that's all you need to remember. There will be so many signs as to which way to go it really will be simple. Don't worry. If stuck, ask someone, even other passengers will probably help you.    And even if you do get lost, because you are now in the computer system (you checked in and got boarding pass) the plane will not leave without you. They will make PA announcements and call your name etc.    You'll be fine, really.|`|xif22nwoaa	Actually, most airports do allow minors to be accompanied beyond security and to the gate by their parents.  You should call Virgin Atlantic and ask them ahead of time, but you can even ask when you check in.  They have a bit of discretion regarding gate passes, which will allow at least one parent to take you through security and to your gate.    Edited - again, there is discretion.  They can certainly say no, but it is something they have the ability to do.  My friend accompanied her 14-year-old through security and to the gate a few weeks ago.  Several months ago, another friend was traveling alone with her 3 children, and they gave a gate pass to her husband so that he could help her get through security and to the gate.  So they CAN do it, but they can also decline to do it.  Doesn't hurt to ask.  You're old enough that they might say no, but they will find someone to help you if you want.  But it is possible that a parent could go with you.|`|XTbYi36Jaa	The limit your parent can stay with you until is the security part. I'm sure you won't get lost, just make sure you get a map (I got mine off of the internet). And if you are unsure at any point just ask either staff or any other traveller. Good luck :)|`|8Ev0yYwdaa	Only until where you enter the duty free, from there its easy, you got a gate number - there are signs - you follow the signs - and you wait.|`|ZXpNuOU0aa	I'm afraid Melissa is wrong. A parent can only take you as far as security, they have to produce a boarding card to go any further. Some airlines provide an attendant (from the airline you are travelling with) if you don't want to travel alone
vEoJO3gBaa	Go somewhere with a beach! Like Florida. I would say Cali but that's far! Make sure you make some really good road mixes with good songs! Find places like hostels to stay on the way... way cheaper than hotels! Try looking for quirky places to stop along the way.. like the worlds biggest log of cheese... or something! Great photo opps! Pack lots of snacks and drinks so you wont have to stop all the time for new food or drinks! And have fun! Dont let little things get to you! Just go with the flow!|`|fukzl8oaaa	Head South|`|17ILwpI5aa	have no plan. have some kind of destination and the in between you wing it.  nothing worse than having plans being shot (which is likely for a road trip either that or stress and frustration occurs)  enjoy every moment and go on an adventure!! go balls out head out to CALI!!!  soak up some rays enjoy the west coast!
mAV5MJQnaa	You can go to ticketmaster and purchase the tickets there, I am pretty sure they will go on sale, then after a while it will be discontinued.
ZPxJNpMxaa	SA property market is a lot cheaper than the UK.    Depending where you stay in SA will dictate prices with affluent suburbs in Johannesburg and Cape Town and some smaller towns along the Eastern Coast like Plettenburg Bay and others being very expensive.    However, in smaller towns one can still purchase a comfortable home, with double amenities, for anything from R750,000 to R950,000, so you can purchase a comfortable home for about 80,000 pounds in these regions.    Price of housing is really dictated by the city and the area within each city/town.    The property market has done exceptionally well over the past 5 or so years but the boom has now stabilized and it is currently a buyers market.

83vhCGW1aa	For seafood, there's Bay 13 Phone: 503/227-1133 701 NW 13th if you like French food, check out Le Bouchon   Phone: 503/248-2193 517 NW 14th.  There are hundreds of restaurants in the Pearl district though, so picking just the right one depends on what type of date it is. I know you can find a complete list at pearldistrict.com.    While I'm at it, I have a little more free advice.  I don't know if you live in Portland or not, but if you do, you should check out Clear.  It's WiMax internet access which is wicked fast, and you can access the internet anywhere you go in the metro area.  Right now it's just in Portland, but they're planning on expanding to other cities soon.

da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	Perth - is Australia's biggest link to Asia and is a fairly relaxed but small city.    Sydney - is Australia's main port for tourists, business, etc., has ofcourse 2 of the worlds biggest landmarks, and celebrities are frequently visiting.    Melbourne - similar to Sydney, but isn't the main port and has lesser-known, lesser-reputable landmarks.     Adelaide - forget it. My friend, who I trust dearly, says it is like a retirement village.    Darwin - haven't been, and don't know anyone who has been. Perhaps this says something about the population there.    Canberra - oh please, Canberra barely has a city and the only people who live there are there for business.    Hobart - is not bad, but very quiet. You may like this attribute but I hate it.    Brisbane - is my favourite city, it has as many leisure facilities as business facilities, and is expected to be Australia's second largest city (overtaking Melbourne as the current second largest city) by 2020.    Hopefully my review of the state capitals has given you some insight into Australian states. :)     - Clarke.|`|iFZqTzcUaa	i live in perth, its quiet, cleaner and more spread out. Perth has a need for a car more then melbourne. Perth has nice public transport, but doesn't cover the metro area. Melbourne is better suited to tourism and has more entertainment. Im not sure about sydney.|`|mCXEPVNzaa	Perth is, in my opinion, the nicest of the three. It's got great weather pretty-much all the time, and a lot of varied biomes to visit in different driving directions, a short way away. It's clean and orderly (not that the others aren't) and it's got one of the coolest "sister cities" in the world, in Freemantle. The big drawback to Perth is that it's a long way from... well... *anywhere*. It's actually closer, as the crow flies, to Singapore than it is to Sydney. The neat part is that Thai Airways flies dailies to Bangkok and Phuket from Perth, and I love southeast asia, so if I were living in Australia I'd definitely live in Perth. Coral Bay is some of the best snorkeling in the country, in my opinion, despite being on the opposite side of the country from the G-B-R.|`|qSjJwJ28aa	Perth has around 1.5million people, so, in Australian standards, it is quite a large city. It is definitely much more beautiful than Sydney and Melbourne and way more relaxed. There is alot of money in Perth due to the mining boom of Western Australia, so the city is very modern and clean with pretty good infrastructure. I have always said that if Perth wasn't so far from my home town and family I would move there in a heart beat.  It's true about Fremantle, it is a great part of the city, and the beaches in Perth are fantastic, not to mention the great wine region of Margaret River to the south and Swan Valley - some of my favourite parts of South West WA.

AA10988215	There are only 2 shops that I think this might be.  The first is "Forbidden Planet" which sells character toys/gifts (but it's not really a shop for children!) as well as Graphic Novels and Magazines.  The secnd is "Harley C." which is a few doors up from "Forbidden Planet".  This shop isn't particularly 'gothy' but it sells clothes and accessories that are kind of 'punky'!    I have a feeling you're talking about Forbidden Planet though.    Good luck getting your watch! :)|`|EJyZ5D0yaa	The Shop Is Called "Forbidden Planet"   if the shop has like action figures on they're window screen and has a yu gi oh poster on the door then its forbidden planet.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	I can't think of the shop you mean - the shop in the location you describe sells perfume, I think.

7Y2jmO7Taa	I live in NYC, and no, I could not live elsewhere.    I actually DID try it - my husband got a job in a small town in Massachusetts (no, not near Boston, pretty far away from everything, actually.) I HATED it there! I so longed to come back to NYC! I finally convinced my husband that I had to move back and eventually we did. (Long complicated story, but we did the commuter marriage for a while before he landed a comparable job here.)     I would never leave again.     NYC has diversity (yes, that's important!) It has great culture - theater like no other city in the U.S., great museums, and all sorts of undefinable cultural activities. It has the best, most far reaching, most reliable mass transit system in the U.S. Oh, and some of the best restaurants, too. And many, many more wonderful restaurants just in general, not just a few great ones, and at all different price levels, too.    I couldn't live somewhere without great theater, great mass transit, and great diversity. And the good food helps, too!    KEEP Indianapolis!|`|84H5kMD7aa	it really depends on how small the town is. if the town has a single main street and one grocery store i don't think i would rather that than living in a huge city with everything at my disposal. that being said, there are advantages to living in small towns, like knowing everyone around, feeling safer, and having a lot of space.|`|nSMizwOqaa	I'm from a small town and I like it because you know everyone or almost everyone. Right now I want to go to a big city, more things to do, but when I'm older I'd like to be back in a small town. I'm kind of like the song Alabama Clay by Garth Brooks.|`|lPDRQH7aaa	I would never move away from NYC. I was born and raised in a very small town in Michigan and I hated it. The closest mall was 1 hour away. I hated it and throughout my teenage years I told myself I was not going to stay there and I was going to move to NYC the time I turned 18. I did for a year went to college moved back and I love it and would never ever move to a small town.
S4Vn4Kpoaa	Well with the recession and everything holidays are costing a fortune. I saw that because I'm planning on going inter railing this spring (I kind of have to because I'm on a gap year and I wouldn't get this chance again for a long time - otherwise I wouldn't have gone this year) and what was going to cost me 1000 pounds is now costing me 1600 (not because I'm doing more things but only because euro = pound)  So what I would say to you is.. are you getting much out from going this year or you think maybe you can wait for sometime for things to maybe settle down on a global scale and then you could. You'd probably save some money that way anyway - which you could put in your collection for getting an apartment. fair enough?   (ALTHOUGH Paris IS a beautiful city)|`|cCvA9kMiaa	Get an apartment will be the wise choice. France is in deep **** at the moment. Tomorrow will be a big strike day. All government offices and post offices will be closed. Besides, France is on it's way to recession and crime rate is very high.It's a bad year that everything doesn't go right. Even the south which rarely snows had 12cm of snow in Marseille 2 weeks ago. I live in France and I am telling you the truth. Don't believe any illusion you listen or those who are so patriotic about their country in France.|`|BiNeNcDyaa	GO to france... been all over europe paris is the best city! you wont regret!|`|GSn3m2sAaa	If the option is between moving out of your parents house, or going on an awesome vacation, I say MOVE OUT! you can always save for a vacation next year :P
lys5kB9Daa	If you lived right near the major airport and it was a straight shot there in 3 hours and then you just went right to the hotel I would obviously say do that. but since you would have to go through all that to fly i would go with the drive. you wont be the one driving so you can tend to your son along the way. he should sleep alot. plus i think it would be much easier to just put him and his stuff in the car once, rather than lugging it in one car, the airport, the airplane, airport, airplane, another car. see what i mean? lol
XxklaKViaa	I have heard that Carnival is trashy.  However, I hear if you're a high school / college student it is a lot of fun and really worth going.  Restrictions are pretty important to know, because a lot of times cruses won't even let you go if you are under 21.  But this lets you go if you are accompanied by someone who is 21 or older.    I have only experienced Celebrity cruse lines, and they are REALLY nice.  They are the ones that have rock climbing walls and everything.  There are a little more restrictions (like one day you have to dress up for dinner, and you always have to sit at the same table at the same time for dinner) but everything is really clean and the food is great.  I would really recommend going on Celebrity, but I do hear many college age students prefer Carnival.|`|17ILwpI5aa	I am a college student and I love traveling.

I could go on and on and on and on about things you could do in the big city, but I won't, due to a limit of how much I can write. I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.    While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts. Here is the official website >>> http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/    Listed below are some excellent restaurants you should definitely try out.

I don't even do half of my shopping in New York; I do it in either Paramus, New Jersey or online. However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.    As far as attractions, there are a lot of things you should go to see. You should definitely try to go see the Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. The website Im giving you is for directions to the ferry station, where you can go see Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. Unfortunately, the interior of the Statue Of Liberty is closed, but the wonderful statue is beautiful. The website is here >>>> http://www.ny.com/transportation/ellis.h...

Also, for transportation, there are maps in subway cars and on subway trains, and there are also maps in buses. The maps at bus stops are usually just for the bus route.    I hope this guide has helped you, and I hope you enjoy the many wonders you will find in New York City!|`|LrGhFAkkaa	The usual "suspects" when going to NYC is the statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Times Square, Empire State Building, Brooklyn Bridge, Top of the Rock, going to a sport event, going to a Broadway show etc. WHat to see and do depends on your interests and what time of the year you go. I have been there twice with my wife and here are a couple of trip reports with photos, links and maps that might be of some help: http://gardkarlsen.com/NYC_travelogue_20... and http://gardkarlsen.com/new_york_city_tri... . You can get all sorts of food in NYC...what cuisine do you like? I would of course recommend that you try out the cheese cake at Junior's...it is great :-)    Regards  Gard|`|iU8BTXZNaa	You should DEFINITELY go to Times Square,Empire State Building or Macy's 34th Street if you want to shop.There are many places to eats that's why I can't personally choose one for you.Hope this Information Was Useful and Have A Great Trip!|`|LMDyDxYwaa	You're getting the stock answers and there is nothing wrong with that, but there is a lot to NYC that you can do to make your trip unique.  I reccomend you tick of the mid town basics on the first day (Times Square, Roc Center, Empire State Building, Grand Central Station) and then go exploring. Shop in SOHO and go eat at a noodle shop (Momofuku) in the East Village when your done.  Spend a half day in Central Park and walk up Madison Ave to see crazy boutiques and hit MOMA on the upper east side.  If you have time take a cab through 125th st so you can say you saw Harlem  (This is area is totally safe day and night).  Whatever you do, try to make your trip unique.
jz9CnL2Eaa	Basically you want to avoid west and central Mesa, south of University and north of the 60.  Pretty much anything east of Gilbert Road is fine.  Generally speaking, the further east you go, the better the area, although most of the areas around Dobson Ranch (in southwest Mesa) are fine.   Stay away from trailer park areas that do not cater to over 55 crowds or snowbirds in general.   Stay away from cheap apartments in the areas I suggested you avoid - some are quite horrible.|`|jWNcZ0zBaa	AH MAN! People see a few minorities around and automatically think it's GHETTO!....LOL    Mesa is nice if you like Diversity. If you like to be around Rich WHITE Snooty people that think they live in Beverly Hills, move to Awatukee.|`|E4UVvFInaa	All of them.

It's not that bad, but I preferred living in Chandler. As others have said, the farther east you go, the better it is. Just do your research on the crime rates in specific areas.|`|ee3fc7c33199d963f5fa30894395146daa	Umm, all of it, chandler and ahwatukee is close and nicer
WE0pqxIDaa	1: Ask and keep asking. However, you won't get instant answers because you might find that, off the tops of their heads, no one will know the answers you want for sure! Not even U.S. Customs agents! Why? Because a "pocket bike" is a product most people haven't even heard about! Therefore, along this line, I myself also have to say, "I don't know for sure"!    2. Ask U.S Customs, before you travel. They're the number one authority on the subject (of Federal customs duties). After they do some research on the subject, they should be able to give you the exact information you need!    3. Do some research before you go. This is the easiest step. Generally speaking, if you're an U.S. resident, and if you travel to and buy stuff in Canada, you have an exemption when you return to the U.S. And the exemption is pretty generous. For example, If your stay in Canada is 48 hours or longer, I believe the U.S. exemption is so generous that you won't pay any (Federal) duty on $400 worth of stuff. However, to be on the safe side, you need to ask first!     4. My research says, if you're a returning U.S. resident, you  may take home duty-free items valued up to US$600 (retail), provided they are properly declared to the customs inspector. All items should accompany you to be considered duty free. You can claim this $600 duty-free exemption once every 30 days, provided you're outside the U.S. for 48 hrs. This $600 exemption can be pooled for a family living in the same household and traveling together, i.e. a family of 4 can take home $2,400 worth of duty-free stuff.    5. Ask your local DMV as well, before you travel and/or buy motorized stuff. This is important! Because, FYI, motorized things are licensed by individual states, not the Feds! Therefore, after you successfully cross the Canadian border, it's your State DMV that you need to worry about. They're the agency that charges you additional taxes and fees for all kinds of things, including A) registration, B) licensing, C) smog testing, D) emission testing, and/or E) other things.     6. As to the DMV, my costliest experience was my "need" for a California emission sticker. This was many years ago, and, in California, I paid $500 for a California emission sticker.(no, not for the one on the rear plate, but for a separate one that goes under the hood, on the driver's side, next to the Federal emission sticker! Thanks to inflation, this $500 was the equivalent of paying $1,000 today! Registration fees, license plate fees, smog testing, and emission testing were additional, but not more than $200. The DMV also requires that you buy insurance, show them proof, and there are drivers in their early 20s who pay up to $1,200 per 6 months, for insurance only!     I hope this helps.|`|14K1Vt3Paa	I don't know for sure but would suggest you contact a U.S Customs Office. They should  give you the exact information required.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I don't know for sure so...I DON'T KNOW.

fHfVRcqbaa	A few years ago, my husband and I took a train ride up to the Grand Canyon from some little town in the middle of nowhere after a trip to Las Vegas.  Combine it with a trip to the Petrified Forest, and you have a Natural Wonder combo.  The Grand Canyon is AMAZING.    Also, Niagra Falls is pretty amazing, but you really have to go to the Canadian side to see the full effect of both of the falls.  There are a few things to do on the US side, but Canada is way better.    Another place, IMHO that is a natural wonder is the Coral Reefs in the Keys.  Off of Key Largo is a huge National Park--John Pennycamp is what it is called, I believe.  Even if you don't scuba dive, you can snorkel or do a glass bottom boat.  Warm, sun, water--perfect for all ages!    Of course, you can't overlook the glaciers in Montana or Yellowstone National Park either.  Alaska and Hawaii are in categories all their own.  I have always wanted to see both and haven't yet had the pleasure.    Good luck to you and the family planning a trip.  Hope you find the perfect place and be sure to send us a post card!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	pictured rocks national lake shore in Michigan's upper peninsula, the cruise you can take is AWESOME!!! there are over 300 waterfalls up there and hundreds of inland lakes.  most people go to the upper  Tahquamenon Falls
AA12353784	Try the Gumtree site in Sydney. At least a dozen postings a day for nanny positions so you could arrange something before you travel.

Australia standardly doesn't use Nannies, but childcare is a really big industry here in Australia.    If you could find a childcare agency here in Australia, and provide them with enough documentation to prove they can trust you with children (Australian law), then they might sponsor you for a working visa.    That is your best chance of getting into the country unless you get into a university here, or exchange along with him.    Good luck.|`|RJpekNPfaa	As long as you have a working visa or a working holiday visa, you can work where you want.     http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...

There is US Cable but dont think they are in Denver anymore, plus there channel line up sucked, you have to pay extra for Scifi or even the food network.|`|0DUwsNAyaa	Dish network $29.99 a  month|`|7e7e66e61bc00173161b8dc44d25b035aa	As far as I know, Comcast is the only CABLE TV option in Denver.  Now, I could be wrong about that, but I just spent a bit of time on "go2broadband.com" and couldn't find any other options.    Anyhow, Qwest is tied in with DirectTV...i.e. satellite TV, not cable.  Personally, I recommend their service over cable, if you can get it.    However, you will have to scrap your DVR if you switch to satellite, as the two technologies are not interchangeable.
94b8KImYaa	It is part of a mediterranean cruise which will stop in Civitavecchia. <br>  This is the closest port to Rome, and Rome is about an hour away. <br>  The ship will offer shore excursions to Vatican City, often also transportation by bus to the town (arranged by the cruise line and need to be paid onboard) <br>  Another easy way to get to Rome and to avoid the traffic is to go by train.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Yes.  Any cruise that takes you to Civitiveccia (the port closest to Rome) will get you close.  It is just under an hour to get from the dock  into Rome by bus, and if your stop is for a full day, your ship will probably run busses into the city and pick you up later and get you back to the ship.  I know it can be cheaper to go off on your own for most shore excursions, but I really urge people to go ahead and pay the premium for Rome!  Traffic can be horrible, particularly toward the late afternoon, and if you are on a ship-sponsored thing the ship will wait for you if you are late.  If you are on your own, the ship will leave without you.
ZPxJNpMxaa	Let me start with are the police effective or corrupt? The police have a reputation for being corrupt and cases of corrupt policeman are on the increase. Jackie Selebe, the commissioner of police is facing criminal and corruption charges, amongst a number of others and this is what has been exposed, it is too frightening to even think how rife it is.<br>  <br>  Crime is everywhere in the world but some of our crime statistics unfortunately speak for themselves, so it is important irrespective of where you are in SA to take common sense precautions as well as consistently being vigilant.<br>  <br>  I have either spent quite some time in or lived in the 4 cities you have mentioned and without exception each city has its "no go" areas, but each city also has a lot to do and see. The CBD of Johannesburg is the worst of the 4. Cape Town for me is by far the best city and if I were you I would spend more time there than in the other cities.<br>  <br>  Here is a helpful link in terms of safety in SA, there are many more just search for them on this forum.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Do not believe everything you read about SA, SA is without a doubt worth a visit, and that is not a biased opinion, the number of tourists visiting SA is on the increase.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	We just got back from a vacation to SA.

Yes, we do have crime in South Africa, and yes, people are sometimes threatened with weapons.  <br>  If you use common sense, you can be save in almost any area.  <br>  Some of the rural areas should not be visited without a trustworthy guide/tourgroup.  Do not drive in areas that you are not familiar with, and make sure that you know where you are going.  Do not visit areas alone at night, make sure that you are in a group. <br>  I think of the cities you mentioned, Johannesburg is most likely to be the more dangerous city.  <br>  I would suggest that you do not visit South Africa on your own, espesially if you are a girl.  <br>  Unfortunately we do have corrupt police officials, and they are not always effective.  <br>  South Africa is a beautiful country with lots to see and do.<br>  And by the way, South Africa - Johannesburg - presented the Miss World competition in December 2008 without any problems.|`|AA12028509	i've been to South Africa several times over the past few years ... and i'm still alive. this doesn't mean there's no crime or danger, but if you take care, you shouldn't have any problems. <br>  <br>  you say you want to visit Jo'burg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban. now i must say that the most interesting, beautiful parts of the country aren't in these cities.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	Four hours from the base to the summit is feasible if you are fit and the weather is kind. It is generally regarded as a day-long excursion to get up and back down.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Oh, sounds like going to half dome in Yosemite here.  My brother and dad climbed up there.   Clouds Rest takes even longer.  There are two water falls, also, that are very good to climb up to the top of:  Vernal Falls, and Nevada Falls.  Vernal Falls isn't too much of a hike---might take 2 hrs. each way, but the others take longer like all day.  Most people who go to clouds rest stay overnight somewhere up there and climb down the next day.  My dad went all the way up and back in one day, but it was dangerous doing it that way---started out in the dark and came back in the dark.  This is somewhere around the central California.

PSiNv7gUaa	They offer an e-Ticket on their website where you pay the child's price, then get a second day free.  I would HIGHLY recommend getting it, as you will likely need the second day, at least part of it.  I know I did.<br>  <br>  For one thing, some of the exhibits are so interesting you wind up staying at them longer that you intended (as I did).  You have lines to wait in for the rides, plus a 45+ minute wait time for the killer whale show if you want a good seat (the only other show I went to was Blue Horizons, I got in line about 5 minutes before they started letting people in and still got a seat front and center).  The shows themselves are about 30 minutes long.  Things like Dolphin Cove take time (if you want to feed the dolphins) because the line for fish is so long.  Everyone I was in line with stayed in the feeding/petting area until we were kicked out by the trainers.  Also there is a line wait for the shark encounter (they only allow a certain amount of people in the building at once, depending on when you get in line you could be waiting for 10-20 minutes).  Depending on the time of day you eat lunch, you could be in line for a long time.  Both days I went there was at least a 20 minute wait in the restaurants (for sit-down meals, there are quick-service stands around the park if you don't care to sit down and relax in air-conditioning).  All of this PLUS there is still a lot of walking to do (it's a large park).  Depending on how you plan ahead, you may be able to do it all in order...  Otherwise you will be hopping all over the park.<br>  <br>  I would DEFINITELY plan on the second day, otherwise you will probably have to cut a lot out (you have about 4 hours in shows planned alone, that combined with waiting in line to get in eats up a lot of your day!).|`|M7qU5MdOaa	One day is fine...when you enter the park, take 10minutes and plan out your schedule for that day(according timetable of the shows.)  If you plan it right you should be able to see eveything in the park and still have time left over.  Don't panic or stress yourself too much to see everythng.  Remember, you're there for a vacation.  Relax enjoy yourself and so what if you miss a show or two.  Have a good time.|`|JLayHNZCaa	It is very difficult to see everything in one day.  They time the shows such that you have to crisscross the park to get to them and that pretty much means to do absolutely all the shows, two days are required.|`|sF13O9Fmaa	Yes, a full day is long enough. I always get a map when I enter the park which gives you all the show times, then make a plan of what order you are going to do them in.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|tV7ZYIeEaa	Yes, one day is enough for Sea World. All you have to do is work around the shows. Times for shows are scattered throughout the day so once you get the map/times guide for the day sit a min and plan it out. Once the show is over see exhibits around the show and move on. They rec you arrive at least 15-20 mins before the show.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	In my trips to Sea World, I have never had any problem seeing everything in one day.  I usually don't see all the shows, though.  You might have to take out a show or two.

If you don't know what the word means in Korean, then try to look it up in a Korean-English dictionary, and translate it. Also, the Korean sentence structure is sorta backwards from English, so you should adjust the sentence when you understand the general meaning of what it is saying.

It's not just a poor person's disease. It can be transmitted through many routes as well. For all we know, there could be a child from a rich family with the HIV virus because his mother was an intravenous drug user and used a dirty shooter.How is that good?<br>  <br>  And what do you mean "poor people who are of no value to our country" exactly? I don't care if I'm not African. Human life is human life, red, black, yellow, brown, white, American, European, African. LIFE is valuable. Someone may not have financial value, but what about character value? Have you not seen the possibilities in these people? Are you not impoverished? If not, watch someone who is. You think there's nothing but suffering and pain to be had with them? I have been homeless, or "of no value" myself. Yet I was able to do enough to sustain myself. I may have not been a profit, but I wasn't a dreg. And even if someone can take your silver and gold, they cannot take your ability to love, to laugh, to dance. When there is nothing left, you still have free will. The use of that free will and the brains in their heads are what create someone's worth. Not money. Anyone so unfortunate as to not be able to find value in anything but Earthly goods has obviously never truly lived enough to feel the difference between true pain and pure joy. And I pity the day that they find themselves in hardship and are so wrapped up in their own shallow ways that they find themselves worthless and put themselves in a self-fulfilling prophecy of such because they were never educated enough to see the contrary. Only that person is a drag on society. Everyone will suffer hardship. In some way or another everyone does. It doesn't matter whether it's with AIDS, a bad business move, a family tragedy. EVERYONE will spend time as the meek for a spell. The only important question about it is: How will you refrain from idling yourself into despair and worthlessness?<br>  <br>  <br>  Also- "Tired of being serious": don't forget that we're talking about disease. We must take into account the fact that certain German leaders also put handicapped people in the gas chambers too. And Vlad the Impaler took all the people with disease and invited them to a nice dinner, and as they were finishing eating, he sealed the exits off and lit the place on fire, burning them all alive in the end.|`|t1zWa5vHaa	Does it matter who dies from AIDS? The poor; the rich? We're all still children of God... They too have families who miss them and mourn them when they pass away. Everyone has the right to live, so how you can say that they have no value, well, I think you need some help there. Obviously AIDS is not a good thing - for any country!|`|53adca422c280d605197c5d02cab2b26aa	No its not a good thing.|`|xcDwLp4uaa	No. It is immoral to even think such a thing. These are people we are talking about fellow South Africans you can't wish them to be exterminated like cockroaches. Every single person is born with the potential to be great, to contribute to the world in their own way. Just because someone is born into poverty it doesn't mean their life is of any less value than someone born into wealth. <br>  <br>  What we need is a strong, healthy workforce to help make South Africa stronger economically. Unskilled labor is needed in many industries. There are many jobs that need people who are willing to work hard to provide for their families so that each generation can get stronger and stronger.  <br>  <br>  We don't want people to be sick and dying because it puts a strain on all of our social services but most importantly on the families affected. How are our poor going to be uplifted if the breadwinners (the hardest hit by the Aids epidemic) are dying leaving behind young children and the elderly? The children are too young to work but many of them have to quit school to look after even younger siblings, to beg on the street for food or run errands. The worst case scenario is that these children get sucked into a life of crime out of sheer desperation. Without an education and a loving family (no matter how poor) they cannot escape poverty. It is a vicious circle.<br>  <br>  People like you who don't recognise the value of life add no value to the country.|`|tr5ig7eXaa	While it does decrease the number of poor people, it also decreases total poulation. in swaziland for example they are slowly dieing out because of AIDS. and after a while if all the poor people die out then the poorest fo the rich people become the poor people, so it slowly wipes out the whole country. all in all i would say, no AIDS is not a good thing for any country|`|1EfUx0dxaa	Who are you to decide whose life has value? Blommie you must read more about AIDS first before making silly comments. <br>  <br>  1. highest prevalence is among 16- 34 yr olds. Our economic labour force i.e usually the bread winners<br>  <br>  2. When parents pass away, they leave behind many orphans who become even more poor and end up on the streets. <br>  <br>  AIDS does not solve problems of poverty it exacerbates it.|`|zEoRcL91aa	HIV was spread by sex tourism  - rich horny folk abusing poor locals.|`|89968071bd5c93aed6d2d07f9cceeda7aa	Wait until you or someone close is infected, and see if you can ask that question again.

No, most people who die from AIDS are not poor especially in this country where health care actually exists unlike other countries. Since when has a disease ever been good for any society? So if you desire human sterilization why don't you go do us a favor and go jump off a bridge.

pTLcvsVfaa	Sunset because sunrise is just to darn early...|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Both pictures are lovely.  I really like the second picture better.  I have some pictures of beautiful sunsets, one in Jamaica, and one in Santa Barbara, CA, but I don't know how to put them on the internet.  The one I saw in California was the night before my 40th birthday.  It was the perfect ending for my thirties.  <br>  <br>  I enjoy sunrises, but I'm not usually up at that time.  I once saw a gorgeous sunset on a Caribbean cruise years ago.  I stayed up all night and was rewarded by the sunrise.  I won't ever forget it.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	I love the sunsets we get over Lake Michigan this is a picture i took and sent to channel 8 news post it ..I took it at a park called Northpark in Grand Haven Michigan.  on sept 8th of last year.|`|5RewiMkuaa	Pictures are beautiful.<br>  I really enjoy a nice sunset though.. <br>  Just the different colors to me seem more true than a sunrise.<br>  that sounds bad... they are BOTH equally amazing. i just love a sunset. :)|`|F4rD4HF0aa	both because i work days and night so it means it's almost time for bed

Also look for a cruise around your age... Since this is your first, I assume you are younger. Make sure you look at the "younger" cruise lines like Carnival and NCL.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|X6rFPI2laa	Jason gave you excellent information!  To that I would only add not to wait too long to book, because cruises over Christmas sell out very, very quickly!  (There aren't very many really good price breaks for those particular cruises, either.)|`|bNrrTyrQaa	I would say a 3 or 4 nighter on Royal Caribbean! Best cruise line you can get! I say this short of time becuz if u dont like the experience u woont dread it for a week! I love them but u might not. The ship i would recommend is a 4 night on navigator of the seas great ship! gives u the full experience.

GPznIhzMaa	You don't need a car to get around in San Francisco. They have one of the best public transit systems in the world. They have street/cable cars, buses, and trains. Their transit systems are called MUNI and BART. You can go on their sites to help you plan your trip in advance. The maps are also included in most guidebooks. Just like most transit systems, they stop running by midnight. In April, the temperature will still be pretty cool (it was in the 60s-70s when I was there in July), so dress in layers.|`|AA10758468	I think it's much more convenient to have a car but you get around with public transportation with careful planning. Using 511.org's Trip Planner is very useful. If you're using public transportation to get around make sure you avoid the temptation to pack too many activities into a day. It takes a long time to get around on public transportation.|`|nooAv4Leaa	It really depends on what part of SF you are planning on seeing. If its the downtown area you can get by with public transportation, but for certain places like Twin Peaks, Marin Headlands, Golden Gate Bridge...etc, a car would definitely be great.|`|LDLmKgG2aa	cabs can ge expensive so i would recommend bart it fun in my opinion and in some areas its cleaner, i think its better than a bus.<br>  good luck<br>  i hope it helped|`|QNXKoN05aa	Public transportation is the best and is really easy.

XOgvpDiZaa	I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but we do get all the channels on cable. We do have the UH football team, Sony Golf Open (or something like that, which is played on Oahu), and all of the other college sports teams. The North Shore is home to a few surfing competitions in November, as well as Maui.<br>  <br>  Sadly the Pro Bowl won't be played in Hawaii anymore (let's just wait till 2010).<br>  <br>  It is almst 5:30 PM here.|`|AA11015885	It is now 9:30AM in Hawaii.  We have all the sports channels that you do on the mainland, although sometimes times the games will be time delayed.|`|H7LZg5z0aa	Hawaii has a huge college following.  In fact, their team went to a bowl game just last year.  Sadly, they lost.  I would think that they air the sporting events in Hawaii.<br>  <br>  Hawaii is also the home of the NFL's Pro Bowl every year.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure but, I think it is either 7:30 AM or 6:30 AM in Hawaii right now.|`|7fow1Wngaa	OMG!!

The River Avon is still tidal in the city which is why it has a floating Harbour controlled by a set of locks built by the great Issy Brunel (though these were a replacement for the original)<br>  <br>  Not a "seaside" kind of place though, for that you need Weston super Mud, Cleavdon or the other coastal resorts|`|uRKZkBfjaa	Yes it is! The harbour is lovely but don't go to Severn Beach if you want the seaside. Come to Weston Super Mare but if you wait till 2010 we will have the new pier.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or come to T4 on the beach on July 19th!|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	Yes, it is.  But if you mean does it have a beach, then no.  For the nearest "seaside experience", as the other answer suggests, you should go to Weston-super-Mare.|`|vDp62eS1aa	Yes!

There's live music, crafts, food, and lots of people.  <a href="http://www.cheers2wine.com/San-Luis-Obispo-Farmers-Market.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheers2wine.com/San-Luis-Obis...</a><br>  <br>  The Boardwalk is usually fun in Santa Cruz.  Have breakfast downtown at Zacharys.  Walk across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco....or ride the ferry from downtown San Francisco to Sausilito or Angel Island.  Explore Golden Gate Park, ride a Cable Car.  <br>  <br>  Have a great trip.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Santa Cruz has one of the last of the old wooden roller coasters.  Worth a try if you like that kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Just north of San Luis Obispo is Hearst Castle. If you've never seen it you might consider a tour.  There are 5 tours, all pretty good.   San Luis Obispo itself is a college town and just full of young people, so I'd guess there were good hangouts there.  Also a very nice (and cheap) youth hostel).<br>  <br>  Monterey and Carmel are very pretty. Interesting little towns for shopping, having dinner, walking around.  Monterey has an incredible aquarium.<br>  <br>  San Francisco, well you have to ride the cable cars.  You might like to walk through Chinatown.  Everyone recommends Fisherman's Wharf but I think it's just touristy.  Still, if you haven't ever seen it you might like it.  I really like Fort Point too, an old Civil War era fort just under the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge.  But the Presidio and Marina District, at the north end of the city, has some nice parks, jogging paths, etc. with beautiful views of the bay, the bridge, etc.<br>  <br>  Just north of San Francisco is Marin Headlands, a park with great views of the city.  One of my favorite things there is Point Bonita Lighthouse.<br>  <br>  North of San Francisco the coast gets more rugged and more interesting.  There are campgrounds where you can camp near the beach, and walk down in the morning.  It gets really cold at night though.|`|6gbyhnXNaa	Driving along Highway 1 is a spectacular experience!  You could start in San Francisco & travel south, stopping at any of the following:  Moss Beach (the historic Moss Beach Distillery is an interesting lunch stop with a view), Half Moon Bay (cute little downtown), Santa Cruz (beach town, boardwalk, roller coaster), Moss Landing (year-round whale watching boat trip - see <a href="http://www.discovernortherncalifornia.com/whale-watching-trips-asea.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.discovernortherncalifornia.co...</a> ), Monterey (the Aquarium, the pier, Cannary Row, etc), 17 Mile Drive past Pebble Beach & on to Carmel-by-the-Sea (darling little town, well worth exploring), Point Lobos State Reserve (hiking coastal trails with marvelous views & often whale watching from shore),  and - last but not least - Big Sur (Molera Beach, the town of Big Sur, Pfeiffer SP, Julia Pfeiffer Burns SP - lots of beaches, hiking, awe-inspiring scenery, camping and so forth!)  All-in-all, an unbeatable road trip!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your visit, whatever you decide to do!!|`|8bb58fa4a42dc6a54ae5600a0d408c42aa	Monterey - Cannery Row has tons of great restaurants, Monterey Bay Aquarium is fun.<br>  Capitola - Margaritaville for lunch, nice shopping.

FvmrSeqRaa	As mentioned above, you won't find ANY flights to Europe for $400. Not one. But you can find some other nice places.<br>  <br>  If you go to Florida, you can visit the beautiful beaches (hot ladies) :D, and it is affordable. Obviously warm too, and you can travel by plane. <br>  <br>  You can also try California, near the beach, which will very likely be a bit more expensive, but once again, affordable if you can find the right deals. (Try Bookit.com)<br>  <br>  I flew to Cancun, Mexico from Chicago for about $350, and the Riviera Maya is the absolute most stunning place ever.<br>  <br>  I also liked Myrtle Beach, SC a lot, and it was very cheap, and the beaches were beautiful. Ironically, we arrived there June 11 also. <br>  <br>  If you are lucky, you can find packages (hotel + airfare) to San Juan, Puerto Rico, or Montego Bay, Jamaica for around $400, which is a pretty good deal, especially in this economy.<br>  <br>  Any other place that is warm is pretty much over $400. <br>  <br>  Have a great summer break, I'm sure you're going to have fun wherever you go.|`|AA11496012	You won't be able to fly to Europe in the summer for $400.  You can see how much it costs to fly to different cities in Florida on Southwest Airlines or Spirit Airlines.  Since these airlines do not partner with a travel website, you will have to go to the airline's own website and purchase a ticket.<br>  <br>  Texas and Arizona will also be warm to hot during the summer as well.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Flights to Paris from most US cities are more than $800/person, especially in the summer because that's their peak tourist season. For $400/person, you should stay within the continent. <br>  <br>  From Detroit, you can go to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego, Florida, Mexico, Dominican Republic, or Puerto Rico. (Jetblue has great rates for the last two destinations.)
s5n8vfgYaa	OMFG!!! Sorry this happened to you. Just be pacient, take a deep breath and relax, yes it's frustrating to have to put up with this kind of... sh*t where one lives, but it happens more and more often all over the world, and I'm not racist either, I have 2 nationalities and as a sign of respect to both, I learned both languages. Just that not eveybody cares.<br>  Just let what happened today to wash right off you, and next time you go to a pub, tell it as a joke.<br>  Have a nice day.|`|TKDi70uTaa	be carefull with taxi company's, they are always equipped for a bit of aggro and you could end up with a lot more than you bargained for. it seems to be the way things are nowadays. recently in a hardware store they had a girl there who could not speak the language and had no clue what i was asking for. pay the money, its not worth the aggro you may get but report them to your consumer association and the local council fraud office it seems they may be using illegal workers, they may send someone around to check out their staff. use another company in future as well.|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Let them try to call the police - its a civil matter! Take THEM to the small claims court for you having to pay at all! - they will lose and have to pay your costs - I know I would!!!!<br>  <br>  They need the business more than you need their custom - its a dog eat dog world and with customer service like that they won't be around long!|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Ignore the company - they are making threats they can't follow through. The police wouldn't be interested - this is a silly matter. No you were not being racist - you asked for an English speaking driver. You made no mention that the driver had to be of English nationality.<br>  <br>  Find a new taxi/cab firm to do business with.|`|AA11477931	let them call the police. explain to the police what happened. hopefully they will find that the taxi driver is most likely a illegal imagrant. and that the taxi firm is breaking the law.<br>  at the end of the day you have hired a driver to get you to your destination and if he fails that then he doesnt deserve to get paid|`|PY1glujMaa	Have you paid the ￡6.50 yet? Either way see someone who can give you advice but my understanding is that they have failed to deliver the service you required. They therefore should bear the additional cost. I would be surprised if the police act on that. On the racial prejudice thing make a written record of what you said to show any police who may show up if they try racial aggravation. Or report them for a racially aggravated crime, ie theft of ￡5.00.|`|qq5nceCXaa	In reality very little, just switch your choice of cab firms and use one that does mainly hackney rather than minicab work in the future.  The only power you have is customer power so name names to friends and colleagues.  If they try and pull it again mention the name of a big local firm and say you have contacts and you'll get them blacklisted, either than or say you work at the local paper, these people hate the publicity.  Write down the Number plate of the cab and ask to see the drivers licence number, there should be a badger inside the car with this on.<br>  <br>  The licensing for Minicabs is fairly shocking, but you could try your local council.  Won't get you far though as generally it is considered a civil matter.  As the distance was under 12 miles they tend not to get involved.  As with a restaurant meal you are not obliged to pay if the service was not what you ordered.  The problem with a cab is that you need to wait until you can get out and get all your stuff, so it's a bit difficult.<br>  <br>  I guess the lesson here is that you should have stuck with "this idiot doesn't have a clue where he's going I'm not paying" and not mentioned the language thing.  I know what you said wasn't racist, but you give them an opening and they'll take it.  <br>  <br>  Formally if you do want to complain you have to start by writing to them.  Keep a copy of the letter, stick to the facts and ask for a refund.  They will of course refuse.  You then contact the relevant licencing office at the council and get a complaint form.  The council will then contact the company and take up the issue.  It won't go anywhere, but the theory is you waste my time, I'll waste yours.  If you don't get any joy from that then try the small claims court.  They'll ignore it, but then you can get the baliffs in.  It really depends on how much energy you want to waste on this.
pTLcvsVfaa	Flight cost depends where you are coming from. But should be around 200-300$ give or take.<br>  <br>  Right now hotels are offering good deals. A 4 or 5 star hotel is typically near 300-500$ night in NYC. You could probably get a 4 star for around 200-250 these days.<br>  <br>  Its a pricey city. over 2-3 weeks you will spend thousands of dollars in NYC.|`|FplTPoAyaa	I have been to Manhattan twice.  The flight cost depends on where you live and the time of year you are traveling, but you could check on cheaptickets.com for a quote.  We stayed at a hotel near Times Square (can't recall the name) and it cost about $120 a night.  You would also need to factor in taxi fees (unless you are going to walk everywhere).  Have a fun trip !|`|4XTxSfR7aa	i went over valentines for 10 days and i got a really good deal, 850 quid for flight and hotel. but i think depending on when you want to go it will be bout 1500 for 2 weeks.|`|lZVz8SwBaa	i live in new york where do you want to go up state, NYC, or long island.

f1zTpzjKaa	I always hesitate in giving a definitive yes or no answer when people ask 'will I be covered if..'.<br>  <br>  However, I have never heard of an annual insurance policy that does not let family members travel separately and to different destinations.<br>  <br>  You should be able to get a travel insurance annual policy that covers this.<br>  <br>  Most insurers class Turkey as European.  Since you are going to need a worldwide policy for your Guatemalean trip (jealous by the way!) it may be cheaper to organise seperate policies anyway!<br>  <br>  Have fun!  By the way, check your bank accounts / credit cards - It is amazing how many of these providers give insurance cover.
fDW3aocaaa	sorry no. her C1 visa is classified as transit visa. if her cruise ship is docked in any US port, she is allowed to visit nearby places (like malls) but must be back again after a time period (usually less than 24 hrs.) determined by her captain.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	Customer service is unheard of in much of England, and, regrettably, rudeness to tourists is rife. But then the English are well known for their arrogance and "we-are-better-than-you" attitude.<br>  <br>  You will get far better treatment in either Wales or Scotland, where visitors are welcomed and afforded the courtesy that they richly deserve.|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	It's false. I work in customer service role and I am never rude to a customer and neither is any of my colleagues cos if anyone was that I know would no longer be in that role.|`|AA11349530	a lot depends on what you're expecting ... when I visited the States I found the customer service, with all the cheesy smiles and "have a nice day", very false ... we're not a tipping culture like the US so people serving customers don't feel the need to ingratiate themselves in the same way ... I don't often find people in shops, restaurants, hotels etc being rude to me, but then it depends what you consider rude ... I don't need someone clucking round me in the hope of a tip, I just need someone to possibly provide information and undertake whatever transaction that needs conducted (taking the money, serving the meal, whatever)|`|ay8tXLD2aa	I do find that customer service in England is poor, especially compared to Canada, the US, Australia, most places in Asia and continental Europe.  In shops it's pretty rare to have the staff speak to you, and I do find that if you ask where something is or if they have something, and the staff have to actually serve you, they tend to be a bit pissy about it.  <br>  <br>  But, I also find that most English people don't really notice, to be honest. Sort of that they hadn't really thought about it.  Perhaps because I've travelled and lived in many countries I have more to compare it to, I notice it more?  Not sure.  My in-laws who are English, have travelled extensively and they agree that generally customer service is lazy, and at the most indifferent.  Whereas my English friends who have never gone further than a package holiday to Benidorm all say that they don't really think about it.|`|qq5nceCXaa	Piss off , we're not rude!<br>  <br>  Actually the level of customer service can be shocking, though it has got better over the years.  If you want really bad service try Scandinavia, no one needs the tips so you can wait and wait and wait.<br>  <br>  Personally I can find the US too intrusive and annoying.  The plate's barely put in front of you and the guy's over asking "is everything to your liking"  I'm always tempted to say no, as they've asked a closed question, but then my British politeness gets in the way.<br>  <br>  That is an issue actually, only the British would apologise when someone else stands on their foot.  We never complain properly to the person, just seeth to our partners/Friends about how crap it is.  The British need a course in complaining properly, it's the class system thing.|`|rU4Z1ntmaa	I find customer service in England very good compared to Europe, one of the worst is the spainish and then the french or maybe they just don't like the english.|`|dB2BRGRAaa	True - Compared to US standards, customer services here are appalling, particularly in London and the South East.  <br>  <br>  I have travelled fairly extensively throughout the UK and Ireland on business and in the States as well.  The further you get from London, the nicer people tend to be, the pace of life is that little bit slower and people show a bit more courtesy.  The attitude in London tends to be that you should be grateful to be allowed to stay in that beautiful city.<br>  <br>  Unless you can afford to pay top dollar, expect badly maintained hotel rooms, poor standards of cleanliness and surly staff.  To be fair, people in the hotel industry tend to be treated as low-paid, unskilled workers especially at the budget end of the market.<br>  <br>  Don't be put off, I always use Tripadvisor before I stay anywhere and have rarely been disappointed.|`|XPqRthwraa	I am from London but live here in the USA. When I visit home every year I notice the lack of customer service and yes compared to american standards I am sorry to say that the english can be rude and don't even say thank you when they give you are change back or when you buy something. Very different from the States. I have thought that for years.|`|HHVZwcmwaa	My own experience is that customer service in England is pretty good.<br>  <br>  I do enjoy being acknowledged when I walk into a department in a department store, and I also enjoy having my own space until I want to ask questions.<br>  <br>  I also think that there are different levels of customer service, and if you have particular needs you should become familiar with the types of places that offer the service you need.<br>  <br>  If, for example, you want to be acknowledged when you walk into a department, seek out the department stores ~ their staff are all generally trained to acknowledge customers as soon as they walk into a department, and this is so that the customer knows that there is someone who is there when you need them.<br>  <br>  But on another level, if its intimacy and friendliness that you want, try the markets, such as in the East End and on The Kings Road.<br>  <br>  True, I have heard that there is a difference between serice in The UK, and places such as the USA, and some of the reasons why sales assistants here  in the UK are 'not out there' in terms of being overly friendly, is that we English tend to have a sense of reservation and in being so, we demand it of our own sales assistants.<br>  <br>  But my very best advice to you is that no matter where you shop, take the initiative yourself and catch the salesperson's eyes and be friendly to them, and that way you will get their best!<br>  <br>  Although this sounds stupid, if you 'play the dumb American' (I am asuming that you are from the Americas) and just ask for help, they'll swarm you with interest ~ I don't mean to sound patronising here, and just to illustrate this, when I am in France I always apologise for not speaking French and it always surprises them and because I have been apologetic, they always seem to swarm around me with niceness!<br>  <br>  Sometimes for a traveller, its all about figuring out how people will steriotype you on a bad day, and if you can get around the steriotype, you will always have a good day!|`|A0tWlG94aa	its false
f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	I would assume so. One will never get rich as a nurse, but it is a skilled occupation, so should pay well enough.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the other answerer, the state of medicine/medical science in the US is at a very high standard and should not be confused with the insurance access to health care situation in the states. The state of higher education is fine in the US, it's the lower schools that are a mess. It is best not to generalize about entire educational systems based on what one hears in the media. Medicine, anatomy and science do not change because you cross a border. Nursing standards are similar in most western countries. <br>  <br>  I assume that you would have to retake some courses or pass a certification test of some kind when moving country. An Irish nurse coming to the US would have to pass a certification test,the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) examination. You could look into working at the US embassy as a nurse - that is US soil even though it is in Ireland. I'd start looking at the Irish embassy website and go from there. If you have a 4yr Bachelor of Science Nursing degree and some practical experience I assume you would be fine with just re-certification.<br>  <br>  Nurses are always needed. If you are not dead set on Ireland, Australia always seems to be looking for nurses.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  The Irish education system is alot more advanced then the education system in America, even a 3rd level. You probably would need a degree under the Irish state to get a decent nursing job or any nursing job in hospitals that pay well.
WJpJ6CVpaa	Oakville Ontario is a great town.<br>  There is very little crime and they have the second highest rated highschool in Canada (Abbey Park), it is about a 20-30 minute drive from Toronto and has many jobs. I grew up there and it is a really nice, and living in Hamilton you have probably been there before. It's also one of the wealthiest towns in Canada, but there is also affordable housing. I definitely reccomend Oakville, it is probably the best town there is close to Toronto.

My 18 month old loved the water play areas in Epcot and the in the World Showcase got to spend some quality time with Tiger (UK), Mulan (China) and Aladin Moroccoo).Definitelyy check out allears.net for info on all four parks.|`|m2BCAdD3aa	YOU MUST GO TO animal kingdom!!! it was great they have lots of animals on the safari ( cool =! ) they have water rids ( cool =!) theyve got a new rollecrcoaster cllaed everest ( my 5 year old nepwhe went on it tough u nneda be at least 48 inches i think or something ) they have good food , they have lion king events, they have a place where you can get the characters autograph and whatever and  it`s just awosomeeeee|`|AA11449112	i would go to hollywood studios ... they have the beauty and beast show ... muppets, playhouse disney, and a fun parade.<br>  <br>  animal kingdom is fun too but its like going to a zoo.<br>  <br>  check this website out<br>  www.mousesavers.com|`|xSHRJw46aa	Something to consider is the Fantasmic show.  If it happens to be showing the day you are going, then you may want to go to the Studio.  It is a very cool show.|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	you should go to SeaWorld as well, if you are interested in seeing sea life animals, its very fun! you can watch shows, and feed some animals.|`|sF13O9Fmaa	Out of they 2 I would choose the studios, we go to Disney every year but we have only been to animal kingdom once because I wasnt impressed.|`|6SlpdRSbaa	Animal Kingdom is more Kid friendly!!!|`|UdtzY5ciaa	I love all four parks, but at that age, Animal Kingdom would be the better choice.|`|M7qU5MdOaa	Forget both of them...go to Seaworld...They'll love the shows, rides, marine life, and dolphin cove where you can feed the dolphins.  I have 3 kids and they remember Magic Kingdom the most and second was Seaworld.  And we've been to every park in Orlando.  Magic, Epcot, MGM, all are similar.  AK is just a zoo. If you're staying for a short period of time don't be fooled and try to go to all of disney's parks.  Magic Kingdom is a must but the rest is mediocre at best.  Enjoy.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Personally, I don't care much for Animal Kingdom.  It's just a zoo with a couple good rides, which is not what I am looking for at Disney.  However, if your kids are big animal lovers and an advanced zoo sounds like something they would like, then it may be a good choice.  Personally, I would go with Hollywood Studios.<br>  <br>  I would suggest going here: <a href="http://www.allearsnet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allearsnet.com</a><br>  They have lists of all the attractions at all the parks, so I would go through that and determine what your kids would like more.  Or buy a guidebook - Birnbaum's is good for kids (lots of pictures) and let them help decide!|`|JLayHNZCaa	AK and DHS are both great, although AK is a lot like a large zoo.  I would do DHS and go to a zoo near your home.<br>  <br>  <br>  tripadvisor.com search orlando, for free info on the area and attaractions.

Again, no clue what your budget is.  You can McDonald's your whole trip, and spend $150 for the 3-4 days, or go high end.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd say $1000 for the weekend would cover you nicely.
wqP8ACpBaa	NOTE: I have answered similar questions such as these at least three times in the past, so I decided to cut & paste the last answer I gave. You can see the link below & you can also try to browse thru the answers for that question, as I know you will be better informed.<br>  <br>  One tip, it would probably be raining a lot around that time of the year probably until September. And it does also rain in most parts  of the country up til November & the temperature kind of dips around that time up until February. But the country lies near the equator so the weather cannot really be anything but hot & humid.<br>  <br>  Have a nice visit! I will be there visiting as well in July.<br>  <br>  PASTED answer: Here is something that you have to keep in mind, whatever color you are, if you go to another country expect to be discriminated against. It is human nature.<br>  <br>  But in fairness to the Filipinos, they are probably among a handful who love Filipinos of mixed race parents. Most would probably adore you, make you a commercial or ramp model, make you a film/tv personality, hire you in their company, recruit you into their sports team, invite you to social gatherings, give priority to in restos, stores & shops etc. etc. In fact, we might be the ones being discrimated against as Filipinos just generally love foreigners.<br>  <br>  Another thing, most Fiipinos do not know the concept of discrimination or political correctness, so do not be surprised to hear words similar to the N word & if you do they mean no harm. Also as everybody else have said be prepared to be stared at. But those who do mean no disrespect. Be friendly, smile all the time & you would be fine.|`|OmHC6d3Jaa	There is a little racism of a  sort that is a little different than American-style racism.  Don't worry it is nothing of a violent nature like it was/is sometimes in the US and Europe--but it is grievously annoying.<br>  <br>  However, it will more along the lines of insensitive and rude comments made in your presence or behind it alluding to your race physical attributes, often said in a ridiculing tone.  <br>  <br>  You see, some pinoys continue to ascribe to archaic precepts of racial heirarchies or castes embedded upon them by their former colonizers; wherein caucasians are considered superior, followed by mestizas (mixed white with another race), then by fairskinned asians, then by darker asians, then by blacks and finally by darkskinned indigenous tribespeople such as Aetas.  The irony of it all is that most pinoys fit into the darkskinned asians category--so it is a little self-defeating. <br>  <br>  It is ingrained into the culture.  Some of us have progressed beyond that backwards mentality from having sustained exposure to foreign cultures and better education but don't be surprised if you encounter otherwise.|`|4e18c82089d9eecf334053f6edf2d156aa	absolutely. if you are not a filipino you will be expected to pay more for everything. also, if you are involved in any traffic incident while driving you are automatically at fault.<br>  <br>  there won't be racism based on being black. it will be based on not being filipino.|`|sJqNDYVkaa	At this day and age, I think most Filipinos are already used to nationalities of different colors.

All you have to do is just be friendly and you'll have the same response. Respect and you'll be respected. Be nice and you'll be treated like a queen.

Filipinos like to ogle at someone different than they; just be aware that that initial reaction is not racism or bigotry.  It is curiosity.  If you display a comfortable and friendly demeanor, Filipinos respond immediately.  We are among the friendliest people on earth, to begin with.<br>  <br>  Please relax and enjoy your stay, with friends I suppose.  Respect our economic and cultural differences, especially economic.  But exercise great care which places to visit.  This advice is true for all tourists.|`|vbTG3a4Zaa	ehhh <br>  well you'll defenitely get a stare,its unusual for us even though some Filipinos have darker skin

Both countries have nursing shortages by the sounds of it.<br>  I live in Aus and we definately have nursing shortages!<br>  I guess what you need to do is fnd out a bit about how you'd get over there and how long for, if you can get a working visa. Because you don't want to make your mind up and have your heart set on it and be disappointed.<br>  See if the skills taught by your college are applicable to Australian hospitals, talk to your college about it.<br>  It's a great opportunity and don't believe all you hear about it being hot all the time.. it's definately not. everywhere is different, it's a massive country so we get heat, sure but we also get snow and below freezing temps!<br>  I know you'd probably find it quite easy to get work, the pay is good, hours are not so good, as long as, like I said your skills are what's required in Australian hospitals.<br>  <br>  You really need to find out some info about it all, firstly I'd go to the student career centre at your school or just anyone that may be able to help. Probably look and see if there's a program that can get you over here to work. As far as where you live, I suggest if you live in a really cold area you won't want to go somewhere like darwin, it might be a bit of a shock to the system, then again, if you HATE the cold, I'd stay away from Tassie and Victoria areas because whilst they do have very hot weather in summer, it's deathly cold in winter.<br>  <br>  So yeah, it really requires a bit of research but if you just wanted my opinion I'd say YES! go for it, don't stay in USA just cos they need nurses, live your life, have fun! I'm training to be a nurse and whilst our hospital does have nursing shortages I fully intend on travelling and seeing the world!<br>  <br>  good luck with nursing and the future, maybe I'll pass you in a hospital in Australia one day!|`|tBsMH9kGaa	First of all that's a good idea to be a nurse. That's what I wanna be when I grow up. Second I think you should stay here, because nurses are needed much here in the United States, I don't know if Australia needs nurses as much. you'll have to do some research.<br>  <br>  But if you really want to go for it. <br>  <br>  Best regards!|`|d4eS4sHaaa	you should visit australia 1st and try it out and see for yourself!<br>  its a great opportunity!

Theres plenty of people who need nursing in the USA lol<br>  <br>  Do your research before you make any decisions.|`|ugsUiYO6aa	NO!! you stay on ur feet for 12 hours and you will end up working there for 22 years like my grandma and when you go home you will say "OH LORD HAVE MERSEY, i never thought my life would be like this!!"|`|Ul9GDumUaa	do what is best for you don't care what other think of you|`|mQNyNGPsaa	I think the biggest medical center is in Houston (I'm not 100% sure on this). You might want to go there|`|5WLhNzKJaa	go for it|`|WHoxStwEaa	YES!! I know Dr. Ashis Brahma and he is such an amazing guy! he has the most compassion for the people in Africa! He is a volunteer Dr. for people who cannot afford medical services! I want to be a Dr. in a foreign country! These people have nothing and they are the happiest people on earth.. we can really learn alot from them. I think it would be an amazing experience to work in Australlia. It would make you so much more grateful for everything you have. It makes life so much better when you are helping people in need. I appreciate your desire to serve others. you must have a big hear! God Bless!|`|1qwoZOOnaa	NO I DONT THINK SO CAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO MOVE TO A FOREIGN COUNYTRYhave been everyehere in Australia (and i mean everywhere, including the places you dont hear about) and there are good reasons to move and bad reasons to move here.<br>  <br>  Pros<br>  - Rated extremelly high in the list for standards of living. Few contries rate higher. Norway is the only consistent country to be higher.<br>  - Compared to other first world countries has a very healthy environment, although this has dimished in Sydney and Melbourne.<br>  - Well paid jobs. Jobs are one of the hihgest earnings in the world, people are generally paid very evenly, high paid jobs are usually related to the mining sector. Compared to the US, management are paid lower salaries and a focus on worker satisfaction has been prominent in Aussie history. Australian employers often make little distinction between foreigners and locals in employment except on the issue of stability.<br>  - Technology. Australia keeps up in technology, and this is encouraged by the government. This is shown also through our excellent scientific achievements.<br>  - Healthcare. The govenment is very encouraging with medicine and healthcare. Recent developments in healthcare show that while good, government is spending less in this area.<br>  - Education. Australia rules in this area, although due to less funding over the past 15 years public education system is deteriorating, and universities fund themselves mainly through international students. (PS: i am a highschool teacher)<br>  - Weather. Very nice for the beach. Beaches in cities are generally clean and nice to go to. Beache sfurther from cities are even nicer.<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  - Drought. Due to drought in past 5 - 10 years due to climate change then Australian growers are suffering, resulting in a probable increase in produce prices.<br>  - Hot. Australia is very hot country, it is common for the temperature to be over 40 degrees celcius during feburary.<br>  - Racism. While Australia is on the surface very multicultural, there is the usual underlying racism. Most of this is due to foreigners taking our jobs (which they probably do better anyway).<br>  - Housing shortage. There is a housing shortage in australia due to people wanting to live in large houses rather than apartments, this makes rent reasonably high if you like living in the city.<br>  - Communication. Internet is slightly slow when communicating to america due to the distance, communication to asia is good though.<br>  - Car use is extremelly high, although australians generally seek better fuel economy due to large distances they travel.<br>  <br>  WHERE TO MOVE TO:<br>  <br>  Sydney: very expensive to live in, and very busy in comparison. most polluted city. Also oldest (200yrs). Diverse both culturally and economically.<br>  <br>  Melbourne: reasonably cheap for an economic centre. this is a nice city to live in (my parents live there) a very diverse population from all walks of life, especially the artistic.<br>  <br>  Adelaide: A highly religious city, but very beautiful. Unfortuantly economically dry.<br>  <br>  Perth: (where i live): Very beautiful, healthy city, and very large for its small population (1.7mill, 100km long) Has a very bad housing shortage and expensive rent due to emmigration for other cities such as melbourne and sydney. Centre of the mining industry in Australia.<br>  <br>  Darwin: Hottest city, also very small. Is in tropics in far north. Very small, is mainly sustained by military and aboriginal population. beautiful australian countryside a day away along any road.<br>  <br>  Brisbane: THe tropical city, where retirees, and people looking for a nice climate go to too. The city is growing more than any other. much like perth but closer to sydney and melbourne. Main boom comes from tourism and recent economic growth.<br>  <br>  Canberra: political centre. Very nice, cool town. Relaxing. Very little point living there unless you are attached to political or military. but it is still very nice.<br>  <br>  Country: Australia is very varied. Most of Australians live in the cities, and towns are distributed by eachother from between 50km (eastern coastline) to 1000km (Western Deserts) depending on where you are.<br>  Despite this there are some beautiful places and many places are flourishing in tourism. Economic growth is limited to Centres such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Pe|`|RMzjZfM9aa	Hell Yes.  Your lucky as a nurse, you could get a job pretty much anywhere in the world.  <br>  <br>  Take the opportunity and go to Australia, you would be the envy of many people.

W5VqTPQRaa	Argentina is a great place to live, especially for a long time.  Some people like to claim that Buenos Aires is a dangerous place, but it is actually a very international city and very welcoming to foreigners.  It is certainly much safer than nearby Rio.  Outside BA, in places like Bariloche and Ushuaia, there is litereally no reason to be afraid.  All (ok, most) Argentines are very nice people, and get very excited to meet people from other countries.<br>  <br>  Besides all of that, there is so much to do there!  There is great art, history, parks, music and nightclubs that stay open all night (and well into the next day).  I have nothing against Bolivia, it is a nice place to go, but if you are looking for a great mixture of Safety and Fun, head to Argentina.<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful!|`|o4IcmkwLaa	Argentina, hands down. Bolivia has some beautiful areas, the level of crime is higher there, and you are more likely run into problems as a volunteer there.|`|IpQY6rVMaa	Argentina would be safer i think.|`|AA11473654	hi I would say Argentina also. I did an internship in Bolivia this past January and almost died.I had to be hospitalized for a week. I got travelers salmonella (even though I only ate in 4 star hotels) also I almost got a heart attack because of the altitude. I think if u never been there before it is a serious health risk. Bolivia is a beautiful place though regardless.

OZWJi4Jgaa	Joe,    It is a matter of fact that the best Costa Rica coffee is exported - so often the local coffee does not live up to the Costa Rica name.    During my years of traveling to Costa Rica I always purchased premium, fresh roasted coffee at a great shop in San Jose's Mercado Central, located between avenidas Central and 1 and calles 6 and 8.  I would get the coffee packaged in souvenir burlap bags as great gifts for friends and family.    Once I moved to Costa Rica and was only interested in buying good economical coffee for my home I had the same question you have.    The answer: drink what the locals drink and what many restaurants serve, a coffee brand called "1820".    1820 coffee is available in most stores (ie: Pali, Mas X Menos, Hipermas, Auto Mercado, Jumbo, local mini supers, etc.), is a good blend and is the best coffee for your money.|`|h3SvEWJcaa	Personally my favorite local brand is "Triangulo de Oro" since its picked from the top-three coffee spots (Naranjo, Tres Rios, Tarrazu). When feeling fancy I think Cafe Britt's flavored coffee is delicious, specially Mocca.|`|UYD7w8gCaa	My preferences are:  Cafe Rey Traditional  Cafe Britt (red packaging)  Cafe 1820
0rpS2b97aa	YOu need to make sure that you understand what type of reservation that you are making.  Some rates are only available if you prepay.  Some rates take the credit card to guarantee only and a method of payment is asked for at check in.  It will depend on the type of rate and the hotel brand.  Ultimately, the hotel can't tell if the card is prepaid.  It would only be a problem if you did not have enough funds to cover the charges.|`|wNbFSw46aa	Yes you can, but keep in mind that some Hotels do want an actual credit card With a name or they might required a cash deposit, so just keep that in mind. and must be 18+ in some hotels to rent a room.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	Yes--that's one reason why many hotels will "block" the cost of the hotel room on your credit card, to ensure that it is there when they go to collect it.     So, if you have a prepaid credit card with $1,000 on it, and the hotel reservation is for $600, they will place a block of $600 on your credit card, meaning you only have $400 to spend on everything else.|`|tPG0m6h7aa	YES YOU CAN|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Sure..    Just remember that the hotel is going to put a block on some of your funds as a form of deposit.     My advice is to call the hotel and find out what kind of hold they are going to put on the card.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	if you have to ask that question. you have no business going on vac and staying in a hotel. stay home get a second job pay off your bills|`|LMDCm6kuaa	Yep, you can!    Just make sure that there is enough money on the card to cover all of the expenses, and you will be absolutely fine.

They are more Pacific Islander with mixture of Spanish heritage.
3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	I live in Surigao City, in Mindanao. the first time i was in cebu and Manila i also noticed the people were taller. I think alot has to do with better nutrition. Also, there are alot more mixed race people in cebu and manila then the provinces. And they tend to be taller also. I would say the average person in the provinces is several inches shorter then Manila or cebu. I'm 5'9" and in my home town i am tall, but in manila, just average.|`|Oj1eYTyBaa	That's because the health there is improving. That way the Filipino people are getting healthier and more in shape. My mom is the shortest in our family (which by the way, we are Filipino) and she's 5'2... But my grandpa was 6'1 and my grandma was 5'10. Then my two aunts are around 5'8 and 5'4. And my uncle is 6'1 too. So health and fitness is improving, but remember that genes in the family effect their height as well. =]|`|Gn0kJXHpaa	Better nutrition & genes = larger people.  Check with some of your parents or grandparents.  I hope you were not laughing at the people here as that is rude  Height  means nothing - just step in the ring with Manny for a few minutes. ha ha|`|Nn4To7XKaa	Yes, due to improving health services, diet and formulated products available. I'm 5'10" and I met a girl that is 6'2". At first I was shocked because she was taller and bigger than I am. Then the rest is history. We never had much time to spend together (sigh..).|`|BC9nPXG7aa	i hope so cuz i need to get taller|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Here's the short and simple answer:    Filipinos tend to be taller than other Asians because:  1) Of the relatively large input of Pacific Islander genes into the Philippines - particularly the taller Micronesian and Polynesian type.    2) Of the relatively large Caucasian admixture in the Philippines than in any other Asian country.    3) Of the information dissemination conducted in the Philippines through mass media particularly television.    4) Of the natural predisposition of Filipinos to drink milk (a value which started from the American colonization of the islands on 1898-1945).|`|wqP8ACpBaa	I remember in my time, the average height of the Filipino male used to be 5'5". But that does not mean that there are very few Filipinos taller than that.  I was already 5'9" back in the early 1980s & many of my friends & classmates were taller than me, 5'10' to 6'1". Today the average height would most probably be higher than 5'5" & I wouldn't be surprised to see six footers everywhere. And you are right Asians are getting taller.|`|SoIvM1NHaa	huh? all the asians I know are pretty tiny?|`|Xe9Qb8pLaa	Wow.  Were not asians. Pacific islanders.  And were not all short...  I bet you got a punch in a face when you got there. Ha. Suprised much?|`|3wo5za57aa	people in general are getting taller because of improved health and diet.  There are alot of tall Asians though so the fact that you saw tall Filipinos shouldn't be surpising.....|`|tVmnGGuvaa	well you know filiphinos arent as asian as you think they are..they're more of an asian/latino mix and were never small..you're probably thinking about the chinese/japanese/viet/korean people|`|OmHC6d3Jaa	Have you ever heard of Yao Ming, he's the shortest guy on our block.

wKZlrJAjaa	yes Canada is a very nice place to live and edmonton is nice part to live in!    in winter it goes from 0 to negative 27 degrees Celsius.  in the winter more like 10 to plus 29 degrees Celsius  I live in Canada near edmonton :D|`|e8ef425b76319bea89cafc0909c72a9daa	they have that huge mall.  its amazing, but its wayyyy too cold there.|`|CM13OZsjaa	I live in south Minnesota, and i love the summers here, but the winters are just plain cold. Yes, it is cool looking when it snow's but here in Minnesota it gets in the negatives. like one day in January or February it could be -5, or if its really bad -20 or worse, but thats the negative side of things. Otherwise summer spring and fall are great. I think some parts of Canada would be a Decent place to live. As you probably know things in canada are more expensive, but thats the scoop.|`|ivIQl6Awaa	dude, move to Banff.  It's in the mountains, about 4 hrs south of Edmonton.  It's a fairly small ski town (about 8000 people) and it's Awesome!!!  It's great for travelling to, and you can make trips to Vancouver, Whistler, Edmonton etc. from here.  The reason I think it's better is because it is totally geared to travellers.  It's pretty cold in Winter, and never really gets super hot.  but you get used to it.  You should read up about it in a travel book and see if it's for you.  The only negative is that there are heaps of kiwis and aussies here all the time...I know I have some kiwi friends who say that they wanted to go somewhere different, and then it;s like half of NZ is here already!!!  I don't think anything is wrong with Edmonton, but it's not super nice or fun or really anything but an ordinary city.  I like to go there, but I wouldn't want to travel there or live there for a year or anything.  See you soon!!!    PS if you wanna come to canada, you'll have to deal with the cold...it's potential to be -25 or 30 ALL OVER CANADA...you can't escape it!!!  This year is proof!  get a good winter outfit, LOL!!    Oh yah, and if you are a rugga you can join our rugby club...if you want!!!|`|5ANrqTtlaa	of course i LOVE canda it very multicultural and has great weather(most times) just great !!!!!!!!|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I'm in Ontario, but have been to Edmonton many times...way cold in the winter..they can get to 40 below there, but is an ok city..I like Calgary better.|`|xK75gTz9aa	they have the west edmonton mall!   the coldest it can ever is get is like -30 celcius degress|`|NnXKDZIsaa	Never been to Alberta, but live in Ontario. The winters are very cold, but with the proper outdoor clothing, you'll survive just fine. Canada is very beautiful! I'd recommend it :)|`|R5LuKSUXaa	Its cold in the winter especially in the prairies.  In the summer time is gets hot hot hot.  Do you mean mid 20s 30s in Farenheit or Celsius?  It can get up to 100F or 30+ Celsius.  Edmonton is BORING!! And ugly.  I lived in edmonton for a year and it was FREEZING in the winter. WHen i was there is was minus 45 for liek a month straight. The only thing to do there is get drunk, party, go to west edmonton mall.  Pretty damn boring.

z4Yrn96Paa	Most Russians are very loyal to tradition and in Russia it is common to name children after the Russian Orthodox patron saint whose name is celebrated on or near the day when the baby is born. That is the overwhelming tradition. The baby's middle name comes from the father and brothers in a family can have the same middle name since the middle names' purpose is to point to the father.    Here is a list of names you might wish to look over: http://masterrussian.com/aa031701a.shtml for boys and then http://masterrussian.com/aa031001a.shtml for girls.|`|UHkjNWVWaa	Liam is weird but you could name him nikolai, and  others can call him nick.    -The Toe|`|0GN8kkQYaa	Dolph.|`|yvWJm3lGaa	Anthony/Anton  Andre pronounced ahn dray  Nicholas/Nikolai nickname niko  Maxim  Kyril  Alexei  Ruslan pronounced roo slun  Micheal/mikhail  Boris  Yuriy  Leon    Sergey/ nickname serge/sergie|`|BWxSSADaaa	Yeah, the girl names are easy, aren't they?  :-)    My mom was in the same position, my dad is Indian.  She wanted to give my sister and I names that reflected our Indian heritage, but that wouldn't cause us to get made fun of in American school (poor Indian kids named "Mehboob", etc.)    So, to my American ears, these are some names that sound not "strange":  Maksim, Roman, Alexei, Andrei, Stefan/Stepan, Oleg, Artur, Robert (swear, it can be Russian, my Russian BF's brother is named this, it's just pronounced slightly differently), Denis, Mikhail, Anton, Pyotr, Nikolai, Filip, Abram, Albert, Viktor, Grigory, David, Danil    Some of those are indistinguishable from names we hear often in America, but when pronounced it's slightly different.  Here's a website with some pronunciation guidance: http://masterrussian.com/aa031701a.shtml    I have to admit, some of those may not sound foreign to me because I've gotten used to hearing a lot of Russian every day.  Try the list on any American friends you have, and the ones they like show to your husband.  Come to a compromise, it's not worth fighting over.  Good Luck!  :-)    PS: hate to let you down, but I also like all of those names so much better than Liam or Hayden!  Those names to me seem very trendy, but there's something about traditional Russian male names that seems to me strong and masculine and interesting.|`|ABZfW82eaa	Oleg  Excellent, strong name.   Occurs from Scandinavia.    Maxim  Occurs from the Latin word "Greatest".    Alexey  Occurs from an Ancient Greek word to "defend".

This added fee is a great example of "sticky prices" - meaning they go up quickly but don't come down quickly.  Competition among airlines may eventually cause an airline to drop the fee in an effort to lure more customers, but I don't see this happening any time soon.
GWNMs37laa	They're all lovely, but Devon has the edge, it has amazing beaches, beautiful lush green hills and countryside and fab cities especially Exeter (but i'm a bit biased, cause i live there)...|`|649bdae33e28a2743eca2eddc77f97b8aa	Oi - what about Wiltshire?|`|OQu1JikAaa	Devon, Somerset and Cornwall are full of attractions that suits to every kind of human nature. Personally I like Devon more out of these three. Buckland Abbey, Canonteign Falls, Castle Drogo, Clovelly, Cobbaton Collection and Coldharbour Mill make your stay a lifetime memory. If you want to enjoy luxury comforts and treatment during your trip, you may book your accommodation and trip online also well in advance through .|`|3ZaLrs6maa	Cornwall and Devon equals.:D|`|QoVL5cDHaa	Devon. It is the largest of the counties, and has such diverse aspects, from the towering cliffs of North Devon to the mild, almost semi-tropical English Riviera of Torbay, the wild stark beauty of Dartmoor and Exmoor, the meandering rivers in the valleys, rolling green hills, and thatched cottages. Country lanes are so picturesque, and can be isolated. You can see the stars at night - there is no light pollution. The air is fresh and bracing.  We have two Cathedrals, in Exeter and Plymouth, many castles and stately homes, and much history, especially from the Navy and seafarers like Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake.  We have ferries to France and Spain from Plymouth, easy access to quaint places in Cornwall, and the dual carriageway/motorway if we need to "emigrate" upcountry.

Jn7bt3JTaa	Excalibur is a really good time. Thunder From Down Under is there. I went to see them for my dirty 30. GREAT time. They don't get fully nude and you do not tip. There are several sets. There is a bar in the actual theater. Excalibur has nice restaraunts an tables and I love the breakfast buffet. It neighbors the Luxor and New York, New York. If you want to explore other hotels in walking distance.       Order a Pina colada if you don;t want to taste any alcohol.          See the link I posted.|`|jlrb0ZXoaa	easy. yard o'margarita. look for buffets. you can get all you can eat buffets for less than $10, some have crab legs if youre into that.|`|lys5kB9Daa	Hey! i'm going there in a few weeks for my 24th bday yaay to us!  did you book your hotel yet? cuz i found really good discounts on hotelclub.net my mom is a travel agent and i called her and even she couldnt get prices that cheap. i'm not trying to advertise for them or anything im just telling you i used them and they are cheap lol    i'm not sure about clubs or shows because i havent been there since i was 12 but for drinks i dont like strong stuff either. i can taste alcohol in any drink and most people cant. so i like midori sours they are bright green and taste like jolly ranchers! sex on the beach is pretty good its like fruity but some can be strong tasting. shots of kamakazee are really yummy. i would suggest drinking some stuff like mikes hard lemonade or twisted tea in your hotel room before you go to the bar and you'll be buzzed and spend way less :)  have fun, i know i will lol|`|OuTlT8f6aa	Some places that are good if you want to spot celebrities are Tao at the venetian and LAX which are both night clubs.   I wasnt 21 when I went so I couldnt go there but they are supposed to be good.  For during the day you should go to the outlet mall which you can get the bus to as it has loads of clothes at discount prices (levis,vans,skechers,etc)  Also worth a look is the view for the top of the stratosphere.  Freemont street has an awesome light show at night.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Well you can pretty much do anything you want. 21 is a good age to gamble but with birthdays....maybe there are many places where you can celebrate it. Usually I don't think inside the Casino would be the best. In the past I never seen a birthday celebration inside a Casino, but there might be birthday bashes, but that's different story.|`|KGgPtU8zaa	Yes there are tons of places NOT to go if you are on a budget. Basically all of the BIG hotel/casinos are going to charge you $7 for a beer or like $8 for a mixed drink. That is of course unless you are gambling there, then you may be able to score some free ones.     But if you are not planning on pissing all of your $ away gambling but still wanna party and drink then I have a few suggestions for you.  On the Strip  - O'Sheas, Bills & Slots of Fun all have cheap drinks. Bills has 99 cent margaritas that are YUMMY although they are a little bit strong. The daquiris & margaritas at Slots of Fun are yummy and dont taste strong and they are $1.25 and BIG. HAha. That place rocks    But if you want a really fun atmosphere without spending a ton of $$ then DEFINATELY go down to Freemont Street. Take the Deuce Bus to get there and back. Its $5 for a day pass and you can pick it up at any casino. It makes tons of stops.   Downtown is so fun and has a huge ligtshow every hour!! The food downtown is cheap. I recommend the 99 cent shrimp cocktail at the Golden Gate. Also you can get beers and margaritas, daquiris for 99 cents pretty much everywhere down there.   My husband and I had a blast at "Mermaids" on Freemont Street. We were playing the nickel slots and got served free drinks every 10 minutes!! What a deal!!!!    Theres no reason to pay an arm and a leg for anything in Vegas because there are so many places to choose from. Dont get suckered into those expensive places|`|BBNUWugUaa	OMG Vegas is so fun. You will have a blast doing anything! I know of this great site that can help you plan your Vegas vacation from where to go what to do and even some places to eat. Check it out!   http://www.VegasMadeEasy.com    Have a blast in Vegas baby!|`|OQu1JikAaa	Hard Rock, The Palms, Fantasy Suites, Pure at Caesars Palace etc are the places that seem ideal for your preferences. Besides these, there are many other places. So, all depend upon the budget and how you plan.|`|06jHpgRDaa	cool!!! thats where im going wen its my 21st bday!!!   eating places:margarita ville,(jimmy buffets) def have a pizza in caesars palace  drinks: mandalay place wen u walk down the hall, type thing, u will see all kinds of stores, and if u keep going, u will see places 2 get drinks blended, & if u keep going down the hall, u will go right in 2 luxor & excalibur w/out even going outside!! cool huh? there is also in mandalay bay, the main hotel, if u see a resturant called red white and blue, dont eat there, its sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hope i helped!!!!!!!!!|`|fMBREYmNaa	try rain, rain is the sickest|`|700c94a067fa40af4b92ab4a9fe433f5aa	Well dear, Happy 21st!  I can't think of a better place in the world to turn 21!  Are you going with just friends, or family too?  I always promised my son that we would take him to Vegas for his 21st birthday and I kept my promise...Both myself and his dad went, his sister and her boyfriend went, and my son and his girlfriend went...I am not old fashioned...and he and his girlfriend had their own room, as did the rest of of us!  We stayed downtown at the Lady Luck, (now closed) and we flew in the day before his birthday!  We saw all the sights, and ate 2 or 3 times before Midnight, went to the Strip, saw all the free shows, rode the Tram, exhausted ourselves by 11pm..all went back toFremont street and to our rooms to relax, and come midnight....we all hit the Casino(s) separately! What a trip!  What a Blast!  He partied with his girlfriend and sister and her boyfriend...Mom and Dad gambled and turned him loose....His sister rented a cab, and to this day I don't know where all they went, but things come out now and then....and to this day he will tell you that his 21st birthday was great!  (we did the cake and Ice Cream thing the day before we went to Vegas!)  He and his new girlfriend are still friends with his ex girlfriend and her new boyfriend, and they were all here for Christmas!  I tell everyone I know that Vegas is the best place in the world to let go of your babies when they hit 21!  I'd have been worried sick if he had hit all the bars at home!  But there, Taxi's are cheap, You can drink and party and Gamble....My suggestion is for you to stay downtown and visit the Strip...The cost of a Taxi is the price difference of a night on the strip in a hotel versus a room downtown!  There are numerous Casino's Downtown, and you will only be about 5 to 10 minutes from your room from any of them!  Have a Wonderful Birthday!
5AbCtkWFaa	Well, considering he spent much of his adult life in Chicago, which gets far nastier than this, he probably felt we were overreacting.  I'm sure he's gotten used to walking in snowy and icy conditions, but it happens rarely in DC, so we have not.  Add to that the transience of DC and that some people are from warmer climes, and you have a whole bunch of people who have no idea how to deal with the stuff.    And he's not going to outlaw snow days.  Chill.|`|4i59X44Laa	Sorry, but I used what you call quotes, and I could find nothing.  Maybe it was a capsule instead of a quote. Maybe it was just something you thought you saw or heard. Maybe it is something you dreamed up for a question.|`|mlAW436Daa	I hope Obama outlaws snow.|`|cRKPmVlvaa	When I started watching the interview halfway in I thought he was going to outlaw snowdays for DC, VA, and MD|`|ZTwZJjj7aa	He may think we're wimps in the Washington area, but over 20 people have died from the treacherous icy conditions. Are they wimps? And does he really want to take chances with children? Snow days are built in to the school system, as our breaks are shorter to account for winter weather. A few snow days can't hurt anyone and we are entitled to them. If Obama wants to be a joy kill and take away our snow days, how cool can he be? He sounds more like a bully than a president.  And doesn't he have more important things to deal with? Our nation has plenty of issues that need to be addressed, and attacking our way of life isn't one of them. Please don't take away our snow days President Obama- that's like canceling Christmas.|`|CKRtwea6aa	The snow removal teams and trucks and supplies are nothing in the DC Metro area as compared to cities like Chicago or Buffalo. Cities that are heavily hit by winter snow have the means and manpower to perform move tremendous amounts of snowfall in a short period of time. As well all know the DC metro area does not. It would be foolish to buy expensive equipment that would just sit and not be used most of the year. And to hire extra drivers for part time work that are not properly trained is extremely dangerous. Snow days are unfortunately are necessary for this region and we cannot get around it. Yeah, DC might be wimps when it come to snow/ice, but we try to stay at home where it's safe!

cjCjnwxEaa	is there a  different ??|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	You're right...one is a City, and the other is a Country...and yes, I know that that is a snide remark. It was supposed to be.    1) This kind of bile is best vented elsewhere...maybe in a personal blog?  2) Your question...such as it is...is in Violation of Community Standards...namely, it isn't a question.    I understand the frustration..and sympathise. We all have our own "Red Necks" to deal with, and "Stupid" signs to pass out (Thank you Jeff Foxworthy and Bill Engval!).    Good Luck, and an Even Temper, eh?|`|zAg4YpIraa	You are from China though so you can't say you aren't from China.. It's like someone from Hawaii saying that aren't from America it just doesn't work.. I understand what you are saying though.|`|nfu6LiVXaa	So you're upset because people mistaken you as a Mainland Chinese? Or you upset because people think Hong Kong is China?    Hong Kong IS part of China, so you can't blame them for thinking Hong Kong is China. Hawaii and New York are completely different, too. People eat different food, have different history and cultural background, etc. But you don't see a Pacific Islander in Hawaii getting all upset when people say "oh USA? I've been to New York before!"     So, I am guessing you're upset because people think all Chinese are from China and you don't want people to think that you're from China? What's wrong with being from China? You ashamed of China? Let me guess, you have British passport (a BNO) and because of that you think you're better than other Chinese from China?
Ut7UThzyaa	Florence with Rome are the town where in relay have born the history of Italy.  for that reason in all the school of italy everybody study the yours history.  and also are visited of the student from the school of all Italy|`|HvI2WhDraa	I'm not from Florence, but from Trento, which is a smaller town up in Northern Italy...  and yes, we do study the history of our towns in pretty much every elementary school in Italy. A kid from Florence learns about Florence, a kid from Milan, learns about Milan, a kid from trento, learns about Trento.  We also take a lot of field trips during elementary school, middle school and high school, we go to different cities in Italy and in Europe and we learn about the history of that town/city/region
4aAhEK9daa	Hmm I don't know South but I know a few on the Eastside and North.    Kelsey Creek Farm in Bellevue - http://www.lilaguide.com/reviews/kelsey-...    Animal Farm at Forest Park in Everett - http://www.everettwa.org/default.aspx?ID...    Farrel McWhirter Park in Redmond also has a small farm - http://www.redmond.gov/insidecityhall/pa...    Note, though, that most of the farms are only open in the summer/fall for visitors.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i completely agree with platters... the Olympic Game Farm in Sequim is soooo fun. we took our 3 year old nephew last April and he had such a great time. you get to drive around the farm in your car and see all these spectacular animals. they have a petting zoo area there too where they can walk into a fenced area with animals and pet them. when our daughter gets older we'll be taking her there.|`|uKWcgLLoaa	Most incredible experience available: Olympic Game Farm in Sequim. Not cows and pigs, but bears, zebras, buffalo, lions, tigers, llamas--and some animals used in Disney movies like Gentle Ben!! You drive through, feed them from your car. They surround your car (and some even stick their heads inside, like the zebras and llamas!) It's lots of fun, a ton of hearty laughs for everyone. Prepare for your car to be slobbered upon.     It's just 90 minutes from the Edmonds ferry landing--30 minutes on the ferry and 60 minutes of driving.
tFoSy2YRaa	Tip - the tube closes at about 1am, so you need to take taxis or night buses afterwards. If you're taking a taxi make sure its registered and safe.    Anyway...the area around covent garden would be great for 2 girls your age, you can shop and see a show, then have dinner, then go to a bar, then go clubbing. I went to Los Locos last week and had a blast - its quite small but very fun.  Some other random clubs - Tiger Tiger and Ononan are both quite central, try to get on a guestlist or something because they get very busy.    I hear good things about Fabric and Pacha, Ministry of Sound is a bit far out...also try Bar Salsa.|`|4OEFz6OMaa	fabric is apparently a pretty good club, its open til 9am but dont go if you dont like being around people who dont just drink alcohol, if you know what i mean. i didnt like it but they mention it on the mighty boosh and my friends love it  xx
alANwaiPaa	It all depends on your interest, here are a few places YS Falls Dunns River Falls, Mystic Mountain, Negril 7 mile beach, Hellshire Beach, Blue Lagoon, Margaritaville, Cranbrook farms, Appleton Estate Blue Mountain Bike tours, Dolphin Cove. I would suggest you rent a car and start in Ocho Rios spend a day or two and move on to Mo bay spend a day or two and then on to Negril and then Kingston from there you can make a run to Portland and you would have circled Jamaica. contact me if you need assistance.|`|QXQWDw1qaa	Are you going to Jamaica because you don't know about any other islands and that one is advertised on TV?  Why would you go to Jamaica when there are some really NICE islands to go to in the Caribbean?
FQ4nhSiRaa	You can use the dining plan at the resorts and at some restaurants at Downtown Disney also. But if you are going to be having some meals elsewhere: Universal, Sea World, etc. then I would just go without the meal plan.|`|0wTzlG2haa	You don't have to go into the park to eat! You can eat at your resort or any other resort for that matter, including character meals at the other resort if you have a plan with table service meals or at the Boardwalk or at some of the locations in Downtown Disney. Some of the resort restaurants are great. We love Boma at Animal Kingdom Lodge and Spoodles on the Boardwalk.    PLUS  you don't have to use your meals or snacks in any order. You can use all seven of your snacks on one day if you want to. You can go a day without using any of your meals if you want. You also can use two table service meals at Cinderella's Castle or at one of the dinner shows like the luau at the Polynesian.|`|mTwn8p79aa	It's not likely worth it.  I'd plan on eating off property for most of your meals.  You can find a lot better food for a lot less money.|`|UyW4UVBhaa	It all depends on how you use your dining plan and which one you have. If you have the quick service plan you can use it for breakfast and a dinner before and after the other parks or use it for breakfast lunch and dinner while you are at the parks. If you are on the base dining plan you can do the same as above with the counter service portion and do some signature dining (2 credits) for your sit down meal. If you get hungry while at the other parks just grab something lite that won't take a big bite out of your budget.    Linda  http://wdwtravels.com/Linda.aspx
tUYkerS9aa	No. It had a bad reputation that has stuck. There are still parts where there are regular hold-ups but there have been a lot of improvements eg by Heathrow.     Like all motorways if you do get stuck in a traffic jam for whatever reason there is not a lot you can do about it - most other roads you can turn around and take an alternative route - you just have to sit it out.|`|UZcUIfwIaa	Nothing wrong with the M25, it's the traffic that's the problem..|`|AA10711210	I think so. I have been doing the M25 at odd times, odd days for 30 years, even at the rush hour and have rarely had a problem.|`|0sw9nrcpaa	nope its really really bad near the m4 and m3 it really is shocking. one traffic jam went all the way round in 1992 and more peple were in the jam than live in new zealand!|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Yes, and Yes|`|98JZcrO6aa	British people like to complain and make a big deal out of everything i guess, i'm one of them =D|`|AA11349530	depends which section of the M25 ... the area around Heathrow is notorious|`|cN6AMupIaa	No its not that bad at all in 20 years of using the herfordshire and essex stretches of the M25 i was stuck in 2 major accident hold ups most of the delays were due to rubber neckers of accidents or road works. The biggest pain was when they were widening the holmsdale tunnel at Enfield j25 when the entry slip east bound and the exit slip west bound were closed for 18 months. the detour was 14 miles if you did not know to come off or get on it at Waltham Abbey j26. They are currently widening the Epping Tunnel between 26 & 27 so there are some delays at peak times for another year yet.
7bnQmXksaa	Probably not, You would need to give more information. Who is picking you up at the airport? where are you staying? who with? what is your connection to the person you are visiting? They just bombed Bogota this morning. I have been there I would say stay home unless you provide more details and I can re answer your question. Alone I would say common sense says stay home,,|`|58EydBwwaa	If she is going to be supervised by a family, I would say absolutely yes! It is safe. Latin American families are also particularly close. They take the expression "the guest is sacred" to heart.     Don't let the media scare you - Colombians are friendly, and protective people. As a female travelling alone (I am 21 but look younger) I never felt threatened or unsafe. Bogota is VERY well policed, and they will go above and beyond the call of duty to help out a tourist in trouble. I think it would be a great cultural experience for your daughter, and a chance to explore one of the less-traveled parts of the world. Plus no one plays soccer quite like they do in Latin America...    My email is dirtybeatles@yahoo.com if you have any more questions. I have travelled extensively in Colombia and I had nothing but positive experiences. :)|`|AdIrjmV7aa	No|`|S77199zgaa	I don't know of anywhere in the world where it is safe for a 14 year old t travel alone.|`|QepcG34Vaa	I dont think a fourteen year old traveling alone in any part of the world  would be safe (Except if  your traveling to Humacao, Puerto Rico). In general I think that latin american families are very nice and trustworthy specially in Colombia(dont get scared by the media) But Im not trying to scare you when I say Colombia's biggest problem is with narcos, but at least the big cities dont have that much of that problem. But do you know his(her) family? Do you really trust that person? From US to Colombia is a really long trip, an Colombia has places that even the goverment has a hard time controling because of there location, and also they are controlled by Las Farc. Bogota and Medellin are safe places in Colombia, (But Im talking in general because like any other place in the world there is crime)  Im implying that if that person is not trustworthy, you might never see her again (Colombia may not be as big as the usa but like i said before it has places that even the goverment has a hard time controling). So good luck in anything you choose, and remenber the only real safe place that a fourteen year old could go to with closed eyes is in Humacao, Puerto Rico, trust me!.

AA11159828	mmm 4 days!?  If you plan on going Back and forth to the island on each day it will cost you almost as much as a room on the island($about 60-80 each trip, with the trip each way taking about 1.5 hours)  If you want to be cheap, bring camping gear, and stay at one of the campgrounds(you didnt mention whether he was in Avalon or Two Harbors)    Remember to get reservations for the Ferry across(especially on Friday,Sat or Sunday)(the ferries leave from three places)    The weather can be cold in that time of year (depending on whether storm are still giving LA Rain) and if it has rained very recently before you go, the trip over can be a real bumpy ride on the boat(lots of Waves!)|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Can you PLEASE fix your question?!?|`|YjFDfp5Paa	Have you checked out http://www.couchsurfing.com|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	If you can't afford Catalina, then don't go.    If you're asking about Texas, try the Houston forum.    Remember, anything along the water in SoCal is going to be expensive. Try Pismo or Carpinteria.|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	Too expensive to stay in Catalina?  It is like 120 bucks a night?  If you want to stay in a Ca hotel for less than that?  You will end up in a ghetto motel six, where all your personal possesions will disappear, the minute you leave your room.  You can not do better than that, on the mainland!.  If a trip to Catalina is too expensive, then your trip to California, is too expensive. Sorry!    I have never looked at lodging costs in Catalina, but always have thought that that it would be far more expensive than 119 per night.  I think that that price, is a value!.  When my family has saved up money, we will treat ourselves to a weekend trip to Dana Point, and stay at either the doubletree (if we saved a lot) or the Best Western, if we have saved less, and truly enjoy, the trip.  Seems a trip to Catalina, is a real value, for the area.
6badd34d141bfd095958e0b3839b2117aa	The double decker tour bus was awesome and it takes you all over the city.  Coyuocan was a neat little colonia with a great market.  Xocimilcho was a water passage system the aztecs, now it is still used.  You can go and ride in a lancha through the water ways.  They decorate all the boats with flower wreaths and mariachas in little boats come and serenade you as you float along.  As far as souvenirs...mexican candies and hot chocolate,Coffee, pottery, all sorts of artesanias.|`|AA10042296	Go to Bazaar Sabado on Saturday.

They are absolutely stunning and make political statements, but he was such an exquisite painter.  Everyone goes there.  There's a lot to write about.    The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadelope is amazing as well.  The Virgin Mary appeared there and people make pilgrimages there.  The crowds and experience is overwhelming.    Take a trip to the ruins at Teotihuacan.  The pyramids are impressive.      Silver is abundant as a souvenir.  You can also buy beautiful native masks made from different semi-precious stones/jewels like larimar and onyx.  I'd recommend something from the basilica.  Sterling silver rosaries are unique.|`|MBEBZqqsaa	La Ciudadela in Mexico City is a nice market for souvenirs and I suppose an interesting place to visit, as well.
EjhJliKmaa	with the global financial crisis affecting cebu really hard, i would say that it would be better to start your own business.  you could start your own church because religion, in itself, is big business nowadays.
vl6OtBfWaa	You can start your day with breakfast at "Beauty's" corner mount royal and st urbain this is also the neighorhood of famous Montreal writer Mordecai Richler.  while in the neighborhood walk over to Fairmount and st urbain or st. viateur and parc for some of Montreal's world famous bagels at fairmount bagel or st viateur bagel .  Or you could try Wilensky's at the corner of clark  fairmount a famous toasted sandwich shop that still has an old fashion soda fouintain.    Then it being winter you can either go downtown to warm up in the underground city for shopping dining and people watching or brave the cold on Mount Royal visiting Beaver lake the lookout or even Mcgill University.    Over to Second cup or any other cafe for some hot chocolate to warm up.  Then back to your room to change for the evening out.  Dinner at Moishes?  The best steak house in North America (st laurent blvd)  but bring your visa card cuz moishes dont come cheap.  Or perhaps Buona Notte  also on St. laurent blvd. or Globe also on St. laurent.    Now out to the clubs and bars try Crescent street for dozens of trendy clubs and bars taverne Crescent or Electric Avenue.  Or go to Rosalie where you can rub elbows with sports stars and their groupies.    The list is endless just bring lots of energy and a willingness to have a good time.

Dz9XNIOoaa	Well why didnt you just ask meh?  San Diego is beautiful :)  the weather is really mild. may and june are normally really rainy though, but the spring is great there. summer can get hot, especially if your near the mountains. on average the tempertature doesnt go too far outside of 50-70 F  Downtown San DIego has alot of skyscrapers and restraunts, theres a good veiw of it from coronado. (which is also gorgeous)  but housing in expensive. an average HOUSE in SD is about 600,00$  but if you split the coast of an apartment it would be considerably less  pacific beach is one of the places that has the best night life, but rentals are expensive because thats where alot of the college kids are  you could probobly find the best price on an apartment somewhere near the mountains. like mission valley or mission hills, which has homes along the canyon and such  jobs are, well, there arent a TON of them available. It is a crowded city  and as for the quickest route?  well, the blue one looks like the straighter shot  but it really depends on the type of road you'd be driving on (highways, back roads, etc) depending on whether you planned to stay at hotels along the way, or just in the RV. which also factors into how much its going to cost :)|`|EvlPzrVOaa	ok basically to find out how much it cost to get there, is kinda easy. if you rv gets 300 miles to a full tank, and you have hm 5000 miles. your looking at just over 16 gas fill up to get there. so how ever much it takes to fill up one tank times that by 17........ now if it takes 3 days to get there then estimate 30 bucks a nite a a rv overnite place. thats 60-70 bucks there.  now since you have to eat and you stop just the 17 times to fill up look at maybe 10 bucks for food an drinks. then the overnite look at maybe 20 bucks a nite since you might eat at a restaurant. for rent i would try an find out what newspaper is there an then look at the classifieds for rent. im guessing somewhere about 400 a month. im thinking if you are 5000 miles or mroe the real time to get there would be 6 or 7 days esp in a rv. since most people just drive 8 hrs a day. 5000miles/8= 6.25 days. this is just the basics.

All I wanted to do was SLEEP, and even with the aircon on full, it was useless.    I kept flipping my pillow to a cold side that wasn't there.    Just a note to make your drinks colder -- put your cups in the freezer!!    I work in hotels and it is a common occurance to chill/freeze glasses, as they make the drinks slightly colder.    Stay as still as possible in dark rooms with your fan/aircon on full.    Your computer gives off heat, if it gets that bad in the room you're in, turn that off too.

Can't wait till 30 degrees on sunday!!|`|3gfoyhGeaa	spent the day at the pool!  it was great!|`|OesaUfvDaa	I go in my pool and lie down in from of the fan all day. I havn't tried the egg thing but I've always wanted to...|`|77a4EGxWaa	we have had our evaporative cooling on for over 24 hours now (and probably will stay on till sunday), 22 degrees is the temp inside the house. no power outages around my area.... yet|`|8cfvN5voaa	we got ac turned on in our office, it cant keep up. it so hot in here..its exactly 31.5C inside my office.... at home?? oh god.. i have a fan while i sleep (sleep..its a BIG word..), my hubby sleeps in the other room with another fan... we got one of them ac in the living room that doesnt even do its job... its just too hot.... and yeah, hubby put up one of them silver sheets by the living room huge window...the sun is on it the whole day.... my poor dogs outside.. of course, they got plenty of water and shade.... cant wait to go home and put them inside the house....|`|ull7Ukdoaa	Its impossible to keep cool today!! I've been in the pool like ten times and its not helping!! I've given up. We  just have to deal with the ridiculous heat for a week.|`|K85qdy38aa	Right now I'm rubbing one of those ice block things over my face :)  Not the ones you put IN your drink, but the ones that you sit the drink bottle on when it's in a case.|`|kMu3d8g0aa	I was swimming at the beach at midnight! :)|`|I1rVZxSsaa	I'm studying abroad from America and I'm loving the weather! I left New Jersey two days before a snowstorm. It was 23 degrees F I wore a coat and scarf on the plane and got off with a skirt on! So maybe I am one of the few people enjoying the weather and walking in the heat happily.|`|IRFaBtr4aa	Very very hot!  I reckon the best way to cool your self is to spray water on yourself and stay in front of a fan/air conditioner and drink plenty of FREEZING water! Works every time for me :D    Good Luck!|`|zFPn7OJTaa	no power outage for me yet. I don't use the train lines that often either.    No haven't tried to fry an egg on concrete yet, but the egg would bake before fry, I heard    Well keeping cool isn't an option when the air conditioning in 90% of the classrooms I am taught in, have air conditioning that shuts off every 5 seconds because the motor has overheated. I get to stay home tomorrow because mum says school is useless when it's that hot, you can't learn.
IgEOB2Braa	You could look into being an international courier. Not easy to get into but you might eventually be able to do that.     You could be a nurse and travel to different countries on temporary assignments. You would go where there are nursing shortages (and what places DON'T have a nursing shortage?) and stay for a few months and work. But on your days off, you can sightsee plus you will still earn a good income.
9f69caba93a81006ba7e01544d9418a3aa	Whenever you are sending anything internationally there is a possibility that it gets held up in customs.  This is more than likely what happened since it usually doesn't take this long to arrive.  Of course, there is always the possibility of it getting lost/stolen, but I bet it shows up within a week or two.  Good Luck.|`|RSrnKPIkaa	it might be stolen|`|aLy3ai90aa	Sounds like your package was sent surface mail (By Boat). This could take 1 month to 3 months for delivery. You should have been aware of this.
2FsNdcXEaa	I've lived in Cali my whole life, but I've been to every state. These are my top 5 favorite big cities, in order:  1.Seattle  2. NYC  3. San Francisco  4. Portland  5. Chicago|`|OMs2EuTuaa	i am from the uk, but went on a business trip to minneapolis.  I thought it was a clean, friendly city with a vibrant culture/night life and was very impressed!  would love to go back one day!|`|AA10640608	Seattle is a good choice. Also Denver, Houston or Southern California but it will be a shock after NYC.  Good luck!!
uKWcgLLoaa	It's the coolest, Man!    Sounds like you'll love Seattle. Often called "most livable big city" in the country, Seattle is not even as cold and rainy as it's reputation has come to be (concocted by locals trying to keep the outsiders away), but sounds like you won't have any issue on those days that are!    The kind of job you are seeking may take some effort to find in this slow economy, but things aren't as bad here as most places so you will probably do as well here in that regard as anywhere.|`|vTra7n5baa	That's a hard question to answer because your situation isn't 100% clear.  Seattle is okay if you want to/already are married and just want to keep to your family life.  Food quality and other services are above average too.  But if you're single and want to socialize with new people, you'll find the "natives" of Seattle either fake nice or passive-aggressive.  You basically have to have been a friend of theirs in high school to get anywhere.  People are also just generally afraid to do things and commit to them.  For example, I personally and several friends of mine looking for jobs there have been led on to think we were going to get the job ONLY to have the possible employer say "maybe", "we're not sure", or "we're just testing now".  Be prepared for a lot of non-committal wish-washiness.  The night life is also meager and people are clickish at clubs.  Public transportation is also half-assed -- there won't be anything resembling a metro there until 2016.  But if you don't mind a slow, cyclical way of life, Seattle would be okay.  Otherwise, head to Vancouver, SF, or even Portland if you want a better Western city.|`|NGWgkdr4aa	Yes, Seattle is a very suitable, and urban place to live in if you like the city|`|lPDRQH7aaa	Yes but it is very urban. Definitely good for someone your age! A lot of things to do. But too much rain for me!|`|8oi3gCZoaa	I don't know anything about Seattle but I do suggest that you check out Seattle newspapers, which you can do online, to get general information and see what's going on, and that you check out their classified ads to see what kind of jobs are offered.  Just google "Seattle newspapers" to get started.  You might try googling "Seattle sales job," too.    You can also go to monster.com and specify the city in which you want to work and they will show you jobs in that area.    Good luck.|`|BcLmETzJaa	In regards to somebody saying the bus system is half assed, I HIGHLY disagree. Highly. I've been hitch hiking around for 2 years off and on and have seen bus systems in many other cities and I have to say Seattle's is the best I have seen so far. The busses in Seattle [or surrounding cities with another bus sytem that connects to seattle's] go everywhere.. to all surrounding cities. I can think, off the top of my head, of many cities the busses take you to- Shoreline, Kirkland, Bothell, Woodinville, Bellevue, Redmond, Tacoma, Federal Way, Kent, Auburn, Everett, Lynwood, Tukwilla, Renton.. ALSO, you can literally take busses ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PORTLAND OREGON for about 6-9 dollars if you know which to take. And all cities in between on the freeway [Lacey, Olympia, Tumwater, Centralia, Toledo, Kelso, Longview, Vancouver.. probably a few other small towns I'm forgetting]. I have done the trip many many times and I know for a fact it's still up and running. You have to take city busses to Tumwater and then there is a bus called the CAP that takes you all the way to vancouver for 2 dollars.. literally.. and then from there take a bus or walk over the bridge to portland.     I love Seattle, it is my home town and I am very proud to be there. And after hitching around and seeing a lot of other cities my heart still belongs in Seattle.|`|d64tdp6saa	I believe that Seattle is a great place to live because a lot of people live there and because it is the best city in the area besides Portland, Oregon. Seattle is also right next the Puget sound, and you can go to Vancouver, B.C and California. GOOD JOB!!!! =D
Yfp74Xqtaa	Go to Australia if you want to, in itself, it's a great place. However do not count on making you're fortune through a vet clinic. Maybe you will, but just as much as in many/ most other Western countries.|`|TDszW6Yfaa	we have enough vets in australia.    they were born in australia.    they studied in australia.    and we are full, no more room.|`|WNnNclnhaa	What do you mean?    Do you want to know if you can have pets in your apartment?    Heaps of people have pets, and there are lots of vets needed especially during summer.    Good luck
IElaDNIbaa	Boat to NY then train to LA|`|fSwpE4ziaa	stay away from ohio and kentucky. i live in fairfield ohio, and the police are out of control here, profiling is very very bad, if you are a male and you are around twenty you WILL get pulled over and searched at least once a week, ive had my car ripped apart many times (my steering wheel is broken) because they assume everyone has drugs. one certain cop has pulled over everyone i know
7lt9olCLaa	hi, you mean the crazy, amazing tasting 'pop' from England! any of the shops that sell "Yee Olde" english stuff. there is one on Lygon St, Carlton (between Grattan and Faraday Sts). Also one in Collins Place on Collins st in the city (it's upstairs). hope you find some!|`|dohhfGTfaa	If you mean the dried herb for tea, then both Dandelion and Burdock are available at any health food shop.
