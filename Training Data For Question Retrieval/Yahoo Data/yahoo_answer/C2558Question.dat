What could of caused this? And how can I make sure this doesn't happen again?      A couple of months ago I noticed smoke would come out from the exhaust when I would start the car. Doesn't happen everytime, maybe 4-5 times a month. And the oil pressure level always seems to go down when the car's idle.    I bought this car, 05 pathfinder, back in sept. 08 with 45k miles on it.

I have a Rover 420 2.0 and it's really comfortable with low mileage but it's a bit big for just me and it uses up a lot of petrol. It has a sun roof, air con and alloy wheels. I have seen a Fiat Brava 1.4 the same age that will be cheaper on the petrol and insurance. It has alloy wheels but no sun roof. Am I being sensible in getting a Brava?

20081006125737AALlzC9	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I have just aquired an immaculate Rover 214 2 door sprint.?	Thanks for all the previous head advice which precluded the purchase.   The engine starts and runs beautifully. However though it doesn't seem to lose water into the oil there is gunge / oil in the water filler expansion tank, so I am taking it that I have got to replace the head gasket.   The question is :   When the engine has warmed up it cuts out and dies. It starts up on the ignition after before cutting out again. A few hours later it starts up again and runs beautifully again.   Does this confirm a blown H/gasket or could it be something else.   My experience of rebuilding is mainly with older fords including Capri's    and the ford powered Scimitar . So these old Rovers are a bit modern    in comparison.   Thanks   Chris.

Do you guys really think your HID kits look just as good as cars that are equipped with HIDs from the factory? A lot of cars with these HID kits are blinding and look cheap. They have the same color throughout the entire beam pattern unlike cars equipped with HID projectors which have a blue/orange/yellow tint at the cutoff line and pure white light below that line.      Do you really think you look like a car who came out of the factory with those lights?
20070124084943AAGon4U	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car won't heat up?	When it's cold, I will start up the car to try to warm it up.  But it'll never blow out warm air until I actually start driving the car, even if I let it sit for a half hour!  I notice that the temperature gauge is always on the cold side.  What could be the problem?

20070127193044AAmf8J0	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car was involved in an accident a few months ago?	The trunk door was smashed in, but it was replaced today with a used trunk door similar to the car's original one. The problem is the sign that notifies you if a door is not closed correctly will not shut off because of the new trunk door ( which is closed properly). I'm wondering if this could make the car battery die. Thanks in advance!
20070129135243AA4vvw3	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Sono daltonico e alcuni semafori mi fanno impazzire! Devo farmi ritirare la patente?	Sono daltonico (confondo soprattutto rosso e verde), e finora non ho mai avuto grossi problemi coi semafori. Il problema Ã¨ quando mi sposto dalla mia cittÃ , dove incontro semafori che non conosco.. addirittura ne ho visti alcuni a 4 display (rosso, giallo, verde, freccia), e specie su questi mi ingarbuglio specie quando Ã¨ sera. A volte poi, sempre di sera, se sto lontano non riesco a capire di che diavolo di colore sia il semaforo e non so se correre perchÃ© Ã¨ verde o rallentare perchÃ© Ã¨ rosso.      Soluzioni?

Any tips on getting this to dry out faster? I'd rather not have my truck reek like stinky dog or something.

20080226063119AAZfuLH	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	En Mexico, por que no somos mas amables al manejar?	He notado que en Mexico a diferencia de otros paises como USA por ejemplo, y sobretodo en la zona centro somos muy agresivos al manejar sin educacion, nos pasamos los altos, les hechamos el carro a los demas autos o peatones, rebasamos por el acotamiento, los peatones ven que ya tienen el rojo y se pasan con su calma, si alguien pone su direccional - pues no le pegamos el carro para que no pueda dar vuelta, si vamos a dar vuelta en u y viene un carro, pues le acelera mas,etc.   Por que no cambiamos un poco?   Desde hace como tres a?os me he dado a la tarea de ser amable al manejar y casi en todos mis trayectos me dan las gracias y ya casi no se ve, se sorprenden, pero se siente bien con uno mismo.   Quien quiere probar? como es en tu pais?

20070521123735AAyhAmi	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	A I the only one that feels the oil companies are bending us over and sticking it to us when we buy gasoline?	What is wrong with this scenario?  The numbers are just for illustration. When oil was $10 a barrel gas was 80 cents a gallon. When oil was $40 a barrel, gas was $1.75 a gallon. When oil dropped to $20 a barrell, gas dropped to $1.50 a gallon. Oil could drop to $1 a barrell but now that we are used to paying high prices, gas will never drop to low levels again.

20080317122725AAcWsBP	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Nissan	Question about Bra-Hood for 1998 Nisson 200sx?	For any of you who know quite a bit about cars... I have a really random question!       I like in Spokane and this year we had a HORRIBLE winter, so the hood of my car is a reck from all the rocks, and salt! And as an outcome I looked into buying a bra for the hood. to help limit the amount of dents!       So here is my question! Everywhere ive looked over the internet, it seems bras for Nisson Altimas/ Maximas are a heck of a lot CHEAPER! and thought perhaps my car is a little version of an Altima! and therefor maybe a bra for an Altima could in fact fit my 200sx!       But i don't know if they are different in size in regards to the hood!       HELP?! :)       Or if you know of a cite that has cheaper bras. Ide rather not pay 100.00 dollers for a bra that is made for this old of a car!       THANK YOU!
