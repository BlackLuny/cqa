20070809065305AARyhSR	News & Events;Other - News & Events	Para el día del ni?o ?Puedo dejarles algo?	BAJITOS QUE SON GIGANTES    Es peque?o, la vida no le otorgó la oportunidad de ser como los demás ni?os, nunca conoció una escuela, no tuvo compa?eritos de aula, tampoco una linda maestra que le ense?ara con amor las primeras letras.   Su casa era la calle, allí donde estaban los peligros, pero a este peque?o gigante no le importaba, con las monedas que juntaba por día ayudaba a su madre y hermanitos más peque?os que él.   Se levanta junto a su mamá muy temprano, compran flores en el mercado,que el ni?o después se las ingenia en vender.   Su vida es pobre, pero él es un chico feliz, sabe que con esfuerzo los platos de comida de su familia no estarán vacíos.   Peina sus cabellos hacia atrás su carita de luna siempre regala una sonrisa, los ojos negros muchas veces ante la indiferencia y prejuicios de los grandes se nublan de lágrimas, pero él sigue su derrotero.   Salta entre los autos ofreciendo su mercancía, no mide el peligro, regala una amplia sonrisa a quien le compra flores, se aleja callado y vencido cuando las ventanillas cerradas de los autos le muestran indiferencia.      Que se vengan los chicosde todas partes   Que estén los de la Lunay los de Marte   Que se vengan los chicos   de los planetas   prendidos de la colade algún cometa   Que no falte ninguno   pa' mi cumplea?os y   que no se preocupenpor los regalos      Este peque?o no sabe de días que lo festejen, los juguetes que a veces encuentra en la calle los lleva a sus hermanitos.   Hace días que no lo veo, lo extra?o, era parte del paisaje de Buenos Aires, el vendedor de diarios ante mi insistencia me contó que el ni?o fue atropellado por un conductor que se dio a la fuga, estuvo varios minutos tendido en el pavimento hasta que una ambulancia lo llevó a un hospital cercano.   Este domingo iré a verlo, le llevaré los juguetes que conoce de lejos, serán su primer tesoro.   Me recibe con una sonrisa, con un marcador dibujo el yeso que cubre su piernita, le prometo que volveré siempre a visitarlo, él que es todo corazón me pide que acompa?e a su madre quien vive lejos del hospital en un pueblito de la provincia.   La mirada de éste peque?o me dio fortaleza, desde ese día todos los días festejaremos el día del ni?o cada día del a?o para que nada le falte, otras personas con corazón están dispuestas a ayudarme

It seems to be the case that in Baby P's death, errors of judgement were made on at least one occassion      More obviously, in the awful case of Victoria Climbie, in 2000, after abuse by her Aunt and boyfriend led to her death, highlighted horrific errors by Social services.      Another sad case was Amy Labonte in 2002. starved to death by her parents. Social workers on her case, it emerged, were too frightened of the parents to properly visit the home.      All cases where a social worker was already assigned.      Not a knee jerk reaction, but if you think about it, these people are there to help identify and protect at-risk children. Sure, the evil of some parents/carers is not their fault, but is it maybe a point that social workers need better training?      I mean surely once a Social Worker is on the case, signs that a child being slowly starved/tortured/abused is obvious???      Maybe you feel on the whole they are adequately trained and these are rare cases.

The company feels that they are not at fault, is the government at fault.?. Who is at fault here someone is and it should be the contractor and when will they fix the problem so that this is no longer a problem? Why do our soldiers have to die of this cause? Like their lives aren't threatened enough as it is! This is so uncalled for and there doesn't seem to be much action being taken - This makes me angry!!! I am so beside myself to think that this even happened to begin with and that it is still continuing and that the government hasn't already put a stop to this - Are people loosing their lives b/c the government doesn't want to fire that company and hire one that will make sure the job is done right and be sure that this never happens again? Why hasn't that Company already been fired and what happened to our own military electricians???? I am so confused and out-raged!!! This doesn't bother you?

20090305074442AAieq0w	News & Events;Current Events	Is Rush Limbaugh in cahoots with the Dems?	Think about it.  Rush is paid via his radio show which needs millions of listeners to attract advertisers.  And last year he inked an 8 yr 400 million dollar contract.  So, he needs to keep his profile up in order to sell ads.        And the Democrats need a new bogeyman.  So, this new Rush vs. Democrat feud is win-win for everyone!  The Democrats win elections and Rush gets his money.  Which is really what either side cares about.      Is it just me or maybe the two are in bed together somehow?
20090305075641AAySKmj	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Can someone summarize this article for me like now?	NEW YORK – TO BE RELEVANT, ART must respond to the choices, changes and challenges of these fluid, turbulent times and help create the conditions necessary to transform society and deal with consequences, where the burning issues of the day become the overriding factor in the pursuit of a meaningful popular culture.   All artists are active participants in these current cross cultural dynamics and cannot afford to be left out in the cold or live the solitary, isolated existence under the pretentious mask of artistic indifference. To be catalysts for change, artists need to constantly question their own motives, unfair policies affecting creative freedom and one's role in a society; to continuously evolve and not waste valuable time worrying about their reputation after they’re dead.   Much as we respect the choices most artists make for themselves, there’s an underlying need for them to document their own times - the sweeping political changes happening around us; to grapple with the issues as they come and try to create art that amplify and project opportunities for change to a larger audience.   The enormous impact of Western popular culture on diverse communities worldwide has reached a point where we cannot afford to allow a handful of privileged few to define its form and content without the active participation of socially committed members of the international Arts community.   It’s sad to note that the onslaught of American popular culture has marginalized, if not totally wiped out, indigenous cultures in many parts of the world. Poor, underdeveloped countries with rich cultural heritage have been 'touched' by the magic wand of Hollywood and are fighting back its negative impact on their traditional way of life.   Cultural amnesia- the loss of traditional values, oral history and indigenous art forms, have now become more prevalent than in the past as more and more ethnic communities are quick to adapt what they see on the screen as 'progress' and accept it to be far better than what they have had for centuries. I hope the scheduled conference on social theory, on politics and the arts would address these concerns to be able to institute necessary changes to safeguard the integrity of indigenous communities.   The upcoming 33rd Conference on Social Theory, Politics and the Arts is a continuing dialogue by participants drawn not only from artists in the visual, performing, written and multi media arts but also from a broad range of disciplines that include sociology, political science, management, economics, law, urban planning and policy studies. Hosted by The New York foundation for the Arts, The Arts Council of Manhattan, the NYU Roberts Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and the Research Center for Leadership in Action, this year's conference aims "to explore new trends, practices and public policy issues affecting and shaping the arts around the world."   Last March, I had the privilege of taking part in an art exhibition at a Chelsea gallery in NYC and was glad to see quite a number of artworks that explored the political realities of   American life, skillfully calculated to question and disturb viewers from their private complacency. There is no question that the New York art scene has been regarded as the crystal ball of new things to come; unfortunately, the current crop of art pieces had nothing much to say and even failed miserably to amuse.   Despite living in the shadows of 9/11, political art in NYC is still groping in the dark ages, seemingly destined to be graffiti outside gallery walls. Quite a number of NY-based artists I’ve met, whose works revolve around the current political debates, lament that most art galleries won't dare touch 'political art' with the proverbial ten feet pole.   Art galleries are primarily business driven and understandably more concerned with their return of investments. Unfortunately some even expound that myth that artists should stay away and be apolitical, to paint only decorative, 'saleable' pieces that would go well in upscale condo units. What gets hanged or not hanged in galleries have a great impact on popular culture and most galleries would cringe at anything resembling 'breaking news' from war zones.   But for most artists to continue doing what they’re good at, they have to live on their art. But since the market for political art, if one has to survive on it, is not much, this could initially discourage some artists from investing much of their creative time on it. Hopefully gallery owners would realize that political art has its niche in our lives.   In contrast is the swelling tide of books on current political debates. I can't help but envy those writers and publishing houses that dare focus their efforts and resources to bring about the truth regardless of consequences. Whistleblowers, anti-war groups, civil disobedience advocates and environmental activist are all having a field day.   These writers have successfully rammed their political views
