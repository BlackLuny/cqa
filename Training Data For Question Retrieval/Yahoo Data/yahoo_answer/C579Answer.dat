The posterior primary teeth are also smaller and shaped differently than the permanent teeth although this does take some experience to see the difference.  If a child has a removed a tooth by themselves it is most likely a primary tooth.

TK2GmcOhaa	Well.. I went through a stage like this too, don't wory I'll help you to get out of it.     1: Councillor - it is pointless going if you 'put on the happy front' it'll just make you feel worse...    2: School: it's hard, it's going to be tough - but go back, you want good grades, a nice house and kids when you're older. Go back - you'll make new friends. I promise, just please, go back! I did - leaving was the worst mistake in my life.    3: Friends: you lost practically all.. all or not? If you still have some - get in contact and quickly they will help you.    4: Cut the self pity, no social life, no friends, no fun, no energy and everythings always apparently my fault... get rid of it!!! It's not good, try and be more positive thinking, you CAN do this!    5: A great cure is listening to music, ones that you can dance to, Michael Jackson is best - honestly... don't knock it! He can sing and he can dance... so listen! Dance around like a maniac! It helps.    6: Do some exercise - running's best as it is easiest - just shove on some trainers, go out the front door and jog around the block... try just a few minutes at first and slowly build up - it gives you a great feeling!    7: Read some manga books - Vampire Knight and Fruits Basket are great ones - really touching. Read them on here:    www.onemanga.com  www.mangafox.com    If it's not on one, it'll be on the other.    8: Steer away from emo bands and depressing news - live your life, in your world... stop cutting yourself and face the world with determination!    ...    9: Contact me, please. I would love to know how you're getting on, remember I battled through all of this - I can help you! Please, no one has ever contacted me, so I'm asking you - please!    albatross.lorenzo@yahoo.com    xxx    I'll try and solve ALL your problems, just ask.    xxx|`|MQx6fz8aaa	wow they dont make kids the same i swear to god kids now a days are coming so messed up now. i mean shes 13 and already cutting herself thats just sad. if any of you emos read this jus kill yourselfs already or else stop bitching bout life and get on with it!!!|`|2cf6501c9a3f33cf51f80b825ae1fa82aa	There is nothing easy about being 13, trust me I've been there. You sound very defeated and so it will be hard to bounce back but I believe you can if you really want to. Sometimes we have to hit "rock bottom" before we can start back up, and it sounds like this might be you.    Life can be overwhelming, so just try to tackle one thing at a time. Write a list of the things you want improved in your life, and under each one write down some ideas about how you can accomplish that. Try to work on one each day and slowly (but surely!) you will see that area of your life improve.   For example: You want friends back.   Ideas to accomplish this: call ONE friend after school (so they are alone and won't feel influenced by others around them) and just have a quick chat. depending on how that goes, try calling a couple of other friends each day. If that goes well, invite one (or a few) of them to your house, or to a movie one night. If it doesn't, maybe try thinking of ways you can meet new people (clubs, church, etc.)    You will be able to come up with better ideas than me, because you know your life better, but you get the idea. SMALL steps are key.    Also, you need to be seeing a counselor that you can REALLY open up to. Don't see a school counselor, or someone you can't relate to. Tell your parents that your current therapy isn't working because you aren't comfortable but you really need to talk to someone. I also think you need to tell them about the cutting so they know you have a serious problem. Your parents would be the ideal people to talk to but sometimes I know it's hard.    PLEASE stop cutting, you don't want to eventually do something you can't take back.|`|a6f8IoISaa	you need to think of all the things that you like about yourself, it sounds like you are having a hard time accepting who you are. you really need to get back into school and really talk to someone you trust about your problems. everyone deserves a full and happy life. I'm sorry you're feeling this way!|`|iybezfi6aa	Jasmine, sweetheart, this is sad. You really need to get real with your therapist. Or get another one.

I have had depression before but never so serious that I cut myself! I don't know how religious you are but for me when I get so down, I read some scripture or I pray! It helps me so much because you always have a friend in God! Also if you just need someone to talk to shoot me an email!     As for finding friends, you need to just be yourself, but act as happy as possible! People are not attracted to unhappiness or depression, (I know this!) Even if you are literally gluing a smile on it will help you! Try to think of everything you love in life, even if its just something silly like a favorite song!     Last of all STOP CUTTING! Its very unproductive and leaves you with more self hatred! Please remember Jasmine that you are special! Do things that make you happy and remember that God loves you!|`|upazUCA6aa	aww you poor Baby :)|`|u7YIC77Xaa	You've got to tell your councillor the truth. You won't get better otherwise.

They will not look down on you for your honesty either.  Their job is to help you through whatever you're going through.  It's okay and a lot of people go through the same things.|`|40whdSDYaa	meet ppl over the internet =]....start taking walks...idk...do sumin to get u out of the house...then u will start getting ur confidence back...and u will be able to go to skool...wat made u so depressed? u can figure it out...|`|aVbLngqmaa	When I was 13 I was really depressed, too. Completely hated my life and was antisocial and also got in lots of fights at home. I'm 19 now and am pretty happy. Just know that you're going through a phase and that it will end. You will be happy in the future at some point. 12-14 are the worst days of a lot of people's lives. It's just a really awkward time where you get really confused and lots of changes are happening to you and to your life. It really sucks, I know. But just try and hang in there. Take up some hobbies, and do things that you want to do. Don't worry about what others think and don't let your schoolmates and parents bother you. My parents didn't understand me at all when I was 13 and we got in so many fights. I tried running away a few times....unsuccessfully. Don't blame your parents too much - I think they just don't understand. They don't really take you very seriously when you're 13 and don't think that you have real problems. For now, focus on the things you like doing. Drawing, painting, reading, watching movies, etc. And know that life really does get better once you get out of that weird awkward horrible stage that everyone usually goes through at some point.  Good luck!|`|AA11918487	pray pray pray  prayer changes everything.  if trust and believe he will make a way.  i know life gets hard sometimes and it seems like it always one thing after another. keep your head up girl i will keep you in my prayers.  and with you seeing a counseler. you should feel open and comfortable with your. counseler. since you don't try a find another one in your area.  EDUCATION IS VERY VERY IMPortant. knowlege is power try getting back in school. that is the first step.  good luck to you sweetie.|`|qHCtBq07aa	I know its hard but you need to talk to your counselor truthfully. Start out with small things and slowly try to open up, don't try to tell her everything right off the bat because then you will overwhelm yourself.   Don't listen to other people who just put you down. If they say again 'Well Jasmine is just another teenagers with fake problems trying to get atttention...', say to them if you don't want to help me that's fine but I do not need negative comments.   Find something to do. Try writing, exercising, running, some hobby that you like. Yoga, even. Then work your way up to meeting new people, and attempting a 'normal' lifestyle.   If your counselor doesn't know how depressed you are, I suggest you tell he/she because your cutting is becoming and is a serious problem. He/She can help you find better coping treatments and possibly talk to your family to help you in your rehabilitation.|`|iTFZr9dGaa	It's funny in a way because when i was 13 I went throe almost exactly the same thing's. I know it can be painful to have these feelings and I wish I can Give you the magic word that would mack this all feel like A Bad dream but i don't. I don't Know how u feel about religion but you should try reaching out to god. But if that is not ur preference Try to talk to ur Trusted Gardena or teacher. I did not do any of these things when I had this problem I just rode it out and I deeply regret My actions. I will pray for u Jasmine. And please don't do any thing to heart yourself.|`|GytKvNFoaa	read up on borderline personality disorder!!! it was what I had for years|`|gYSKXgpyaa	quite sad..edit babez  thumps dwn rampage or sumtin o_O  rasc*lzz|`|KOhl0BMmaa	I would stop skipping school and try to make some friends.

I don't know if this will work for you but it did for me, and I didn't need medication or anything.  Excersise, and learn to love your body no matter what. Be proud of what you got and don't compare yourself to anyone. Don't bash your body when all your friends are standing around going 'I'm fat, I have huge hips, blahblahblah.' Instead pick out something you like about it. Say, 'I like my bum; I think I have a nice bum.' haha, I swear it helps.  Hang out with your friends. Even if you don't get along all the time or don't have many friends, you can still just relax and have a good time. Make friends for life so you don't have to worry about impressing them. Love them for what they are no matter what and they'll do the same to you. Don't cause drama by talking about anyone behind their backs, and stay neutral if anyone fights. Just be a nice, sweet person and they'll appriciate you. Of course to do this you'll need to go back to school. Do good in school, get a tutor, whatever you need. It will help boost your self confidence alot, even just trying .  Spend some time alone. Get a hobby, I like to draw, and play guitair so work on something like that. I practiced so much that I have 2 new talents to be proud of. When I'm alone, I force myself to do my homework, then do some yoga, then get a bath. It feels amazing to have your homework done early, It's a huge laod taken off.  Most importantly, stay away from drugs and drinking, because that can lead to way worse problems, and ruin your future. Also, when you sober up you'll feel way worse than before. If your friends go out drinking, you can still go, but stay sober and keep an eye on everyone, they'll thank you later after you save someone from being taken advantage of. PLus its a depressiant so thats kind of pointless eh by.  So that is exactly why I'm not depressed anymore. Hope I helped, good luck:]|`|ceeNqETqaa	Hello.    HUG.    It's really important that you find someone you feel comfortable talking to. Anyone! Has your doctor offered you anything other than counselling because that doesn't work for everyone. It didn't work for me.    When I was 14, I took an overdose and I started cutting myself. I think you need to talk about how you truly feel, otherwise it will continue to eat you up inside. I am still troubled and to be honest I think I always will be to a certain degree. There's not always a reason for it, so if you really can't understand why you feel the way you do then it's probably just the way you've been made.   Depression runs in my family that's why I think I have it. The trick is to find things that make you feel good. For me it's happy films, music, sweets and animals. I'm getting a puppy on Monday and that has given me a real lift!    I know you don't know me, but I am here and I understand what you are going through.....|`|xTf52iCwaa	START going to school.  BE NICE to people.  GET FRIENDS.  THANK GOD you're alive and well.  PRAY.  LISTEN TO "Don't worry be Happy" by Bobby Mcferrin.  WATCH some comedy.  START doing sport.  EAT LESS - Eating can make you even more depressed.  And more importantly:    STOP feeling sorry for yourself!|`|eoGBWU3Oaa	I think that if you want to get the best of your councelling, you need to try and talk honestly about what's going on in your life. I started seeing psychiatrists when I was 14, and have been suffering from depression and other disorders since I was 11. They aren't there to judge you, and they won't think you are strange or a bad person. Their job is to provide somewhere that you can go to talk about your issue and try to work them out.     Another thing to try and work on is your opinion of yourself. If you keep believing that you are worthless and unloved, then you will never be able to work your way out of your depression. Everyday, try and write down at least one good thing has to happened to you during the day e.g. my teacher said my classwork was excellent, and one good thing that you've done for someone else e.g. I helped my brother with his homework. That way, you can start replacing the negative thoughts with positive ones.     If you want to chat, my email address is vv_alleycat@yahoo.com, feel free to contact me. I know how difficult adolescent depression is, but I also know that it doesn't have to control your life.|`|odoFOmwsaa	Aww I hope everything gets better for you :)  I had depression, still do but not as bad.

I cut for three years..THREE WASTED YEARS. You will regret it. You don't have to pretend to be happy. The one thing that really helped me climb over the wall of depression was God. If you are part of a different relationship I am not trying to convert you I'm just trying to help. Having a relationship with God shows me how much i am worth.  You are worthy.  Jesus died on the cross for YOU.  You have to get over the fact that you are not loved because IT IS SATAN LYING!!

Don't say anything, and see how your mum responds.    Next, try a different youth counsellor. Find someone you can talk to openly and honestly about all your feelings.   DON'T keep things bottled up!  Or you'll feel like you're about to explode...    Then when your thoughts bubble up - suddenly you find you can express how you're feeling - write those thoughts down. You'll then be able to understand yourself, and your negative views, much more clearly.    Try to define what each problem is, rather than bunch them altogether.  EG. If you over-eat because you are lonely, and that comforts you, then you need to find a way to make friends, that involves activity, and understand about what foods to avoid i.e. white bread, cakes, chocolate with lots of sugar, fried food etc.    You can tackle problems, one by one, taking small steps.    Finally, you should speak to someone at your school to explain your absence/s, perhaps requesting the help of your health visitor.

When you next see them, try not to put on the brave front. They are there only to help you, and you should not feel embarrassed to tell them anything.  It's hard because you instinctively do not want to tell people secrets, but councilors are sworn to secrecy, and you can be 100% sure that nothing said in the room will ever, ever leave it.    You should really try to start going to school every day. This will ensure straight away that your life can only go up!  This will enable you to gain more friends and give you a distraction from whatever is depressing you.  Try not to get cross with all the work at school, or when you are told off by the teachers for not doing something. This is very good as it will mean that you are getting back to a normal life, and put you back into a normal mindset.  Try not to force yourself on new friends in an attempt to get a new social life as quickly as you can, but try not to seem timid! Walk into each classroom with confidence and a smile, this will put other people at their ease and make them see that you have got it together!  In this way you will be able to start making now friends naturally.    Stop using Facebook and delete any Myspace or Bebo accounts. This will help a lot towards cleaning your slate and starting again.  Later of course, you may want to start up another account and that is fine, because you will not have any memories on it of your past life.    Having all these new interests will distract you from eating all the time, and keep you out from under your parents feet. Home life can begin to become more peaceful, take charge of yourself and make yourself the one to prevent arguments before they happen. Try to keep the same positive outlook at home as you now do at school!    Hopefully this can give you a good idea of a way to pick yourself back up and get going again!  Remember, wipe the slate clean.  Good luck and lots of hugs, luv Turrabo|`|6pbRCKkraa	you really need to tell your councillor everything, i know what its like cutting yourself i have done it in the past, think of it like this though one day you will meet someone and there gona ask what the scars are from and your gona feel embaresed, but you really should tell your councillor everything. and as for your family ignor them they dont understand what your going through, tell your councillor everything it will make you feel better, hope i helped in some way.

[ LOTS of pus may come out.]  2] clean it with a Qtip and peroxide  3] apply antibiotic ointment and a bandage.  Should be a lot beter in two days - keep treating til it looks 'normal'.

Once an infection is that bad it probably needs to be drained by the doctor (don't try it at home!) and also you will need antibiotics of some sort to get rid of the infection.

yJHOFmqVaa	Per my optometrist, it's nothing to worry about.  It happens as the result of UV exposure and or extreme cold.  There is no drug that will make it go away.  It will eventually go away on it's own.  The only thing to watch is if it spreads into the colored part of your eye.  Then you should go see your eye doctor.  It's called pingueculum.

552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	Ringworm (also called serpigo) is a skin infection, characterized by a reddish to brownish raised or bumpy patch of skin that may be lighter in the centre, giving the appearance of a ring. Ringworm can occur anywhere on the body. Depending on its location, it is also known as tinea pedis or "athlete's foot" when on the feet, tinea cruris or "jock itch" when on the groin area, tinea corporis when on the body (where it is most commonly referred to as ringworm), or tinea capitis when on the scalp.[1] Contrary to its name, ringworm is caused not by a worm but by a parasitic fungus and is medically classified as a dermatophytosis.    Fungi are organisms that survive by eating plant or animal material. Those that cause parasitic infection (dermatophytes) feed on keratin, the material found in the outer layer of skin, hair, and nails. These fungi thrive best on skin that is moist, hot, and hidden from the light. It is estimated that up to twenty percent of the population is infected by ringworm or one of the other dermatophytoses at any given moment.[citation needed]    Misdiagnosis and treatment of ringworm with a topical steroid can result in tinea incognito, a condition where ringworm fungus will grow without typical features like a distinctive raised border.    Contents   1 Differential diagnosis   2 Prevention   3 Diagnosis   4 Treatment   5 See also   6 References   7 Notes   8 External links           Differential diagnosis  Ringworm can be mistaken for one of the following conditions: granuloma annulare, discoid lupus, and sarcoidosis. Bullous tinea pedis (athlete foot with blisters) can mimic bullous drug reactions, bullous pemphigoid, and other bullous diseases of the skin. If suspected ringworm does not respond to routine antifungal treatment, further diagnostics must be performed, like a skin biopsy, a fungal culture, or a skin scraping for fungus identification.       Prevention  Fungi thrive in moist, warm areas, such as locker rooms and swimming pools, and in skin folds. The fungi may be present without any symptoms.    Advice often given to prevent ringworm includes:    Avoidance of sharing clothing, sports equipment, towels, or sheets.   Washing clothes in hot water with fungicidal soap after suspected exposure to ringworm.   Avoidance of walking barefoot, wearing of appropriate protective shoes to the beach and flip-flops/thongs in locker rooms.[2][3][4][4]   After being exposed to places where the potential of being infected is great [5], washing with an antibacterial and anti-fungal soap or one that contains Tea Tree Oil, which contains terpinen-4-ol.      Diagnosis  See also: dermatophyte   With skin scraping and rapid microscopic identification with potassium hydroxide preparation.    With fungal culture and species identification. Might take 2 to 3 weeks for result.    With DTM (dermatophyte testing medium). Result will take from 7 to 14 days.[6]      Treatment  Topically with antifungal agents such as terbinafine 1% cream (Lamisil) applied twice daily until symptoms resolve (usually 1-2 weeks). Terbinafine is not recommended for children     Systemically with oral medications, especially for scalp ring worm, or infection of the finger nails or toe nails.    This information should help...Most importantly seek a Dr.  Good Luck!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Go see a doctor.

umH9UXSYaa	I've had several HEPA filter units over the years due to my year-round pollen, dust and animal allergies. I had an Austin for about 5 years, and now have an IQAir HealthPro. The unit is on 24/7, at a fairly low speed because I don't want to be drowned out by it. My home office is also my bedroom, so I'm theoretically getting the benefits of it most of the day.    It's tricky trying to figure out how helpful the HEPA filter is. Overall, I'd guess it reduces my symptoms by maybe 20%. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the device is reduced every time you open up your door and let (fresh) air in.    I'd say that getting a HEPA air filter device would be worth trying, but unfortunately I'd doubt that it's going to help your nephew much. We have two cats (Maine Coon), and they have to stay at the other end of the house, behind two doors. This actually seems to work pretty well at reducing the amount of cat dander in the rest of the house. But if i go into the part of the house where they live, or they escape and run through the house, I can definitely tell.    Maybe you can try a few things? Keeping the cats out of several rooms of the house that your nephew will be using as well as the HEPA filter in his bedroom.    Is he using any antihistamine med or nasal spray? Chances are that if he has cat allergies he also has other allergies - dust mites, mold, pollen. There are good over-the-counter med options today - Zyrtec perhaps being the strongest non-sedating option. Good luck!|`|AA12316366	they help a little but the cost of filter's are pretty high. i also have an ionic breeze quadra where you just have to clean the filter but not sure of it's effectiveness|`|IaUtGtaTaa	I have been using one for 5 years now. At the beginning it was fantastic and we had no problems with allergies etc.(used at highest setting) We got a spare filter with the purifier which we replaced a few months later but when we went to buy another, the price of the replacement filter was too expensive for us so I just used cotton wool pleats which work to some extent. I wouldn't be without it though.  So I would say...go for it but save up for the filters.|`|d5aa461bdb5fa1bfd8158df539805abeaa	Even the cheap ones help.

AA11955868	I would wait a week to see if there is still any intense pain. It sounds like you just got a bruise and the blood pooled beneath the nail. You shouldn't worry about waiting because there's very little to do about broken toes unless it's visibly bent in the wrong direction. Go ahead and ice it to control swelling and pain.    Also, slap the toe stepper. That's just rude man.

c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	500 calories a day is dangerous to your health.  As others have mentioned, your body will go into starvation mode and you will hurt yourself and screw up your metabolism.  Try to stick with 1200 a day and get 30-60min of excercise.  You will lose weight.|`|c0ecfd9c0dc2333cceb9f6f88da9f142aa	That is too few calories.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	way to little, you'd feel starved and would go off your diet. You should have about 1000 cal a day to lose weight|`|xrTOhysRaa	That is definitely not enough. Your body might try to hold on to your fat because it thinks you are starving since you are eating so little. Eat more healthy foods and exercise regularly, and you should lose weight.|`|BKOzsKBlaa	way too little!!!  don't go under 1200 if you want to stay healthy and under no circumstance burn more than you're taking in.  my sister did and passed out at the top of the stairs leaving the gym!|`|Z7kP93Vqaa	U do realize that the weight your losing will come right back eh? Your messing with ur metabolism which means when u eat normal again which u HAVE TOO at some point unless u go anorexic. You should have about 1600 calories per day including if you exercise. Then since u have the right amount of calories then u will lose more weight that will stay off and u will have enough calories to develop muscle and make you thinner and toned. 500 is really not healthy :(|`|FGm3lluOaa	That is way too little calories for someone to consume. If you really want to loose weight, stick to eating the right foods. Drink lots of water and just exercise! The more weight you want to loose, the more exercise that you should do! Make sure you eat more than 1000 calories at least!!!!!!|`|BNqbOfBsaa	from experience i know that your body will live on 500 calories. Its not as bad as most people think. The thing is that your body will get used to the calorie drop sooner or later. And when it does your weight will stabilize a bit so you wont be loosing the weight as fast as you where the first week.      In the long run your metabolism will get slower.|`|TPpTAKAdaa	It's way too little.  To figure it out, check out this website:  http://ezinearticles.com/?How-Many-Calor...|`|9hSSocD0aa	YES!!!!! 500 is nothing.  you have to get at least  1500 calories. that would  be fine. but i would say  you should eat like 2000.  -XD|`|AA10358331	Uh.. yes! Eating around 1500-2000 calories is what your body needs to just make it through a day. If you want to lose a pound or two a week, just take away about 500 calories, not 1000. But since you are already around 1500 calories all you would need to add is exercise.|`|AdTnizwOaa	500 calories is not enough, you need more. Don't be afraid of those 'big numbers' you need 1000 more calories, that's the average diet. Don't stress out on calories, I don't and I'm not fat nor am i too skinny, i'm in the middle all I do is exercise and eat when i'm hungry and stop eating when i've had enough.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	Turns out that if you eat to little the body will give out. This diet will almost guarantee that you will end up with diabetes or something diet wrong. Just eat more often in smaller portions and you will be fine. Drink a glass of water before you eat like 10 minutes and drink a bunch of water everyday. If you are this worried you should see a doctor because you might have a eating disorder.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Way too little. You will screw up your body.|`|Q5KFND17aa	well your question isnt clear whether youre planning on having 500 calories a day or 1000, but either way you need more food than that.  if your weight bothers you that much, try exercise or something. If you hate exercise maybe join a gym and get some hot guy to be your personal trainer to make it a bit more fun. If working out isnt your thing, yeah you should eat better but if you just starve yourself like that you're gonna look and feel like sh*t and you'll gain everything back.|`|7ATa0AAhaa	stupid to even think that.|`|BcJpPMPFaa	You won't be able to function properly.  A 1200 cals/day is required, or your body will go into starvation mode, and you will just GAIN more weight.|`|8dMQqkfSaa	yeah it kinda is.  But maybe like 650 or something I thin that would be better.|`|vxTcvSYdaa	That's way too little! As a teenager, this is your body's crucial time to grow. Therefor, you need more calories! Here, try this website:    http://www.mypyramid.gov/mypyramid/index...    It will calculate your age and activity level, and a healthy food pyramid for you. Honestly, you shouldn't go below the calories it tells you. It may seem high, but if you follow the foodgroups and etc, its not that much at all!|`|avc7ixnxaa	You will be extremely malnourished and simply gain the weight right back when you start eating again. Instead, why don't you lose the weight in a more healthy way: diet and exercise. Your BMR is the absolute MINIMUM amount of calories that your body needs to function. If you exercise, you need even more calories. Why not try losing a pound a week. Please don't try and starve yourself. I was anorexic for two years and I was miserable. You're much better off losing weight the healthy way!
1oBilGHuaa	I don't think I want to think about whether I feel worse than someone else.  It makes me think of that question, "Can You Top This?"

Best Wishes.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Family is the main thing. friends will come later.|`|AA11543924	You don't say if you're being treated for this, or how. If not, that'd be your first step, but if your are already it clearly isn't working so a different approach is needed. Once you've got that underway the next step is to leave the house, even if it's just going to the shops, walking the dog, doing chores, etc. Talk to your family so you're regularly communicating with others. Then work on going out socially so you can make some new friends and ease your isolation.  I know things seem bleak now, but it will get better. :)|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Actually, maybe so.  I have tourette's in additon to social anxiety, sensor issues, ADHD and OCD.  The Tourette's, in me, is quite sever.  I can barely speak or walk at times due to my body's urges to do other, pointless things such as flap, convulse, squat or hop on one foot.    I don't have any real connections with other people and for the most part, I'm glad to spend time alone.  You sound like you've got Asperger's syndrome, or you could actually be mildly autistic.  Look into this.  Getting a diagnosis helped me accept myself and the way I act, think and even how I look.  (my face isn't perfectly symetrical, a tendency of people with autism due to their brain being a little crooked in its position in their skulls.)  But you can do this.  Don't give up.

749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa	Yes, but like all things done to lose weight, you have to do it like you mean it.    I mean, I see a lot of people buy a treadmill and say, "Ok, this weight-loss goal has just gotten serious!" but then all they do is walk on the thing at like 2 mph. That leisurely pace will not make anyone lose anything.     You have to participate with effort.|`|c9f2a1b3d1f4937e76dfc5f19e0e903daa	I was a swimmer in high school and was never thinner.

BhFeii5Xaa	Depending on the size of the wart, It can hurt like the very dickins! Small ones with minimal freezing don't hurt very long, but larger ones that take longer do hurt and need to be re-treated several times to really get rid of them.    I really wish the dude who says Plantar Warts go away were right!! Yes they are a virus, but NO they don't go away unless you have them removed.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	The novocaine shot hurts really, really bad.  They jab a massive needle directly into the side of your wart.    Then, the area goes completely numb, and you get to watch the doc cut out your wart painlessly.  He is literally cutting it out with a knife, but you don't feel anything.  It might gross you out.    The thing is, Plantar's warts go away in time.  It usually takes about a year.  Doctors don't tell you this because they want to charge you for surgery.  The doctor that diagnoses the wart is also the one who cuts it out ... so there is a huge conflict of interest.  He has incentive to tell you that you need your wart cut out when you don't.      Trust me, I've had a wart cut out.    Then, my brother, myself, and a couple of friends of mine have all had warts on our feet that we didn't get cut out.  They just went away.  A Plantar's wart is actually a virus.  Viruses run their course and go away eventually ... like the common cold.    The only good reason for having a wart cut out is that it is affecting your walking ... or annoying you when you play sports, and you need it out very soon.

xuV1xsImaa	I have a really bad stomach acid problem so i know 1st hand how these products work. I have used Pepto, and Tums. And those actually seem to upset my stomach more right at first. The geltabs also have the same effect.     What works best for me is Pepcid Maximum Strength pills. They are expensive but you can get a store brand for less than half the price with the same effectiveness.    Is your stomach acid cause by stress or anxiety? I was prescribed Librax (i get the generic and it is only $10) And that stuff works wonders on me! As long as you take as prescribed (twice a day) then your stomach problems could disappear. The medicine actually reduces the production of acid in your stomach.    I would assume that these medicines work differently for each person and if there is an underlying issue as to why you have increased stomach acid. I have been battling this issue for years so i know your pain. Hopefully you will find something that works!|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Don't eat heavy carbo. foods at the same time as protein. E.g.

That is terrifying, I know. Do your arms feel "heavy"?      If you have told your doctor these symptoms, and he didn't have you wear a holter monitor for 24 hours, I would see another doctor ASAP. Holter is warranted, NO pain involved, and monitors your heart rhythm for a 24 hour period. It is a marvelous test.  If you are having these spells several times a day, it will diagnose you immediately.    MOST arrythmias are just a nuisance. I lived with a very fast heart rhythm for over 20 years, before I had a minor surgery to get rid of it. My heart rate would go to 200-250 and then back to normal.    Another diagnostic tool...... does it take off very quickly?? I mean like go from a resting rate to a 130 rate really fast? Like a race horse out of the gate?? With SVT (supraventricular tachy) that is how it acts.  Then it stops just as quickly, with some rather sporadic beats just before it goes back to normal.    Hang in there. DONT let it freak you out.  BUT, do pursue it!  See another doc, or ask your doc for a holter monitor.    Best of luck to you!|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	whats your fluid intake like? do you pppppp clear? dehydration is the biggest flaw adults have too much caffeine so  limit caffeine, try gatorade , anxiety attack, rx medication cause heart issues? go to er next spell ,herbal supplements ? st johnswort? street drugs? my 20 yr son had echo cardiogram tue..

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women.

iK3YYRaTaa	How much protein does my body need?<br>  The amount of protein needed by your body depends on your activity level with a minimum of 0.36g/lb (0.8g/kg) and a maximum of 0.91g/lb (2.0g/kg) of body weight. The recommended maximum percentage of protein in our diet is 30% of total calories.<br>  <br>  How much protein is converted to glucose?<br>  It is generally believed that about 55% of protein is converted to glucose within 3-4 hours of being eaten and that fat has little effect on blood glucose levels. However, according to recent studies, very little protein or fat is converted to glucose. In addition, protein does not slow down the absorption or glucose response of a carbohydrate-dense meal. Fat delays the peak but not the total glucose response. So increasing the amount of protein and fat in our diet looks like a viable means of controlling postprandial glucose responses; however, this doesn't mean that a high-fat or high-protein diet is warranted. <br>  <br>  The same studies alluded to above also indicate that, over the long term, high-fat and high-protein diets may induce insulin resistance! Another study indicates that monounsaturated fatty acids (found mostly in vegetable and nut oils such as olive, peanut, and canola) can improve insulin resistance (when calories from fat are less than 37% of total calories). >|`|kNhnwftoaa	There's really no limit on how much protein you can intake.  What your body cannot use it will dispose of.  Protein in your diet as a diabetic is essential.  It is especially important to eat protein along with your carbohydrates at the same time.  The protein prevents your blood sugar from spiking.  It makes your blood glucose distribute more evenly which is so much better for your body.|`|9OsjUed2aa	Protein is very good for people with diabetes and an essential nutrient for everyone.  I am not aware of a limit on protein, in fact, I've had Type I and my husband has Type II and we eat a high protein, very low carb diet to normalize our blood sugars and we're also losing weight.<br>  <br>  What I do know is that you should consume the same amounts each day, for example, if you have 8 ounces of protein for lunch, always go for the same 8 ounces for every lunch.  30% of the protein you eat is converted to carbohydrate.  <br>  <br>  Your insulin requirements will probably decrease as you eat more protein and less carbohydrate and do weights.  Work with your doctor and keep track of your bg levels - low blood sugar sucks so be prepared!<br>  <br>  Sounds like you're doing good things!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  BB|`|Df3gXIykaa	i asked the same question a few days ago! i did alot of "googlin" on the subject and found that protein is beneficial for diabetics but i was lookin because i heard that you dont want too much protein, how much too much is im not sure, but im definitely gonna ask the doc, so i can start building muscle, i will let you know when i find out

The scientific name for these white globs is tonsilloliths.|`|pyBHdJ90aa	It's a tonsil stone.  Squish it and it will smell like death.

RvSHQtrXaa	No really.  But why worry for an injection discomfort.  The reason for that shot is more important than a stick.<br>  <br>  My recommendation ask the nurse or your doctor to use a very sharp needle.  A sharp needle is a wonder when being stuck.  You almost feel nothing.  A not-so sharp one can be a bit painful or cramping.  Also remember, please ask that health provider if he or she did not, to use a antiseptic or alcohol to wipe the little area where the stick should go, and, to slightly rub the area after the injection.  Rest awhile too after the stick.  You'll be fine, as the problem is not the stick but relieving the cause of the stick.  Bye, and wish you well.|`|68l1TeDjaa	its gonna hurt like hell. a lot of shots in the butt? oh yea. im sorry. i dont know what your getting shots for, but good luck.|`|xmibEEdcaa	Yes, it's going to hurt, but it's still surely much better than whatever you're getting the shots to fix.<br>  <br>  Try not to tense up your butt muscles while you're getting the shots, even if you're nervous. Keeping those muscles relaxed will make it hurt less.|`|Y7CGMwodaa	If its a penicilin shot, then yes, it will hurt.

I'm not saying that to be nice.  I'm saying it because it is true.  See the Ideal Weight Chart link in the Source box below.  Now, aside from that...<br>  Skipping meals is unhealthy for 2 reasons.<br>  1.  You are not getting the nutrition your body needs.  Your bones may become brittle, your hair can begin to fall out, your skin may become dry, etc.  The look that malnutrition can bring to your appearance is much worse than extra pounds!  (If you had extra pounds, which you don't.)<br>  2.  Skipping meals slows your metabolism WAY down.  In order to lose weight, you have to burn calories.  The higher your metabolism, the more calories your body burns. Once you stop feeding yourself, your body freaks out and hangs on to every ounce of fat it can in order to keep you alive.|`|8w5HAnE4aa	whoa whoa whoa, back up, you think you are FAT!?!?! dont worry you are completely normal! it might make you drop a couple of pounds, but it wont last, and you will get hungry, and your stomach will growl at you.

Not eating won't help you lose weight because your body only burns the amount of calories to consumes. So if i were you and wanted to lose weight I'd start eating, very important and then just exercise before  meals so it burns the fat you already have instead of the food you're consuming. get it? I'm 5'2 as well and weigh 114. By best friend is a little taller but even skinnier then me and weighs even more then me because she's has lots of muscle and that weighs more then fat, so don't really worry about how much you weigh on the scale, and really you're not fat for you're height.|`|arBtc97naa	okayy first of all you are not fat, at all!<br>  the average weight for a 14 year old is<br>  about 125-130 pounds. but if you want<br>  to exercise a little bit to stay healthy<br>  start with daily walks. skipping meals<br>  is the wrong answer. it slows down your<br>  metabolism a lot. also when you sleep<br>  your body goes into hybernation (sleep mode),<br>  so you have to eat when youuu wake up (breakfast).<br>  If you dont eat breakfast, when you do eat<br>  the food goes straight to the fat storage in<br>  your stomach. thats why people try to stress<br>  that breakfast is good for you. also, if skipping<br>  meals, you will be very tired and mal nourished.<br>  you wont be able to concentrate in school or<br>  anything. you will become very tired and lazyy<br>  often. if this continues, you may develop an<br>  eating disorder, those are no fun. hope<br>  this helps you out a little bit.|`|fdelyVYJaa	Read: How to eat less to lose weight and not to be hungry <br>  from <a href="http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/01/how-to-eat-less-to-lose-weight-and-not.html" rel="nofollow">http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a>|`|SA3RIkbyaa	wow, if you're fat, then im obese. im 5'5 and weigh 133 currently (but i already know im fat)<br>  but you are actually fine for you height and weight.|`|p2kxozIhaa	Hun sounds like you have an eating disorder. I mean i'm 5 ft 4 and i weight 145 and i wouldn't consider myself fat.  Maybe fluffy but not fat.  don't starve yourself but eat healthy. YOu'll burn far more calories by eating things like fruits and veggies.  By starving yourself your metabolism shuts down and won't burn as much as if you were eating but eating veggies and fruits to keep your metabolism working.
OIOebJyIaa	Since you think it would not blow over well to ask your mom to buy it, I'm guessing you don't know what the causes are and think she'll assume its because you're having unprotected sex or something.  Here's a list from brown.edu of different causes:<br>  <br>  Antibiotic treatments <br>  Oral contraceptives <br>  Hot weather or non-ventilating clothing, which increase moisture and warmth, fostering fungal growth <br>  Repeated intercourse over a short period of time <br>  Stress <br>  Suppressed immune system (including HIV) <br>  High carbohydrate intake, especially refined sugars and alcohol <br>  Pregnancy <br>  Diabetes <br>  Other causes can be irritants such as soaps, powders, new detergents and other products<br>  <br>  So yes, ask your mom for monistat.  Or, if you've taken antibiotics recently, start eating yogurt.  Antibiotics cause yeast infections.  Replacing the beneficial digestive system bacteria makes them go away.|`|7imSDvmpaa	You have to go buy a monistat its really the only over the counter medication that you can take without a RX. I also do not think there is a age limit to be able to buy the medication. Also tell your mom and hopefully she will be supportive she should be. Also get some AZO Yeast pills, take like 3 day day until the pain goes away it helps and use Johnson&Johnson diaper rash cream for the pain for now and drink water and cranberry juice alot of it too! **** Luck.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com|`|A8k9NHigaa	buy some monistat|`|CadIYXdXaa	Your mother shouldn't give you trouble for a yeast infection, you can get them from things as simple as wearing tight jeans alot or from antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, LOTS of water, I think cranberry juice helps too, and clean your vagina really well with a mild soap and water as usual on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Your system should re-balance itself out, if not talk to your mom.<br>  Also, you don't have to be older to buy stuff at the drugstore, you just need the money.|`|8Hdt5wjYaa	The best thing you can possibly do is suck it up and talk to your parents.  You might be surprised how supportive your mother is.  If you really do have a yeast infection you need to get it treated as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  I'm a little confused as to why you think it'd be hard to speak with your mother about this?<br>  <br>  Is it because you got this from being sexually active??  <br>  <br>  Honestly, if you think you're old/mature enough to be "doing the deed" then you better grow up and realize that with the fun comes consequences.  If you are "mature" enough to be active then you darn well should be "mature" enough to speak to your parents about this.|`|1PL5WLpHaa	There are no good home remedies for a yeast infection.  And besides, you haven't been properly diagnosed as having a yeast infection.  It could be something even more serious than that.  Go ahead and tell your mom that you are in pain and uncomfortable, and let her know that you need some kind of treatment.  Let her be the judge of if you can afford it (and btw, emergency room charges can usually be deferred if you don't have insurance or the means to pay).|`|kZXZfpr2aa	ok..this will sound gross but trust me it works. you will have to spend some money. buy plain/unfavored natrual yogurt from the grocery/whole foods store. coat your finger an insert where you have the yeast. the natrual enzimes in the yogurt destroys yeast/a type of fungus...you can also rub the yogurt where you have the itching. hope this helps...good luck. note. you should do this daliy for about 2weeks, do not have sex or douche, until you are sure the yeast is gone...it can become a std if you have sex.|`|LuND86GIaa	I can't actually help besides ( It is a wives tale dunno if it's true but i heard plain yogurt actually fights the infection but I would not reccommed trying that until you talk to a doctor, so good luck :)   )|`|XvjfvGohaa	i know they sell some stuff at cvs or walgreens or any kind of store like that... it's a kit and you apply stuff down there and it gets rid of it.|`|e8SgYE0Oaa	This is alot but it will help for sure:<br>  <br>  Wear breathable, loose clothing.<br>  Many yeast infections are caused or further irritated by tight, synthetic (unbreathable) undies, stockings, pants, etc., which trap in heat and moisture, allowing natural yeast bacteria to go forth and multiply into a full-blown yeast infection. Balance out the yeast levels in your crotch by wearing clean cotton underwear, avoiding tight clothing, and even daring to go commando.<br>  <br>  Keep your crotch clean and dry.  This may be a major “duh”, but one of the best ways to treat a yeast infection is to wash yourself thoroughly at least once a day. Use soap without excessive dyes or scents, and dry your crotch afterwards with a cool, clean cotton cloth or towel. This will soothe the irritating symptoms of a yeast infection, as well as hinder further yeast growth.<br>  <br>  Avoid chemicals that may irritate or worsen a yeast infection. The inks, dyes, and perfumes found in crotch-contacting tampons, condoms, hygiene sprays, soap, toilet paper, laundry detergent, clothing, and fabric softener can trigger infections. Watch for patterns of vaginal irritation and yeast infections when using such products, and try using all-natural, environmentally friendly alternatives.<br>  <br>  Over-the-counter lotions, creams, and suppositories may be the most effective way to fight a yeast infection. Products such as Monistat 7, Vagistat, and Femstat all use one of four active anti-fungal ingredients (nitrate, butoconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, and tioconazole) to break down the Candida fungus and restore healthy yeast levels.|`|k11IhJGYaa	You should definitely talk to your Mom.  Lots of women get yeast infections, and just because you have one doesn't mean you will be in trouble for doing something maybe you shouldn't have.  Sex CAN cause a yeast infection, but that's not always the culprit.  I don't really know of a home remedy for this; however, if you have plain yogurt, you can put some on/in.  i know it's gross, but my sister did this once b/c she didn't have the money for a cream, and she swears that it worked for her.  The only other suggestion I have is to soak in a warm, soapy bath as often as you can.  Sometimes this helps me ward off a yeast infection. <br>  <br>  HTH and Good luck|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	You can use this home remedy, it's great:<br>  Take a few cloves of garlic and blend them with warm water in your blender.  Strain the liquid (use cheesecloth or any clean white cloth), then use it as a douche.  Let it go inside and be sure to let the outside be rinsed with it also.  It has a neutralizing effect, stops the discomfort and puffiness quickly.<br>  I've done this before, more than once.<br>  I won't spend $$ for yeast infection ever again.<br>  (and no, you won't smell like garlic! It wears off soon.)|`|kjW1fmmPaa	If there were an easy, reliable, at-home cure, companies like Monostat and Vagisil would be out of business.  They sell so much because there is no simple, homemade cure for it.  You really should go to a doctor, as that's what is recommended for first-timers, but if you're really sure it's a yeast infection and you don't have insurance, then you can just go to Walmart or a pharmacy and buy it off the shelf there.<br>  <br>  What do you mean when you say it would not blow over well? Your mom is a woman too, chances are she has had a yeast infection in her life too and knows how irritating they are.  You can talk to her about it, although it will be awkward.  You can just ask  for some money to pick up "girl stuff" at Walmart, and if she asks what you mean, you can tell her Monostat or you can just say tampons or something.  If she wants to drive you to Walmart, you can ask her to wait in the car, tell her you're too embarrassed and want to just go in alone and get it over with.  Or if she comes into the store with you, just tell her you want to get it yourself because it's too embarrassing to have your mother shop for "girl stuff"/tampons/whatever your excuse is, with you.<br>  <br>  Just go ahead and get it over with, the sooner you get the medication, the better! Once you get rid of this one, work at preventing future ones by eating yogurt, wearing cotton underwear, and keeping your vaginal area clean and as dry as you can.

UVnr7wrmaa	It's definitely periods. At first, it'll only be little, but then it gets worse. :(<br>  <br>  15 is a normal age to get your periods, so don't stress. And if you're on the swim team, you can't go swimming with pads, you'd need to get tampons. And I know they hurt, but if you enjoy swimming then there's really no other alternative... :(<br>  <br>  And don't worry, there's no need to be terrified. Periods happen to every woman, it should stop around the age of 40, but until then, you've just got to find a quick, easy way of dealing with it. And who knows? It might not be very heavy for you. It's different for everyone.<br>  <br>  And just because you aren't getting cramps, doesn't mean you don't have periods. Everyone is unique, and the same goes for periods. No one's the same. Some people get period pains and headaches, etc, and some others just get their periods without warning, and there's not a lot they can do about it, either. <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped you, and don't stress, you're just as normal as the rest of us. :)|`|9bsYmkV3aa	Yep, you'll probably start your period in a day or two. This is usually normal--at least for me it is.

So basically the pain will eventually go and as long as you train your hand back into its normal regime, it should be fine except for a slightly bigger hand.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps : )

AA10299265	It's a good idea to check your glucose levels now and then if you are at risk for diabetes. Risk factors include being overweight, leading a sedentary lifestyle, and if there are any diabetic blood relatives. Since hypothyroidism slows the metabolism, I would think that might be a factor also. <br>  <br>  At any rate, fasting glucose levels should be between 80 and 110 mg/dl (4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l). Two hours after a meal, the glucose level should not exceed 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). Above 200 (11.1) is diabetic, and between 140 and 200 is prediabetic, borderline, impaired glucose tolerance... there are many names for it, but suffice to say, anything over 140 means you're on your way toward becoming diabetic.<br>  <br>  To satisfy curiosity, you could check a couple of times a day for a week. If you're numbers fall within the normal range, you can probably put the meter away. Then, bring it out maybe once every six months, or so.

3QIWdvG1aa	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory illness that first infected people in parts of Asia, North America, and Europe in late 2002 and early 2003. SARS is caused by a type of coronavirus, a family of viruses that often cause mild to moderate upper respiratory illness, such as the common cold. This virus is known as SARS-CoV.<br>  <br>  Experts believe SARS may have first developed in animals because the virus has been found in civets—a catlike wild animal that is eaten as a delicacy in China—and other animals.1 In the first outbreak, 8,096 people became sick with SARS and 774 died<br>  <br>   Like most respiratory illnesses, SARS is spread mainly through contact with infected saliva or droplets from coughing. You cannot get SARS from brief, casual exposure to an infected person, such as passing someone on the street. You need to be near someone [less than 3 ft (1 m)] or have close contact to become infected. Close contact includes living with or caring for a person who has SARS or breathing in air that an infected person exhaled. Outbreaks of SARS do not appear to be seasonal.<br>  <br>  An infection may develop after:<br>  <br>      * Sharing food or drink with an infected person.<br>      * Hugging or kissing a person with SARS.<br>      * Talking to an infected person who is within 3 ft (1 m) of you.<br>      * Getting the tiny droplets on your hands by touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.<br>  <br>  It is possible SARS can be transmitted in other ways, such as by touching objects that are contaminated with feces from an infected person. This could happen if people do not wash their hands after using the bathroom.<br>  <br>  The disease does not appear to spread from a mother to her baby at birth.1<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The main symptoms are a fever higher than 100.4° (38°), a dry cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. A person with SARS also may experience a headache, muscle aches, a sore throat, fatigue, and diarrhea. Older people may feel generally unwell (malaise) and lose their appetite but not have a fever.1 For some people the symptoms get worse quickly, making hospitalization necessary.<br>  <br>  The incubation period—the time from when a person is first exposed to SARS until symptoms appear—is usually 3 to 7 days but may be as long as 10 days. Experts believe a person can spread the illness to others only while he or she has symptoms. As a precaution, however, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who have SARS stay home, except for doctor visits, until 10 days after their symptoms have gone away.<br>  How is SARS diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Your doctor may suspect SARS if you have a fever higher than 100.4° (38°)and you have either traveled to a SARS-affected area or been around a person who has SARS within the past 10 days.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may order several tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. A chest X-ray may be done if you are short of breath or coughing. A blood sample, sputum sample, or nasal swab may be done to detect bacteria or viruses. Your doctor may suspect that you have SARS if tests rule out any other cause for your symptoms, especially if you had contact with someone who has SARS or you traveled to an area experiencing a SARS outbreak. In this case, blood tests may be done to detect substances in your blood (antibodies) that form to fight the SARS virus.<br>  <br>  You will need at least two tests for antibodies done on separate days to confirm an infection. You also may have tests to detect the genetic material (RNA) of the SARS virus. However, RNA testing is not available everywhere.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  Severe cases of SARS often require hospitalization, especially if breathing problems develop. You will be placed in isolation to prevent passing the disease to others. Various medications—including corticosteroids and the antiviral medication ribavirin—have been used to treat SARS, but no medication is known to cure the illness. Doctors continue to search for an effective treatment. One early study showed that the antiviral medication interferon alfacon-1, taken along with corticosteroids, may help in the treatment of SARS by increasing the amount of oxygen in the blood.3<br>  <br>  About one-third (33%) of the people with SARS become ill and then recover.4 The illness gets worse in two-thirds (67%) of the people and is likely to lead to hospitalization.<br>  <br>  The risk of dying from SARS depends on a person's age and health. The greatest risk is to people older than 65 and those with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease. About 9 in 10 people infected with SARS recover; about 1 in 10 dies.5, 6<br>  How can I avoid being infected with SARS?<br>  <br>  The best way to prevent the spread of SARS is to avoid areas where there is an outbreak and avoid contact with people who may be infected. You can also reduce your risk of infection by washing your hands often with soap or alcohol hand cleaners. If an outbreak occurs, try to avoid large pub|`|IKakoOfyaa	SAR is medical shorthand for sarcosinemia, a rare metabolic disorder where the blood level of sarcosine in increased due to a deficiency of sarcosine dehydrogenase which is needed to break it down. It is considered a harmless condition with no noticeable symptoms.<br>  <br>  SARS is severe acute respiratory syndrome, a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus.  The main way that SARS seems to spread is by close person-to-person contact. The virus that causes SARS is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

L3Tc39cuaa	hi, i was diagnosed with bpd over 15 years ago- and have suffered ever since. i think the best way you can try and deal with it is learn to manage your behaviour, and emotions. this takes lots of hard work-and unfortunately no-one can do it for you. your thinking patterns may never change (hopefully for u they will) so try and learn to understand your emotions- why u feel that way? are there causes from the past. try and make sense of it yourself.  I dont think you can ever fully get a professional to understand you-u are just too complex and all the answers are inside you. my advice is read as much as you can about the condition and try and attach meaning to your own life events and thoughts. I know you have said youll have to do this by yourself but keep knocking on doors, keep asking for support.  If they say no the first ten times the next person might just help and feeling you are supported and someone acknowledging your problems is very important even if theres not a great deal they can pratically do for you. Try medication - it may help with your symptoms, but you are still you, and i believe you have to understand yourself before you can deal with your emotions more appropriately to allow you to continue with life (jobs,relationships etc).hope this helps.goodluck and bestwishes x|`|pl96lkzIaa	I have a very good friend with BPD.

4qT0TfMZaa	ECT is limited to those psychiatric patients with profound clinical depression.  It is done under general anesthesia with an MD anesthetist and an MD psychiatrist and nurses in attendance.  The patient is totally unaware of what's happening.  It is not a procedure for adolescents.  It is done only at the direction of an MD psychiatrist with prior review by the hospital's medical review board.  It will not be considered for you.|`|ifwgd5dMaa	ECT was a popular form of therapy in the 50s and 60s, but has generally been discredited since that time.  In the modern 21st century viewpoint, it's as close to torture as you can get and still call it medicine.  The basic theory is that if you overload the brain's circuits, you can "reset" them to be "correct."  It was a caveman with a club trying to do surgery.    It was a bad idea that assumed many incorrect things about the human body, brain, and psyche.  Psychotherapy, low-security institutionalization with a "rehab" focus, and medication are all readily available much safer and more widely accepted options for whatever psychological and physical issues you might be having.    As for being a minor, you would certainly need parental approval for anything as dangerous as ECT.    And just as one last unprofessional note.  What's it like?  You know how they used to use electrocution to kill people?

When a person injures themselves endorphins are released in the body and function as natural pain killers  The behavior may become addictive because the person learns to associate the act of self-injury with the positive feelings they get when endorphins are released in their system  The use of SSRI medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as Prozac and Zoloft, may be helpful in increasing brain serotonin levels and reducing self-injury in cases of moderate to severe depression
8vfCRg7Caa	eat right, and work out right. i used to be in wrestling and i witnessed people lose like 5 pounds in a day or so. just to make weight for wrestling. Running helps, but the key is be consistant. Eat right and lift weights the right way. If you have to and you have the money get a trainer. They are worth it.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Reduce your intake of fat in your diet. You need some fats so 25-50grams should be plenty. And make them healthy like from olive oil, avocado, nuts & seeds (and salmon or tuna if you eat fish).     Cardio is good for burning fat. Try running intervals on a treadmill or elliptical. Start with 2.5min of moderate effort followed by 30seconds of going at it 100%. Repeat this 10 times and you have your 30min session. As you build endurance, lengthen the max effort part and reduce the recovery part. At the end you should be doing 2.5min max effort w/30seconds recovery.|`|rP1WwvnVaa	Running will definitely help, along with any other cardio exercises.  Make sure you exercise for at least 30 minutes about 4 times a week.  Also, you should do some weight training because muscle will help boost your metabolism.  Lastly, eat healthier.  Cut back on calories, fats, and sugars, and focus more on eating fruits, veggies, and protein.      It takes time to lose that much fat.  If you lose it too quickly, you will just gain it all back, SO TAKE YOUR TIME!!!|`|kX1PolCUaa	eat food with high calorie:fat ratio so you get energy with the minimum of fat. exercise more and eat less =]|`|X3wHGhyWaa	Yes running will definitely help. However you need to eat properly.  Depends on a lot of things. If you can cook, get a book by MAt Roberts , has some nice recepies.   Now.  I am sure you wil get lots of answers. They key is planing. Your Body loves consistency. You have to stay consistent with whatever u decide to do ..results come in 3 months. If you are 35%...6 months but after a while it becomes harder to loose.  1. First aim to loose fat  2.Hopefully keep your muscle   3. Then Tone up    1. The best way is to exrcise on an empty stomach either in the morning or late at night after 2-3 from when u have dinner.    2. Stop eating too many Carbohydrates. Reduce them gradually to the point where u are eating maximum a cup of boiled brown rice a day..  Cut oily foods. Eat more fish, less red meat and burgers, Vegetables and carrot juice help, or smoothies without dairy.    Stop eating Dairy. Chocolate and sweets. (limit to once a week)    3. use dry Sauna followed by cold dip.    READ READ AND READ THERE IS SO MUCH INFO OUT THERE.|`|MwvA8v17aa	running will help over a period of time-  but 10% is unhealthy!  normal is 18-24%|`|d53f45d3bb8adf2aa6874ce40a77e40aaa	yes running will help. of course all that cardio will be aided by a good diet. eventually i strongly urge implementing weights. the added muscle will boost yout metabolism and help you shred unwanted fat storages.
AA11693263	Just to be on the safe side you should go see your doctor. You could have punctured your ear drum and that's not good. For pain use heat from a heating pad. Nothing wet until you find out what's going on. And take some Advil to help with the pain too. Good luck and call your doctor :)|`|BopBYwSdaa	I had that before... ear injection    inside area near ear normally won't hurt so assume it's a mid-ear before ear drum (lots of nerve and hurt a lot)... GO TO SEE EAR DOCTOR ... he will give you ear drop and clean out infection
uy6sBhipaa	No It's not bad. It's fairly normal for a lot of teenagers who have other things on their mind.  There is a world wide epidemic of obese people in the industrialized, 'modern' nations. As long as you eat when you feel hungry you're OK.  8>{)|`|t81MEJ82aa	Well you won't die tomorrow simply by not eating but it is not a healthy thing for your body if you do this all of the time. Your body needs fuel and nutrients consistently to function properly.|`|PZYOTy2Haa	Quite, but I guess it depends on how much lunch you had & how much exercise you're doing. But it's not reccommended to skip meals. It doesn't help you lose weight it just bloats you.
0WnZD5acaa	I get a burning tightening sensation in my chest that passes when I take Morphine but it is wise not to take it again until directed to do so by a doctor...    **************  Morphine side effects  Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:          shallow breathing, slow heartbeat;        seizure (convulsions);        cold, clammy skin;        confusion;        severe weakness or dizziness; or        feeling light-headed, fainting.    Less serious side effects are more likely to occur, such as:          constipation;        warmth, tingling, or redness under your skin;        nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite;        dizziness, headache, anxiety;        memory problems; or        sleep problems (insomnia).    This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Tell your doctor about any unusual or bothersome side effect.|`|AA11693263	Well, first of all, don't waste your time taking the pills back. They can't accept them or give you a refund. Are the pills you were prescribed extended release or time released? If so then when you cut up the pill you messed up the time release coating and all of the medication was put into your bloodstream at once. It's probably good that you only took 1/4 of it if that's the case. If your doctor hasn't called back yet you nee3d to call the pharmacy and let them know what medicine it was, that you cut it, and how much you took and how long ago and all the symptoms you are having. It could be pretty important that you get some medical advice from a professional asap. So, please call now. Good luck and the next time, call your pharmacist before you change the dosing instructions.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	yeah|`|AA10063059	have you eaten if not eat something now
g6Vci5SUaa	It could be related to carpel tunnel pain, believe it or not.  Sometimes you don't actually feel the pain in your wrist and hand, it effects the nerves that go up your arm to your shoulder blade.  It also could relate to tennis elbow.  Try exercises for carpel tunnel and see if that helps, as well as wearing a wrist splint at night.  You might want to consult with a pain specialist if these things don't help.  They will look for other reasons than bone or muscles.|`|AA11693263	Welcome to the world of "I have this pain and the doctor knows I have it but has no idea what it is so he makes me feel like it's really nothing". You have to go back to your doctor. Make him listen to your symptoms. Tell him this is affecting your daily life and that he needs to send you to a specialist. I have exactly the pain you have, mine started over 3 years ago. I have been under the care of my PCP, a neurologist, a rheumatologist and a pin management doctor. I have many more symptoms that all lead to what you think you have.....nerve damage. The only diagnosis I have gotten is that I have a Chronic Neurological condition and I have to take medication throughout the day to get relief from the pain. I use heat on my shoulder pain, it really helps. Either a hot shower, bath or heating pad.Also, try taking some Advil to relieve the pain and inflammation. I use the over the counter Advil that are 200mg a pill. It says to take 2 every 4-6 hours but I take 3 if I am in a lot of pain. The prescription ones are 800mg and work really well. I take a mild prescription medication called Ultram 4 times a day in addition to the Advil.   But like I said, in cases like this you almost have to force your doctor to help you and send you to a specialist. I wrote down all of my symptoms (it was a page and a half) and put it in front of my doctor a few months ago. I finally got sent to the right specialist and am now getting the proper testing to find out what is wrong. They now know and are just waiting for confirmation tests to start proper treatment. You are your best advocate. Don't let your doctor make you think it's nothing when you know it is. And if he just won't listen to you, switch doctor's until you find someone who does listen. You deserve to know what is wrong and to get the proper treatment to get you out of pain. Good luck and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. :)|`|b9f206363f25a7dac45f7f180e49ee6caa	nothing is wrong, just maybe your back is sensitive. try seeing a chiropractor. it helps me all the time, especially after i shovel snow.    good luck|`|qXCgeye3aa	sounds like one of your disks is out of place. i would recommend you going to a chiropractor, but these days, they dont know what they are doing. the tingle is from your nerve being pinched. i had this personally too, and i know this one man in Kentucky who knows what he is doing. he gave me a simple stretch/message, the disk went back in place,and i have never had that pain again. if you come to a last resort, you can get this bed/message table, its called NugaBest.look it up on youtube.com. it heats your back, and then begins to stretch it. the disk will go back into place and you wont have this problem anymore. its costly, but i think totally worth it. my grandma has it, and i tried it, it really works. my hubby also has back problems, we are going to be buying too.    good luck
o8ukGep5aa	Hey,<br>  First and formostly, you need to speak to someone - a trusted friend, a sibling, a kind teacher who has noticed your grades are slipping  - even just telling them about what you're going through might help a little. I highly recommend that, as with anyone who has suicidal feelings, you see your GP as soon as possible.  I think they are the best people to see as they know your history and can recommend what's best for you, whether you have depression or not.<br>  Making the first step of telling people and doing something about what's going on is really scary - I know, I've been there, and it took a right royal kick up the **** from someone who knew me well to realise I needed help.  I Admire your bravery, and I hope you can take that forward to getting some help. <br>  What I would like to emphasise is that suicidal feelings should *always* be taken seriously and treated with care, and referred to health professionals.  It is *not* attention seeking, it is the sign that something is the matter - however exactly what the matter is, I cannot answer, as I am not a health professional.<br>  I hope you get the help you need as soon as you can.  Hang in there and stay strong - you're doing well.|`|a0MgkDk0aa	I think you should see a therapist. If you don't, you know your just setting yourself up for death. Please, go get help. The same thing happened to me, and I went and got help. Now, I'm better than ever! Please, take my advice and get help, right *now*|`|xKoc55sEaa	I think you should go to a therapist or at least try talking to someone close to you.

(hopefully that doesn't sound to gay :P, and i totally understand if you never want to talk to me ever again, just the name scared me, im worried)|`|AA11004345	Take a long walk.  While you are at it try to look for the good things in life in your walk.  If you get hungry, take along a carrot or couple sticks of celery or an apple.  Good luck
nEVoabeSaa	After you take this product, it goes through your intestines and causes you to have a liquid stool (bowel movement). This cleans the body waste out of your colon so your doctor can clearly see the inside of your intestines.   So you keep drinking it until your intestine is empty, you should be passing brown liquid from your butt and once that liquid is 'clear' stop drinking. That is why your Doctor said to drink as much as you can, because once the bowel turns to brown liquid, you really do not want to drink anymore. Best of Luck
FicyC2TXaa	Nobody knows what causes breast cancer; if we knew that then prevention would be easy and a cure wouldn't be far behind.<br>  <br>  There are risk factors, but risk factors are not causes. For example, never having children is a breast cancer risk factor, but most women who never have children don't get breast cancer - it isn't a cause of breast cancer. In the same way, insurance companies regard 'being male' as a risk factor for having a car crash, but being male doesn't actually cause car crashes.<br>  <br>  A risk factor is just something that may increase your chances.<br>  <br>  Smoking and diet, which have both been mentioned here, are not recognised risk factors for breast cancer.<br>  <br>  The greatest risk factor is being female - over 99% of people diagnosed are female (and as far as I'm aware there's no increase in the numbers of men getting breast cancer).<br>  <br>  The second greatest risk factor is getting older; 80% of those diagnosed are over 50, and fewer than 0.1% are under 30.<br>  <br>  Only 5 - 10% of all breast cancer cases are hereditary.<br>  <br>  The other known risk factors are:<br>  <br>  <br>  Having children at an older age or not at all. The more children a woman has may also slightly lower her risk. Breast-feeding helps protect against the disease. The longer a woman breast feeds her children, the more she lowers her risk.<br>  <br>  Starting periods at a younger than average age (under 12) or having a late menopause (after 55)<br>  <br>  Taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) causes a small increase in risk. However, the risk gradually returns to normal after you stop taking them.<br>  <br>  Being overweight (especially after the menopause).<br>  <br>  Regularly drinking more than 1 unit of alcohol per day slightly increases the risk of breast cancer.<br>  <br>  Having a previous diagnosis of breast cancer increases the risk of developing a new cancer in the other breast.<br>  <br>  BUT, remember they're risk factors, not causes.<br>  <br>  Nobody knows what causes breast cancer|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Getting older and hormonal causes.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	The cause of breast cancer is the same as it is for all cancers - cumulative mutations in DNA that result in unchecked cell division. The risk factors for developing these mutations in your breasts include obesity, family history, smoking, age, genetic predisposition, radiation exposure, etc etc. However many people who develop it have few if any risk factors.<br>  <br>  For more info, look here: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cancer/DS00328/DSECTION=risk-factors" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-...</a>|`|uUsfXu1gaa	there are many factors that mat attribute towards breast cancer for example smoking poor diet i e eating too many MacDonalds lol  (dont worry i think were all quilty of that one) but one major factor is if one or more family members at that includes male members as well because  its been suggested male breast cancer is on the rise as well you could visit bacup which is a website that specifically deals with cancer you will gain a wealth of information on there if you enter www.bacup in the search bar you will get to it there good luck and dont worry|`|AA10302917	The truth don't nobody really knows.

H5NGXgqsaa	Well you are at least proclaiming NOT to be having a 'pity_party'...thats a good thing! Secondly you are willing to admit an unease with your present situation thus reaching out to others for advice/guidance~thats GREAT! Third, you are ABSOLUTELY accurate in saying that "it doesn't matter what others think or say about you"...TERRIFIC & a beneficial realization indeed! So you are halfway where you would like to possible go~  I suggest you take some time to look at yourself & honestly see the things that ARE GOOD about you...EVERYONE has positive & negative things about themselves whether it be habits/behavior/self-esteem etc... Try taking a pad of paper, make two columns...one listing all the POSITIVE & good things about you[no matter how small or irrevelant they may seem to you!]...then list the next column called NEGATIVE or unappealing/lacking things about yourself... After awhile...take some time a few days later to see what you actually wrote....just add to the list as your days go by...You may be surprised at what you see! Sometimes we are our own worst enemy...our worst critic even...BUT that does NOT mean we have to feel less important to others! One must first learn to like/love thyself before they can truly allow another to do so~ Keep that thought in mind...Make sure you take notice when someone offers a compliment...add it to your list~ BELIEVE it & accept compliments gracefully as well as constructive criticism openly! You are going to realize that many of us get down in the dumps, find little that our lives may exhibit as worth etc...BUT when one actually takes the time to 'fairly' evaluate the truths their lives entail[even though sometimes the truth hurts~] Such behavior could help set you free...with a newly generated feeling of wanting to face the world & travel the journey! Always rememeber that for every obstacle it is actually a stepping stone towards better opportunities! Take care~|`|s5Tg2M4paa	i can be ur friend :)|`|NYzRHMcoaa	well , try getting friends , get out from home , travel to other contries , GET A LIFE|`|6QDaqIXbaa	So go take a speech class, they teach you how to verbally confront people.

Why are people putting you down like that?  why do you degrade yourself so much.  You have to have a sense of self worth for you.  You're right about one, it doesn't matter what people say about you, but it does matter what you think about yourself.  Everyone has some endearing qualities about them,  You're no exception.  God doesn't make junk.  So come on, get out of the house.  Get a hobby, go for long walks, make new friends.  Stop saying you are pathetic.  The more you talk yourself into it, the worse it will get.  Perhaps you should seek counseling.  Just talk to someone and tell them how you feel.  You will see that you have a lot to offer in this world.  Feel better about yourself,  that's the beginning.
zNGWFKXGaa	Move your dinner time to 6pm when going to bed around midnight.     100-250 calories is definitively too little and your body will store these calories as reserve and not burn them as wished! Try to grill meat or fish just wth salt, pepper, olive oil in frying pan or on grill. Next to it have salad wth olive oil & balsamic vinagre or steamed veggies. Of course the portion should be a small one!     Don't drink while having your meals! You digest not as good!     Drinking water is good for the body but if you drink a lot at the same moment it is of not much use actually! Imagine that your body constantly looses water and that you will have to give it back to it. Try to drink a glass of water at different times during the day. If you drink all at once you'll pee it out and 4 hours later your body is dry again!     Good luck!
SS5py9jIaa	Yeah, I hear you. The process of restoration requires real dedication. Lots of taping and binding for about two years... a guy really has to want to have his foreskin back to go through this. I do not understand why a person's spouse would interfere with something so personal .. something so obviously important for him to want to go through all that to achieve.<br>  <br>  Removing the foreskin at birth as a matter of procedure for no immediate medical reason is a rediculous approach. If a guy has a problem... wait until it develops and then decide on the best cure.... I mean, we don't rip off our fingernails to stop us from getting dirt under them do we.<br>  <br>  As for the question about where do all those removed foreskins end up.. .some of them are used in laboratories to culture human tissue... apparently there is a good market for those foreskins... the human tissue that is cultured from foreskins is used to manufacture botox. NO BULL!|`|a1YedErQaa	Women usually tend to not like it because they think it looks bad.|`|tqR1HRKzaa	hate to answer a question with a question....but where in god's name did you find your foreskin after all these years...|`|IM3QwSS2aa	because we, as humans, don't like change.  that's the original way she saw you.<br>  <br>  because, at this point in life you did okay without it, you'll be fine in the future.<br>  <br>  Mind you I'm stating reasons, but want it done myself.

g2Ypb2chaa	The only way you're going to know for sure is if you ask him and he tells you the truth.     The way I see it, the dark songs he is writing are a way of getting his feelings out without needing to cut or harm himself, so I'd say unless you find more cuts that are similar, he's probably okay.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Don't you think you should ask HIM and not a bunch of strangers?  How on earth would we be able to give you an answer?  I would be wary of marrying someone you cannot talk to about these things.|`|s5Tg2M4paa	sorry but hes probably cutting|`|6QDaqIXbaa	I think you just need to be more aware of your partners body.  While you are making love, run your fingers all over him to see if there any new abrasions. If there are, then wait until a more suitable time to ask him about it.  If he says hes not cutting himself then try to believe him as relationships are built on trust.  I hope the counseling works out for you both, and just remember that no matter what physical evidence there may be, your intuition should never be ignored.|`|vBiv67Lbaa	I've recently been diagnosed with depression and have been cutting for quite a while now. I understand that people around me sometimes feel awkward talking to me about it but i do find it much better after i have spoken to them. I honestly have no idea if he is cutting. It doesn't sound like he does to be honest; however it is a possibility but just trust him else it will make him feel worse. Counselling is definately a start to improve things and if he is cutting he should gradually open up. Deal with it sensitively, you have already asked him if he is cutting so just then say to him that you want him to tell you if he is, as you only want to help him get better. Truth is, i love art and it helps me express myself, writing is another way of expression so if he is writing his feelings down it means he is expressing things and lettings things out so he isn't totally bottling things up. I hope everything goes okay.    katierobinson07@hotmail.co.uk|`|RHFvuSa5aa	Hello :)    My boyfriend used to cut. He was diagnosed with depression too, so I kind of understand what you're going through.     I think you should be honest to each other. Usually, when they cut, it's more than one cut, and on more parts of the body. You only saw this one cut, so what he told you is probably true, if I were you I would believe him.    But if you want to make sure he's not cutting, just try talking to him about it, not in a way to point out at him the fact that he cuts, but mentioning that you would be there for him and you would help him with all you got if ever, he even felt like cutting. Show him your support, don't blame him. Show him that he can tell you anything and everything, and make him feel like everything will be ok. Just try being positive. My boyfriend has stopped cutting 3 years ago, and it's all working just fine. He's even a happier person, out of his depression.
JiATH6rGaa	My ex used to do that. (Way before we were together). I don't understand it at all. I can understand how you'd be worried. You have every right to be. But it also sounds feasible that it was just an accident at work. Is it a perfectly straight cut?     I would sit him down and talk to him. Let him know how much you care and that you won't be mad. Let him know how important trust is and if he needs help you'll be there for him.     Maybe he'll laugh it off because he really did hurt himself at work.     Good luck whatever the case may be. Hopefully it was an accident or you'll be able to work it out and he won't do it again.|`|y39iNwFjaa	I'm no expert in any way shape or form but I can't imagine that seeing one cut on someone is enough to start thinking that he's a cutter. The good thing is that you're going for counselling - and hopefully, a trained counsellor will help Patrick unload some of his worries. Maybe this extreme worry of yours is a manifestation of your own heightened anxiety/depression. Talk it through with the counsellor and trust Patrick.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	This is where trust is important. Believe him, but keep an eye on worrisome signs. I suggest you both look for healthy ways to express or channel your emotions: art, music, exercise, dance, journaling. Suggestion: It might really help if you two learn and practice active listening. Role play. You listen while he talks about his problems, concerns, and feelings. You'll know what it's time to switch. Active listening can be hard, but it's worth it. :o)    When using active listening, remember AGE  accepting (nonjudgmental)  genuine  empathy    Acknowledgment can be something as simple as a nod of the head or a simple uh huh. You arent necessarily agreeing with the person, you are simply indicating that you are listening. Using body language and other signs to acknowledge you are listening also reminds you to pay attention and not let your mind wander.    You should also try to respond to the speaker in a way that will encourage him or her to continue speaking, so that you can get the information you need. While nodding and uh huhing says youre interested, an occasional question or comment to recap what has been said communicates that you understand the message as well.     There are five key elements of active listening. They all help you ensure that you hear the other person, and that the other person knows you are hearing what they are saying.       1. Pay attention.        Give the speaker your undivided attention and acknowledge the message. Recognize that what is not said also speaks loudly.            * Look at the speaker directly.            * Put aside distracting thoughts. Dont mentally prepare a rebuttal!            * Avoid being distracted by environmental factors.            * Listen to the speakers body language.            * Refrain from side conversations when listening in a group setting.       2. Show that you are listening.        Use your own body language and gestures to convey your attention.            * Nod occasionally.            * Smile and use other facial expressions.            * Note your posture and make sure it is open and inviting.            * Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like yes, and uh huh.       3. Provide feedback.        Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener, your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect what is being said and ask questions.            * Reflect what has been said by paraphrasing. What Im hearing is and Sounds like you are saying are great ways to reflect back.            * Ask questions to clarify certain points. What do you mean when you say Is this what you mean?            * Summarize the speakers comments periodically.    Tip:  If you find yourself responding emotionally to what someone said, say so, and ask for more information: "I may not be understanding you correctly, and I find myself taking what you said personally. What I thought you just said is XXX; is that what you meant?"       4 Defer judgment.  Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits full understanding of the message.        * Allow the speaker to finish.      * Dont interrupt with counterarguments.        5 Respond Appropriately.  Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting him or her down.        * Be candid, open, and honest in your response.      * Do not give your opinion. It's about listening and allowing the other person to safely delve deeper.      * Treat the other person as you would want to be treated.|`|U9KJNuq6aa	i'd say let it slide for now and just keep an eye out from now on. you don't want to accuse him of something unless you're sure thats what he's doing. you could try talking to him about it (without accusing him) and just tell him your concerns and see how that goes.|`|ykrJB3NGaa	I used to cut when certain anxieties started up.  I know the feeling, even though I don't understand them.    Pay close attention to his reaction when you see it or ask about it.  If he seems really uncomfortable about your noticing, it may be self-injury.  If he totally doesn't seem bothered, then it's probably just a scrape he got moving stuff or whatever he does.  One cut like that is not likely to be self-injury, but if you notice more of them, be concerned.      I never found cutting to be leading to suicidal feelings, but rather a pressure-valve to let out some of those self-injury urges.  But please, don't take my advice for the ultimate word, it's just my own limited experience with it.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	First of all,   I will pray for Andy.  Secondly,  people who are cutters -- cut themselves because it is a release of pain for them.  My good friend will tell me if she has done it, but not until after the fact.      There are many websites with "support groups" for people who cut, and for family/friends/loved ones of those that do.    It's something to be concerned about, but if there is evidence of more than just one cut, he will be the one that needs to be willing to get help.    As for me, I know I can only say a prayer for Patrick, and for you, in addition to Andy's immediate needs.  May the Lord bless you with understanding, wisdom and His love.    God bless.|`|vuDdzf2kaa	no a hip is not a rare place to cut but i seriously doubt he's cutting. I was a cutter and i cut on my arms hips and thighs so a hip wouldn't be weird. I doubt he's cutting because it was only one cut and a normal cutter gets more satisfaction out of several. It's rare to see a person cut themselves one time. I also doubt he's been cutting because of his job lifting stuff and do you really think you would've thought any thing of this cut if his friend hadn't tried to kill himself? No, you probably wouldn't because people get cuts and have accidents. It would however be a concern if there were several which there were not. I personally wouldn't worry about it and I don't think you should either. But if you do see a serious of cuts, that could be a problem but i highly doubt that he is really cutting himself. I hope your friend gets better and I hope you guys work everything out! =]|`|637a5c03a75067bb2597c847507db47eaa	Wow. I am not sure why you would automatically jump to this conclusion. It seems dramatic at best. I think it is more likely that his job caused it and that you should CHILLAX.|`|Z1GS3gMKaa	Well since you are going to counseling together.

Sometimes the door frame fails in normal useage not by reason that it is weak, but by reason that the fixings of the frame to the structure are weak. That's why these home gym solutions can carry a risk... there are too many variables.
Pmb0MeB8aa	Sodium is part of a lot of different labs. There is a specific test for sodium. It is also part of the Basic Metabolic Profile (also called Chem 7), Comprehensive Metabolic Profile, and Renal Profile. Those are all more expensive than just a sodium level, though.    As for sites...your doctor's office didn't draw it and send it off? A clinic should be able to do that. If your doctor's office can't do that, call/email your doctor for a recommendation on where he'd like you to go for the tests. Doctors tend to have preferred places for such so they can get the results faster.|`|aSvOaAjiaa	Sodium is tested as part of the biochemistry set U & E (UK) why does her Dr not arrange it?|`|lGzUHWn3aa	A simple blood test will suffice. You may have to ASK that the sodium levels be run. High Na levels can lead to high blood pressure and will usually lead to low Potassium. This in turn will give you foot/leg cramps. It's not something to mess with. Get the test run.|`|PR6w9XzAaa	Sodium is an electrolyte, so it will be under the basic metabolic panel.|`|0rpN2419aa	Yes, tell her to ask for an electrolytes checked.  I have Addison's disease and have to have my electrolytes checked at my yearly physical.  (for me it is sodium/potassium) but generally if you ask, your Dr. can order a complete blood screening for your mom to check cholesterol, glucose, etc. Your Dr. should call the lab and set up the blood testing for her, mine does it in his clinic.
Z8DGKDHBaa	No, your body will just pee out whatever you don;t use. No harm with taking a lot of Vitamin C.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	it is too possible to take too much of anything really. there have been people who have died just from drinking too much water!|`|sQu3LLqtaa	The Vitamin C Foundation actually recommends 3 gm (3,000 mg) per day but most Health Authorities recommend a lot less.|`|lXJbuz2Yaa	Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is non-toxic, but taking too much can have short and long term effects. It is virtually impossible to overdose on Vitamin C from natural sources.     Most of the effects of over-dosing with Vitamin C are long term, but short term symptoms of over-dosing include stomach aches, stomach cramps, nausea and diarrhoea. Urinary tract infections are also common, and there is an increased tendency for blood to clot. Extremely large doses can cause back pain. The effects of high doses vary widely from person to person.     If megadoses (very high doses) of Vitamin C are taken for long periods the body becomes dependent on the high doses, and when withdrawn scurvy can be the result. This is most often seen in babies where the mother takes megadoses during pregnancy. When the baby is born, it may get 'rebound' scurvy, with the following symptoms: loss of appetite, irritability, failure to gain weight, or weight loss. bleeding gums, dry and rough skin, degenerating muscles, loose teeth, and wounds that will not heal.    Other symptoms of long-term Vitamin C overdose are the formation of kidney and bladder stones. Jaundice can also be the result of habitual over-use. In people with dark skin a common genetic disorder is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and in these people overdosing on Vitamin C can cause the red blood cells to break down, and there may be Vitamin B12 deficiency as a result.     Megadoses of Vitamin C can also result in copper deficiency due to the interaction between the two. Vitamin C also reduces the intake of zinc and manganese, and can interfere with insulin response, creating insulin 'spikes'.     The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C is no more than 75-90mg in adults (slightly higher in smokers). Anything over 3-500mg is simply excreted by the body in urine, since the body does not store Vitamin C. If your urine is bright yellow after taking Vitamin C supplements, you might as well simply toss the pills into the toilet bowl and cut out the middle man!

AA11304279	To start off I would say before you go to bed try to write down at least 2 things positive that happened to you in the day. then go around to your family that is in the house with you and tel them one thing positive. then when you go to bed your going to bed on a postive note. then when you wake up think of 2 positive things that you want to accomplish for the day. when you are able to actually accomplish those 2 make it 3 and so on. then your nightly rountine may contain them as the positive thing you want to write down. all this goes into a journal for you to look back on. Even if you feel positive about lets say for example that you didnt' obsess about smell today that is a start and very positive step for you. As for your friends that you are around if they are over at your house part with them when they leave with a postive thing said to. Your family and friends can even help you by writing positive things that they see you doing during the day and read them to you at the end of day.   For your anxiety acknowledge what it is that is causing it at the time and write it down. then write down ways to overcome what caused it. and speak about it to the people that are around you at the time that it happens or the people that are involved in it.   hope this helps and if you ever need anyone to talk to just write me an email fwnaw@yahoo.com|`|VTee51r9aa	I have a slight case of OCD myself but mine is more associated with things being in their correct spots, folded correctly and with germs I need to wash my hands constantly. I found some information on the internet that helped me deal with this along with my fiance being very supportive and understanding. But if you think you have a severe case than maybe you could see your school counselor or a psychologist. Here are some websites that  might be helpful to you:  http://www.anxietyandstress.com/dealingw...  http://www.incrisis.org/Library/OCD.htm  http://kidshealth.org/college/your_mind/...|`|e71MWgJJaa	try to feel confident about yourself and try to get happier look at the positive not the negatives  just dont think about yourself as someone bad.|`|1A7KCw7faa	dont worry you are not letting anyone down its not your fault that you have ocd. there is absoloutly nothing wrong with you look at this website it talks about the same things you are going through.  http://www.ocfoundation.org/ocd-in-child...    here is an artical from a website hope it helps      Helping Kids With OCD  It's important to understand that OCD is never a child's fault. Once a child is in treatment, it's important for parents to participate, to learn more about OCD, and to modify expectations and be supportive.    Kids with OCD get better at different rates, so try to avoid any day-to-day comparisons and recognize and praise any small improvements. Keep in mind that it's the OCD that is causing the problem, not the child. The more that personal criticism can be avoided, the better.    It can be helpful to keep family routines as normal as possible, and for all family members to learn strategies to help the child with OCD. It is also important to not let OCD be the "boss" of the house and regular family activities. Giving in to OCD worries does not make them go away.    talk to your mom about treatment if you havnt already it will help you overcome the tough things you are dealing with.(by the way im 14 too)|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	I have lived with insane panic attacks and anxiety for years, up until recently.    See, I always realized that when i ate well and exercised my episodes were less often and less intense. But then my mom found out about magnesium difeciencies and MSG.    MSG is an exciterant (not really a word.. lol) but its a major upper. It causes mental issues because it builds up in our systems over the years and it never has a chance to metabolize. It causes anxiety, compulsive behavior, pains, fears, heat palpitaions.. just a slew of major issues. IT IS IN EVERYTHING WE EAT! I am not kidding you. Google it. If anything you eat says "spices" "natural flavors" "whey protein" "malted barley" (or malted anything) or flow agents, or carmel color (JUST TO NAME A VERY FEW) it contains the toxic ingredient the creates MSG. Its in our bread, its in our dairy products, its in our crackers and our cereals, its even injected into most meats taht we buy from the store. They even use MSG in low fat and salt free dairy and food items to make up for the lacking flavor. Its even in baby formula for God's sake.    When I cut out MSG (i buy direct from the butcher, the animal was alive that morning, and in my freezer that afternoon, i eat only foods without any of the questoinable ingredients, and whole fat foods) after about just a week or two i felt amazing. I tested it to see if it was just in my head, i went and ate regular food, normal cereal, normal meat, normal dairy, and deli foods and just normal stuff. After just a week I was right back at having nightly episodes.    I know it sounds silly, but it might give you the leg up you need. its unreal the amount of chemicals in what we eat.    Google "avoiding MSG" you'll find all sorts of info.    Also, because of the diets we eat as americans we are just about all of us short on magnisium. Being short can cause anxiety issues, among other things. Pick up some slow-mag, just half a dose will help out.|`|PbESq4Cyaa	you can change if you really tried hard|`|WtiZqXh5aa	My closest friend has OCD. What she does is when she gets anxiety, she gets nervous, and cleans her room up and down. Whenever I see her get this way, we go for long walks in the park to clear her head for a while, and after about a half of an hour to an hour she feels so much better, so i would say if you have a close friend, or a pet you can have walk with you to do so. Good luck!!!!!|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	Don't worry about letting anyone down because you can't take care of anyone else til you take care of yourself.  Be as kind and patient with yourself as you would be with someone else who had these issues.  Keep in mind that you have these perceptions to deal with and try to be objective.  Get into therapy!|`|cvnVNpreaa	Well, in my opinion you should try thinking positive in any situation. Never let yourself think negative and don't hang around people that ignore you or are sad/depressed because mood is contagious   when when you are i the worst mood possible, try and smile, think happy thoughts and about the mornings, try thinking about something you would love in your life, something really nice in the evenings before going to sleep so when you wake up you will think back and feel more positive.  Hope it helps x|`|OCBn0A9uaa	i think there's medication you can take for OCD and anxiety. probably the same one treats both.  that might help some, but you'd need to also try to fix your problems for yourself at the same time; the meds can't do that on their own.    as for the Asperger's syndrome, i don't think there is anything you can take for that, you just need to work on your social skills and things will get better.    good luck :)|`|7F8jjzhaaa	sometimes the best help can be a friend you trust who you can confide in. being self concious is just part of being a teenager. my mother would always tell me I smelt bad, so I was always really self concious about that. I just remember to wear deoderant and a little perfume if I feel really self concious. I just try to stay away from people who make me feel bad about myself. I have Anxiety too, and I find that meditating every now and then and just letting myself get really worked up and just learning to let go and think about things helps, or just having a journal, to get all my nreves down on paper. I know it's hard, and some issues never go away, but you can learn to go through your life more relaxed. be confident, believe in yourself. trust in people, but people you know that are trustworthy. blocking everyone out and going through tough stuff like this alone is the worst thing to do.|`|TdppsvJ7aa	i did not read what u wrote but any way good luck!:)|`|RIZpDdNgaa	awe, I know how you feel because i have OCD and anxiety ( which is much better now).  You must be very intelligent.  Anyways, you need to seek professional help because anxiety is like a battle and it needs to be fought, with some therapy and medication it will be gone but it will still be a there a bit.  You have an amazing future ahead of you and this is just a little bump in the road, you will look back on this and say wow this was nothing, my therapist told me that and she was right because it is nothing in the scheme of life, keep holding on and get some therapy.  STAY STRONG xX
xnZi0i8saa	Try a hot bath and warm milk before bed. The calcium in the milk helps relax you but don't do hot chocolate because there is caffeine in the chocolate. You have to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on the weekends. Even if you can't fall asleep you cannot sleep late the next day. No caffeine after noon. There are other relaxation tips to try but ultimately the best thing is to have a "habit" of falling asleep at the same time every night. This may take sleeping pills to achieve....|`|6NZeItMAaa	If you take your stress with you when going to bed you'll find it difficult to get sleep.    First of all, try to identify your stressors, exercise, eat healthy and go to bed every day at the same hour. Get up early even if you didn't sleep enough because that way you'll feel sleepy when night comes.    Nobody wants to take the time to exercise or actually come to terms with different stressors. Nobody wants to hear that they have to eat right. We dont even give them a chance. We want a cure for what ails us and dont want to be inconvenienced with it any more than necessary.    This is not to say that anyone who is suffering from stress and depression should not seek medical attention or take medication when necessary. In some cases, it is necessary to take prescription pills. However, a prescription should be used as a last resort, not the first thing that we try whenever we feel stressed.    Throughout our lives, we are bound to encounter stress. We have to learn how to deal with it effectively or we will be doomed to taking medication just to get through everyday life.     If you are suffering from stress, try a natural herbal remedy, before you embark on a series of SSRI medications or tranquilizers.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	drink nyquil!!!|`|4YSSOO7Taa	Lavender candles, or something that gives of the smell of lavender (I.E Lavender XD).

ufgv7oTjaa	It should have instructions on the container... some are pills, some are creams. Both of them will obviously have different recommendations (how many pills to take, how much and where to rub the cream, etc), so it's best to follow the recommendations on the container.    However, nothing can force your body to grow taller than your DNA says you will. There are some things that can take away from your potential height (including smoking, drugs, caffeine, etc), so as long as you stay away from those and have a healthy diet, you should grow as tall as you're supposed to. Besides all that, your growing age normally peaks around 20 years old, so if you're younger than that, you've got plenty of time to finish growing and any HGH pills (or other "artificial growth" products) can actually be detrimental to your height and/or health. If you are over 20 years old, HGH won't help with height anyway because your bones would have already fused.  However, if they are insoles, those will help to boost your height because they are adding the height, not making you grow taller.
chOS6EO0aa	I am sorry to hear that you are stressed out. You should try some time management and spread out your assignments so you can do them slowly instead of all at once. Also drink some chamomile tea before bed and try to establish a bedtime routine. Make sure if it is other issues you try to journal and figure them out. Try also to set a minimum time that you have to sleep for eg. my time is 7 hours.|`|eQZ8u5POaa	celestial seasonings "sleepy time" tea!|`|e3eed8e1848cf66173578a71330925b5aa	well,my friend sleeping problem mostly are psychological,may the pressure of  studying or another personal problem,drugs like valium have side effects and u cant take it for a long time bc of dependence,so i urge to look for ur problem and solve it|`|G8JqSneHaa	try some yoga. yoga helps everything.

Why would this only bother you in the mornings? Perhaps the amount of Bile has built up over night. You may wish to go to PCP and tell Him/ Her what is happening. They will send you for a Wet Cat Scan to take a good luck at the Gall Bladder to rule out any stones or obstructions.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	There are 20 things that this could be, it could be gas, gastritis, gallstones, diverticulitis, celiac disease, colon cancer, colon polyps, chrons disease, aortic anuerism (abdomen), constipation, food poisoning, gastroenteritis, irritible bowel syndrome, muscle strain, panic attack, peptic ulcer, intestinal ischemia, lactose intolerant, anemia, and last but not least ascaris worms.<br>  <br>  I would say you might want to talk to a doctor.
gzBDlCLzaa	Talk to your doctor soon. When getting off Paxil you have to do it slowly and reduce your dose over about a week before quitting.<br>  <br>  The symptoms are from the immediate stop of the medication.<br>  <br>  Take half your regular dose for about a week, then take a quarter for three days, then stop all together. This will eliminate most of the withdrawal symptoms.|`|hRc7Awfbaa	Go see a doctor or at least call the pharmicist you got the meds from.<br>  They should know the drugs the best.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	Yes, these could be withdrawal symptoms, but it would be good to check with your doctor to make sure.<br>  <br>  Paxil takes about six weeks to completely leave your system. You can expect the withdrawal symptoms to hang around for a while, then gradually subside. <br>  <br>  It's usually better to withdraw from an SSRI gradually over a period of time than to quit suddenly. Now you know why! I hope you feel better soon.
H5NGXgqsaa	I suggest that if you have not yet tried to do a search for the specific area of addiction...to do so. Otherwise, I can suggest to you a few avenues that may help you~ Visit www.webmd.com a very user friendly site that not only enhances ones education on health & various medical conditions/treatments/assistance etc...terrific site! Also if you look into www.ivillage.com you may find numerous support groups offered in the area you are interested. Look into Yahoo groups online as well, Yahoo has many excellent chat groups/interest groups you may be pleasantly surprised!

During   menstruation, this discharge keeps the vagina clean. Healthy vaginal discharge thickens and   increases when you are sexually stimulated, when you are breastfeeding, or when you ovulate.    The female body has a natural method of cleansing itself and does not need the aid of   douches or scented sprays. The use of scented sprays can irritate the vaginal area and cause   a disturbance in the vaginas pH balance. Cleaning the vagina with unscented soap on a daily   basis is a good hygiene practice. Avoid using scented soaps, bubble baths or sprays and   make sure to pat the vaginal area dry with a clean towel. Scented tampons, sanitary napkins   and toilet tissue are not good to use either. Bacteria grows in wet, warm, and closed areas so   avoid wearing wet clothes or wet bathing suit for an extended period of time.

3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	The best answer i have read so far is from mentel junkie. usually if i see an answer that i think sufficiently address the the question, i do not answer it myself.   But as someone with DID, i believe i can offer the most definitive answer.  In a person with DID, they may and most often do experience many symptoms associated with a wide variety of other disorders. that leads me to the first part of my answer, and as i can personally attest, a very important part.  Schizophrenia is a pretty straight forward diagnosis to receive. it's symptom, or the combination of them are not commonly associated with other disorders. That being the case, they are diagnosed much more quickly with the correct diagnosis. As such, they are able to receive treatment that targets their specific problem.   DID on the other hand is very difficult to diagnose, furthermore it is not even fully accepted by the psychiatric community, making diagnosis even more difficult.   Because a person with DID posseses a multitue of "alters", often times the doctor will recieve different information from the patient on different visits.   I will use myself, hopefully as a useful example.   I was initially diagnosed with depression after a nervous breakdown in 1995.   In 2002, after a suicide attempt, i was diagnosed with deep recurrent depression with psychotic features,and PTSD, along with GAD.  In 2004-5 my diagnosis was changed to Bi-Polar 1 with psychotic features  In 2006, Panic attacks were added  In 2007, after having been on heavy doses of anti-psychotics for years, i happend across an artical on webMD about DID. After reading it, it was clear to me that this was the actual problem i suffered from.  In 2007, after presenting the information to my doctor i was finally correctly diagnosed.      Number 2. Schizophrenics are unaware that the voices they hear, and the hallucinations they have are not real. Further, they tend to shun help. they will have delusions, paranoia as well as other things which are in their unreal worlds. They are unaware they have a problem.    People with DID most often realize they have a problem, have been seeking help for years to figure out what it is. Persons with DID often struggle with great amounts of emotion pain, often leading to suicide. The voices we here, we know are NOT real, but rather are the converations taking place within the confines of our own minds. In the mass majority of cases, persons with DID never have hallucinations.  We are coherent to what is "really" going on in the world around us, though most of us do suffer from pychosis.     If you need any more details please email me, and dont forget my ten points :) I am on Y/A's while back in the states waiting for a bed to open up at Sheppard Pratts trauma ward. I live in the Philipippines cuz life is more sinmple for me there and people there dont notice my "quirkyness"|`|3zontan0aa	Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and Schizophrenia have some common symptoms but DID is a personality disorder most thought to be brought on as a result of trauma. Someone with multiple or split   personalities are usually diagnosed with DID. A child that has been abused, sexually or physically, will sometimes "split off" a stronger personality in order to protect the inner child that has been abused. Cases have shown that a child, when the personality splits, will present physical signs, such as the voice will change,  the blood pressure will increase and the pupils will dilate. Schizophrenia, in lay terms, is when someone has hallucinations or is very paranoid. They think that everyone is out to get them. They often imagine that someone is watching them or bugging their phone or following them but it is very real to them.|`|WQmSuz86aa	People with untreated schizophrenia have delusions, hallucinations and incoherent speech. It is usually treatable with medication, and it's thought that there is a genetic component to the disorder.    Dissociative Identity Disorder is a condition that is usually caused by severe, prolonged trauma/abuse at a young age. It is more closely related to Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome than schizophrenia. DID was formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, but was renamed about 15 years ago. The diagnosis is still considered controversial, but recent studies have suggested that as many as 1% of the population may have DID. That means 1 out of every 100 people could be walking around with it. Considering other statistics that show at least 1 out of every 4 children is abused, this shouldn't seem unbelievable.    What makes DID hard to diagnose and hard for people to believe is the fact that people with DID are usually able to function quite effectively in society and hide their disorder. Survival is a skill they had to learn at a young age.    Medication can usually alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia so the person can function well, but there is no single medicine or group of medicines that can alleviate all the symptoms of DID because it is a result of abuse, not an organic issue within the body. Treatment for DID usually consists of long-term psychological therapy to deal with the abuse that triggered the condition.    Showtime has a new TV series called "The United States of Tara" featuring a woman with multiple personalities. If the first two episodes are an example of what's coming, it will be an excellent series.|`|ifwgd5dMaa	Schizophrenics usually hear voices that aren't there, but they are always themselves.  Paranoia is also common.    Dissociative Identity Disorder, also known as Multiple Personality Disorder is when there are two personalities "inhabiting" the same person.  When one personality is dominant, the other is not present, and usually neither knows that the other one exists.  The non-dominant personalities frequently have different interests or skills than the "main" personality.  Psychiatrists generally try to eliminate extra personalities, because they can cause difficulties including blackout periods for the dominant personality.|`|5ad5598dc77782773e361b3821253d4eaa	Above all schizophrenia is not multiple personalities! Schizophrenia is commonly and erroneously thought to be a split personality. DID or multiple personalities is a rare (some psychologists/psychiatrists do not even believe it exists) personality disorder which is not usually found in Schizophrenics. Look up "Dissociative Identity Disorder" and "schizophrenia" in a Yahoo! web search for more detailed info. Wikipedia has good summaries.|`|q1rPAlBLaa	im not absolutely positive as im only 16, but i do read lots of jodi piccoult books and she seems to have a thing for using dissociative-ness a lot.     when u r dissociative or in a dissociative state, u basically do not know whats going on... victims of abuse often go into dissociative states... basically they tune everything out and their mind goes blank and they cant remember anything that happened to them while in the dissociative state....    so im guessing that someone with a DID is often in that state     which wud mean they ghave a "dissociative" personality and there coherent personality....     but they wud not remember anything that occured while they were in the state after leaving it  and they wont remember anything the next time they enter one....  however with schizophrenia the person has multiple personalities and  doesnt remember anything that happens while they are occupying a different persona, however they are always coherent and once they switch personas again they remember    im not quite sure....as i said im only 16...    good luck|`|LC3Gf5uBaa	schizophrenia is a multifaceted term generally preceded with a qualifying adverb,....paranoid.....catatonic.......... dis associative........ the "disorder" word is the  distinguish er.

He was a dis associative schizophrenic- with delusions ,  grandeur,  visual and auditory hallucinations.|`|xC6W8a5taa	Schizophrenia can consist of thought disorder with disorganized speech, emotional blunting, delusions (e.g thinking that thoughts are being pumped into ones head), and auditory or visual hallucinations.  Dissociative identity disorder or 'multiple personality disorder' is where a person displays multiple personalities and has a sort of amnesia with no recollection of the other personalities when he or she switches. Its basically like having multiple bodies in one and is a rare condition to have - something like 100+ cases I think.

Signs that a mole needs investigated are change in size or color over a short period of time, bleeding, constant irritation of the top of the mole by clothing.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|t6ie999Vaa	this is what i do:<br>  <br>  cut the fats!<br>  for example, i eat rice everyday...so i had to cut it. i substitute it with vegetables and eat lean meat, etc.<br>  don't eat ice cream, chocolates, butter, oily foods...etc.<br>  and drink water don't drink like caprisun. lol cuz i love that!<br>  <br>  learn how to read the nutrition facts. <br>  all i read is the calories thing...for ex. this bread i ate said its calories is 80, but its fat calories is 10...which is a good thing..just lose that 10 calories..<br>  <br>  and keep a journal or a diary of what you've eaten throughout the day.<br>  check out your daily calorie for your age...and it to have a good diet, just cut out 500 calories from that daily calorie you get. and you will lose a pound a week...that would be the minimum.<br>  <br>  and don't forget to exercise.<br>  start with warmups...like pushups, it may be hard at first but keep doing it and you'll realize your arms are getting stronger. sit ups, etc. <br>  oh, and don't eat after 7 pm!!! and don't always think about food & stay away from the kitchen, only when you are gonna eat big meals. uhmm, yeah don't go to restaurants, fast foods. if you want to be in a strict diet.<br>  =)|`|YeWrtZIraa	Eat eggs for breakfast...seriously.<br>  <br>  (<a href="http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/weight_loss/weight_loss_tips/eat_eggs.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/wei...</a><br>  <br>  Definitely eat a good breakfast. <br>  <br>  Eat a moderately sized lunch and only one plate of food at dinner. <br>  <br>  Eat some healthy snacks during the day when you get hungry (yogurt, bananas, apples, raw vegetables, anything natural and healthy). <br>  <br>  Exercise- even if you're tired after school or work, take your dog on a walk, or go walk with a friend, or join the YMCA (or any gym). <br>  <br>  Don't obsess over losing weight...this will only make you gain weight! <br>  <br>  Don't use scales or pay attention to your suggested BMI.

Dhz4XgQ3aa	hey honey,    why dont you call the museum on friday and see if anything has been handed in.    I am going to be honest, your mum may be angry but all you can do is apologise. People lose things all the time and its not as though you have done it on purpose. She may be very understanding you never know. Only you know your mum and how she is likely to react.  And if she is angry she wont stay angry at you. It will help when she sees how upset you are at losing them.    Wait until you have called the museum on friday to see if they were handed in. Then you have the weekend to tell her.     Dont worry yourself sick about it.   If your mum is upset she will be upset or angry at the fact they are lost not for you losing them as it may seem.    You can not do anything about it now, its done. There is no point worrying about it. I know its upsetting and i know how horrible it is and you start wishing you hadnt taken them with you etc.     I lost a ring my nan gave me many years ago and i was so upset.   But you have to let it go, You will get other beautiful gifts in the future and some will mean just as much to you as the broaches did.

GI27dKIkaa	Either pair would protect your eyes - however - polarised lenses will cut down the glare from the sun and snow !<br>  <br>  Polarised lenses work by only allowing light through from certain directions - they're designed to filter out light from high angles (from the sun) and low angles (snow etc)|`|aJp3BbWcaa	Hey I like these sunglasses they are nice <a href="http://ecom1.sno-ski.net/sunglasses.html" rel="nofollow">http://ecom1.sno-ski.net/sunglasses.html</a> the blue one caught my attention it's design is very adorable.|`|Vk7kkrcLaa	When you say normal sunglasses - do they have a UV400 block? that is the main thing that you should be looking for. this means that they will protect the health of your eyes from the reflected UV light from the snow.

IgNADy1Taa	Hmm she might be a little offended if someone left an article on her desk anonymously and it might even be perceived as condescending if you bombard her with all that info. And if she is as b*tchy as you say she might even make a fuss asking who put it on her desk and that would be embarrassing for the both of you.<br>  <br>  Perhaps she already knows it spreads germs but is indifferent to it, just like everyone has been told we should wash our hands after going to the toilet but the last survey I read, the vast majority of guys don't bother. Lots of people also rarely wash their hands with soap. I've also seen lots of people sneeze without bothering to cover. Since there will always be so many germs floating about that we'll never be able to avoid, she might just think she's not putting anyone at that much more risk.<br>  <br>  To let her know that it is at least bothering you, all I could suggest is something really subtle...next time you're around her, cough and make a point of covering your mouth. People often tend to imitate what others do, even if they don't realise consciously (of course she might also see you and realise normal people cover their mouths whereas she might not have realised before...since I assume it's pretty unusual for the rest of you colleagues to walk around coughing so much for her to see!)<br>  Or even cough around her - and don't cover - and then make a point of apologising for not putting your hand in front of your mouth. It might wake her up. Or, if she is not phased by it, you might find out what her real reasoning is (i.e. she might say something like "Oh don't worry it's not like you have any germs" in which case you could retaliate with some friendly info..)<br>  <br>  Btw does she really walk around coughing all that much?

I get dry skin a lott and the best thing to do is to wash ur scalp really well w/ shampoo and conditioner in the shower.<br>  <br>  Usually lice r found in the back of ur head so u might wanna check there.|`|AW96nSpUaa	chill hun, its dandruff<br>  <br>  <br>  :D peace|`|XK0kZ8Iiaa	And your head would be itching severely!!  Be sure to rinse well as leaving the shampoo in your hair will leave that white stuff in it. Youre OK on the lice.  Dont use anyone elses combs, brushes, hats, etc to hopefully stay free of it.|`|F4OKs8efaa	Yes you are getting paranoid!! Relax, you do not have headlice, because they look like insects and they are pretty big like a flea if you ever seen one on your dog or something.|`|4TqUgtpzaa	You are just over-reacting. Lice are not exactly white, they have more of a darker color to them. You are fine.
IM3QwSS2aa	yep, that's normal.  that's limited space in there so yeah it looks like it's gonna burst.  that's why when you ejaculate your remove the penis and remove the condom off the penis a seperate place away from the vagina.<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Be glad it looks that way. If it didn't and dripping the you would have a bigger problem.|`|63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	Yup.  Jerome is right.  It will not burst.  They can take a lot of abuse and stretching without leaking or breaking (assuming you are not using some cheap *** thing from a mens room dispenser.)|`|TYFSWhh3aa	no, the condoms to loose you need to leave some room at the top of the condom.|`|AA11871081	Leave more room in the tip.|`|EhJlgKLAaa	after you ejaculate into it grab the end of it and pull it. it most likely will not pop it just looks like it would|`|a1YedErQaa	Yeah the tip is there to hold your junk so to speak heh...

I have had difficulty sleeping for as long as I remember. I've tried all sorts of things. I find that the meds that doctors prescribe give me a hangover the day after. Recently, I started on Sleep Once Again, which I think is great. It's natural and doesn't give me that hangover. Have a look at the site where I got mine from, if you like.    The other things I find useful are:-  1. don't drink coffee/tea/soda with caffeine for at least 3 hours before you sleep  2. try relaxation techniques in the evening  3. don't watch scary/suspense/similar movies just before you turn in for the night  4. try reading a boring book for several minutes before you lie down    Good luck!|`|6c9CyuX9aa	Trazadone is pretty strong and very addictive.

icgTII3Maa	It depends on the type of drug used, dose & schedule of treatment. Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs that destroy cells that grow rapidly, a characteristic of cancer cells. Unfortunately, chemotherapy also affects normal cells that grow rapidly, like cells that generate sperm in the testes.    Some chemotherapy drugs are more likely to cause sterility, while there tends to be a much lesser degree of long-term toxicity with the newer forms of chemotherapy. The classes of chemotherapy drugs that are more likely to cause sterility are alkylating agents, platinum compounds (Platinol?), melphalan, to mention a few.|`|KOH5kPuLaa	the dr wanted me to save sperm before i was treated because it can cause sterility but now i have a wonderful 3yo to prove that it doesn't always mean that you will be sterile
Yx5iSat4aa	Yes.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Well--you MIGHT if you knowingly have the virus and deliberately spread it to someone else.    My opinion.........|`|2y3rFvZIaa	It depends on the laws of your state. In some state if someone who is HIV+ has unprotected sex and does not tell the partner, it is considered attempted murder. Check your state.|`|2ydP2Wyzaa	This is a very interesting question, star for u!!  Well, it's also a good ethical an legal debate.  In one side, any HIV patient has the right to NOT to tell about his/her disese, this applies also for any other medical condition, it's the patient's right to confidenciality, on the other side, you have the other person's right to health, so the conflict starts.  People have been sent to jail for knowinly exposing someone to HIV and NOT telling the sexual partner about it, but this has been very debated, some patients argue that if they are under treatment, viral load undetectable, and use protection, the transmission risk is extremely low, so they don't think they have the obligation to tell, of course, affected people don't see it that way.   Of course, if the patient doesn't know about the HIV or any other STD, he can't be sued.  Personaly, I do believe is a form of killing, and that people should know about any STD affecting a potential partner. People's freedom ends where other people's rights begin. Then again, this is just my own personal opinion.|`|za3jhEJTaa	no u can not go to jail for spreadind aids
LGkb4xibaa	you have very low self esteem. You need to try and feel better about yourself. If your feeling lonely its probably because your holding too much in and isolating yourself somewhat, without meaning to.  Try talking to people about how you feel. If your mum or dad arent listening, then talk to someone else you feel comfortable with.    Figure out what makes you sad/angry. If its from yourself, eg- your frustrated with yourself or feel like your no good, try and do things that make you feel better. Maybe join clubs or working more at what your good at.     Your mums wrong im afraid. If you feel really bad you should see a doctor. If you really cant cope then its the best way forward. So if you do feel that bad, be polite but insistant with her, and im sure she'll book you in.    Also, if you are genuinely obese, take up a exercising. I was 3 stone overweight. I lost it by exercising. Competitive sports are good too as they help you build relationships and team skills.  I also changed my diet. If you eat when your depressed, try and snack on healthy food or fruit.    As for your friend. Hes prob embarrassed. Try to make him understand your sorry its made him feel awkward and you'd like to forget that happened and move on. If he carries on acting stupid, then forget about him. Find other friends that will treat you right.       Pain in your chest sounds like stress or tension. Well done on stopping the self harm. Stay strong on that. It achieves nothing. Problems are still there, you just have to hide scars then as well. And your mums wrong. Even if it was attention seeking(and i dont think yours is) theres obv a problem there and it shouldnt just be written off.|`|PvPPivLJaa	Talk to your school counselor. Perhaps she can get your mom to see you have a problem that needs more than St. Johns Wort.  Do you go to church? Maybe talk to someone there if you do. Or, perhaps look for sites online for people with depression. They have a lot of information, exercises, forums and chats that may help you deal with it until you make it into the doctor.      There are also hotlines in your area for depression etc. Search online and find one.    If you want to get better, you have to be proactive and aggressive with it.     Good luck.    Maybe keep a diary or journal for now to get some of those feelings out.|`|2yvq11Hiaa	i would suggest that you go to the docs, at the end of the day you dont have to take the meds they give you but ifyou go then can  talk to you and maybe help in other ways    you need to speak to somebody about this and preferably somebody that has been through it themselves before|`|NWwKrrC3aa	Best option, is to talk to your GP (you don't have to go with your parents, because it can be embarressing or upsetting) and tell them everything you have been thinking, feeling, going through. Your GP should be a good option as you won't get the feeling of judging you in anyway, and they will know what to do as they see this kind of thing often.    Don't be shy, just think, if you get over the difficult part of telling someone, which will be very short. You will be able to get better and feel happy within yourself, for a long time.    Good luck :)    P.s i've tried st johns wort, and it didn't work for me either. I later tried counselling and anti depressants, and i am now off them, and living my life normally. Its a long process, but has a great outcome.|`|JY8J9nc5aa	When i was 13 i started something like this... it was like my life was on a downward spiral and everyday was worse than the one before.     I found that what helped me was really just a change.  I grew up a bit over the summer holidays when i came back i had a new image, i spent time on my make up and hair and really tried to make and effort (this isn't just vanity it does actually take your mind of things)   I started hanging out with new people and made a real effort in school with home work and stuff ( which again took my mind of things)     when it was happening i coundt tell any one i denied self harming (which still very occasionally comes back if things get really bad)  but i felt like i had to deal with it myself.   so one other thing i really do suggest is if your school had a councillor go and see them. honestly it really does help and your parents don't even have to know.     About the boy thing... i still haven't worked that out yet...     but you just have to carry on .. act like you dont care, tell people that you have given up on him... when he hears he will be shocked. people always want what they cant have.    hope this helps   hang in there xxx

My nurse practioner told me that my heel problems and foot pains were because of my weight. If you carry your weight in your tummy & lower tummy when you sit down it cuts off circulation to your lower half of your body. When I joined a cheap gym that had water areobics I lost 45 lbs and 90% of my problems stopped. It may seem impossible to find time. Ask friends and ask family to watch your babes so you can spend some time just walking laps in the pool. That is how I did it. Sadly we had to stop going, and I gained it all back and I am having what you are having now.     We are going to go back. I don't have kids but I have commitments at home, and things never seem to stop for me to breathe.    If you family knows how serious you are, they will support you.    My tip is this, find a large retirement community that has a gym and a pool and ask the workers at the desk if they allow people outside of the community to join. the reason why is we paid 50 dolars for an unlimted pass for myself and my husband.....    The water areobics will get your body back in shape slowly and make things that are weak stronger then you can graduate into land areobics at the center. Because it's at a retirement center the workouts will be acceptable for you as a beginner. Once you get stronger you can take harder classes in a different gym.    Reading your question, no doctor mentioned water areboics as therapy or trying to help you loose weight to take pressure off of your lower body. It is amazing what a few pounds off can do and trust me girl I know first hand because we are in the same boat except I don't have little ones.     I did not hurt once during or after water classes or pool walking. By the way walking pools are no higer than 4 feet in the middle.     Take care best wishes.|`|UmpJ0UCfaa	lol no dont chop it of. umm i think u should apply to that show where they cure stuff...|`|79ZdM70Taa	You need a MAN, baby.|`|ijeninncaa	Erm..Sounds like a problem with circulation maybe?

It is L4-L5 and you have not de-generated enough for them to want to operate. Meditate, stretch and stay away from the pain killers for as long as you can.  Do not use OTC pain meds daily or your liver will get you back for it later.   Be a wimp. do not lift anything over 5 pounds ever. Rest it for Months and it might repair.  (I had 4 children when I was going through it .. so I know what your thinking. Let then know you cant pick them up and why without scaring them they will climb on you if they have to! lol)   Give it 6 months of effort to repair, eat well, stay rested and meditate. then get another MRI. All that radiation is no better for you if every doctor wants to test something new.     A good surgeon will pick it up on the MRI you already have.

I know this one man in Kentucky, he actually knows what he is doing. if you could get a proper message/stretch, it would go back in place, and relieve all your pain. the tingle is from a nerve being pinched. and if you put your disk back in place, all the pain would go away. you have an option but its quite costly. my grandmother has this message table. its called NugaBest. look it up on youtube.com this bed, stretches your back out naturally and heats up all the nerves, relieving pain. and puting the disk back in place. its about $3,000 but if you have no other hope, you can give this a try. my husband also has back problems, and we are going to buy this bed.

I can understand how you feel and believe no doctor must give up before finding a solution or showing a way or place to go for the patient. Have they checked for Hansens? There is no need to club all your symptoms into one disease. As per the history you give it is possible your backache and leg pain could be OA spine whereas the foot problem could be a local skin problem.

CHiEKZrLaa	Auto-immune (AI) conditions are notoriously very difficult to treat.    There are some herbal/naturopathic treatments that can be quite beneficial... but when it comes to AI issues, anyone who prescribes without knowing your full medical history SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED.    Seek medical advice from someone trained and qualified who can review your history, is aware of any tests you've had recently and can determine specifically what biological process needs to be addressed for your case...  THEN pick the right herbal/natural treatments for you.    In Canada, check www.cand.ca to find a registered ND in your area.
uFRIsdC7aa	What Is Walking Pneumonia?   For days your teenager has complained of a sore throat. At night you hear a dry hacking cough that doesn't stop coming from your child's bedroom. Is this a bad cold or pneumonia?   It could be atypical pneumonia, commonly called "walking pneumonia."  As the name implies, this pneumonia doesn't require being in the hospital. Children and young adults can often go to school or work. However, before going about normal life, they should see a doctor, get diagnosed and treated, and prevent spreading it to others.   http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Ato...  Insomnia: Symptoms and Causes  Insomnia is a sleep disorder that is characterized by inadequate sleep quality and quantity. People with this sleep disorder have one or more of the following insomnia symptoms:    Difficulty falling asleep   Waking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep   Waking up too early in the morning   Feeling tired upon waking   Sleepiness during the day   Irritability and problems with concentration or memory   http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/gui...|`|kBQnBBV1aa	pie

8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	Please get that cast off as soon as possible, when it comes off he'll need to have his foot examined  by a competent physician.    Over the counter anti-bacterial ointments are not sufficient to treat infections, the danger here is that an infection that gets into the bones will not be readily recognized.     Your husband really would need to be examined by an infection specialist who can do the proper and necessary blood work to determine if an infection is present and if so would need to be put on heavy duty antibiotics.......he can wear a half cast in the meantime.    Please don't play with this, his leg is at stake, I speak from experience. The same thing happened to me due to a cast being put on to tightly and I spent 4 days in the hospital hooked up to around the clock  antibiotic IV's (Tetracycline), I almost lost my leg.|`|2eQlSoY1aa	Hi, when the storm clears, you need to get to a doctor ASAP but here's what you can do in the mean time:    Give him Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to reduce the inflammation.  Keep the leg elevated.  Do NOT use hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound as this is cytotoxic (meaning it kills bad AND good cells).    Keep the area clean and dry.  Putting some antibiotic and light gauze would definitely help but only after you wash with soap and water and dry the affected area.      Of course, IF there is an infection, you'll most likely need a  stronger abx by mouth but you asked for "DIY answers."    Take care.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	oh man, that is tough!  I think the idea that there is still swelling suggests that the cast may be too tight.  The sores are not getting sufficient blood supply so antibiotic ointments and such aren't going to help.  I'm leaning toward cutting the cast off to better the circulation if there's no way to get to the doctor to get another cast.  These ulcers can become necrotic and cause all kinds of bad things if they persist.  Can't you call the doc who applied the cast for advice?|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	cut parts of the cast off where it is tight.  use neosporin.

Other people will watch you appear to soar, but in reality, you will be in a lot of pain that could end up to prove fatal, even if it is just metaphorically.       Stress is usually at the root of all of the above psychological disorders. It also affects us physically as well. Stress has been linked to every disease known to man, including heart disease and cancer. Clearly, it is not a good idea for people to be under stress. But, as human beings, we are going to experience stressful situations. There is no avoiding this fact. Therefore, in order to really be able to help cure ourselves from being stressed out we need to know how to do the following:    ? Identify stressors that affect our daily lives;  ? Eliminate the stressors of which we can free ourselves;  ? Learn to deal with stressful situations in a healthy way     If you are one of the millions of people who are feeling stressed out, you must take a look at the reasons why you are stressed out and try to do what you can to eliminate as much stress as you can from your life.    Try to have positive reactions to stress     Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.|`|5W2rEsvFaa	Yes|`|q1rPAlBLaa	i have an anxiety/depression disorder and im only 16 so age has nothing to do with it....it sounds like its probable that it is an anxiety disorder....but do not confuse anxiety disorder, with panic attacks. they often go hand and hand but not always....anxiety disorders are generally nervouse ticks and can be treated easily with meds....as can panic attacks....     both can be genetic so i would check ur family history for both anxiety and panic disorders and heart problems go to a cardiologist and get your heart checked out    BUT i  honestly think its a temporary anxiety disorder caused by the stress of planning a wedding.    as i said im only 16 but good luck... hope that helps|`|GcWuo9PWaa	It sounds to me that you definately have an Anxiety disorder.

0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	I've had quite a few epidurals, and I'd say that they're uncomfortable rather than overly painful. The worst is when they 'pop' the needle through (you can feel the popping sensation) into the correct area, and it feels like a very quick electric shock passing through your legs.    They will probably make you lie flat on your back afterwards for a couple of hours or so to ensure that there is no fluid leakage from the site and that you do not feel dizzy or sick. You might be a little bit tender, but really there is nothing to worry about.    All the best :-)|`|Run7dyraaa	I had an epidural in 1986 when I gave birth to my son (C section).

My boyfriend asked me to a long time ago and I'll never go back.|`|cYFblmpVaa	i guess 17 years old|`|764Hudunaa	1st off dont tell her to shave be nice and polite. ask her if you can bathe with her  and offer to do it for her. if she really likes oral, just tell her you dont like hair in your mouth and for you to do this and really enjoy it would she please shave. as for being clean whether she is shaved or not isnt going to make her clean. she should clean up before you have sex anyway, so should you! it makes things better not having to worry about any odors or surprises. she may not be aware many of us guys like it trimmed tight or shaved clean|`|38r67Civaa	okay, it's her body.<br>  she should do whatever she wants with it....<br>  & if you were to flat out say:<br>  "shave down there because i hate it."<br>  i'm sure she'd get offended.<br>  <br>  & if you're that bothered, then don't give her oral.|`|f8bba879d02b930f55f403333784e649aa	Wow, this is what your complaining about?

But it's her decision. Girls--and I'm not speaking for all girls--don't really think about that. We do our nails and shave our legs, but that's not something we really, you know, tend to care about. It's her decision. If she won't get rid of the hair, then there's nothing you can do about it.|`|yDb645Oaaa	To tell you the truth.. that's ridiculous that you want her to shave that area! If she doesn't want to... she doesn't HAVE to. I mean sure it would be nice and all but think, guys in the 1980's loved the pubic hairs! Why has it change so much. Your not actualy suppose to shave down there anyways. Just be happy about her body and don't make her change it.|`|dvevk1qbaa	just tell her to trim it , or clean it up so its funner for you to"have your way with her"<br>  <br>  ask her if she wants you to do the same<br>  <br>  act like its something you guys can do together...maybe offer to take her to a day spa to do it...and throw in a  facial, and not the dirty kind lol...|`|XRXNhaJAaa	Tell her that it would be more pleasant for both of you if she trimmed her area below. DONT force it...the minute you try to force it, the minute she shuts down and then you have a bad argument on your hands. Think of something creative..like it turns you on to think of her shaved, or something to that effect. Be safe! Hope this helps.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	From a women's point of view it's a hard thing to do but I would never go back. I'd say do it with her. Shave yourself with her.

It's her body and her decision. If you can't accept her the way she is then why are you with her? Did you ever think that maybe she enjoys being a woman and having pubic hair?|`|9POUmVMGaa	You may have to make the sacrifice and do it too so she isn't alone on this.

Maybe even twice a day. Basically due to the nature of the job I do. Hot and sweaty and covered in oil alot. Lol. But seriously, depends on how mingy you are.|`|ihLqgVGuaa	Its disgusting.  Your body produces a lot of waste in a day, so even skipping a shower on a quiet sunday isn't very hygienic.  This is espesially true for men.  You go to the bathroom(1 and 2) multiple times a day, and the associated parts become rather filth and bacteria infested and should be cleaned on a daily basis.|`|i4I0cuudaa	It's OK but a strange question.|`|BEac9ZFkaa	u wont stink,u'll feel clean too  gud enuff reasons i guess|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	Yeah, no problem.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Its ok in a cold climate|`|cYsPx9sSaa	its alrite as long as the sweat doesnt start dripping =D
xnZi0i8saa	Very similar situation as mine....... My mother refused (still refuses) to recognize that anything ever happened even though she knew about it at the time, she blamed me for it and treated me like I was a dirty little girl. Now she acts like I am lying and she was a perfect mother and I am horrible for saying anything. She is really twisted. All I ever wanted from her was an apology, which I never did get. In the end I cut off contact and concentrated on helping myself overcome the abuse and the feelings of abandonment she left me with. Now...... I'm ok. <br>  <br>  Don't expect her to receive you well. She may deny everything and continue to blame you. It may be more important to help yourself through counseling...... your mother is unlikely to change. It's not your fault........|`|dINfAO02aa	Good for you, make sure you tell her that you are doing this to move on with your life. I really hope everything goes well for you.|`|85Aa4NHsaa	If it was not your mother who molested you what are you confronting her with.  I can only imagine how difficult it would be for a mother to face the fact that she failed you by letting you be molested and maybe your mother just is not able to handle it.  I am not defending her but I myself was molested as a child and in no way do I feel that my mother is responsible.  The molester is to blame and unfortunately we are left to deal with the aftermath.  I find no comfort in trying to place blame.  I just try and deal with the scars caused by it and maybe you need to seek help in doing so.  My prayers are with you and I hope all works out for you.|`|764Hudunaa	see a psychologist for your own self dont count on your family to help you with this. do it for your own well being
uc0CYzpLaa	Hmmm well I feel you ):  i'm feeling that right now too.  They expect you to put trust into them  when they don't put any into you.  not fair.  but life isn't fair  =/  soooo just try to keep your head held high and  be try and be positive. think about the good things in your life  and try to get away from your parents every so often.  it helps.  or just go in your room and just try and cool off and vent whenever they frustrate you.  =] hope you cheer up hun.  Everyone deserves to be happy, and that's including you.|`|4THbLmvoaa	you should talk to someone else that you are close with.. like a good friend or teacher or someone that will take you seriously..|`|0892ed1cd4da457e97d205b608ac700eaa	I think you are very negative person. All your answers are rude. You assumed my youngest wife was 14. Try to be positive about life I know it's not as easy as it sounds, Do at least one random act of kindness per day. And finally read this:     Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,   and remember what peace there may be in silence.     As far as possible, without surrender,   be on good terms with all persons.   Speak your truth quietly and clearly;   and listen to others,   even to the dull and the ignorant;   they too have their story.   Avoid loud and aggressive persons;   they are vexatious to the spirit.     If you compare yourself with others,   you may become vain or bitter,   for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.   Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.   Keep interested in your own career, however humble;   it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.     Exercise caution in your business affairs,   for the world is full of trickery.   But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;   many persons strive for high ideals,   and everywhere life is full of heroism.   Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection.   Neither be cynical about love,   for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,   it is as perennial as the grass.     Take kindly the counsel of the years,   gracefully surrendering the things of youth.   Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.   But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.   Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.     Beyond a wholesome discipline,   be gentle with yourself.   You are a child of the universe   no less than the trees and the stars;   you have a right to be here.   And whether or not it is clear to you,   no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.     Therefore be at peace with God,   whatever you conceive Him to be.   And whatever your labors and aspirations,   in the noisy confusion of life,   keep peace in your soul.       With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,   it is still a beautiful world.   Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.|`|DM3xodfqaa	wat caused it first!!! moron|`|ClCWpYkSaa	go ask your school counsler what to do sweetie|`|D7qzuS0Laa	yea, don't say that....  you dont hate ur life, you just dont like it right now....  ive felt that way before, and trust me....its not worth it.....|`|hJ89GlgBaa	i dont understand your question...|`|f89e7a5b56d3b4714ed4e14a2765ea08aa	Depression is perfectly normal for a growing teenager.

If you can't get to a doctor, there are over-the-counter medications you can take to improve your mood health. I have tried both Sam-E and St. John's Wort and have liked the both equally. Both take effect within about a week or two.    Be careful, if you are on birth control, you need to use Sam-E as SJW keeps the bc from working correctly.|`|K91HXtKYaa	the parents not believing you...I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM! It's okay, you just need to step back look at what is wrong and talk to one person in particular. Obviously you are going to have to pull yourself out of this one, and there are people (such as counselors even though everyone hates that word) that make it their job to help you. If you are under 18, Doctor is probably out but get one person that will completely talk you through it and make sure they are someone who won't bring you down farther! Good Luck!!!|`|2WtuWrqlaa	you know, its funny cuz i sometimes or most of the times feel the same way...but if yor a christian praying and trusting that god is going to bring through will most certainly help you...and just like there are times when i get impatient on trying ...and i just want to give p..but in the end to make feel better i just think abot the future think about..how great your life will be when your grown and on your own..and thats what keeps me going everday..pray on it..and know tha the best is yet to come!!your never to young!!|`|VDdEMPsdaa	Well, you go away but your depression will still be with you.  Instead, treat it.  1)  Don't take anti depressant, as it doesn't help and just will make you esquizoprehnic.  2)  Go to a Chinese doctor and take they medicine.  -  In my own experience, it worked in 2 weeks!  The depression of 2 years was treated in 2 weeks and with no side effects.  3)  Stop drink fluoride water (filter it), stop meat and non organic milk, and stop all that are not good for the health of the body and the mind.  4)  do exercises, sweating make detox our body thus make us healthy.  5)  read good books.  good luck.|`|IKSbgEMmaa	wow thats aid girl get over yourself|`|qq804CE8aa	Then talk to your school counselor or your minister.  You need help.|`|07YBD5mJaa	you'll know better than anyone else if your depressed. If your parents aren't taking you serious when you tell them, maybe consult a school counselor or a teacher you trust. Depression is hard to face on your own...with a counselor or teacher you can at least have some one to talk out your problems and have someone to help you out, without admitting you to a hospital. after a while i would try consulting your parents once more, express to them that you'd like you see a doctor or a physiologist to seek more help. stay strong, i know it's hard, but keep your head high! best wishes!|`|RApHGrmQaa	uh okay thats nice but uh so what was you question? THAT SERVED ABSOLUTLY NO PURPOSE but i am sorry you are under depression don't go emo and cut yourself that is very bad|`|fE3EDHa4aa	then tell someone other than your parents like your guidance couselor or someone who will listen to you...because obviously your parentts believe what they want to believe not what is actually going on.|`|6vlNSK3uaa	Talk to an adult who you trust.

pujlEZuqaa	If you hit your head as hard as you think and it was yesterday and you are still dizzy and having headaches then yes! you need to see a doctor, you could have a concusion wich can be very serious. They also can get worse over time like you said you didnt feel bad at first.     I would suggest that you tell your mother you want to go to the emergency room. If you have insurance your mother has no reason to not take you.|`|6X4rh4JXaa	you should go no matter what since you hit your head
AA11404742	Not by any major amount.  We have a huge problem facing us in just getting medical care to the people of the world as it is.  Increasing the lifespan in the next 20 years in any major way would entail developing that process in the lab, and implementing it through the health system across the world (or at least major parts of it) in a big hurry.  <br>  <br>  Think of it this way - we've known about AIDS for over 20 years, and developed ways to treat it or at least keep it at bay and in remission.  Yet some places in Africa have infection rates such that maybe 1 out of 3 or 4 people are infected.  If we can't get treatment to these people, how will we deliver a way to keep them alive for say 100 years?|`|UFR9y0ELaa	huh <br>  wtf <br>  if u mean live longer : )<br>  then hopefully <br>  : )
4j5B3N4Raa	Everyone has creatine in them, so maybe just lower the reccomended dose on the bottle of creatine you get. <br>  <br>  Some natural diuretics would be good like drinking more water, no salt and natural products and herbs that help you get rid of water weight.<br>  <br>  The best kind of creatine is Kre-Alkalyn. Monohydrate makes you hold water between the muscles and fat. Kre-Alkalyn holds water IN the muscle so it still gets you bigger but it doesnt look bad. <br>  <br>  Cycle creatine on and off for 2 months on 1 month off for best results|`|G1OSlub8aa	With creatine, you will retain some water. Creatine is not a muscle enhancer, it is for energy. Your body produces creatine for ADP ( andenosine tri phosphate) your bodys energy system, alonng with glucose and oxygen. Creatine supplements alow you to work out longer and harder for better gains. A water pill will get rid of bloating from creatine. The only supplement I would suggest is Protein if you work out intensly and work out often. Time/patience/practice  and dedication will give you results for athletic performance|`|tIldpr7vaa	no, its for muscle building and muscle recovery|`|rwXcLTNvaa	It makes you look muscular, but it gives you waterweight which is hard to get rid off. The negative of creatine is when you become dependant on it and then stop using it, your muscles will return to the way they were after a few months.

AA10199189	you have a sleep debt.    for whatever reason - and you will know- you have not been getting sufficient sleep.  the need for sleep does not go away - when you only sleep three hours one night you have to make up the rest another night -     when you have nightmares etc. that indicates that your sleep debt is significant and that the previous night's problematic sleep has sent you over the edge.    you should get 5 or 6 cycles (90 minutes each) per night.  once you have made  good your sleep debt you will feel refreshed, wake up without an alarm clock and  know whether 5 cycles will do, or whether you need 6.    good luck!|`|eoGBWU3Oaa	There are many possible reasons for this. One of them is that because of your sleep deprivation, you do not get enough REM sleep, which is the time of your sleep cycle in which you dream. Dreams can help to sort out the events of your previous day and to resolve any issues that are still in your mind.     So, from this, it is possible that when you get a good nights sleep after a night of sleep deprivation, your body compensates for the lack of REM sleep by having a longer and deeper REM sleep, which can cause sleep walking and talking.     Hope that helps!|`|72MZ0EG7aa	I would like to know the same thing.I get that way too.  I think it is unbalance of the brain though.You need to eat proper as well as sleep in a regular pattern for your brain to function properly. Good luck maybe someone else has a better answer.

If not, maybe just take one Tylenol pill instead of the 2 prescribed on the bottle?     But i'd still highly recommend you ask a grown-up first, just to be on the safe side, cause these things have to do with your kidneys and the way they function, and some other body parts.     hope you feel better, though. :)|`|c4sn6g3xaa	You need your parents approval.   I don't recommend it.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	you need to check with your parent before you take ANYTHING, it would not hurt you, my 11 year old brother got braces and took some the other night but its still good practice to never take anything with out permission
tZ06ifkDaa	I had mine today ;]  and also,there's two, but alot of people will have had them in previous years. MMR- (measles, mumps and rubella) and Tetnus, Polia and Diptheria are all in one injection.    Tuberculosis (TB) is the one we don't have to have anymore because it is more rare and can be treated alot more easily through a course of antibiotics. They often dont offer it.    When your 17 / 18, you get a course of cervical cancer jabs (if your female obviously!).|`|AA11259545	Just a small correction, the DPT vaccine is for diptheria, pertussis, and tetanus, not polio which is a totally different vaccine.|`|QTZd2vVAaa	I just had mine today!!! omg im in pain now!! the injection did not hurt at all but now its really heavy and painul!! It is a Diptheria tetanus and polio all in one and maybe an MMR booster but not many people have that. I think you may be talking about TB, it is reccomended only if your grandparents were born outside of the UK, it really does hurt and you get a big scab :/    Good Luck

I've had three that I know of, and got hiccups two of those times.  Only one was serious, where I kept getting horrible tweaking head pains for 3? weeks while I waited for an MRI (I had HMO insurance at the time, which is why I had to wait so long), but it had basically cleared up by the time I had the MRI.<br>  <br>  The main typical symptom is feeling "stupid" for awhile.  Almost like you're drunk.  Its probably no big deal, but it wouldn't hurt to have it checked out.  Myself, I'd probably wait until the next day, unless you start throwing up or feeling faint.|`|ntPUkeaNaa	I've had many concussions. Once you get one it's easier to get another. My first one I had I blacked out then started seeing double. Like a split screen. Then some purple and black dots started filling my vision and I had to lay down till the next day. It is just like a really bad migraine. When your head swells it is a good sign. When it doesn't swell, that is when you need to worry. Because it swells inside your skull.

But also, he seems like he may be somewhat of a player because he has a girl and yet he's still going after you. So really there's two ways to interpret this...<br>  way 1) he likes you alot more then his girlfriend<br>  way 2) he is a player and just wants alot of action and doesnt look at   you when he's with his girlfriend because he wants both of you meaning your only as important as the girlfriend he is already with and hey, he's thinking about cheating on her...so it makes him seem untrustworthy.|`|rZA6JRBVaa	If you wanna get ******, then talk to him, otherwise he looken to be a playa *** *****|`|h1e6TvFpaa	your in a bad situation

Check everything you eat or drink to see if it has aspartame in it.|`|n9Oq6Xigaa	It could be something as simple as eating an unhealthy diet, try cutting out fats and sugars, eat plenty of fruit and drink sufficient fluids.  It sounds silly to say that you may need more exercise but this can actually increase your energy levels. Presumably your blood tests would have shown up any medical problems such as anaemia, diabetes or hormone deficiency.  You may be depressed or just lack stimulation.  Review your lifestyle.

Typically, in the first 24 weeks, systolic (the first number) commonly drops 5 - 10 points and the diastolic (lower number) by as much as 10-15.     I think an important question to ask would be, what is your normal BP?     Are you having symptoms of hypotension: lightheadedness or dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, nausea, cool/pale/clammy skin, fatigue, thirst... ?    I would suggest that if you are concerned to see your physician. If you aren't having any symptoms of hypotension I'd monitor your BP every day and if it drops lower than 100 systolic I'd make an appt with the physician. If you typically have a BP that's 140/85 or higher I'd see your doc.. If it's typically 110/75 then monitor and act based on findings and feelings.
Ep7fwAtFaa	I have cut for years. I do it because I have so much emotional pain and I never learned how to deal with it. I would rather feel physical pain and once I see blood I feel more relaxed. Until I start feeling guilty for cutting so then I do it over and over again until I find someone to help!|`|CeBL3HwPaa	Well, i'm 16 and my girlfriend cuts herself sometimes, and I have before..  The main reason people cut themselves is over the stress of being sad, If you take it out on yourself then the worries seem to deminish for a while, it calms you down to tell yourself you messed up and not to do it again. I had to tell her to stop smoking pot.. I wouldn't tollerate it and she stopped. she cut her self a 6 times but, never did pot again.|`|a2HgB81Haa	I don't know if there's a common theme, but I used to cut.

I think got a second oppinon and he said he doesn't believe in pulin out teeth because it destorys the jaw movement or something.    instead of pullin out teeth I got 2 plates that went inside and push all my teeth slighty outwards so the teeth could fit in. like it didn't push them out so I had buc teeth or anything but yeah. then I got my braces after that 2 straighten them.    it did cost more but, it's much better for your body.    id recoomend findin a dentist that doesit this way.
tfTQ6Cuuaa	It depends on your Rx and the type of lens you get. If your Rx is very high then the lens will be thicker and may not fit into your frame. Likewise, if you want a progressive lens, you have to make sure your lens is high enough to have room for both strengths, but it doesn't sound like you need them.     Take the frames to the optician after you have your exam (you will need a current Rx which requires an exam every year) and just tell them you would like to provide the frame, and only purchase the lenses and have them edged into the frame. You will have to pay for your lenses and they may charge you an edging fee. Some do, some don't.     We do it all the time.|`|RJkYRaccaa	as long as they are either plastic, or if metal, have little screws to take out the lenses. without screws on a metal frame, the lenses cannot be changed    1) if you are wanting your current lenses inserted into a new frame, this is inadvisable and not commonly done. your original lenses were cut specifically for the frame they are in. re-cutting them leads to a high chance that the prescription will be "off" thus leading to bad visual acuity    2) recognize that if your frame breaks, unless the same frame is still available, you will be stuck with a worthless (and most likely expensive) pair of lenses without a frame.    3) the cost of your prescription lenses varies from the material to the coatings, etc.. wal-mart is pretty cheap, but i'm not sure what type of quality they offer

AWrR0vunaa	Hi, Id suggest you look around in the internet for services around your area. Check out this link http://www.fsasf.org/programs/adults.htm... Its a website just for people in San Francisco. It all depends on how old you are and personal situation. If you are 21 and under you might qualify for Medi-Cal through your local Social Security or Social Servics office. If you don't qualify for that you can get a referral from your SSI office for a MSI program. That is for people 21 or 22 and up. With a limited income or non at all. This program offers free andlow cost medical services. This is how it works over here in the OC I don't know how San Fran. works. Good Luck!|`|AA11788494	Contact your social service office.  I was able to see a counselor for ten dollars.  I don't live in your area and you may have other resources offered there.

bZtIquTLaa	I feel so bad for you because I know firsthand that depression is truly one of the hardest illnesses to deal with because it's mostly all mental.  When I was depressed I hated everything, had no motivation and contemplated suicide many times.  I'm gonna say this, time and support can do wonders......more than meds or therapy.  Though therapy is also very effective to get to the source of the depression.  Just bear with him for as long as you can but do not forget about your own life.  You can only do so much and the rest is really on the individual.  What really helped me was when it started to look and feel like I was letting people down and disappointing my loved ones.  Sometimes tough love is where it's at.  Hopefully he will see that you and others need him as much as he needs you and it will make him realize why he needs to pick himself up and live.|`|XcS2pXOfaa	Well, I don't know much about Danish sick leaves, but the best thing you can do is cheer him up. Do some things with him. Do you know the cause of his depression? It would help to attack that cause and make him happy again by eliminating that factor in his life. But, of course, don't listen to everything I say (i've never had an encounter with depression so I might be wrong, and i don't want to ruin someone's life). But whatever is egging on his depression, I suggest trying to get rid of it.  Good luck!|`|RsAVOLg7aa	You can't say anything to make him better.  The guy has issues that YOU CAN'T fix!  Dump him!  He sounds like he's using he system and he's using you.  Why would you want to support a grown man?  If he's truly depressed he can try counseling, medication, exercise...and move on with life.  Don't condemn yourself to supporting a man who you will have to walk on eggshells around and who doesn't give back.

An easy fix for bad breath whereever you go is any type of minty gum, nowadays you can even get extra strong for really bad breath.Or just bring along peppermints.|`|ORjjS1SZaa	you can get an extra strength toothpaste, or talk to your dentist they might diagnose you with some kind of bacterial problem.|`|7Yzk6EbGaa	mint?|`|nz8o3lLSaa	My dog had this problem.  He would always drink from the toilet and lick his crotch.  The smell was actually caused by small bacterial colonies caught in the crevices of his mouth.

After you get them out you are going to find brushing pretty uncomfortable and you may go a day or so with out brushing at all.

Maybe more. I'd stick to plain old, it's much more realistic. See, who you were in another life - even a so-called famous one - has nothing to do with who you are NOW. That's something those ego-testical people seem unable to realise.|`|9NSfJChaaa	You are what you are.  You can't change the past.

YeWrtZIraa	I have this same problem, except I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm an extrovert. Over the past couple of years, my once high-self esteem has taken a nose-dive and is MUCH lower than it used to be. This is what I'm doing to help myself feel better:<br>  <br>  I'm trying not to spend too much time on the computer. If you're on social networking sites (like Myspace or Facebook)...either delete your accounts or try not to log-in very often. Too much social networking can leave you feeling drained and depressed!<br>  <br>  Try to get outside more. If it's a beautiful day, go for a walk with a friend, go to the park...go do something instead of staying at home.<br>  <br>  Try to do small things to boost your appearance (not because you need to, but because they make you feel better). Painting your nails or doing something new with your hair  are examples.<br>  <br>  Try to stay busy so you don't think about your insecurities. If you're at home with nothing to do, read a book or watch a movie instead of watching tv. Creating art is a good distraction, too. Or find a program after school.<br>  <br>  Remember the times when you've been complimented on something. Think of times when you've laughed with friends or someone did something that made you happy. When you start to have a negative thought, try to mentally block it out of your head.  <br>  <br>  Exercise. This will automatically boost your self-esteem.<br>  <br>  Get good sleep. If you're going to bed too late and getting up early, this could be making you more depressed. Sleep is the key to your sanity!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ViuhdFDIaa	I can assure you there's nothing wrong with you. You are certainly not alone in feeling this way as it's very common for people at young age to lose confidence in themselves. The best way to deal with such problems is to talk about them with someone trustworthy (a parent or a friend). You should look into ways of buidling up your confidence and not care so much about what others think of you. Other things that can help are: >making a list of all your good qualities and traits<br>  >being sociable. The more you're around with people the more comfortable you'll feel!|`|ItQOLOSXaa	You have to find stuff that will make you feel good about yourself, that will let the real you be known. Playing/writing music, writing, walking, study something you've always wanted to know about, etc. A lot of people have low self-esteem/confidence, but they don't let it wear them down, because life is too precious to waste.|`|vut2ZCApaa	i think you should should do daily self affirmations. they are positive messages that you tell yourself. you know who you are, and you should emphasize to yourself that you are doing things right.

Periods tend to run down your hormones, it sucks.|`|c9Hw3bt4aa	Yes, that is normal.  Your hormones and the fact that you are losing blood (decreases your iron levels).

They dont want you to see them weak and not coping etc. They feel they should appear normal or fine.    You cant force him to get help. He has to want to help himself. Perhaps making subtle suggestions to him would a good way to start and maybe it will put ideas in to his head. He needs to make the decision to get help though, on his own.     My brother is the same. I would only get anything out of him cos he is my brother and we are close but i still have to question him to get some sort of conversation out of him.     I think all you can do is keep an eye on his mood and if he gets worse, try to get him to see a doctor again. He must be on drugs of some sort...is he taking them, if he is some drugs to treat it he maybe stopping them suddenly when he feels ok and then of course yo get ill again.    visit him often or if he lives with you chat to him more about general things. why not off to take him to see a film?  try encourage him go out and do things with you. even if it the cinema or the supermarket shopping, or may dinner out with you?    xxxx|`|iybezfi6aa	Is it the promoted position that he is finding so stressful?

My resource is all from FACT, and is proven, I will explain a little.<br>  <br>  Normal fatty foods are not a problem in general, this is because the fat molecules can be broken down by the enzymes in your body and used. Your problem is carbohydrates. I could launch into a load of statistics about how overweight problems are linked with this etc, however we are going to focus on YOU and what you can do, if you need to find out the ideal healthy diet.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are split into two groups.<br>  <br>  Complex Carbohydrates - these, you get form vegetables, and you get enough of them. Your body can break these down and use them.<br>  <br>  Simple Carbohydrates - these are present in all foods with grains. This includes bread, pasta, all pastries doughnuts etc, potatoes, wheat containing products, flour.<br>  <br>  Simple carbohydrates cannot be broken down by your body, and so are converted to a type of fat molecule which your body cannot use, and stored in your liver and muscles. Now, your liver and muscles barely have the capacity for this - so the next place for it to be stores, is as excess fat in your skin tissue - this making you overweight.<br>  <br>  Completely eliminate grains from your diet, eat plenty of vegetables, and I can guarantee that within a week, you will see an improvement in your weight and overall health. <br>  <br>  You can read a full article on this here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://curedbynature.blogspot.com/2009/02/importance-of-diet-carbohydrates-not.html" rel="nofollow">http://curedbynature.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a><br>  <br>  Do not overlook this, you will definitely regret it later.

CondWoI3aa	I don't think you should bring it up in casual conversation, but you need to be honest about yourself. You aren't your diagnosis, so just try letting your date get to know the real you i.e. talk about your interests etc. If he asks you something where you have to be honest about your condition, just tell him.<br>  <br>  Sadly, most people are quite ignorant about mental health issues, and will form an immediate judgement about you. Not everyone is like that though, so it is possible to find someone who will accept you as you are.<br>  <br>  As far as the Internet goes, it's extremely difficult to get people to understand your difficulties, due to the nature of this means of communication. The same principle still applies though - just be honest about yourself, but try not go into too much detail.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|05SbMDA6aa	I don't think you need to worry about telling someone your health issues on a first date. That is what dating is for, the period when he will get to know you. Let him get to understand you as a whole person first before introducing your your fears! I'm sure once he see's that you are a great person regardless he will understand that you also manage an illness... telling him on a first date when even those who don't have health issues are on 'best behaviour' could be too soon for them, letting them judge you without knowing who you are first. If you feel you would like to get it 'out of the way with' then just say that you have had some feelings of negativity in the past without going into too much detail.

When you are first dating a guy they only need to get to know you for your personality, your depression doesnt define who you are.  There's also the privacy aspect.  You're disclosing something very personal to someone who may not be part of your life for much longer, but could still walk away knowing that info about you!  I think the right time to tell someone is when it looks like it may be a serious and long term thing.  That's just my opinion, but I dont think disclosing as soon as the first date is ever necessary or appropriated.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	It's very personal, but then again it probably wasn't a good idea to berate yourself by saying he'd have been better off with someone else.

Ice stops injuries by reducing swelling, but what you have isn't an injury, it's just the process of your muscles rebuilding.    When you work out anaerobically, straining yourself, your muscles tear themselves up trying to do the work you're asking them to do.  That night and the next day etc they rebuild stronger and this is the soreness.  Heat helps them relax, but as you can probably infer from the situation nothing but time will fix you up.      Stretching does help loosen you up though, and may take the pain away.  Also makes you feel like you're tough.  You can work out the day after a heavy workout, it will just take some warming up and you shouldn't do it often.  For school sports however, you should do everything the coaches ask of you and then some.

A few people have symptoms that are persistent and severe, in some cases requiring treatment with additional medicines or surgery.<br>  <br>  The goals of treatment include:<br>  <br>      * Relieving symptoms and ending sudden (acute) attacks as quickly as possible.<br>      * Treating complications, such as anemia or infection. Treatment may include taking nutritional supplements to restore normal growth and sexual development in children and teens.<br>      * Preventing or delaying new attacks.<br>  <br>  Initial treatment<br>  <br>  If you don't have any symptoms of ulcerative colitis or if your disease is not active (in remission), you may not need treatment. If you do have symptoms, they usually can be managed with medicines to put the disease in remission. It often is easier to keep the disease in remission than to treat a flare-up.<br>  <br>  Mild symptoms may respond to antidiarrheal medicines and changes in your diet. Sometimes you may need to use enemas or suppositories. Talk with your health professional before taking antidiarrheals. Prescription medicines may be used to treat mild symptoms and keep the disease in remission. Usually, corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) are given for a few weeks to control active disease.<br>  <br>  When your symptoms are under control, you may take aminosalicylates (such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine) to keep the disease in remission. Aminosalicylates relieve inflammation in the intestines.<br>  <br>  Moderate to severe symptoms usually require corticosteroids to control inflammation. The required dose of steroids may be higher than that needed to treat mild colitis. When inflammation goes away, you will take aminosalicylates to keep the condition in remission. For more information about making good food choices, see:<br>  <br>      Eating plan for inflammatory bowel disease.<br>  <br>  Immunomodulator medicines, such as azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), also may be needed for severe cases that cannot be controlled with aminosalicylates alone. These medicines suppress the body's immune system to prevent inflammation. Immunomodulators also may be needed to avoid long-term use of steroids, which can cause side effects such as increased risk of infection and osteoporosis.<br>  <br>  For severe ulcerative colitis, when corticosteroids don't work, your doctor may have you try infliximab. Infliximab (Remicade) may work to put you in remission when other medicines don't. Infliximab has also been shown to help heal the lining of the intestine.<br>  Ongoing treatment<br>  <br>  The goal of ongoing treatment is to keep ulcerative colitis from causing symptoms (keep it in remission). Most people take aminosalicylates (such as sulfasalazine or mesalamine) to prevent symptoms from recurring. Aminosalicylates relieve inflammation in the intestines. If you do have flare-ups, you will be given corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) to control the inflammation.<br>  <br>  Usually, steroids are given only long enough to control inflammation. If your condition is so severe that aminosalicylates alone cannot keep you in remission and you would need long-term use of steroids, you may take immunomodulator medicines (such as azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or cyclosporine). These strong medicines suppress the immune system to prevent inflammation.<br>  <br>  If these medicines don't work, your doctor may have you try infliximab (Remicade). Infliximab also blocks the inflammatory response in your body and helps reduce the inflammation in your colon.<br>  <br>  Your health professional will want to see you for a follow-up visit about every 6 months while your condition is stable and more frequently if you are having problems. If you are taking medicines, you may have laboratory tests every 2 to 3 months. Many people who have ulcerative colitis are so familiar with the course of their condition that they can handle minor flare-ups on their own. In some cases, you may be able to consult with your health professional on the phone for minor problems.<br>  Treatment if the condition gets worse<br>  <br>  You may have to receive treatment in the hospital if you have severe, persistent ulcerative colitis with symptoms outside the digestive tract, such as fever or anemia. Treatment includes replacing fluids and electrolytes lost because of severe diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Your health professional may increase your dose of corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) to control active disease or may increase your immunomodulator medicines (such as azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or cyclosporine) or infliximab to suppress your immune system.

The size and color should match perfectly with the rest of your teeth. They will probably go through many teeth to find ones that match well. The size can be adjusted by them using a bur to shapen it. (They can also make them look more natural).    The should ask your opinion to make sure you think they look as natural as possible. The best way to see if the color is good, is to go outside and check it in natural lighting. (A trick I've learned over the years).     Needless to say, if something does not look or feel right make sure you tell them. You are paying probably some good money to be having all this, so you need to let them know if you think there is a problem.    I am sure you will look great with those teeth in, just be careful eating until you get used to them....    Good luck to you!!!

They really won't care  If you keep getting re infected then you should look at your hygene routine.You may well be in contact with people that are less than hygenic.If you are still at school make sure that you carry anti-bac hand gel and use it after you touch the public toilet seat and handle in the loos.  Good Luck I'm sure you will get rid of them .|`|6UmRmaeWaa	There is no reason you should be getting pinworms on and off for years. This is a big deal and your parents need to take you to a new doctor if he is just giving you antibiotics over and over again. Your Body will know that it is trying to fight off the pinworms and it will begin not to work any more. Not to mention down the road if you really need that type of antibiotic your body will be immune to it. If I were you...    Go to a new Doc!|`|d1guDJzyaa	What the hell are pinworms???
01Mu3wUeaa	"Norwalk virus"  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|mYGbxuCAaa	go to the doctor he/she will tell you, but unless you kssed this woman or something i wouldnt worry|`|wDrvsdEHaa	Woah did this seriously happen in town. I woulda freaked out lol (emetophobic). There is a very very small chance that you might have caught it if it was the norovirus. Yes, I would be really worried but thats normal for me. Take a few vitamins and drink lots of water over the next few days. If your bf was near her then I would stay away from him for a few days if he feels sick or anything. But yeah dont worry about it (I know it hard not to).     =)

TO4bRflyaa	Chris, do not jump to conclusions without consulting a doctor. Its most likely that the marijuana incident had a profound effect on you. Confide in your parents and tell them to take you to a psychiatrist.    Your mind is only reacting to environmental factors and the depression/anxiety is making it worse. Confirm with the doctor if you would have to take any medications. You will do fine.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	NO not at all you are not mentally ill, most likely it's anxiety yes anxiety can cause you to have irrational thoughts (please don't listen to the jackass who made the 1st comment) but yeah when you have these persistent unwanted thoughts it's hard for your mind to forget because the undertone of the thought itself is (fear of insanity) that's whats keeping you on this particular thought//but I'm going through the same exact thing!! And the very fact that your even considering there might be something wrong mentally is a indicator that your perfectly normal......when ppl have these mental conditions they usually don't even realize it!!! & 9x out of 10 you have to be born like that....but environmental factors can also play a role but mostly likely you have to be born like that|`|F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.

The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.

A slightly elevated temperature of 99.8 to 100 wouldn't be significant in someone whose normal body temperature is 98.6 but can indicate a high fever for someone with a lower than normal body temperature.

She tends to stick to popsicles and italian ice, but if she's hospitalized, they don't allow her to have even water.<br>  <br>  Just be very careful, stick to liquids, and don't eat too much at once.

In the end, I think it is best to stick with healthy eating and exercise.

But 700 calories is not enough, you should really keep it at around 1300. If you starve your body you will never lose weight. The body feels as if it is in starvation mode, not knowing when it will get its next meal, then it holds on to the fat even longer. I suggest you go to Oxygenmag.com and read up on how to eat healthy. It is a workout mag for women.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	Start making healthier food choices for the rest of the day and concentrate on eating healthier tomorrow. Seven calories a day is not healthy. You do not need to starve yourself because that can lead to major pigout sessions and can be bad for your health. The key to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume. You actually need to eat MORE calories a day. Exercise regularly. Be kind to your body, don't stress about calories but do have an idea of how many you consume, get plenty of sleep, drink enough water, and exercise. The trick is to have a healthy lifestyle and not obsess over calories. :o)|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	dont worry you drank so much water anyway it will probably be flushed out anyway, theres not much you can but dont just dont throw it back up, exercise more tomorrow, 700 calories isn't really enough calories maybe you could add some in healthy ways like fruits so they aren't stored as fat. <br>  good luck with your weight loss. hope i helped :)|`|nqPVkVnPaa	Well TBH it is your own fault for eating ONLY 700 cals a day - to sustain a certain calorie target it has to be reasonable...so go for around 1400-1700 cals a day - that way it wont come back and bite you (i.e give in to a binge) as you will have enough calories to be Content - and put in some exercise...anything from gym'ing - to home sit-ups..running on the spot..w/e gets your heart beat going for at least 1/2 an hour a day.<br>  <br>  GL!<br>  <br>  PS a one off binge will not do too much - just don't make it a persistant thing...|`|6gthdHpnaa	Really, there's not a lot you can do.

I don't know your age or weight, but 1200 calories is considered a low normal intake of calories. You are setting yourself up for losses/gains, whereas a good steady diet of wholesome foods combined with moderate exercise will be much more healthy for you.  And 16 pounds in 4 weeks is too much to lose.|`|Sf3ZFezRaa	Oh dear.|`|WcYRd9DLaa	seek a theripist|`|YJV2TU6taa	Just go back to your normal diet tommorow.

The most you should lose is 2 pounds a week. This can be done through proper diet and exercise. My suggestion is, well first of all, cut down on the pancake binging. What you need to do is cut down around 500 calories in food intake and burn 500 calories by walking or doing any other form of aerobic exercise that you feel comfortable with. Whenever you get hungry or so bored that you want to eat, drink water. But do not starve yourself. Do eat your breakfast, dinner, and lunch. Just in fewer amounts. You will be able to lose 16 pounds in 8 weeks.|`|xoSbUXCLaa	next step is the purgeing|`|qrGLcTh4aa	So? Eating is fun.

eokH64z0aa	As someone else suggested Midol works well. Oh, but what out for the Midol Advanced one [I'm not sure of the actual name - it's in the light red box], because that one is $4 more then the original Midol and all it has in it is a high dose of Naproxen, which you can get from a $3 bottle of Aleve. Plus, regular Midol has medication in it that not only helps with the pain, but also helps with bloating.<br>  <br>  If the pain is really bad talk to your doctor, he/she may prescribe Naproxen [or even something stronger] which helped when I was younger [with me, when I have my period the pain is debilitating - I'm off my feet during those four annoying days and every little movement hurts, but because of this I have Vicodin for that time - that's how bad they get!].<br>  <br>  What also works is Aleve [Naproxen is the key ingredient in Aleve], and when ever you can use a heating pad on your lower stomach, or if you don't have a heating pad, try putting a facecloth in hot water, or if you water doesn't get that hot, put one in cold water and microwave the bowl it's in.

ufgv7oTjaa	You should be able to find Acai in most any health food store, especially since they are a big fad right now. It probably won't say "as seen on Oprah", but Acai is Acai, no matter which company makes it (as long as they are of good quality, of course). To be on the safe side, I would just make sure the company has a good rating with either the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or USP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia), as those are the main quality assurance organizations (USP is for the U.S., GMP is for the U.S. and worldwide).    If you aren't able to find it at any health food stores (which would surprise me), you could order it and have it shipped to you. There are a few good quality companies in the U.S. that ship to Canada, so you could check with http://www.swansonvitamins.com http://www.vitacost.com or http://www.puritanspride.com for good deals as well.  Good luck!
nEVoabeSaa	I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and some elements of Lupus, test positive for Lupus. However after many years of BS as you correctly say I went to another Country to get out of the BS. The Rheumatologist I saw their suggested I try Evening Primrose Oil, but I will be on it for LIFE and if I stop taking it, will have to start again. It takes about six weeks to kick in, but if I stop for one day, then I am back where I started. I did not I stuck with it and am still here to tell the tale. Evening Primrose Oil is a natural anti-inflammatory and it helps regulate the hormones, which seems to have been the problem. Now 50 I am Menopausal and my health is a lot better than it was in my 30's, my only wish I had know about evening primrose oil back then. Best of Luck|`|WvSUXv3paa	I know something that has helped with chronic pain, But I don't understand scientifically the potential risks involved with therapy of any kind when it comes to lupus.

HBx6q05Oaa	There is a stomach virus going around the US right now so thats probably what she has. First, no milk..it's hard to digest. She should not have anything for a hour after vomiting, then small (1/2cup) of water, wait 15-20 minutes, if she dont throw up drink a little more water. Repeat this exercise until she can hold down fluids without vomiting. This bug usually lasts 24 hrs so it she should be better tomorrow. Try giving her non caffienated products (Sprite) after she tolerates the water. If she develops abdominal pain or fevers, go to the emergency room
Qxh1kPLfaa	I vote for the Alimentum formula also.    Kids who have issues with milk formula can often have issues with soy also.      Lactose free formulas are not for milk allergic children.

uVmwUqhIaa	This pain is normal. You will probably experience this pain for another week or two, depending on how quickly your piercings heal. Remember, you did just PIERCE your ears. There is exposed flesh with a foreign body pressing against it. Continue to clean your piercings as directed, but take extra precaution when moving your earrings. Be gentle and do not mess with with them constantly. For future reference, infection is characterized by pain, inflammation, redness, pus, and heat. If you want to prevent infection, try using Bactine.It is an antiseptic *and* a pain reliever. After cleaning your piercings, just spray the Bactine on. :)|`|LsQF7gcYaa	its gunna hurt a little afer you first get them pirced but just keep washing it with the solution daily and if it gets really red and pussy you sould prob. see a doc.|`|JZ3X3MPUaa	I would say keep an eye on it.

Just be sure to clean and rotate them very gently. Good luck!|`|uaIUBYTcaa	you could have the backs of the earrings to tight. Loosen them a bit the next time you clean them.|`|qv5YTx5kaa	I had the same thing with all four of my ear piercings. It's nothing to worry about.

For an infection it will have white gunk around the earring and be really red.  Make sure you clean it on a regular basis.
tEy2YH8caa	Hi Andrew, I would advise that you see your dentist, as this could be an abcess under the tooth. A dentist will be able to xray the tooth and diagnose a specfic problem.

Hope this helps.|`|t22PZU6Uaa	Go to the dentist - he/she will know what to do|`|rrII5zbDaa	Most, but not all the time, a severe toothache is caused by a tooth needing root canal treatment.

AA12189159	They don't hurt, but if you're in a lot pain, it can be uncomfortable.  I mostly see the chiropractor for my neck and when he adjusts it, it's rather uncomfortable because he has to turn my head in such a way to 'pop' it and it puts pressure right where it hurts, but it's only for a few seconds, then it's almost instant relief.  I would suggest you find a chriopractor that uses a drop table.  This way, they don't have to manipulate your body (i.e. twist and turn you), but instead put hand pressure where you're feeling the pain, then the table you're laying on is raised just a little underneath you and when the chiropractor pushes down, the table gives and aids in the amount of pressure.  If you're holding your breath or tense, it'll feel like the wind was knocked out of you, but I wouldn't call that 'painful'.  So, no, it doesn't hurt, just remember to breath out as they're adjusting and stay relaxed.  And yes, they do help.  If you've got a stiff neck, and/or any kind of back pain, it will almost instantly relieve the pressure that's causing the pain.  The chiropractor I work for says that typically you'll be sore the day after but feel fine on the second day.  Also, I would be wary of chiropractors that want to set up multiple visits for simple back/neck problems or have you buying oodles of supplements (not to say supplements don't help, but there are some chiropractors that use them specifially for extra income).  Sometimes, after a significant fall or care accident or something along those lines, it is necessary you have multiple visits, but it most cases the one time is good enough.  However, if you've let it get really bad, they may suggest a follow-up visit in a few days if you're not feeling better.  I would also recommend that you ask around to people you trust and see if any of them have visited a chriopractor or have relatives that have a regular chiropractor.  That way you're not just picking a name out of the phone book.  Quite a few people that come into our office were sent by friends or family members.  Hope that helps!
KKev7q04aa	The glasses you wear for nearsightedness have concave (or minus) lenses which will make things appear smaller. The stronger the prescription, the greater the size reducing effect will be. This explains the object looking smaller with your glasses on.    As for seeing an object only a few inches from your eyes more clearly  without your distance glasses, keep in mind, they are distance glasses and they may somewhat interfere with looking at things up close. The lenses in your eyes are capable of only a certain range of accomodation, there is a near point (how close you can focus) and a far point (how far away you can focus). Without your glasses, the far point seems to be a few inches. I don't know the near point, but it must be pretty close. With your glasses on, the far point is presumably infinity or nearly so, but the lenses that move your far point back where it belongs, also shift the near point out further as well, hence some difficulty seeing close things with your glasses on. It is nothing to panic about, just it may be a sign that you will need bifocals soon.

The tips of your finger will become more hardened and pretty soon you will be able to play effortlessly.    Will take a month or so for your fingers to adjust. One additional thing you could check is if the distance between the fret board and the strings is too much(makes it difficult to hold down the string) You can get this adjusted!    Also as a general rule keep your finger nails clipped to allow better play.   I found this site useful for guitar related information. http://www.4guysformusic.com|`|1IU0QCquaa	Yes.

You just need to be the alpha. Train them, using treats, to sit next to you and stay. Then, holding the treat, begin walking and praise them for walking next to you. Stop and have them sit. Be the boss!    You could always get them formal training as well.  Good luck!|`|oVTZA6cbaa	wtf min pins are those li'l men created by roald dahl...|`|skWN7jWHaa	It's called a lead go to pet co
UTak66q0aa	I have never heard of this. So I hope this link helps you to answer your question.      This headache arrives from a more complex pattern of problems in the body. This syndrome we call wind-phlegm. The wind portion can be stress induced while the phlegm part most often comes from dietary problems such as a high fat or damp/phlegm producing type diet. The premise here is that you've got too much fat in the blood stream or meridian system and that is getting whipped up by the wind caused by stress. This causes the phlegm to go flying up into the head, causing the type of headache that arrives with a very thick tongue coating and is induced by stress or anger.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Sorry, in 40 years as a therapist I never heard that term.
d1jMmApmaa	If you've already been fully tested for yeast infection, UTI, STD/STIs and received negative results, then you're probably fine in that regard.      Other common causes of vaginal/labial itching (especially without discharge) are, chaffing from underwear, irritation from cleaning agents (soap/clothing detergent/fabric softener), irritation from bathroom tissue/feminine pads, psoriasis, eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis.    To help combat symptoms:  Chaffing: Wear well-fitting white cotton panties whenever possible. (never too tight) After a workout/swim, shower and change panties/swimsuit as soon as possible.  Cleaning Agents: Don't use soap in the vaginal area when showering. If necessary use a feminine wash specially designed for sensitive areas.  Don't use douche.  Wash your panties/swimwear/hosiery with mild, hypo-allergenic detergent & don't use fabric softener.  Bath Tissue/Pads: Make sure all items are unscented & un-dyed  Psoriasis, Eczema, Seborrheic Dermatitis: All are skin conditions that tend to cause itching. Mention your symptoms to your dermatologist to see if any of these conditions are causing your symptoms.    Don't scratch as you'll tear the skin and it'll put you at risk to contract a secondary infection (most commonly staph) in the areas left raw.    In the meantime, oatmeal baths tend to help soothe itchy skin.    Good Luck!  Hope it helps!!|`|6EgjqoqNaa	sweetie that is a yeast infection consult with another doctor but that is a yeast infection|`|Zas9WXNwaa	Even if you've been with the same guy, there is still the potential for an STD.  Either one of you may have been exposed prior to your current relationship.    I'd recommend going back to the doctor & ask for a complete STD screening including herpes (HSV 1 & 2).  Nearly every doctor and clinic only does tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea and HIV unless you ask them to do a complete screening.    Best of luck to you!|`|7o957DMlaa	You should probly go to the doc. just in case    but my advice is to get some yeast infection medicine and put the cream wher it itches..it will relive the itch|`|srj3LwHvaa	go back to the doctors and complain|`|df5zpsWyaa	It could be nothing at all. It may possibly be the soap you are using. Try using Dove white bar or the one for sensitive skin. I used to have the same problem and since I changed soaps it has cleared up. Sometimes the fragrances in the soap are too strong.

To help others by sharing our own experiences and stories?    Sometimes people do have doctor appointments scheduled, they just want to ask anyway. Sometimes it is a young scared teenager, who needs some encouragement to go see a doctor and tell her parents. Sometimes its not a serious issue that doesn't require a doctor visit, they are just getting some opinions. Nobody asks a question on here and expects magic or PhD quality answers. They are just looking for someone who has experienced the same thing.     If it bothers you so bad, then don't answer the question. It's that simple.|`|Q3wDaHITaa	Yes. They especially bother me because they highlight all of the misinformation and nonsense flying around about sex. They also highlight how lackadaisacal people are about having unprotected sex (especially given the amount of STDs floating around)     I always give the same answer.    "If you have had unprotected sex, you could be pregnant.    Please consult your doctor for a pregnancy test AND a full STD test. There are worse things out there than babies.

pqnEavSyaa	Janie, do you wear high heel shoes frequently?  If so, they may have something to do with your ball of foot pain.  Also known as metatarsalgia, it is a common complaint among women wearing high heels and fashion shoes. Pain in this area of the foot may also occur when wearing hard shoes without any cushioning inside, such as work boots.    Metatarsalgia occurs when the metatarsals (forefoot bones) drop and the surrounding ligaments weaken. The entire forefoot structure collapses, in turn leading to excess pressure and friction under the ball of the foot. The key reason for this problem is that when wearing high heels, most of our body weight is resting on the forefoot area.    There are orthotic insoles for high-heeled shoes that restore biomechanical balance by supporting the arch as well as the metatarsal bones. This means that your bodyweight is distributed more evenly over the entire foot, instead of just on the forefoot.    Please read links below for more information:|`|780ByZVEaa	you should ge see a podiatrist they will tell you (you could have a bone spur)

Sledkane, right at the beginning, said 'no you should no give up on your dreams, but you cant give up on your problems'. That doesn't mean that you have 'NO chance to fullfill' your goals. It means you just have to take in consideration reality as well. For example, say if you wanted to become president or something, chances are you won't, that doesn't mean that you're going to live some doomed shitty life forever.    31 isn't old.

When you have got your qualification in IT then search for your dream job abroad and stick two massive fingers up to all who doubted you. Good luck..you can do it.|`|AA11617874	First of all, you seem like you have a good drive. It is true that you have to face reality. But you should make realistic goals or little goals to get to your ultimate goal. You want to get out of the UK, but it seems overwhelming. But you have to do it a little at a time. There's a saying, "How do you eat an elephant?" The answer: one bite at a time.    As far as being too old, don't dwell on it. I have three stories that are true. First, I have a friend that was a couselor for a homeless shelter. He would always see this man in his forties studying math, even with a flashlight in the dark. He went to a community college and is now accepted to an architecture program at a good school. He's about 45! So in a couple of years around 47-48 he will graduate!    Second, I met an elderly gentleman, around 45, who just became a nurse! I was suprised because he used to be a handyman and he decided to go back to school around 40. He finished a four-year nursing degree. But they call him "the Handyman" because he likes fixing stuff around the hospital other than doing his nursing duties.    Finally, my Dad is a good example. Growing up he fixed minor stuff here and there. But at 40 years old, he got into construction and he has some steady work through referrals. He's 65 now and still working!    THe point is, do what you have to do. You seem like the kind of person who doesn't care too much about money, but enrichment for your soul. Have value for yourself and your life. Be an example for anyone who wants to achieve their goals late in life. It's good to change sometimes, right? Look at my President Obama. If he didn't want to change, he would still be a Senator.

I don't look forward to future AT ALL. Unlike normal humans, I live in the present, enjoying what is available to me. These include drugs, girls, movies, and games. I just enjoy myself.    In the present state, I am at my strongest point. I am fearless of death, and I have nothing to lose. I don't even get addicted to any substance I take over long periods of time...

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, you should start to fill out real soon.  A girl's breasts continue to grow til she's about 22 years old.    However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well when you go in for your next check-up.
6CuvgSImaa	Oh honey! I'm 15 and a 34A, I know how you feel! It depends really. If you started your period early (around 10 or 11 like I did) then probably not.

I don't want big boobs, guys stare at them, girls will call you a skank, they give you back problems, and frankly, they get in the way.    My sister is a natural DDD, so I know how it feels to be the odd duck out. Just be confident! If you really are concerned about it, go see your doctor, or wear a padded bra.

There is no way to determine your future growth, or to influence it [beside not stopping your predetermined growth].    If you smoke - STOP.    If your diet has alot of processed foods, fast food, trans-fats and such, start to eat more vegetables.    If you do not execercise aerobically 30+ min 3+ times per week - START.    Take vitamins daily. Make sure you get Calcium & Magnesium Citrate and vitamin D as well.    Take an omega-3 supplement.  Coromega is good for this.    Meditate. Try not to think about growing the whole time.    Be well - don't sweat it - enjoy being who you are.  Worst  case, you can fill them up when you are an adult, but that is a really silly idea.
NWie2UQsaa	Cracking your knees probably isn't the cause. My pop and crack all the time. The cracking you here is from a release of CO2 that builds up in you joints.

Not horrible or anything, but you might bleed a little bit.  After maybe a minute the pain should dull out.  Tell your guy to use lube and go slow.      I'd give it probably a 6.5 or 7.      It feels GREAT!!!...the second or third time.  It's like french kissing...the first time is awful, then after you figure it out it's great.      I was 18 when I did it the first time.  Just know, though, that there is no "Okay, we'll just try it and never do it again until we get married."  Yeah, that's what we said.  And now I'm on birth control and we have an active, great sex life.      And that brings up an important point...unless you want to have a baby 9 months from now, USE BIRTH CONTROL.  USE A CONDOM.  Trojan I know makes a condom that also has spermicide on it; use those if you can.  Condoms are cheap, way cheaper than a baby.  Oh, and if you use a condom, DO NOT USE VASELINE.  Use a water-based lube like KY instead.      One more thing; don't do it just because "everybody's doing it."  I promise, not everybody is out making like rabbits, and if you're not emotionally ready, don't hesitate to hesitate...I mean, don't feel bad about wanting to wait.  I promise you that your relationship will only get more in depth, and if you're not ready for it things will only become more complicated.  Sex is great, but it's so much more gratifying when you deeply love and care for the person you're doing it with.

87CTeVzxaa	Its shouldnt at all.  I was a dental assistant for years and most of the time the nerve in you tooth is already dead.  they will numb the gum around it and it takes a while but it shouldnt hurt at all.  I have seen patients go to sleep and snore while we were doing them. LOL!  Good Luck!|`|fmSuzK2Aaa	The only part of the root canal therapy that hurts is when the dentist or endodontist numbs your tooth and the gums and area around the tooth being worked on and that is just the regular prick that comes with any dental work numbing - so if you've had cavities filled before without a problem, this too should not be a problem. Depending on the tooth being treated will depend on how long it takes - for a molar that has anywhere from 2-5 roots, it can take anywhere from 1-2 hours; but a front tooth that only has 1-2 roots should not take more than 30-45 minutes. Overall, root canal therapy is a great way to take care of that pain and sensitivity existing before the root canal.   When I had my first root canal last week I was freaked out but my endodontist was really great (I recommend going to an endodontist if your insurance will cover it - they specialize in root canals and do it ALL DAY LONG! They have the most advanced technology and really know how to deal with nervous patients like me :) After he finished the root canal he told me that most - if not all - of my pain and sensitivity would be gone by the time the novocaine wore off and he was right!! Root canal therapy is a great alternative to pain and suffering!!|`|tpY9nXbhaa	yes it does|`|qtrO2RSMaa	I had one last year and no it doesn't hurt, but the needle does expecially when it hits a nerve and it feels like a bunch of other needles hitting parts of your mouth/cheek area. It takes 45 min to an hour or so but yeah its pretty boring after... and don't be stupid and eat ice cream like me... lol good luck!

It's not uncomfortable, you don't really notice it really, and it's not unhealthy or anything, but I just don't like it. So I shake it, but if it's still pretty wet then I wipe.     Like everyone else has said, most men shake. Circumcised men are the ones most likely to not shake or wipe though, because they don't feel the need to.|`|AUK3lzEbaa	Yes. What do you mean "real men"?

So yeah though real men don't wipe after peeing, real men also don't play with their weewee when they are suppose to be peeing.    I guess real men are just filthy.

vVfH8yBYaa	Students working on their PhDs are definitely doing research, but they definitely aren't the only ones.    There are many people that have earned their PhDs, and continue to do reasearch, either in conjunction with their jobs as teachers, doctors, etc. For others, reseearch is their main focus.    There are also plenty of people without their PhD that are doing research, cooperating in research, or assisting in other ways.

0fHpGVc8aa	Exercising is a good start to lose weight.  My wife was recently able to drop 20 pounds in 30 days using this new diet pill while also exercising.  The diet pill has been used in Europe for years but just recently came to the US.  I know you can currently try it free for 21 days, here is the link: http://personalplug.com/an/offer/wlp.php    Anyways best of luck in your weight loss efforts :)
UbSJPBuNaa	some people have a low resistance to pain (some of my friends) and it hurts for more time , but it stops hurting for me after an hour or two.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I would suggest you take some Tylenol now and 3-4 hours from now take some Ibuprofen (motrin).

My last flu shot didn't hurt at all during or after but the one before that was terrible.  It was like I had a hot baseball under the skin of my arm.

The way you get Mono is through saliva.  This means kissing, sharing utensils (ie. knives, forks, etc), even a cough in your direction.  The Kissing disease is a bit misleading, I know.  Personally, just stay away from your friend until he or she has recovered and all is fine.  If you really want to be a daredevil, just take a mask with you when visiting and you will be A-ok.  I hope that helps.
AA11802271	First, congratulations on wanting to be healthy. That is a realistic goal.   With food, you got it, cut out the junk, forgive a screw up, and don't do it again. At your age, getting a calorie count on here isn't safe. Teens need 2000 - 2500 calories, a woman needs 1200 minimum. The range is too big for anyone here to give you a real answer. Don't go too low. Your brain is still developing. That needs protein. ;) Your body is still maturing and needs the fats to make some of what you need later in life. Don't be too strict. Just be healthy about it. Google healthy lifestyles, healthy foods, eating habits, recipes.   Eat small portions of good things. When you are hungry. Not bored, tired, sad, etc. Only hungry. Otherwise, take a walk, lift some stuff, jump rope, jump on your bed. ;) Laugh.   The important thing with exercise is to get the heart rate up for a time period. It's recommended to get 30 minutes at least every other day. At least to start. Go up as you can, and sometimes you won't have time, so you'll ahve to cut short, just try for the minimum. I walk. It was embarrassing at first, but it gets easier, and if you have a friend or dog to walk with, even better. Be sure to break a sweat, but don't get to where you have to pant to breathe. That's asking for too much from yourself too soon. And that's when you hurt yourself and get set back.  Be gentle with you, take it slow, expect to lose 1 to 3 pounds a week. If you lose at that rate, it stays gone. Really gone. I've lost 70 pounds and kept it off for two years and counting. Successfully.   Good luck with changing your life.|`|ecfa6de1352b64f7b40c33dbbd549347aa	You just like, really inspired me. Seriously. I stopped at the gym, and I gained about 15 pounds, so whatever you do, DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT quit excersising. It probably would take around may-june if your lucky!!!!! You are doing GREAT.     :)|`|AA10700407	you're doing great, just keep it up.  eat right and keep up the exercise.  don't worry if you slip once in a while.  how long depends on how well your body responds.  it won't take long, though.|`|9Ev7PdZGaa	hey, i feel your pain.     but i have been working out for about a week now, and i have seem to have lost about 3 pounds.     here are some tips with love from me to you(i love the beatles, hence, with love from me to you, lol just a joke):  - don't keep adding on 5 calories to burn. just keep a steady pace.   - don't eat ANY fat. eat all natural things. (milk, cheese, and bread are ok, just not a lot)  - if you feel like you want to eat for no reason, chew gum! it destracts you.  - do 30 lunges, 30 leg lifts, and 30 weight lifts.     i hope this helps, and i wish you the best on weight loss.|`|hNShT9yhaa	I know how you feel.  I used to be 148 ( 5'6 )  now I'm 130, and what I did is I ran half a mile a day building up to a mile and half slowly. I didn't buy any oreos or chips over this period either.     I also do karate 6X a week, and I lost 18 lbs in 3 months. :)|`|9hTPsTvFaa	you should be eating a minimum of 1400 calories a day, maybe more since your growing. i have the same amount to lose, and i think it will take me somewhere between 8 and 10 months.  also cut out junk food altogether- no sugar, no take out, try and get your calories from fruit and veggies, lean protein and wholegrains.|`|akHYRh5Raa	ROME WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY

632e4ae1417e052b5896511b07931332aa	Well, masturbation is normal.  But if you do it too often, or improperly, or with bad lubrication, you can injure your testes or desensitize your penis.  As long as you ejaculate when you masturbate, your prostate should be OK.  I would limit masturbation to 3 times per week or so if I were you.  Excessive masturbation can leave your body depleted and cause a general decline in health over time.  Have a nice day!|`|1d0261f15969ea337e4a84d4139464b0aa	You appear to have some guilt about masturbation. So far, there have been no confirmed legitimate physical consequences to the practice.

Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva. Any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids, and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain. Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break. Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anusany object used should have a flared or flanged base; otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room. Most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.  According to TCM masturbation can cause lowered Energy level in men as it relieves origin chi(via sperm) from the Tan' Tien (Energy Center located in lower ab) but due to theory partner-sex does not because the partners replinish each others chi. Some say one should not practice martial arts for at least 48 hours after masturbation while others prescribe up to six months, because the loss of Origin Chi does not allow new chi to be created.  A man whose penis has suffered "an invasive procedure, blunt trauma or injury during intercourse" may suffer later in life from Peyronie's disease. There is the rare event of penile fracture which may occur. Phimosis is "a contracted foreskin (that) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back". In these cases, overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic.  Compulsive masturbation can be part of a sexual addiction syndrome.  Lawrence I. Sank (1998) speculated that the habit of masturbating prone (i.e. lying face downward) was responsible for serious sexual problems, including anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as suffered by four men he examined. He coined the term traumatic masturbatory syndrome to describe the effect. As of 2006 there has been no follow-up research and the idea that prone masturbation causes male sexual dysfunction is not familiar or widely-held within the medical community, and thus should not be credited as such until further research.  Some sources, however, continue to give credence to the idea. One sex therapist (Margolies, 1994) has condemned masturbation by rubbing against a pillow or mattress and Lipsith et al (2003) suggest that masturbation could play a part in male psychogenic sexual dysfunction (MPSD), citing Sank as their authority.|`|eb0d3cfc4d0dd0e67b3144534355ed4daa	Masturbation is a basic exercises of your penis, which you help your penile muscle stronger, and bigger.. its like working your abs in a gym or your biceps to create that bulge..    -stay happy
AA11345571	I use this method.     I was on birth control for 6 months and felt horrible. I gained weight, was tired/sad/depressed all the time, my face was always flushed. I finally couldn't stand it anymore and quit. That was in 2004.     You'll read this in your book for sure, but here is just a quick basic overview.     Week 1 - Period  Week 2 - Slight discharge, nothing major  Week 3 - Lots of clear/egg white discharge, this is your fertile time.  Week 4 - Dry sensation    Just avoid week 3 (or if you want to conceive do it then). Of course, every woman is different. The average woman has a 28 day cycle, meaning their fertile time/ovulation is day 14. Easy for them. I'm a bit irregular (sometimes its 26 days, sometimes 32) so I mostly go by my discharge (cervical mucus).     It's been pretty effective for us. We don't use any protection and sometimes he even comes inside me. Like I said we've been doing this since 2004 and no baby!    I am glad to hear another woman doing this. We put our bodies through so much crap with all the drugs we are on. Every time I talk about FAM on here I usually get a bunch of thumbs down. Oh well. Good luck!

T6nmD3X9aa	In Emergency Room care, the most common conditions to be either missed or misdiagnosed are typically:    1) Acute Myocardial Infarction (heart attack)   2) Stroke   3) Pulmonary embolism   4) Meningitis   5) Appendicitis     These conditions lend themselves to misdiagnosis because they can present with uncommon symptoms which are either overlooked or misdiagnosed in emergency care.    In overall (non-emergency) medical care, Davenport (2000) ranks the five most common conditions for misdiagnosis or malpractice as being (in order):    1) Myocardial Infarction   2) Breast cancer   3) Appendicitis   4) Lung cancer   5) Colon cancer       **Hey girl, I also just want to add my professional opinion on this.

yE2vM76naa	You are right, I would do the lasers - but I would do something called Obagi Nu derm first. Its meant to prepare skin for major peels (i.e. the type considered plastic surgery) and/or laser, but it is also a treatment of its own. Its a combination of acids and retin a.    I used it for acne, and its really made a difference in terms of my ice pick scars on my cheeks. I don't brag about products - but I really like this one, and goodness knows, I've tried a bunch.    I tried this one because my mom did it at 60, and her face looked like a babies butt when she was done. {though in between she did look like a shedding lizard - my face wasn't so bad going through it, but I did look like I was covered with white dust for a few weeks}    You can find a doctor from the website  http://www.obagi.com/article/forpatients...
SQxiGhz5aa	There are two types of aged meat.  There is "wet" aged (which is ridiculous) and there is dry aged.  Wet aging uses primals vacuum sealed, thus cutting off airflow, at low temps of about 32 degrees F.  It does little for the taste of meats.  I see not improvement in tenderness or flavor.  It is, in my opinion, a waste of money to purchase wet aged meat.    Dry aged is superior and is all we will consume in our household.    Dry aged meat is professionally dried in proper temperatures with proper humidity levels and airflow for specific amounts of time.     The purpose of dry aging the meats are to dry up the excessive water and break down the tissues to provide meats that are tender and contain a "beefier" flavor.  You are purchasing meat that you will be eating, not water content that will just evaporate as you are cooking it.  Most beef muscle cuts are 70% water content, unless dry aged.    Dry Aging also changes the flavor of the meat.  The "beefy" flavor is more concentrated due to the amount of water loss.       Draw backs to dry aging is that it shortens the shelf  life of the product.  This is why you will not typically see this type of meat in your standard grocery or supermarket.    Old meat just gets old.  Spoilage bacteria build up and rot the meat.
eQ7SiIE5aa	I myself suffer with extreme menstrual cramps every month. I find that AS SOON as I feel like I am getting ready to start, I take two to three IB Profens. Then, this usually doesn't help much for me either. I find that the best relief is sitting in a bath full of hot, hot water. This relaxes the muscles that cause the cramping. You can also buy those disposable heat pads that stick to your skin and give you 8 hours of heat. I also have a homemade heating pack that works wonders. I got an old tube sock and filled it with rice and tied it at the end. Then you just pop it in the microwave for 60 seconds and then place it on your stomach, where the pain is. It really does work wonders. So, to answer your question: when trying to combat bad menstrual cramps, heat is your best friend in the world!|`|oNXygeVZaa	try Midol....that's for menstrual cramps also.

I have a blood disorder that cannot be treated with anything except a good, healthy diet. Try starting small, like eating healthier and then add 15 minute walk (which I use to think about stuff that's been going on), and then slowly start exercising more. Remember, nobody starts off on top, we all have to take it one day at a time. Good luck!|`|7be8f6f9340ed20c51b7dee7242fc6a4aa	what u need is a buddy, someone u can do stuff, someone to encourage u. do no give up. try and try somemore.
vxTcvSYdaa	Unfortunately, it's not possible to lose 25 lbs in 2 months healthily! the most you should lose, naturally, is about 2 lbs per week. If you want a diet/workout plan, my best recommendation is www.sparkpeople.com  You do have to create an account, but they don't send you spam mail or anything. You can chose to have them help you with a diet, or just calculate the calories you're eating.    Calorie wise, just from a guess from me, i'd say about 1400 calories. I'm 5'9 and weigh 160, and when i feel like i need to lose a few pounds, i generally lower my diet from 2500 calories to about 2000....|`|unlQZyfNaa	I'm the same height and if im eating healthy i eat about 1,500 calories and worked out daily. like 100 crunches, 100 lunges, 100 squats, and some jogging- it works|`|VDKVy4A3aa	You should be eating whenever you feel hungry.  Your body has fat cells that can't come back. If you starve yourself, they will die out and the next time you eat a meal, the fat cells will hold on to as much fat as they can. Also, 3500 calories is one pound, so if you try to burn 500 calories a day you can loose 5 lbs a month. If you exercise for 30 min a day for every other day, you can lose 6 or even 8 lbs a month, The most important part is to don't starve yourself or eat less than what your body needs.|`|eA5wTDFKaa	your BMR should be much lower.

Yx5iSat4aa	You probably got ALOT more than herpes.|`|3e35a0513fedfde324327c2ce1f90a3baa	i dont think you have it|`|fk9AvB25aa	Some thing to think about.   1 in 4 adults has genital herpes when you think about it every 4th person you had sex with COULD have had herpes.  Also a lot of people have cold sores (about 4 out of 5 people in the world) if a person with cold sores gave you oral sex they could pass them onto your genitals. So every 2nd person who gave you oral COULD have had cold sores.  It could be a canker sore which is not related to herpes. Canker sores cause some burning and break out in a raised white sore. Oral herpes usually occurs on the out side of the mouth usually around the lips. It comes with some burning and or tingling sensations around where a sore or blister breaks out.  If you want to know for sure then have a doctor check it out.  You can get stds with out being promiscuous, all it takes is for your partner to have one and they may not even know that they have an std.|`|Zas9WXNwaa	A cold sore doesn't usually come on so quickly after exposure to someone with an active outbreak of HSV-1 (herpes that causes cold sores).  What you describe, from the rectangular shape to it coming up the next morning, sounds more like a blister from hard contact (banging your lip against something or biting it).    Typically, it takes anywhere from 12-16 weeks for herpes to develop to the point where it would be obvious in your body or show positive on a blood test by your doctor.     Given the circumstances you describe, I'd highly recommend getting into the doctor or at the very least a Planned Parenthood clinic to have a full screening done for all possible STDs.    Best of luck to you!|`|eKzraNH7aa	cold sore herpes or syphilis and dont drink if you cant carry ur self lik a normal person and try not as many parners 5 would be ok but 20 wow|`|7uB42JzJaa	20 guys huh? wow! a thing in my mouth tha goes away would be the least of my worries!!

Be sure to finish the entire course of medication you are prescribed- even if your signs and symptoms disappear before all the pills or capsules are gone. This is the only way to eradicate the germs causing the infection. If the sinusitis is related to inflammation or allergies, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or pills.     As the sinus infection clears up, the sinus headaches should disappear. In the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers, decongestants and saline nasal spray might help you feel better. Use these products only as directed. It may help to drink plenty of fluids as well.

Yes toothpaste will help make sure it is not the gel type, just the plain white, and do not use colgate because it will burn like hell.  Put it on let it dry and 20 to 30 minutes should be plenty then use a rag and hot rag and wipe the paste off.  If it is red if you put eye drops on it, it will take the redness out so it wont be as noticeable, but it is not permanent.

I also know people who've had success with Weight Watchers -- you have to be patient because the key is in losing weight slowly, but it seems that people learn how to eat properly and end up sticking with the new, healthy habits.    For me, if I want to take off a couple of pounds I cut back on the carbs, cut out alcohol & sugar, and don't eat after 6 pm. It's simple and it works.|`|0d8423108c126f9428ed13430ab8c877aa	i hate mayo|`|0ee4f2f0d632d2585950da9db6ba7d74aa	Nope! sorry.|`|AA12372192	The Mayo Clinic Diet, as it's called, actually has nothing to do with The Mayo Clinic, as you can find out for yourself with some rudimentary research. In fact, it is criticized by them. Having said that, yes, I tried it, and I couldn't stay on it. As for a diet that DID work for me, big time, you might think about trying The Movie Star Diet. I lost over fifty pounds with it, and got down well below what I had set as my original target weight. It takes you through a very direct and simple (if challenging) diet plan step by step.

AA10297143	What you wear truly isn't important, as they will determine based on what you tell them whether acupuncture is right for you or not.  If you will need it and likely get it in the back, then the top is coming off anyway.  Loose clothes is fine, so go with what makes you comfortable.  My first session was about an hour since they also did a heat lamp procedure with me, and burned some sort of incense on my back as well.  That was all followed up with a glass suction cup that was used to "suck" out black blood.  That was the worst part as they actually "ping" you with a hammer that has pins on it.  It stings more than hurts though.  After about 8 visits, the black blood was gone and I was good as new.  I probably wouldn't have gone if I had known all that before hand, but I do recommend it if that is the way you are willing to go.|`|h8l1H4N4aa	Just wear your regular clothes because depending on where you need the treatment, you'll need to remove them.  Some places give you a paper gown, some nothing.  You'll be in a private, curtained-off area, but if you're uncomfortable about having nothing to cover you, see if wearing a loose t-shirt would be possible.    The first session starts with the acup'er asking about your symptoms and maybe filling out a questionnaire (general info, allergies etc.).  The time spent with the actual needles can last anywhere from 20 minutes to maybe an hour (?).    The first couple of times, the needle might pinch a little.  After a few sessions, you probably won't feel it when they're inserted.  If it does hurt too much, say something.  It shouldn't hurt that much and it might indicate the acu'erist isn't doing it right.    One thing I wasn't aware of when I went for my first time, was that it could take 5 or more sessions to actually feel a difference.  It depends on your problem.  It might take less, you just can't be sure until you start.      Not to put ideas in your head, I did feel a little better after 4 sessions, but it didn't completely heal me.  (I have an unusual nerve problem.)  Go with an open mind and relax.
KeeaVzxpaa	I think your doctor is best suited to advise you on what medications to take. An individuals response to any medication is uncertain so more than one is tried. You may be jumping the gun in wanting a shotgun approach to treating your condition. If you take too much medication you may develop new problems caused by them but not recognized as such.   I don't think medications just stop working but what happens is setbacks to the condition. This is the time you may have switched thinking the medication failed. A new medication gives you new hope which brightens the spirit until you get the setback.   I would stick with one SSRI for a long period while enhancing the effect with therapy. If an anti-anxiety medication is needed I would take the smallest dose that allowed me to function and then taper off that as i improved. Let the doctor make the decisions.|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Everyone is different. You should leave the medical advice up to the professionals -- your doctor. You can do research on the web about your medications.
MKRemZkuaa	Well I am not doc Phill but it really sounds like your mom could be part of the problem. Slapping you with her sandles is a little out of line. I think that if you were to take matters into your own hands and call the school and talk to a counsler they would be willing to help you and get you into a program that would be suitable for what education level that you are at. The schools are really cool about that kinda stuff. Once you talk to a counsler they will help you talk to your mom and then get you inrolled into school. The only thing that I would really have for good advise is only go to a school if that is what you really want. Dont go there and get into fights or start ditching. That will only lead you into trouble and your mom might have been right if that is what happens. Good luck to you . I hope it all works out well.

However if you've been exercising and not breathing enough, you dont get enough oxygen and the cells respire a different way that doesnt need oxygen. This produces lactic acid which sits around the muscles causing the cramp. Moving the leg and deep breaths should work
q9i5f0rXaa	Well, to be honest, to achieve what you want, weight training would be more beneficial than martial arts.  Now if there are other reasons motivating to take up a martial art, that's fine, but for the sheer purposes of strength development, weights are going to be superior.  Check out the book, "Starting Strength", by Mark Rippetoe.  I think you'll find what you're looking for.
Dhz4XgQ3aa	I had hypnosis done before twice and it worked for me.

You should go by recommendation. Have you checked Horizon? they are expensive but are meant to sort problems out in 3 sessions.   I think you can pay to be treated by paul in person but i am not sure how much he is. i actually find his voice a bit creepy rather then soothing.   Its worth a go. The other guy must have some phobia of it.

AYgTjteBaa	Hiya,    Just wanted to say, yes it is dangerous. The way to loose weight (unfortunately) is everything in moderation and excercise. - I hate the word moderation.    Aswell, the way to calculate your ideal body weight in kilos is (for women):  45.5 + (2.3 X every inch over 5 foot in height)    In pounds your ideal body weight is 128.2, so i dont think youve any immediate reason to loose weight (hope this encourages you to feel good)!!    I completely understand though if you feel you need to loose it. The best of luck to you!  hannah|`|kuxVB76maa	I have read in Glamour magazine, if you eat less than 1,200 calories a day you will lose muscle instead of fat. Try drinking green tea, dancing to the radio, eat 4 mini meals a day, eating grapefruits and non-fried chicken.|`|AA12208063	You are already a good weight! Don't drop anymore.  Your current weight is exactly where you should be.    A good rule of thumb is to give yourself 100 lbs. for 5 feet, plus 5 additional pounds for every inch over that.  That would mean you should weigh 127.5.    But to answer your question, eating less than 1200 will slow down your metabolism.  Going under 1200 once in the while won't hurt you, but on a daily basis it is not healthy.

He said that the standards were a bit like British hospitals used to be "back in the day" - things were a bit basic, but the actual standards of patient care and cleanliness are much higher than in NHS hospitals. He was very pleased with the way he was treated there, and most of all happy with the final result and hes grateful that he was in the right hands.

AA11609593	No.  As puberty progresses, the amount and distribution of the hair grows.  Also, the coarseness of the hair changes.  It is ok for some hairs to fall out, but not to have a thinning trend.  I have never heard of loss of pubic hair during adolescence.  This is a natural thing to happen as people grow older.  Usually older than 60 or 70 years.|`|AA11518036	Not unless your shaving them off|`|AA10232591	some will fall off or get stuck on your zipper...OUCH !|`|7d82c3d5d76d2968722d0a87a71085ecaa	Not that I know of.

Your pubic hair is usually really coarse and tangled within itself thus the strands that fall out dont fall onto the ground and you can notice them when you take a shower or whenever. Its perfectly natural and you have nothing to worry about. If you notice balding of the area though there may be a deeper problem and should see a doctor, but if there is still ahir in the area you are fine.  Jay

Because if a doctor got it, he should be dealing with it.  If you got it at a drugstore or something, then you'd best see a doctor and get it checked out.|`|KAyVeRezaa	There are various reasons why you got a high reading such as:  At the time you got tested, you were anxious or uncomfortable about something. You had walked a long ways within 20 minutes of getting tested. You have a lot of sodium/salt in your diet. If you consider yourself healthy, this is not a major health risk as of right now because I too had high BP counts when I was younger.    If you haven't done so already, get tested at home when your most relaxed and comfortable to get a more realistic reading. If it's still above 130/90, see what your doctor can do for you.
3JKe5lr8aa	It is never advisable to stop taking your antibiotics early. Antibiotics should be taken for the full course prescribed. Stopping early has the potential to create superbugs in your system. Superbugs are bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. By not completing the regimen prescribed, some bacteria might be left behind that were antibiotic exposed but still alive. They can then multiply and create more bacteria that are now resistant to the antibiotic you were taking. Ever heard of MRSA? MRSA has been in the news in the last year. MRSA is methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is one example of a superbug. VRE, or vancomycin resistant enterococci, is another. Research has indicated that these superbugs were created through both overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Unlike what one of the answerers stated above, do not take antibiotics for viral infections. This is a good example of antibiotic misuse/overuse. Antibiotics are for bacterial infections ONLY.     So, can you stop taking antibiotics early? Yes. You can and you likely wouldn't experience any immediate negative effect. BUT you risk leaving behind bacteria that can create an army of bacteria in your body which can potentially cause problems for you down the road. The next time you get an infection, you risk having the antibiotic not work for you.     Taking Cipro with alcohol has the potential of causing drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, or lightheadedness. Taking flagyl with alcohol should be avoided because flagyl and alcohol together can cause severe nausea, vomiting, cramps, flushing, and headache.     My suggestion would be to complete your antibiotic course, drink some Coke (with no liquor in it!) and enjoy the Superbowl sober. Sounds boring but it is only one day and one Superbowl. There is always next year.     Have fun watching everyone get drunk around you this Sunday and I hope you feel better!|`|WgIZUcYfaa	No. You need to finish. It's the way the antibiotics are meant to work. I would always stop taking them a day or two early and I would be back at the doctors again soon after that. My doctor was always very annoyed. I know it's not the same, but a cancer patient wouldn't stop taking chemo halfway through. You have to finish it or it doesn't work properly. One superbowl wont kill you. I know it will be hard though. Make up for it next year!|`|ENJ0bY48aa	Absolutely not.  Antibiotics only work if you take the entire dose from start to finish.  If you stop taking them early, whatever you had will not be entirely cured and it will come back, typically worse than the first time around.  If you are willing to get sick again and have to go on another full course of antibiotics to have the ability to drink alcohol, knock yourself out.  Just make sure you are making an informed decision.    You're taking Cipro... which is typically given for a UTI... and I'm guessing you don't want another one of those.    Again, antibiotics do NOT work unless the entire course is taken.  All the antibiotics you have taken will be wasted and you will get sick again and have to start from scratch.|`|BOHi9zfcaa	No. It doesn't matter what antibiotics they are. Even if you are feeling better for whatever you are taking them for..there's a reason why your doctors prescribe a set amount of antibiotics for you to take. Even when you feel better, viruses can stay in your body without attacking your body and you need to make sure that every single virus cell is dead. Don't risk it|`|A0SsXJ4zaa	absolutely not|`|m7crO0phaa	No, You need to finish the course otherwise it won't work.   When it is a strict no, it means it will have really bad side effects.

KNeRyHRFaa	Nothing is hurt you just need to put some ice man.  over night your arm should feel better or a little better.  A bicep stretch idk but ik a good workout for them if you have a benching barbell.  Using a shoulder-width grip, grasp a barbell with an underhand grip. Stand up straight with your feet about shoulder width apart. Curl the bar up toward your chest in an arc, keeping your elbows locked in the same place close to your sides. Bring the weight up as high as you can and squeeze the biceps at the peak of the movement for a one-count. Lower the weight slowly, and return to the start position and repeat.

VPlKbDplaa	Duct tape.     Just make sure the area is thoroughly dry before applying and cover to beyond the outer edges of the verucca to be sure it is completely sealed. So do make sure it is fully sealed and if it comes away after bathing then reapply new duct tape straight away after drying thoroughly. She must not unstick the tape from time to time other than what happens naturally from bathing as it will either reduce the effectiveness or increase the necessary duration of treatment.  It needs to be on for at least a week...probably longer depending on how long your daughter has had the verruca and how deep it is. I got rid of a small verucca after only a few days with this treatment.     It is now a medically recognised treatment too:  http://www.jyi.org/volumes/volume7/issue...    No chemicals involved. No extra pain beyond what the verucca causes.

Yoga and gentle stretching exercises can be good, along with brisk walking or having a mad dance in your living room.

I2gMIWDeaa	I'm going to have to say it was when I was in the boys locker room in the 7th grade.  We had to shower after a game, and after I undressed, I had a major erection.  Not wanting every guy in my PE class to see, I quickly dressed and left the locker room without showering.  Two guys saw it and teased me and told everyone else.  I think that was the most embarrassing moment of all (so far).|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

UOZP4Ma5aa	It will be very similar, your boss would need to see you there early, leaving late, putting the extra effort always being one step ahead of the game, you cant really show that you bring in more patients, but try and tell as many people about the practice as possible.

Aavgb2xuaa	Okay, i know this one!  Diet soda is worse than regular soda. I just had this conversation with my Dr. a few months ago. she said that diet soda drinkers think they can eat more because they are drinking "diet" soda. She also said that any soda is bad for you because the carbonation makes you retain water and is very high in calories. I stopped drinking any type of soda and started drinking water and life water...and I lost 30 lbs. in one month. I am dead serious! Oh I started exercising too!

Stops me being a zombie in the worning.|`|HeZorcNWaa	I think any addiction appears 'more addictive' to the addict themselves, at times.    That said, I think caffine is highly addictive because it is socially accepted -even celebrated and encouraged. While alcohol is surrounded by stigma, nightclubs remain an area of controversy and pubs are struggling to stay open, coffee shops are accepted and advertised openly.    Caffine is seen as a far less destructive addiction and a far more managable one. It is also far cheaper and does not esculate in the same manner as say alcohol or drug addiction. Tolerence does not present itself in the same way.    As well, caffine addiction is not inextricably linked with crime, partly because it is legal and does not create any violent intoxication.    Its funny though. I've been physically alcohol dependant and I'm a recovering heroin addict. I could pin heroin four times a day and function, but even then I had a caffine free diet. I'm so sensative to caffine. If I drink strong coffee I get heart palpitations.     Caffine's never been my doc (drug of choice). Too many lows and no real high...but I can understand how people get hung up on it. All I can say is that if you've got to be addicted to something then better it be coffee than booze or gear.    Oh, and Coffee and alcohol is commonly known as 'Irish coffee'. A lot of people drink it. My dad was alcoholic and drank a lot of coffee and he used to begin every day with an 'Irish coffee'. I imagine its quite common...drinks dont usually get their own name unless they're popular.|`|SscKicwEaa	I have to drink coffee every morning to keep me going or I do be like a demon!|`|uUj9yKFiaa	You act like this is a joke.

I have friends who have done it a few times and had a good experience. I did not. There are daily hormone injections had a horrible effect on me. I gained 18 lbs within a month, the the skin on face turned blotchy, they really negatively impacted my moods as well. The surgery to remove them was painful, the doctor wasn't great... So for me overall it wasn't worth it. But like I said... I know of people who have done it and had a good experience.    I would take into consideration that if you are sensitive to hormones that it might not be a good match. Good luck!
YryC6dxUaa	Ear infections can be hard to get rid of, you have to be diligent about take your antibiotics, no skipping or not finishing the entire amount. Even then, It may take a second round of pills to get the infection under control. My son once had to take three prescriptions to get rid of his infection. Surgery is not usually recommended unless you keep getting it back, like 6 times a year. Get lots of rest take all your pills and go get more if you still don't feel good. Ibuprofen for pain.|`|AA10169678	Try a decongestant first.
KAyVeRezaa	The plate you have is pretty damn sturdy. Sounds like you'd have a better chance of breaking your other ankle instead. But you do want to be cautious with your injured ankle so that other areas of your foot don't get injured. Physical therapy may hurt for a short while, but it will help tremendously in the long run. As for the other questions such as you breaking that ankle again, how long you'll be on crutches, walking again, & whether you should get it removed... These are the questions your Doctor and Therapist should know, unless their idiots. Just worry about resting up and keep pressure off that foot.|`|hoDin3UYaa	I would recommend checking out this site.

You could always pick a fight with a large bully.    I know you could try bengay afterward, but I feel like that wouldn't do anything to help lessen the pain of breaking.

jTaW3goeaa	When I broke my collarbone snowboarding, it was more discomfort then pain and it didn't hurt that bad unless I moved it around.  There might be a fracture somewhere in the shoulder area, I don' t think its dislocated because the pain would be pretty bad, much worse then it is for you now, I've seen first hand the amount of pain somebody is in with a dislocated shoulder.    I'd get an X ray, if anything is broken you heal up in a decent amount of time, I was 13 when I broke my collarbone and I only missed a month of boarding, you heal faster when you're younger.

oks9373Waa	1. Limit the amount of soft drinks or alcoholic drinks you use. They are all sugar based, and sugar heats the blood, which in turn heats the body. Cold water and lots of it is a good substitute.  2.Wear loose cotton clothing, preferably light in colour, and if possible wear thongs or sandals.  3. Place a wet towel on the nape of your neck - it works like a warm winter scarf in reverse. Similar for your feet - like a pair of warm socks in reverse.  4.Avoid eating fast foods like hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries etc - they raise the body heat and can do you harm.  5. Do not attempt to do any strenuos exercise, stay inside, close the curtains and keep use of electrical items to a minimum - they all contribute to the heat in a room.  6. Large supermarkets are good places to use free air conditioning - take a folding chair, esky with cold water and sandwiches and a good book, hand held game etc|`|ngpo0iK3aa	Water ballons are always fun|`|5385f45a70dcab7bbb5e7da5f3034aeeaa	If you are closer to the city areas around the daytime, as strange and as much it is a good idea, GO SHOPPING!! more in those major shopping centres where it is air conditioned, if you don't have any money to buy things just window shop, a few cafes also scatter these shopping complex so why not buy some iced chocolates, teas and coffee.    If a nice cold shower is what you are after as well invest in a decent price shower head which makes the water come out in a mist, the air and fine water will cool you all over if only cold water is used, and when in winter it doubles as a steam sauna like shower to take away those aces and pains.|`|20e7e542ef7453313d738e0f1887a5b2aa	Put your head in a bucket of ice !!|`|OEv8gjPxaa	i live in melbourne and its sooo hot today ive got the fan right in front of me ive got the air con on but that doesnt seem to be doing anything, its one of those older air cons that are like vents in the ceiling and of course im renting so i cant do anything about that, my poor 11month old son was so hot i sent him to my mums house she's got better air conditioning and as for me i think i'll go sit in the bath with ice cold water. you can always go down to the beach for a swim by try and stay out of the sun as much as you can, and like some other people said go to the shopping centres there usually cool in there good luck in this heat|`|tP40FRz5aa	don't wear a bra when your able to!  i live in queensland and it's bloody hot here, it's the only way to minimize body heat :P|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	I live in the refridgerator.|`|WzkXYvwVaa	I live in the Perth Hills so it gets very hot during the summer.  I don't have any air conditioning.  I find that if you open up all the windows and doors early this can make a difference and then when the sun gets up close everything and shut blinds and curtains etc.  When the sun goes down open up everything again. I've got a pool so I can cool off by nipping in and out but if you don't have a pool, have a cool shower and keep a couple of buckets in the shower to collect water (for plants), you could even buy a small kiddies pool to sit in and tip water over yourself (again recycle the water for plants).  Make sure pet's water is checked regularly as it can heat up during the day and give them a rub down with a wet towel occasionally.  Good luck!|`|CpbofDPhaa	Keep the window curtains closed from early morning, if you have ceiling fans keep them on low to move the air around.  Put your feet in a bucket of water.

So does spending time at an air conditioned shopping centre (without the wallet) as long as  there is not a power cut there too.  In the end I decided the best way to deal with the hot Adelaide summer was to move to Tasmania.  Now that worked.|`|g7Dfos1laa	Portable fans r always good u can get little ones for ur work desk.

Close down shutters and curtains very early in the morning.  2. Use a cooler or make one temporarily with a fan; wet a small towel,sweege it and place it in front of a fan, put the fan on. Stay close to the fan at most times.  3. Drink plenty of fluids and cold drinks.  4. Avoid alcohol or caffeines.  5. Sprinkle the resting area and bed with a little water, let it evaporate for evaporation causes a cooling effect.  6. Put off electrical gadgets that give out heat.  7. Take a cold shower,  8. Eat plenty of water borne fruits like mellons.  9. Avoid chewing gum, that will make you more thirsty.  10. Keep indoors most of the time.  11. Wet your body from time to time and do not wipe off.  12. Wear as minimal clothes on as possible.  13. Wear cotton clothes if possible.  14. Wear short clothes if possible.  15.

But when drinking all that water you must remember to keep your salt intake up, this does two things: encourages you to drink more and replenishes the salt you have lost thru sweating. vegemite sandwiches are the go (and how dare they even suggest banning it!)

This is the link I bought mine from:    http://www.brightlife.com.au/store/solar...    Also I only wear sleeveless clothing, especially thin cotton singlets and baggy shorts. We always have a constant supply of cold drinks in the fridge.     Regularly splashing my face with water and placing wet towels over my body at night or when having a rest.      Keeping still and eating cool foods such as yoghurt's, fruit, and juice all help.     Also spraying the outside of your house/flat and yard with water make a difference.    Always ensure your pets have ice water. My pets have a ceramic bowl inside and outside. It keeps the water cooler for longer. Give your pets a spray with water on their body sometimes as this rehydrates their bones.    A portable evaporative air cooler for around $200 is great if you can afford it. You can add ice to them if you want and they last a long time.    Finally if you can buy an air conditioner DON'T get one from online discount stores. Chances are if you need a replacement part or service you'll NEVER get it.   "Good Guys" are the cheapest and best to buy from. We learnt this after paying maximum $$$.  The cost of fitting an air conditioner is the most expensive part. Ask your retailer beforehand if they can reccomend someone / best to get some quotes.    At least try to get a small fan. Even pedestal fans are quite cheap at around $30.

Dunk hands and wrists in cold water (and feet) - all those veins at the inside wrist in the cold water help with heat transference and you will cool down.  I would suggest letting cold water run over your wrists and feet but with the water shortages its not a great idea.  3.  Keep cold (not icy) water in the fridge and sip at it constantly.  4.  Freeze your hot/cold packs and use them on your face or any other 'veiny' area.  5.  Get a normal light bedsheet and soak it in water.  Hang it at the back doorway so that it covers the entire doorway, especially if a light breeze is coming from that direction and its out direct sunlight.  Use it across open windows, anywhere there may be a breeze coming from.  For small babies, hang the wet sheet across the rails of the cot and direct a fan onto the cot.  6.  Keep the house as closed up as possible and use heavy curtains over the windows if the sun is on them.  7.  Dress as lightly as possible.  Try to wear only light cottons without waistbands - if your only light cotton is your nightie, stay in it all day.  You are actually cooler in a light cotton than if you are naked.  Try to avoid synthetics totally.  8.  Turn off any electrical equipment (computer, TV) and only use the lights if its absolutely essential.  9.  No cooking today - live on salads and sandwiches  10.  Fill the bathtub with cool water and wallow for a while with a book  11. Drink water - if you can't stand just plain water, squirt a little lemon juice into it.  I keep a 2 litre container in the fridge at all times and drop about half a lemon sliced up into it whenever I need to fill it up. If you have lemon squeeze (concentrated lemon juice) just squirt enough in to make it just a hint of lemon.  You aren't looking at a lemon drink, you are looking at making plain water more palatable.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	How hot is the weather?!  School got CANCELLED because of how hot it is!  And YES I live in Victoria.     Anyway, we don't have airconditioning upstairs,  only in the family room and bottom rooms.     My best tip is to keep the rooms nice and dark and buy some fans to have running. I've got a fan in my room to cool me down - even if he doesn't do as good as job as air conditioning!     Well hope goes well.|`|8ReUKb7Baa	I went out with a normal Square shape neckline top and was  shopping and out & about, when i went home i realised i had  burned .   My son was quite wind burned from fishing  and  the back of his neck very sore from no protection.and ears too..even though he had a cap on...people forget areas where like the neck can  be exposed and you do severe sun damage.    My case i was shopping and out during the hottest part of the day, he  was using sun protection but areas that are exposed like that for  long periods like fishing need to really have better cover, like the  wide brim hats.    I DON'T know how we did it years ago when i was a child, but recall  that we went to the beach a lot.  My mum & dad would get up early  and we would all help packing the car with everything and spend the  entire day at the beach.  Even on extreme weather on week-days we  would just head to the beach.   At night if it was real bad, dad would  leave the screen door locked and put a single mattress to sleep on  because he said he couldn't sleep otherwise and had to work the next  day...so this was his solution.|`|rgOBHB5uaa	go swimming|`|LM5X30C7aa	I've seen squirty bottles with fans attached, run off a battery from cheap shops.  Also if u have ceiling fans, keep a spray bottle of water handy and give your self a spray with fan going, helps you get 2 sleep when it's hot.|`|cxrMqCzRaa	The last place I lived in didn't have a/c.... I used to deal with it by dampening a teatowel and putting it in the freezer for half hour or so and wrapping it around my neck.  We used to also get comfy on the couch using a pedistal fan (you can pick these up for about $15 from bunnings ect..) and a hair spray bottle filled with water! just spritz it infront of the fan and the water drops feel like heaven! =)   I live in sarongswhile Im home in summer they are the closest thing to being naked! haha!|`|1nvCPsR6aa	Drink plenty of water.

I have air con at home... but before we did it was a case of wearing light clothing.. and having cool bubble baths ( would leave the water in and jump in and out ( as not to waste water ) ..    using fans and perhaps hanging a damp towell (NB NOT DRIPPING WET)over a fan to make a cool breeze....      At work .. we are in a hot warehouse... and there are blowers that attempt to keep the air moving .. BUT in vain attempts to keep cool.. I have spray bottles filled with water and I absolutely drench myself. I also have a neck tie which is soaked in water and refridgerated and you wear in to help keep cool ( these are available in Rebel Sports and Anaconda and the such stores have these)    it is also better to KEEP moving than sit still and whine about the heat.. but you must be able to recognise the need to stop if overheating|`|TlHwwnmBaa	"cope"?

Its no hotter than any other summer for the past 60 years or more.  It happens every summer. My lounge room of an afternoon gets to 46 degrees becaue the sun hits it full on. With an air con, cheap portable it comes down to 37 around 8pm.  Just bought it today. stay out of the sun, and drink ice water. I work outside, and find cold water does wonders.  Failing that buy yourself a few bags of frozen peas and cover yourself in the bags.|`|2a223389f47914045e3f7fae19d0944baa	Sit under a  tree and suck ice cubes|`|rCSQ4g8saa	cold water. and a fan!|`|VDKVy4A3aa	Try to always be hydrated and it's usually cooler in the basement  Try to shade out all the sun from the windows and keep the air flowing with a fan and keeping doors open.|`|9b6dcd6a249084e0ac0fa40d1f6a5990aa	These are some ideas my friends had about keeping cool when you have no air-conditioning. I've tried some of them and they work for me so I hope they work for you too.     1. buy some cheap foil and stick some sheets on the windows that let the most sun in but keep in mind to stick the sliver side facing outwards.     2. sit in a bath of cold water. For work grab a spray bottle and fill it with ice cubes and water. Constantly use it during the day as a spritz bottle.        3. Try to take a warm shower  as it takes longer for you to dry therefore you will remain cooler for longer.     4. Drink some water without any additives such as cordial.     5. Sit as low as possible and away from windows.     Hope this all helps. Keep cool.|`|cde1eb5b81886b77d7a46193168a1ce2aa	First, if you can afford it, buy a small portable air-con (which I think you can get for less than $200.  If not, drink plenty of water, this will not only keep you hydrated, but will also cool down your body temperature which is just as crucial.   Cut out all hot foods, stick to salads etc.  Have a cool shower regularly, even a one-two minute cold shower will do wonders.  Keep all lights off where possible, and if you cant get a cheap air-con, hang wet towels in front of your fan (s) to at least circulate some cool air.  During the day, if your work doesn't have air-con, it will be tough, but same rules apply. If there is no shower at work, at least wet your hair for some relief.  Finally, if you live in an area where it regularly gets hot, I would advise saving up to buy an air-con, it will be the best investment you've ever made (if you're in rented accommodation, put the pressure on the landlord to do this, offer say an extra $5-10 per week in rent if they do)|`|8062aa648ee5f565e19730ddeaff579daa	I wet a Cotton T-Shirt with cold water and put it on.

Works wonders.|`|2jp6Lyr3aa	Open all your windows and doors an hour before dawn to let in the cool air.      Close everything up at about 8 or 9 am when the day starts to heat up.    Open everything up again after the heat of the day has passed.    Alternatively, go to New Zealand for the summer...|`|sTCn0FqOaa	Buy a big can of HTFU and drink it!  But seriously, wear loose light cotton clothing, no synthetics, go commando or whear loose cotton boxers, drink lots of water, your body needs 4 litres a day, I have a 2 litre bottle and I refill it at lunch time, do an hours excercise in the morning, it will boot your metabolism and get all your body functions working, sweat, if you stop sweating get to hospital, your stroking. Make hessian curtains for the windows and doors on the windward side and keep them moist open your doors and windows to take advantage of any breeze as it passes through the wet hessian it will cool.  Dont keep going in and out of places that are airconditioned, this will just reduce your natural acclimatiseation.  If you can have a siesta between 12 and 2.  There was no air conditioning when I was a kid. I was about 15 when evaporators came out and all they are is an electric powered hessian curtain.|`|KN7jKcPBaa	Well I have no airconditioning in my bedroom, I just open my window at about 6pm, then leave it until I go to bed. My room is like warm, but I cope because I was born in summer, but I don't know if that has anything to do with it. According to a wizard game I'm playing, I'm a fire type. Also drink a glass of water before breakfast, the dizzyness goes away. Also sometimes I go out of my room to the lounge room which has airconditioning. My parents are old-fashioned so we have the older air conditioners.|`|RC1Y5Y5iaa	Most heat gets into the house through glass. Best solution is awnings or shade cloth on the outside so the sun doesn't hit the glass. Next best is heavy, thermal backed curtains on the inside. If you don't have thick curtains and you want a quick fix hang a blanket or doona inside the windows the sun hits for insulation.    Any window or door not in direct sun, if it's getting a breeze open it and hang a wet sheet there to cool the air that is coming in, keep wetting it.    Veg out while it's hottest, it's not the time to be running around. If you have a fan sit in front of it and spritz yourself from a spray bottle or keep wiping yourself down with a damp cloth. Minimal clothing and no synthetics.    Avoid sugary drinks, they'll dehydrate you, stick to plain water and lots of it.|`|fXmUiAYPaa	when i used to live there, i didnt have airconditioning. we used to set up a pool in the backyard under big old gum trees and just soak! or when the baby was only 4 lb and very new and the hottest summer on record for sa at the time, iused to wet nappies or towels and hang in front of the fan to make the room a lot cooler for her. not only did the nappy cut the strength of the fn on her little body but it provided the moisture for cooling!   another good idea is to wet a chux wipe and tie loosely around your neck.   otherwise keep the fans going when inside or even in the shade outside.|`|oXl8zVZmaa	I have found that if you get 2 face washers or the wrist bands that the tennis players use and soak them in iced water and put them on your wrists it will cool your blood down when in contact the veins on your wrist as the wrist bands cools down keep them wet. I hope this helps|`|7qE4wC13aa	It is simple. If you live in a new brick house or a proper built house and you know tomorrow is gonna be hot. Then what you need to do overnight is to sleep with windows open or partially open. Make sure your screen windows are properly working or your fence is high enough to stop intruders or burglars. Then wake up very early next morning and close/shut all windows properly. The idea is to captured in the overnight cool air and prevent the day hot air coming in.This will keep you cool during peak hours of heat approximately 3-4 hours. After the heat subdued, open the windows and sit outside. Hopefully, the afternoon wind is now blowing and enjoy the evening breeze.|`|91sBjTtAaa	you dont|`|Uo82maXAaa	either a wet cloth ( sheet or pillow case would do ) put it up to an electric fan and it creates cool air try it its worth a shot or go to the shops , lib, movies any where with air con , or just keep hydrated and put up with it , This is Aus after all i dont kno y ever1 is complaining this is only 5-8 degrees hotter than this time of year in the past|`|AoVYQKGjaa	im in western australia and even though we have air con in my house when we arent home we clothes the blinds in our house to make it all dark so the heat wont get in and it keeps the house so coool its really good or just buy a cheap fan and use that it does fine or try getting air con installed. ours got installed in like one or two days.  hope this helps.  oh and keep hydrated!|`|UV8NtlOKaa	Best way to cope wid summer heat is to drink butter milk.

RhXugkTtaa	my friend has anemia. u get cold all the time and ur allways tired...also u hav 2 take iroin pills but dats all i kno|`|TPpTAKAdaa	Anemia may contribute to impaired thinking among older adults, according to a new study.  Anemia - a low level of hemoglobin, the pigment that carries oxygen around the body - can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue. Now researchers at Johns Hopkins University reveal that it can lead to impaired thinking as well.     They gave tests to evaluate so called executive function - a type of thinking that influences problem solving, planning and following up - to 364 women in their seventies. Around one in ten had anemia. Fifteen per cent of those with the worst scores were anemic, compared to just three per cent of those with top scores. A loss of executive function can lead to a corresponding decline in self-sufficiency. It may be that anemia diminishes the supply of blood to the brain, or that fatigue leads to a loss of physical fitness, which has a knock-on effect. Of course, this study does not actually prove that anemia causes loss of executive function - or that its treatment will restore it. But these questions are worth further exploration.

AA11955868	I would probably go in to ask if you're still feeling severe pain while eating. You should be eating reasonable solid food just a couple days afterward. (like, literally 2). If you're slow to heal, maybe 4. Needle like pain, is probably not a good sign. But have you been taking the meds they gave you? I imagine some pain is still going to happen, and I 'remember' being on a lot of drugs the first day.    It'd probably just be easiest to set up an appointment, or maybe just call and ask.|`|87CTeVzxaa	I used to be a dental assistant and Ive had a dry socket to!  My ear and jaw hurt like heck.

KeeaVzxpaa	You obviously need a second or third opinion. It does not matter how many doctors say there is nothing wrong if there is. Your symptoms do not indicate you are fine. The doctors you have seen have not uncovered the cause so you will have to insist on a better doctor as your health is everything.|`|JV52VEpKaa	Ask your regular doctor for a referral to a neurologist, and ask for a CT scan if the MRI didn't show anything. CT scan will pick up things that MRIs won't and vice versa.    Your symptoms are pretty generic for all sorts of neurological problems, it is best to see a specialist. If you have already seen one (can't tell from your question) ask for a referral to another one. If money is an issue it might be looking up which universities are doing neurological research and getting referred to a professor of neurology associated with them, you might get a better deal.
Yx5iSat4aa	It won't.|`|5INu2kzdaa	after you took the antibiotic they should have told you to not have sex for 7 days....i mean no sex at all. they do that to make sure it's working and they should have had your partner get treated as well anyone you have slept with in the last 60 days. because if you got treated and you partner didn't and they have it you will just be passing it back and forth and that defeats the purpose of treatment

5jf5tcMnaa	There is no term in Dentistry called an "underbite".  This is a term used by non-dental people.  What you have is called a Class III Malocclusion.  Most likely you need your lower jaw split and moved back. This is called a Mandibular Setback. You may also need your upper jaw brought forward.   This is known as Orthognathic Surgery.  Keeping your jaws in this position for a long time could cause an irrepairable change in your jaw joints as well as some abnormal tooth wear.   You need to consult with an Orthodontist and an Oral Surgeon.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	This is called an "underbite", you should google that. Usualy they put in a device to expand the upper part of your mouth and then do braces or they do jaw surgery.

I had a serious one - and it took six years of extensive brace work, and three operations (two minor, one major -14 hours) operation to correct the problem. Mind you, my problem was more extensive then most - with my bottom teeth 1.5cm in front of my upper.    If its not causing you any trouble with teeth grinding or chewing, I would leave your jaw as it is. The operations are no joke - and neither is spending 12 - 15 weeks on a liquid diet...    The operation consists of them breaking both your upper and lower jaw in two places. Your lower jaw has bone removed, and metal plates are used to hold it in place whilst it heals (these plates are never removed - so its fun going through secuirty scanners)    Your upper jaw is also broken, and depending on the amount of space it has to move - they either move and plate into position - or do it gradually using distractors - where your jaw is moved forward bit by bit, over the course of a week or two (a very bizzare feeling)    Sometimes, if the operation doesn't go quiet to plan (the break is in the wrong place, isn't clean - etc, etc) they may have to wire your jaw together for the duration of the treatment - but nowadays, this is a very rare occurance.|`|iYPwLxr3aa	you got an under bite,my friend had an "over"bite ......she got braces for a couple months and her teeth were normal after ward...........she said braces are actually extremely comfortable
Yx5iSat4aa	Yes.|`|fk9AvB25aa	You can get cold sores which can be caused by the oral herpes virus.

AA11311516	there are two ways to test, skin test and blood test.    Skin test is painless until you have an allergic reaction to something. They do a scratch (no pain) then apply the allergen and if you are allergic you will have a red bump that will itch. They apply the allergen and wait 20 minutes to see if you have a reaction. Mine took about 3 hours all together.    Blood test is just that, they draw your blood and send it to the lab.    Email me if you have any other questions!|`|K3EJTYYDaa	Starfish is right that is the way Doctors do it.
8ae38a2ac6a77dd4a25ba0e15d91e256aa	it's ALL genetics. you have an ephyseal plate located in your femur bones. as your bones produce new cells, it fills in the plate and your femur becomes longer, making you taller. once the plate completely hardens, you are done growing taller. (you can always expand outward of course). if i'm not mistaken, your dentist can tell if you have reached your maximum height. there is a surgery for SEVERE debilitating cases, in which they break the plate, and with internal screws gradually seperate the plate, and due to the injury, new cells grow in. this is extremely painful, and is a lengthy process taking anywhere from months to a few years. most orthopedic surgeons will not perform this operation in the US. given your age, you probably won't get much taller.|`|nBMVi9t8aa	EAT YOUR VEGTABLES!THAT IS HOW MY BIG BROTHER IS TALL!HE IS 6 FOOT 1 HE IS 18 AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM EMAIL ME|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	It's all genes.

AA12348388	about 1 in 5 women have group B streptococci (aka Strep Agalactiae) colonized in the vagina so its quite common. it will not cause any problems to you, it is just growing there like any other normal bacteria of the genital tract.    the concerning problem is that when you have are about to deliver a baby - the baby is at risk of getting infected from it while he or she passes through the birth canal (it does not infect the baby while the baby is still in the birth sac). even so the risk of babies developing this infection is about 1%    however with treatment of antibiotics at the onset of labour - the risk is reduced to nearly 0%    so dont worry! you'll be fine
HWtG9dkzaa	Well, all anaesthetics carry a very small risk, no matter your weight, etc - but if your doctor isn't concerned about it, you shouldn't worry about it either.|`|4b1e6590878cc0511f0141d75afbee83aa	You should discuss  this with you doctor  and anaesthetist

exMPHWKHaa	Nothing happens when a pill expires really its just a way for the pharmaceutical company's to make more money. Those pills will last awhile. Sometimes though with certain pills they can lose their potency after awhile or turn into something dangerous. But in this short amount of time nothing happened to them.
jmke0hrmaa	Yes, it's most likely because you are flat footed that you are having this issue. You can get insoles which help to support your feet while you are running, I don't mean the ones tyou buy at the supermarket, I mean go to a doctor and get fitted for some specifically for you.     Also, try these exercises:    Exercises to help the arch    There are a number of exercises that have been suggested as helping "fallen arches", but the evidence is that they do not help (that does not mean they should not be done as many exercises can help some people).    Going to get a bit technical here to explain this.    * some "experts" recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles in the arch to help "fallen arches".    * these muscles generally run from the heel bone to the bases of the toes, so theoretically they could raise the arch    * research studies that have used needles in these muscles to see how they function when walking show that they do not start contracting until just about the time that the heel comes off the ground    * making these muscles stronger with exercises is not going to do a lot of good, if the arches have "fallen" while the heel is still on the ground (which most are)    * also the muscles are small and during propulsion (push off), a very large amount of force goes through the foot - can having them stronger really resist those forces?        I used to have issues, but I found that buying running shoes every 4 months helps......I don't know if you are in a position to do the same, but that may work for you as well.|`|YkseyT7zaa	The tendons that run thru that area are strained. i get those too|`|AA11612269	better get some arch supports. before you have  real problems|`|rNdun1V7aa	when I run this happens to me too, I do ice a little bit...not much seems to help. I think it just stretches because your using so many muscles in your foot.|`|9hSSocD0aa	You have like some problem.  my grandpa has that and he  had to stay home from work  for like 2weeks.  -XD|`|AA11913364	If you have flat feet or any other problems a podiatrist can help.  They are specially trained to work with the problems of the feet.  Insert can help and a podiatrist can have them special make so that they fit your correctly and help the problem that you have.  Good luck|`|BOHi9zfcaa	I have that same problem..except it's only on one foot. I suspect it's because of flat foot and my doctor just told me to get orthopedics but so far I've been able to live with it and I run nearly every day|`|AA11298074	you prob need to see a foot doctor and get either special running shoes or insets|`|Rnaub4P6aa	yes ice it and do you drink any water while running?!|`|s1fy0IKfaa	idk maybe you need new shoes. ones with better arch support. or a softer arch. yea. i would ice it until you find out why its hurting exactly.|`|lsTTqNHnaa	Plantar fasciaitis (spelling).  Rest, try new shoes, or see an orthopedic doctor for inserts.|`|MBPR4PX5aa	see a ped. I had that same problem and it kept getting worse turned out I had an extra bone and I had to have surgery|`|PQqHB2ZHaa	Maybe you need to get a new pair of running shoes.  I think you should probably apply heat if they are sore...like a heating pad or hot water bottle.  Also you could try a medicated rub for sore muscles.  But to prevent it in the future a good pair of running shoes...and some dr scholls inserts should do the trick|`|Tpa7wcQXaa	Your flat feet IS the reason why.  I have flat feet and I had this problem before I bought newblanace shoes that have special orthopedic inserts built in.  My calfs would also start to burn.  You'll notice that once you get inserts you can run a lot longer because there is no more pain.  I haven't worn newbalance shoes since I was little though, you can go to a podiestrist and they will be able to recommend you will special inserts that no one can see in your shoes.|`|t9rulFv4aa	You most likely have a high arch.   You can buy a simple inset for your shoes that will support your arch, and that should stop the pain.

It's not like it all happens within half a second. You have a few seconds to do something about it.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	Try the stop - go method. Masturbate as usual, and just before you reach orgasm, stop for a minute or so, then start again. Repeat this as many times as you an stand. this will teach you to control your ejaculation, and you should be able to go for as long as you like.  If you feel you have gone too far, place your thumb on top of your penis, and forefinger below, just under the head, and squeeze hard until the desire to ejaculate goes away.  Hope this helps|`|5yUIguSsaa	think of your mom.|`|EHrysQcCaa	for instant results you can spray a bit of chloraseptic on the head of your member.

It should be clear in a week, but usually your doctor wants to see you back in about 30 days to be sure it's completely cleared up.

You don't want to reinfect before the azithromycin has a chance to really clear it up.    Best of luck!|`|RIlEJlJwaa	I was given 4 x 500mg tablets last thursday afternoon at the std clinic in a hospital and i was told it would clear in 1 week on the safe side.  i find hospital clinics are much better that doctors surgerys
5PIgZ7tFaa	Being sensitive is not a bad thing - quite the opposite. It is not something people would benefit from changing. What you can change is your REACTION to hurtful things.    You don't give a lot of information, but if you are sensitive to things people say to you, you need to let it roll off like water on a duck's back. Some people say mean things and you need to accept that some people can be jerks. If I'm off base here, maybe you can re-post and give a little more detail in what your oversensitivity really means.|`|iybezfi6aa	Definitely. The vast majority of people don't care if they hurt you or not. In fact, if you are sensitive, it is like you have a "Kick Me" sign on your back.  Care what YOU think and screw everybody else. This takes practice. You can still be a nice person. In fact, it will make you a more mature compassionate person.|`|ef7e4d26174134848be66e4501e42d90aa	I changed to normal(just barley) from being very very sensitive. It's possible.|`|GSn3m2sAaa	of course it is possible, but it will definately take a concious effort in everything you do. instead of letting the little things get to you, when you notice them doing just that, just drop it, let it go, it'll be hard at first but I think you'll find that it's worth it in the long run
oy7mNHJNaa	It doesn't hurt much upon removal.  Some women say it feels like one menstrual cramp but its over very quickly.

Tjbu6wIlaa	You should eat MUCH LESS FOOD, and DEFINITELY MUCH LESS FAT.  You should also do some long distance running/quick jogging (not walking).    You should work at at least 60% of your maximum heart rate  To give you a rough idea of how to do that, here is an example ..  220- Your age = Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)  (MHR) / 100 then x 60 = 60%  After the exercise session, take your heart rate and should at least reach it but not more than 80%    If you have a running machine (or whatever it is called), it will be very useful .. but believe me it will be boring|`|vyOtJyqkaa	don't eat everything and take a ton of laxitaves.

There are structures on the bottom of the foot such as nerves and tendons/ligaments http://www.newenglandpodiatry.com/assets... http://www.umm.edu/graphics/images/en/19... that can cause pain like you describe.      Plantar fasciitis http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/plantar... usually occurs on the arch (bottom) of the foot.

PLu40QgBaa	Stress plays a big part on when you get your period. But you really need to get checked out. The HPV virus can cause spotting and late periods but so can stress.

But I was told for the first few days soothing liquids...not warm.  Cold.  Smoothies, milkshakes, yogurt, but make sure with no chunks, or seeds or anything that can get stuck in the hole.  It has been 4 days for me and I am still worried about dry socket.  Plenty of rinses with warm salt water 24 hours after the extraction.  after eating.  Today if I were you just rinse with regular plain water after drinking/eating other stuff just so the holes keep clean.    Hope this helps - those 3 things are about the only thing I have stuck to until it is healed over completely. and lots of water|`|HWtG9dkzaa	The best thing you should drink is nothing with sugar in it. Try something cool, like milk. You don't want anything with citrius in it. Also, wash your mouth out with salty water - as this keeps the wound site clean, and helps the healing process.    You may be feeling ill, because you want to eat something, and the medicine may be something you should only take whilst eat.     I do strongly suggest you eat something - even if its just some toast with a little butter on it.

AA11250219	In the morning, when you haven't eaten, you are likely to be at your lowest weight of the day. You weight throughout the day will be affected not only by what you eat but what you drink. Even just drinking water will make you (temporarily) heavier. To assess how a diet is going, you need to weigh yourself at the same time of day each day, wearing approximately the same amount of clothing.

And you probably drank water too.  That adds weight that works off during the day and evening.    Diets won't take weight off that fast.  Don't frustrate yourself by weighing once or twice a day.  The experts say weigh once a week, at the same time of day wearing the same thing (like nothing or the same robe).  That gives your body some time to lose weight.     Also, the first week or two it is possible to gain, even with a good diet and exercise.  This could be because you are gaining muscle mass (which weighs more than fat).      Don't get discouraged.  It will work for you.|`|9266a5b9c0d98df525da7e45cfbcb835aa	you have to watch your carbs when you diet and if you drink in excess of water that will put weight on temp. weigh yourself one day and dont get back on the scale for 1 month and see the results and make sure the scale is accurate and set right at zero when you weigh yourself|`|e0918b0470a198f0ebfb758f27557839aa	everybody  gains weight during the day  You need to only  weigh yourself once a week and at the same time each week|`|d82fcd44a7e95a000024e72ae8bbffdbaa	Weight flucuates throughout the day. Weigh yourself in the morning after you pee and poo. It takes a long time to lose weight. I started 4 weeks ago and have only lost 10lbs. Just remember each pound of fat equals 3000 calories you need to burn somehow. So if you ear 500 less calories a day, you will lose a little over a pound a week depending on your metabolism. Also eat every 3 hours, and a meal the size of your hand.|`|AA11996597	Everyone weights more at the end of the day than they do at the begining... Diets take time, you cant eat well for one day and expect to lose weight... Dieting has to be a continious thing... Also, what is really good? To have a successful diet, you need to have a balanced diet...  To make sure you are eating a balanced diet you should check out the Canadian food pyramid (I dont know what the american one is called)... But each day you should eat more veggies than anything else, 2nd most fruit, then I believe it is dairy and meat...  Some really healthy diet foods include: veggie soup, fish, soy products, berries, lettus/spinach (leafy green veggies), yogurt, apples, almonds (no more than 23 per day) and eggs (one a day)... Peppers are also great for weight loss because they speed up your motabolism, spicy food speeds up your motabolism too... Rather than eating 3 huge meals a day, eat several small ones, that will also speed up your motabolism...   Also, the more water you drink, the more weight you will lose, dont drink anything except water!    Good Luck!|`|11c20491c109eb34f1b3c2c9629b3c58aa	well the whole 4 lbs more thigng could just be where you put the scale.but you cant exspect a hug change after one day tack you time and keep at it|`|AA10863292	People almost always weigh more at night, and less in the morning.  If you insist on weighing yourself daily, make sure you have the same meal time routine and always weigh yourself at the same time.  Otherwise,  I would say weekly will be more accurate.  If you weigh yourself everyday, it is sure to fluctuate and you will just get frustrated.|`|3d4268aaaf884f31d03a640568d3f984aa	okay people weigh different at different parts of the day.  early morning wieght is best.  I have just broke the 150 mark by one pound but at the end of the day I could be about 2 lbs over.  Drink plenty of water and watch your calories, exercise 3 times a week or better and weigh once /day.  weight also changes by several lbs depending on time of the month.|`|06ea99bac4b1209300b1d132cc5646dbaa	Every body's weight fluctuates from day to day. It is unhealthy to weigh yourself every day. Its best to weigh yourself once a week on the same day, first thing in the morning after you have been to the bathroom. The reason you probably put on a little extra weight at the end of the day is because you're body hasn't had time to digest the food that you have eaten yet. Don't get disheartened just keep at it and you will see results. Remember to loose weight you have to burn more calories a day than you take in so exercise plays a major role as well.

You'll get fat and sick, and eventually die from heart problems if not cancer too.    If you want lean muscle and be strong and healthy, eat protein rich foods, low in fats (you need some fats for vitamin processing), low in sugars, eat plenty of good carbs (like in whole wheat breads and whole wheat pastas), omega-fatty acids like in fish, and get yourself a good workout routine, and stick to it.

Les vertiges priphriques sont provoqus par une atteinte de l'oreille interne (sige du vestibule et de la cochle) ou du nerf vestibulaire (nerf s'unissant au nerf cochlaire pour former le nerf auditif). Les vertiges centraux tmoignent d'une atteinte des centres vestibulaires  l'intrieur de l'encphale.     - Les vertiges priphriques dus  une atteinte de l'oreille internecomprennent la maladie de Menire, de cause inconnue, qui affecte simultanment le vestibule et la cochle. Le vertige paroxystique bnin de position, caractris par sa brivet, dclench par un brusque mouvement de rotation de la tte, se range galement parmi les vertiges priphriques. Une labyrinthite (inflammation du labyrinthe) par propagation d'une infection de l'oreille moyenne (otite aigu? ou chronique), certaines intoxications mdicamenteuses (par les aminosides), un traumatisme cranien peuvent tre aussi responsables de vertiges priphriques.     - Les vertiges priphriques par atteinte du nerf vestibulaire sont dus  un neurinome de l'acoustique (tumeur bnigne de la 8e paire de nerfs craniens) ou  une nvrite vestibulaire (destruction brutale, d'origine probablement virale, du nerf vestibulaire).     - Les vertiges centraux sont d'origine vasculaire (accident vasculaire crbral), tumorale, traumatique, infectieuse ou toxique.|`|091895af7cc92d3d3f570e36ec9e3ffbaa	seul le medecin pourra faire un diagnostic mais les vertiges peuvent etre la causes de beaucoup de choses la fatigue le stress une alimentation pas equilibre ou peu importante un pbl cardiaque et j en passe|`|9fe3ecd9c26f6e77cf7a2cab444b76beaa	l'oreille interne ...allez voire un ORL|`|jc1G3VEuaa	Mnopause, problme d'oreille.

The third week, start jogging, walking, until you can build up to steady jog for at least an hour. Then build up to a longer jog, working on your distance.     A good preparation before the marathon will have you beginning at least 3 months in advance. Start slowly and build up.     Get a physical checkup, especially if you have any physical limitations.

La preuve par cette tude.       A quelle vitesse ce dplace un troupeau de gnou?  Et bien  la vitesse de son gnou le plus lent, et quand le troupeau est menac par un prdateur, ce sont les gnous les plus lents et les plusfaibles qui meurent en premier. Cette slection naturelle est bnfiquepour le troupeau dans son ensemble, tant donn que la vitesse gnrale et la sant du troupeau s'amliorent avec la disparition rgulire des lments les plus faibles.    De la mme fa?on, le cerveau humain est contraint de fonctionner  la vitesse de son neurone le plus lent. La consommation d' alcool, comme nous le savons tous, dtruit les neurones, et naturellement attaque en premier les neurones les plus lents et les plus faibles.    Dans ce sens, la consommation rgulire d'alcool limine les neurones les plus faibles, favorisant constamment un fonctionnement performant et rapide du cerveau. Le rsultat de cette tude neurologique profonde vrifie et confirme la relation causale entre les murges de fin de semaine et le rendement de mes consultants, mathmaticiens, ingnieurs, conomistes, avocats, designers, etc...     De ce fait cette tude explique pourquoi, peu aprs la fin des tudes universitaires et la clbration du mariage, la majorit des professionnels ne peut maintenir le niveau de rendement des jeunes dipl?ms. Seuls ceux qui persistent dans leur rgime strict de consommation vorace de produits alcooliss peuvent conserver le niveau intellectuel qu'ils avaient durant leurs annes universitaires. Pour toutes ces raisons, prenons donc les armes.     Pendant que notre pays perd son potentiel intellectuel nous ne pouvons rester sans rien faire. Allons aux bars !

En caso de que el alimento sea alto en protenas, lo ms seguro es que se deseche lo que no sea utilizado, con excepcin de grasas y azcares, los cuales si pueden ser almacenados.    En el caso del deportista que planteas, no sera posible su rendimiento diario con una dieta mal balanceada. Normalmente las dietas de los deportistas deben estar balanceadas para proporcionar los nutrientes adecuados a su actividad.

Good protein in eggs,meat,milk and such is not a MAJOR part but needed part of your diet.Red meat does supply iron and amino  9 so don't let anyone tell you to avoid it.Just use your sense of moderation and eat good quality meats...white or dark.It's been shown that venison supplies more of the essentials,less calories and colesteral that beef.Goat also is in that catagory.Eat what you can and check labels.Once you are aware of what you eat you will be weel on your way to a healthier life.

51c7b3844f90510e76b411ddff7688eaaa	Lots of Cardio & weight training. do 30-45 minutes of strength training 3-4 times per week followed by 45-50 minutes of cardio 5-6 times per week. do your strength training 1st, it burns more calories.     cut down on your calories, eat lean protein, and whole grains - bread is not bad, so long as it is whole grain & high in fiber, also eat your veggies & drink lots of water. It is best to eat 1200-1500 calories per day, if you eat less than this your metabilism will slow down, making it harder to lose weight.    It is not recommended that you lose more than 2-3 pounds per week. Rapid weight loss can be dangerous & is hard to maintain. losing weight is difficult because 1 lb is 3000 calories, so you must burn 3000 calories per pound you want to lose.     if you really want to lose the weight you are going to have to use dicipline & work hard. your health is worth it!|`|rMaTC1bpaa	Here are some excersises:  1. practice playing baseball  2. crunches(350 a day or more)  3. walk for a 1 hour  4.

i9YNS5jcaa	There is some science now behind the idea that grapefruit itself can help with fat loss.    A 2004 study the Nutrition and Metabolic Research Center at Scripps Clinic found that adding grapefruit and grapefruit juice to one's diet can result in weight loss.     The 12-week pilot study, conducted by Dr. Ken Fujioka, took a look at weight and metabolic factors, such as insulin secretion, of 100 men and women who participated in the Scripps Clinic 'Grapefruit Diet' study.     On average, participants who ate half a grapefruit with each meal lost 3.6 pounds, while those who drank a serving of grapefruit juice three times a day lost 3.3 pounds. However, many patients in the study lost more than 10 pounds.     The study controlled for factors like diet and exercise levels, and found that even those who did not change their diet or exercise regime experienced the weight loss.    The researchers are not certain of the actual mechanism at work here, but they believe it has to do with chemicals in the grapefruit that reduce insulin levels and cause people to store less calories as fat.    There is also a hypothesis that the acid in grapefruit may slow digestion of carbohydrates, which would also cause insulin levels to remain lower following consumption of a meal.    Before trying this out, you should know that other compounds in grapefruit and grapefruit juice can interfere with the way your body absorbs, processes, and eliminates certain prescription drugs. To avoid "overdosing," you need tell your healthcare provider if you take medication and eat grapefruit or its juice.|`|9clBIk3baa	i have heard about that.  but i doubt whether it will really work|`|MhL6Y2uqaa	lots of people    some studies now are linking grapefruit to development of breast cancer|`|XI1hDp1eaa	I found this>>>    Grapefruit Juice Diet   The Promise:    In 2 1/2 months you should lose 52 pounds.     The Rules:    You must drink eight 8oz. glasses of water daily (64 oz. total per day).   At any meal you may eat until you are full.   You must eat the minimum listed at each meal. (yep, this diet list the minimum you should eat).   You cannot eliminate anything from the diet. Especially the bacon at breakfast and the salads. You must eat the bacon and salads. These combinations of food burn the fat, omitting one part of the combination will cause the whole thing not to work.   The grapefruit juice is important because it acts as a catalyst that starts the burning process. Don't add or reduce the amount of juice.   Cut down on coffee, it affects the insulin balance that hinders the burning process. Try to limit to 1 cup at meal time.   Don't eat between meals. If you eat the suggested foods you will not get hungry.   You can fry food in butter and use butter generously on vegetables.   Do not eat desserts, breads, and white vegetables or sweet potatoes.   You may double or triple helpings of meat, salad or vegetables.   Eat until you are stuffed. The more you eat the more weight you will lose.   Stay on the diet 12 days, then stop the diet for 2 days and repeat.   Diet Plan:  Breakfast:    8 oz. juice (unsweetened)   2 eggs any style   2 slices of bacon   Lunch:    8 oz. juice (unsweetened)   Salad with any dressing   Meat any style and any amount.   Dinner:    8 oz. juice (unsweetened)   Salad with any dressing OR a red or green vegetable cooked in butter or spices.   Meat or even Fish any style cooked any way.   Coffee or Tea (1 cup)   Bedtime Snack:    8oz. glass of tomato juice or 8 oz cup of skim milk.        http://www.idiet4u.com/diets/fruitjuiced...    But I have never heard this before. Good luck!

D82wWDsGaa	Your a victim of religion.  You're whole life you've been taught to feel guilty about sex, when it is a natural human thing (especially in growing males).    And now you feel a cross emotion within yourself.  You desire sex, and feel guilty at the same time.  Its actually very sad.  I can't believe all these Aholes are telling you to get therapy and go back to church.    If sex is so bad, how do you think you got here? And if your folks tell you they waited till marriage, they're lying.  And if you ever do find someone who waited till marriage, they're not happy.  I promise.    Go with your urges.  Print this out, with everyone else's stupid answers and save it for as long as you can.  When you're 50 yrs old, with next to nothing left in your sex drive, you're going to look back and say to yourself one of two things:    A) Gee I wasted my entire life and I wish I could go back and enjoy my twenties    or     B) I lived a fulfilling life with as much pleasure as I could possibly have had.

IiQNfmhhaa	One to 1.5 grams of protein times your lean body mass if you are working out with weights vigorously. Makers of protein supplements recommend more. (I wonder why?) If you are overweight your lean body mass is probably something less than 74% of your total weight. You need a variety of food also  to make sure you get some carbs and good fats which will also contain vitimans and minerals.    Go to the FDA.gov website. They have some good food info there.     You can't build a lot of muscle unless you work them hard and rest adequatley between workouts. You are tearing muscle fiber when you work out vigorously. That's why you are sore the first couple of times you work out. After the workout your body begins to repair the fiber and add more to prevent the "trauma" from occurring again. We fool the body by adding more weight the next time we work out. The re-buliding process takes 48-72 hours rest, good nutrician and is just as important as the workout.     Just adding protein to your diet won't grow muscle. If you need proof do this. Eat 300 grams of protein per day for a 2 weeks and don't do any exercise. The next 2 weeks only eat 40 grams of protein, workout vigorously with 48 hrs of rest between workouts . Compare your strenght gain for the two periods.     Egg whites, fish, turkey, chicken, skim milk, and lean meat are excellent sources of protein.|`|WNIERswTaa	Exercise to gain muscle and eat sufficient protein.|`|r8DHXS8kaa	go online and type in "calorie king". this website allows you to type in any food and get the calories and other nutrients contained in each food. or if you want more specific info then go online and type in "nutrition" or "foods with high protein content".

IiQNfmhhaa	No. You need to vary the types of food. Also cut out the Life Cereal. Substiute schredded wheat, oatmeal or egg white and slice of toast.  Eat some turkey or fish instead of the cottage cheese once in a while.  You are not eating bad foods (except for the Cereal) but you need more variety. Add a few (6-8) almonds or walnuts You are problably not overweight. If you are small frame the least you should weight is 108. Medium - 118. Large 128. To determine frame, wrap your thumb and middle finger around your wrist just below your hand. If they overlap slightly you are small frame. Barely touch- medium. Don't touch- large. Four pounds a month would be ideal for you if you don't get more than 5 pounds lower than the lowest weight for your frame size. Anything else borders on unhealthy if not outright unhealthy.|`|h5DETIg7aa	To have a balanced diet, you need to be eating more thant just fruit and cereal.  You need to have the right proportions from each of the food groups.  What you are doing is not healthy for your growing body!|`|FvROFCzTaa	You need some carbs and protein in addition to what you are eating.  At lunch add a half a tuna sandwich.    For supper think about some chicken and vegetables instead.      Check out the Fitness magazine and Shape magazine websites.  They have some great articles for meals and healthy eating.
xlEJC4w3aa	Every boy is different in the stages of developement. No one boy will develope at the same age. An deoderant has nothing to do with it either.

FrE4s6sfaa	For the last couple of months I have been using this machine at least 2-3 times per week. Sometimes for 30 min., sometimes 1 hour. I have noticed a difference in my legs and thighs. My stomach, not as much, but some. 115 lbs is certainly not overweight but I know kids your age are body conscious. My daughter is 11, 5'1" and weights 124 and she stays freaked out about it. She goes to the gym with me sometimes and works out. I'm sure you look just fine the way you are, but it certainly won't hurt if you want to get some exercise.|`|8c525dc4cc6f746fc2d5bcd85d27f9e3aa	Yeah probably, that's quite a cardio workout.  There's only so much weight you can lose though, which is fine.  Your body will start to develop and tone muscles.
577c65badc4c3c922a9ed289ba83e4a6aa	someone else can give you a serious question; I'll give you the realistic one.  No matter how many calories you lose, you'll put on water weight when you return home because the weather is too hot out there these days.  And it depends on "how" you ride your bike as well.  For instance, it would take a lot longer to lose weight if you were sitting on your bike than being off the seat and peddling the whole three hours.  I would think that the repetitiveness of day after day doing that same 3 miles would help you lose weight by losing calories though.  I walk to the store it takes 30 minutes to get there (spend a few minutes picking up the groceries) and 30 minutes back, and it's almost a mile, yet I lost 17 pounds.  I think walking is better because you don't have to make stops inbetween and you can continually use your legs.  Although that takes weight off, it does tone your legs, hips and tummy.  You will find that in life you don't need equipment to stay in shape, and you don't need to pay to be in with a group of people  to lose weight either.  Pace yourself so that you don't have to consume so much liquid because liquid is heavy and will put weight on you (not only makes you jiggle but makes the scale numbers go up like ten pounds).|`|pPnHHt4Xaa	You have to take in account lots off things, such as your weight, activity level. ect  Visit fitday.com it is a free site, you can put your information in and it will tell u how many calories you burned each day.|`|rMaTC1bpaa	you will lose mayb e 2-3 pounds a week. but do more than just biking. because if you just bik, you will gain muscle and gain weight. walk for 30-60 minutes everyday, do situps, jog, anthing to get you heart reat up!

olrDTwG8aa	Your first 'love' will always be the strongest thats normal.  You sound like you are looking for all the right things about him and miserably missing all the other things. Stop building him up, he's not perfect - I'll bet he has numerous faults (we all do) you just weren't with him long enough to see them.    The fact that you mention money and how much he makes is not a positive.  The best people in the world aren't rich in wealth but rich in soul, experience and their nature.  (Thats not to say that rich people can't be nice too!) Come on, stop putting yourself in the victim role of being the 'stepping stone' this is a normal part of our growth as a human.  You don't just date one person, marry them and die with them. We all date numerous people and from each one we learn a little bit more about ourselves.      Move on, don't play the victim in your head and accept that it was what it was - a fling for him and just a few dates for you.  You too 'have it all' - you have a man who loves you.|`|FxAWhiTWaa	Its the 'Forbidden Fruit' syndrome.

Eat only when hungry and not more than thrice a day. Nothing other than water in between. Include plenty of uncooked vegetables and fruits in each meal, preferably 50%. Chew each morsel at least 32 times to activate ur body to generate signals of hunger/fullness. Obey these signals.    Take light exercises and brisk walks regularly preferably twice a day.    U will achieve what u have not even dreamt and that too in a reasonable time. Do not be in a hurry. It is however to be noted that one cannot change the shape or size of different parts of the body.|`|ExARBYo2aa	http://www.revolutionhealth.com/healthy-...    http://weightloss.about.com/od/eatsmart/...|`|lSeAj447aa	I would look up Body Mass  Index Calculator or Calorie Calculator....they will give you the answers your looking for.|`|JZaF0sHNaa	To find out your ideal weight, go to http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht... and enter your height, weight, gender, and age.    As for calorie intake, try around 2000. Also be sure you eat only when you're hungry. That may sound strange, but a lot of times I'll be watching TV and wishing I had something to eat, just for the sake of eating it.     Also try to get low-cal, low-fat, low-carb, and low-sugar food. That way, you can eat more but have less calories. And don't drink regular pop, it's a total waste of calories. I for one would much rather eat some extra calories and drink water. Yes, drink water! It helps with your metabolism.  If you're not a fan of water, try Crystal-Lite or flavored water.     And don't forget to exercise! Exercising is not fun and often hard and uncomfortable. But if you do a little bit more every day, you might even find you like it! Try finding a fun exercise video. There are yoga, plain old cardio, dance routines (including bellydancing and salsa!) and my personal favorite, Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease. (Assuming you're female, you'll also learn a new skill that can come in handy, and it will be good for your self-esteem).    Everything I just suggested, I am currently doing. I'm the same height as you, and I weigh a little more, but I've already lost 15 pounds in 2 months.

uV9ZYnKWaa	Raices   Hamilton Naki (26 de junio de 1926  29 de mayo de 2005) fue un   asistente mdico y maestro sudafricano, sin ninguna formacin acadmica, al que se ha reconocido por colaborar con el doctor Christiaan Barnard en las investigaciones que dieron origen al primer trasplante de corazn exitoso, aunque en ocasiones se le ha atribuido incorrectamente intervencin en el trasplante.  Carrera mdica  Naki fue seleccionado por Robert Goetz de la Facultad de Medicina de la universidad de Ciudad del Cabo, para trabajar en los laboratorios de la clnica, donde ayud inicialmente con los cuidados de los animales del laboratorio (una tarea tediosa y desagradecida). Por ejemplo, Goetz menciona que le pidi ayuda para sostener una jirafa mientras l la operaba. Muy pronto se vio involucrado en procedimientos quirrgicos en el laboratorio, incluyendo suturas y analgsicos, as como cuidados despus de la operacin. A pesar de su carencia de estudios formales, su tcnica y capacidad fueron reconocidas, y recibi un permiso especial para continuar la investigacin en los laboratorios con animales, incluyendo transplantes, aunque nunca pudo ser reconocido ni trabajar como mdico con humanos. Esto ocurri en la poca del apartheid.    Naki se convirti en uno de cuatro tcnicos del laboratorio de investigacin de la Facultad de Medicina. Asisti a los cirujanos jvenes en sus entrenamientos en el laboratorio animal, donde stos realizaban investigaciones en trasplante de ri?ones, corazn, e hgado, para obtener experiencia. A pesar de ser enumerado en los expedientes del hospital como un limpiador o jardinero, le pagaron el sueldo de un tcnico de laboratorio mayor, la paga ms alta que el hospital poda dar alguien sin un diploma.  Retiro  Naki se retir en 1991 con una pensin de jardinero, y tras el fin del apartheid, recibi en 2002 un reconocimiento por su trabajo: la orden nacional de Mapungubwe en bronce y un grado honorario en medicina de la universidad de Ciudad del Cabo en 2003. Durante su retiro, arregl un autobs para convertido en una clnica mvil. Muri el 29 de mayo de 2005, a la edad de 78 a?os.  |`|b3DUo90jaa	Pues no tena ni idea, ni me apeteca mirar, pero ahora ya se quien era.

IiQNfmhhaa	If you don't lose fat and carry most of it in your mid section you can do a thousand sit ups per day and not see your ab muscles. Everybody has "six pack:" abs. However for most people they are covered up by fat. Building muscle all over is going to help you lose fat. You are doing plenty of situps to tone and build your ab muscles. The "70 second hold" is doing very little  for you. And the AC thing is just making you less comfortable and is slightly counter-productive to  achieving your goal. You burn more calories when you are cold. Also get out and walk or jog for 30 minutes.    I see plenty of overweight people doing 100s of sit-ups and working on ab machines at the gym. I'm sure they have toned and large ab muscles but nobody can see them for the fat covering them up. You don't see fat on people with "six packs".|`|IeDf6kRtaa	i bet it is enough..    don't try too hard...    hope your diet will success soon...    >.

They won't show as a 6 pack unless you eat healthy. Good luck!|`|zxE7GINCaa	Thats awesome but ive heard that you should do 30 min of cardio either before or after ab-work, it will burn off fat and then your ab routine will push your muscles out.   also dont eat sweets and eat lots of protein (i know duh answers but trust me it helps) but good proteins not like beef it sits in your stomach (gross) but stuff like chicken (grilled not fried) peanut butter, fish, nuts, and stuff like that.also lots and lots of ice-water each 8 oz of ice-water (make sure its ice) burns like 30 extra calories so drink up!  best of luck to ya!  if you really put your heart and body to this you will definitly look like zac efron.   -chartop15
70c1b3c790052f6e461650e422866ad8aa	You're far better off getting your vitamins from the food you eat than a supplement. The supplement is good as an extra precaution but your body absorbs vitamins much better from fruit and veg. When you factor in pollution, smoking, drinking, poor eating habits, number of sex partners, medications, and other high risk behaviors, not to mention, hormones and heredity (the biggest factor is genetic).

Masturbating at all in public is illegal. What he is doing is a form of sexual harassment.    Personally I thinking that maybe you like the guy more than you are letting on. Or you're just not seeing the seriousness of this issue.    Look this is serious. Guys who behave like that are like a ticking time bomb. If this continues I can almost garuntee you that it will escalate into further and more worse forms of harassment. If this guy is bold enough to masturbate to you in class(you know he's thinking about you because he's staring at you) then there is no reason to assume he is not capable of stalking you or doing something else.      You need to tell this guy to stop and if he continues you need to tell the teacher. If he gets in trouble it might make him mad and that is his problem. He shouldn't be doing that anyway.   |`|GyMHFfjGaa	lolo, idk, tell him to chill out with that bull|`|HfWRw6tAaa	LMAO I never done that just tell him next time he jacks off, ur gonna tell the teacher. that should make him keep it in his pants?|`|57Fgjic5aa	Tell him to stop, if he doesn't say something to the teacher or just in the middle of class yell out omg quit masturbating.

Tell him also that you feel that he's masturbating to you and that you'd really appreciate it if he'd stop. He's probably wanting someone to look back and see what he's doing. Showing a part of his body like the penis is indecent exposure and if you really felt like this was too much to handle, go to the administration. I'm sure if you befriend him and ask why he's doing it and ask him to stop, he'll stop. Hope this helps.|`|CEwNMvMzaa	Let me get this right, he masturbates and he stares at you and you dont like it. Now you are seeking advice on how to get him to stop without embarrassing him..?? Huh..?? Arent you embarrassed when he masturbates in front you in the first place..? Are you serious..? I would jam a damn fork In his penis if he does that to me.    And there is a teacher right..? Simple..!! TELL YOUR TEACHER..!!! or your mum..? or his mum..? call the police..? the psychiatrist ? a vet ? a mental institution for him and yourself ?     Or maybe you can join him by masturbating yourself.|`|nGYy9lxuaa	first of all ask your teacher if you can move   even if you have to lie and say you cant see the bored  or you can tell them your not comfortable next to him    or   you can tell him to stop because its not appropriate  I mean if your a senior thats really not appropriate     hope this helps  |`|IVq33DcQaa	Pre tend you don't know what he is doing and ask what he is doing.|`|FxAWhiTWaa	i would just scream and draw attention to him right when he is really starting to enjoy himself.

IiQNfmhhaa	If you are overweight you may have developed type 2 diabetes at your age. Sounds like you need a good physical with some blood work.    Exercise and sweating will not inherently cause you to get sick. If you exercise without adequate rest in between you could be lowering your immune system. The exercise and sweat didn't cause you to get sick the lack of sufficient rest did.     If you  eat junk foods and drink a lot you could be lowering you resistance to the flu. If you eat right, exercise and rest sufficiently in between your immune system will get stronger.|`|8cFc22AJaa	Working out should help your immune system not weaken it. If that was the case you will hear about it on the news. Just make sure the Gym you work out in is clean and avoid eye and mouth contact while working out. Make sure you wash you hand before getting in your car and going home. To be on the safe side maybe you should wipe of the gym equipment with anti-bacteria wipes before you use them. If you still get sick you should see a doctor.|`|5ftJATPSaa	From what I know & have experienced...excercise should be good for your immune system.

LWMKkxWWaa	Podes usar os tamp?es mesmo se tiveres tido a primeira menstrua??o h pouco tempo. O hmen, que  uma membrana de pele que rodeia a entrada vaginal, tem uma abertura natural, a qual permite a passagem dos fluidos. Quando a menstrua??o come?a pela primeira vez, o hmen  normalmente suficientemente macio e flexvel para te permitir utilizar, facilmente e sem o ferir.          "Eles devem ser trocados com freqncia", aconselha Thomaz Gollop. "Nunca se deve esperar mais do que seis horas para fazer a substitui??o", especifica Claudio Basbaum. Isso porque o sangue  um meio favorvel ao desenvolvimento de microorganismos que podem provocar contamina??es. Alis, caso haja alguma infec??o vaginal,  mais prudente passar longe dos absorventes internos  mas, claro, a ltima palavra  do especialista. "Os absorventes externos tambm podem propiciar esse tipo de problema", pondera o ginecologista Soubhi Kahhale. "Eles abafam a vagina, o que tambm cria um ambiente favorvel a fungos e bactrias",  diz. "Alm disso, o material usado na sua fabrica??o s vezes provoca irrita??o na mucosa local e a, muitas vezes,  at melhor recorrer ao tamp?o."    se continuar com duvidas veja esse site :    http://www.obviamente-ob.com.pt/faq/?top...    boa sorte. .:)|`|L7xxgZLOaa	N?o!

IiQNfmhhaa	Everyone has the "washboard" stomach you see on low fat people. The problem it is covered up by their fat. If you don't lose the fat you are not going to see the muscle underneath. So you can't just do crunches and other ab excecise and expect to have the same look. You're going to have to lose all the fat. I see a lot of people in the gym doing 100's of crunches for months and I still haven't seen those ab muscles.     You're gonna have to eat well and add muscle all over your body and burn a lot of calories. (Calories consumed - calories burned) divided by 3500 = lbs of fat lost or gained over a given period of time. Extra muscle will burn extra calories even while your sleeping. You don't want to consume less than 1500 calories a day because that would be counter-productive. Your metabolism would slow down as a result of your body going into "starvation defense".     Thirty to 60 Sit-ups and leg raises a day is enough to tone and build the msucles. Hold a 5 lb- 10 lb  weight on your chest while dong set-ups if they are too easy without it. Three sets of 12 reps on an ab machine 3 times a week would be good. Try to walk, jog or run for 30 minutes at least 4 times a week.    If you carry most of your fat around your mid-section you are gonna have to work harder than someone who doesn't. That will be the last fat you lose. Good luck!
g3PSieClaa	The absolutely best way to lose weight in a three week time frame is as follows:  Cut out all processed foods, including sugar only eat the following:  any fresh fruit except avodados  any fresh vegetable except potatoes  lean chicken breast   lean turkey  and EXCERCISE at the minimum walk at least 1.5 miles a day.

You will lose at least 15-20 lbs in 2 weeks if you do what it says. I lost 10lbs in a week so I know.|`|IiQNfmhhaa	Do moderate - intense weight training 3 times a week and walk or jog 2 miles in 30-40 minutes twice a day at least 6 days a week. Reduce carbohydrate intake (about 30 grams a day) and eat low glycemic carbohydrates (vegetables that are not white). Eat no more than one piece of bread per day. Drink at least 100 ounces of water spread evenly through the day and more while you are exercising. After the 3 weeks you can moderate this regimen but continue to do it. It will be healthy. You don't want to have short term weight loss habits. Yo-yo weight control is unhealthy.  Remember 3500 calories = 1 lb.  Calories consumed/3500 - calories burned/3500 = lbs lost or gained.|`|AA11650378	umm yeah ur goin to hear this alot, DIET AND EXERSISE!!!!!    okay so u should intake around 1200 calories a day    [and these calroirse should not be from fast foods]    exersie like 3-5 times a week    [ u know maybe hit the gym, or play some friendly football for an hour, umm yoga karate, well yeah]    hope this helped
b7daf7f145436c81faf52b6909fd5a8daa	Le cancer est une forme de maladie dgnratrice, le cancer se dveloppe qd l'organisme n'arrive plus reprer et rparer les lsions (spontane ou induite) de son ADN (au + les cellules se multiplient au plus le risque de cancer est grand), et/ou qd le systme imunitaire n'arrive pas/plus a reconnaitre les cellules anormale et les dtruire. Le vieillissement de la population augmente donc la frquence des cancers (ce sont des maladie latente, elle peuvent mettre plusieurs dizaines d'anne a se dclarer, avant les personnes mourraient d'autres cause avant la dclaration des sympt?mes de la maladie(ex: les cancer induit par l tabas, on a mme retrouver des trace de cancer sur des momies egyptienne).A cel s'ajoute la prsence accrue de certain oncogne (+/- contre balanc par l'augmentation de la prvention), les modifications de style et de rythme de vie (allimentation, stresse, activit physique etc) qui augmentent elles aussi les risques de cancers.  Et il y l'amlioration de la mdecine et des technique de diagnostiques et d'imagerie. Bien des maladies qui taient class comme des "longue fatigues", "des infections a rptitions" etc se sont avre tre des cancers. Au plus les mthodes diagnostiques volueront, au plus on diagnostiquera des cancers et surtout des cancers a un stade prcosse chez les plus jeunes.  Tu a un autre parramtre, plus dlicat: beaucoup de cancers ont des bases gntique (facteurs de risque), actuellement les avance de la mdecine permettent a des personnes avec une mauvaise sant (ou qui on fait des cancers durant leur enfance) d'arriver a l'age adulte et donc de transmettre ces gnes (facteurs de risques) a leurs dssendance.On sais aussi que certaines infections actuellement banales et soignable, induisent voir augmentent le risque de cancer (plusieurs annes aprs la gurison).|`|O7AS2uVSaa	c'est surtout genetique,il y a des familles qui developpent plus de cancer que d'autres nous avons tous en nous le petit crabe qui sommeille,et quand il trouve le moment propice pour se developper(choc psychologique,stress,divorce,)      toute les choses de la vie moderne,avant on disait que les gens mouraient d'un mauvais mal maintenant avec la madecine moderne on arrive  soigner 80%des cancers du sein et la medecine progresse|`|LDIBNstYaa	Il y en a plus et pas plus en mme temps, je m'explique.

Have you ever eaten a lot of garlic and then your sweat smells of it the next day? Well its the same concept. Also it depends on how hydrated you are.    As for porn... Thats tricky. The law says you cant look at adult material until youre at least 18 but then again... some people think the Victorias secret catalog is porn. But it isnt legally considered to be such.

zmue9Renaa	First of all your weight is a good one for your height.  If you are 5'4" your weight should be around 120-130 so you're way off there.  I wonder if you actually know how much these people really weigh or are you just guessing?  Or are you inventing a rational for you loosing weight?      You also don't tell us your age.  That's important because you might be in a growing spurt during which your weight would fluctuate.      What you could do is make a journal of what you're eating.  Then do a little research:  find out what the food groups are and how much you should be eating of each.  Compare...  You might find you're eating empty calories like soda, fast foods or snacks (chips etc.).  These will add up and put weight on.  You're looking for a healthy compromise.  Then look at how much you exercise.  That will tone you and you could loose inches without excessive weight loss.  Also  remember the best thing you could do for yourself is to drink 8 glasses of water each day.  It flushes your system and that is very important ...especially for weight loss.    Realistic weight losses are 2 pounds per week.  If you go on a fad diet you might start off loosing but in the end you won't so don't even waste your time and effort.      The last thing is to try to get a realistic look at yourself.  Why are you so unhappy with who you are?  If you answer that questions everything else should fall into place.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	Your body shape is apple, which means you have to be really careful not to gain too much body fat around the middle.

It usually reflects some underlying process. While medication is often used to treat insomnia, you should discuss this with your physician first. Insomnia, is, in fact, best dealt with by including cognitive-behavioral therapy. This simply means education about sleep, and a few simple methods that may help patients sleep.     1.  Follow the rules of good sleep hygiene     2. See a doctor. This is especially true if your symptoms are new. Because many of the causes of insomnia are due to medical disorders, the doctor can help you sort this out. In many cases, consultation with a sleep specialist will help.     3. Take a warm bath. This often helps. Bringing heat to the muscles often relaxes them and lets you get to sleep.     4. Get a massage. Again a good muscle relaxing technique. However, make sure that whoever is doing the massage knows how to do it. Causing pain never helped anyone get to sleep.     5. Listen to music. Actually, any soothing noise (played softly) in the background may help. Rap or heavy metal music is probably not the way to go. Rather light, or relaxing, music helps many people sleep.     6. Drink warm milk. Milk has L-tryptophan, an amino acid that helps bring on sleep. Adding honey can often help. However, if dairy products give you diarrhea, then skip this one.     7. Drink herbal tea. Make sure that this is decaffeinated.     8. Sleep on a firm mattress. This is a no-brainer. Sagging or poor quality mattresses can lead to difficulty maintaining sleep.     9. Sleep with your head facing north (magnetic) and feet facing south. Some people swear by this.    10. Count something. The old counting sheep technique works as long as the setting in your mind is a peaceful, slow-moving scene. Concentrating on a mental image often relaxes the rest of the body and allows you to fall asleep.    11. Relaxation techniques. These are often very useful.|`|Sp5ZXBhdaa	Talk to a doctor about this see if he can prescribe you something or maybe even find out what's causing this. Other than that what I use to do whenever I had insomnia was to meditate.

Lube make it more smoothly and decrease the pain , BUT  the bad thing is too much lube on your penis might get small red dots on your penis , those red dots are made when your penis applied with lube for more than 1 hours time . When the lube drys on your penis , its hard to get it off and you need to wash it off. Another bad thing is the lube inside girls vagina , its comfortable but same thing as the penis , vagina will get a hot fire pain inside her vagina near the hole ( inside ) . Need to wash it out .

CRUNCHES sit ups will mess up your back. and you are sore because you do not have enough water in your system. Ive been a hardcore lifter for about a year, and i get a gallon a day, with 6 meals daily. If you want to build muscle you need protein protein protein. If your 150 then u need 300 grams of protein daily, so 300 / 6 meals is 50 grams a meal. Also dont eat complex carbs like pasta because all carbs (which are energy) that you dont burn off will turn to fat. Also in bodybuilding you want to be PROPORTIONED, so the abs, bi's , and chest is typical newbie stuff. You need back, legs, chest, shoulders as your main movements, then add in Triceps with chest, TRAPS with shoulders, and Biceps with back.

jSoIu7ulaa	Tell them you are happy the way you are, and they are only trying to correct you because they see a reflection of them selves before they became over weight.     Next time when they hint or say something about your weight play it off as they said something realy funny, because you know its not true.|`|54584be41adb64f9b6e8e05f340e3cabaa	Wow, you've got some unedifying, brainwashed parents.  I do too, unfortunitely.  My mom is obsessed with dieting and my dad hints and openly mocks chubby people.  My sister has become obsessed along with my mom, to please her.  My brother is always asking if he is fat as well.  They diet and their weight goes up and down.  I used to do it with them, but then I took some classes on nutrition, eating disorders, and women's rights.  I realized that this is all BS and gave it up.  Now I'm FREE and I love my body.  I haven't been on a scale in three years.  Don't let them pull you into their vision of a "perfect" woman's body.  You are great just the way you are.  If you have a healthy weight, then they are just plain wrong.  You should call them on it and do your own thing.  Tell them to go pound sand.    Find a method exercise that you enjoy and do it every day. Build muscle. Eat what you want when you are actually hungry and stop before you are stuffed full. Try to eat a balanced diet, but don't limit yourself with a bunch or rules and diets. Diets don't work and are unhealthy in the long run. Only do things that are healthy and that you can do forever, for the rest of your life, like cutting fast food forever.  95 percent of dieters gain it all back in one year and 99 percent do in two years.  Dieting is associated with weight gain over a long period of time.    If women like you learned to love their bodies, a billion dollar industry that cashes in on insecurities and making people feel like they are not good enough would collapse. Quite frankly, being a little fat isn't as unhealthy as being thin. Anybody who thinks diets or restricting food types is a good idea is uneducated about the human body. Short cuts do not work. Most of the weight you lose is water weight. For health, eat a balanced diet and exercise for the health and endorphins and forget about an ideal shape. The average age a girl starts dieting is 8. 1/3 women are on a diet at any given time. 4/5 US women are unsatisfied with their appearance. You are beautiful and your body has a set point weight that it wants to be. If you starve yourself, the body will fight back by lowering the metabolism to maintain it's ideal weight. Limit your tv viewing. 1/4 TV commercials send out a message about attractiveness in this brainwashed society that has been seeing images of beautiful skinny women and mocking chubby people. It's worse for women: look at the number of average or uglier guys on tv and in movies versus the number of women. 30 percent of women in a study rated their ideal shape and it turned out to be 20 percent underweight. Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz meet the clinical requirements for anorexia, and so do 25% of playboy centerfolds. If the flippin mannequins became real women, they wouln't be able to menstruate. Women finally get some rights, but we limit ourselves like this and our bodies are reduced to objects we inspect and criticise. Men decide to only value women for their looks and a thin, attractive wife symbolizes social status for them. Girls call each other fat as the greatest insult they can muster. When did fat become worse than cruel, stupid, dishonest, lazy or cowardly. When did "chubby" start to mean the last four of those things?   We are killing our daughters and wasting our lives trying to meet an ideal that blows. Unless you are considered obese, or have a BMI of over 25, don't worry about it. In the long run, who cares about ten vanity pounds? Love your body and your confidence will light up the room and give other women permission to love themselves too.   Including your mom.

7f19382fac2ad8f7bd8cdf9d2f73c3d8aa	The excecise of the various miltiary boot camps varies. The marines boot camp is probably the toughest. It can be a huge shock to people who aren't in good shape to begin with. You should  begin an excercise routine prior to going. The closer you are to being in good condition the better your body will adapt to the intensity of the training.|`|kspF7rVQaa	It depends on what you eat and drink. If you are eating healthy, you are likely to drop 1-2 lbs a week. If not, you may just maintain your weight.|`|bMwiV5vDaa	haha, it sounds like your gonna gain weight instead of losing.    becuase you're gonna gain quite amount of muscle...    good luck...lol|`|AA11891740	15-20 lbs? That's my best guess....    NOTE--The more you weigh the more you lose--the more your body burns bc it's working harder. :)    Good luck to you!|`|IiQNfmhhaa	Melissa has it right as well as some others here. You may loose less wieght than you think because muscle weighs more than fat and you are defintely going to gain muscle. You'll probally notice it more in a change in your waist line if that's where you carry most of your fat. It will also depend on how much you eat. A pound of fat contains 3500 calories. Burn 500 calories a day more than you take in and you'll loose a pound. Take in 500 more calories than you burn and you'll gain a pound. At 165 lbs., if you jog  10 miles at 14- 15 minutes  per mile avg ,  you'll burn approximately 1000 calories a day. If you did nothing at all but sit all day you would burn about 1200 calories. So you would burn at least 2200 calories per day if you jog that far. (You are going to burn more than that though.) But using these numbers, If you take in only 1700 calories you'll loose at least a pound per week OF FAT. (Calories consumed-Calories burned)/3500 = lbs. gained or lost
IiQNfmhhaa	"pump" is a term used to describe blood gorging  your muscle when you work it. To build muscle you tear the the muscle cells by heavy exercise. Blood rushes to the area to furnish fuel and oxygen to the muscle to do the extra work. When you rest the torn cells are repaired and new ones are formed because your body's adaptive mechanism doesn't want it to go through the "trauma" again. We fool it by adding more wieght -repeating the cycle.     If your muscle don't "swell' after you work them you are not working them hard enough. If you are doing 3 sets of 10 repititions you should be using enough wieght so that by the eighth , nineth or tenth repitition of the last set you can not complete or barely complete the lift. Four sets of 8 reps or 6 sets of 5-6 reps are good also. Once you can complete the last rep you need to add a little wieght the next workout. The amount of effort you put in  trying to lift that last rep will determine much of the muscle growth. More reps will give you a "pump" but probally won't build muscle as fast. Diet and rest play a BIG part also.|`|5D2MWdQIaa	if you want to build muscle yes|`|AA10301984	what do you mean? you mean pump like strong? if so then yes, whats the point of lifting weights if you dont?
IiQNfmhhaa	You didn't tell us how many calories you are taking in each day. When you get to about 145 lbs you should start seeing some definition. If you do it the healthy way that's about 15-20 weeks away.     I don't think they are that atractive on a female.|`|hwovSZvkaa	Forever if you don't do some serious upper body weight lifting.  I know a lot of women will run away screaming when this gets mentioned, but that's the key.  You can't sculpt fat.  You need muscle to have nice arms.  So do pullups.  I'd also recommend working out closer to 10 total hours a week with short distance sprinting added in, will do wonders for you, much more than a 30 minute session of low-intensity cardio.      You need to eat right as well, which can be tough with only 1500 calories.  Lean meats, plenty of fruits and veggies.  Focus on eating more complex carbs right around the time you workout.  Good luck!
IiQNfmhhaa	good diet and excercise . Everybody has a six pack. Problem is most people have it covered with fat so it can't be seen. Crunches will help some but they are overated. I see a lot of moderately overweight people do a million crunches but I haven't seen their six packs yet.     Cut out the sugar filled soft drinks, chips and fast food. Eat eqq whites for breakfast instead of sugar filled cereal. Eat fish and chicken a lot.|`|AA10943588	sure|`|3c30aa4263d27ab6160b3aeeb8b23303aa	yeh, you sure can, when i was 14 i had the same ambition, i found the most effective method is losing the fat around your stomough, because, you can have the most built stomough mucles in the world but if theyre covered in fat then you cant see them, anyway so yeh, do 30 minutes of cardio exercise 3 times a week (like running and skipping) aswell as situps and crunches, that sort of thing 3 times a week, nothing too heavy but make sure your consistant and you'll definately see results for the chicks ;)|`|gvwdsf8Kaa	if you are overweight, it will take you the whole summer to get it. it you are average weight, it should take at least a month to make the muscles the slightest bit noticable|`|AA11373434	Yes, it's possible, but it's not like as easy as it would for someone with a mature physique. Your body might not be as developed for that yet. Don't forget, I don't care what people say, genetics plays a huge role.   Some people are always looking skinny and cut, and some people are always looking big and buff like me, and it takes little effort for them. Sometimes it takes a huge amount of work.   Some people can't seem to get big and strong, and some can't seem to get cut. If you know you REALLY tried to obtain a certain look and can't seem to achieve it, don't worry, it's not your fault. It's the way you were born. But you won't find out how good you can look until you peak physically, which is when you are near 30 years old anyway!!
hiCu2qZWaa	it doesnt matter how you look in life. sure people judge you on your apperence, but most of the time, your reflection doesnt reflect your personality. everyone is at least a little concerned about their apperence, but honostly, if you are not super fat know one notices, and from the looks of it you are a beautiful person on the inside and outside and are not fat. you are a perfect weight. if you live life to the fullest and are not concerned about the littlest things, you will be happy!!! hope that helped  : ]|`|169a37b1a84a23b6da836db1738dd985aa	Get over yourself.

Gt7MnAG9aa	mashed potatoes...thats all i ate.|`|AA10959322	I got mine out last Friday and I still can't eat normal foods. I have been living on baby food, mashed potatoes, yogurt, jello, smoothies, milk shakes, ice cream, and potted meat (it is soft). It really sucks. I cannot wait to be able to eat normally again. It seems like it will never happen though. :-(|`|9TjGhXp1aa	I would go for a nice milkshake or smoothie but don't drink them through a straw. Good luck with the healing. :)|`|LXTA56rVaa	I mixed in shredded chicken with some mashed potatoes. The key thing is to make sure you have something soft. You can also try a CAN of raviolis or throw in some soup like cream of mushroom, chicken noodle or tomato soup. Eat what you want to eat but make sure it is soft or don't require too much chewing. Having too much pudding and ice cream is not too good for you either. If you want some snacks I would suggest Gerber Graduate crackers(veggie flavored). Those don't taste too bad and melts in your mouth. You can also eat some stew but make sure that the veggies and meat are very, very soft. If those pieces are too big then you can cut them up into mini pieces. I understand the pain...when i got mine out i had anesthesia so i was knocked out most of the day. If you know how to make porridge or congee then you can try that.|`|pet3P8U9aa	I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth cut out last tuesday.. my mouth is Still hurting and i still cant eat normal food... all i ate was icecream and my mom made me ramond noodles.. Easy to swollow.. and macaroni and cheese =) and im still eating that food i tried eating some hard food.. but it killed me and i was in soo much pain!|`|LnvN2UNZaa	I just got mine out 2 hours ago!!! It sucked!! anyways that's all I can eat for now my oral surgen said that today it's just cold soft stuff but tomorrow it can be warm soft stuff, so maybe you can have pasta later??
LXTA56rVaa	haha...I share the same story with you! I did that to my ortho as well. It hurted badly but it did speed up the process. I tried to put more than that, but I woke up in the middle of the night trying to take them off because they hurted so badly. If you want to speed up the process then you want to make sure that you get a tad bit more consistent with them,so they wont move back again!    Good Luck!|`|2LwrGcReaa	No, and it will hurt like the dickens.    Teeth can be moved by putting a certain amount of pressure on them.  The lining of soft tissue around the root responds to this by eating away the bone on one side and forming bone on the other side so the tooth will literally dig its way through the bone.    However, more pressure will not make this process go any faster, since there is a limit to how much pressure this tissue will respond to.  You also may squeeze it so much that the tissue gets injured or even dies.    Just wear the bands as directed and come clean with you orthodontist so he isn't surprised by the rate of movement.|`|252ef082184d50a72139263b871b22c6aa	ya, i think it would speed it up a bit but might be a little painful for a while.   good luck.  sounds like my son.  he is supposed to be getting his braces off on monday.... we'll see about that though since he's been lazy about his rubber bands.....  they are such a nuisance.... i agree.  but  ya gotta wear em!|`|wgQUFL4Uaa	whoa. dont do that, you can break your brackets and you can mess up your mouth,    just go back to wearing one, and if your orthodontist says anything (probley not) just tell them your story or make up a new one. hahaha.|`|6IFM73qeaa	personally, (ive been there by the way!!) i just start wearing them again as i was told to (just 1 band at a time) and tell them that you havent been wearing them consistently, but they will porbably notice and ask yuo about it anyways,  wear the elastics all the time! it'll be worth it when youre finally done
832b6e3c5ceb92e0a01412bade407e1daa	The crunch movement does put stress on your back, (lower especially) mostly because of the way people do sit ups.  They go from floor all the way to their knees and they don't tighten their abs, making their backs compensate for lack of ab control.      Do as many as you feel comfortable with, taking rests in between.  Use common sense -if it starts to hurt, stop.  You can also try different ways to do ab exercises.    -Lift your feet off ground and put your legs up in the air or bent towards your chest and do sit ups like that.    -Work your lower abs by lowering your legs from straight up in the air (perp to the floor) and lower them to 45 degree angle and back up.   -bicycle crunches.  -sitting tall on stability ball, arms behind head with elbows out and feet flat on floor, lift right leg into chest as you bring left arm into chest (bring them together, doing an opposite arm/leg crunch while sitting).  Repeat opposite arm/leg.    Remember whatever you do pull in your abs to your spine, and hold them there the whole time.  If you aren't engaging your abs, your back will compensate and will start to hurt.    And because you are working your torso, you also need a strong back to support it.  Lay face down on ground.  Pull arms back to your butt while lifting your chest.  Don't raise too much off the ground-just 6inches or so.  Hold and release.  Repeat aa few times.  Also you can also lift right arm with left leg.  Or do superman on ground or on stability ball.    And remember to stretch after a tough ab workout.  Lay on ground face down, arms by your armpit.  Press up off ground and do a sort of backbend.  Hold a few, and then push your body onto your knees and hold the position like you are praying.  Face down near your knees with butt on your heels and arms stretched forward.  You can also do a cat stretch -on all fours, curl your spine like a cat would, hold a few, then release.|`|6d3ded815cbc815f4a16fd602248d840aa	yea pto sme matter|`|rMaTC1bpaa	Yes! Keep doing the sit-ups. If it starts hurting your back, put a cusion or pillow under your back or just take a break. Also fast walking for an hour for 2 weeks or so will give you good results. Just keep excersising an you will do just fine. Good luck!
z57P3RHqaa	Depends on your height and weight to start (and your body type).    Remember muscle weighs more than fat, so that will affect you as well.     For me, I am about 5'4, and I started out at 155- size 12, and I went down to 140, size 8. I only lost 15 pounds and went down two full sizes, but I was also in REALLY bad shape to start. That makes a big difference.    It is good to get into good eating habits before college, because I can tell you it hit me hard, and I am still paying for it!|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	The rule of thumb is that 12lbs loss is roughly equal to one dress size.|`|0f14c0173f9efbdc6efd2cf872b13fe1aa	Definitely 20 lbs. I used to weigh 170 lbs. I already lost 30 lbs., and people are still barely noticing it.     You still have a lot of time. But you have to make sure to  exercise at least 20 mins. EVERYDAY.|`|rMaTC1bpaa	15-20 lbs|`|9KIniBETaa	Try weightwatchers - it worked for me - I lost a stone and a half (sorry if you're in the US, too complicated to do the maths) and I have kept the stone off permanently.    You can do it on line or join a group - just doing it on your own with no information won't work as well (sorry!).    Since someone asked a stone is 14 lbs!   A good old English measure which makes sense to us and to lose one is just wonderful!|`|I6On0Xdjaa	It all depends on you! If you are taller it is going to take a little more weight loss, but if you are short it won't take quite as much.    I am 5'8'' or so and I lost about 30 pounds - it took me from a 14-16 dress size to about a 10-12 depending on the item of clothing. While I didn't lose a lot in the dress size department, I feel a lot better and I have gotten a lot of great, uplifting comments. FYI - I did it by just counting calories and walking a lot.    The most important things to remember is not to lose the weight too fast because then it will just come back (AND SOME). Also, just because something worked for me or someone else doesn't mean it will work good for you. Try out different things until you find one you can do and enjoy.    GOOD LUCK and don't be too critical of yourself! :)|`|zykJntBpaa	I was a size 20 and am now a size 10-12. I lost 100lbs. I would say that you would have to lose about 30 lbs.|`|b15ecceacebbe022d87b701de9ddb6ceaa	A few years ago I lost 4 stone and went down 5 dress sizes. After my first stone people started really noticing and I had dropped a dress size and felt the benefits already.     Stick to a healthy diet and exercise and have a positive mental attitude regarding your weight loss and you will achieve what your after. If you have a bad day don't give in just be good the next day.   I wish you the best of luck as I know it's not easy to lose weight.|`|b7ea966794110167e990cd8f038e4a17aa	First of all - what the heck is a stone?  Anyways I lost 65 lbs and dropped 4-5 dress sizes so I would say 13-16 lbs per size.  Try Weight watchers, it works - and it works fast if you follow the program. I lost the first 50 lbs in just under 4 months and kept it off.
pXsW3PBeaa	Sorry for the Honesty, but it sounds as the guy is not interested,  I don't recommend to chase a guy that doesn't show any interest, is part of a women's self respect.  Be friendly and open for interesting conversation when the moment is given, if you try too hard and he noticed he'll avoid you more.|`|rMaTC1bpaa	Talk 2 him when you can. Ask him for his   and call him. Hang out after school or during school. Hopefully after the time you spent together, he will ask you out? If not, then just go for some other guy.

AA10483381	you'll loose about 5-10 pounds + with all those crunches you'll see some amazing abs!|`|I6znnFJDaa	you need to burn 500kcal a day to loose 1 pound a week if you stay on the same diet|`|up4CNbs9aa	There's no real well to predict how much weight you will lose. It will all depend on how many calories you take in each day vs. how many calories you work off each day.
6Gix1D8Qaa	I say walk,walk,walk. I'm your age so I know what a struggle it is. You have to move, swim, stay very active. Drink lots of water and don't eat right before you go to bed.

Nothing other than water in between. Include plenty of uncooked vegetables and fruits in each meal, preferably 50%. Chew each morsel at least 32 times to activate ur body to generate signals of hunger/fullness. Obey these signals.    Take light exercises and brisk walks regularly preferably twice a day.    U will achieve what u have not even dreamt and that too in a reasonable time. Do not be in a hurry.     If u follow the above pattern u will loose the excess weight faster than the rate at which u gained it.|`|StHedcXtaa	it depends on wat you do and wat you eat. the least amount of time is about 2 weeks though|`|16da864bf4fa6ad58cb948b4a821ac19aa	You are 13 years old, so your metabolism is still settling into place. i would say to cut sugar and just start walking places. No need to flip out on the dieting at your age.   Most of it is baby fat and will disappear soon enough.    The weight you are "supposed" to be is the weight you are comfortable and healthy at, even if it is above 130.
Nj8gWwgEaa	The answer to that question depends on a lot of things. It depends on how much you weigh now, how intensely you work out (walk or whatever you do... if youre going to walk power-walk) To say specifically youll lose an extra 10 pounds that month if you do this or that is a bit silly. for one thing if you are extremely overweight you could lose 10 pounds cutting a freakin snack out almost. i think you mentioned before you weight about 160? i suggest a good cardio work out. start out slow but build up. You may gain weight the first while drinking water, because your body gets less of it now and it thinks it needs to store it. but if you keep up the drinking a gallon a day your body will realize it has plenty and will release most of it regularly. i quit red meat and pork and deep fried foods. no fast food, no chips, no cookies, no hamburgers (if youre going to eat red meat keep it lean, like deer meat, or at least a good cut of steak) no fried chicken breasts (breaded chicken a no no) grilled skinless chicken is a good source of protein and low in fat and calories. also you will want to add a weight lifting workout because it will help boost your metabolism and burn more fat. more energy will be used to build stronger and more tone muscles. so not only when you lose the fat on your biceps, the boys will see a nice trim upper arm ;)    i do not think it will be so easy for you to do 500 crunches a day. do 4 sets of 20 for starters then rest. come back to it a little later (within the hour or half hour) and do the same thing. 4 sets of 20. do that a couple times a day. if you do 160 within an hour 2 times a day thats 320. then the next week maybe you can do 4 sets of 30 or 25.. depending on how serious and how well youre doing them. i suggest full situps though because they work your stomach muscles, and back and other muscles as well. some people say theyre worse for your back but ive been doing them a while and im fine and so is everyone else i know in the army.    pushups! hehe... now time for those... youll probably suck at them in the beginning. everyone does. even weight lifters who dont do them have trouble. start out trying to do 10 everytime you enter a room. drop and do 10. also at night do 4 sets of 10 if you can. then move it up just like the sit ups or crunches. this stuff will make you feel terrific i guarantee it.    when you see chips say **** IT. do not eat them! bad bad! do not eat junk! bad! do not waste your stomachs space on sugar loaded things.. sugar is a terrible supplement for energy. youll burn all the sugar off and not touch any of the energy stored up in your body. you want to burn the **** you have that you dont want. stay on a low fat and low calorie diet and dont splurge on the sugar. no soda. none. limit 100% fruit juice also. its all the sugar from the fruits (which is better sugar than soda sugar yes but still you dont need a lot of it)  no trans fats, VERY low saturated fats. stay on about 20 grams of fat a day and a 1250 to 1500 calorie diet. snacks that are good are bananas. they produce HIGH energy for working out and taste bloody awesome. dont waste your time with junk food. its the worst. you could eat 10 pounds of it and want more. its the devils food.|`|23cea7b0cd6ac59b58cf9c9ea285fa06aa	That all depends. How much weight do you want to lose? What are you doing to change your diet?    You can very well do all that, but not change your eating and lose very little weight.|`|LfVepz9Raa	Well if you do also 500 crunches in the morning and before bed,  and drink a gallon of water a day plus your 45 min walk and 30 min yoga you will loose about 20 pound in a month.    But if you also eat only, grilled chicken breast,plain tuna,broil fish, and only popcorn as a snack and eat a meal before 7pm you will loose an extra 10 pounds that month.    popcorn is good as a snack between he hunger pain and water.    and if you stick to your plan you will loose about 10-15 pounds a month.

D4H5hn63aa	If you're hungry, eat tons of fresh fruit, as much as you can, drizzled with tiny amounts of olive oil from a dark container.  If you're not hungry, just drink distilled water.  Go for short walks outside so your body can clean out (it needs to be moving somewhat to accomplish this).  And try not to put anything else in your body if you can help it! :o)    If you can do these two things, your body should be over it within a day, or possibly a few hours.

You should remember to stay dedicated and not to slack off and also you should buy yourself some ankle or wrist weights and wear them all the time to help you lose weight.|`|5b8da55a2d092838379c76034864e2e8aa	good job on the excersize thing, most people leave that part out.    as for your diet, you need to eat more protein and calories to keep your metabolism up. instead of the can of corn for dinner, put some peanut butter on that banana and have a glass of milk. at breakfat, go for a higher fiber cereal like Total or Raisin bran to get more nutrients and keep you full.|`|BFVk2rG6aa	Read tips & Articles on different types of Diets, Exercise Programs, Yoga,Pilate's & much more....    All about Weight Loss, Weight Watchers, Tea Diets, easy Home Exercises to name a few|`|yqhkz0HHaa	well, instead of restricting yourself to 3 small meals a day, eat 4-6 snall meals a day every 2-3 hours. this will really boost your metabolism and fat loss. as for the exercise, tone it down. losing a pound a day is too much to lose at once. do your exercise gradually and aim to lose a pound or so every week. and dont do your crunches and other exercises everyday, since you need to give your muscles a rest. you will also burn more calories when you rest since the muscle are healing. drink about 8 cups of water a day and eat a lot of fruit and vegetables.  in a few weeks time, you will see results.|`|t7lyu9nraa	Ok. Sounds like ur trying to lose weight for school.. if this is it ..dont give yourself a dealine like htat ebcasuse if you dont make it.. will you be upset.    Just make a decision for the rest of your life you want to be healthy.    eat breakfast everyday (ur breakfast looked good)  jsut make sur eyou mix in different fruits and veggies, limit your carbs.. you need carbs for energy jsut dont go out to eat and have 5 dinner rolls.  If you do this youll get tires of ur rice and wheat flakes and ull end up stuffing ur face with whatever sweet food you can find.    then excersize at least 20 minutes 3-4 times a week.    If you really want to lose weight fast now.  The Warm up your body by jogging 10 minutes, or a mile. Jumpng rope is really good. Lunges are great for your butt. Goggle and make sure you do them properly though.  make sure you stretch after your workout too, when your muscles are most plyable.    Dont worry about weight worry about health.  Im 18  5'5 and 185, i work out really hard 6 days a week and i am about to play college softball.    those BMI things dont take into consideration muscle mass.. muscle weighs more than fat.    Just eat healthy and be active. Don't stress yet, plenty of time for that in your 40's|`|7a9d07293ede512668d7bac6055a0308aa	You will lose about 5-10 pounds by September.

AA11744812	The recommended ammount of water to drink is 8 glasses, which would be about 8 oz each.  Tea is always good in moderation.  If it's lipton try to stay away from the ones with the added flavors, raspberry, lemon, sweetened.  Some juices have alot of sugar so again drink in moderation.  Water is still your best bet, if you want flavoring, add one of the powdered drink mixes that are portable, small and low in calories.  One warning though, even though some people drink a gallon of water a day or more, that can actually do more damage to your muscle then good.|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Eat only when hungry and not more than thrice a day. Nothing other than water in between. Include plenty of uncooked vegetables and fruits in each meal, preferably 50%. Chew each morsel at least 32 times to activate ur body to generate signals of hunger/fullness. Obey these signals.    Take light exercises and brisk walks regularly preferably twice a day.    U will achieve what u have not even dreamt and that too in a reasonable time. Do not be in a hurry.  It is however to be noted that one cannot change the shape or size of different parts of the body.|`|iSMIURDbaa	teas and juices have ALOT of sugar. not helpful for dieting.     do water or things like crystal light that have less sugar.    good luck!|`|GjAF9zYoaa	drink 8-12 cups water daily.  diet lipton tea is fine but limit to 2 or 3 a day.  juice is ok but limit to 1 cup a day cuz it's high calorie.

You can lift weights but DO NOT  start lifting to much weight so early take it bit by bit ...  exercise your calves also . You can eat healthy too , purchase a weight lose video or go to Curves For Women . Some of it depends on where your trying to lose the access body fat . Last but not least ,  if you have not surfed the web about this give that a shot ! ohw and also keep doing what your doing . But whatever you do ,  dont take that fat-free food junk or those weight lose pills on the commercials. If that doesnt work try Body For Life . Theres a book about body for life at  *books * a *million* .    GOOD LUCK !!!

Yet people in America complain about sex when they are like 13, and get all pissy when they didn't get that freaking car in blue or that xbox 360 because lo and behold they've actually washed their plate and put the laundry in the dryer, and they complain about being overweight, when kids in Africa only wish they could get past 70 lbs.     bullocks to them I say, eh?|`|0FZixKYbaa	wtf?1 pound?    wow   what a waste of time.|`|Nr0c0JQgaa	do you mean 100 pounds???|`|rMaTC1bpaa	whatever dude.... ask real questions, not unrealistic ones.

NO intentes nada extra?o, ni alimentacin "maravillosa", ni medicamentos de estrella, porque no existen. Olvdate de las yerbas y de aparatos especiales, porque pueden da?ar tu cuerpo.

XChDnnbLaa	Your not that bad off.. i think you can get rid of those pounds you dont need with all of this: or some of it even,.    try this pre diet diet first- if you want.. (( READ ABOUT IT FIRST ))    http://www.storesonline.com/site/786875/...    and then check this out::    in the morning if you can wake up pretty early, thats when you have the most energy! drink a bottle of water plug in your ipod or whatever and listen to music as you run! -- thats my first step.    Then you go home, eat a really healthy breakfast like fruit salad or something thats nutritonal.     After that you pretty much clean the house or whatever maybe take a walk while its cool, walk your pet dog, if you have one, i like to spend the morning doing that while its not so hot outside!    After that you wait a few hours being active as can be, then you relax a little and do some sit ups and lift weights to your own schedule... and your own statistics like weight height goals.. or whatever.. thats what i usually do! And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha    MORE TIPS:     chew gum - sugar free. It makes you not snack because if you chew it, you dont want to snack because then you will have to spit out your gum! works for me..     thats my trick tip - now read the losing weight 411    EXTRA: breathing for an hour burns 60 calories, so thats a little lift off your chest haha  and sleeping is the same rate :)    excersise at least 60 minutes a day if you can :)  -------  hey, you know what? The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help.   8 classes of water a day    the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be.     did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!    Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do!     Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things. Bread is a bad, so try to stick to thin, HIGH in fiber, slices :)     you can google all the stuff and before you know it you will feel so good about it all and IM actually excited to start working out and all that, just because I know what it will do for me!    but if you must go with a diet, try Weight Watchers, its the only one I actually recommend. :)|`|MUiEiuPqaa	google.com  type in BMI  click the first link  type in your stuff  (or just click link below)|`|TI4Yj531aa	well just depends on your build and how much muscle you have.  but just to be on the healthy side you could lose a lil.  try running/jogging..stretching..eating healthier and drinking water. small stuff like that helps bunches!|`|UKpToJpMaa	Yes, you're a bit overweight.

Stay off the soda and junk.  Instead of riding the horses, jog along with them.|`|FpCaIz2vaa	Im about 5'8 and weight about 110 pounds so im not overweight but also not underweight I am your exact same age. Some things I do are just     1. Drink diet sodas and other such beverages  2.Take a 45 minute walk and a fast pace every day  3. Avoid fattening foods  4. Most important!  Dont eat untill you are full, but eat until you are no longer hungry, and dont eat large meals 1 or 2 times a day, eat less more often.    Sorry i know these are all really obvious but I hope they can help.
78PHotKXaa	Buscar una pareja es un buen paso.  Lo otro es, no se, si lo haces en el PC podras hacer un block de notas que diga "DESPUES DE EYACULAR TE SENTIRS MAL!!" (como hablandote a ti mismo) y lo guardas en el escritorio, algo as.  Busca en qu ocupar tu mente, deporte, msica, etc.  Pero por sobre todo, piensa en lo que sentirs despues de eyacular, uno siempre se desespera y no le importa mucho al momento de hacerlo, pero despues de terminar te vienen todas las "culpas".  Por ltimo podras crearte un bito de masturbarte cierto da de la semana: slo los lunes, jueves y sbados (por dar un ejemplo)    Suerte|`|kpkDUJpaaa	estas como yo   yo me masturbo y digo, esta es la ultima vez lo juro   y no es haci   |`|XPwZduF2aa	la masturbacion es muy buena no es mala sirve para conocer tu cuerpo y para muchos ejercicios sexuales es algo natural que la verdadno podras dejar de aser.|`|3KISXWohaa	sencillo solo proponte metas cortas di hoy no me masturbo masque una sola vez en el da al segundo da hoy no me masturbo... y as asta que logres aguantarte prolomenos un par de semanas sin masturbarte y piensa en otra cosa que no sea el sexo qquita te esa mente cochina ja ja jaj|`|dMVCMSeXaa	Es normal, no la dejars hasta que ests listo.

Es una forma de autoconocimiento, a travs de la masturbacin sabs qu te gusta en la cama.

Si fuera una cantidad mayor, provocars un desgaste fsico anormal, por lo que te aconsejo consultar a un sexlogo, o a un siquiatra, porque ya podra ser calificado como obsesin sexual, sera lo que se denomina en medicina "masturbacin compulsiva" y tampoco sera bueno para tu salud mental. Eso no quiere decir que un da en que ests muy excitado eso no pueda suceder; lo que no sera normal es que lo hagas todos los das.  Por otra parte si te masturbas dentro de lo que podramos llamar "lo normal", es decir entre tres o cuatro veces al da y un par de veces a la semana, la masturbacin es una prctica sexual sana y necesaria, especialmente durante la pubertad y adolescencia. Previene de determinadas enfermedades, como la orquitis (inflamacin de testculos que puede provocar impotencia y/o esterilidad), prostatitis benigna y prostatititis cancerosa; asimismo es beneficiosa desde el punto de vista de la salud mental, ya que previene de psicosis y neurosis, debido al efecto beneficioso de las endorfinas, u "hormonas del placer" que su prctica genera.  Por ltimo, mantiene en buen estado de funcionamiento al aparato genital masculino, alejando problemas como esterilidad, eyaculacin precoz, impotencia, etc. Asi que no comprendo que quieres decir con "dejar de hacerlo": sera en todo caso un afn autodestructivo el tuyo, una forma de negarse al placer y a la vida, algo parecido a lo que hace el drogadicto, negarse a vivir. Creo que deberas consultarlo con un siclogo o quiz mejor con un siquiatra.  |`|TPmSsKTSaa	la masturbacion es nesesaria por la gran produccion de espermas que generas, solo recuerda que un abuso de esta practia es la eyaculacion precoz, tu cuerpo tiene que sacar de alguna manera la exesiva cantidad de esperma asi que no sientas culpa por seguir aciendolo |`|KmzTVN2uaa	No se, dime la respuesta cuando la encuentres.|`|0nhxZEHUaa	dependiendo de la edad es la frecuencia, la verdad es que la masurbacion no se deja|`|ov3VfSe0aa	?Sobre la masturbacin?    -eso de la masturbacin esta solo en la mente en fin es como una droga, el cuerpo te pide cada vez mas...    *a mi parecer es muy difcil dejar de hacerlo{comprueba en una encuesta que diga por ejemplo "az dejado de masturbarte aunque digas que nunca mas" ?cual crees que es la respuesta? de todos|`|jiZ6hTieaa	huy..qu tiempos aquellossss..  luego si estas ocupado y emparejado..se te pasa un poco..no preocupes..son etapassss..disfrutalaa no tiene tantos riesgos|`|aZoBvrOQaa	Segn los sexlogos, no hay nada de malo en la masturbacin.

This is for a normal average adult, living in normal conditions of temperature and humidity, taking no particular exercise and wearing average clothes, 2 to 2 1/2 litres a day.    I litre is needed as urine to allow sufficient renal filtering and removal of waste, and  1 to  1 1/2 litres to cover loss from sweating and as water vapour from the lungs.    Small excesses are just peed out. larger excess intake can cause water intoxication, over-hydration, haemodilution, brain swelling, fits and death. yesterdays papers covered the second death from excess water drinking in the past 2 months.

This g-spot reaction can also result in female ejaculation, which occurs when the bladder is flooded with fluid from glands (I forget their names atm). At some point during stimulation, usually do to direct g-spot stimulation, but not always, the fluid can come gushing out.    It sounds to me like you're a squirter. Nothing to be ashamed of. As long as you empty your bladder before hand, it's not urin and you don't have to worry about "peeing."    Lay down a towl and just let it go next time.

7880ad6cbd1decea960f47cab9e65dadaa	Your doctor checked you over; did she do any blood tests or say why you might be dehydrated; like a stomach bug, sports and lack of fluids, heat?  Dehydration can cause an elevated heart rate and thirst, but they can be the symptoms of other diseases too.  Sometimes it takes a day or so to get your electrolytes back to normal after being dehydrated depending on how badly dehydrated you were.  I would follow your MDs advice, drink the 8 glasses of fluid or more that she recommended.    When I say fluids I mean juices, water, and even foods that contain fluids (fruits, soups, popsicles,  different flavored frozen ices and etc).  Stay away from carbonated beverages and beverages containing caffeine as they can increase dehydration.  Caffeine can also increase urine output making your dehydration worse.   Depending on where you live if it is hot, try to stay cool.  Sweating deprives you of fluids too. Take it easy for a day or two if you can while your not feeling well.   Do all of this and if you are still worried call your doctor and tell her that you still aren't feeling well and see what she recommends.  She may even tell you to go to the ER.   Good luck and drink those fluids.<br>  <br>  Below is an article that gives more info on dehydration.|`|R6IYY4miaa	You need to just continue drinking water, keep drinking it and drink as much as your doctor told you too. Drink tea if you're tired of water, and then switch back. Going for an IV will be expensive and time consuming, plus a little painful, and chances are you're not bad enough for one anyway. They'll probably just tell you to go home and drink more water.|`|8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Apart from rapid heart rate dehydration is characterized by dry scaly tongue, dizziness and disorientation. If you have any of these symptoms please go to the ER immediately.<br>  Otherwise continue with oral rehydration. You need not take the fluids in large amounts just sip on them every 30 minutes or so.|`|2eee3d9288232f099e9b265f904ce90aaa	If you're dizzy or disoriented, you should go to the ER.<br>  <br>  Do as your doctor recommended and drink the full 8 glasses of water. You could also drink tea, or juice - if you get bored of just water. Or you could get some flavored water, or crystal light. But the point is - you need liquid! <br>  <br>  Eating fruits and veggies will help too, as foods such as pears, grapes, tomatoes, and bell peppers have a high water content.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Keep drinking more water regularly. Go to sleep for an hour or two and wake yourself up with a cold/mild shower. You'll feel refresh and hydrated.|`|EIINtnIpaa	I Dont Think You Should Go Just Sit On The Coutch Watching Tv Or Something And Drink Some Water|`|AA10275590	If you are severely dehydrated and need IV fluid replacement, your MD  should have admitted you right then. Was any blood work done? Labs would give a pretty good indication of the severity of your problem. Try Gatorade or some other electrolyte-replacement beverage as well as water. Follow up with the MD if your symptoms persist. Lots of other things can cause an elevated heart rate such as stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, etc.

I have so many things I want to accomplish in my day and never feel enough time to do it.  I do need my alone time too or I get real cranky!  I am a multi-tasker and a Mom myself.  If you rise early, you can exercise right at home while watching the news if away from the bedrooms.  Get a rebounder (small trampoline) and get that heart pumping, 10 min a day to start for a week, moving slowly up, have a few walnuts before so you have a little protein in you first. by the end of the month, you will be jumping on your rebounder for 30 min and getting World news... or catching up on favorite shows.    If you like being outdoors, be the cool mom nad get your kids a trampoline and borrow it every morning.  The fresh air does wonders for your brain too!  I recommend it.  I have both small and large tramps.  I personally am an indoor kinda girl but I can see how many would enjoy a morning trampoline with no kids to bother them and want a turn!  good luck.  BTW, A good trampoline will last years and is often cheaper than 2 memberships to a gym!|`|wuqJZUauaa	Reward yourself...<br>  <br>  First start off by getting into the swing of things with new workout clothes and a new pair of gym shoes.

It knows that it needs the nutrients in the food that you ate, and doesn't want to give it up.  If you are guilty after you ate, try to eat healthier foods like vegetables and fruits.  But just make sure you are getting enough amino acids (building blocks of proteins, your body needs them to function) by eating meat.<br>  <br>  Honestly, people who throw up after they eat because they feel 'guilty that they ate food' just makes me wanna punch someone.

mqV9TOv0aa	Maybe the 12 step programs are not your way... They are a good way for many, but you sound like myself, and I needed a single thought to resist drinking. I do not think my thought will work for you though... but then again, who knows why the Spirit has drawn me to this question, and who's life will be changed by this answer.<br>  <br>  When I was a Teen my best friend in the world, whom I was to marry in June, was hit head on by a drunken driver. The impact was so hard that I was called in to identify the head and the body rather than risking a heart attack on her parents... My one thought when I came down with a heavy drinking problem as part of my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder??? I was becoming just like the person who killed my friend. I never have driven while under the influence of anything but coffee and cigarettes, but I was missing work due to being still drunk... My problem was it got rid of the nightmares...<br>  <br>  Find out why you drink. and then either make a total change, and do not go to the places you drink for a full year, or buy yourself a 10-year 5K savings bond to help you get back on your feet when you hit rock bottom and know that the next drink will kill you.<br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  .|`|VELnLnIKaa	you have to want to change you need to recognize your drinking as a problem|`|HMv6jvUCaa	It's only a problem if drinking keeps you from doing things.<br>  <br>  I use to drink everyday, but I was still able to go to school and work two jobs. After a while you will grow out of drinking so much. Just be careful you don't start missing classes or calling out from work because you hung over.|`|AA11292270	I quit drinking over ten years ago, when I was 38.  Frankly, I barely remember my 20s and I don't even want to talk about how bad it got before I finally admitted to myself that drinking simply doesn't work for me.  Probably the most important thing for me was when I came to understand that not only did I never only have one, I didn't really want to only have one.  What I wanted was to get f'ed up with no consequences--but since that was impossible, I had no choice but to quit.<br>  <br>  I did go to AA for a while--a long while actually, long enough to have seen enough insanity and sick behavior to last me a lifetime.  I swear people are healthier out in the bars than they are in AA.  It was just unbelievable.  You would think that people who claim that their lives depend on working a problem of rigorous honesty would be really honest, but most of them are liars, and about 99% are completely  nuts. <br>  <br>  My belief after my many years of sobriety is that alcoholism is not a disease, it's voluntary behavior, and you are completely capable of changing that behavior if you want to badly enough.  At least, that's what happened to me.  It just got to be too much.  I was sick of all the trouble, pain, hangovers, pissing myself, ruining my relationships, etc. and I quit and never looked back.  I'm sure you can too....when it gets to be too much.  I only hope it doesn't take you as long as it took me.  I lost a lot of years.|`|qES5f0tqaa	I will tell you the hardest thing ok listen up. Yes I know someone that has a drinking problem and that is my Son. He started at your age also. His friends and them thought it was fun. Well my son paid and he still is paying. This went on until September of last year. When one of his Buddy's went to his house and seen that he was drinking 2 bottles of Tequila. They then got him help and one guy came home from Iran to help. My son has been sober since then but goes to AA FOR SUPPORT. i THINK YOU NEED TO START GOING you have a problem please don't wait to get help when it is there for you. Also tell your love ones or someone else you fill this way. If you are feeling this way  you get help now before it is to late. Life is short. take care wish the best for you always remember don't give up|`|g2QUNwZzaa	well, i know lots of people that drink too much, but none of them have really given it up yet....so i cant help u there....<br>  <br>  i have an uncle who's older than me (well alot older than me, im probabaly ur age), but he went to Narcotics Anonymous, they told him not to drink alcohol ever again or he could relapse on hard drugs again|`|VJqceupQaa	idk talk to someone|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	The reason you do it is because it's fun and you are self indulgent, maybe a Taurus. But simply put you don't love your BF or you wouldn't be going out drinking without him. Because sooner or later you are going to wake up in some other dude's bed. Personally if I was him I'd kick you to the curb. But since he's obviously stuck on you and a moron, kick him to the curb and go live your life. You'll settle down eventually. Hell I drank to excess almost every day through my 20's and then one day I just quit, it wasn't a conscious decision, I just did. I lost 40 pounds from it, I guess a fifth of Sambuca and a few Guiness's a day is fattening. AA is a joke, of course so are alcoholics. They have to take classes, real drunks are a natural phenom. Go Irish!!|`|8P6MmLv0aa	One of my friends had a problem with alcohol and it mess him up but he got a girlfriend who was a drug user and she got him hook on cocaine then other stuff he court Hep-C through unprotected sex with her and died about two years later I did try to help him but he just did what ever it took to feet his Habit including steeling from my house. its so easy to get court up in all sorts when you are a alcoholic and you lose all your friends and family.<br>  So get help as soon as you can please.|`|ngt2B4QOaa	If you really want to give up you have to find friends that drink less or don't hang around as long with your friend when they start drinking avoiding the temptation is the key. <br>  When they start drinking make an excuse to leave after just two or three.|`|Qlpj04L3aa	Well I'm from WI so everyone I know has this problem.

What do you plan to do about it?  I doesn't matter what you try it will only work if you have a genuine desire to stop drinking.  Will power will not work, especially if you stay in the same (drinking) environment and hang with the same friends.  I have a family member who attends AA.  He didn't just look into it, but actually applied the program to his life and lived it, that is the only way it will work, but he had to make many lifestyle changes, including his friends - he has been sober for 30 years so I know it can work (one day at a time).  There are many rehab and detox or support programs available, so talk to your doctor and find one that suits you but only if you truly want to stop.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	My father used to have a drinking problem, but he came over it using AA.  And you can't blame your friends for your drinking habit.  Your brain has become addicted to alcohol.  Because you drank it.  Don't blame the people around you that drink.  You gave into the pressure.  Not trying to be mean, but your question sounds to me like you don't want to take full responsibility for your actions.<br>  Just try to drink less and less each time you drink.  You can't just quit like that.  If you drink a little less each time, it slowly gets your brain off alcohol.  Now, I'm not saying you should binge first, just have maybe half a drink less each time you go to a drinking area.|`|iMaYLGECaa	my best friend last year was sent to rehab because he had became an alcoholic...he was only 16 but he still drinks now <br>  he wasnt a pleasant person to be around whatsoever and completly abandoned everyone and he would hook up with random girls all the time to be fair he has changed ever since he came out of rehab but it was really his friends that helped him and he took himself out of situations that he knew would make him start drinking...if i was you i wouldnt go to places where you know you would drink and try and encourage your friends to force you to only have one or two if you are going to drink|`|YyiESOpFaa	he started to realize that he were hurting the people who loved him the most.....his girlfriend broke up with him and that was the start of him changing his ways.<br>  he had to take a class, but i don't think that worked, but i'd advise you to try anyways.<br>  you should also try to surround yourself with people that you know wont drink or will keep you from drinking so much.|`|1BF8UMjRaa	i think u need to find out why ur drinking first...<br>  r u alcoholic, or are u doing it for fun/party/social.<br>  <br>  i personally dont find social drinking a problem at all, but be wary of becoming alcoholic, once u start drinking by urself ITS ALL OVER! ur alcoholic! dont deny it and find pro help.<br>  <br>  long term alcohol consumption makes u look old and ugly. <---maybe that will help haha<br>  or  just bring enough $ for 1 drink when u go to bars.|`|UuGOHHG5aa	yes i do and i dont know what to do . have been drinking 1.5 liter bottle of wine every night for about 4 months . seem to need more and more . i  get palpitations  that make it hard to breathe . so if you find a way to stop share it with me .|`|I0PnftNKaa	i usually go to gym.. that makes me drink water...when i get home.. i eat vegetable... i also avoid to eat animal meat.. now every time i see animal meat at grocery store.. i see the Soul of that animal to entertainment to people... not me|`|2xycmzW5aa	Every alcoholic i have ever known still drinks to this day.

He had a heck of a time stopping, because, being in college, he was surrounded by it all the time.  What he finally had to do was to stop being around those situations as much.  He would find ways to spend time with his friends that didn't always involve drinking.  He would still have the occasional party, but he distanced himself away from the problem enough that he could get a grip on his drinking.<br>  <br>  There are also some good help talk lines around so that you can talk to someone in your times of need.  Good luck!|`|TFYlv3bxaa	My husband use to tell me that I didn't have a drinking problem, that the problem that I had was "not knowing when to say when".  I had so much fun going out (even with him) that one drink would lead, to two, and three, and four, which in turn would lead to staying out later and later.  From your message your live in boyfriend must not go out with you for the "one" drink.  No wonder he is hurt.  What would you be thinking if the tables were turned?  I guess that the biggest part of gettiing older is realizing when "fun" interferes with your normal relationships.  The person asking you our "for just one drink", is that the person that helps you pay the bills, helps you with your daily life?  If not, then you need to look at where your life is.  Your friends will not always be there, but your boyfriend might be, if you let him.  Readjust your priorities.  Fun is fun, but what is fun without the one you love.  Lonliness when you finally realize it.  Hope it's not to late.|`|ivejg4whaa	I have heard a lot of good things about AA. If you are willing to stop completely, they can assist you. But you of course will need to stop going out to bars and such and surrounding yourself with alcohol because if you're an addict then you can't be around that stuff.

KOYC3XkJaa	Run cool water over it for at least 10 minutes, and then until it stops hurting in a burning kind of way. The reason it's still stinging is the residual heat. your skin is still burning. You need to cool it down and get rid of the residual heat, hence the cool water. Do not put it in ice water or put ice on it, because that is too cold and can cause further tissue damage or even frostbite (burned tissue is very fragile).<br>  Once it's cooled down, lightly bandage it with nonstick gauze. Do not put neosporin or any other greasy substance on it for at least 12 hours as oily or greasy things will trap the residual heat and make the burn worse. If you get a product made specifically for burns, or use a cream rather than an ointment (creams are water based, ointments are oil based) then you can use it.<br>  And by all means take some Tylenol. Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Keep it chilled as much as you can,go to the pharmasist and ask if any of the burn creams have something to numb it, when it blisters try hard not to let it pop, get a loose super soft gause and wrap it. the guaze comes really wide and it feels good to have protection on it once it stops burning.|`|AA11839612	Nothing is gonna help pain wise, if it blistered like a water blister, once that pops, get some neosporin and  first aid cream &some gauze pads, it will take 3 to 5 days to heal, ouch i hate burns. the 1st aid cream will cool it down a bit the neosporin will keep infections away, take gauze off when home relaxing or sleeping<br>  <br>  ~bobzero~

5rJ6nf2oaa	Yes it does sound like you may have IBS. Many people limit these episodes or even return to normal from doing a diet based liver and bowel cleanse. This diet was worked up by a doctor, Sandra Cabot, and she has had a lot of success. I do this diet myself every year for 10 years now, and it's the best thing I ever did. <br>  <br>  For 8 weeks try to eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy, processed food and anything containing additives; and of course anything you think is causing you trouble.<br>  <br>  Replace this with fish/seafood (not fried), some lean chicken, lots of vegetables and fruit (raw if you can tolerate it), wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water to flush toxins out. If you can tolerate vegetable juices, raw juice every morning is very cleansing and will speed things up.<br>  <br>  This works, I'm speaking from experience. I hope it helps you. Read the articles below for more explanation and example diet plan. These are free. However for you I think I would recommend that you buy her book (there is nothing in this for me) called the Liver and Bowel Cleansing Diet. It is very good and you will find it a useful guide.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|ZQMjPCDxaa	Talk to your doctor. This could be due to many reasons. Your stomach might just be having reactions with these foods due to an underlying health problem. I seem to see a few consistencies in the foods you mentioned, including spicy foods and dairy products. You might have developed a slight case of lactose intolerance, and many people get an upset stomach after ingesting spicy foods. <br>  <br>  If you need to wait 90 days, I would switch up your diet, sticking with foods you know will give you proper nutrition while also keeping you away from the bathroom. Try things in small amounts. Hopefully that will help. But I would definitely contact a doctor ASAP when you get insurance.

A handful is a good healthy amount.|`|8SRjELNBaa	You just have to remember each one has about 7 calories... but it's got lots of healthy fats.  They're actually very benefitial.

Almonds don't have a lot of bacteria in them that can be harmful, like in meat or eggshells (salmonella does not exist inside the egg, but on the outside of the shell), and so roasting them really doesn't do much other than bring out flavors.<br>  <br>  So yes, eating a lot of raw almonds is bad for you.  Almond = Nut.  Nuts has naturally high fat content.  Which means you won't get sick, you will just get more fat in your body from them, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (fat is the emergency energy reserve of the body).  Just make sure you don't eat a lot of nuts.  Raw or roasted, it doesn't really matter.|`|rJgrwIodaa	That would depend on how well you chew them and whether or not you care about getting fat.  Nuts are good for, almonds and walnuts especially.  They have a high fat content, though, so eating a lot would make you gain weight.  Fortunately, it's the good kind of fat - the kind that actually helps you lose weight, if you eat the right portions.  It's also the fat that your brain likes, making it function much more efficiently than a McDonald's chicken nugget would.

R6IYY4miaa	There's no citrus intolerance, but some people (especially if they don't consume much fruit) have digestive issues with certain fruits. It's fairly common. The more fruit you expose your digestive system to the less problems you will have, but it takes time to get your body accustomed. In the meantime try something like beano before you drink it to settle the stomach.

The health benefit of citrus fruits is vitamin C. You can buy some vitamin C tablets, some are chewable & taste like Oranges.

ePZN6RG3aa	There's no ''best time'' to take the pill. Just it needs to be adapted to your daily routine. <br>  When do you go to bed?<br>  What time do you usually wake up?<br>  Early, like 7am wouldn't be good if you like lie-ins on weekends. <br>  I think it would be best to take it 7pm, in case you want an early night once in a while. <br>  <br>  To the bit about the holiday, I'm sure you would take it as normal, just ask your doctor to be sure though.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	i don't think it matters if you take the pill at a different time each day, as long as you take one during that day. I also use microgynon 30 and have not had any problems doing that. Use a condom if in doubt.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	As long as you take it within 12 hours of your normal time, it will be fine. In terms of holiday, as long as the time difference is only a few hours, you'll be fine continuing to take it at 10pm.|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	Best to take it at roughly the same time, and allow for time difference, take it when it's 10pm at home. <br>  Take your pills out with you so you can take it at 10pm, just excuse yourself and go to the bathroom if you're embarassed about taking it in company. If you can't do that then take it at 12pm. A couple of hours won't make any difference.|`|1BC2rYUXaa	I'm not sure about taking it earlier or later but if you go on holiday you should try to take it at 10pm your time not the country your in.

SkDomhoXaa	that is one of the worst things to say to a bipolar person. especially if they are a bit down or fragile at the time.<br>  bipolar is really hell to live with, never knowing from one day or minite to the next how you feel. <br>  i guess with all your problems youy dont see her's as "real" bad, but for people with bipolar their problems NEVER get resolved, at least yours will one way or another. at least you have a husband, people like me with bipolar find keeping a partner hard.<br>  i think she was right, if we can survive anyone can!!<br>  i think you need to call her, say your sorry and end this silly rift.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Bipolar disorder is hell on earth.  The feelings are so horrible, the anguish so intense, it is like watching everyone in your family being tortured to death, and it is your fault. You feel guilt and remorse over nothing. The feelings are indescribably painful. It is so painful that about 20% of people with bipolar disorder kill themselves. You owe her an apology.  also, about 1/2 of people with bipolar disorder have been seriously sexually or emotionally abused as children, a much higher percentage than the general population. If she has been in the hospital 6 times, then she has severe bipolar disorder that is not responding to medication.<br>  <br>  If you were my friend, I would not see you anymore, because of what you said. You need to apologize sincerely, and do research on bipolar disorder.  It is inexcusable that a close friend would have no idea how severe and painful an illness bipolar disorder is. You were a big ***, and you need to tell her that, and be more understanding in the future. She feels more horrible than you, and for no reason, just because she has a mental illness!  My husband has been thru many hard times, divorce after 29 years, being downsized out of a company after 24 years, and now he is legally blind!  but his feelings and other problems were never as intense as it is for me, because he does not have a mood disorder.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	It is. You don't know what goes on in her head. The constant ups and downs. The feeling like there is something fundamentally wrong with you and nothing really helps. Your brain turning to mush. The knowing that at any moment you can snap and what it does to the people around you. Not fully knowing if what's happening is normal, or if you and your disorder have somehow caused it. Bipolar messes with how your thought process works. Going from a depressed crying mess to an over happy, or sometimes angry person in the blink of an eye for no reason?<br>  Knowing that at any moment you could go right downhill and end up in the hospital again over nothing. <br>  It's a day to day struggle living with bipolar. Money will always come and go, marriages always have their problems, but in the end they resolve one way or another. What you did was shoot down and make like her disorder is nothing. Would you have said something like that if she had AIDS? or was in a wheelchair? <br>  Just because you can't see bipolar, it is a very real, often disabling condition that can take a lifetime to manage. <br>  It's a condition that's hard on everyone, especially her. She lives day in and day out with herself. <br>  Bipolar is a serious problem. You aren't just sounding cold. You are. <br>  Spend some time looking into what bipolar actually does to a person. And apologize.|`|AyeYeS2baa	You really can't talk that way to someone with bipolar disorder<br>  I know your life is no picnic either but being bipolar for her is worse than cancer. Trying to make light of her illness like it was no big deal was a bad move, If she ever speaks to you again consider yourself lucky.|`|paerqxfMaa	Yes, bipolar is hard on the sufferer as well as those around them.

I wouldn't say their life is hard, but their disorder can cause problems in their lives if not treated. It's like being Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde. A total emotional roller coaster. If she's been in the hospital 6 times, someone isn't treating her with the right dosage of medication, Bipolar disorder can be treated, you just have to find the right doctor.|`|xnZi0i8saa	With a little work or maybe just some time your problems will resolve themselves. She is stuck with Bipolar Disorder everyday for the rest of her life. Always and forever. We struggle with it everyday. Even medicated it is a struggle. If she has been hospitalized 6 times in her short life it must be severe indeed. For you to minimize and trivialize her problems when she was trying to be supportive was wrong. She was offering what she thought of as encouragement and you turned on her and took your frustration out on her. I would be upset to. You owe her an apology.|`|LQKW39SEaa	i live with it every day<br>  i now refuse to take medication because i can push through this<br>  i have mood swings like crazy i can be pissed at you one second and love you the next<br>  it's how i am....<br>  i'm not going to take medication just because i feel the need to kill someone or the need to kiss them<br>  <br>  and like your friend said<br>  if i can survive anyone can...i dont know how much her bi-polarness is<br>  but ive tried sucide multiple times...but then i'm happy...mainly because i don't know what i did...my mother wants me back on medicen but i'll push through it|`|2xycmzW5aa	It sucks really bad.   You can't understand unless you have it.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	yes they have hard lives. It is emotionally and physically stressful and can ruin you.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	As far as I can see, you were being a bad friend. She was trying to comfort you and you upset her by being inconsiderate and dismissing her feelings as less "real" than yours. Maybe you were upset she tried to talk about herself and wasn't focusing on just you and your needs? I mean, you really needed to vent and there she goes talking about herself again! And trying to encourage you to survive your problems like she did? What's with that? You don't need her telling you how to survive because after being hospitalized 6 times, what could she possible know about survival anyway? You've got serious issues that need dealing with and her being there for you and being understanding and supportive is just not gonna cut it! Better devalue her as a person by claiming that all of the issues she's been dealing with are so much less serious than yours. I mean, it's not like you were totally insensitive and callous and she felt so upset by your comment she ran off crying... Oh wait...<br>  <br>  As someone who has BD, I could easily say that it's very hard to live with. If you actually bothered to reach out and learn about BD and TRY to understand it, this wouldn't be a question you would have to ask.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	Ok she has been in the hospital 6 times........put ANY other illness in there and say that someone that has been in the hospital 6 times over it doesnt have any problems in their life.  Bipolar can be absolute H*ll to live with.  And the worst is when people tear  you down and say that the h*ll you live in that no one can really see is nothing.  She was trying to give you some support, and you just tore her down.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bipolar is EXTREMES of emotion, that most people never even experience.  Think how you feel with everything you have going on, the stress, confusuion and hopelessness, multiply it by 10 to the point where suicide seams perfectly resonable, you maybe can not even find the modiation to get out of bed, and then, have those emotions be for absolutely no reason....which means there is NOTHING you can work towards fixing, and NOTHING that if things got better you would feel better.  That is what the depression is like that comes with bipolar.  That may have been what landed your friend in the hospital if she was suicidal.<br>  <br>  Now the other end, Mania, can also land someone in the hospital if very severe and out of control.  <br>    However thoughts can get EXTREMELY distorted....mind races.....make bad decisions becausee of distorted thoughts.  Ive destroyed a number of relationships when manic....almost lost my job a couple times.....put my self in debt.   And i am on the milder end when it comes to mania.

Even if hers isn't as bad as some. It prevents some from working or holding a full time job. You wake up every morning not knowing what kind of mood you will be in (high/low/angry/happy). Of course no one knows, but its more extreme with bi-polar. One minute you can be full of energy on top of the world with all of the confidence.. few seconds later you can switch to being extremely depressed, thinking there is no purpose in your life, and no confidence what so ever. It takes a really strong person to overcome bi-polar and be able to control the moods. I suggest looking up the disorder and finding out more info on it. Most people do not understand it and its hard to accept/deal with bi-polar people. It takes a lot of understanding, forgiving. Someone with bi-polar always feels like no one can relate to them or understand them. They don't take comments like "Yeah, because your life is sooo hard" very well. Good luck.. give her some space, look it up so you will have a better understanding of the disorder, in a few days try calling her or even going to visit..apologize and explain you didn't realize how difficult it is to live with bi-polar. She should accept your apology.|`|W2N2WaLZaa	You don't know the things they go through. You were a bit cruel to her, one does not know unless one has been through it.
LzJMaw2Iaa	No.  While leukemia (cancer of the blood) can be detected via blood test and then confirmed with a bone marrow test, any cancer that forms a tumor can only be identified as either benign or malignant by testing the tumor itself.  This is because the doctor needs to look at the specific cells involved to determine whether or not they are cancerous.  If you have a tumor at, say...the base of your skull, the cancerous cells are only in the tumor and not the blood stream.|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Yes, in malignancies of the blood cells (red cells, white cells and platelets.)|`|aCDWwsisaa	No, that would require biopsy.  A blood test might indicate very elevated WBC, but the reason for the high count could be many other things...|`|Q4ggnG0waa	No. They would take a biopsy of tumor tissue or send part of resected tumor for testing. If they'd tested my blood, they would've found nothing. After tumor removal, they had to send some off for testing.
IgztWp0uaa	Yes, HPV can infect your oral mucosa. HPV infection of the mouth and throat has been linked with cancer. So if you all have oral sex, or any skin to skin contact in that area,  you will need to use a barrier like a condom.<br>  go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1619814,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/...</a><br>  <br>  and by the way, this is a good time to mention that you need to practice safe sex with him always, and please consider getting the HPV vaccine asap if you have not already.<br>  As a side note, HPV is a disease that can pass from mother to child if there was a vaginal birthing. He may have gotten it from his mother, or his ex. If he and his ex did not practice safe sex, then she must be notified and will need treatment.|`|grm23kvjaa	HPV is a disease that you can be a carrier of and not get the symptoms and/or you get the warts in the genital area. There is about a nine month gestation period that you will have it and not know it until the warts show.  The warts also can be in the throat if the person has given oral sex and that could lead to throat cancer, or anal cancer if you have sex anally. If you do decide to have sex with him or fool around make him wear a condom- there is always a chance you could still get them even if he wears a condom due to the ceminal fluid seeping from the top if sex is continued after ejaculation.  The HPV is transfered by genital fluids.  If you have already done stuff with him I would go get tested. They would test you by giving you a pap smear to see if the HPV cells are present and are cancerous.  You should also think about getting the Gardisil vaccinations (series of three total) to help prevent the certain types of cancer associated with HPV. (even if you have not done anything with your boyfriend.) Once you get HPV there is no cure for it and there is always a risk of having the certain types associated with cancer.|`|Ks1uiHReaa	Yes, you can get it even if you do not have sex. If u have had oral sex even when he didnt have an outbreak you could have caught it. If your egentails have touched even if there was no intercourse, you could have gotten it. Sometimes is asymptomatic which means you do not see any warts or have any symtoms but can very well test positive for the HPV virus. It is very common 1 in 3 woman have it. GEt a pap smear, and if you are testing neg, get the vaccine assap. hope I helped and be careful!|`|Ii8m3BFfaa	HPV/herpes...can be spread from the genitals to the mouth or mouth to genitals...u can still "fool around" but now when he has break outs you are pretty much going to get herpes if you come in direct contact with the warts...so u can still have sex and oral sex, but use a condom!! Even if he doesn't have the warts you still have a slight chance of getting herpes.  Just be careful and safe and you should be fine, there's no reason to not have a little fun haha!
1BC2rYUXaa	yes, about 10lbs and mainly noticed it on my hips.
08Vk3RtJaa	certainly sounds like her period.  The first few times it can be just a brownish discharge like you describe but will probably become more bloody as her period becomes more regular.

If you try to lose more than the recommended amount of fat per week, your body will turn to and burn its own muscle for energy. The loss of lean muscle mass negates any weight loss you might be trying to accomplish, as muscle is what makes your body healthy, toned and in motion. Having more muscle makes your resting metabolism work harder, which means you burn more calories while you're at rest. Try consumimg at least 1,200 calories a day to prevent the loss of muscle and see if this makes a difference.  remember,smaller meals more often..|`|3meIiIsmaa	6-8 weeks --major changes in 3 months -don't get discouraged -|`|CXwjdUgDaa	It all depends on what you want.

The water thing is still right, as it will show you every time you use the bathroom if you are still bleeding internally.<br>  There is something wrong, and you need to figure it out.  Not going back to the hospital is not a good thing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you, I hope you get well soon.|`|ZQMjPCDxaa	Well if you got punched hard in the stomach it would support the idea that you have a blunt force trauma injury and slight internal bleeding. Did you tell the doctors this? <br>  <br>  You can't just "cure" an internal injury. If nothing showed up on the CAT scan, then just drink a lot of water, and sit back and hope to start healing. But if this continues you should go back to the ER and let them know, because you could end up paying a lot more than a thousand dollars.|`|8gtVRmahaa	The doctors are not mad they know what should be done.If blood is coming from urine then it means that you have less water in your body drink water more at least 8 to 10 Glass every day.And as you know every disease takes time to be cured.So wait for 2 or 3 weeks then see what happens...|`|1dKl1vl0aa	Sounds like you need a good insurance plan, because doctors are the best thing out there to figure out what's going on with your body. Sound like it might be a bladder infection, or a urinary tract infection. Definitely a possibility that it is from getting kicked/punched in your stomach, because it might have caused internal bleeding. I urge you to see them once more.|`|zuZzh4ysaa	Ok, if you got kicked or punched in the stomach you obviously bleeding from somewhere. The only other theory is that you have a severe bladder infection. You need an ultrasound of your bladder & kidney's. Also a bad urinary tract infection can cause urine to be blood tinged. Go to your family doctor or clinic to eliminate the ER bill, they charge a ridiculous fee. Your family doctor can take blood test to see if your CBC (complete blood count) is abnormal. If you are loosing blood somewhere then the CBC will show that your red and white blood cells are out of wack. They can also order urine and blood cultures on you to make sure that everything is normal. I work at a hospital and I do know that the ER's usually only test you for generic illness. You need to ask your doctor for a complete blood panel, to check for everything. Hope this helps....

hPDMDrTqaa	Well I reccomend this workout which is what I started out doing.<br>  <br>  Note: Saturday and Sunday are Rest Days for your body to recover from the weekly workouts.<br>  <br>  First Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push ups, 20 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 20 Lunges, 20 Leg Lifts, 10 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a day. 1/2 Mile Run.<br>  <br>  Second Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push Ups, 30 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 30 Lunges, 25 Leg Lifts, 15 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a Day, 1 Mile Run.<br>  <br>  Third Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push Ups, 40 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 35 Lunges, 30 Leg Lifts, 15 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a Day, 1 1/2 Mile Run.<br>  <br>  Fourth Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push Ups, 45 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 40 Lunges, 35 Leg Lifts, 20 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a Day, 2 Mile Run. (If your not a great runner or you feel you need to decrease the run, you can just run 1 1/2 Mile each week after the initial increase to 1 1/2 Mile)<br>  <br>  Fifth Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push Ups, 50 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 45 Lunges, 40 Leg Lifts, 20 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a Day, 2 1/2 Mile Run.<br>  <br>  Sixth Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push Ups, 50 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 50 Lunges, 45 Leg Lifts, 20 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a Day, 3 Mile Run.<br>  <br>  Seventh Week-<br>  Do Twice a Day (Max Push Ups, 50 Jumping Jacks, Max Crunches, 50 Lunges, 50 Leg Lifts, 20 Eight Count Body Builders)<br>  Do once a Day, 3 Mile Run.<br>  <br>  Then you continue the Seventh week excercise Throughout the rest of the time you wish to lose weight, however this is only part of what you need to do. You'll also need to watch what you eat, I suggest a High Protein Diet, Heres a site that includes some High Protein foods;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/whattoeat/a/highproteinfood.htm" rel="nofollow">http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/whattoe...</a><br>  <br>   I suggest you put together your own high protein diet and find what works for you. Make sure to count calories and watch your daily intake. Be sure not to over-eat due to your increased hunger by the workout, as it will negate the effects.<br>  <br>  Also if you have a Pull up bar or can throw together something to do pull ups on I reccomend doing them Monday - Friday switching between underhand and overhand.<br>  <br>  Example: Monday I'd do my max Pull ups, Say I do 8 underhanded (palms facing towards me). Then I'd try to do 7 underhanded, then 6, then 5, then 4, all the way down to 1. Then Tuesday I do them overhanded (palms facing away from me). I do the max, say I only do 5 this time, then I do 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.<br>  <br>  Also I should Mention that I do Dead Hang Pull Ups, Meaning you start at a dead hang, arms fully extended, and legs crossed if needed so they do not touch the ground, then you go all the way up, chin above the bear, but not touching the ground, then all the way back down to a dead hang, arms fully extended, legs not touching the ground.<br>  <br>  The truth is if your gaining weight while doing this and your sure your eating correctly, your losing fat and gaining muscle and if your losing weight to better your appearence, then your getting the job done.<br>  <br>  Also Note that no Weight Lifting is involved in this workout.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well its good that your actually exercising in the treadmill but to be truly honest my best advice is to start doing aerobics also. A good 30 minutes a day sounds good for the treadmill so keep up the good work also here is a good diet that really helped me lose the weight fast and keep it off.<br>  <br>  8:00 am- breakfast (as many boiled egg whites as you need) <br>  1 wheat toast ( with I cant believe it's not butter)<br>  green tea (the natural one with splenda sugar)<br>  <br>  11:00 am- snack <br>  ( choose from pineapple, grapefruit, or green apple)<br>  <br>  2:00 pm- lunch<br>  ( a salad or something healthy) (easy on the dressing, just use it as a dip)<br>  water or diet green tea<br>  a fruit<br>  5:00 pm- snack<br>  (repeat snack)<br>  <br>  8:00 pm- dinner<br>  ( all bran flakes with skim milk)<br>  <br>  * If you happen to get hungry later just try eating sugar free jello and you should be ok.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Trust me this diet does work, I lost 70 lbs in about 5 months and in two years haven't gained anything. Also if you dont like cardio just try to keep doing abs and working on your muscles to get rid of more fat....good luck.

APFxqV7Haa	Hot flashes are as varied as there are individuals who have them.  They can be as mild as facial flushing much like a hot blush to perspiration running down your forehead and dripping from your nose.  Some hot flashes are so intense that you might have difficulty thinking.  <br>  <br>  The treatment, as with any burning is to cool off.  This can be done by moving to a cool environment or using ice bags; the kind you freeze and put in lunch bags are good.  I use to put them under my arm until the hot went away.<br>  <br>  They can last from a few seconds to several minutes.  Maybe you have nothing to worry about since you were not prone to have them before, you may not have them from this medicine.  I wish you well.  Hot flashes are the pitts.
oz2mOkmyaa	you ought to think about trying what's called Turbulence Training or Interval Training...which is periods of high intensity work followed by periods of rest or low intensity work. combines both a strength component(for lean tissue building) and a cardiovascular component(for fat burning). <br>   <br>  this type of training causes an effect known as EPOC...Excess Post(exercise) Oxygen Consumption. the EPOC phenomenon causes an increased rate of oxygen intake, an elevated consumption of fat for fuel and increases your metabolism up to 48 hours AFTER you exercise! burning fat while you rest!<br>   <br>  Not only does this type of training torch bodyfat, it also saves you time. no more splitting up your days...1 day cardio, 1 day weights...more time for family,friends,work,sports. you also don't need an fancy or expensive equipment to complete these workouts. most of them you can do at home. example:<br>   <br>  squats<br>  push-ups<br>  pull-ups<br>  planks<br>   <br>  do each exercise for a set # of reps or time back to back without rest in-between. that equals 1 set. rest 30-60 sec then repeat whole sequence. do 3-5 complete sets. you can plug in more exercises(I do one where I pick 10 exercises and do 1 min of each) or mix in different exercises. train this way 3x/week and you will definitely see some results.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	How long do you have?<br>  <br>  Exercise and healthy eating are the best ways.  Cut out all sugary and salty foods, and alcohol.  Eat lots of veggies and fruit, lean protein and complex carbs.  Drink lots of water.|`|rwlmu1AYaa	why arn't u impress with the way u look girl u should walk in ur boby feeling proud.

Certain diets are a rip off the best way to loose weight is by exercising and cut down on the fast food.|`|bzv9mLFQaa	I think the quickest way to lose weight is going on a low carb diet - Atkins, South Beach, 'Nerys and India's Idiot-Proof' are examples. <br>  I really don't think they're very good for you! But in an emergency they certainly work, you should lose weight terrifyingly quickly. The only problem is (apart from the unhealthiness in my opinion) that unless you return to normal eating really, really slowly and carefully you will put the weight back on very quickly. I think the Idiot-Proof deals with that pretty well. And the book's quite funny, too.|`|zSK0Q7ioaa	i'm on this diet called smart for life.  it's been about 6 or so weeks and i've lost 11.5 lbs so far.   hope everything works out for you<br>  <br>  here's the website:<br>  www.smartforlife.com|`|aSprkqyraa	get a bigger dress.<br>  or have your current one altered.
AA11193401	yes it is
ePZN6RG3aa	Yeah alot of people get this! They say, you need to take 3packets and if you still feel bad on it then ask your doctor to Switch your pill over. As it wouldn't be right for you. Also, your experience with food, it sound like your on Microgynon, I'm on this too and experienced the same things as you until the start of my 3rd packet; and if you search up reviews into google so many people suffered with this and said it made them loose weight.|`|K70Hkq5haa	You need to go back to your doctor and relate this to him. There are other birth control pills that may not give you these reactions.|`|WDAxZmliaa	when i first started the pill i was a little nauseous too. it passes in a few days and the benefits of the pill far outweigh the negatives. if it doesnt pass in a few days call your doctor. i tried a few different pills before i got the right one. its just your hormones adjusting. you will probably get really moody and stuff too. like i said just give it a few days.|`|UdU7E5MIaa	Many women have this problem.  I can't take traditional birth control pills for this reason.  Not every woman can tolerate them.  Speak to your doctorr.  Some nausea initially is normal, but if it continues that's going to be problematic.
VdTn7Gmbaa	Bless your heart.<br>  <br>  It sounds as though you have replaced one problem with another.<br>  We become dependent on certain people in our lives,<br>  because they bring us happiness, or are great encouragers.<br>  <br>  If you are still depressed over not being able to keep certain relationships with people... and yet, you are as mature as people say you are, well... can you not see the manipulation in that?<br>  <br>  I will say a prayer for you, that you may find a counselor that only God can pick out for you.  One who will listen, and enlighten you on how to become less dependent on others, and who can also help you worry less.   You do need counseling.  May God provide the right one for you.  Blessings are many with God.|`|N70ZEHTyaa	well as for me the best suggestion would go and look for another counselor...   :D
5KbCIEOTaa	This is really up to how fast you pedal your bike. Exercise bikes are good at building speed, however, I suggest you ride a real bike instead (fresh air + social atmosphere).
vJXZgEnOaa	Yes there are different things in both.<br>  Just avoid them.<br>  and you won't have a problem.|`|upwwspFIaa	The answer in short is YES! First of all that crap that your drinking is extremely high in sugar and it sounds like you might have had an adverse reaction to sugar. Before you drink that garbage and after make sure you drink plenty of water. A normal female is supposed to consume 8 to ten glasses of water every day. An if your drinking alcohol you should double it. Your body can react to sugar in the way you explained. You also shouldn't be drinking more than 7 drinks a week. That is the recommended amount for women 21 to 40 years old. If that happens again I would stay away from the HIGH sugar drinks and try a good beer like Stella Artois.|`|ivejg4whaa	There is a lot of sugar in Smirnoff, it probably raised your heart-rate. Smirnoff and things such as Smirnoff ALWAYS give me chest pains. I just avoid them.
t27SvIPbaa	I guess you do not have depression but you have an under active thyroid.  The doctors are very relunctant to diagnose you as havin an under active thyroyd because they can not be sure from a blood test.  So rather than get it wrong they tell people that they don't really have a underactive thyroid but they are depressed.<br>  <br>  DOCTORS DO NOT LISTEN TO THE INDIVIDUALS SYMPTOMS THAT DESCRIBE A LOW ACTIVE THYROID.<br>  iNSTEAD THEY PUT YOU ON DANGEROUS ADICTIVE DEPRESSION TABLETS.<br>  <br>  There are thousands of people like you.<br>  <br>  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE A LOW ACTIVE THYROID ESPECIALLY IF THE DOCTOR GIVES YOU THYROXINE TABLETS.<br>  <br>  Don’t worry you can feel better without that synthetic chemicals.<br>  <br>  First off all if you are in the UK, 99% of doctors do not know how to treat thyroid disease. They only know about Thyroxin which is a synthetic CHEMICAL and should not be in your body. It has many side affects, many don’t feel well on thyroxin as you may well find in a couple of months...weight gain, extreme fatigue, frequent bowel movements, puffy eyes and dry skin, and many others.    <br>  <br>  People with under active thyroid glands who take Synthyroid (thyroxine) should be warned that this drug stimulates osteoclast activity, accelerating bone resorption, and leading to osteoporosis. Natural thyroid medication is available in most countries and is far superior. <br>  Thyroid disease has become epidemic, due to our stressful lives and ill-conceived diets. Soy, in particular, which is used so widely now, suppresses thyroid function and should be banned in all its forms. <br>  <br>  In the long term it leads to osteoporosis. In time you will experience these side affects, so please keep the information that I am about to tell you as you WILL need it. You can treat your thyroid by natural medication with NO side affects. The medication is called Armour Thyroid and is derived from pig’s glands that have a great success rate. They actually used to prescribe it in this country for people with thyroid disease. Yet most doctors don’t even know that, in fact most doctors will not have heard of it and advice you against it while not being able to give you scientific evidence why you shouldn’t! That’s because it’s all about money not health. Their problem with natural products is that nobody can patent them, so the government cannot have exclusive ownership. But they can by making up synthetic chemicals.<br>  <br>  What you need to know is that about 85% of people are unable to transfer T4 into T3 when they use Thyroxin. T3 is essential to the function of the main organs of your body. Armour thyroid naturally has T4, T3 and T2 and T1 and it make you feel well with no side affects. Tyrosine does not have T2 & T1. Once you research it at the site below you can order it from the recommended site -<a href="http://www.internationalpharmacy.com/en/home" rel="nofollow">http://www.internationalpharmacy.com/en/...</a><br>  <br>  I was on Thyroxin for two years and did not feel well on it I had absolutely no energy and my weight ballooned up to 19 and a half stone. I started my Armour in April this year and I am now 15 and a half stone with loads of energy. Armour Thyroid helps increase your metabolism where thyroxin slows it down. As you don’t know me, don’t take my word for your health go to <a href="http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/</a>  Sheila Turner (expert on thyroid disease) runs this thyroid patient advocacy site which will inform and educate you on your disease. There are over six hundred other people on that forum who are taking Armour Thyroid and can give you advice. Pretty soon you will see that doctors know absolutely nothing about treating the thyroid. The are ignorant about it.<br>  <br>  Beware of people on this site who are not what they seem, and will try and discredit amour thyroid at every opportunity.<br>  In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by synthetic levothyroxine (T4), or by combinations of synthetic T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Yes.

Last year through other blood tests the found out I did have an underactive thyroid and in november 08 I started thyroxine pills 25mg per day and I have lost 1st 7lb, I was also diagnosed with the starts of type 2 diabetes. I didn't have any other symptom and my hair and nails and skin were great, my hands are always cold.
