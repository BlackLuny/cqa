mpfqoLCVaa	Outsourcing of  jobs is assigning the local jobs to people in foreign countries where labour is cheaply available. That way, the people in the foreign countries work for a foreign entrepreneur or organization.The Best example of this are the International Call Centres of United States of America. Outcourcing is done to gain cost benefit when for the same job in the home country the cost of hiring local labour is expensive. In times of Recession, it is not advisable to outsource domestic jobs to foreign countries.Outsourcing results in money exiting the local economy when the same could be used to make investments locally so that new jobs could be generated. It is beneficial to the country to whom the jobs are being outsourced because that way new money enters their respective economy.

YzoLa5Uuaa	Repression as a special mechanism (aka Freudian Repression) is a farce. The effect of trauma on memory is a highly controversial topic but most likely the things you have recently recognized were always there but you did not take the time to interpret them. <br>  <br>  There are many aspects of trauma that can cause those memories to not be remembered (or remembered very poorly). This happens in the encoding stage, storage stage, and retrieval stage. Most likely if you can't remember it now, anything you DO remember is going to be at least partially false because of the way the brain reconstructs memories (this does not mean it did not happen, but you are merely recreating the event/s from the minor cues that you have [side note, ALL memories are reconstructed, thus normally very inaccurate]). <br>  <br>  Unless you find memories cues that you did not have before, you will most likely not remember anything else specific, and if you do it will be in the context of encoding specificity (similar mindframe, location, sensory cues, et cetera). <br>  <br>  The childhood memory piece can be related to the age (a great deal of people do not remember anything before the age of 5, and this is very, very normal, and memories beyond that can be hazy at best) that you were, but can also be similar mechanisms as described above. <br>  <br>  I have a extensive knowledge about trauma and memory. If you have any specific questions I can try to answer them (and find the research to back all of my answers up if you desire).|`|4191bf22931e9cc7e405f80b732d50fbaa	Often times when there are traumatic events in ones life, these events are repressed and brought forward later.this sounds the case of you. With a therapist who you are comfortable with,she/he can resolve things that you are uncertain about such as working with the repressed memory by speaking about the snippets that you may have and therapist would help enhance upon them in their given Field.It seems you are concerned and that is a step forward in acknowledgment while also being a frightening experience to learn more of the past events of your life. Readiness as a whole is the key to growth and acknowldgment,which is often difficult, but once the steps are made, you will begin to feel better and cry maybe, within it's acceptance.|`|IjMHcECzaa	Well... I don't know what the memory was but it was only a year ago correct?<br>  <br>   I know it may seem frightening to pull out old memories, but sometimes you just got to let them come back to you...

It is better than having it come back to you when you are unprepared and not expecting it, it can be very damaging and traumatic.<br>  <br>  However dealing with these issues promptly during these critical years of your life, you will thank yourself for it later.

Much of that can depend on genetics.  So look into your family history.  Many elderly people live full, productive lives with their minds fully intact.  There are no pesticides eating away my brain cells. I eat organic whenever I can, eat no prepared foods, and maintain an overall healthy diet.  And I work out regularly with a good cardio and weight training regiment.  I am nearing retirement.  When I reach that age, I plan on continuing working for a few more years.  I'm doing all I can to to keep my mind and body healthy.  Anything beyond that, I have no control over.

e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	I think it is first important that you understand what participant observation is in order to write your paper. Here is a clear explanation. This should assist you in righting the paper. Good luck. Just give it some thought you will figure it out. Perhaps you are over thinking a bit. <br>  <br>  Participant observation is a type of research strategy. Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, or subcultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their natural environment, often though not always over an extended period of time. The method originated in field work of social anthropologists, especially Bronis?aw Malinowski and his students in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the US, and in the urban research of the Chicago School of sociology. It is similar to ethnography but often involves a shorter time in the field<br>  <br>      <br>   Method and practice<br>  <br>  Such research usually involves a range of methods: informal interviews, direct observation, participation in the life of the group, collective discussions, analyses of personal documents produced within the group, self-analysis, and life-histories. Although the method is generally characterized as qualitative research, it can (and often does) include quantitative dimensions. Participant observation is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years. An extended research time period means that the researcher will be able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the people he/she is studying. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like taboo behavior) are more easily observed and understandable over a longer period of time. A strength of observation and interaction over long periods of time is that researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say -- and often believe -- should happen (the formal system) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.|`|LRbxal5Faa	Hm-m-m...

Good luck.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	I'm doing Sociology at A Level.<br>  <br>  Participant observation would involve interacting with the children, so it can influence the childrens behaviour to change what the person is trying to study.<br>  <br>  With participant observation you can see the interactions between a child and an adult and the patterns of play and compare then to that of a child with just children their age.<br>  <br>  The difference in the toys they choose to play with, and the stlye they play in may be effected by the influence of the observer participating.<br>  <br>  Obviously this will be overt observation, so the childs patterns may also be changed by the fact they are being watched and observed to a point.<br>  <br>  Likely to remember a reasonably amount, if you are involved. <br>  <br>  <br>  Suggest that maybe non-participant observation may be a better way of noting their natural behaviour, without the bias influence of a experimenter.

I understand that such dreams cause frustration. <br>  <br>  Reoccurring dreams are very common, nothing to worry, except your dreams are trying to give you some valuable message on yourself. It's trying to tell you to to pay attention to some unresolved matters in your life. <br>  <br>  Our life goes through a phase of destruction and  and rebuilding or death and rebirth. You dream is an indication that you are experiencing this now.  Destruction is just a symbol, it can link to your relationship to others you have ignored or hurt. Or there are some key issues which have captured your feelings and mind, in other words, you are not letting bad feelings to go away. <br>  <br>  Also ask yourself, if you are having some trouble at work or school/college etc? Or is there situation(s) which does not make you feel comfortable etc? <br>  <br>  Basically, it's giving you a warning that just try to relax your mind, try to resolve your unresolved issues, otherwise it could cause you depression(destruction), this is the only way to get rid of your reoccurring dreams. <br>  <br>  Just don't take thing hard on yourself, you are seeing such dreams because it's also an indication that you can control on the situations you are in right now.<br>  Good luck|`|r2gonS44aa	I've noticed that when I am sick, and I am overheating... My dreams will wake me and scare me half to death.<br>  <br>  So throw off the covers when you notice you are too warm.<br>  <br>  And it sounds like a couple things...<br>  <br>  My interpretation of the dream would be:<br>  Some one or some thing, is invading your personal space, and you feel like your abode (a place for just you and you alone) has been some how tarnished or ruined in even the littlest of ways.<br>  <br>  This could be your body, since you are sick.<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  It could be that someone has come in to your physical home and you aren't comfortable with it, which somehow leaks into your sleep process because these things bother you...<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped,  just an opinion..<br>  <br>  XO<br>  A

Suerte y Felíz 2Mil7 Para Todos... "-" ...|`|03def4a401dd615ccdc03b03f7697056aa	La realidad, tiene la maldita manía de superar a la ficción. <br>  Me tocó vivir el terremoto del a?o 85 en la Ciudad de México.<br>  El 19 de septiembre, a las 7,30 de la ma?ana, comenzó a temblar. El terremoto duró dos eternos minutos en los que me dió tiempo a subir al piso de arriba de mi casa, coger a mis hijas, muy peque?as ambas, bajar y salir al jardín. Nos quedamos sin luz, no nos llegaban noticias, y poco a poco fuímos sabiendo por la gente que pasaba por la calle las consecuencias del temblor. Volvió la luz. Estabamos todos absolutamente chocados, no podíamos dar crédito a lo que había ocurrido, como cuando sales de un sue?o y no sabes si ha sido ficción o realidad.<br>  Lo peor, el verdadero pánico para nosotros vino al día siguiente.<br>  El día 20 a las 7,20 de la tarde, la tierra se movió de nuevo. Fué una réplica fortísima al del día anterior. Se comenzaron a oir gritos histéricos en la calle, en las casas aleda?as, se paralizó el tráfico, mucha gente corría sin rumbo, sin destino fijo. Nos vino a todos a la cabeza la situación de las víctimas atrapadas entres los escombros de las ruinas provocadas por el terremoto del día anterior, y el estado de los equipos de rescate que trabajaban como voluntarios para rescatar a los que habían quedado sepultadas. <br>  Ha sido el momento de más pánico de mi vida. No entenderé jamás el porqué yo quede viva, muriendo tanta gente a nuestro alrededor, a corta distancia. <br>  Mi vida fué un antes y un después. Le doy otra importancia a las cosas. Veo que todo es vulnerable, lo primero el ser humano y todas sus obras, por fuertes que parezcan, y eso te hace relativizar muchos aspectos que hasta entonces te parecían inamovibles. También me dió una lección de cómo aprovechar el presente, de cómo no perder el tiempo en infelicidades sin causa, en enfados estúpidos, en frustraciones sin causa real.<br>  No hace falta que te haya pasado nada esotérico ni paranormal para que sientas y veas lo que es el pánico dentro de ti.

r2gonS44aa	I don't think dying your hair is a ritual, but I do know that once women become a certain age... physiologically they change, and they do start to change the way they look in order to seem more attractive to the opposite sex.  <br>  <br>  I don't think you missed out on anything, I think its probably a blessing.  I thank god, I am not married yet. I want to know who I am before I marry someone else and then don't have time to figure out myself.<br>  <br>  You might have changed in other ways that made yourself more attractive to men, but it might not have been the shallow,2 bit kind of change that most women go for... Which means in the long run, you'll end up with a much happier future and more love in your home then a handful of 2 bits... <br>  <br>  I hope I didn't confuse you, although in writing this I've thoroughly confused myself.<br>  <br>  Good luck on the hunt..<br>  <br>  XO<br>  A|`|Gn6Y7X4zaa	so maybe try a different color, duh!!!!!!

If not and you just choose them to start out with...it wasn't a good choice to ignore them.  You should start out ignoring people you meet day to day that randomly judge you.

However now the fed has done all that it can and the economy is still getting worse, so a stimulus is  all that is left to try so we must hope that  the theory is right and that fiscal stimulus works|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Borrowing money and spending it always makes life more good temporarily at least.

And if the debts become too large, then sometimes they cannot be paid off.<br>  <br>  Which means that the stimulus bill might help in the near future but then make life more difficult later on.<br>  <br>  Too much private debt is what got the economy into so much trouble now.  And having the government run up huge debts too might make things even worse later on.|`|XyN99Pizaa	its a good thing in theory but its got to be paid back sometime...when is sometime...and who has to pay it back our childrens children...who knows if it will work or not...just lets hope that it does or we might be heading towards another great depression like we saw in the 30's!!!

YwE5kIB8aa	I had some feminist answer my question about oppression and start whining about discrimination which had nothing to do with the question.  And her response was quite aggressive and arrogant.  I gave her 10 pts and put her in her place, and I think she reported it.  Whiner.|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Well, if you want to know why feminists do something, then you should ask them, not non-feminists!|`|dH9IhDIFaa	The simplest recourse for any ideologue to evade questions damaging to their ideology is to ask questions that erode the credibility of the original poser of the question.<br>  <br>  This is not a phenomena specific to feminists.  The same is true for anyone that has subscribed to an ideological mantra.  It could be applied to religious fanatics, hard right and hard left politicians, misogynists, and a host of other ideologues.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	It is very simple actually...they answer with questions because they can't back up their arguments in this day and age with facts so they use questions as a distractionary technique...it really is that simple. Even NOW's website argues one point and then links to statistics that state the exact opposite...you should know though...the feminists do not want to officially "win" their side of the issue (even though they did long ago), because it would negate the justification of their existance and you can bet they want to ride that gravy train all the way to male subservience.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Umm... I don't think she's one of your "feminists" by definition on this answer forum anyway.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	So now you're judge of what's appropriate here? (<-------------- Yes, I did it, so shoot me). <br>  <br>  Are "questions" that are nothing more than self serving rants and soap-box tirades "appropriate?" Are questions that serve no purpose other than to whine about some perceived personal persecution appropriate? Questions such as (paraphrasing) "Why are *my* questions reported?" "Why did this person (or group of people) answer my question in this manner?" "Why did this person insult me like this?"....you know, the kind of questions YOU ask all the time. So why is it OK for you to use this forum inappropriately, but not others? THAT sounds like a superiority complex...thinking it's OK for you while you criticize others.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like the Socratic method. I use it in "real life," and here, as a way to draw out a persons ideas, get them  to explain the REASONING behind their opinions. And my use of the Socratic method is no more inappropriate for this forum than your rants and "why me?" questions. You may dislike my approach, but I won't be changing it anytime soon.|`|FUIBscKGaa	The link you gave demonstrates that the poster you refer to, like me, does it when the question asked seems to have an obvious answer.  That's how she saw that one, and that isn't surprising.  I too, am a feminist, and answered differently.  The link I'm providing is to a question where the asker was asking something so obvious.  I then went back and answered directly.  You will see that my answer conveys the exact same thing as if I had directly commented.  <br>  <br>  It's really not a phenomenon, as you said, according to the definition of phenomenon.  You are just some weirdo who can't articulate what he thinks, so you attempt to discredit the most trivial crap.  If this is "evidence" that  feminism is a supremacy group, it is no better than any other "evidence" that you freaks have attempted to manufacture.  What sad, pathetic, week little arguments you have.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuIH6YqvyizuJqkG4xSnY6_ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221210615AAxFa3o&show=7#profile-info-fDGPbwdsaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|uhchod38aa	I would find it easier to answer this question if I knew which feminist you are referring to. If you are referring to me, all I did was ask him, in the course of my answer, if he was serious as I found that question to be completely outrageous.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you are referring to the first answer, she brought up an excellent point by asking that question. Perhaps you just missed it.<br>  <br>  Edit #2: Thank you for the clarification and now that you have made it, I see where you referred to it in the initial question. Oops, silly me. I suppose she could have phrased her answer not in the form of a question...really, I don't see why it matters. Many people ask questions in their answers, irregardless of their views concerning feminism.<br>  <br>  I'll bet money the answer below me gets best answer.

We wouldn't need armies, politice, or politics if there were no men!|`|6dec34d9b638219a95eb834d1471a984aa	In the police: Since most criminals are male, esp. violent offenders, we wouldn't really need policing as much if we got rid of the men. Getting rid of the men, would get rid of the majority of criminals. Furthermore physical strength of gender wouldn't be an issue if we're all the same gender.<br>  <br>  In the Army: Again, in a man-less world....we'd be fighting women, if we'd be fighting at all. Surely there'd be some war but, not near as much, and not nearly as big. <br>  <br>  In politics: Women all the way, in a world w/ or w/o men. I'd like a politician who told the truth for a f#cking change, had more intelligence than arrogence, and actually cared about making a difference rather than getting their bragging rights & using their political prestiege as a status symbol....<br>  <br>  In science: Women. I heard women in this country were surpassing men in math & science now. Finally.<br>  <br>  In sport etc: We can eliminate that all together. What good do professional athletes do? Not really a need, and I know I personally, alongside many other women aren't entertained by them. If ppl wanna play games, that's fine but, they shouldn't get payed for it, unless the makes of the balls, chess boards, whatever the game, wanna sponser them as advertisments for their products. *LOL* And good luck w/ that w/ no men...Hahaha<br>  <br>  Psychologist: Women. While I'm sure ppl would be less $crewed up, ppl aren't perfect, and we still might need them around to strive for that ever elusive perfection..<br>  <br>  CEO's: All a housewife is is a CEO of a small company...only, she does more work. She manages everything, making sure everything gets done at a certain time, dinner, school, ect., makes sure the kids/employees do their part, multi-tasking everything at one time. Studies have proven some of our differeances (ppl skills, multi-tasking...) work to our advantage bigtime when managing ppl in corperations b/c happy employees work harder, and have more loyalty towards the company. Being a CEO takes alot of responsability, and women generally take on more than their share anyways, while men avioid it as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Secritary/Waitress/Assistant/other jobs that involve memory & multi-tasking: Women, of course. Again, we're proven to be better at multi-tasking in many diff. test.<br>  <br>  Actresses: It relates to pyschology. Besides, have you ever known many good male actors? I'm not talking the one in action films were they have very little plot, or character. I'm talking about men who express their emotions well, and are believable & who really make the film, actors who play parts not everyone can play. I'm talking about actors who made the film great, almost as much as the writter & director did. Throughout history, even in oppresseive times for women, it's actresses like Marlyn Monroe, Angelina Jolie, and other women who became famous icons...not just for their sexiness, though that plays a part but, b/c they are interesting, and they can truely act. W/ the exception of Johnny Depp, & Leonardo DeCaprio, I can't say I know of any real captivating actors. I can name quite a few women but, not many men, even though most parts are played by men so the odds are in favor of them. They're just kind of there, and they're not very expressive on average (like statues), and hey show very little range in general. There are famous actors, who were lucky enough to be in a well written movie but, not many good actors (w/ the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is great). Same goes for singers. Although more men are better at singing than they are in films, the real greats are mostly women. <br>  <br>  Anything in the Arts: Have you noticed all the arts are steriotypically often done by very enfeminate gay men (fashon, hair, interior design, painting, sculpture, ect.)? Yeah.... I think a real women would be better.<br>  <br>  Philosophers: A womens brain never shuts up. She thinks about many things. A man's is off most of the time. A usually man thinks mostly about cars, sports, and women, and not much else. Deep things annoy a man, and so do questions about what he's thinking. <br>  <br>  Doctors, Dentist, and the Alike: Women. Personally, I think a patiant caring & percise hand is a good hand during any opperation. I don't want someone looking at me as another number, or getting in to much of a hurry when my life is at stake.|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	How could you have one without the other? What made you come up with such a question, which do we need more... What do you need more, water or air? Are you in college studying so-called "critical thinking"? Is this some higher learning going on here?|`|c6g92RRVaa	In the Army - both<br>  In the police - both<br>  In politics - both<br>  In science - both<br>  In sport etc - both<br>  I don't think either gender is more or less capable of these occupations. each sex has their positives and skills!|`|K4zsztkRaa	In the Army- I don't care.<br>  In the police- don't care.<br>  In politics- men<br>  In science- don't care<br>  In sports- men<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|NYU37jfGaa	In the army, definitely men, likewise in the police.   Probably in science too.  I don't know about politics, and I don't care about sport.<br>  <br>  In teaching, nursing, childcare, the social services, care of the elderly etc, we could definitely dispense with men more easily.  Possibly in medicine too, since I understand there are more women doctors than male nowadays.  That's a tricky one.
Ic2RXP1Haa	I think it can happen, and I think hormones have nothing to do with it. Rather, upbringing and cultural background would affect such ages. For example, being a young child growing up in war, one would be mature in the sense that he would know the survival aspect of life. In addition, he would be aware that death could come anytime, and that life is something he would be lucky to keep for himself.<br>  <br>  In contrast, a child born into luxury may well be 25 years old but still thinks like a 12 year old. Supposing he was too pampered as a child, he might never learn the realities of life outside his ivory tower. He may never have the skills required to stand on his own feet and work for his own supper.|`|tCOrcOK0aa	sure, nobody need to think this and can give u the answer, sure|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Well it's always possible that some 12 year olds can be mature for their age and smart and most 12 year olds want to form a friendship with some other teenagers.. and they may even be interested in sex.. but at age `12 however mature they may feel 12 years old is not an age when anyone should have sexual intercourse.. Definitely that is way too young and if they are smart they will wait.. they are physically only just changing from boy to man.. and only just starting the long process of adolescense.. same as girls.. so it's not just mental it's physical as well.. a desire to find out what physical intimacy is like may exist .. but at 12 years old I definitely say.. that is way too young.. One can be friends with a boy at age 12 but just friends.. opposite sexes can be pals.. at that age and even hold hands but no sex involved... They don't know about everything they need to know about how to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies and other things.. they have many years ahead of them to explore their sexuality..one can find smart and intelligent teenagers or people of all age groups and some 12 year olds may be mature for their age. <br>  <br>  Most 24 year olds want to have a relationship with someone.. and smartness has nothing to do with age. When we get older we gain life experience.. so a 24 year old has life experience compared to a 12 year old.. which makes sense.. they have been around on this planet 12 years longer and been through puberty and in a job.. or to uni.. so life experience is definitely there which a 12 year old can't have.. as to smartness and intelligence.. not every 24 year old has that.. and some don't act very mature.. so that has nothing to do with age itself but also with the way how they were raised and what kind of friends they hung out with.. if they get into bad company and start binge drinking and doing drugs.. then they don't set a good example for anyone.. <br>  <br>  The sexual thing.. sexual curiosity is definitely there in a lot of 12 year olds but that's where it should remain .. a platonic friendship with someone of the opposite sex is fine.. but not an intimate sexual relationship...x|`|Y4motN5saa	Yes, from the age of 11 I was told I acted much more mature, responsible and compassionate than people much older than me.
JWjq5iaXaa	yes I do. <br>  <br>  haha, lol.|`|AA12059817	What would you rather them use? You do know what common sense is don't you?..(logic)|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Well how can common sense be a joke... ? Personally in the psychology section jokes have no place.. for that one should go to ''Etiquette or to Polls.. they are full of questions that are waiting for a funny answer.. Psychology questions in my case when I answer them.. I don't look for being right or wrong.. I am trying to answer a question where someone is asking for advice.. and I answer it to the best of my ability.. either from my own experience or I try to put myself in the other persons place and say.. I guess if this happened to me.. I would do such and such.. that doesn't mean others have to follow my advice but I don't joke and if it's a matter of giving advice or if my opinion is asked.. I can't be wrong.. someone may not agree with my opinion, then they won't choose my answer as best answer.. but an opinion can never be wrong..and common sense is needed a bit..and one can only be wrong about facts.. and for facts I go to google and google them.. if I ask questions on Yahoo answers I also do it to get other peoples advice or their opinion.. for general knowledge questions that I can look up at google.. I rely on google..and I like jokes but only where they are appropriate.. not when someone has a problem...|`|6kUx7fwcaa	"Common sense" is not common any more, it is extraordinary.|`|BUvvstsjaa	Common sense doesn't come naturally, it has to be taught.|`|9qiLZp50aa	Yeah it's like they're implying that you lack common sense.|`|7En0G0oqaa	yes a lot i don't know why they use but it is really very horrible..........
r2gonS44aa	What this person means is,  YOUR SPELLING IS HORRIBLE, Are you using Ebonics or something.<br>  <br>  Type like someone who has something to ask, not someone who wants to show us all through their writing how "cool" they really are, because they can't spell and have no grammer.<br>  <br>  Ahem, sorry about the rant.<br>  <br>  To start over.  No, you aren't crazy.  I would assume by all safe reasoning that you are perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  A couple things, get up and do something.  This will lessen this reaction you have , when you HAVE to do something.<br>  <br>  You have a complete lack of motivation.<br>  <br>  The majority of where you are coming from, is anger and resentment. <br>  Everyone is going to tell you to consider counseling- But thats an easy answer.  (although you should consider it, check with a highschool counselor or the Lutheran Social Society (or whatever they are called) and set up an appointment)<br>  <br>  secondly, get out of the house. and find something productive to do.  Go to a Museum, or an Art showing, Paint a pic, read a book. Just don't sit in front of the TV with nothing to do.  If you do nothing it will only make all these feelings worse.<br>  <br>  And please for the sake of all things holy, learn to type, spell and speak properly.|`|Gn6Y7X4zaa	you should probably go to school.|`|AA12059817	Your a typical kid these days..you don't like to take orders, and have no respect for anyone. As for the violent urges..is it just for your brother, or for others too?
HFZbmcdBaa	This isn't my story but is my mums. <br>  <br>  She was somewhere in her 20's and went out for a party and decided not to lock her doors since she lived sort of in a safe neighborhood. A few hours past and she came home and went to bed.<br>  <br>  It must have been maybe an hour later before she woke up suddenly. She had heard a noise( God must have been with her that moment because she is not a light sleeper). She was half asleep and saw a figure a few yards away from her bed. She thought it was probably her dad or someone and whispered "dad?" <br>  <br>  My mum sat up in bed and the figure approached her with a ski mask on. My mum suddenly did what her mind told her too do. She screamed as hard as she did. It was a annoying scream and she was rocking back and forth at the same time. The man smacked her and told her to shut up, but she didn't. Finally he got scared and ran off. My mum got up and chased him toward the door, but he must have praticed how to run out of the house fast enough because he got out faster than my mum did.<br>  <br>  For monthes my mum slept with a nightlight and today she still screams when you wake her up from her sleep.|`|74KTBPb4aa	someone i thought was my BFF choked me for about  2 minutes i was so scared!!! please awnser my new question!!!!!!!!!|`|ST19Eq3baa	When I dreamt that there were ghosts in our house!
iepLmpvRaa	Sociology is quite simply a way of studying ppl.Sociologists want 2 know y ppl behave the way they do why they form groups why they go 2 war why they worship ,marry ,vote all such things that happen when ppl interact with 1 another.<br>  <br>  "Thus sociology can be defined as the scientific study of social relations,institutions n ppl.<br>  <br>  According to Hobhouse, sociology studies - interaction of human minds.<br>  According to Park  Burgess sociology is the `science of collective behavior`<br>  According to Emile Durkheim `sociology is a study of social phenomena`|`|HlfBL74jaa	In my opinion. Sociology is the study of human interactions and behaviour towards eachother in society.<br>  i mean its obvious the word "social" or the term "socialise" are epitomes of the term sociology <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't mind me asking but whats with the name "minion of satan" would't you say its vage|`|yT295TT2aa	from what i was told is that it is a church that the people don't believe  in doctors that if someone is sick or hurt they all gather around and pray  tom Cruise is one and so is john travolta i myself don't believe that way   i think it not a good thing something i would not do i do believe in God but if your hurt go to the doctor i saw john travolta on a show  he said when he wife was in labor she could not have any medicine or make any noise or she would be kicked out of the church  to me its dumb|`|QAtpLEEFaa	These three questions,  according to  CW Mills,  are the basis of the sociological approach:<br>  <br>  (1) What is the structure of this particular society as a whole? What are its essential components, and how are they related to one another? How does it differ from other varieties of social order? Within it, what is the meaning of any particular feature for its continuance and for its change?  <br>  (2) Where does this society stand in human history? What are the mechanics by which it is changing? What is its place within and its meaning for the development of humanity as a whole? How does any particular feature we are examining affect, and how is it affected by, the historical period in which it moves? And this period-what are its essential features? How does it differ from other periods? What are its characteristic ways of history-making?   <br>  (3) What varieties of men and women now prevail in this society and in this period? And what varieties are coming to prevail? In what ways are they selected and formed, liberated and repressed, made sensitive and blunted? What kinds of 'human nature' are revealed in the conduct and character we observe in this society in this period? And what is the meaning for 'human nature' of each and every feature of the society we are examining?|`|LSKeLOIGaa	Its the study of human social behavior, especially the study of the origins, organization, institutions, and development of human society.
fea1153448e7bdd8eae24575e295883daa	First the Mayan calendar does not end on that date, it resets and starts over, their calendars run in cycles and that date will be the end of a cycle for their long count.<br>  <br>  Next, if extra terrestrials lived among us for a time we would have archaeological proof of this, something would be left behind.  Also, why would they only stay with us for a short period of time then leave and never return or make themselves known?<br>  <br>  Its not likely Mayan Gods were extra terrestrials.|`|QJ5Lh3wUaa	They also could have been time travellers<br>  <br>  Or they could have been envoys for a human technological civilization that lived in Earth's past, but for which all records have been lost<br>  <br>  Or they could have been.... (I could go on).<br>  <br>  None of these things are impossible, but (a) are they likely, and (b) is there any evidence in support of them?<br>  <br>  If aliens were going to attack on this date, why warn the Mayans?  Are where are the aliens' artifacts?|`|Di7zRKEIaa	Who knows...<a href="http://sarsen56.wordpress.com/solve-this/ufos-aliens-and-gold-memory-devices-entertaining/" rel="nofollow">http://sarsen56.wordpress.com/solve-this...</a>|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Anything is possible although they seem more demonic to me.|`|VxDITnZYaa	this is a topic that i love to hear about. i like hearing about maya and extra terrestrials because it is a riveting concept. I do think about this as true because in the mayan paintings, don't the mayan people look like extra terrestrials? Plus, there are many different theories about the end of the world and many different months that everyone says it will end like the theory about a giant meteor crashing to the earth on august 18, 2012. however my own personal theory is that the mayan calendar ends on the right day but either it will be a war or weather conditions that kill us.|`|IRGPKLMBaa	Its left as a question mark, to the scientific world and therefore everyone specultes as to what when and where these people got there ideas from and how exactly they buitl the things they did. Being that we live in a ever expanding universe i think it is possible that there are ets out there somewhere but whether or not they helped the ancient people along is doubted bring that many ancient people were superstition and scared of many unexplored and uninvestigated things back then, so they developed gods and many other things to substitute fir what they didnt know about, like the sun god, that we know is just a star but the thought they could appease it by sacrificing people and taking out there hearts. so i doubt it|`|5dTqcpMzaa	I think it's pointless to think about unless you're making an attempt at fiction. Also, doesn't believing in extra terrestrials contradict the bible? Genesis seems fairly clear about what God created.|`|HKtxjWV1aa	Any gods or goddesses could have been ET. I don't know about the Mayans, interesting theory though.|`|AA10505866	I can't think of any evidence to support that notion. 2012 is the end of a Cycle of the Maya calendar. Their calendar doesn't "end" then. If they were still around, I imagine they'd be planning out the next cycle that begins in 2012. I'm not sure how any of this makes them aliens, or connects them to aliens. Lots of people predict the end of the world. Many of them attach dates to those predictions. Are they all aliens, too?<br>  <br>  Additionally, does the beginning of the Maya calendar coincide with the beginning of the world? No?|`|BMxNOJ39aa	Why could the ET have created man. That's one of the tenets of "intelligent design" (an oxymoron if there ever was one) Tha there was some "designer."<br>  <br>  You make some sweeping assumptions to get to your question. Consider<br>  "Mayan calender ending at Dec 21, 2012." That's not correct.<br>  <br>  The Mayan calendar date of "Dec. 21, 2012," is only when the  "Long Count" calendar marks the end of a 5,126-year era. Not and end.<br>  <br>  One problem is calculating this date to our calendar. An excerpt from some discussion runs: "in which the Venus Round is cut short after 61 Venus cycles to locate a new 1 Ahau Sacred Day of Venus near an actual Venus morningstar appearance, is probably only one of many conceived by the Maya...potent Venus Round of 37,960 days...dichotomy between Lounsbury's work and Thompson's, ... correlation question...Thompson correlation of 1930 (corr# 584285), while Thompson himself revised it 2 days in 1950 (corr# 584283).<br>  <a href="http://www.alignment2012.com/fap9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alignment2012.com/fap9.html</a><br>  <br>  So what will happen on this date (or has already happened, or may happen some indefinite time before or afterwards?) We have a 7 year math error in our calendar so it's really 2016.Also I've seen dates from the 12th to the 31st of December.<br>  <br>  "Lawrence Joseph forecasts widespread catastrophe in Apocalypse 2012: A Scientific Investigation Into Civilization's End. Spiritual healer Andrew Smith predicts a restoration of a "true balance between Divine Feminine and Masculine" in The Revolution of 2012: Vol. 1, The Preparation.

To render Dec. 21, 2012, as a doomsday or moment of cosmic shifting, she says, is "a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."<br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200..." rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200...</a><br>  <br>  As for disasters, a review of the last 40 years has these books and events predicting disaster:<br>  1968 "Population Bomb". Too many people in the 1980s and starvation.<br>  "Famine 1975" In that year we run out of food<br>  "Greening of America" We all become hippies eating un-homogenized peanut butter.<br>  "Future Shock" We'll have too many choices.

The question was"Is it 2000 or 2001?" <br>  <br>  If you get the impression, there's a lot of disaster predictions and they sell books, you're right.<br>  <br>  During the 1800s there were a number of movements that predicted the end of the world. People gave away everything they owned and gathered to await the end. A couple of days later, they started trying to get their stuff back.<br>  <br>  Now about aliens. First, they could have visited earth but found no life. They could have come and not found man. They could have come, found man but he was too primitive. The plant is 4,500,000,000 years old. We've been around a modern humans for less the 200,000 years.<br>  <br>  Aliens, to get to earth have to deal with the laws of physics. Eistienian math shows that the faster you go the greater the mass and the more power you need. At that rate you can never match the speed of light.Getting here from another star would be enormous in consumption of fuel, resources and time.<br>  <br>  As for "earlier humans" I'm still waiting for a beer can from Atlantis. An advanced culture that left no trace?

AA12231462	I was in the same boat in my forties - I bought lots of self help books that were not much use but I got a sort of addiction to them trying to find my story in the pages - I went to counselling  for a long time  and did a lot of crying and one day I realised my life was all about me anyway and not about what they did to me and I was free to be however I wanted to be and not be a victim. It wasnt a short process but I realised that I had been grieving all that time for myself - My lost childhood.<br>  <br>  Trust the process your mind and body know what to do and are doing it.<br>  i did find counseling helped and my parents deaths also helped because it freed me up to love them knowing that they couldn't pull any more strings in me.|`|5dTqcpMzaa	Don't let baggage hold you down.

Sometimes unbalanced people execute more than one "murder" before they are apprehended ! As for the real murders, they also happen off course !

h9WTyjOoaa	Hello and I am sorry to hear this. I myself have suffered from depression my entire life and have had the same thoughts as well as suicidal idiosyncracies<not sure i spelled that right> basicly it means I do things constantly that could result in my death if I make a mistake like driving 150 mph down a dark road with sharp curves to see whether or not I would fly off the road.  <br>  <br>  Anyways the fact is almost everybody has thoughts of death for one reason or another, in some people it is more pronounced.  This is of course do to many reasons. My favored logic behind these thoughts borderlines into metaphysical sciences.  I have a friend who suffers from depression and self inflicted harm and certain thoughts. She once I asked me why she is depressed and so in an effort to help you understand I will tell you what i told her.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons for depression the most obvious and easiest to locate is chemical imbalances within the body.  These imbalances can manifest many different reactions and be triggered at different times by a variety of things. For example being exposed to a situation of high stress can increase cortisol production in the body and decrease seratonin production which if maintained long enough can become a habitual imbalance.  This usually leads to excess eating and storage of fat along the mid ring and can be treated partially by a product I have used myself called Cortisol Hunger control made by omnipharmacueticals<not sure i spelled that right if interested email me at my buissiness email thearcanehaven@hotmail.com and I will find a place where ya can get it> .  Furthermore there are reactions of photons in regards to the physical body. It has been found that various frequencies of light can affect the body as well, the most calming frequency is found in the color vbrations of blue.  This frequency if exposed too often and common can induce depression.  Brighter colors such as red and orange and yellow even are good counteragents to this fact. However every frequency has ups and downs to understand this a good book to read is how to heal with colors by ted andrews as he takes a metaphysical and scientific approach to photonic therapy and the effect of light on the body.  <br>  <br>  Delving as little more off topic from scientific to as is common in mainstream science to metaphysics and xeno physics, it is commonly known and accepted that past life experiences can pervade the body via the spirit.  These experiences are called Soul scars, there are many types of scars and these scars can be benficial and detrimental. This is commonly seen in irrational phobias.  more often than not a person who undergoes past life regression therapy finds that the logic behind thier phobias has to do with events in past life, such as death by a blade can render a person terrified of blades in this life.  Vice versa such a death could also lead a person to become obssessively fascinated by blades.  Depresssion can also be caused by such scars such as scars of losing someone, or scars of abuse on you in such previous life.  This undealt with scarring can pervade you here and now and cause you to respond to different things in different ways.<br>  <br>  Another reason for suicidal thoughts or obsession with death is for the same reason, someone who died unhappily in a past life or who was surrounded by death can develop a dread fascination with death and have thoughts and images of death pervade thier minds.<br>  <br>  There is also the possibility of scars in the current life that are fresher and easier treated that can leave you wounded and drawn towards such things.<br>  <br>  Depression and suicidal thoughts are not nessecarily a bad thing nor a childish or immature thing.  They are common place and occur for a wide variety of reasons.  What really matters in the end is not the thoughts but the actions, Such as if you actually try to commit suicide or kill someone.  However depsite the commonality of these things they are an imbalance in one form or another when they become so common as be something of concern to yourself.<br>  <br>  By asking for help you have taken the first step towards healing yourself.  <br>  <br>  I may be able to help and if you want to speak to me directly email me at the above listed email or add my MSN messenger name of Darkvalorx@hotmail.com and seek me out.<br>  <br>  For direct recommendations of treatments:<br>  <br>  Energetic Release Therapy<br>  Quantum Energy Therapy<br>  Past Life Regression Therapy<br>  Past Experience Regression Therapy<deals with memories you selaed away to forget about that induce trauma><br>  Reiki Energy Healing<br>  Chakra Balancing<br>  Jungian and Freudian Psychology<there is a current practice of psychology that delves away from these two schools of thought, this newer more modern school of thought deals more with the chemical imbalances as a result of the spiritual and mental, hence treating the symptoms and not the cause, While Freudian and Jungian psychology schools of thought deal with the deepest issues the very roo|`|l2qnuSKjaa	ask ur self why. try to understand everything ur thinkin about. and i highly suggest to talk to someone if u dont want to kill urself. talk to a counselor or a friend. pick a friend that u think cares about u the most. even if its not alot. pick one. and tell them these things. if u can handle responses from strangers like me than u can handle them from these friends of urs.|`|tU2n5iFBaa	you need someone to talk to, i would suggest going to a doctor but if your uncomfortable with that there are support groups. and i know i am a complete stranger but im here, and im a good listener. <br>  <br>  your thoughts of people you love dying is a fear of death the only way to make it stop is to overcome your fear.|`|OLOzGXUZaa	talk to a psychiatrist. one that speacialises in suicide. or call <br>  1-800-suicide

So it doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  But if I catch your drift, we definately have done so.  We need our fancy houses and clothes, our extra-pure food and water and our technology to survive.  We can no longer function like wild animals, finding our own resources and hunting our food with simple weapons or none at all.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	from the caveman to today society...depending on your definition of domesticated...................but through the ages human needs included a  need for food, shelter, clothing, that did not change...the rest is just civilization meeting their needs and greeds according to todays standards
906a6ae6f41dff1d6d4759c7c004ce4aaa	Hi Antonios Mom,<br>  <br>  Let's see what you have there....<br>  <br>  I'll dream that there will be 50 tornados ripping through my town and Im trying to find shelter, but Im not always scared. Sometimes I can tell myself in my dream "this is a dream".<br>  <br>  <br>  **Okay, so we don't have a "story" to go by.... But, we do have the basic symbolism... "tornado".... This particular "disaster" as you call it "natural" often denotes that an outside issue will be or is effecting our lives in a natural kind of way disruptive of the current situations we face.... Often an "onset" or "coming" as we usually see them from the distance in an approaching, towards us, manner.<br>  <br>  Should simply say, "something is coming".. disruptive of your circumstances.... Be prepared if you see it coming, or be aware if it is currently near.....<br>  <br>  I also have dreams of Tsunamis, <br>  <br>  **Because Tsunamis are associated with water and water often denotes spiritual or emotional turmoil.  Here is a disruptive source that effects the emotions.... As it is an outside source (Occurring outside the self: outside), it will be or has been some issue that will effect ones feelings...... coming from some other place.. not from self... or self inflicted... Alot of the times, this symbolic disruption may also indicate emotional issues effecting the dreamer and sometimes health related.....<br>  <br>  I have seen this issue effect the body in the "toss and turn" fashion, dependant upon whether the dreamer is currently "in the water".... watch for that too....<br>  <br>  and fires breaking out every where.<br>  <br>  **Fires are indicative of serious disruption... breaking out everywhere are various and multiple issues to which the dreamer will struggle to eliminate on the basis that they should be cautious.....<br>  <br>  In my dreams im usually trying to take pictures, <br>  <br>  **Pictures are impressions displayed to the mind for memory sake....<br>  <br>  of the tornados, <br>  <br>  (Of the pictures) to be a reminder of.... this issue... often approaching, or just passing by....  Pay attention to what, if anything, gets destroyed in the aftermath...<br>  <br>  or of something that is so AMAZING and beautiful, but I can never get the picture in time, <br>  <br>  **Dream says you cannot remember enough about the situation or you are unable to recall the issue to which it relates....<br>  <br>  or my camera wont work for some reason.<br>  <br>  **suffer from short term memory loss?... The camera is the mind's eye... the eye itself will capture the photo because it must have a focal point... the camera is the mind the eye is its lens....<br>  <br>  Im really into photography, so this usually really upsets me when I cant get the pic I want!<br>  <br>  Certainly.... Perhaps it is no more than your need to take the perfect shot and frustrations prove to your point of view that it is actually a difficult task to perform.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your sister,<br>  Ginger,<br>  ((Dream interpreter for over 20 years))|`|E23s2wSNaa	lol nice<br>  <br>  i actually remember having a dream about a tornado, it was very scary, and jeez i wouldnt be taking pictures of it|`|87af67fae00282c9a730a508a8a5b528aa	you tell the reason. You are a person born for photography. Naturally, at the early stages of an armature photographer, he would think of some exotic photographs coming out of him and getting immediate attention from all over the world and becoming a celebrity. There could be such photographs of celebrities in your mind who became famous after their much acclaimed snaps. Tornado and Tsunami hit areas and beautiful landscapes are the right places to get a real enthralling shot of a frame that could catch attention. <br>  <br>  Since you react in your dreams positively, I think your dreams are going to make you a wonderful photographer.|`|Eh3YVc6Aaa	This is really easy.  I am in my dream and I think of some funny quote or something that sounds nice.  So I start talking it into my voice recorder.  But for some reason I can't get it to work.  This happened in my dream for about a year.  Then one time I woke up from my dream just thinking that and realized if I recorded something in real life, I usually listen for the playback.  But since I am in dream state, your photography isn't something you can look at.  You in your dream can't look at something of the same as your dream.  So now when I am dreaming, some things I do in real life but for some absurd reason can't do in my dream, I realize ohh...
KwNpyp3saa	I am glad you realize your schedule is very busy. I agree with the other answer, you are not getting enough of the right kind of sleep. I don't recommend getting any kind of sleep aides. This isn't going to help your problem. You do what I do. I have trouble sleeping too. I let my mind wonder of all the things I need to do. Try to relax without the TV on. Have you thought of sleeping after you little on goes to school and then run errands? Or do the errands on your days off? <br>  <br>  My son is the same age. Do you have him help out with dinner? Mine likes to help from time to time. Make dinner simple or make some meals in advance to make it easy during the work week. Take care.|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Parents are tired. They are responsible.

You need to reset your internal clock so you can get into that deep REM sleep. You can get help from a sleep clinic. Or you can try to do it yourself. <br>  You need 8 hours of sleep minimuim. So your son needs to go somewhere after school. or you need to ask for a different schedule, or consider trying for another job. <br>  In the meantime, you have to have those 8 hrs or you will be no good to anyone. This is very unhealthy and must be effecting all kinds of internal organs, the stress hormone alone will pack on pounds and that can lead to heart problems. <br>  Try making the morning a very precious time. So as soon as you get home, get busy, prepare a meal and do some chores before he gets up, or get him up earlier. When you do some chores enjoy a fast pace, because even though you are tired you are going to get a good nights rest. Prepare a nice meal for yourself and your son.Make it special and have fun. Make sure it is light and healthy {no heavy complex carbs like pasta, potatoes and bread, consider salad and a light protein, resist junk food and chocolate or caffinated drinks or spicey food}. What you eat effects your sleep. No food after this meal. <br>  Get him off to school leave errands for a weekend. Go straight home, pull your black out drapes, take a quick soothing bath, take a sleeping pill {I use anti-nausea pills which my pharm. told me was the same thing} turn on a floor fan to dull noise, and go to sleep. It might take two pills at first because it is new. Oh, and set your alarm for eight hours. {that's in bed by nine and up by five} Have your child delivered home by five. Have a satisfying meal with him {here you can have the complex carbs} do an activity such as walking, and projects around the home, give him some chores, help him with homework etc. , then get him into bed and go to work. Focus on balance and health. You can read up on eating that maximizes your energy. Herbal teas such as Kombunca and Chinese Mushroom tea is excellent. So is fresh food, It is the only way you can do this right now.
LRbxal5Faa	Wouldn't it be lovely if I could wave a magic wand over my head and wake up in the morning without my worst habits?<br>  <br>  During the years I spent figuratively looking for that magic wand, I was actively thinking some of my strongest characteristics were bad habits. Fair enough, actually. As long as I was treating them like bad habits, I was using them like bad habits instead of developing better ways to use them. Boy, howdy, was I ever irritating. Creepy, too.<br>  <br>  A two-pronged approach helped me past it. One was accepting and loving myself exactly as I am, bad habits and all. This helped me know myself well enough to begin identifying what to nourish and what to let go of. For example, I have a gift for language. That is a characteristic. I had the habit of prattling endlessly, inserting my verbal diarrhea where it was not welcome, etc., etc. I began to develop the gift and let go of the habits where I was using the gift badly.<br>  <br>  The second prong was to let my interactions with other people be about the other people and not about me. I already know myself. My interest is learning about you. If you are interested, I will tell you about myself, but my interest is not in what I already know. I don't know you. Please, tell me. I will use my gift of language to draw you out.|`|0QTq76Shaa	Well I know alot of people with ADD. I think the best thing that you would beable to do (by the way listen to the other people too) is find something you love doing.

Kisses, flirtations, considerate gestures, cuddles... <br>  <br>  Personally, having been through a similar (but not as bad) experience, I find it alot easier to talk to insecure guy's, guy's who are shy and not really sociable because they're kind of innocent in a way, sincere and genuine... and making someone else feel good makes me feel good :) emotionally satisfied.<br>  <br>  Find out what emotionally satisfies you.<br>  <br>  good luck <3 hope things turn out bright!|`|BUvvstsjaa	I disagree, first start saying no to sex.  Sex is right when you're married.  In this way you'll get stronger, you will have yourself and you will start feeling good about yourself.  Know this, you are not alone.  This kind of thing happens to many girls, it's wrong.  I hope this helps you, it's the truth.
xN2EyoU0aa	The main reason for this is that people often fail to distinguish between culture and religion -- two things that are completely different. In fact, Islam condemns oppression of any kind whether it is towards a woman or humankind in general.<br>  <br>  The Quran is the sacred book by which Muslims live. This book was revealed 1400 years ago to a man named Muhammad –peace be upon him-, who would later become the Prophet –peace be upon him-. Fourteen centuries have passed and this book has not been changed since, not one letter has been altered.<br>  <br>  In chapter 33, entitled Surah Al-Ahzaab (The Clans), verse 59 Allah The Exalted Almighty Says (what means): "O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the woman of the believers to bring down over themselves (part) of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known (as free respectable women) and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." [Quran 33:59] This verse shows that Islam makes wearing a Hijaab necessary. Hijaab is the word used for covering, not only the headscarves (as some people may think) but also wearing loose clothes that are not too bright.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, people see covered Muslim women and they think of this as oppression. This is wrong. A Muslim woman is not oppressed, in fact, she is liberated. This is because she is no longer valued for something material, such as her good looks or the shape of her body. She compels others to judge her for her intelligence, kindness, honesty and personality. Therefore, people judge her for who she actually is.<br>  <br>  When Muslim women cover their hair and wear loose clothes, they are obeying the orders of their Lord to be modest, not cultural or social mores. In fact, Christian nuns cover their hair out of modesty, yet no one considers them “oppressed”. By following the command of Allah, Muslim women are doing the exact same thing.<br>  The lives of the people who responded to the Quran have changed drastically. It had a tremendous impact on so many people, especially women, since this was the first time that the souls of man and women were declared equal -- with the same obligations as well as the same rewards. <br>  <br>  For the first time in history, women were granted economic independence in Islam. The money they bring in to marriage is theirs as well as the money they earn. In Islam, women are allowed to choose their own husbands and in extreme cases, ask for divorce. A woman has the right to be educated, contrary to what the contemporary world might think. The responsibility is that of the person who is raising her. <br>  <br>  Islam is a religion that holds women in high regard. Long ago, when baby boys were born, they brought great joy to the family. The birth of a girl was greeted with considerably less joy and enthusiasm. Sometimes, girls were hated so much that they were buried alive. Islam has always been against this irrational discrimination against girls and female infanticide.<br>  The Prophet Muhammad, PBUH, said: "Seeking knowledge is mandatory for every Muslim (male and female)." Men and women both have the capacity for learning and understanding. Since it is also their obligation to promote good behavior and condemn bad behavior in all spheres of life, Muslim women must acquire the appropriate education to perform this duty in accordance with their own natural talents and interests.<br>  <br>  While maintenance of their homes, providing support to the husband and bearing, raising and teaching children are among the first and very highly regarded roles for a woman, if she has the skills to work outside the home for the good of the community, she may do so. However, this is allowed only as long as her family obligations are met and as long as she complies with the Islamic code of dress and conduct, with no intermingling with men in the workplace. <br>  <br>  Islam recognizes and fosters the natural differences between men and women despite their equality. Some types of work are more suitable for men and other types for women. This differentiation in no way diminishes the effort or benefit of one gender over the other. God will reward both genders equally for the value of their work, though it may not necessarily be within the same sphere of activity.<br>  The two great roles a woman plays in life are that of a wife and a mother. The Prophet –peace be upon him-, once said to a group of Companions:<br>  Concerning motherhood, the Prophet Muhammad, PBUH, said: "Heaven lies under the feet of mothers." This implies that the success of a society can be traced to the mothers who raised it. The first and greatest influence on a person comes from the sense of security, affection and training received from the mother. Therefore, a woman having children must be educated and conscientious in order to be a skillful parent.<br>  A man came to the Prophet, PBUH, and asked: "Who among my kinfolk is worthy of my good companionship?" The Prophet –peace be upon him-, replied: "Your mother" three times before saying: "Your father." T|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	As a group? No, but of course, there are some women who are victims of Islam in the ME. A Muslim woman went undercover with a hidden camera and caught a truckload of woman in the back of a pickup truck who were taken to an abandoned sports stadium and shot through the back of the head one by one. Their crime? Possession of lipstick.<br>  EDIT: To "priscilla hilton" the "Muslim witch" you refer to had HER eyes burned out with acid by the same man who is now going to receive his JUSTICE. Try doing some research before you post.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I would say that the only way they are oppressed is in the way that are accused of being at fault for things that are out of their control. For instance a pervert takes some interest in her and suddenly shes to blame cause she was showing her ankles or wrists or anything else someone can accuse her of supposedly showing. Then theres the issue of Muslim women not being able to know their husbands friends, so if this friend never marries, she will never visit this mans home, and if he visits hers, she will not be allowed to sit in the same room. This is ridiculous because she is prevented from really knowing who her husband associates with. So she will never be able to form a proper opinion of this person who could be influencing her husband in a bad way.|`|NYU37jfGaa	You can't lump all Muslim societies together into one.  In some Muslim countries women have more rights and more freedom than in others.  The Islamic religion itself seems to be attractive to some women, otherwise it is hard to explain why some women convert to Islam of their own accord for instance.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I'm an American convert and I love being a Muslim and  ilove the deep core of Islam; however, the perceived lack there of Muslim women having any rights is because of you men; especially where it concerns dress. I have read the Quran I know all about those ayats, but what's wrong with the picture is you men make sure we're going to tow the line; never minding us making our own decisions, you're going to make them for us. And yes there are many of you who do resort to force. Take it or leave it.<br>  I regard myself as having full rights as to how I dress, I don't cover and my husband knows he can't force me. I use to cover, for years I covered; that is till I came here to live in Saudi Arabia; then one day I had enough! I ripped it off and that was all she wrote. I want to do it under my own free-will not because I'm being forced and, or the impending threat of being forced. My husband is very understanding; many women are not that fortunate.<br>  Yes, I know all about the money and that the maiden name is kept even after marriage, but you know something else I believe that Arab Christian women follow the same rules when it comes to those things. A very wise Arab Muslim woman once told me that there is no difference beteen an Arab Christian woman and an Arab Muslim woman; they're one and the same.<br>  All negative perceptions come from you men; not Islam, there is no force in Islam, yet there most of you are; forcing you will and to hell with our own.<br>  I have my own will; others are not allwed to have it.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	It's not a matter of the religion itself oppressing them.<br>  It has more to do with the governments of certain Islamic nations.|`|nhZb43pIaa	Yes, yes, yes.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	You would have to ask Muslim women this question. You cannot ask American women. What we think is oppression may not be to them due to cultural aspects. Someone who lives that live is the only one who can give an honest answer. I would say their would be various answers and some would say they do not feel oppressed and some do not. Depending upon demographics, culture, etc. Not all Muslim women are from the same culture or demographics.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	I was raised Muslim...<br>  <br>  The problem is not that Muslim women are oppressed, the problem is that many Muslim women are not given the choice to surrender or submit. Islam is a militant religion which requires it's followers to "submit" completely and surrender themselves to Islam. A Muslim is a slave to Allah, all Muslims are slaves to Allah. Muslims have accepted this submission, it's not "oppression" when a person consents to "oppression". The problem is that Muslims have used Hadiths & culture to oppress women instead of giving them the choice to submit. Sharia Law & Islamist ideology is derived from these Hadiths & from cultural influences. Muslim women will be oppressed as long as they are not given the choice if they want to surrender or not. If you are given a choice to submit and surrender, you are not being oppressed, it is a decision you make out of your own free will. If you are forced to submit and surrender, that is oppression.<br>  <br>  For example, women being forced to wear the niqab in Saudi Arabia and women being forced to wear the hijab in Iran is oppression, it is not submission. Women who wear the hijab/niqab out of their own free will are submitting themselves to Islam, but they are not oppressed. Women who are forced to wear the hijab/niqab by their governments, cultures or families are being oppressed. <br>  <br>  There is a common misconception that Islam means "peace"... it does not. Islam means "submission". Islam also does not mean "oppression". Liberal Muslims don't have to sugarcoat Islam and insist that it means peace when it does not, and fundamentalist Muslims don't have to brutalize Islam by insisting that Islam means oppression when it does not. Muslims should not change the meaning of submission to peace or to oppression, neither is productive and both misrepresent Islam.<br>  <br>  Even "Muslim" means "One who submits to Allah", not "One who is oppressed by Allah". To be able to submit, you must have the free will and choice to submit, you cannot be forced to submit, for that is oppression. For many Muslim women, there is no free will and no choice... their cultures, families and governments dictate that free will and choice is not an option for them, even if Islam says that it is.<br>  <br>  I have seen Muslim women being forced to surrender and submit, in the West. Being forced to marry in arranged marriages, sometimes to relatives or cousins. They expressed both their sadness and acceptance of their fate to me. Some tried to shrug off their forced surrender with the defensive "I'm actually really liberated, more liberated than objectified Western woman" shtick, but I knew what they once were before they reached an age where their parents thought they were ready to be married. I even see it in girls much younger, as young as 7 or 8 or even younger... toddlers! I see their parents grooming them to surrender, sending them to Islamic schools, not being allowed to play with boys, little girls wearing hijabs and not being allowed to live a childhood.<br>  <br>  Sure, it's not black and white, I know better than that. Muslims should stop valuing the Western media's opinion so much and value their own opinion. Is this really what Muslims want?|`|096b7gBHaa	if you want to look at them as opressed, that's just the way you look at it. <br>  <br>  been living for decades through a western oriented life, i can't see how westernization is actually doing good for us, unless the fact that women can get education, aren't disallowed from working and their opinions can be upon consideration. but those are available in Islam too (studied the religion), just that it's not practice by some empty fanatism so-called religious movement that are ruled by men who are having issues. abuse on women are still neverending stories in western. the problem is that they can't even stay at the same rate but to increase each days. in fact, there are more abuses here than middle east. at least it isn't common for the abuse on women by muslims having the man to strip his woman down before throwing her out of the house, unlike by many of the western men. although i can't say if muslim countries are all free from crimes. there ain't any perfect land on this earth. <br>  <br>  <br>  the westerns, especially Americans have been living being spoonfed by the media. that's why losers among us can easily think that they're somewhat gorgeous only coz some of the higher class and hot people are doing good in the high-cost entertainment industry.<br>  <br>  Americans / Westerns, who are mostly Christians; but the real bible is the media.<br>  <br>  Muslims are human too. i also wonder why because of some screwed up Muslims, all Muslim and in fact the religion Islam must be blamed. nobody is perfect. there are worst people in western world, yet we don't even notice them. if what non-Muslims concerns about Islam is only the suicide bombing, women oppression, virgins in heaven and that men can marry up to 4 wives (but which actually only under certain circumstances and responsibility), then they're missing a lot about the religion in real fact. people simply believe because that are what the media said and the best thing is, they don't even do a thing to find if it's that true or not. <br>  <br>  there are more women reverting to Islam than men, even in the U.S., and plenty of them aren't just for the sake of marriage, since the women are still single after embraced Islam. that won't happen if Islam really oppress women, as how many have been said it|`|qgL98Wv2aa	well that's hard to say about the ones who live in this country.....here they have a choice to live like that and many do we have some in our neighborhood who dress covered head to toe and some who only cover their heads and many work, drive so i really don't know where you were going with your question......|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Not according to the feminist in my source...|`|mlsmSMzHaa	Sweetie<br>  <br>  Some muslim witch has won the courts approval to have a guy's eyes burned out with acid!<br>  <br>  Come back to me when those jerks drag themselves out of the middle ages<br>  <br>  k?|`|qzPbcHpmaa	Some of them, but then again some of other religion women are oppressed as well.|`|3ZSsBYtnaa	Are Muslim Women Oppressed ?<br>  .........................................<br>  From cradle to grave they are prisoners.

wKbEKg0Paa	Your ability to learn from experience will be hampered. Emotions affect learning. Even if you may logically know something to be right, you are less likely to do it if your emotions do not support it. Without emotions, you can't feel guilt and thus you are more likely to commit acts of evil. A psychopath basically does things without emotional attachments.|`|LRbxal5Faa	No, friend, I would not sue for this. I did not. I have siblings who are still looking for their suits, though.<br>  <br>  I did, however, get to be so good at taking rejection that I learned how to take it before it was given. It was easier to control that way. Then I learned how reject people before they wanted to reject me. It's even easier to control that way. Empowering, too.<br>  <br>  Sure was lonely, though.

I have been told that I do not know the difference between the two.  I am also very emotional and lately I find myself crying at the drop of a hat.  Truth be told, I should be happy because I have been liberated from a cruel, toxic relationship.  The problem, for me, is that I have become addicted to the pain and abuse.  My feelings are real.  I feel loss, I cry.  But then, it is time for me to acknowledge that this is a feeling and it is time to think.  Think about my feelings and the reality of where I am now in my life.  My old life was very structured when I was led around by the nose by a very abusive, controlling husband.  My new reality is that I have to provide my own structure and discover what it is that I want to do.  I know what I have to do, as I work and care for my teenage daughter, but discovering what I WANT is another question all together.  I too am impatient, I want answers but the last thing I want to do is rush into another structured relationship.  That would be too comfortable.  So, for a time I must sit with my uncomfortable feelings and acknowledge them, but realize that thinking about REALITY will keep me focused on a better future.  Just accept yourself, never mind the rest of the world and be patient.
xGb2CBgkaa	"Bank nationalization" is scaring markets around the globe because of the bond side of the equation.  As an example, Citibank has only something like 20-30 billion in stock value, which isn't a whole lot compared to the rest of the stock market.  You zero out shareholder value, it doesn't affect that many people.  But Citibank has over a trillion dollars in bonds and debts.  Once you nationalize the banks, you're opening up the possibility that the bank bondholders may get their clocks cleaned.  Think of bondholders being required by the federal government to write down about 200-300 billion of their debt.  <br>  <br>  This debt is owed to bondholders across the globe.  The ripple effects to the global financial system would be catastrophic, leading to bank failures and nationalizations all over the globe.<br>  <br>  This is why the Obama administration is very careful and reluctant about doing a nationalization.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	There are over a thousand  banks and the government could not efficiently  run them, They do not have the personnel to even run a few.

How about having a nice stable loving relationship before just having sex ?? then your chances of someone crying rape would be that much lower. And by the way, there are physical signs of actual rape that go a long way towards a woman's proof. Women who just cry rape are usually discounted because of this. And no I'm not telling you what those signs are. I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of women in general and perhaps you need therapy, someone has really twisted your head around.|`|WkLJI40baa	No, because the evidence would not be admissible in court and you would still go to jail for video taping the event without her consent.<br>  <br>  Having her sign an agreement would not fully protect you either, she could easily state she was coerced into signing it. <br>  <br>  I truly would like to hear how a man could protect himself from a false claim of rape.|`|AA10796679	first of all, the act of love is not a sexual act. if your talking about a man having intercourse with a woman and he is afraid he will be accused of rape later, then he should use the brain in the upper head not the lower head.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Chances are good the tape will be dismissed as evidence if there was no consent for the taping.

sPDOMTTjaa	When you were at the bus stop & the workman drove by, beeped his horn & winked, things such as this have been going on since the beginning of time. However, that doesn't make it right. Aside from typical incidents like you just described, there is an increase in disrespect towards women. A lot of it has to do with more & more males being raised in single parent homes. The guy above that said his mother taught him how to treat women hit the nail on the head; most men were brought up in homes where their father was abusive towards their mother; and the guy that was raised to treat women right is a rare species these days. <br>  <br>  Also, it's just a sign of the times. The only thing that you can do, and this applies to all females(especially young girls), is demand respect. You can't stop a group of construction workers going crazy when you walk by, but you can refuse to stop taking any crap. By this I mean that girls should stop getting involved in personal relationships with  guys that treats them badly, they can stop giving in to men that pressure them to do things they don't want to do, they can stop wearing clothes that are advertising that they're open & ready for business, etc. Some may be offended by the clothes remark-  Well, consider this situation that a young woman went through recently-  <br>  <br>  A girl who began to sense she was in danger on the streets of a downtown city was looking for help when she finally saw a policeman, and decided to ask him for help, but when she anxiously runs up to him, out of breath & hysterically says- "Officer, officer I need your help now!" He looks at her strangely & says- "I'm not a policeman", then she says, still nervous & out of breath- "But you have on a policeman's uniform & you even have a badge, see look" she said while pointing to indeed an official looking badge", by now the 'policeman' is highly offended, he looks at her and says- "Just because I've got on a policeman's uniform doesn't mean I'm a policeman"!|`|qPj7p6D1aa	O.K. we are all granted an opinion even if its from the far-side of the universe. Attention from the male ego is what the female is in contest With. There is a particular amount of insecurity attached to men and women alike accept the female uses a declaration of how much avon she can pile on instead of remaining a natural beauty, the men pour on the after-shave or cologne in hopes another female will set a snare to capture him. A smelly "bod" is almost secondary when we're influenced by the hormonal effects concerning sexuality, we could always pinch our nose shut. For the female: If there is a feeling that all men are casted from the same vessel then the difficulty is not with them but your own resistance which seems rather low. I'm always open for comments if you have any. See profile.|`|8d7f5acede355fc1f294a7fd7e6fbc93aa	While it's very easy, convenient, and sometimes tempting, to pass on all the guilt to the woman in question, by casting doubts over her decency in clothing, I would still prefer the old-fashioned approach of condemning men for such actions.<br>  But all men are not pigs, to give them proper credit. Most men, I believe, are nice, decent fellows, who think of women as their able partners and competent co-workers. Only perverts, and psychologically starved persons act in immodest manner to 'attract' attention of women.<br>  The question that ought be asked is not WHY men are pigs, but WHAT you can do in such situations. In my opinion, neglecting their 'advances' is the best remedy. If you reply back, even angrily, you are only playing in for what they wanted. They wanted your attention, and so to deprive them of it is the best punishment to them.|`|5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	It is simple genetics.<br>  <br>  The nice cave men that didn't ogle and whistle at the girls, didn't get noticed.   So the wolf calling and club yielding ones got the girl, so their genes got passed through the generations.<br>  <br>  I guess the only way to mutate that genetic predisposition is to have your way with every shy guy you see.  You will be doing your part to save many future generations from being subjected to that type of behavior.<br>  <br>  Or you can just get over yourself and ignore it.  If you react in any way, you only confirm that type of behavior gets attention.

There's no chance of anyone finding it, especially someone having the caliber of skills and knowledge to pull information. People like that aren't digging through trash, they are running computer stores. Everything is in your favor. Simply meditate on these facts. When you feel yourself panicking, take a deep breath and rationalize. You're safe! <br>  <br>  However, I don't recommend dealing with your anxiety alone...if you don't want therapy, you need to find someone (or more) you can count on to help you through your worries. They don't even have to know about it...just someone who can lift your spirits and take you mind off things when you are with them.

Change or update as much of the information that you can,  (which you should do every so often anyway).  Chances are that thing was incinerated, and no one was even aware that it was in there...so relax, take a deep breath.  The odds are in your favor.

Come summer, I will expect to.  Based on all the places I've lived, I've found climate to be the number one predictor of how many homeless there are in any particular area.  A close second would be the type of community it is in.  My town is comprised of very friendly, liberal-minded people who are generally more affluent than most other communities this state.

MlhiDi8paa	Numerous research studies have established a relationship between stress and illness. This does not ean that stress is the direct cause of disease, but it cerainly acts s a catalist for disease. The culprit seems to be prolonged periods of stress, or so called chronic stress, rather than intense stress experianced over shorter periods of time. People who experianced stress over a 2 year period before being exposed to a common cold virus were three times morlikely to catch a cold than those who reported no stress. The researhers attributed the grater vulnerability to disease to tress-triggered changes in the immune system. Stess can make one sick because of the hormones and nerve pathways tht are activated by stress change the way the immune system responds,making it less abe to fight invaders.

The y chromosome triggers the body to develop male organs because it's male and the second x chromosome triggers the body to develop female organs because it's female.  If one of the x chromosomes doesn't activate the fetus won't be female by default, the embryo will die due to a genetic imbalance.<br>  <br>  There is no default sex and I can't imagine why anyone would believe this.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	That sounds like a plot for a new Feminist movie !|`|YQOT68xFaa	That is complete and utter crap science.

Everything develops in a certain order; the most essential systems develop first - heart and blood supply, nervous system, organs, skeleton and muscles. Then sex characteristics start to form, because they aren't as necessary for survival as those other things. But make no mistake, that embryo is either male or female from the start.

jyGTlpzTaa	Try and figure out where the feelings come from...does it all feel pointless, do you feel empty? These might point to mild depression, depression doesnt necessarily mean wanting to hurt yourself, a constant low mood is a pointer, eating and sleeping problems, feelings of emptiness, things seeming pointless. I suffer from a mild form, it might be worth trying to find a counsellor if you can, there are good free ones out there (in the UK, but the waiting list is long). Or try talking to friends.<br>  <br>  Tiny steps help...for example, commit to cleaning one part of your room a day...just a corner at a time, or even just one piece of furniture a day. One day your wardrobe, the next your desk, etc. The same will help with eating and exercising...start with a ten minute brisk walk daily, then up to 15 minutes the next week, and so on and so forth. With eating, you could try commiting to making one meal healthy and low fat, and then another meal, then another, then switch to healthy snacks.

There's a difference between sadness and depression. However, since you recognize that you do have an issue, it's most likely a case of the blues. You care enough about yourself to change, but you don't know how to. <br>  <br>  Your laziness is a hubris, it's part of the culture, we'll get into that later, what's important is that you find work and move with a purpose in life.<br>  <br>  Since the economy is somewhat in shambles, may I suggest finding work that is tedious and labor intensive. Labor work, such as loading and unloading trucks at a warehouse or shelf stocking.<br>  <br>  Some will call this "immigrant, ditch digging work." However, many immigrants who do labor jobs, do the jobs simply because they have the mentality of "move with a purpose or starve to death." <br>  <br>  This is the kind of mentality you need.

1KnDF5Pcaa	Saying music is a bad influence overall is jumping to conclusions. You say you listened to music for a week, I ask: what kind of music did you listen to? Different types of music are known to create different reactions in people. What causes elation and emotion flurries in one person might only cause boredom in another.<br>  <br>  It's a nice experiment you've set, it's definitely relevant in today's world, but you have confounded variables.  It could be that your emotions were only stirred by the specific type of music you're listening to.  A sample of size of 1 person is also not nearly large enough to make accurate inferences about the population as a whole as well.<br>  <br>  I listen to multiple types of music, and while some drive me to be particularly creative, I wouldn't say it ever gets out of hand. So, for myself, music is something great.<br>  <br>  I could be nasty, and make a bunch of different assumptions about why music gives you those feelings, and why you reported it the way you did. And honestly, the psychological community would back me up on it. However, I will simply say that your personality types responds particularly strongly to music, and the emotions can run strong as a result from that.|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	I agree that music affects our minds and moods.

wKbEKg0Paa	Paranoia is rooted in having an irrational set of beliefs about people and the environment around you. The only way to get around irrational beliefs is to test or challenge them. You should ask yourself, "Are my beliefs about the person or thing I am afraid of supported by reality?" It's not the things themselves that are usually frightening but the thoughts we have about them. The key is to find objective knowledge about the things that make you paranoid.|`|hpzfccwaaa	You are obviously trying to walk past a destructive environment if you can not see the path or road ahead of you then you must trust and obey a plan for your next steps.|`|NVqmnFuUaa	Paranoia is a thought process characterized by excessive anxiety or fear.But sometimes,in common usage,the term "paranoia" is misused to describe a phobia.For example,a person would not like to fly out of fear that it would crash.This "not" itself indicate paranoia,but rather a phobia.In this regards what you are suffering now is some form of phobia which is a psychologist can really help you a lot.
1qwB5MHaaa	hahhh another good question. exactly what i wanted to ask too.<br>  but i'll just answer from my opinion.<br>  as an introvert myself, i admit that i do have a LOT in my mind. but during times, i tend to speak out more. like in school, in my small circle of friends, i could be THAT girl who makes funny jokes and the lively, cheery type. THAT girl who is happy and contented. (but, er, that doesn't happen in Big groups) <br>  everybody knows that is Something under that mask. but know what? nobody ever asks what that "something" is. sometimes, just sometimes, people accept you for who you are. and as long as everyone's happy, then that's it. <br>  everybody's quiet in some ways. even total extroverts get that too. everybody has to have their own space. everybody needs their own space to think, dream, write, sing, dance etc. that makes an individual, from all perspective. without that little "spcae", that person is no longer someone who's a "someone".<br>  i notice that those who are bolder in class, the out-goers, most of them have family problems. "family problems" here doesn't really mean a bilnd mother, a deaf father, divorced pareants, no. just disatisfaction. towards their family. and in school, they put on a clear mask and act out happy, bring out the happiness. those people are actually doing a very beautiful job, and not an easy one too. but mind you, i'm not them. <br>  and introverts, they usually turn out as pretty normal people. tho some of them do not. maybe just being more quiet, like us, we get to have more space to think and observe and analyze. they understand more, notice more, and change more. and, they usually see things from different sides.|`|efcb47c90afef04ac3b097e68d6e9833aa	yes sometimes extrovert are hiding something with their outgoingness, I think this is very common.. btw I like quieter people like you more than extroverts, extrovert are always trying to get attention but quieter people are allot deeper in my opinion|`|ZkrGttKaaa	I am an extrovert.

You can confront her in a non-threatening way, by asking her if she has seen the items in question, as you might have 'misplaced them'.  Of course, if she stole them, I doubt she'll admit to it anyway...and if you accuse her and she didn't do it, then she may quit, or be so indignant that having her in your home may become a problem.  Basically, you can consider your items gone, and you will probably never find out what happened to them.  If you really believe she took them, give her the opportunity to confess, and if she does, tell her if it happens again she will be discharged.  If you confront her and she lies to you (ususally you can tell), dismiss her on the spot.|`|DsEEATKSaa	Simply do not re-hire.<br>  <br>  If she did steal your toys, it is unlikely you'll ever see them again.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|PRg9UgOlaa	I would ask her if she moved anything because you cannot find what you are looking for.

Or instead a could set up a SELF SUFFICIENT company / organization that help a lot of people to a lesser extent.  One would seem better than the other while keeping my interest protected.

All three had a gdp per capita almost than half the US in 1940 but since have lost ground.   The reason  these countries did not keep up is usually ascribed to government corruption and instability in part due to the extreme inequality that allowed the rich land owners to control polices that benefited them.

DT6QFP7Yaa	Industrialisation helps an economy to grow by providing employment opportunity to he needy.Besides,the govt. collects various types of tax from the industry which is spent on creation of infrastructure n on social sector. More over,the industry produces various types of goods which caters to the needs of the people ,the defence n other sectors of the economy.Therefore,many developed countries of the  world  concentrate on industrialisation for their  further development.In India more than 70 % people live in the rural areas n depend on agriculture to earn their living.For that ,immediately after independence our planners n policy makers stressed on the development of agriculture n conveniently for got industry.As a result we r still a developing  not developed country.Our GDP growth remained lower.It was only after the 1992 policy that we attached importance on industry n the result is before all of us to see.However,it has a dark side also.Many people who lose their land do not get adequate compensation.That needs to be looked in to.|`|y2Hrm4ioaa	Industralisation improves the gross domestic product and thus brings about economic development.As a result it improves the standard of living of the people.|`|GllB4mPZaa	Lengthy answer...sorry.|`|VpNCHEfZaa	Reduce it? Why would we want to reduce it?<br>  Depending on the dominant traits of an economic system, the effects of industrialization vary from country to country though in my opinion most of them are positive. Let me briefly outline a few positives...<br>  Industrialization creates employment,taxation revenue for the government,provides market for other locally produced goods within the economy like if the Industries are food processors, they improve the B.O.P and T.O.T (Balance of Payment and Terms of Trade) positions of a country for it has more to export,infrastructural development like roads and rail networks. There are many others. However the negative being fewer like pollution.  In conclusion, being that many world economies are industrial based ( most of Asia i.e China,Japan,India and Europe and America) it is a very crucial sector and influences the world economy greatly as even many listed companies are industrial. So generally an improvement in any industrial sector will result in economic growth and vice versa<br>  Hope my answer will be helpful in case of further clarification required please get in toucn with me...

It is believed that there are many different species of the homo genus but some lines may have become extinct while other may have crossed species. Humans would have been moving back and forth all over the globe, crossing paths for millions of years and the genetic make-up would be a mix-match of these "originals" I think it is more likely the adaptation to ones surroundings that creates a dominant genetic characteristic amongst a particular class of individuals and to try and classify them as different races would be misleading.

t2R3mEMoaa	maybe now that you have aired your thoughts, they will no longer over power you. Lets hope so shall we. If this didn't work then I would suggest you talk with a therapist who may have a very simple and clear answer or it may be something you will have to work on for awhile. Either way you will get better because it is a fact that pent up thoughts once released have lost their power to control you anymore. You have owned them and can now release them. Have a great day which I'm sure is now a little bit lighter for you.|`|1471ToHraa	The fact that you are repulsed by the thoughts are good indication of your likely behaviour, however try to abolish violent thoughts once and for all.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid any violent imagery as much as possible, don't watch the news, don't play violent video games, don't read about bad stuff in the papers.<br>  <br>  Meditating might help, go read some Zen or Buddhist texts. Good luck, and remember that you will never become violent for any reason.
O1Sqcc5yaa	Pragmatism isn't necessarily about the majority, it's about what is realistic.  The philosophical question here is: Realism vs. Idealism.  Realism is preferred by most world leaders because it gets things done.<br>  <br>  For example, imagine if someone kidnapped a person and you only had to pay 1 dollar for their release, otherwise they'd be killed.  An idealist, based on principle, would say, "I shouldn't have to pay anything because you have no right to do any of this, so I won't pay."  An realist, based on pragmatism, would say "Okay, it is the best result for me to lose 1 dollar and for the person to be released, so here's a dollar."<br>  <br>  Basing decisions on principle is doing what should happen in an ideal world regardless of the consequences, but basing them on pragmatism is weighing the possible outcome of each course of action (cost-benefit analysis) and acting out the one with the highest benefits and lowest cost, regardless of whether it is the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  My bias is clearly towards pragmatism and realism, but idealists have a legitimate basis for their stance as well.  For example, the world would certainly be better off if everyone was an idealist with similar ideals, because then bad things wouldn't happen.  Also, if everyone was a strict realist, then no one would ever follow principles or do what is right/moral/etc.<br>  <br>  My problem with the above arguments is that I believe it is extremely unlikely, based on my opinion of innate human nature, for the entire world to become idealists or realists and as long as there is both, I prefer a philosophy based mostly on realism to get things done.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	The road to hell is paved with good intentions and all positions and policies have unintended consequences are two of the most important things that policy makers and diplomats need to remember.
h9WTyjOoaa	First of all I commend you for asking this question, You obviously care about her.  I will first refer you to a rather long answer I gave on suicidal thoughts at this question <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222221331AAGGv6m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  Now as for how to help her. be there for her, give her your confidence, be her strength when she has none.  This is both easier and harder than it sounds. To stand by her becomes hard but being there is as easy as being there literally.  Let her know you are there and never run from her.  If she hurts herself don't back away but instead get closer stay by her and tell her you will not leave her that upset, Sit there and be by her say nothing else and wait till she is done being upset or until she decides to talk to you.  Never tell her that her feelings are wrong they are her feelings not yours and she feels them... oh and even if it's true never say you are so cute when you are mad... i made that mistake sat by a girl's room for 2 hours to prevent her from cutting herself.<br>  <br>  Let's see what else.  Give her a bunny!<br>  <br>  Yeah ok that seems wierd but a simple bunny be it real or a really cute stuffed animal can really help cheer her up.  Know when she is down and when she is up. When she is down make sure you are there above all else. And that is the time ya get her a gift and spend time with her.  Make her know she is special not by your words but by your actions.  Become attuned to her emotions and learn what she needs and whats before she even knows what she needs or wants.<br>  <br>  Arcanist and Meta-Phsyicist Talos Vishmiirsna<br>  Owner/Operator of The Arcane Haven Metaphysical Supply and Knowledgebase<br>  Peregrine Druid of The Tuatha De Dannan Order|`|jPooSycJaa	Hating life can feel miserable, and since it's obvious that she's depressed it's more unfortunate that she won't talk to a professional.  As a friend it's important to approach this from her point of view and be very nonjudgmental, or she will eventually see you as just another person imposing their values on her.  No one likes to be judged, even if your trying to help her; and trying to convince her that "life is beautiful" will get old fast.  Perhaps the most helpful thing to do is research with her reasons for her hatred of life.  Would she take quizzes with you from the internet on depression, family conflicts or look up other possible diagnoses?   It would be great if she were to very specific about her hatred for life.  In any case just being a friend who listens and reflects back empathy can be the best thing to do first.   Don't forget to consult a professional if she talks about suicide.  It's hard to be a good friend if she's dead.|`|00cAPbToaa	Aww, its so sweet that you wanna help her.<br>  But theres really not much you can do for her...Find out why she is depressed and give her advice from your heart or you can ger her to go to a therepest person, maybe theyl give her depression pills or somthing, thats what they did to my freind, hopfully she'll get better, mbest of luck :]|`|JBLYXMJ5aa	welll it depends on what things in life are making her so depressed...<br>  talk tto her about how she should show off her greatness to the wolrd.. and while shes at it show the wolrd how strong she is emotionaly and that she can take down any mountain.. and compare her life to peoples lives that are worse<br>  than take her out for the best fun day of her life... and than make sure she realizez how much potentian she has to enjoy herself|`|tyO8Emrzaa	Only thing that I can really tell you is to look closely at the things she does do, and see which of them she does really well and try and use that as a platform and build off of there and try and show her that she isn't useless and that she doesn't really need to hate life. Yeah I know it seems like it's something straight out of a romance movie but trust me it can work, I did the same thing and my girlfriend isn't depressed anymore so maybe it might work for you maybe not.|`|bljEhh86aa	rent a good movie, funny movie or just go to a movie watch a comedian stand up movie or something like that.<br>  <br>  LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	You are getting yourself into a no-win situation here.  She DOES need help and you can't provide that to her.  You can be caring and supportive, but you can not fix her.  You also don't have the power to MAKE her happy.  She is responsible for making herself happy.  My guess from reading your question is that you want to endear yourself to her in some significant way so you will be her hero and she will remain your girlfriend.  She is not your pet project.  Suggestion:  get over yourself and strongly encourage her to either go to the school counselor to get some help or go to a private counselor to start working on her issues.  If she refuses to go, she probably is not going to learn to like her life any better.  If you are up for being in a relationship with a really depressed girl, then you are in the right place.

H3JK4Zp2aa	Once awakened, you will will not fall asleep again.  <br>  <br>  Although I personally avoid antidepressants or other modern drugs that alter the mind, for some they are a practical way to help aid a person through difficult times.  Winter can be a bummer and it is for me also.  In the past, I've had the option of accepting a prescription using a similar drug therapy treatment yet I've always declined.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different and decisions such as these are personal.  What I've done instead is to make myself become more proactive in finding natural solutions to my own depression.  I've pretty much have tried everything, but Tai Chi or Qi Gung classes have been an option that has worked for me in the past, but classes really aren't necessary if none are available in your area.<br>  <br>  Really, anything that helps to circulate the energy inside of you is an aid to releasing blockages.  Eastern holistic approaches towards balance and health have evolved over thousands of years and are becoming more widely accepted in western culture, even amongst establishment. Western medicine often treats symptoms but usually do not free the blockages that you might be storing within your body.<br>  <br>  Since I have been depressed also this winter, I have made a plan for myself.  This involves getting up early in the morning and doing some stretching before taking a walk.  The total investment of my daily regimen should be about an hour and I plan on doing this at least every other day and perhaps daily.  If you BEGIN your day with a regular healthy routine, you might be surprised at how quickly you can attain positive results for yourself.  Any activities that help circulate your "chi"  (or qi) is a more natural way to bring your body and mind into balance.<br>  I like hikes, in silence, with a friend and exploring areas that are new to me.<br>  <br>  I'm not discounting wellbuttrin though.

Then, you can begin the process of moving toward a solution with help from others and a positive commitment from yourself.

You can't condone theft in this case because then others would also seek to justify stealing because of need.  When you permit one person to break the law (even for a good reason) you are setting a precedence for others to follow suit.<br>  <br>  In the second scenario, I would ask myself how I might feel if my best friend knew something like that about my partner, and would I want to be told. In my opinion, I'm simply giving her information, what she does with it is her choice.  If it ends the friendship, then so be it.  But I would be sure to tell her that if things don't work out, I'll be there when she needs me, and I would make sure that I was.<br>  <br>  There are consequences to every choice you make in ethics, even the choice to do nothing at all has its own repercussions.

Yes he should be prosecuted but also given some kind of consideration out of desperation.  You cannnot allow vigilante type government and allow people to do things because they cannot get help.  HIS wife..however sad as it is..IS DYING!  He should explore everything available to him to get this medication including telling the doctor, hospitals, RED CROSS, social programs etc.  Someone would help.  There are programs and grants to help people like this.  I don't know if he should get any kind of punishment out of this..it would depend on the WHOLE story as everything is not black and white ...there are always shades of gray.  Past history, criminal history etc.   You cannot allow ANYONE to break into pharmacies...<br>  This might sound cold...but you asked for ETHICAL and that means MORAL.   <br>  <br>   What would the world be if everyone had a sad story and was allowed to go free because they needed something and stole it?  Prices go up because of things like this...and we pay for it....and becuase of this police lives are in danger all the time.  Who do you want protecting you.... Cops or vigilantes who make decisions on emotions and not laws?   Laws are supposed to protect YOU...vigilantes only represent one side.  <br>  <br>  The second question....this is difficult.<br>  <br>  I guess it would depend on the friend.  I have one friend who I would not tell...she doesn't handle things well...and I would be better for her to be there when it falls apart.  Another friend...I would tell.  We have been friends for over 50 years and I know our friendship inside out.  <br>  <br>  It is a question of personality and strength of the individual you are speaking about.  If they are strong people...then yes you tell them.  If they are strong people they deal with reality and truth...<br>  <br>  If they are more fragile....you wait until they need help.  This isn't about you but about them. What is best for THEM? What is in their BEST interests.  NOT about YOU and what you BELIEVE!  <br>  <br>  Some people handle life well...some need to go into things gradually and come out of denial and dreams more slowly.

I took a class where we designed and carried out an experiment and I can tell you this will get you no significant data.  You have 30 participants.  You have 3 independent variables with probably more than 2 levels each, that means you have 5 or fewer people per condition.  You should have at least 15 people per condition.  I would suggest limiting your experimental group to one variable, two levels.  For example, half eat bacon and eggs and half eat pancakes.<br>  <br>  Similarly you should have around 15 in your control group.<br>  <br>  Separation of genders is one way to equalize your group, but it is just as well to pick people at random.  You should not end up with too many more of one gender than another.<br>  <br>  What age level are you targeting?<br>  <br>  The overview should be rewritten because it is wrong (24?), and also it is not very informative.  Explain a bit about the participants, what sort of day they go through, what they will eat and how this is relevant.<br>  <br>  Lastly is the big one.  You need real quantitative dependent variables.  You may want to do tests.  Due to random selection you may be alright having these tests in the middle of a normal day.  The tests may be physiological (blood pressure, heart rate), self-report (ask them how energetic they feel, if they feel hazy etc.) or report by others, or a real test (see how quickly they can complete a simple crossword puzzle, or whatever you feel is appropriate).  You don't need many but you need to know why it is a good overall measure of energy and attentiveness.|`|H9RTbhKYaa	Or you can eat breakfast and be happy that you took the time to enjoy a meal.

Many people (largely feminists) believe that if the woman is 'not in the mood' then it is rape. This is generally countered by the argument that a person is able to give consent without being in the mood (I go to work, for example,not because I'm in the mood but because I consent to it, bear in mind though that 'having' to do something isn't always a valid argument only sometimes). <br>  <br>  It's certainly possible that a woman in this scenario could claim she's been raped. I would imagine that there has been a very similar case in real life but personally I would have to see the details and hear the accounts of the couple involved if I were to decide whether infact she had been raped.

If I ever see that man again I will want to knee cap him for what he did to me.<br>  <br>  And YES I had an abortion.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Add info: <br>  Wow.... some people answering this question amaze me.

If the other person is not actively consenting, consider it not safe to continue.|`|qGDWbJKpaa	It all really depends. Most likely, she will wont say its rape because if you are getting raped, you wake up and realize whats going on, you dont go to sleep.|`|0YhzBgu2aa	if the women is unconscious then its rape<br>  if she is sleepy, she is still conscious and that is not rape|`|DEc1C9hkaa	No, I wouldn't call it rape but I'm sure there is some way to twist this into a rape claim.|`|hZJPj5Aiaa	Too sleepy to say, "not tonight"?

The contraction period was officially  16 months and ended in november of 82 when the GDP began to grow again.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	A couple of years before President Reagan's tax cuts took hold.<br>  <br>  The worst mortgage problems back then was in Commercial Real Estate.<br>  <br>  I recall a sign on an office building in Atlanta, GA.<br>  "For Sale.<br>  Buy one, get one free".<br>  <br>  No one has even addressed that one today, yet.<br>  What happens to all the vacant stores and offices?<br>  Stay tuned.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	Its not similar.The current crisis is the culmination and supersession of all previous major systemic crises from the break up in 1971 of the Bretton Woods framework that attempted to avoid a relapse to the Great Depression pre-war years, to the financial shocks of the '80s and '90s (the 1984 Latin American ‘tequila crisis', the 1987 Crash, the 1997 Crash, centered in Asia and followed by Russia's default in 1998, the burst of the US ‘dot.com economy' in 2000, the recession of 2001-2002, Enron's debacle, Argentina's default etc) throughout the decades of finance globalization.<br>  In the period 2002-2006, the spiral of the crisis was deflected and the two interconnected engines of US credit expansion and China's industrial growth drove a relative upturn of world economy. But now, the two engines are stalling. The contraction of world economy tries to eliminate the enormous amounts of surplus capital both fictitious and productive that obstruct the process of capital accumulation<br>  <br>         Capital is not a thing but a social relation. The explosion in the foundations of the system is driving the tectonic plates of society changing all social relations and international relations. A way out from the impasse can be opened only through a series of historic confrontations between the conflicting social forces, first of all, between capital and labor. In other words, the solution of the crisis depends, at the last instance, from the confrontation between social revolution and counter-revolution on an international scale.|`|711cf445165d6c90d8f0944882e7e366aa	Real GDP started ticking up in Q1 1983.

I might examine my conscious to see if I am putting off an inevitable change or cheating myself out of something I want just because I'm afraid of the climb.<br>  <br>  Might. I can think of a whole heap of variables that would change the interpretation.|`|0IG3lEpaaa	That's very interesting. Maybe you feel helpless about something in your life.

GG2bxCd1aa	I would recommend you to put all efforts in becoming an independent person both socially and financially. We tend to fall on people mostly when we are insecure about our basic requirements. Being on your own will give you a lot of confidence and you will start feeling stronger. <br>  <br>  Please remember this is about a personality change, it won't happen overnight but will become a habit gradually.<br>  <br>  1- Exercise everyday. Physical fitness is largely responsible to keep yourself mentally strong too.<br>  <br>  2- Make a lot of friends- Try to make a lot of friends. Share talks and interests with intelligent people. <br>  <br>  3-Know what's happening around. Once you feel you are updated with knowledge,you will not look upon others to guide you for every small decision. You would know a lot on your own.<br>  <br>  4- Read self help topics on internet. Put keywords like your title of the questions and see if you can get some more nice tips.<br>  <br>  5-Do not ask others if what you did was right was wrong. Whatever you did good or bad, just accept it. Always think that whatever decisions I took in the past was according to your best ability and observation and you did the best.<br>  <br>  And last but not the least..b positive :)<br>  <br>  Try taking baby steps towards being a stronger person. When you think you are doing better, drop in another question and we'll take it to work harder from there. ALL THE BEST.|`|RZmAGYusaa	Talk to someone about it so a big pressure would be lifted from you , for example find your best friend or someone else who loves you and tell him all of what you feel , what your fear and worries are and fight them with him/her .
e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Consider your strengths, focus on your skills and interests. Pursuit those things that ignite your passion and lead you to questions. Find answers. Go with those who are supportive and are also moving forward. See fear as an opportunity to go forward in faith. Love yourself deeply, and nuture this. Accept yourself first, and you will find that you can accept others. Seek to understand rather than to judge. Observe before following. Treasure your emotions, they all hold gifts. Sadness is the opportunity to honor and trust yourself to dig deep and uncover the wisdom of who you are and what you treasure. Joy holds the gift of acceptance. Anger holds the gift of discovering the love you have been lacking. Life is an experience in which we are challenged to be the best person we can be in truth and honesty. It doesn't mean it is perfect, or you or anyone is perfect. It does mean that everything is imperfect, and in our efforts to be and to make things perfect, everything is imperfectly perfect.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	You have to change your thought process.

2X2wjYb4aa	I can sympathize to a degree....I'm a bit overweight and sometimes think I'm not doing enough to 'make' myself normal weight, etc. In addition, a close female friend seems to have a similar image issue - I don't think she's overweight, but she frets about it at least once a week, if not more. <br>  Perhaps because I'm a dinosaur by Yahoo! Answers standards (a ripe old 45) and have a little more experience to draw from, I guess I've come to terms with my appearance, character, personality, etc to the point that perceived flaws (real or imagined) don't bother me so much any more. <br>  Something that makes sense to me, and might for you, is the notion that some element...that is only ONE PART of the person you are. <br>  It is not YOU. <br>  It does not define you. <br>  Human beings are complex creatures; the shape of one's nose, the natural color of one's hair, one's height and weight do not tell the stories of our lives. <br>  Self-loathing is a common-enough practice amongst us, for whatever perceived flaws we have, and can become a habit if we allow it to. How to prevent it? That can take different forms, depending upon the individual: yoga, meditation, therapy, and creating art are just some of the ways of dealing with it, but I'm not sure we can ever really eliminate such feelings altogether. When we recognize it coming upon us, we can assert: "I have the right to not go there!" We have the right to not get bogged down in frustrating, time-wasting, energy-dissipating activity.|`|4191bf22931e9cc7e405f80b732d50fbaa	Usually self esteem issues derive from early childhood,with how a child was looked upon,and the influences that were negative. May I suggest write down all the flaws you think you have,and all the great attributes you have,then turn to the negative side of the page,and try to find something within the list that is positive,and cross off as you go on writing the positives. Self inner talk is a constant reminder that you are a good person and that you can acknowledge yourself for who and what you are in exactness..sometimes in extremes as you suggest- being depressed a lot, this may need some further attention by council. I truly wish you well, remember, you are You, no matter what or how anyone may have treated you in mannerism..thank Yourself,and reward yourself with positive things constantly.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|CXoYZGRoaa	exercising... workingout<br>  going on runs|`|b2zJ7cGFaa	First of all you adore your own beauty, think it you are most beautiful, stand before the mirror and see all through praise your body while doing makeup, don't think or compare with others, your body is the gift of god, You are the best, if I see you I will tell more.|`|YTYjzGAXaa	Same here, I feel bad if I eat too much. <br>  <br>  Try getting really good at something..

B1ueclBaaa	I waited as long as possible to answer.  No - you can't end homelessness just by providing counsel ling and treatment.  Treatment for what?  These people need jobs, a home, etc.  Just talking to them isn't going to solve those problems.  IMHO - these people just gave up on themselves and didn't know where else to turn for help,  Counseling and treatment would be a good start, but it's not a realistic long term solution.

CxoogGzxaa	You should see a sleep specialist. Frequent sleepwalking should be taken seriously as you might end up hurting yourself. Only a specialist can correctly tell you why you sleepwalk, and what can be done with it. Also, considering your unusual awakenings, you might want to get checked out for other possible sleeping disorders as well. If you are stressed, this could be the cause for that as well, but you will want to get such an evaluation from a specialist rather than random people at Y!A.
U69Q6rsWaa	1. Participation should always be voluntary, people should not be coerced into participation. It is sometimes acceptable to supply monetary compensation (or course credit or whatever) to encourage sign up, but participants should not face the threat of consequences for not taking part. <br>  <br>  2. Participants should have the right to withdraw at any time they wish, they cannot be told that they have to stay till the end.<br>  <br>  3. Participants should not be exposed to any (unnecessary) physical or mental harm. Allowing sleep deprived participants to drive home is probably out.<br>  <br>  4. Participant consent should be informed, they should be made aware of any potential risks (the anxiety, headaches etc.), and where appropriate, be supplied with someone to contact if these symptoms arise. <br>  <br>  5. Participants have the right to confidentiality and anonymity. Identifying information should not be revealed to anyone outside of the study, and it is unethical to identify them by name (or any thing else that could be used to identify them) in reports/presentations.<br>  <br>  6. Similar to before, participants have the right to withdraw at *any* time, this includes their data being excluded after the experiment has been completed. If a participant objects to you using their data (prior to publishing, not much you can do about it afterwards), you have to comply.|`|854xeaRvaa	i don't have particular knowledge in this, but i think coercion and publishing the results with the students' names are the obvious ones.

o0mwF5kFaa	Get mad: you need to convince yourself of this: Nobody has the right to make you look, or feel small in order to make themselves feel better. You need to believe that you are important too, and that you should not in ANY way be compromised for anyone else unless you so choose.<br>  <br>  People waking up to you and taking advantage of you are IN THE WRONG; therefore your conscience is also wrong when it tells you to hold back. FREE yourself form your conscience, and let the anger flow. Then just pull back your hand, angle it, and with an open hand, SLAP that fool, and just keep hitting until he stops resisting.<br>  <br>  You'll feel good in the end. BELIEVE ME. You don't have to be nice to people who don't care about your well being. And believe it or not, your emotional well being is sometimes more damaging than your physical well being. Someone with deep fears and insecurities can never heal unless he confronts a powerful thing and conquesrs it. Physical wounds heal naturally. STRENGTHEN YOURSELF.<br>  <br>  I don't really care much for anime, but I hear this good quote from Bleach: There were two people fighting, a master and his student. But the student was holding back, afraid of hitting his master.<br>  <br>  The master said: "You are full of fear, and you sword is dulled by your weak will. When protecting someone, you think: 'I'm afraid to let you get hurt.' When defending you think: 'I'm afraid to get hurt', and when attacking you think: 'I'm afraid to do harm.'"<br>  <br>  Then he said this: "You sword is weakened by your dull will: When protecting s precious person you must think: 'I WILL NOT let you get hurt'. When defending: 'You WON'T hit me.' and when attacking: 'I WILL CUT you!'"<br>  <br>  This is the very contrast between a person of weak will and a prson of strong will who is not willing to compromise himself to make other feel better especially when they are malaffecting him.<br>  <br>  You need: STRENGTH, RESOLVE, and CLARITY of CONSCIENCE. Ascertain that before you attack, you have NO FAULT.<br>  <br>  Then you will have a free mind to attack with FULL resolve.<br>  ==|`|lBEKBw8Vaa	You're talking about school right? if nothing else works, try and change schools.|`|E3yOmel9aa	If you can, join a martial arts program.

It is important that men show themselves to be mult-faceted and not unilateral in their thinking.  Sure, you would probably "qualify" as a feminst.  But you can be sympathetic to some, many or even most of their tenets without aligning yourself with the movement.

I mean the kind of pseudo-masculinity that equates manhood with killing, self-destruction and exploitation of the weak. There is a true masculinity that is not destructive to women and children and helps run the community and the nation for the benefit of all.

I went through many phases where I became destructive to myself and others. I still go through phases and will never be the same and neither will his family or anyone in  that chain he affected.

5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	If a woman (or man) said she (or he) was possessed by satan, the majority of authorities would consider her (or him) mentally insufficient, and unable to give consent. If a man wanted to have sex with someone who was mentally unstable, the unstable person can't give consent, so if he forced himself on a mentally disturbed woman (or man) he would not only be a disgusting vile person, but would be a rapist. Sex=Informed consent Rape=Consent not possible <br>  <br>  I'm guessing that since rape is such a funny topic to you, that you haven't been raped yourself, and it's something you enjoy laughing about at work and with your friends?

With the previous answers giving.<br>  <br>  1. She can't know that she is possessed, only an outside observer can determine if she was, since if satan did exist, satan would of hidden his tracks.  <br>  <br>  2.  If you knew she was possessed, it would not since technically she is still in control of her body, just influenced to an extreme point.  <br>  <br>  3.  She can't be mentally ill from just being possessed.  However making the claim over and over that she was shows that she is mentally disturb.  But if other higher thinking functions work and she is able to make other consent types of thought, then no she is able to give consent and it is not rape.<br>  <br>  4.  Lastly, if she even made such claim at the police station or sort.  It would be noted but not acted upon since it would be signs of an effort to lie and cheat the legal system.  She still would get help for the alleged claim of being possessed.  But to use such of an excuse to get somebody charge for rape is a mentally disturb condition and it very wrong.  Again it to use that is a point blank outfaced lie and the person making such claimed should be sentence in prison for wasting the legal systems time.  Refer yourself to  (1.)  if you asked why.
952dTz5Taa	I have been the young pretty new girl at the office a number of times. It is too easy to get the attention of some of the male colleagues. Other women see this, and know it all too well, and instead try to relate to you as an impartial professional in the manner that they assume for their hierarchy at the office. If you don't respond with respect, then you're out in the cold. If you act weird to other women, you're freezing.<br>  <br>  Now that I'm older and see younger women gravitating to the fawning men, I know it all too well. I have no reason to fawn to this girl.

I'm sad for her... but let's get down to business and not pretend to be friends.<br>  <br>  If she can grow up and handle it, and learn to treat other women with more respect, then she may go further.

That's life too.<br>  <br>  There's always good and bad people, and the ones in between. <br>  <br>  Hopefully the girl is strong enough to not let it get to her and just enjoy her job and the people there who she is friendly with. As long as everyone doesn't hate her, then I doubt it's her and it's just these catty broads with nothing better to do than be ***** to her.|`|wkjncmHTaa	We aren't, generally. I find the women I interact with on a day to day level to be mostly very pleasant and friendly.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Jealousy. I feel ashamed and embarrassed sometimes when I witness how some women can behave towards one another.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Those females in your office are women not girls.   I would ask a few questions:  Have you bothered to ask any of the other women to lunch?   How does she treat those women?|`|cf105WLxaa	Most likely it's insecurity. If you are confident, there is no reason to behave this way.|`|RpHewn8gaa	Women are like children, only slightly taller.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	One word:Competition.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	It's a lack of confidence.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	She's not a "girl", you are men and women in the workplace, and it isn't a social outing, it's your job. If she's performing her job correctly and her supervisor has no problem with her work performance then the rest is just crap and who cares. BTW women are not hostile to each other, I have a very strong feeling that this woman is not doing her job and is pissing off the other women by trying to slide by on being cute instead of doing her work. For all you know she is putting more work on their desks because she isn't pulling her weight.  I've seen it way too many times, the cute newbie playing up to the guys and flirting and meanwhile not keeping her mind on her job where it belongs - that is why she is there, to work and produce quality work - and nothing else.

b76781d65df747aaaba9b8c020b060e0aa	You may have a crush on someone, but you don't want to admit it. There is someone else that you like, but you want to do the right thing because you have a girlfriend. There are a bunch of people interfering because they probably are telling you that your girlfriend that you have right now is the best, and you may not agree with them. You love your girl friend, but you feel like there is something missing. So you "imagine" someone else who can make you feel attraction for them.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion; only you know the real answer.|`|pU97DEjNaa	You probably eat heavy food in the evening|`|6rJj1wH3aa	If you are eating chocolate before you go to bed it can cause messed up dreams, if not you probably are just a horny kid.
CxoogGzxaa	I haven't found any either. It probably just isn't published online. <br>  <br>  By the way, I don't live in the UK, and I can't see the video.
GfG6wupTaa	Take a Xanax.|`|7be28e60733d4949a504d63eb8e45152aa	Put some music on or tv, and play a game online. Keep yourself busy, honestly if you take a walk through of your house.  Even though you are freaking out and just tell yourself "see i am home alone things are good none is here".  Remember that homes need to settle and depending on how old your house is, you will hear noise.  Last night we had winds soooooo gusty that my bed literally would shake from the wind going through the Attic.|`|QGuxbItCaa	Hit the folk's liquor cabinet. Look for the vodka.|`|AC0yjVJjaa	Enjoying Feb. Vacation?  lol, well anyways, get out doors.  I don't know if you live in snowy areas, but anyways hang with friends.  Have them come over.  Or you can just watch T.V. or play video games.  That may calm you down.|`|MlhiDi8paa	The sounds can be from mice, wind or just the temprature changes that make the building expand or contract.<br>  Just put on all the lights and listen to some loud music or watch loud tv to destract you.<br>  It will be fine. :)|`|zyGyT5gWaa	call someone and talk to them on the phone|`|W8xQKafjaa	take a hot shower, close your eyes and focus on your breathing... make some hot tea or hot chocolate and sip it slowly. Maybe turn on the TV low volume so you can have some background noise...
WkYOTRLqaa	It isn't that music effects people in ways that it changes their behavior but that people chose music that fit their behavior.  It is a temporary, slight alter that "changes" us (which we chose according to our personalities).  <br>  <br>  During school shootings people will look at the shooter's lifestyle and point out what type of music he listened to, or what kind of video games he played etc, etc.  But there are thousands of other people who listen to the same music and play the same video games or watch the same tv shows or whatever that would never do the same.|`|XsqQHKk0aa	I myself am what you call a youth and yes music really has changed my outlook on life as a whole. Without music my life would be nothing. The artists today write lyrics they think that kids can relate to, but really sometimes its offensive. You just have to find the right music in my opinion. And music alfters their outlook on life,yes, but what kind of music and what kind of kid? Now, you could be talking about some kid who grew up in Brooklyn or another who grew up in the posh neighborhoods of Westchester. It really depends on location. People listen to music based on what they like, their preferences. So music can alter their life, as long as they like it. But let me share something with you: it really has altered my outlook on life. Pop in my favorite cd when I'm feeling down and I might just cheer right up. Somedays I get so upset to where I dont feel like I want to live anymore, but I hear the words to my favorite song and I change my mind and keep on living. <br>  Hope you make this a best answer =)<br>  Good luck with your survey
A2G9foewaa	Your not over him.  Here is a good way to check if you are over him.<br>  <br>  Step 1:  look under you<br>  Step2:   is he there?<br>              If he is not then you are not over him|`|utGddhnVaa	I just had a dream about my ex... I think it just happens|`|CDkUMzzCaa	My be he's hauting u.|`|Wpulf29Maa	It's because you're still madly in love with him. You miss him so much and you want to be with him so badly....that's why he's in your dreams. You're heart wants to be with him....that's why you're dreaming about him.....to think about him.|`|fF9uTSmpaa	Yu said it yurself . Yu think bout him all day.

And I also believe that yu miss himnmmmmmm!|`|SjNthuBzaa	loove|`|laVR7f1Faa	It could mean that you are missing seeing that person just his or her face. Nothing more nothing less. AI still dream of my ex husband as well as high school boys I thought was cute just keep dreaming it is fun. Go to your local library and check on books about dreams they can tell you what most dreams are like. Keep dreaming kid and have fun|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Bc you are still in love with him and you don't have closure with him. You are thinking about him a lot, so its only natural you would dream about him too|`|tACp8AI5aa	Even u broke up, u can't even forget the feeling...<br>  there's some feeling that was buried in ur heart<br>  but thats ok, not a big deal actually<br>  u cant avoid it too =\|`|jaOEtAHKaa	Courtesy true love|`|rBFVAdOQaa	cause you probably still have feelings for him and maybe dont know it. or do?|`|3wYb6bfiaa	maybe its because you miss him. maybe you dont but kinda do|`|EH7G8voyaa	Mine does too.

When you were with him, its kinda like you were'nt so thinkative about it...now that your not with him, your mind is just remembering him and everything, i mean you were with him for a while...|`|hmrtS8GIaa	sounds like you have unresolved issues with your ex , if he doesn't want to talk about these problems you have with him that's ok , but you should still be allowed to tell him what they are.<br>   Maybe write him a letter or an email telling him you need to get this off your chest and say what you need to.|`|est2Sryhaa	get back together :) *couldnt be bothered to read the whole thing...* :D:D:D:D: its obvious you still have feelings, and if you had a reason to be together in the frist place then why not... just start meeting up  abit more as friends,..he'll get the hint <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|lgjVpYZEaa	Because subconsciously you're thinking about him.|`|Tw7o2Uagaa	WALL OF TEXT.|`|WZZ4mIayaa	cause you want him back :D|`|b76781d65df747aaaba9b8c020b060e0aa	I am no dream interpretator, but I usually have dreams about my ex boyfriend too. Sometimes things that should of happened during the relationship doesn't, so you end up dreaming about what you would have wanted.<br>  <br>  Also, I realized that in your description, you stated that he plays the guitar, but he doesn't play it in real life. This to me means that there are still some things you do not know about your ex. You also stated in your dream that you and him were talking. Lack of communication and misunderstanding could have been what broke up the relationship.<br>  <br>  You don't neccessarily have to still be in love with someone to still dream about them. But sometimes our dreams tells us more about a person than actually being with them in real life.<br>  <br>  You also said you were trying out a new ride. Could this mean that you should try out a new means of communication or change the way you and your ex relate to each other? <br>  <br>  He was also there to protect you from the crash. The secret bathroom could be interpreted as the way to get to his heart. Thats why he has been so mean. But after you came out the secret bathroom, you learned something new about him. <br>  <br>  Some people appear to be mean, but that is just a protective shield so they won't get hurt. It's about trust.<br>  <br>  In time, your dream will make lots of sense. Get a journal and write down all the dreams you have had about your ex. See if there are any similarities or differences. You will eventually discover what is behind the dreams.<br>  <br>  Have faith. Good Luck!!!
8WbfmK5daa	Depends what you believe. There are various sides to this.<br>  <br>  Sigmund Freud once called dreams the “royal road to . . . the unconscious,” Meaning it is linked to a subconscious concern of yours.<br>  <br>  And then there are those such who accept the unconscious importance of dreams and yet see them as more than wish fulfillment; some find dreams to be valuable hints about how to improve our lives—and perhaps even keep us from foolish self-destruction.<br>  <br>  Then there are modern scientists who claim that dreams are nothing more than images resulting from random electrical activity in the brain as it “housecleans” itself during the night. (I agree with this theory).<br>  <br>  If you believe dreams predict future events or have a specific meaning then If you dream you are falling but you are not frightened or harmed shows that you will meet with adversity but overcome it with ease. If the fall greatly frightens you then you will under go a major struggle in life. If you are injured in the fall you will lose many friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  All depends on what you believe and the way you view it :)|`|x4xaqrpCaa	falling dreams can have  a symbolic or even literal significance, often indicating a feeling that life is spiraling out of control on some level or reminding us of a real physical danger. Falling dreams are an indication of insecurities, and anxieties. You are feeling overwhelmed and out of control in some situation in your waking life.
