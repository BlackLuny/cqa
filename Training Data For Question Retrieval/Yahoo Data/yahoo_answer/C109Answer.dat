GMYNuFCDaa	The Huffington Post? BUWAAAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA!|`|KgY4X4ccaa	So so sad.  The fact that the link is to huffpo doesn't change the fact that it happened.  Or that it was on video.  Or that the same exact story is on the front page of Politico.  But nevertheless, watch the cons bash the link.|`|IUw5Z395aa	THIS IS WHY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL LOSE THE NEXT FEW ELECTION CYCLES, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK|`|MEReSvZeaa	Why do you use the huffington post for information?    Don't you know your IQ drops the moment the first page opens?|`|Y6odIQgJaa	You nailed it!|`|s25Dh5RVaa	Haha Huffington Post. That "news" source is shlt. What a biased piece of crap.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	If people would stop talking about it, it would die down.    Rush is feeding off of this (and countless other things).  He's getting free press and a wet azz from the Republicans kissing it so much.    If he is their leader, we're all in big trouble.|`|cIHBpcREaa	Why do you get upset?  You've won so get over it.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I was going to read what you wrote, but say your source and that explained everything...the Post dude? Geez!|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	I think what's sick is how much focus is being paid to a radio host.  It's pathetic.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	Gingrey found out the hard way that Limbaugh is more popular than he is in his own home state.     Being in the capitol so long, he suffers from the government mentality that poisons peoples minds. By attacking Limbaugh he thought he was doing the right thing. It took a bunch of calls from voters to bring him back to earth.    No so great american writes: "So so sad. The fact that the link is to huffpo doesn't change the fact that it happened. Or that it was on video. Or that the same exact story is on the front page of Politico. But nevertheless, watch the cons bash the link."    Oh please. How often has your fellow liberals attacked someone for using Fox News, for example, as a source?|`|ovSkTNCoaa	Why should it bother you if Gingrey "kisses a 2-bit radio talk host's sorry Butt"? What are you afraid of Limbaugh for? There is only one president, not two. If Limbaugh and the republicans are so stupid, you should revell in it. It should make the republicans easier to defeat again in 2010, if you are correct. You and the libs are scared to death that this "stimulus" package won't and you can't pass it off on the House republicans.  "and by our estimate only $90 billion out of $825 billion, or about 12 cents of every $1, is for something that can plausibly be considered a growth stimulus."  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12331046...  Some $6 billion of this will subsidize university building projects. If you think the intention here is to help kids learn, the House declares on page 257 that "No recipient . . . shall use such funds to provide financial assistance to students to attend private elementary or secondary schools."|`|93HyAM60aa	Rush's talent is on loan from God ... he never claims to be one.     I thought by your rant that you had forgotten your medication. But the link to the Huffington Post explains everything.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	He is an idiot what more needs to be said.|`|2bx5l56caa	lol @ the huffington post    Stop huffing the reefer, you libs make me sick of this country|`|dJl0MLybaa	now we know why republicans can't win elections.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Well thanks for that very unbiased link to prove your point. By the way, are you about to receive your free loaf of bread from "the Messiah"?|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	Huffing and Puffington post? Ok, you caught us.

y0jL9n6Taa	Get your windows untainted and then go to court and explain (this is what would happen in a fix it ticket).  I wouldn't refer to the infraction as a "silly violation."  As an officer who has been shot at from behind dark tinted glass I take it way serious.|`|AA11098866	Your state should have a clear code of what degree of tinting is allowed for the safety of others.  You should check that before you tint your windows.  You should also check into that now before you try to fight an infringement you may be guilty of.
ycNxVrUfaa	I don't know enough about his politics but I would NEVER vote Palin.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Palin, definitely. I wouldn't vote for Jesse Jackson Jr. no matter who he was running against...if I opposed the Republican nominee as much as Jackson, then I wouldn't vote...or I would vote for an Independent candidate.|`|f7KKrMJvaa	Sounds great why don't we just start forming a huge line of idiot democrats to run for office all the way to 2050!!    Jesse Jackson is a fool|`|mgVrAqpkaa	all i can say if more some insane reason palin was nominee, i could/would not vote for her because i don't like or believe in her platform- that is all i can say until the time comes.|`|3zNIeEl2aa	Jesse jackson in 2016??? a long way to go. Everyone is not Obama. I don't particulary support him, But if the rep. present SarahPac... NOOOOOOOO!|`|H7ENkTxaaa	"I don't know enough about his politics but I would NEVER vote Palin."    Same here.|`|cfeda49d96a5a69cffa4dc367414bd82aa	i wouldnt be so sure about 2012  i dont se a re-election in the future  he is not doing so great already, he even has some dems mad at him|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I would say Sarah Palin since I haven't voted for a Republican for President since Ronald Reagan.|`|SR1Bc8tTaa	I would never vote for Sarah Palin as long as I live.  But I would reluctantly vote Jackson.  I don't trust him as he bid on Obama's seat.|`|Aw10iRBIaa	well since i do know something about both of their policies i would have to go with jackson, palin scares me, as a mother i'm sure she's fine but as a politician no way.|`|4Vmlf902aa	No I wouldn't vote for him, and if Obama's stimulus package fails you can bet Palin will win the 2012 election.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	I hope that doesn't happen - but it wouldn't be Jesse for sure - especially with the Blago ordeal.     You voted for Barry so why wouldn't you vote for Jesse - birds of a feather|`|lpwcqkNbaa	I would vote for the person with better policies regardless of political alliance|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I was tempted to say Jackson, because it would at least give one of the Jacksons and actual JOB, but Iwould vote palin!|`|AA10382849	Jackson is pathetic.|`|KOF2lcydaa	After Obama loses the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrecks the economy, and generally humiliates the nation.The Democrat party won't touch a black candidate for decades.
lU7jWzEJaa	That is some idiotic proposal.  No, a license should not be required for any of our amendments to be effective.|`|YtcmXVpWaa	Having to apply for a license is BS. It has no stipulation for licensing for gun ownership under the 2'nd amendment. Marshall Law and Tyranny is protected by all Amendments for the US citizen. They wrote in Ink, Not Pencil! There are no erasers. You compromise on any of them, you fortfeit your Freedom which was obtained with alot of bloody clothes, Cerbral comprehension, and time. Do not reverse it now.|`|hCr7Vlxkaa	Of course not. A license should not be required for any of those things.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	It violates the 2nd admendment and I sent $$$$ to the NRA to combat it!|`|U9XlITtHaa	It is unconstitutional but sadly is the epitome of this administration. (Biden authored the last 'assault rifle' ban) This is one of many unconstitutional laws that will be pushed through in the next four years.|`|OFGE01tRaa	No, that sucks.|`|TEsq9K54aa	No, I had not seen that; thanks for the link.    I was wondering where and when the first assault  would come ....very interesting that it's come out of IL.    Have you had any trouble buying ammo lately?  I'm not sure if the shortage (especially for .38s) is because of people rushing them or some "leaning" on manufacturers to slow production and/or distribution.  .|`|D7veyhF4aa	Rush used to be the "secretary of defense" for the Black Panthers. He has more guns than you could shake your stick at. He did time for gun crimes. His family's done time too.    The law's stupid. Rush is stupid. And the whole damn Brady Bunch is stupid.    The people of my country deserve better than this trash and all the other criminals turned politicians serving in Washington today.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	Wow! That is some stretch there Skippy. Guns, religion and free speech the same thing. Try again, but try to come up with something more persuasive. I think you may have missed on this one. I don't know that I agree with the premise of registering every gun owner, but I don't think your argument is very compelling.  EDIT: six thumbs down. Cling to those guns and Bibles...but don't be so bitter!|`|4zijn0cgaa	It will take more than a piece of paper to get my guns.|`|418d2e9812dceb72c6c1d038184e789baa	It violates the 2nd amendment. A higher court would strike it down.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	There is nothing in the 2nd amendment about not having licenses.  In fact is says "well regulated" right there in big print!  So I myself have no idea what the problem is unless you are a criminal.
rHwE5Rkbaa	Hey, nice to talk to you again!    No - it isn't normal except for officers.    Usually an enlisted guy or gal will go to their first unit and then go to "A" school in about a year - then transfer to their next base at that time (so you transfer twice in two years).  After that the usual tour is 3-4 years, unless you get advanced to Chief Petty Officer.  When you make Chief, in 99% of cases, you are transferred to a new unit - no matter how long you have on station.  Past that, it's still almost always 3-4 years until you retire.    There are only a couple of exceptions.  If you are at an isolated duty location (Attu, Alaska and Bahrain as well as some others), it is one year UNaccompanied... so no family the whole time.  However you get some free leave in the middle of the tour and some free leave afterward - and because of the hardship you just underwent, you will get whatever job you want after that tour.  Some senior positions are only for a couple years, but you will have at least 15 years before you ever get a chance to compete for those kinds of jobs.    And to disabuse you of your notions - if you really like the job, moving ever couple of years isn't so bad... and kids are resilient and can deal with moving better than adults (in most cases).|`|u8io9Ecdaa	It's more like 3-4 years, and sometimes you can get an extension for another year, a second tour, or transferred to another unit in or near the same location.  I grew up as a CG dependant, and I've raised 2 kids while on A/D.  Personally, I can't imagine living in the same town my entire life.  I grew up seeing different parts of the country and so did my kids.  Changing schools was hard, on the other hand I think it was advantageous in many ways.
c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	Nobody will be receiving checks. Those who work (and aren't claimed by someone else) will have their tax deductions reduced on their paychecks.  For singles, it will amount to either $19.23 or $25 per pay check, just enough for a decent or good bottle of booze every paycheck (depending on whether you get paid every other week or twice a month, if you get paid every week it will come to $12.50 per pay check).  For those who don't work, they will get the $500 (or $1000 for a couple) when they do their tax returns next year (not sure how that works).  Some people will actually ending up owing the governement $1000 next year (say if both members of a couple have their deductions adjusted so that they both have $1000 less deducted from their pay checks, that will be very funny next year).|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	ACORN is getting 5.2 Billion. How does that stimulate your economy?|`|otYOxmnuaa	no checks -- tax-credit.    It breaks down to $41.66 per month...BEFORE tax.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	It depends how you file your taxes...    If you claim 0 or 1 and are independent of your parent's finances, then yes you could be eligible for something (pro-rated for part time work). If you still file under your parents, then no... but theyd get a credit for you.|`|OxxrqzCzaa	They're trying to work out who will qualify for a stimulus check, but, based on last year's stimulus check, it sounds like you'd qualify, if I'm not mistaken...I'm waiting, like many others, to hear about that as well, I need the extra money to help support my family...|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Maybe you can find your name in the document. It's only 647 pages long:  http://www.rules.house.gov/111/LegText/1...|`|AA10755943	A lot of groups that are politically useful to Obama, like ACORN.

FGbAGa1Taa	he cannot retake the color blind test. If they let him, it wouldn't be fair to everyone who has gone through MEPS. I failed the depth perception test, and was told that if they let me retake it, they would have to let everyone retake it.     Maybe down the line after hes been in for a few years and was cross training, he would prob retake it then, but not now.    If he hasn't signed his contract yet, its okay about the transcripts. I am not talking about the contract to get into the DEP, I am talking about the contract he will sign with his recruiter, stating when he leaved for basic, his job, and his enlistment length.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	I don't think being color blind will disqualify your son from military service it will just narrow his job possibilities. He can retake the test and if he passes will be allright. If he fails again, then his jobs will be limited. If he hasn't signed anything yet, then the college transcripts issue can be fixed before he signs his enlistment contract.|`|v0ZvjE0Iaa	If he can get his transcripts before his next visit, they will put him up to an E-2. Same thing happened to me actually.|`|xL9EpNctaa	There is no cure for color blindness and can be a disqualifying factor for military service. You can obtain official transcripts in a matter of days, just call the college registrar office|`|sgEloO1Jaa	as long as he has corrected 20/20 vision it shouldnt be a problem getting into the military. however, color blindness can keep you from getting certain jobs. and unfortunately he will need to actually be DQ'd to retake the colorblind test and it will be a long miserable process. i have perfect vision but failed my depth perception and i wanted to retake it because it was early in the morning and my eyes were tired but they said tough luck|`|izWi8hfjaa	Thats a pretty good score actaully, I have a buddy who cant pass the test for the likes of him, but I guess military isnt his line of work.

That doesn't count does it???|`|noo8vpvzaa	That was just BS he spouted to get elected...Like pretty much everything he said...Ex: "No lobbyists in MY white house!", then he put 33 of them in his cabinet.    There is no such thing as a Democrat who doesn't love PORK...Well, I guess this proves he isn't a Muslim, huh?|`|p9rbEdpdaa	Sorry Queen, you were listening to the other guy...The loser, McCain who was making such a big deal out of  "pork" It just happens what is pork to me may be a necessity for you, but rebuilding our infrastructure after pretty much totally ignoring it since the Reagan years is something we all sorely need.  So yes, building a bridge for me is pork to you and building a bridge for you is pork to me, but if we ever visit each other, we will need both of the "pork barrel" projects.
bXR0qdLSaa	lmao good question. Americans in general have embraced Obama as President and want him to do whats the best for this country|`|uXVbvEX3aa	Free speech at Obama's inauguration? If anybody had said something dissenting, they would have been lynched.    "We all need to see just how deranged and sick these xenophobes actually are. So, let's see how much hate you can spew."    Xenophobia and racism are nothing more than a natural instinct for self-preservation, and it's one instinct I'm not stupid enough to let go of.

Or maybe you just watch Fox News...|`|AA10032971	I am sure that President Barack Obama can not 'walk on water.' I know that he is brilliant. Come on now, he already started being what a President of the United States is to be, at the moment he was elected in November 2008. His actual legal worktime just began on January 20, 2009 at the hour of noon. He has already surpassed 'our hopes' by beginning to work way before time. I know that he is sincere and I am banking on him continuing to do well. Peace!|`|IUw5Z395aa	Unless the U.S. radically changes the way it approaches the minority demographic, it's bound to go down the drain once they become a majority, consequently more money must be allocated towards programs that attempt to balance out the resources between Whites and everyone else|`|Gr99OjQuaa	you do realize that women are considered a minority and women outnumber men 2 to 1 or 2.5 to 1...  please link your source as well|`|IasHMWM2aa	Because that is a false statistic.|`|VK0brk89aa	Why would Obama want to drop his smoke and mirrors routine?|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	idk why hasnt he pointed that out?|`|KOF2lcydaa	Look on the bright side.

None.|`|kHx1upOpaa	if so who cares, i guess you think its all about the uncolored people and should be that way all the time and forever, since we are not real americans. Get a life you are European not Native, you are the first illegal immigrants. When are you going to deport yourself it has been hundreds of years and you are still here.|`|AA12262106	I'd like to see backup for that statement. I don't how you could possibly justify that statement.    Anyway there's two points that I would like to make assuming that the statement you made is true.  1) If minorities are to get 60% of the stimulus money ( your point being that more minorities will be getting the money) then it stands to reason that more minorities require financial assistance. That means that your country doesn't treat minorities as well as other people. You should be ashamed and fully support any measure to make the playing field even.  2) The huge amounts of money going to Freddie and Fanny, as well as the carmakers isn't going to minorities... it's going to fatcats that mismanaged resources. As far as I'm concerned these CEO's and other well paid crooks should be jailed, not have further money given to them to continue lining their pockets.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	60%. That's easy.

T0pkW783aa	No, I would not like to apologize to any terrorists.  We should be apologizing to all the victims of terrorists for the insanity in closing Gitmo, giving privileges to those who want nothing more than to kill us and many others, and to the military who provide these animals with food, clothing, politically correct literature and music (and air conditioning!!)  What a life!!  Set out to kill us and you can live like a king in our prison (sort of luxurious compared to what they would get at home), have legal representation and a bunch of libs feeling that those poor terrorists are being mistreated.  No, no apologies, thank you and no releases to have them turn around and join forces to do more damage to us.  We need to get a backbone, get back the rights to spy and get information to protect this Country.  Does anyone feel as if they would do the same for us??  . . . and those idiots who put our military on trial for offending them because they were naked or had undies on their heads???  They cut our heads off when they get annoyed, for God's sake!!  Some people need to reevaluate and consider what they are doing!!|`|cgb4WOnVaa	Yes.

The currently-proposed stimulus package includes hundreds of millions of dollars for seemingly unrelated projects, like $50 million for the National Endowment of the Arts and repairs to the Smithsonian museum totaling $150 million.  Other spending measures in the bill earmark over $330 million to programs that educate teens about STDs and sending $600 million over to NASA to study climate change.  Additionally, the bill would use $200 million to cosmetically improve the National Mall in Washington D.C. and budget $670 million to maintain and rebuild restrooms and other buildings in our national parks.

AA10123414	"if i owe a company money from a written contract," - Yeap, if the amount is small enough. Otherwise it goes to regular court.    "If so and i do not show..." then you lose by default regardless if you owe or not. They will get a judgment against you from the court. Depending on state law they will file claims to garnish your wages, seize bank accounts etc to settle the debt.|`|z88IMXNFaa	If you owe money, they can sue you in small claims court if the amount is small enough, or in civil court.  If you do not respond to the complaint, a default judgment will be issued against you.  While this will allow the company to garnish your wages, seize your bank accounts and lien your property, it will also be valid for many years (20 in some jurisdictions) and it accrues interest at better than market rates.  Some companies are just sitting on judgments and letting them earn interest at 9 or 12 or 13% for a few years before beginning to collect it.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	If it is a small amount like a rental car or something like that, it will go on your credit record.|`|AA11098866	You signed a written contract.  If it is going to small claims court, it is beyond a collection agency.  They can obtain a verdict to garnish your wages, obtain the money from your bank account, whatever means necessary.

Get a clue.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	No.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Real conservatism is not intolerant.  But since Nixon's 'Southern Strategy' in 1968, the Republican party has encouraged and exploited not just racism but every other kind of intolerance.  Homophobia, nativism and xenophobia, even religious intolerance.  They've gotten votes from their target demographic by promising them they don't have to compete with 'the other' for jobs, schooling, etc.    This is not anything to do with conservatism, only with Republican partisan politics.  But just in recent years this has slowed down somewhat, as Republicans have realized the number of 'minorities' is growing in some states they need to win.  The southwest, for instance, will soon be >1/3 Hispanic, and the Republicans see they can't afford to write these people off.  And the number of blacks in some areas is growing to the point where they are becoming a factor, plus blacks and Hispanics are voting in unprecedented numbers.  So in the last couple of elections, Republicans have tried to reach out to these minorities in particular.  So far, though, not many of them have been fooled.    Gays are still a safe target for intolerance, at least for now, which is why in recent years they've stepped up their attacks on them.|`|oYaGeDewaa	no i don't think so is f.u. a code for dumb uneducated bigot|`|AXNkmdbKaa	What color people?

Basically, people that work hard to better themselves are conservatives and people who like welfare and handouts are liberals.  We would not have so much libbys if the hippies from  the sixties didn't invade the teaching sector the last few decades.  My whole way through college all I got fed was that Liberal adgenda and I just graduated two years ago and work and pay taxes and have a family I support, as well as probably a few welfare people.  That is why I am conservative.      For recent high school and college graduates, here is a list of 11 things they did not learn in school.     In his book, Bill Gates talks about how feel-good, politically-correct teachings created a full generation of kids with no concept of reality and how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.     RULE 1......Life is not fair; get used to it.     RULE 2......The world won't care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.     RULE 3......You will NOT make 60 thousand dollars a year right out of high school. You won't be a vice president with a car phone, until you earn both.     RULE 4......If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure.     RULE 5......Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping; they called it opportunity.     RULE 6......If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them.     RULE 7......Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try "delousing" the closet in your own room.     RULE 8......Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools they have abolished failing grades; they'll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.     RULE 9......Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summer off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.     RULE 10.....Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.     RULE 11.....Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one.    BTW I did athletics to get through college and graduated with a pretty good degree.|`|jauizC6Vaa	No. How on earth can you ask such an ignorant question? That's a rhetorical question by the way.|`|f36a70ysaa	no, we like people to take responsibility for their own actions and lives, no matter what race, country of Origin or sexual preference.|`|8lzCc0Sdaa	No the word is liberal or people that want to steal from hardworking people to give it to any skin colored person that does not deserve it.  "We must continue to enable the lazy" This should be the cry of the non conservatives!  The people schools and groups that give indoctrination/education, $ and jobs to people of certain races as long as they are not considered White are the racist. Try to take a deep breath and be open minded and objective is it not racist?  FACT: A TRUE African American won a scholarship, BUT because his skin was white it was taken from him.  Is it not sexist to not hire women for certain jobs or careers? But then why is it not sexist to refuse to hire men for certain careers in health care?|`|Fmo4ZgYjaa	Anti-colored is your code word for white people, lol.  You want to hear another racist code phrase.  "people of color".  It is an exclusionary term to mean "everybody on the planet EXCEPT one race".  How much more racist can you get.  Anyone who uses the term "people of color" is a racist by definition, because they try to seperate the races.

NC-120 Order to Show Cause for Change of Name   NC-130 Decree Changing Name. Use a separate form for each child.

diCASlUXaa	Why is this question directed towards liberals?  Both parties are in favor of teaching students about the constitution and bill of rights.    anyhow:   We should learn about them so we know what our rights are and we can apply them to real life situations.  For example; 1st amendment: freedom of speech.  We need to know that we have the right to say whatever we please,  but we also need to know about the exceptions;  freedom of speech as long as it doesn't impose on the physical safety of others, like for example you can't yell "fire!" in a crowded place under false pretences.

If not, I'll probably vote for the GOP candidate.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	I will NEVER vote for him. I don't care if people are intimidating me to vote for him. He will never know of any support from me.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Only if he was running against Jessie Jackson|`|YupMCYHlaa	A better question would be: If you voted for him this time, and nothing changes, would you vote for him again?  Or, even better: If you voted against him this time, but he does a really good job, would you vote for him in 2012.    When you ask any question about Obama you get a lot of answers from people who just think he's the worst kind of crook and fraud. They didn't vote for him this time, and they really don't care whether he does a good job or not, they're going to vote Republican next time, and in the meanwhile they'll repeat all the negative things they hear about him, true or not.    If you discount those people, I think there are much fewer people who are just awed by the Obama persona and don't care whether he does a good job or not, they'll vote for him as many times as he runs.    Finally, you get to the intelligent people who might have voted for him or might not, but are waiting to see what kind of job he does.  Put me in that category.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Never will I vote for that man.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	I probably won't vote for him no matter what|`|AA12201622	No !!! But  He will declare Himself king soon|`|diZoW49Zaa	No.|`|SSLekPAnaa	No|`|GJFBsG62aa	Well, in his first week at President he's accomplished more than Bush did in a month.

Its all starting out the same.     The way he offers change, and tells people how he can turn the country around is alot like how Hitler came to power. But after offering all the change, and making people believe him, he abused his power, and started turning into a dictator.   Since the U.S. has been in a recession, the economy is willing to do anything for change, and President Obama is offering a way out for the american people, but in the long run,will he abuse his power?  It seems people are backing his every move, without thoroughly thinking it through. HItler also preached he was the better change, and he would bring Germany out of the recession. He would tell the people of Germany he means well, but really he was planning to abuse his power as a ruler of Germany, making him a dictator.|`|AA10919865	NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS    ID RATHER MOVE TO CANADA...

I would more than likely vote third party.  So, far, he's done a good job with keeping his campaign promises (closing Gitmo, taking steps to pull out of Iraq, working hard with Republicans on the stimulus) so, he might get it.  2012 is still a long way off, though.|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	Hell, I didn't vote for him the last time, so why would I vote for him if nothing changes?|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Why would I vote for him if not much has changed?

The twin towers was already built again before it was destroyed.    So I dont see a point is my tax dollars going to rebuilding something that will end up being destroyed again|`|kuIKAGkeaa	nahhhhhhhh, if they do re-build it, it will be a great historical moment though.  A good legacy for obama is simply doing his best, even though many are against him and vice versa.  Nobody will be 100 percent satisfied with his decisions, he cant please everybody, just like Teddy Roosevelt didnt please everybody, but we can hope he does his best|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	It should've been rebuilt under B00sh but now that economy is bad, I don't see how it will be relevant.

For what all of NYC (and the rest of the country) I would not want to take any more chances.  I walk past where the buildings used to be every day and I would rather it be a memorial than a new building.  Every time I walk past it, I think about what happened that day and I would want future children to be able to acknowledge what happened.  If a new building was built, I do not think it would have the same effect.    I think the best thing Obama can do is live up to our expectations, as he is already doing.  Just think how much an impact will be if he ends the war!  It will go down in history and I would rather the war be over than for him to re-build a building.  I do not think that he needs to re-build the Twin Towers to achieve greatness.  He is already wonderful in my eyes.
8rGZFBKOaa	Obama's plan? You mean his first "stimulus" plan with 80% pork? You mean with pork he said was "over" from his administration on and yet............. voila' here we have MAJOR pork.

All of these things happened on their watch 9/11,Iraq,Afghanistan,Katrina,Financial meltdown,Housing crisis, and that is just the short list.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	they won't look half as bad as they would if they roll over for Obama's administration (again) and vote against their principles of having controlled spending and a fiscally responsible government.  I am wondering right now if this is why the Republican candidate for President failed so badly.  He had a chance to stand up to that coward Obama and instead, he shrugged his shoulders and voted for Bush's bailout.  Now McCain is doing an about-face, but it is too late.  The rest of the Republicans, now leaderless without Bush, are just letting the dems run their lives and have proven that they never had principles to begin with, or courage of any kind.    I think if the Republicans do not oppose this plan, they can not only kiss our financial freedom goodbye, but any chances that they would have in 2012.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	They will all take credit regardless.|`|wULUGKzVaa	Not bad at all and fortunately, we'll never have to find out.

Get a grip dude and maybe a 12 step group.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	bush's bailout was a knee jerk decision to help the banks and we dont even know what they did with the money    Obama's plan is well thought out, we know it will create jobs and provide tax cuts to regular Americans. and, recovery.gov will tell us where every penny is being spent|`|jauizC6Vaa	How do you like the idea that over $12 million of that pork is designated for ACORN even though they are being investigated in 12 states? That's the kind of crap pork hidden in this joke of a "stimulus package. We're in deep feces.|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	The first TARP that Bush and Paulson were responsible for will at least come back to the Federal treasury.  That was $350 Billion.  It was used to buy preferred stock and actual assets in banks.  It will be re-paid and will likely even increase in value.    This could actually prove to be a decent investment in America.  The government can begin to sell those assets as soon as the economy stabilizes and turns around.    The problem is that Obama was in charge of the second TARP.  If he screws up, we are TOAST.  Now with this so-called "stimulus" package, we may be screwed completely.    By the time Bush left office, there were a couple of signs that things were beginning to turn around.  No longer.  The "stimulus" package is tax-and-spend legislation that will kill the economy.  That's why there have been all the layoffs.  The "stimulus" kills private sector jobs to pay for government "employment."   It takes from the people who produce to give to those who don't.  Simple fact of economics.    You are totally right about "executive compensation."   It's a drop in the bucket compared to the BIG numbers but it allows the Democrats to continue their class warfare and get votes.    BTW, not a SINGLE Republican voted for the so-called "stimulus" package in the House when it passed this afternoon. Not one.  The Senate will start debating their version on Monday.  It's even MORE money.  If it passes, there will be a conference committee to reconcile the two versions.  Look for LOTS more fireworks by mid-February.|`|WbOcDjfeaa	Neither will serve their stated purpose, the only difference I see is that the Obama stimulus bill is a thinly veiled pork fest.|`|IYZJZLUIaa	The first $700 billion was a last minute hail-mary pass for the economy as the markets began plummeting. President Bush was just trying to save face, because he didn't want the complete collapse of the markets on his watch to go down in history like that. So he signed a $700 billion bailout in order to free up the frozen lending markets and get credit flowing again. Which didn't really work all that well.     Now this $887 billion (plus interest) "stimulus" plan is just an excuse for Democrats to spend spend spend. They have a HUGE majority in Congress and they are taking advantage of that in order to fulfill their huge government spending wishes. They refuse to listen to the Republicans (who fixed it when FDR messed up and AGAIN when Jimmy Carter messed things up) who are calling for huge tax cuts. They just want to spend a lot of money and get rid of the private sector. I mean look at this:     - $650 million for Digital TV coupons   - $600 million for global warming research (plus $1.4 billion for "other" climatology things)   - $20 million for contraceptives that was just removed because of the complete idiocy of it all.   - $30 million for new federal government vehicles    This is insane. Call your senator and complain.    Congressional Democrats claim that this will create jobs. That there will be tax cuts "included" in the bill. Which is awesome, but the Congressional Budget Committee is saying that this stuff won't really give a "jolt" to the economy like messiah Obama said it would. The Republican plan costs the American people about half of what the Democrats are voting on as we speak, and will be injected into the economy within 2 years! And create 6.4 million new jobs!     Meanwhile the value of the dollar goes down as the Fed keeps printing money. This is what happens when Dems are in control.
AA11369432	No, Just shopping..trying to find the best buy.|`|kX4JPvwwaa	To be a bit frank, I'm pissed about this stimulus bullsh*t, and I even voted for Obama.  That's not to say I wish I'd voted McCain.  Both parties are doing essentially the same sh*t, passing bills for enormous "economic stimuli" that are filled with pork for their constituents.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Not really, - uit means we are going to take a bunch of your money and blow it on stupid ****|`|cIHBpcREaa	Exactly and most of them will approve of it except some who still have a little sense in them.|`|u23sBafTaa	You got it ! Obama and the liberals are going to beautify D.C. so they have a nice place to party.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	I wouldn't count so much on the "clearn up" of government as much as it is creating more government intervention in our lives and the expanding of Government.  Here we are in a downturn of the economy and 3 sectors still inproved......all 3 being sectors of the government like education.  Look at how much we pay to kids per capita, and compare how much other states have. All the states with the highest capita money per kid have the lowest test scores. Meanwhile the moron politicians think that we should throw more cash at the problem. Sheer stupidity.  Its time to stop pampering these kids and start demanding they start performing. 1/2 of the illegals drop out. Here the bleeding hearts are wasting the taxes of the citizens to educate people that shouldn't even be here legally, and most drop out. Those that are passing aren't efficient at reading. Time to get down on the people that think they have the right to tell us where to use out taxes and kick them in the rear for wasting it. They are part of the reason we are in this downturn.  This isn't a stimulus bill...........its a pork bill from hell. Less than 1/3 of it has any connection to helping the economy.
4IOPe5ziaa	For an oath to be valid it must be administered by someone with the authority to administer oaths, an appeal to God to witness the truth or sincerity of what is being sworn to, and an outward sign such as raising of a hand or placing it on a Bible.  As far as the law is concerned, he met all of the requirements.    An affirmation requires all of the above, minus the appeal to God.  It is just as binding.|`|eulMjLtPaa	He didn't take the oath twice to be "sincere," he did it to avert any stupid legal challenges.|`|bXn6WGaXaa	This is something I have never been able to understand. Why would we make this huge flap over the separation of church and state, and then have the president sworn in on the Holy Bible? If the man making the oath does not hold the Bible in reverence, what difference would it make? I think Saul Alinsky's "Rules For Radicals" would be a far better choice for this president anyway.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Doesn't matter... It would mean nothing to a muslim..|`|otYOxmnuaa	That's Change I can believe in!    What kind of stupid superstition is it that by placing your hand on the bible it gives your word some credence and legitimacy.    I'd just prefer these guys affirmed they're telling the truth...and then hold them accountable.|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Because having a President sworn in does NOT require a hand on a Bible. The oath, per the US Constitution, is as follows:    I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."      As a matter of fact, MANY US presidents have been sworn in with no book or some book other than the Bible. I, for one, am glad he didn't use a Bible the second time. Religion has no place in political ceremonies.  Note also there is no "so help me God" required by the Constitution. Some Presidents have added that as tradition and/or personal preference.|`|87CAVhs2aa	Well, he doesn't need to have it.  My mom didn't use the bible when she was sworn into town council. I wouldn't have my hand on the bible.    Anyway, I don't think a book should really matter about whether or not someone is fit to rule.    That's just me.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	he did.  the same bible Lincoln was sworn in under.|`|8A0JdS7Xaa	It wouldn't impress me any more than having his hand on Aesop's Fables or Lord of the Rings.|`|645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	he should have grabbed his crotch ....|`|wIZNsqG1aa	It sure makes you wonder what was really in that yellow box doesn't it.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	To appear more sincere?  You don't think he sincerely wanted to be president?  Other presidents such as Teddy Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and John Quincy Adams didn't use a bible when being sworn in so I don't see why it should be an issue now.|`|tJzlPhm5aa	well considering this was his SECOND time around he figured he would do anyway he wanted too.  I am not looking for anything that he does during his time in office to be "right"|`|zoPyYyXHaa	I heard that they could not find one in the White House. The Bush family took theirs with them.

D9x1QSgiaa	I was in the USAF Security Forces (formerly known as Security Police) from 1977-1982. At that time you had to get special permission from the company commander to attend Sniper School conducted at Ft. Benning, GA. If you didn't already have the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship award from Basic Training you were not selected for the school. If you volunteered for T.N.T. (Tactical Neutralization Team) your chance of being selected was good. You had to have your 5 level (at the time it was AFSC 81150) and be Sr. Airman or above, and recommendations from your squad leader and flight chief.    The requirements for Military Working Dog school was similiar except you did not need the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship award or to be on T.N.T.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Any time after you get your 5 level.    Takes about 6 months after tech School to get your 5 level.    But don't hold your breathe.    Everyone wants those jobs.    Plus, you don't even know if you can shoot well enough yet.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	dude you have to talk to a recruiter about that. its a plus that you have a degree. i dont think anyone on this board can tell you for sure|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Actually the Air Force doesn't exactly have counter sniper. If you are actually looking to be a bad *** then go Navy Seals. As far as resumes are considered military experience is based on what your service record says at the end of your term. Not necessarily what branch looks better. I have worked with the Coast Guard Law Enforcements Detachments on deployments since I have been in the Navy and I gotta say they are a lot better at what they do then the Air Force. Worked with Air Force SF and those guys pretty much have no clue what they are doing. Had to constantly train them in the field. And they just really wanted to end the day earlier than anyone else. So if you are only going to choose one of those two then go for the Coast Guard.
dthWo7u6aa	you can obtain a copy of your birth certificate from the registrar of births and deaths in the town you were born, it will cost you a little but that will depend upon if you want a short or full certificate (full certificate costing a little more) it will be a certified and legal document.     If your parents don't want to give it to you then it may just be easier for you to go and get a copy. I don't think that you can force them by law, but it may be an idea to have a look on some deed poll websites to see if you can see if they have any advice... they are very helpful.|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) I think there is a VERY EASY & logical solution here, which is provided you know your date of birth & the precise place of birth. Then it should be extremely easy to go to the national archives i.e. the place of record keeping for births deaths & marriages and just get a copy of your own birth certificate.    **you might have to pay a small fee for doing this, for the printing off for example.    **people do this all the time its really not a big deal in its self.    **this would save any further conflict with your parents & prevent any more anger & upset.

Either way it is unimportant. You can go to the BVS bureu of vital statistics and get your own copy. They are usually less than $20.

Yes We all agree that abortion sucks But given the choice between having a fetus being aborted at ten weeks post- conception  or having that ten year old  abused child dying on the streets of starvation or violence  then abortion becomes the more humane alternative   I suggest that you leave your nice safe suburban home and that you go into the cities and start  laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go looking for the places only they would know.  Find those little kids that the misnamed pro-lifers so idealistically saved from getting aborted  ask them about their lives  and  how they got to where they are ,ask them why they weren't adopted as all you guys believe that they will inevitably be  .

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Unless he was charged with an attempt to commit some minor offense, the only way that there could be an 8 month prison sentence in California would be if it was a consecutive sentence.  Consecutive sentences are imposed as 1/3 the mid-term for the crime.  Since the maximum sentence is 3 years, it is certain that the mid-term is 2 years, and 8 months is 1/3 of that.  I think it pretty clear that the plea bargain was for a consecutive sentence.  Your friend may have misunderstood, but I think that the attorney correctly stated the agreement he had reached.    Oddly, in California a consecutive sentence can be the better deal.  For example, a defendant has a three year prison term, and has served a year of it.  If he gets a concurrent 3-year term on another matter, he will do another year after he completes the first term.  If he gets a consecutive 8-month term, he will do only 8 months.    There is no benefit, however, to a "nolo" plea.  The only use that such a plea has is that a "nolo" plea to a misdemeanor cannot be used as an admission in a civil case.  Since this is a felony case, there is no such benefit, even if there is some civil liability in the matter.  However, if other charges are being dismissed in exchange for his plea, that could still be a reasonable bargain.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	Boy that is going to be an awesome wedding, mullets and tattoos as far as the eye can see.  All the PBR you can drink and spam you can eat.|`|JHO6DlH0aa	Typically the plea agreement has been prepared in written form and is usually signed by the Judge during the hearing.  If there is a conflict between the record of the court and the written agreement it can be easily straightened out.  Also be aware that a Judge does not have to accept a plea agreement; although they usually do.  The "nolo" plea is the same as pleading guilty without accepting civil liability that may be attached to the crime.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Concurrently means that time served is applied and consecutively means it is added on. The ruling will go in to the books as read at the hearing. The only course of action you have is to go through the public defender. The public defender is also friends with the DA's office as they see the all the time so do not approach the situation with an attitude. THe public defenders goal is to get you off  his plate as is the DA's. THese are lawyers so you will need another lawyer to win out so do not upset the guy. Just go back to them and nicely explain that you will never give up on this until it is remedied and that you will call him each and every day for the rest of his life until is is remedied. You can get this out nicely if you prepare yourself. It may have been an oversightand may not have been I could not answer that but you need to stay on it if you want results. Just remember the expression more bees with honey.|`|ZzknHgU1aa	First, find out from the PD what the deal really is. This can be had with a phone call. Next, call the court clerk, and find out what the court file indicates. This may take some doing. The critical version is whatever the court file says. If it does not comport with your fiance's  understanding, tell him to 1) ask the judge at sentencing if he may ask a question of the court, and 2) make his understanding plain - on the record. Usually, a judge will ask if the defendant has anything to say before sentence is passed. Don't let this moment slip away. Good luck.
2OBP8fqJaa	It is considered illegal at your school, so carrying that, or an empty beer can could be considered closely the same. As adults we can get arrested for having an "empty container" in the car like a booze bottle or beer can. The implication is that it was consumed at that spot, inside the car. The same rule applies to your can of chew.    I would have to argue with lawyer dude. If the can had something else in it when it was found or confiscated, or the label was scraped off, it would have been a good argument. Keep this in mind if you do intend to hire a good attorney as the plaintiff will likely say that as well.|`|ncSd9jXDaa	they didnt want to think that you gave it to anyone.. that would be my guess.    that Fonz guy has a point, lol|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	How do you like the way the far left runs things? Remember that when you vote..|`|0nsfvY48aa	Do you usually make a habit of carrying empty cans in your pocket?|`|AA10783710	Is this really the whole story?    If it is.... then start doing the Snoopy supper dish dance, because you are in the driver's seat.    If you had no tobacco, then you broke no regulation.  The can is not tobacco.  The previous use of the can is inconsequential.  You could be using it to store something you don't want broken, something fragile.  You could say you used the can to store your Ipod and cell phone.    It is as ridiculous as a school banning cell phones, and then suspending someone who had a cell phone case, they used to protect a small calculator or something.    If they balk, threaten to take this to the media, and the school officials will be publically ridiculed.  The biggest guns of all are FOX News.  That loud mouth Sean Hannity would love a nonsensical story like this.    If you have more problems, write me.  I'd love assisting you beat these pinheads.    Don't go ballistic, but check your spelling of "completely" and "received".  Also, if you ever spell "separate" incorrectly, I'll suspend you myself.  Just kidding.  Good luck on this.|`|207dFmdHaa	talk to your principal calmly, tell him or her, just what you wrote here. tell them you dont want it on your record, and think that you were falsely accused....if that doesnt work, you could write a letter to your local newspaper and have do a story about it.|`|AWSmknxLaa	guilty as charged    Move on|`|UB5HxKtdaa	Calm down youll be fine.

Your suspension is perfectly legal.    Don't worry about your record. If you're chewing tobacco at 18 you're probably going to be dead of mouth cancer in a few years anyway, and then it will be no problem.    Richard|`|EVX17AjRaa	I think that's definitely unfair. But even if it was empty unless you washed it out there was probably some reminisce in the can that they could use against you. If your really concerned about it you could call a lawyer and just ask if you have any options. But I doubt you will be able to get out of it.|`|m5CiESVdaa	It is the "reasonable man standard" used in a court of law, U.S.A.:  If someone points a gun at you, the reasonable assumption is that there are bullets in it, and you will be shot, therefore, this means that   the would be shooter goes to jail, period. Same as with your empty can.  The reasonable standard assumes that the product was brought onto your campus, and used by you.  There is zero tolerance in schools today for this stuff.  Count yourself lucky that this will not hit court records.|`|QP7VyPV6aa	Most schools these days are "zero tolerence" zones. And usually they don't allow possession of tobacco products. Even if your can was empty, how do they know it was beforw you got to school? For what they know you brought it to school and emptied it by using the remainder at school.  So if u were aware they didn't allow tobacco on school grounds and you brought it, then you took the chance on whatever disciplanary actions they would take.|`|AA11098866	Point blank...  You possessed a tobacco item on school property.    Intent is not in question.  Your possession of the item is the problem.  And, no tobacco container is ever completely empty.

You cannot yell "fire" in a crowded theater when there is no fire and you cannot slander people.  You can't start a religion in which practice human sacrifice.  And so not even the 2nd Amendment is absolute.    My only problem with background checks is that they seldom do any good since very few criminals get their guns through legal means and the mental health records are seldom ever checked and even when they are, they tend to be very incomplete.    For anyone who wished to point to the number of people who's purchase was rejected due to a background check, you need to dig a little deeper.  The GOA says that well over half of the denials were due to clerical errors.  And the number of convictions is almost statistically non existent.    So if background checks are instant, and if they had a positive impact on reducing crime I would say they are reasonable.  However if they just cost taxpayer's money and have no impact on crime, which appears to be the case, then no, it is not reasonable.|`|AA10187742	Personally, I agree with background checks for weaponry purchases.|`|YnlT7m8raa	Simple answer: Which part of "shall not be infringed" is not understood?|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	Background checks by whom?  Are you implying that our politicians are qualified to determine whether we are suitable to own firearms?    According to our Constitution this is a Right, not a privilege to be dispensed by our public servants.  It is their job to remove criminals from our presence, not to judge us as to who is worthy.  We have government to protect our Rights, not to grant privileges.    If you shouldn't be armed, you shouldn't be on the street.  Obviously, small children need to be protected from firearms just as we protect them from sharp objects.  But the day we allow our elected public servants to judge us, rather than we judging them, we are inviting dictatorship.    It is up to our public servants to arrest and imprison criminals.  Who are they that we have to prove anything to them?  It is they who work for us.  If they are unable to get the criminal element off the street, then we need to replace them.|`|W2JUHdSfaa	uhmm the 2nd ammendment protects the right to have a gun  not to have one in total secrecy  also its not discrimination to not hire someone who owns guns|`|FaMDdmjwaa	I believe that background checks are a reasonable precaution to take before allowing someone to own a firearm. The second amendment is one of the most important in insuring the American people with the power to form a militia in case it is needed. There is also a drive for self protection. Some people also just like guns to hunt or shoot skeet/targets. A background check is something used to protect the other citizens of the state. Each citizen has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If a wanted criminal was allowed to buy a gun, it would be plausible that that would hinder other citizens of their right to life.

0szdPqI0aa	why should they?  the government denies a lot of things for good reasons.  Most of the movies and shows based on them aren't so accurate, but the books seem to be. especially the ones written by former Delta's.  But Delta is not your average conventional force.  Delta preforms missions like no other. things that you would think James Bond would do.  Delta preforms some of the most important , highest missions in the military. and those missions actually affect the US greatly.  its like why doesn't the CIA talk about their special units often. They have movies, books, etc about them, but the CIA never admits that.  thats because it gives a sense of secrecy, and even though we may know there are such units, we may not ever really know what they do.  who cares if the govt admits or denies them.. aslong as Delta keeps being Delta, thats all i care about.|`|AA10025824	There's no need for the government to confirm or deny more than just the Delta Force.

If the combat controller field interests you maybe you would consider being a "Pathfinder", they have some similar duties and my understanding is that the school is pretty challenging.

bXn6WGaXaa	If you don't know, you should. Churchill was an absolute disaster in peacetime, but served as a rallying point for all of Britain when things were their darkest. I would encourage you to do a little research and see what he did. The "...we shall never surrender.." bit comes from a speech he delivered after Dunkirk, before the House of Commons. It really is a moving seech, and delivered without the pretense and pandering so often found in modern political speeches. The following is a short excerpt, and goes to the heart of the matter.    "The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender" The entire speech is about ten times this length, but this is the part people remember.

1fxHHrWIaa	I think that Obama's decision to provide the first interview of his Presidency to the Muslim world speaks volumes of his character and makes me wonder how much of his hundreds of millions in campaign funding came from the Arab world. I have to wonder where his allegiances lie. He also chose to denounce an American talk radio show host before the real enemies of our nation, like Bin Laden and many others.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	It was a brilliant move... by treating Al qaeda and other extremists as political players her reduces their base of support in the arab/muslim world by showing how bankrupt their ideas are.    Like he said "What does Al Qaeda have to say about healthcare or education?"    A less informed person may see this as weakness, but anyone who knows how politics and the "bartering" culture of the middle east works knows this to be a stroke of genius.     The more friends we have over there, the safer we all are.  Coupled with that his escalation in Afghanistan and cross-border flights into the mountainous regions of Pakistan, Al Qaeda's days are numbered.|`|IYZJZLUIaa	I know (and ABC will claim that they were the ones to give him the first post-inaugural interview - bull).

iVv6bFW2aa	No, because the revenues generated should be used for social spending, which is greatly lacking thanks to Bush|`|eqDXoCeTaa	The stimulus package sucks.    What we should do is rely on the free market/capitalism.  We don't need the government to push us back even further.  Government causes these problems.    Bush tax cuts should be permanent.  That's a good start.|`|otYOxmnuaa	It does include tax-credits -- 300 Billion dollars.    Fall into a depression?  We're already there -- check the definition of economic depression.    What do we do?    1.  Tax cuts across the board is probably the best policy.    Obama said it himself -- the free-market is where jobs are created...so give them some extra change in their pocket to make it work.    2.  If Obama wants to rebuild infrastructure as well, that could stimulate the economy on a small scale -- but do it by cutting the pork out of H.R. 1 a.k.a H.R. HoG    Oh yah -- and pay for it by reducing bloated government programs.    People think this is going to be a quick rebound -- which is why they support the bill.  None of this money actually hits the market until the end of 2009.  It's going to be years before we experience solid growth -- so I say let the free market find its equilibrium rather than throwing good money after bad.      If anyone actually supports this bill -- they haven't read it and they're clinging to their party loyalty.  Foolish.  They chastise republicans for clinging to bush w/o question and then do the same when the shoe's on the other foot.  Read the bill and you'll be disappointed in many of the elected officials -- no shame.    By the way -- when did the "stimulus bill" turn into the bill that "provides America with a new direction"?      Nice marketing ploy.|`|JQwL50JMaa	We have already been in Depression mode for quite some time unfortunately.    This is the same type of thing FDR did in the 30s and it extended the Depression for a lot longer than it actually would have been.|`|IiPlkjNMaa	You're an idiot who knows nothing...how do you know we're going into a depression...because Obama tells you?    What's your background in econ?    How is increasing the size & scope of the government going to help the economy & how did the New Deal help the economy?    Tax cuts are the only good thing, as is government spending on infrastructure to create jobs...the rest is pork & obama & dems are paying back the people who helped get them into office, like all politicians do now with no regret...    edit:  sorry about idiot comment...I was angry the bill passed :)    I think that it was deflation that led to the great depression, which was a direct result of consumer spending/confidence.  I'm not sure how/why this actually fixes that, but I admit I haven't looked at the bill yet in great detail.  I just don't like how Obama/Bush created such urgency, when it's apparent the 1st injection of stimulus is doing nothing & these companies are already asking for more money.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	we have record low interest rates,low oil prices,we don't need to go into debt ,just give it time and things will improve|`|T8dMO04baa	This stimulus package is disgusting.

2CxfFENRaa	I feel a new movement happening.  Republicans(the people) are banning together and insisting on conservatism.  I have a feeling 2012 will be the new era of Reagan.  There are so many watchdog groups, Obama can't sneeze without us knowing.  I love how when the Dems tried to destroy Rush, we all stood behind him and didn't let them bully him like they do everybody else.  Until we have a great new leader like Reagan, Rush will be the voice of conservatism !!!!!!|`|C46DNX11aa	Andera, if you Republicans choose Rush as your new sports person. You will never win another election as long as you live.and now to answer the question.yes, they are right where they belong.

NktvqJhlaa	I'll just leave you with the answer I gave the kid in your link...    I'm not going to waste a bunch of words here so listen up..socialism and communism are just a sneakier form of slavery. Find someone who has escaped a communist country and they'll give you a real education on what it's all about. One thing you'll notice is that the only people in Love with communism are the people who have Never lived under it's tyranny.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Not yet. The U.S.S.R. is just taking a nap. All those old commies didn't just have some sort of epiphany and change their hearts. They are all still there. Putin is KGB to the core.The Soviet Union will rise again as we become weaker.We have been feeding "the Dragon" since Nixon made the mistake of opening up trade with them. The commies are just biding their time and waiting for us to weaken ourselves. We are doing a fine job of it too. Been to Wal Mart lately? Try to find products made in the U.S.A. Too many or our manufacturing jobs have gone overseas to the point that if for some reason we were to sever ties with Red China we couldn't even provide munitions and equipment for our own military. These damn globalists on BOTH sides are killing us!|`|cgb4WOnVaa	If you look beyond the basics which ended in 1989 with the fall of the Iron Curtain - it could be argued that we did "lose"..     Because just like every other war that we've won - we've gone in afterwards and used our economic might to help rebuild the country we defeated..   with the end result that the next generations of people in those countries resent us.  Will Iraq be the same?  Afghanistan?    Japan - Germany - Russia..  well, those are the largest examples.    On the other hand - we lost to Viet Nam, and it's taken nearly 40 years for them to marginally recover from their "victory".    It can be argued that - if you're in a third-world country and you need drastic help for your people - attack the US, lose militarily, and you'll win in the long run.    Edit - for Levon - BRILLIANT OBSERVATION!!|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	It's not over yet, it seems since the Liberals elected a monster named Obama. There are more stupid people throughout the world, Sir, than not, and they don't all live in America, you may be considered so yourself, by others with a temper tantrum...to judge a country as all is the height of stupidity, and shows a lack of self education...Good doesn't always win the battle, but the good die free, and unlike Socialists, refuse to be controlled. Folks who live with Socialism/Communism can never be more than controlled by hate, for no human can love who would make their people suffer so.    Whoops! God is Love!

(Sorry that so many answers missed the whole point of your question.  Don't give up.  Please try again.)|`|GJFBsG62aa	The Cold War wasn't really a war, it was all us "nuclear weapon holding" countries threatening eachother to press that red button.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	No, the USSR lost the Cold War.  After all, the goal of western administrations was to topple (or at least undermine) communism in Russia.  And Reagan did that through arms-racing the Soviets into the proverbial poor house.  In the end, their economy wasn't analogous to  overripe fruit, but rather a fruit tree rotten at the roots.    And China is more socialist (fragmented authoritarianist) than classical communist.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Russia and Venezuela are losing their standing as economic powers.  With falling oil world oil prices these two communist economic leader are a sad comparison to their status three years ago.  Russian citizens in 2008 through today, January 28, 2009 are hoarding dollars over rubles.   Ask someone on the streets of Moscow if the U.S. lost the Cold War.  They may not be a wild about the Russian "victory" as your esteemed Nikita.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Yes.|`|uAy7Y6HPaa	Yes, Obama's pick of CIA director is one piece of evidence we lost the Cold war.

What is the answer?  I suspect an intertwining of socialism (less a dictatorship) mixed with capitalism might be a solution.  We need to take care of each other or we will all go down with the ship.  We need new and innovative thoughts and idea's to keep the boat afloat.  We have to think outside the box.  I am hoping the new President will surround himself with people of independent and progressive idea's.  And remember that this problem is not restricted to the USA but is now a global problem.  I predict that things will improve after we pull the troops out of Iraq.  It has been a very expensive war.   And yes, we did win the cold war, because of the arms race with the Soviet Union....we bankrupted them while they were trying to keep up with the USA.  Now there isn't a Soviet Union just a Russia.  I just read that Moscow as a city has more billionaires than any other city in the world at this time.  So....no communism doesn't work, long term.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	No, if we did, what did we lose?  What is something that we had that we no longer had after the Cold War, something that we lost because of Russia?    The Cold War was a stalemate.    Communism will never die, ideologies tend not to.  While China may be a strong communist country, since the US has improved relations with them, they have migrated more towards a hybrid communist / capitalist country.|`|AXwJsjQ2aa	Sure our economy is weak right now, but the Russian economy is much, much weaker.|`|bxV80Clnaa	The Russians aren't fooling anyone. The only voice they have is gas and oil. Now with new sources of energy that voice is fading.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	No. Communism fell in Russia. And Russia did nothing to contribute to our current socialist-leaning president...our fellow countrymen did that to us.|`|AA11323988	You are so funny. If you listen to Gore I guess we won the cold war because according to him we are really heating things up. Not just in the USSR either, Gore says it is global.  I guess when the wall came down you could concider it a win. Russia does not have nukes in Cuba, is not controlling oil in the Middle East, and has not taken control of all land that Hitler held so I guess that too could be called a win for the US.    You say communism is still strong in China but in fact capitalism is taking hold there too. The people are beginning to relize that they can work to improve their own place in life rather than just improving the place of their ruler.|`|d1a2d96d28c063a31c38d6ccbb050904aa	Actually, the entire world's economy is weak.|`|zoPyYyXHaa	We seem to be back in the cold war.

6Fsliwlhaa	You could look into ROTC since they train you and do college at the same time.  You wouldn't deploy the whole time you are there and at the completion of ROTC you would become.an officer.  If you are already on a scholarship then it wouldn't be necessary.  You can do the ECS program with the Army Reserve so you are stabilized during college.|`|NDOvByeXaa	You could look into the reserves.. What ever you do would be pretty much impossible while actually taking a serious college schedule while going through basic...|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Even in the reserves you still take a chance of being deployed. Just join after you get out of college.
IxSCF4SZaa	You have several options on becoming an Officer in the Army. 1. you can join the Army Reserves and enroll in the SMP program and complete your degree. Once you complete your degree you can stay in the reserves or go active. While you are in the SMP program you will be able to drill with a local unit and make E5 pay. 2. you can join the Army reserves as an enlisted Soldier and do a direct commission without having a BA. To do a direct commission you will have to be a specialist with WLC which you can most likely get within a year or so, which might be quicker than finishing college before joining. I recommend this path (it is the one I did) since you will learn valuable skills and gain experience not gained by doing OCS. Once you get commissioned you will have 4 years to complete your BA degree. 3. if you want to go active, you will have to complete your degree and then enlist for OCS.|`|AA10709853	minimum 4 year degree.   associates will not cut it.  nor will multiple 2 year degrees.      and no that is not how it works.  you must apply for and be offered a commission.   not everyone who has a degree actually qualifies.   not every who qualifies is offered a commission.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	BA or BS, not two AAs.

It does not have to be a degree that the military can use.|`|3bmLXew7aa	You do not have to have any specific degree to become an Officer in the Army.  You have to complete your bachelor's degree before you can be promoted to Captain.  The Army has a thing called the "degree completion program" where they allow guys (mostly OCS attendees) the opportunity to finish their degree before their board for Captain.      Typically, if you have less than 60 credit hours, you cannot get into OCS, because the likelihood of you being able to complete your degree before Captain is low.

Not working out too well|`|AA11312653	I have never met anyone who didn't believe the old adage "The rich get richer and the poor get poorer." Another way of wording is "Money trickles UP, not DOWN."    The rich are very very good at hanging onto their money. Some of their money trickles down when they buy things or hire people, but they hang onto most of it and even manage to avoid paying taxes on a great deal.    The poor have a terrible time hanging onto their money. What with food and clothing and shelter and other such luxuries, they often spend even more than all they have. This puts their income back into our economy, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. The middle class often doesn't do much better, managing to save only a small proportion of their income.    There are many instances in our national history of times when the wealthiest Americans were doing very well and yet our nation as a whole faced want and deprivations. There has never been a period when America's middle class was strong and prosperous without increasing the prosperity of both the poor and the wealthy.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	The ranks of the poor will increase.

After this Obama situation is over, the Democratic party will break apart and lose power. A new party will form.  The Republicans will remain the longest lasting party in U.S history. There is a reason why Republicans are the longest lasting party in U.S history.  Maby the Democrats should take some pages out of the Republican books.

Highest unemploymnet rate since we started "trickle down"    Trickle down II:  We make more money, the workers make more money.    result: Widest disparity in economic means since the great depression.  The rich got richer and everybody else got poorer.    Bottom up theory:  Invest in technology- better equipment and training to use it.  pay the employees 90% of the improved productivity and take 10% of that productivity as a return on capital+ management salaries.  As productivity improves, the workers make more and that paltry 10% gets larger in real dollars.    Result: that's what we had until we changed to trickle down.

Edit: wake up people!! It is becoming increasingly evident to all but the UNTHINKING or the wealthy that "trickle down" failed to keep middle class wages high enough to support a real economy.Credit was used as a substitute to keep the economy afloat,and this was done by every administration since Reagan including Clinton.

What happens if you point the spray down?|`|zrggGS2Caa	Trickle-down might work if the money actually did trickle down. The gap between the rich and the poor has only widened under that theory. Instead, it seems the money at the top is used to buy other companies, consolidate their operations, shut down factories and send jobs overseas. Big companies care only about the return they can offer their investors, not the people that work for them. The money just revolves around at the top.This is the new America, get used to it.

U36GI9FUaa	Many black people couldn't even be doctors and now we have our first black president. that is pretty special.|`|mSVlAsGhaa	He is black....it ends there.  I think Dr. King was hoping for something better.|`|YcgEmrRkaa	Do you see that he is the most powerful person in the world?|`|OtUozt5raa	It has partially because they let Obama be president.|`|f36a70ysaa	it did not, it was the opposite of what Rev.

They are nothing a like besides that fact that they are of african american decent.|`|WpqfQOTJaa	Dr. King wanted all races to be equal.    And personally, I take that litterally. I say it means that voting for a president just because he's black is racist. It SHOULDN'T matter at all what colour his skin is. And that, is what Dr. King was hoping for.    Not affirmative action.    Mr. King wanted all races to be treated equal, so I imagine he wouldn't like the way obama refers to his own grandmother as a typical whitey. Obama is a black supremast. Mr. King was all for EQUALITY. There's a difference u know.    Now, if Dr. King was still with us and ran for president and won, I'd be very happy.  Not obama.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	It hasn't, MLK and MLK jr. were all about a new world where America lived up to the ethic of "all men" being treated equal since America admitted a long time ago in their founding that they are created equal.  Since Obama has had a significant favor with groups of people including minority sectors all based on race, it isn't truely a real victory.  What's funny is all the people whining about racism against blacks. That hasn't been a problem for some time really. Where do you see the burning crosses on lawns ? People getting hung ? sure, there's pockets here and there of racism, you can't change everyone, but the lion's share of racism is against white people.  examples..........The black panthers in Philadelphia claiming "there's going to be a black president no matter what"...what of the words of Rev. Wright seemingly under some misconception that America hasn't changed for 40+ years...like there's been absolutely no improvement...meanwhile the guy got a million dollar house in a while neighborhood after making disparaging remarks of how rich white men rule the country,.  Then of course you have the well known comments of Michelle Obama saying that her husband becoming president was the event that prompted her to say she was finally proud of her country. I guess the 1st black supreme court member wasn't a point to be proud of, I guess all the progress America has made and the fact that America was the first in the international community to protest slavery.  Seems to me there's a long history of racism against white people which hasn't been addressed and hasn't changed.|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	In no way whatsoever!

My son is 30 & he has friends of all races & they don't notice a difference in a negative way. My son has Muslim friends that are so nice yet most people my age don't know anything about Muslims except the fear the Bush adminstration put out. So the dream of children walking hand in hand is already happening in many areas, if not most....Obama winning has helped many black people to not thing all white people hate them. I was some where the other day & noticed that 2 black men started talking to me & my husband & I really think they would have not been so friendly to us before the Obama factor. I have always been friendly towards black people but have not always got as warm  a reception. It is different. I am very intutive & have heard others talk about this. My church has never been a place where people spoke about politics. We are all different religions & even non-believers who are spiritual people. We were all rejoicing in this man who is so filled with integrity & allows divine intelligence to flow through him. So through the people who have open hearts his open heart will flow.

The Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting each other for hundreds of years BEFORE the United States was even founded.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Well, if your really tired of it, then maybe you would like to get more informed of the internal workings first before making any recriminations.  First, America gives out like $14 billion in foreign aid. I can't think of any real reason we are giving other countries money when they hate us as a country.  Second, the foreign aid that we give Israel has resulted in an ally that votes along the lines of the USA 94% of the time, and since they are the only reliable ally in the middle east, we don't have alot of options.  The weapons going to israel is israel's way of giving the foreign aid money back to us... its been shown by some politicians that they don't want our money.   So your problem should be with our politicians...not israel.  Third, if you actually lived in Israel i doubt you'd be so voisterous.  Israel is surrounded by enemies. Most of the islamic world around them have vowed to never allow peace until israel is dead, buried or pushed into the ocean. This has not changed, this has been openly stated since before the 80's...but back then to now is when things heated up.  Israel has been randomly bomed, hit with rockets and usually whined against from the international community and liberal cry babies for doing nothing more than protecting themselves.  Have they been a little overhanded once in a while, perhaps, but with good reason to try and make it "sting" a little so these muslim idiots stop terrorizing Israel.  Look at what happened in the Gaza Strip when Israel pulled their people out and gave it away.......The 2 main factions warred with themselves for control.  If you can't understand that the islamic world is not going to change their opinions, aren't going to change their vendictive and terroist ways, then you have no voice in this debate, because you have no clue how the enemy thinks and what their culture is like. We have enough elitists sitting in their ivory towers thinking they know the answer and what to do when they've never even talked to anyone with the intel or in the very streets they are talking about.|`|5rQnJZ8uaa	FIRST you should look to your own history  british imperialism has alot to do with the conflict that is still going on in Israel and Palestine google- white papers- The jewish people have been exploited for hundreds of years before christ was born finally in1949 they said enough  and have not looked back.  The U.S, should and will continue to support Israelis|`|KOF2lcydaa	Good plan. Cut off the Israelis supplies and allow the Arabs to overwhelm them and murder them all.

We have no intention of letting the Arabs tell us which of our Allies are acceptable, and which must go.|`|IbyxsgHhaa	There is nothing wrong with supporting one nation over the other, and I think the support of Israel by the U.S. is valid and fine, BUT it should not be UNCONDITIONAL support, especially when Israel is holding back civil rights of Palestinian citizens, closing borders for food/medicine/water delivery, building walls, thats taking it too far. That is wrong. The U.S. under Obama should spend time understanding problems of both nations, and SHOULD BE CRITICAL of UNJUST ACTIONS by EITHER side, moreso of those by Israel.
FEVQisMGaa	USAF.    First of all what's your degree?    EDIT:    Okay. The military will give you better benefits straight off the bat.  If you have a bachelor's degree that'll automatically make you eligible to become an officer--that's a good thing.    But it will demand more from you.    You need to assess why you're doing this in the first place.  Military is most certainly not "the way to go" if you have a promising college degree.    If you choose AF:    The AF has a community college, so you could probably even finish your schooling there.    The only problem is the travel issue. Do you want to travel?    With the CG, you'll be (obviously) where there is coastline in America.    If it's AF, it's all up for grabs.    CG is like the National Guard. The benefits are negligible.    If your intention is law enforcement, you should go w/ the FBI.    But the FBI will be more accepting of you have a military background, instead of a CG background.|`|6T21TZIQaa	HI...MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO BE FBI. she had a interview with them and they suggested she go usaf. and she did. she now works for the us marshals. but the dea and marshals and fed postal inspectors plus our local police dept all wanted her when she got out of the air force. it was the best thing she could have done. would tell anyone to do this , it's a great way to get a education too. she had her assoc in criminal justice already, then got her bachelors in IT and criminal justice. good luck....ps usaf treats their people really good.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	Af for a career as a state or local cop, USCG for federal law enforcement career.|`|LN81w60haa	Well, from what I've heard, a lot of the jobs that the Coast Guard does are enforcement jobs (hence the name Guard). I mean, they do everything from escorting US Navy vessels, to busting up drug runners at sea. That's about as much enforcement as you could get outside of police work. Although, there is absolutely nothing wrong with joining the Air Force. You could always be an MP or something.
5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	It will harm the average American greatly, especially the poor, lower and middle classes, and those on fixed incomes because it is going to lead to out of control INFLATION.    Even if Obama gives you a little check, everything will cost so much, it won't matter    The Congressional Budget Office has testified before Congress that the money won't even begin to get to the economy for at least 18 to 24 months.  No jobs either for at least that time.  There were signs before Bush left that he had begun to turn things around but that has now come to a halt because of investor pessimism over what Congress and the Obama Administration are planning to do.   That's why you are seeing the weak and falling stock market and the new terrible job losses.  Business is laying off workers in anticipation of increased taxes and government mandates.    Recessions end by themselves unless the government intervenes with poor policy decisions - like this so-called "stimulus" package.  When the effects of it are felt in about 2 years as the CBO predicts, pent-up demand by consumers will begin to push prices way up.  Increased taxes on businesses will be passed on in higher prices on goods and services.  This happened during the Carter Adminsitration.  The inflation rate then was 13.5% - that's 3.5 TIMES what it is today.  This is NOT the worst economy since the Depression. It's the worst since Carter and it isn't that bad yet.  Obama will make it that bad.     It will NOT help one bit that Obama signed an Executive Order ending new domestic and offshore drilling.  Look for another surge in energy prices.  That affects ALL prices and adds to inflation.  He has also mandated new CAFE standards which Detroit can not meet and still make affordable cars which people will buy.  Nice payoff to the environmental special interests.

AA12109395	Best possible option is to attempt to talk to your lender and work out a settlement before your court date. The judge doesn't want to hear excuses, He/she will want to hear how you intend to fulfill your responsibility. If the judge sees that you are making an honest effort to fulfill your debt, they may allow for mediation where you voluntarily tell the lender when and how you will pay your debt. If not, they will enter a judgment against you where a schedule will be set outlining the total, installments, no of payments, dates for payment, etc.and specify what happens if you fail to comply. That judgment stays on your credit record for 7 - 10 years. Failure to comply with the order could then result in forcible garnishment of your wages, FUTURE TAX RETURNS, a lien on your personal property or other measures decided by the judge. You really want to get out in front of this! Once the judgment is on your credit record, its there for a decade.  Trust me, these judges have heard every excuse in the book, so do yourself a favor and prepare a plan to repay the debt before a judgment is entered against you!|`|AA11828439	The amount increases. If you NEVER pay, yes you can be jailed.|`|0e539871ad8eb4b77f7ddc8a1e19fd53aa	It will be a civil matter and the lender will probably take you to court and you will probably have a judgement against you.

Then pay some along. Don't try to get out of something you owe.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I feel sorry for the sucker that trusted you enough to loan you $1100. I feel sorry for this person because you betrayed his trust and took advantage of his friendship and generosity.  So, you took this guys money, promising to pay it back with your tax refund.  What happened to your tax refund?  What made you think you were getting this refund? Or was that just a lie.  How did you know you'd get this refund by 2/5?    You want the lender to cancel ??? the note?  Why would he throw away $1100?  I'm sure he could have paid a lot of his own bills and/or went on a little vacation with that money.  I hope that he wins in court, everything plus the money he has to put out to pursue a small claims case - filing fees, process serving fees, etc.  I hope he gets to garnish your wages/lien on any property, etc. If I were you I'd find a way to make money, get a 2nd job, and put it in a savings account for when this does go to court.  You might be able to show the judge you have some money towards this debt.  I've been burnt by friends not repaying loans.  The last time, I made sure I not only had a promissory note - but collateral worth more than the loan.  This friend skipped town.  Months later, they are asking for their collateral back.  Heee Heeee Haaaa Haaa Heeee Heee Haaa.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	worse case senario they can garnish wages or even your tax return|`|AA11694451	The US doesn't have debtor's prison (thank God otherwise 80% of Americans would be in jail). This would more than likely result in a wage or asset garnishment to fulfill the obligation. It will "ding" your credit, but I have a feeling it is already tarnished. Best case scenario the creditor drops the issue and you hear nothing more. Worst case scenario you have to pay the full amount by wage and/or asset garnishment. Anything in between is tolerable.

T8nap2Pnaa	well, to start with, did he enter legally or illegally?  the fact that he shows up on one of the birth certificates as an American could certainly cause problems, especially if they think he was posing as an American using false documents.  As for Palestine or Jordan, that would depend on when he was born or his current citizenship. The West Bank was Jordan until 67. is he a Jordanian citizen or a Palestinian citizen. or a Palestinian carrying a Jordanian passport, another possibility.    If he came legally to begin with, there will likely be lots of questions, but if you have good answers, you should be ok. if he came illegally, your answers won't matter so much as he'll have to leave to apply in Jerusalem or Amman, depending.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	PLEASE STOP ASKING THIS SAME QUESTION.    you lied on the application (signed it as being true to the best of your knowledge)  you sent in false information (birth certificates with wrong birthdates)   so you must pay the price.

Why are people in this country stupid enough to allow their children to be brainwashed at school when they aren't old enough or mature enough to understand what is really going on in this world?    Well, I think you assume I actually read that long-winded article, and I did not.  I don't like prison planet, mostly because of the creepy design and some of the really out there stuff they put on it from time to time.    I skimmed the article to get an idea of what it is talking about, and I don't have any doubt that what they say is true.  Schools all over the place are indoctrinating children...and as Americans, we need to stand up and fight this.  I pulled my children from a school in my area during the election when their teacher wanted them to write poems about Obama and put on a play in his honor.  I told them:  YOU WILL NOT indoctrinate my children.  I put them in a private school, which is sort of hard on the old wallet for my husband and I, but it's well worth it if they're minds aren't being poisoned.|`|wQ5LKysaaa	Anyone who isn't disturbed by this blind worship by the masses, or Obama's acceptance of it, is nuts!

Don't you folks want to see what he will accomplish before you plaster his iconic image on  walls?  You are selling America out!    No doubt Obama is cunning, and very well-spoken.  Now think of other leaders in history who had the same qualities that lead the masses to blindly follow.  Scary stuff!

AA12191521	our justice system has some major problems. And in most places, an accusation of a crime is all it takes to convict. We say "innoccent until proven guilty" but we don't mean it. The legal system exists to get convictions. Finding the truth and applying justice are not priorities. Public defenders are assigned to indigent people. But the court decides who is indigent and who is not. Generally anyone with a job makes too much to qualify for a public defender. Anyone who can make bail cannot have a public defender either. So most poor people are still too wealthy to get one and not rich enough to hire a lawyer. So they go to court on their own and face a legal system that is stacked against them. Everyone is just trying to bully them into pleading guilty because they don't have the means to fight the charges. The accused are not even allowed to see evidence before trial. How can you prepare a defense without knowing what the evidence is against you. Judges and juries generally take anything the prosecutor and the police say as absolute fact. Even when they are lying. If you can't afford a very good lawyer, you will be found guilty regardless of the facts of the case. If we truly believe that all people are innoccent until proven guilty then we should devote as much money to defending the accused as we do to prosecuting them. The public defenders should be just as well paid and have just as much resources and access as the DA's office. Appeals courts need to have actual authority to review judgements of lower courts. As it is now an appeal is only granted if procewdure was violated. It doesn't matter if the decision of the lower court was right or wrong just whether they filled out the paperwork correctly. When we have a fair and equitable justice system, we can have faith that sentences are truly just and only applied to the guilty. We can know that when a murderer is executed, it the right person. It needs a lot of work to make it right. But it was at least founded on good principals. We just have a long way to go to live up to them.|`|95gEZ22Caa	You need more beef in your brain eat a double whooper and then you tell us how stronger crime is getting ,lets all eat on it...DINO|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Weaknesses - corrupt politicians|`|AXNkmdbKaa	You think the public helps with the capturing of criminals?

qNVP4Q1Saa	We need to know where this happened, the name of the carrier and if the shipment was insured. The consumer is the person who paid for the shipment and they are the complaint origin. If you paid then you are the consumer. If you did not pay then you are teh recipient and if you did not need to sign anything you must go to your brother. if you signed for them, that was your approval.|`|AA11622716	There is little that you can do because you had no contract with the shipper.  Your brother might have a comlaint, but most shippers do not guarantee delivery without damage unless one pays extra for that guarantee.  Furthermore, your brother's complaint is a private matter, not something that the taxpayers will pay for.  It he wants to sue the shipper for breach of contract, he will have to hire a lawyer at his own expense.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Look to see if your city has a Department of Consumer Affairs or something with a similar name; it's usually part of the District Attorney's office.|`|EvlPzrVOaa	when you signed for it did you include the damages. if not then the chances of getting somewhere would be hard. since basically when someone receives something in bad condition the invoice would be noted. thats why stores an such inspect everything first then sign and let the driver go.
auUeI2Vnaa	Because not everyone will ever agree on the issue.    Just like half the people answer this question with their view on the matter I think sound ridiculous...if they knew my stance, they'd probably think I was ridiculous also.    I think women should CHOOSE to be better protected to begin with...instead of CHOOSE to go about doing their business as if there will never be any repercussions (oh wait, they get to choose if there are any repercussions! should we give this courtesy to criminals?).|`|0ixBWT6Xaa	Too many different opinions, which could all be right or all be wrong.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Because one side sees the action as murder, and the other side sees the removal of choice as forced slavery.|`|AA10206116	Because legalize it, and people won't get it through their thick heads that they are terminating a life.

In medieval times, this was considered women's business and women resolved their own fertility issues, often with the help of wise women/ herbalists.   Men do not understand  - no uterus, no say.  Same as the Church (run by men) who feel they have real imput -they don't. Only a woman should be in charge of her  own reproduction, she knows what her body can and can't do/accept and there shouldn't be all this drama around the issue which of course is laden with shame and guilt.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	well because 40% see it as Murder to the Unborn Child That it is cruel and even if they can't keep it send it off for adoption.  The the other40% see's it as An o.k subject because if you can't tend for the baby then why have it to send it off for adoption then it will have to spend the rest of it's life wonder WHY?  Then 20% like myself are undicided because we see it in both ways Rich people who can take cae of the baby Abort It theneven the moe selfish ones who didnt use a condom abort it, but on the other hand What if your Raped What if your Father Rapes You what if your poor and even if it is sent off to Agencies it can go through numerouse homes and may even DIE    Me Myself could never in my heart find it to Abort a Baby for my own Selfish Ordeals, yet im Undicided So it will be another one of those subjects brung up at reuins and dinners and crap that will never be settled and will go on and on and on!!!!!!!   hope this helps|`|iLTlJszaaa	Kanye West: "How could you be so heartless?"|`|r7gxrbqGaa	Because there will always be people who want to argue for the hell of it.|`|8Yz1gFGVaa	Because it's an issue based on religion/religious views and every religion believes they are the right one.|`|AA11394813	Because there will always be people who think there are reasons where murder is justified.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	there will always be irresponsible women out there who cant grasp the concept of how babies are actually made?|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Because some people don't realise they should never EVER bring a baby into the world and think it's their God-given right to f**k up a life before they've even created it.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	Because everyone is so sure of thier answer they wont agree with anyone elses its like war or taking people off life machines everyones different so everyone has their own answer :) hope that helps|`|nLXfeQbpaa	Because some people are just ignorant.   Its no one's choice except the mother.   And the dumb *** men that say "oh just give it up for adoption"...Do you honestly think after 9 months of carrying a body, you're going to just GIVE it away. By that time your "mother Hormones" are raging. You want that baby.   Not to mention the Post traumatic stress syndrome you have for the next 6 months.|`|bBXCwP5waa	i don't know i guess some people just is against it and some people are really not ready for a baby, but i think they should put them p for adoption instead of killing them|`|HhPgZDDzaa	Some women feel it is their right to do what they want with their body and don't like being told that they have to go through a pregnancy they don't want.

Its 50/50 whichever way you look at it, and since America is the land of "freedom" they want to be "free to do what they want with their own body" while other people "want the baby to be free the way it was intended"|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	because people don't understand that if it's not alive, why do you have to kill it to get rid of it?|`|XmBQZCeSaa	Abortion should be illegal. Any girl willing to get an abortion is a heartless *****. If you aren't financially ready for a baby then either DONT HAVE SEX or if you do and get pregnant, Then put it up for adoption.

Of you are responsible enough to have sex then you are responsible enough to have a baby.|`|4d4afefa5b9c627a8ae768b94250b882aa	Abortion is controversial, it is not an issue to be solved.|`|6fe3c0231b9ccc30387b1ee54ad6df98aa	The reason that abortion as an issue can not be solved is because there are too many people who think it is there place to judge weather a person should get an abortion or not. People who are involved in church have the belief that every life is sacred no matter what the circumstances of the pregnancy are. While others think that abortion is wrong if it is an accidental pregnancy. The last people are the ones who believe that an abortion is a personal issue that nobody else but the person pregnant should decide on. These are the reasons that we can never solve this issue it is because of religion. In our government there is religion where there should not be. This makes it so that even if it is not the governments place to decide what people do with their lives they will make it there place. I personally believe that it is the woman who is pregnant place.|`|zoPyYyXHaa	The bottom line is that people are selfish. If something like a baby comes along and they did not want one then they think themselves and go get an abortion. Which I believe is sinful.

For example, people disagree on when the fetus is able to feel pain, when the zygote becomes a "baby", etc. Then there are legal issues- like do you make exceptions for women who become pregnant by rape. It's impossible to please everyone.|`|Sow1mTFuaa	Because there is something called opinion. And this subject is so controversial no 2 sides will ever agree|`|f54f60a84eedc6e31006d4096b5ba532aa	Primarily because everyone has a different opinion on it.     Lots of people think that no matter what stage a pregnancy is at, it is considered a living being and therefore abortion is a form of murder.    On the other hand just as many people think that a woman's body is her personal business. No one can lay claim to her womb and it's her choice to do with her uterus as she chooses.    There's also a general belief that a baby that would not be able to survive outside of it's mother is not a living being and therefore it isn't murder to abort.     There's all of these viewpoints floating around and unfortunately no one can find a comfortable gray area, because one side says "NO NEVER" and the other side says "It's a personal matter, to be determined by each individual." Due to these extremes it's hard for a consensus to be reached.|`|9QK0yT89aa	Because people have different morales.

As we can see, we are working our way down the wrong road...|`|x12mMdApaa	better at what? being a retard, scrabble what?|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Thats PRESIDENT Obama to you mister.    Oh, yeah, he is much better.|`|RTxFNURzaa	lol stupid question its your opinion half the people will say obama and half McCain. But really would you of wanted an old man who can't use a computer and the dumbest vice president ever or a man who wants change and is young and knows what america need and we need|`|I6dcRgD6aa	It doesn't matter what the people here say the country has voted. 80% of the country is supporting Obama so that should give you your answer.|`|ZhbYrBf7aa	McCain is better at playing dumb and selling out. McCain used to be bipartisan, but he gave that up initially in 2000 when Bush took away McCain's nomination with perverse political maneuvering. He totally went the other way when Kerry offered to share the 2004 ticket with him, and he followed the company line rank and file for the next several years until he got it absolutely Right.     Obama is better at reaching across the aisle, and dissolving/diffusing conflicts before they even got started. He's practical and pragmatic. I think he's playing his games like every other poloitician and will ask for ridiculous things in order to compromise in the middle, which is where he wants to end up anyway. His decision making algorhythm is exceptional, and he speaks with poise, clarity, confidence and honesty. He has something to prove.    Obama was the President of Harvard Law Review and McCain barely squeaked through Annapolis even though his father and grandfather were legacies.    So, I guess it really depends on what you mean by "better"?|`|AA12142423	obviously obama, I mean, he is our president now. for a reason. so get over this. it's done.|`|JwDWwgIcaa	OBAMA!    Rock on my American friends, rock on    :D    Canadian|`|WoESqX8gaa	Better at what? Define your meaning.|`|AA11516222	Better at what?  McCain is much better at looking like a crazy, old, senile coot.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	Mccain punched his own ticket when he picked his VP and why is he not jumping up to help save the economy heck he put his campaign on hold too do it last time|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Obama is better why because at least he is trying to make things better but don't believe things are easy, McCain If he was President we would be not only in recession but in a Depression I mean Americans would more jobs and Wall Street would collapse to record lows Bailouts Everyone will ask for them and Nobody would get them People would be throwing out of their Homes and out on the streets and People will lose Jobs left and right I mean You would look at long lines at Unemployment Centers and Food Shelters and all places like will turn people away.    I say I'm Happy that I voted for Obama.|`|ooCvJWPHaa	President Obama.|`|m5CiESVdaa	Look, it's over, you won, get over it.|`|F43ynVGdaa	mccain, duh|`|OAA2DuYnaa	Neither !!!|`|qhvQDcdfaa	obama won, who cares.|`|LXK8ktGOaa	lol they r both good but obviously more pople like obama|`|p9qiQFIGaa	McCain is spelled M c C a i n|`|Xx0Xsgwzaa	Canadians conspired to elect Obama to get favorable trade relations:        www.CanadaforObama.com|`|WpqfQOTJaa	Personally, I like McCain. Palin is AWESOME also. I know my opinion is worthless according to obamans, but here's my opinion. Remember,   [directed at the obamans]  condemning my opinion just because you don't agree with it, is very nazi-ish.      But I find that obamans seem to believe that obama is basically Jesus Christ. I think those people need to get off his c0ck and actually take a look at his views, instead of his skin colour.    Most people voted for obama only because his skin colour, and i think that's wrong.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Doesn't matter now Obama is the President and Mcain is old and on his way out!|`|IpIx4Naiaa	Mccain, i have nothing wrong with obama but i do not think he is going to be a good president  cause the matter of the fact is, the president holds many secrets about the war and Obama is going to learn it is going to be very hard to get out of the war    so he made promises he won't be able to keep.|`|FpCFxilvaa	McCain would have been a better president...Just wait and see Obama ruin this country|`|3OeE8kMQaa	It has been decided through a democratic election, Obama is the choice determined through both the popular vote and electoral college. Like it or not he's our president. If you don't like it, work harder next time around to have your voice heard through the democratic process that made this nation great. Until then, don't be one of those jerks who is "praying" for this administration's failure (ie: Rush Limbaugh et. al) I never prayed for President Bush's failure, I just got sick of his consistency in doing so.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	Obama|`|S4IvjacEaa	Most morons that support Obama, don't have the facts (and think George Bush is to blame for everything)...they just want to be part of the "oh yeah! black young dude vs old smelly man" scene or don't really even care (just look at all the answers you've already gotten encouraging Obama, with nothing to back him up)   He has close to no experience at all, he's been a senator for a very short amount of time and spent most of it campaigning and accomplished NOTHING in office, take a look at his ridicules health care plan, opinion on abortion, he will increase taxes...not just the wealthy even the lazy asses who think he's the messiaha, just to give you the idea, because "Dudes I know that Obama is totally AWSOME" doesn't make you seem very intelligent or that you'd even understand. The correct choice was obviouse, and it WASN'T Obama.|`|lv9ahVwgaa	McCain|`|OCFh5CBlaa	McCain had a lot of good qualities:  very honest  very modest    but    Did you know that while he was a POW he almost committed suicide but the guards stopped him. Imagine if we would have elected for president someone who tried to commit suicide. Not good. The only thing he has better then Obama is that he has more experience. That doesn't always hide the question has to whether he will be a good president though. Obama has been doing some good things for this economy already like shut down Gitmo Bay. It costs us taxpayers 780 million dollars to keep open. Not a wise investment on Bush's part.|`|uKkvlauQaa	I actually like Obama better. I think he would be a better president|`|5QtNX1NRaa	i agree with you Ali!!|`|CD0i5cW5aa	Obama. Mcain wasn't bad, but at 72 and 4 heart attacks, his vp Palin, was as dumb as a brick.
Y8kjVeLyaa	Before you spend any money I think you should contact the Citizens Advice Beureau in the U.K....they are free and of course give very good legal advice..I think you may have to split and sell the house by mutual agreement....I think Italian law will probably take precedence...it will get better..I am in a similar situation myself.
AaXl3vcCaa	if it is a court appointed lawyer then they are with the public defenders office, and you could call and talk to them , i doubt they will talk to you about anything without your sons permission though, privacy stuff|`|5gG2OfHIaa	The court appointed lawyer should still be in town.  His written motions before the trial would have his address.  It is difficult to imagine how the lawyer just disappeared.   I am not aware of any criminal procedure for a non-lawyer to represent a party in a criminal case.  I am sure you cannot represent your son for a hearing for a sentence reduction or appellate filings.  Bottom line:  either a licensed attorney in the state of the conviction or the accused, himself, must file written motions asking for the relief he seeks. Courts rarely set aside a jury verdict.|`|z88IMXNFaa	You cannot represent your son.  He can represent himself or a lawyer can represent him.  He was not granted an appeal.  All cases, criminal or civil have the right to an appeal.  The length of the sentence can be part of the appeal.    Your son's lawyer is under no obligation to speak to you and, most issues will be covered by attorney-client privilege and cannot be discussed with you.
sr7jX2wYaa	Yes  you have the evidence you need to win the case. If I  were  you I would call one of those T.V. shows, & not only when you win will you get your  money, you will be famous , for a day & I believe they pay you something  for  your appearance*|`|eulMjLtPaa	It sounds as if you have a good case and a reasonable amount of evidence.  Small Claims Court would be your option (check your state for its particular SCC limits).      I'm not sure where you got the $300 amount.  When I last used SCC, the fees were filing fee of about $20, process server at $50 (rather than the sheriff at $30).  Of course, there will be other fees involved in collection if he refuses to pay after the judgment.|`|d997b5ac6eed086c92a56500bdb74431aa	Yes, you have a case.  Take it to Small Claims Court, and bring copies of all your correspondence.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	This is why lending someone money is a huge mistake. Just find as much proof as possible, and the chances of you winning will increase. I'm pretty sure that you would win...although I am obviously not 100% sure. But I do hope that you learned from this mistake, and you never lend ANYONE money again!    Good luck|`|0XPmUZpZaa	I would say you're screwed buddy, but hopefully it could work out for you. I don't think messages over MySpace would be good enough evidence, he could say somebody else was on his account during the time, and there is no real way to prove it was him. Maybe next time you lend money, you should have written proof on a legal document. Good luck!
botH6rIQaa	law enforcement,  they'll hire you,  you're at the top of their list.  You can  move up quickly if you are dedicated.  Plus most offer a pension after 10 years,  so if it wasn't for you ,  you could quit and try something else and still have that pension later on. Still being young you could find another job with a pension and collect from both when you retire.|`|AA10025824	Try a local or state job service.  Especially a new veteran because there are companies that put you at the front of the line when you apply.|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	You cannot rely on your 'infantry' training to land you mid-management level position.  What is it you want to do?  This is a great time for you to lie low & go to college. The GI pays over $1000 a month tax free. Spend the next 4 years in college & see what the world has to offer then    That's what I did.|`|Kw6EyIFdaa	im not sure, my cousin is having that same problem|`|raImBqwraa	I hear that - I was out of the grunts for almost 4 months before I got the job I have now, and it's terrible to be out of work and money. Here's what I can suggest though...    1. FILE YOUR VA CLAIMS. I work in a lawyers office now helping veterans get their disability money, and I can tell you, it's no joke. I spend all day helping airmen get disability for their broken pinkies and bruised egos, I love nothing more than to help out a fellow Marine grunt who probably has some real problems. I'm going to shoot you an e-mail quick and explain more, but in short, it's money you've earned. I get almost $1300 a month in disability compensation for some leftovers I have from the Corps.    2. Go to college. The GI Bill is also money in a big way, especially if you can get into a community college that doesn't charge as much and bank the rest of it.    3. Talk to the VA - they can hook you up with local job placement and temp agencies and might know of vet-friendly companies in your area that are hiring.    EDIT - Apparently you don't allow e-mail, shoot me one here if you want.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Try something with the government. You will be given extra consideration from being a veteran.     Law Enforcement is still a growing career field and your experience in the Marines will help you have an edge on the competition. If you prefer something else, check all the local, county, state and federal websites for open jobs.    I am rather biased towards law enforcement since it is a stable employer that can offer great pay and excellent benefits, but it is dependent on who you work for.     The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is still hiring. I believe the starting pay is around $47,000 a year for either a police or corrections recruit. Check www.protectthecity.com for additional details. Most of the law enforcement jobs in Las Vegas start around that and you get medical/dental, paid retirement, holiday pay, and extremely generous uniform allowances (around $1500 a year).    Federal law enforcement is a good choice as well and alot of jobs are only open to veterans.    Hope this helps.|`|mPS2Zccaaa	Have you tried going through a staffing agency? What type of position are you looking for? If you are trying to apply for an office position you may need a degree in the field. My husband is an infantry veteran and has also found it difficult to find a position now that he is out of the military. He wants a career path in law enforcement. Although many agencies offer Veterans points to add to your final scores of law enforcement postitions, there are still hundreds of other applicants. I am extremely proud of my husband and I know potential employers are as well but being a veteran is not going to put you automatically in the front during the recruitment process. I asked a my previous supervisor regarding this same subject and he said he would love to hire a veteran because he is thankful for all they do (he was a vet) but if another person came up for the position and had education or experience in the field, he would hire the candidate with education rather than the one he would personally choose. Don't get down about it, you are a veteran and I am extremely proud of you. It isn't easy and there isn't as much help in finding a position outside of service the way the military makes it seem. But don't give up and don't forget about the G.I. Bill, use it to the max!    Good luck with your job search and again, I'm proud of you.
CVtwbIKLaa	No silly - that was the "selfish" republicans only helping themselves. BO is going to save the world, well except America - let's see we can neuter our military, give money to welfare cheats (not all but a serious majority), take care of our illegal pals (this time I mean the bankers not the immigrants) Most of us won't see one red cent because that 250 per year he started at is well under 100 thou already and most people who make under 50,000 don't pay taxes already - they get the refunds.    Where is the brain trust on this - oh yes the messiah will reward us greatly...|`|4TqERLSgaa	No. We will get a tax break. That means when you file your taxes next year and you get back two thousand dollars, you will get three thousand. If you have to pay, your screwed. The only people getting checks, are welfare recipients, and people who don't earn enough to file taxes, or pay them|`|7y6yfrQlaa	tax cuts in your paycheck so in a sense yes; new jobs for those who need it|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Yes.|`|Xx0Xsgwzaa	No, the money goes to local government districts so Congress can get reelected, the american people don't matter.|`|FpCFxilvaa	It only makes you think you will get a check...Actually it goes onto your final amount for the year and when you fill your taxes it gets taxed with the rest so what you get from it the majority will just be going back into the government..So its a screw over.But to be honest Im not a hundred percent sure though I highly doubt that we will be getting what we got last year..Obama will find a way to screw over America some how

ohxiNOFjaa	Only about 50% of everyone in Miami.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	I doubt it.  Castro gave the working class of Cuba free schools, free midicare.    What this does is to keep the masses happy.  They have no plans to change anything in Cuba, in spite of what Republican Americans might think.    When Castro dies, nothing will change  in Cuba except the party leadership.|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Yes,quite alot actually in N.J.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	There aren't many working-class Cubans, mostly just starving class.|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	I'd say that 99.99% of the working class Cuban Americans are against Castro.  As for Cubans in Cuba, it's hard to say.  You know they can't really voice their opinion.|`|Ph4YvA5Paa	A good question.  I am sure there are.We do need to remember that Castro allowed anybody, who prefered the Capitalism system, to leave for the US.So, I would say that most Cubans are supporters of Castro.I think if the US would stop supporting terrorism and  insurgencies inside Cuba ,then Cuba would have less censorship.  After 50yrs of the US trying to bankrupt Cuba, I think their will to survive under seige/blockades, with little luxury and pleasures -yet manage to create the second best(cheapest) healthcare system in the world,free education for all,is the ultimate act of Patriotism
8Mi15cTtaa	yes - they can sue you and, depending on the situation, they'd win.    Even if it weren't illegal, it's WRONG!|`|y0jL9n6Taa	yes.  We call that theft of services.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	yes...you or they better have a good reason.|`|p9qiQFIGaa	Go ahead and try it You'll be sorry|`|VjgqZetcaa	Yes, it is fraud: misrepresentation that you would pay for something when you intended to stop payment after receiving the services.  The fact that you cancel payment (for any reason) is evidence of intent to defraud and it would be up to you to provide evidence that there was a different, lawful reason for the cancellation.
a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	It would depend upon a few things.  You would definitely have to get permission from your PO.  It would also depend on the reason for which you are on probation.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Get permission from officer in writing.  Let him know in mexico will you be staying,who you are going with,  what dates going and returning and the purpose of your trip.  If you are going down for spring break or something like that --------------------forget about it.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	It is virtually un heard of to be allowed to leave the country while on probation.  Depends on the crime, how long you have been on probation,a dn why you want to go.
AA10123414	Your property was on the property of another. As such, Penal Code Sec. 484 does not apply.    Also, you have not indicated any attempt to resolve this issue other than your call to the sheriff that properly indicated it was a civil matter. Unless you have attempted to resolve the issue no judge will listen to the case.    Once you attempt to resolve the issue, if it remains unresolved you can sue the owner of the trailer.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	why did you wait until the last minute?|`|DPegPYRPaa	It can be both. It could be a misdemeanor And they may have to pay a victim restitution fine. Get on the sherriffs butt!|`|f9f27Cmhaa	What the cop means by saying its a civil matter is that your best recourse is to sue the person.  Even if there is a law on the books, that does not mean that any prosecutor will bother making a case of it.  You can hire a lawyer to try to press them to bring criminal charges, but in the end, you probably just best off filing a lawsuit, if that's what you're inclined to do.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	When there is a tort cause of action or a breach of contract. If a crime affects another person, there is usually a tort that they can use to sue on. Like if someone assaults you, they could be criminally charged and then you could sue them for the tort of 'battery.'    Here, you might have a breach of contract case, which only results in the party that breached, making the other party whole again as if the contract was fully performed.    Another cause of action might be trespass to chattel or conversion.  A trespass means they might of hurt your stuff but you could get it back. If they destroyed your stuff then it would be a tort of conversion.|`|sM6sIjhBaa	Its a civil matter I just went through that myself a few years ago.  Becasue i gave permission to the person to have my property in their possesion it turned into a civil matter and the cops wouldnt do anything about it.|`|JHO6DlH0aa	There is a fine line between criminal statues and civil issues.  The Deputy is following his training and stating it to be a civil issue because of the contract.  Small Claims Court would be an option.|`|AA11622716	If you think someone stole something, say so.  Your comments are not at all clear.  It sounds like you were storing stuff at someone else's place, and that stuff is missing.  Theft usually involves an unlawful taking.  The duty of a bailee to care for goods is a civil matter.

AA10045620	Be very, very careful with this supposed relationship.  She is now saying that she wants to stay in her country, but should you get married, she would want to move to your country for citizenship.  She will also want to bring her family 'over.'    Perhaps you could get a tourist visa.

hmA8nfA2aa	Patrol officers certainly don't have any less potential or smarts than investigators. Some patrol officers are smarter than some investigators, and some investigators are smarter than some patrol officers.    If you want to be a police detective, you must first become a police officer. However, you can become a federal criminal investigator without being a police officer. You often need at least a four year degree. You can qualify for many federal criminal investigator jobs with an advanced degree. It helps if you have served in the military. Check out the link below.    http://jobsearch.usajobs.gov/jobsearch.a...    There are many things to consider when thinking about becoming a law enforcement officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a law enforcement officer.|`|T9l6QWlcaa	Maybe, maybe not.  You are only in first year.  Give it to when you graduate and you and your professors will know if that should be considered so you can better understand and apply your knowledge in the profession exactly what police go through while on duty to overcome "you don't know what it's like to be out there".|`|tDeYQV6raa	lol a school in chicago known for rolling out some of the finest law enforcement personal.      lolololololololoololololololololololol...|`|OVUkamlpaa	So,  you are too good to be a patrol officer? With that attitude, I think you need to look into another line of work.    Patrol is the backbone of any law enforcement agency. To be that condecending, you have a lot to learn.|`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	if non of your instructors answered this question for you then you most likely don't have any instructors that were cops. yes you have to be a cop usually around 5 years to get the better oppertunities like detective or swat. sometimes longer and in some rare cases they will make acceptions if you dont have 5 years experience.
AA10206116	Typically, it's from the time you are hired until the time you are fully trained in. It could mean a disciplinary term too, but I have only heard that from a handful of people.|`|YupMCYHlaa	When you first start on a job, any job, it's understood that you are probational for the first 90 days.  During that time, if you screw up, you can be just dismissed on the spot, they don't need an excuse, a written warning, or any of the things companies usually use to protect themselves from lawsuits.  But the probationary period works both ways.  If you find the job wasn't what you expected, or if it was misrepresented, or if you get a better offer from another job application, you can leave immediately, you don't need to give 2 weeks notice.    In some cases an employee can be put on probation.  Like if you get a bad review or they catch you sleeping on your desk or something like that.  Usually there is a 'written warning' so when you get fired they can say you were warned.     But in most places you work 'at will', meaning that they can let you go at any time and not need a good reason.  You sign a paper to this effect when you're hired so you can come back and sue them for 'wrongful termination'.  (But you still can!)|`|YcgEmrRkaa	It's stupid.  Everyone should have a job and there should be no probation|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	When you first get hired some place there is a learning curve.  They get to see how you perform.  You get to learn whose azz must be kissed and how often.  If you show up early everyday.  You do yours and others jobs.  If you suck up enough and kiss enough azz.  You may become permanent after the probation period.|`|AA10026511	in some place (police or fire fighter their probie preiod is up to year  other companies usually 90 days|`|z88IMXNFaa	Typically, it's a period during which you are not eligible for benefits and can be terminated at any time.
2OBP8fqJaa	My understanding is you can go down to the courthouse and fill out a form which asks a lot of questions and dates things happened. If you feel you can convince a judge that you are in danger by some proof of evidance then go for it. If you have to, you maybe can get your son to testify about something said to him or something he saw, but don't put any words in his mouth or it will come back to bite you. Get together all your info ASAP and go for it. Better to have tried and failed then not tried and something bad happen. In the meantime depending on your sons age explain to him pleasantly and calmly in a way he can understand to stay away from whomever if he is approached.|`|EvlPzrVOaa	each state its different for ROs and you jsut go to the courthouse to fill out the paperwork. then the Ro has to be delivered to the person preferably the sheriff. this in turn makes a court date for the 2 of you for you to esplain why you need it. now if it was immediate harm the call the cops an the next day you can get a temp RO. then you go to court to get a longer ro.|`|9a9D7PXUaa	getting a restraining order can be one of the most difficult things do i have tried it before on my ex girlfriend who harassed me for over a year phone calls texts email shouting abuse in the street even threats against my life wouldn't get them to even consider it in the end i had to move away and change my Identity even my name and appearance i don't have that problem any more the best advice i can give is to do what i did but don't worry about family and friends im still in contact with my friends and family     the laws excuse with me was because the offender hasn't actually done anything (ie) they mean physical harm    it is worth keeping a log book write down every time you get harassed by any forms of contact (ie) phone text email face to face write down the time date and location of the incident and names of witnesses in the log book and save any written messages from the offender     today the courts cant be bothered not even having my house broken into by my ex got them to do anything in fact i got in trouble because the idiot injured herself     citizens advice said she committed a crime from the start but the law cant be asked     restraining order you would be lucky if they gave out a caution    that's the best advice i can give you hope that helps
SOveWKxkaa	see a recruiter|`|AA10025824	I believe that would get you in as a supply officer, or something of that nature.|`|Run7dyraaa	Yes, with a BA you will go in as an officer. It's ROTC. Officers don't have to scream. They make more money!|`|tDeYQV6raa	to answer your question.  yes you can join the air force after you get your degree.        to fix one of your misconceptions, officers don't scream at people, they give orders and senior enlisted personnel scream at people.        there is only two kinds of starting positions, officers and enlisted.  so no you can't join as something else.       you can take AFROTC in college if you know you want to join the air force, and what that means is during the summer you will do some military training, and once a week you will exercise with your fellow AFROTC cadets.  and the air force will give you a huge scholarship to go to school.        just know that officers don't scream more than anyone else, they just tell people what to do. (in a calm voice).|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Yes after you get your BA you can join the AF. You can become an officer & trust me AF officers don't scream & yell at anyone. You have that concept from movies I imagine. But w/ a BA you can still go in as an enlisted person. If you go in as enlisted you will go in as an E2 or E3. But w/ a BA you would go through OTS & get out a 2nd Lt.    I would recommend that you seriously think about using your BA to advance your military career.  Do you know what you want to do? Do you want to do just 4 years or possible a long term commitment?|`|nKDhM0sYaa	Then enlsit first then get your bachelor's, otherwise, go through AFROTC and become an officer.

He blames America solely for the so-called global warming! He did not complain about the summer games being held in one of the most polluted cities in the world, and by that of course I am refering to Beijing, China!     Al Gore is the biggest hypocrite of the first order!|`|in936M0Faa	the saddest part is that somewhere someone actually believes him|`|dYyiG90caa	I think he's a Mooch.

Wait, excuse me -- Now, it's called "Climate Crisis" lol :)    --- Have been under High Scrutiny and he uses an distorts a mixture of Facts, to make his Case.    Now -- He wants to spend Billions for More Advanced Satellites to Confirm his Theories --     Does this mean the Current Satellites he based his "Beliefs" on were NOT Accurate ?? lol :))    There are Fair arguments on Both Sides of this Debate --    But, Right now -- the only the "rushing at us at Great Speed" is most likely a Asteroid !!    I use to think this was just a "Pet Project" of His -- but over the Years, I realize that this is His "bread & butter" --     In other words -- His main source of INCOME !!    Personally, I think he either has America's Priorities, "out of Order" or He Truly Believes his own B.S.    In a way -- I thought it was a bit Shameful...     The "Senator" Al Gore from 1988, was the ONE Conservative Democrat who was really "on-top" of our Issues, when he ran against Dukakaka for the 1988 Nomination for the Presidency.    But, ever since He became V.P. under Clinton, he has Gradually changed into a mixed-up Liberal.    Just my opinion...  .

Maybe you'll work for that, most Americans won't. One of just many reasons Immigration needs to be reformed.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	This plan might backfire on him. The unions were behind him 100%. If they streamline the immigration process to combat illegal immigration that would mean a huge workforce of LEGAL immigrants that will do the same job as a union employee for far less money and less benefits.  Sounds more like a Republican plan if you think about it that way.  I (a Republican) have been saying for years that we need to streamline the immigration process so these people can come here legally, pay taxes and so on to the benefit of all concerned.This would make the goods and services cheaper right here in America.Competition is good in that regard.  This might shake up the stranglehold the unions have had for decades.  You are right though, Americans by birth should have first shot at jobs over immigrants.  In L.A. I used to look in the paper for jobs. When the news was saying there were no jobs and unemployment was high, there were still pages of want ads. These were jobs that no one wanted to do. Nasty jobs that didn't pay squat. We like steak here in the U.S. Foreigners will work those jobs and eat rice and/or beans and save their money to better themselves. Perhaps we Americans need to return to our old work ethic and not expect the government to take care of everything for us. If born Americans sucked up all those nasty low paying jobs there would be no opportunity for outsiders to come here for.  Proof? Go to your nearest high school or college and see how many want to work out in the hot sun picking fruit and vegetables for pennies in a pesticide rich environment.  Here in Reno right now we are at @8% unemployment. The casinos have lost so much business that they have had to let go most of their service jobs.People are cutting back their hours and taking pay reductions just to keep their jobs.  Funny thing, Most of the low end jobs are still filled by foreigners. McDonalds has mostly Spanish speakers working there. Why are there no white kids there? Most of the time the order taker can't even understand enough English to know what "no onions" means.Yet I see white kids all the time out skateboarding and just wandering around with nothing to do.  Back to the work ethic.  When I used to live in L.A. on certain street corners the Mexicans used to gather at 4:00 AM and just stand there waiting for "the truck" to come for day labor jobs. I never saw one single white kid out there.These guys were willing to get up that early, get dressed and be ready to work all day with no guarantee of any work at all and for probably less than minimum wage if they got anything at all.Now THAT is a work ethic!|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Americans should fill them.

To kill all foreigners in all those countries?  (Are you aware of that there are a lot of Americans living abroad and working in foreign countries?)     I think it is not about foreigners and immigration. It is about fault economic system that creates unimployment here in the US and other countries.    We will see less and less jobs in the future. The world governments have to do something about it before people all over the world become starving and killing each other because they have nothing to eat.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	key statement is "employers cannot fill."    that means they've tried but cannot find workers for.    do you realize that engineers, doctors, and computer programmers are in very very high demand but we are graduating fewer and fewer of them??|`|t0mb150gaa	We are already losing enough jobs to immigrants..these jobs should go to the american people who are struggling as it is.

Then to watch Sarah Palin getting snubbed by her own side when she was the most conservative runner in the race is just a disgrace. Both parties have been hijacked by the elitist snobs in America and both are dangerous when it comes to where America is headed, because an elitist wouldn't know free market or the limited place of Government if they were told it.  So both parties have alot in common at the moment, they are both spending out grandchildrens money, they are both more worried about thier pork than the American citizen, they are both elitists scum that think more of thier own self importance than where America will end up.  The last presidents from both side that didn' t lose site of what makes America great that I respect is Reagan and JFK.

Since the 700 billion bailout was actually split with 350 being spent by Bush and the rest left for the incoming President to use it actually means he will increase the deficit.  Since then 800 billion second stimulus, 475 billion the House wants to add to this years budget because of Bush cuts in education, entitlement programs, and infrastructure (you would have thought that would have been funded in the Stimulus Package?) plus I know it is just nickel and dime the 900million for Gaza was not budgeted for and where is it coming from? so actually the deficient this year will be much higher then even what Bush is "responsible" for.  Really interested in seeing the budget being prepared now and seeing how universal health care can be funded without creating a bigger deficit, raising a lot more taxes then stated (look at "indirect" taxes on people like business, corparartion, exise taxes, sin taxes and fees and not just income taxes) and seeing the savings from the war in Iraq if you are sending the troops to Afghanistan instead.  Actually more troops will be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan combined then before since the increase in Afghanistan is happening before any decrease in Iraq.  The troops coming home now are regular rotation and not early because of and the 17,000 to Afghanistan are additional.  Funny how the President Obama plan to withdraw the troops from Iraq is almost exactly the Bush plan and treaty that was already signed prior to the election but don't worry President Obama and his supporters will take full credit for doing it in the promised six, I mean sixteen and now I mean nineteen month time frame.  Note to PaperMage:  What he keeps talking about, the cutting all earmarks and waste, is called a line item veto and the only problem is he does not have the Constitutional or legal authority to do that.  He can Veto or sign and those are the two options; Congress has never and will never give a President line item veto because it becomes too much power over them.  Last serious try was during the Reagan years and Democrats and Republicans both opposed it with some Senators even threatening to go to court as it being an unconstitutional usurpation of their power.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	He's blowing smoke out his ***. <br>  <br>  Like doubling our alternative energy output in 3 years (common consensus is 2 decades), having all our troops out if Iraq in 18 months, creating 2.5  er   5   uhm  3-4   oh crap   2.7562358 million jobs.<br>  <br>  Congress is not done writing 1/2 trillion dollar spending bills.

I have no doubt that many of these programs are conservative projects.<br>  <br>  It's a win-win situation for the president, and actually quite clever.  He gets to make a big promise that sounds both wonderful and achievable (making the previous administration look even more foolish for not having done it already), and any opposition to it almost certainly would come from the Right.  If he can't fulfill this promise (as opposed to the other promises he's somehow already managed to break), then it's entirely the fault of the Republican Party, and if he can fulfill it, then it would mean the end to countless programs that may or may not be devastating to the country if he actually does it.<br>  <br>  Either way, he still gets to carry the title of "Deficit hawk" which is so coveted by the GOP.  Personally, I'd feel much better knowing exactly which programs he intends to cut.|`|kG5ms0PLaa	Since his first Yearly Deficit is going to be close to 2 Trillion Dollars,all he has to do is cut the yearly deficit to 1 Trillion Dollars and he would keep his promise.Of course that would also be a doubling of Bush's yearly deficits,which would put the National Debt at 17-18 Trillion by the end of Obama's 2nd Term.<br>  <br>  Obama666|`|TpdVba4baa	No, he's talking about the national debt 4 years from now, which will be quadrupled.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	I think your safe on body fat. I'm in the Navy and my max weight allowed is 216 pounds at 6'3" tall. I believe that you are allowed a max weight of 212 pounds if your 6'2" tall. So if you weight about 190 pounds, you have a cushion of approximately 22 pounds which is excellent    If your really stressed at knowing how much your body fat actually is you can get a basic reading by measuring your neck and your waist. You subtract your neck reading from your waist to get the body fat percentage. Example: Waist is 38 and neck is 17 means 38-17=21. This person would have 21 % body fat. I think you have to have less than 23 % body fat for most services.    As a side note, if your planning on joining the Army, I believe they are waiving body fat/weight standards right now. Check with a recruiter for additional information.|`|AA10123414	You are 23.8 to 24.4.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	They check the body fat on everybody who is over their maximum weight for the service they are applying for.

SI8NXzNSaa	The war with Iraq, which dragged on far longer than it should have.    The idea with the invasion of Iraq, which it was known would cause a downturn in the economy, was expected to be countered by oil getting cheaper and more available, as part of the looting of Iraq.    Unfortunately, W did not anticipate that the oil companies would demand Iraq be quite so stable to do business, and there was also a underestimation on the amount of  resistance, mostly due to the influence of Iran.    With the war dragging on, and the downturn this would do to the economy not being counteracted by cheap oil, W just continued the course, and upped the ante in an effort to get Iraq stable enough for the oil companies to begin the looting. Unfortunately, the drop in production from removing Iraq from the production picture, with an increase demand for oil in Asia, mostly due to Asian government subsidies, caused a large rise in oil prices, this linked with a weakness in the economy, caused a cascade effect, which began with the housing foreclosures, causing the housing market to drop, which then had a cascade effect due to so much of the banking community being linked with a rising housing market.    This is where we get to today, with the desperate bailouts of the banking community. Now, it's very difficult to say Obama can do anything to drag the economy to of where it is...the main thing is to try and slow the decay, until it can begin to rebound, without doing too much additional damage. Now Obama's new deal/spending boost/tax cuts has a chance to at least stop the decay, however, things are already pretty heavily mortgaged, mostly due to republicrat deficit spending since the days of Reagan, the well may just be too tapped for it to have a positive effect, however, continuing in the manner that W was going, would be even more disastrous, since that is what brought us to this point.|`|AA12191521	all of the changes to the law that opened the loopholes that were exploited to create this mess were signed into law by president Clinton. When the republicans were in charge of Congress and the white house none of these problems had really come to a head yet. But warning signs were there. However every effort to put stricter regulations on the housing market were shouted down by House democrats. The republicans could have ignored them and acted anyway. That is a failing of sorts. But the true scope of the problem did not become apparent until the Democrats were in charge of Congress. And a failing economy was great for them. They had no reason to fix it. Bad economy means the President's party will suffer. So they let it keep getting worse and worse and pointing the finger at Bush. But all he could do is sign laws that congress sent to him. And they sent nothing, so he could do nothing. Added to all of this were the dire predictions of Obama telling everyone that the economy was terrible and broken beyond repair. In economics belief creates reality. And Obama's prophesy of doom was more convincing than Bush's reassurance that everything would be ok. That too could be seen as a failing. He was not persuasive enough to shift the tide of public opinion. So despite all his effort to stop it, the democrats succeeded in tanking the economy and pinning the blame on him. This gave them the edge they needed to score big wins in both houses and the presidency. Now that they are in power they have to try to undo the mess they made to put themselves in power. But its always easier to break something than it is to put it back together. The recession will end when everyone believes it is over. Which means you have to make people believe it before it can become true. You have to lie to them. And when enough people believe it, the lie becomes true. Obama is a good liar. So he has a chance of turning this around. But its going to be difficult. I guess Bush just wasn't dishonest enough.|`|evEJxv06aa	first he drained our country's buget than got a lot of people lay of from there jobs he only helped the big busniess and never thinked about the small busniess always did some thing that never helped the country or the people got the gas prices so high that some people stop going out there houses or some started taking buses or some started taking public transit to work and he bombed bagdad and killed innocent children and people just think how they felt but he never cared and lots of our troops got or getting killed because of him so thats what he did and i hope obama will fix every thing make things right.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	enough of him already!|`|4zijn0cgaa	He did not veto Democratic Congressional financial plans that made banks lend money to people that did not qualify for home loans.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	im a total socialist liberal so i did not like bush at all. but to his credit it was not JUST him. id say his biggest impact were the wars that have raised the deficit to 1 trillion. other than that, deregulation of banks, financial institutions on wall street was done with both parties. i think at the times they did this there were more republicans in the senate , but i think its about 60-40 repubs. also, when something this big happens, its not just one source|`|Gr99OjQuaa	no one ruined the economy  its a free market economy thats gone global so one person or party cannot ruin it.     world economies go through ups and downs and have been doing for a long long time. its nothing new|`|diCASlUXaa	drained our budget with the unjustful Iraq war and tax cuts for the top 1%.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	He didn't, the economy was doing great until the dems. took over Washington.|`|eiVlnKgNaa	FREE POCKET CONSTITUTION  http://www.askheritage.org/Premium.aspx|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Barney Frank killed the economy with his oversight of Fannie May and Freddie Mack.|`|iqGY5jvfaa	Bush did not have foresight and did not show sense of urgency to address these problems early on. However, it was series of events to include liberal type policies that help bring our economy down.    First we had high fuel prices cause we had stupid policies that were not pro domestic energy i.e. no off coast drilling, no new nuke facilities....    We also raised the price of whole sale goods due to ethanol requirement which had an affect on corn related bi-products    The housing issue is both the Government and the Peoples fault. People forgot to appreciate the value of budgeting. There is no excuse how family members lost their houses. They mismanaged their own pocket books.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a US Government quasi private company had poor oversight and had many conflicts of interest from members of Congress...to include Barney Frank and Senator Dodd...and Barack Obama...and Franklin Raines..    Liberal Policies of forcing banks to give loans to low income people created an artificial housing bubble...which collapsed as inflation was taking over and recession came to fruition...    President Bush and the Republicans did not adhere to fiscal conservative philosophy during the first six years. They were lethargic and showed no initiative to foresee these problems.    This time in history deserves and in depth analysis...There is more than just President Bush....it was our overall underlying philosophy that end up destroying itself.     but a general statement could be made that it was Government Interference and tweeking the free market system end up hurting us....this includes over taxation.    The idea that Bill Clinton left us a surplus is simplistic too...  The Republican Controlled Congress gave Bill Clinton a Balanced Budget...and it can be argued that Bill Clinton mismanagement of the bureaucracy end up costing Americans in the long run with our nation's security at stake.   911 was a result of flawed Clinton Administration policies.

It was caused by multiple factors, including (but not limited to): government regulations forcing lenders to give loans to risky people to buy homes, those risky people defaulting on their loans (which flooded the housing market with available properties), construction slowing down due to the new availability of said homes, and a ripple effect from there (more unemployed leads to more unemployed).

He did the right thing and put in in the hands of congress so take the issue up with all who voted for it. Bush did not ruin the economy. It took mistakes by many people to do it. Every president from Carter to present was part of the problem. Some played a bigger role than others but Bush was not even in the bottom three. Carter lifted restrictions on financial institutions to try and stimulate the economy.|`|f260fecd5ca5dc4eb4cded2d66649c61aa	Obviously you aren't the only one who needs an education if someone thinks our country was doing great until the democrats came in.  When Clinton (democrat) was done serving we had SURPLUS.  Now we owe trillions to China as they are funding the war for us through loans. I guess you missed the war we had to invent because of weapons of mass destruction?  There were no weapons of mass destruction, it was all a con. I guess you didn't know we have beenkilling innocent women and children bombing Bagdad? I knew we weren't going to live happily ever after after all of that.  Things are bad because we all contributed to making it that way.  America has been a group effort.|`|AA12022134	Bush started the job Obama will finish it.|`|FKqtAhjraa	I don't really understand myself how one person,even if he is the President of the United States can cause or fix the economy.  I don't know what the answer is, but it doesn't look like the bail out is working.|`|JQwL50JMaa	Well, he really didn't.  That's just what the Democrats and others who hate Bush claim because they're very partisan.    There are a number of reasons why the economy has failed miserably.  It started when the center of our financial world, the World Trade Center, was destroyed.  The war on terror has cost this country quite a bit of money...and we must remember that Congress approved it.  We can't lay all the blame on Bush for this.  If we had just remained in Afghanistan, the war would have probably still been high dollar, since bin Laden likes to duck and hide all over the place.    Then there is the crooked banks and mortgage lenders and stupid people taking on loans they KNEW they couldn't afford.  That really screwed us last year.  Again, this isn't Bush's fault because he, among many other people (democrat and republican) actually did try to warn us about this happening several years ago.    There is little the President can actually do in these situations because Congress is actually more powerful than he.    The only thing we can HONESTLY blame Bush for is believing that the initial surge in Iraq was a good idea.  He was advised against it, but asked Congress for their permission and they agreed to it.  They approved it.    And the answer to the question whether Obama will fix things:  No.  He was one of three Democratic Senators who took A LOT of money from Fannie and Freddie. The other two were Chris Dodd and John Kerry.  If I can remember correctly, I think he took over $1,000,000 from them.    There is video evidence from an event with the Congressional Black Caucus in which the C.E.O. of Fannie Mae praises Obama, calls him a friend of Fannie Mae.  Then he corrects himself and calls Obama family.  I believe this was in 2005?  Feel free to look up this information.    This is one of the main reasons I don't trust he will do anything for this economy since he is one of the top three Democrats who took money from the very people who caused the mortgage crisis in this country.|`|CvFajKPUaa	He didn't fight hard enough to stop the dumborats.  Sure he told Barney Frank to pay attention and not let the mortgage meltdown to get to where it did but he couldn't get ol' Frank to do what was right.  Guys like Obama and their work with criminal groups like ACORN forced lenders to give loans to people who had no business be qualified for so much as a cell phone plan.  After the disastrous collapse of the real estate market, which is 25% of the economy, many other sectors couldn't survive.    Obama thinks taxing more, which is taking money away from the people who earned it,which in effect means they can't spend it or put it back into the economy, will do the country good.  Funny how BO says spending tax payers money will spur the economy but tax payers spending money won't help when the government wastes more than it helps will do anything good.  Apparently BO never took as much as Econ 101 when he was learning who to lie cheat and steal in college.    BO will do nothing but create more debt while paying back all the people who bought him his office.  Wait and see who much George Soros, BO's puppet master and owner, will make when the USD falls like a rock in value.  G. Soros made his billions trading currency.  Looks like BO would rather pay back the one's who pull his strings than to actually help those who can create jobs and in doing so pull the US economy back to pre-2006 days.    Bush didn't stop the likes of B. Frank, ACORN, Obama etc. from making horrible decisions that lead to the collapse of the real estate market and then everything else.  BO will not fix anything but he will actually make things much worse, his actions in the past few years have already done more damage than anyone one can begin to comprehend.|`|qDuXqxlKaa	It wasn't solely Bush. The fault rests with a lot of people--Democrats AND Republicans.    But Bush's style of laissez faire economics--deregulation, nonintervention in the market, anti-union attitudes--seriously exacerbated a problem we were already having. And the billions spent in Iraq didn't help the situation.    I'm linking you to the Glass-Steagall Act, which was put in place after the New Deal to separate commercial and investment banking, to avoid precisely this kind of economic collapse. It was repealed in 1999 through a bill proposed by two Republicans who argued that deregulation, speculation, and open credit markets were the way to go. Unfortunately, their gamble turned out to be very wrong.     Bush didn't author the bill that overturned the act, and he wasn't responsible for the bill passing, either. He does subscribe to that kind of noninterventionist economic philosophy that allowed the problem to get worse, but it would be silly to put the responsibility for our economic crisis on his shoulders alone.    And no, I don't think Obama alone can fix it. I'm hopeful that he will take steps in the right direction, but it'll take a serious bipartisan effort and a big step away from neoliberal/neoconservative economics and toward a more Keynsian New Deal-era plan that builds infrastructure WHILE creating jobs.|`|WfPsGCxtaa	He started 2 wars and did Absolutely nothing to control spending... in fact he cut taxes and encouraged discretionary spending, destroying a budget surplus.    Obama can't fix it he is is making all the wrong moves... like spending too much to get little in return.|`|4YcLm2QYaa	He didn't. The Democrats meddled in the credit markets requiring banks to make loans to their powerbase, you know, deadbeats. And when they couldn't pay they went back to Congress crying. Now you, the American taxpayer will get to pay for their house. Assuming you pay taxes and aren't a deadbeat as well.   I feel sorry for you kids. I'm older and I lived through the seventies, but you guys have never seen a bad economy...EVER! Now you're going to get a very painful education. Change? Sure thing pal. Jimmy Carter ran on change too and that's exactly the kind of change you're going to get.|`|F28BfJKjaa	America messed it up. Everyone is too greedy. They want to make a lot of money and spend it on cheap items that were slave labored in China. Well, problem is if everything we buy is made in China we don't have factory jobs. You're 100 times more likely to work in a factory than you are to work in an office      Bush had a dream that everyone would own their own house. Put all these cuts into place, lowered the amount of effort people had to put into the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to gain a high score. Let banks get a high score from the CRA minimizing the need for CRA watch dogs and the banks handed out a bunch of cash to people who couldn't pay them.       People blame the CRA, but the CRA only had dealt with a very, very small amount of sub prime loans.      In a nutshell banks used this ability to get an easy high score from the CRA. They gave out "predatory loans" in which they may have knew people couldn't pay back... Which would increase interest, the home buyer would lose the home... Still owe a ton of money, and that house get's thrown back on the market for the next sucker. But guess what, Nobody is buying cause they all owe a life time of debt on housing loans...      So, Bush got what he wanted. Everybody did at one point own their home. But no one ever though that it would only last until he left office.      Oh yeah, and we can't forget the war. Pushed them terrorists out of Iraq and closer to Israel.
AA11598520	More the opposite.

Keep writing him letters, and he'll let you know more when he finds out I'm sure.

Naturally, she is a Democrat and was first decided upon by the Democratic Caucus.  Then, it went to the full House, where the Republicans offered their candidate for Speaker (Rep. John Boehner of Ohio).  Then each member voted according to party and Pelosi won.  Boehner became the House Minority (Republican) Leader.    From a political standpoint, she helped many, many Democrats get elected or re-elected to the House when they were in the minority, making her greatly responsible for the Democrats gaining a majority in the House.  She was the natural choice because she had offered stronger leadership and had more political markers out than any other majority party candidate for Speaker.    The "brightest star in the democratic sky"?  NO, that honor goes to Barack Obama.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Her job is not about popularity . . her job is administrative, making sure the House runs smoothly according to procedure . . which means the Speaker does not debate like the other Senators.

Dissent, rebellion, and all-around hell-raising remain the true duty of patriots.    I intend to be a PATRIOT during the whole Obama administration.|`|zrggGS2Caa	Bush had the highest approval ratings in history following 9-11. He maintained high approval ratings until he took us into Iraq and it turned into a fiasco due to poor planning. He even got re-elected.    The difference now is that most conservatives won't give Obama time to even get his feet wet. In my 55 years I've never seen a President get beat up so badly so early by the pundits. But then, no other President had to deal with a network (FOX) so devoted to destroying him.    Republicans need to remember that they lost convincingly. I can only laugh while I listen to them whine about Obama.|`|Uyup7lBDaa	The spending is very different, Bush's spending of the massive surplus after he took office went directly into american pockets (what Repubs were pushing for the $800 b. to be used for again) and did nothing to stimulate the economy, just like the stimulus bill did nothing. Just like reganonmics did nothing.    I'm not going to say support Obama because he's our president, that would make me hypocritical, I didn't support Bush because the record actually shows his economic plans from 2001-2002 actually hurt the economy, his tax-cuts hurt our funding for infrastructure and No Child Left Behind left states needing to raise their own taxes to fund it since there was either no funding, or very little provided but the program was federally mandated.    Obama hasn't even been in office a full month, so its hard to criticize, it took years for the error of the tax cuts and NCLB program to show up in the economy (not that I'm saying the economic recession is Bush's fault, its not, he recieved far too much blame, just like Clinton recieved far too much credit for the surplus)    So to answer your question in a long verbose way...You can say what you want about the president, its part of living in a some-what free country, but I, personally, find it hard to critiscize a president before they even get their ears wet, know what I mean ?      Rationalize your criticism with results|`|Uaoep16Qaa	im a total socialist liberal and ill tell u, i like obama more than bush because my philosophies align more with him than bush.  but i completely agree with u! u shouls question obama! i wouldnt say'want him to fail' like rush limbaugh, same as , i didnt want bush to fail either because look at our situation now, if anything, i wanted him to smarten up and do better! so i dont think anyone should root for any president to fail, its stupid because indirectly ur just hurting urself, the whole country is tied together.  but the founding fathers said, it is ur duty as a democratic citizen to challenge and question ur leaders, or else what did they fight for? ur gov't answers to u so u should challenge obama!|`|X1yZOMYHaa	It's not the same method Bush was applying. TARP was a Wall-Street bailout plan with virtually no transparency. This is a stimulus bill, for public spending and tax cuts. Just about every western democracy is drafting or has passed some form of a stimulus bill to deal with the economic crisis.     As for opposing Obama, you should take it on a case by case basis, even if you disagree with him most of the time. It's fine to oppose him on the basis of ideas, and not vote for him in 2012, but if he has a good idea you shouldn't oppose it just because you don't like the politician. That's partly what's wrong with politics. Acknowledge a good or bad idea when you see one.|`|JH2GqpA2aa	I'm going to give you a simple answer, I don't care about nationalism nor worship.

The minimum amount of THC required to have a perceptible psychoactive effect is about 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight.[16] The most common short-term physical and neurological effects include increased heart rate, lowered blood pressure, impairment of psychomotor coordination, concentration, and short-term memory. Long-term effects are less clear.  Smoking of cannabis is the most harmful method of consumption, since the combination of inhalation of smoke from organic materials such as tobacco, wood, gasoline and cannabis can cause various health problems. However, recent studies have shown that using a vaporizer for cannabis consumption appears to eliminate almost all of the health problems and objections related to cannabis use.  Comparison of physical harm and dependence regarding various drugs (the British medical journal The Lancet[25])A 2007 study by the Canadian government found cannabis smoke contained more toxic substances than tobacco smoke.[26] The study determined that marijuana smoke contained 20 times more ammonia, and five times more hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen oxides than tobacco smoke. In spite of this, recent studies have been unable to demonstrate a direct link between lung cancer and frequent direct inhalation of marijuana smoke. While many researchers have failed to find a correlation,[27][28] some researchers still conclude that marijuana smoke poses a higher risk of lung cancer than tobacco.[29] Some studies have even shown that the non-psychoactive ingredient CBD found in marijuana may be useful in treating breast cancer.[30]  Cannabis use has been assessed by several studies to be correlated with the development of anxiety, psychosis and depression,[31][32] however, no causal mechanism has been proven, and the meaning of the correlation and its direction is a subject of debate that has not been resolved in the scientific community. Some studies assess that the causality is more likely to involve a path from cannabis use to psychotic symptoms rather than a path from psychotic symptoms to cannabis use,[33] while others assess the opposite direction of the causality, or hold cannabis to only form parts of a "causal constellation", while not inflicting mental health problems that would not have occurred in the absence of the cannabis use.[34][35]  Studies have also shown links between heavy long-term use (over five joints daily over several years) and incidence of heart attacks, strokes, as well as abnormalities in the amygdala and hippocampus regions of the brain.    Scientists have learned a great deal about how THC acts in the brain to produce its many effects. When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs throughout the body.    THC acts upon specific sites in the brain, called cannabinoid receptors, kicking off a series of cellular reactions that ultimately lead to the high that users experience when they smoke marijuana. Some brain areas have many cannabinoid receptors; others have few or none. The highest density of cannabinoid receptors are found in parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thoughts, concentration, sensory and time perception, and coordinated movement.1    Not surprisingly, marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Research has shown that marijuanas adverse impact on learning and memory can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off.2 As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time.    Research on the long-term effects of marijuana abuse indicates some changes in the brain similar to those seen after long-term abuse of other major drugs. For example, cannabinoid withdrawal in chronically exposed anim|`|Tsz7To6Iaa	one reason is that marihuana has an immediate effect on your reflexes and train of thought but i know on the other hand tobacco kills your lungs on the long run.

You may want to start before boot camp and see if you will be able to do it.|`|QskM0Mfsaa	now is a good time  yes you will travel  you are not required to swim in the ocean but you will have to know how to swim and if you don't know before you go into boot camp they might hold you back a week so you can learn.  im not sure what logistics does in the navy.   with that job you could go almost anywhere. but transportation sounds like a shore duty type of job  USN 6 years|`|tDeYQV6raa	1) as good as any, we are in tough economic times, and the navy is a good steady job.    2) Yes, the vast majority of jobs in the navy are done at sea.    3) You never have to swim in the ocean unless you go into special forces, at boot camp you swim in a pool.    4) in the job of transportation & logistics you will: get Sailors, equipment,  and supplies to the correct destination in an orderly and efficient manner.  Your office may be the deck of an aircraft carrier in the South China   Sea or the flight line of an air cargo terminal in Japan. Your ability  to study the tides and currents may prevent amphibious landing craft from  running aground during a beach landing. Or your knowledge of navigation and  bearings might save hours of time getting critical supplies to Sailors ashore. As a Sailor in the transportation and logistics field you might also:             *  Use and maintain navigational equipment         *  Take radar bearings and ranges        *  Pilot courses for safe navigation         *  Compute high and low tides and velocity of ocean currents         *  Organize and operate Navy post offices, ashore and afloat, receiving and issuing spare parts, clothing, and general supplies        *  Keep financial and inventory records for all parts in submarine storerooms and submarine-support, shore-based warehouses         *     Operate computer systems that provide logistic support information for submarine supplies and accounting functions         *     Keep fiscal records        *     Prepare inventory reports and correspondence        *     Keep official publications up to date      5) They will teach you at boot camp.  but if you can't learn quickly you will not pass boot camp, i personally recommend at least trying to learn how to swim before you enter.    6) You will most likely be on a ship, and it is completely random, you could go anywhere in the world.|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	1. Yes.  2. Yes.  3. No ocean where bootcamp is located. You only have to swim if you want to.  4. Logistics would be an SK in the Navy.  5. Yes they will teach you in bootcamp.  6. Anywhere that is available. Mostly larger bases and ships.|`|b1f68fe4a7602cd05ee10c7b596c5a1baa	It is about as good a time as any to join the Navy    I am not sure about the transportationtion and Logistics job sounds like a shore or large ship MOS    You learn to swim in a pool at Boot Camp, you will not leave boot camp until you learn to swim, so you will learn to swim    I had a ship oriented MOS (Navigation) and visited: Austrailia, Hong Kong, The Phillipines, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Curacao Costa Rica, and last and certainly least of all Diego Garcia during my four years.    Good Luck  Haze Grey and Under Way

mFa5ZDtcaa	In the Navy, "Skipper" refers to the Captain of a ship. But it is not a term used lightly. It is a very informal and somewhat familiar term.     In the Marines, "Skipper" is used as sort of a nickname for a Captain. Again, although not widely used by all, some don't like it (both Captains and others). I knew a Captain who hated to be called Skipper. I served under a Battalion C.O. who called all his Captains "Skipper". From him it was almost a term of endearment. He liked his Captains and we liked him. He was a great infantry officer and a leader of Marines. We would have followed him anywhere.    Marines are also called "Leather Necks". At one time, Marine uniforms had high leather collars (much earlier than James Dean). The purpose was to afford some protection from saber and sword slashes (aahh, the good ol' days).    Also common is the term "Devil Dogs". This name was given to the Marines by their enemy. In WWI, the Marines fought with such ferocity during The Battle of Belleau Wood in 1918. They were described as fighting "Teufel Hunden" or "Hounds from Hell".    Don't call a Marine a Jar Head unless you yourself are a Marine. Otherwise you might end up in the local ER.    The best thing to call a Marine? Simple...    Just call him Marine.      Semper Fi    "Semper Fidelis" is Latin for "Always faithful." Well known in the USA as the motto of the United States Marine Corps, this phrase, often shortened to "Semper Fi"|`|z42u6Tbkaa	We don't call each other skippers. You could call a captain skipper, but I doubt he'd like it too much.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	Jar head|`|ikBZvcGAaa	Semper Fi - Abbreviation for the Latin term Semper Fidelis which means Always Faithful. This is the slogan for the Marines because once you are a Marine you are always a Marine.     Marine Nicknames:  Jarhead - Comes from a stereotype that all marines are brainwashed (Not True). Also comes from the headgear used in an obsolete uniform.     Devil Dog - Comes from a rough translation of what the Germans called the Marines in WW1 and WW2 out of fear    Leather Neck - Comes from when wars were fought with swords, Marines used to wear a leather strand around their neck to protect them from sword blows.|`|wvLM7NwNaa	semper fi- means always faithful  Names are devil dog, leather neck, cpls and under are boots.

I'm waiting for my genuine leatherette carrying case now.|`|u23sBafTaa	I did hear it !  There are just so many ways we could take this conversation !  I will just leave it at very unprofessional and keep it clean. I also heard the Vice President asked for the number for the internet today?  They said McCain was out of touch for this right ?|`|qAL0CZIiaa	I say Olbermann should stop fondling Matthews during Jindal's conferences.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Chris Matthews is the best! Jindal is a joke.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	I agree with Matthews explanation for why he said it...you could tell immediately that the whole Jindal show was staged and scripted out as though Jindal WAS the President of the USA. You tie that in with the fact that Repubs are losers with stale old failed ideas and it was an "oh god" moment seeing them acting as though they are people of intelligence and importance.<br>  <br>  Speaking of acting....they should have let Arnold do the rebuttal because Jindal looked and sounded like a dark skinned version of Howdy Doody. (if anyone knows who HD was anymore).<br>  <br>  Of course Arnold supports Obama's stimuls plan...so he would not do it.<br>  <br>  And then to top it off, there I sat, a business owner who puts in 80 hours a week of hands on work, I pay all of my bills and never get in over my head on anything and to see this little dweeb standing there talking to ME about "personal responsibility" was also a huge part of the joke and another "oh god" moment as well.|`|peEHzKGDaa	Piyush Jindal is a neoCon loony who was used as the minority spokesperson to compare himself to Obama.

ZzXxRLWcaa	Surely you felt this way in the Bush years too though? They were the masters of bait and switch.    This is the real world, not theory though... President Obama is out there working for YOU (the 95% of America who matter). Just because some talking head somehwere pisses and moans because he thinks it should be one way or another, remember that these guys are PAID to cause trouble and rabble rouse for the sake of their ratings.    As far as the simulus bill... its not as rushed as everyones pretending. Barack had this up and out in everyones hands a week after the election... it wasnt a surprise. Plus it still has to pass the senate (and go through amendatory procedure) that'll take at least 2 more weeks.    And as far as calling out Rush? That was just a brilliant move to help him secure his party's position of strength. If he paints Rush Limbaugh as the face of the Republican party (which seems like its happening as there are no legit republican leaders in congress right now) then he assures democratic victory for the next 8-20 years.    That last one is a bit political I grant you, but clever and subtle none the less.|`|rRWzkffFaa	He should get paid for that too. What a genius (sarcasm intended).|`|Ze2MlcTUaa	OH YOU SEE SO MUCH TRY TURNING THAT BURNING INTELLECT ON THE NAZI PROPAGANDISTS YOU SUPPORT ...OR THEY SUCH GOOD ILLUSIONISTS THAT YOU ARE UNAWARE OF THERE SLIGHT OF HAND|`|grKtTRYtaa	The first stimulus plan?

KvTGiR6taa	not if he loves you..|`|3xTNOevjaa	Possibly, thats why you need to keep in touch with him as much as you can (perhaps mail often). Remember that there are girls in the Army and as well as wherever he goes. Gain his trust and you will be fine.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	More likely you would leave him for someone else on those long term deployments. I am sure you don't have nothing to worry about.|`|3c90e3772380f3b727bfbb0c621c8044aa	he most likely will not even have the time! it is however, your responsibility, as his girl friend, to support him as much as you can, act happy and never act stressed when you talk to him while he is on deployment, it will stress him out. It is hard yet exciting and honorable to have a member of the family or a boyfriend or girlfriend in the army, truly something to be proud of, I wouldn't worry about it if I where you.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	No way! You actually sound kind of selfish considering you're the one in civilian life being able to do whatever you want while he busts his *** in basic. DON'T bring something like this up to him, you sound ridiculous. You don't want him to think you don't trust him? You obviously don't if you have to come on yahoo answers for some reassurance.|`|CAdHpqyOaa	people will say lots of things. Every person is different and has a different life so who knows? Just stay close to him.|`|teKeLxX2aa	It is very unlikely your BF will drop you if he's in the Army. He's most likely going to be deployed to the Middle East (sooner rather than later) and while he's over there you're the only thing he'll be able to think about. It's not like Vietnam where there were brothels on every corner.<br>  <br>  Although I wouldn't immediately dismiss the likelihood that he might find someone while he's stationed, its doubtful that it'll develop into a meaningful relationship if you' two have been together for a while (maybe an affair or two). It's the military wives who are notorious for leaving the men while they're gone (It's called a Dear John letter).  <br>  <br>  Usually the women have the upper hand in your situation (because you still have the freedom to do as you wish). At some point it'll come across his head that if he doesn't treat you right, that you can leave him at any time and he'll be powerless to do anything. But considering all the stress your BF is going to be under, I would suggest doing your part in treating him well during the time you two will have together.|`|OGiSHHZaaa	I don't know your bf but from personal experience when guys and girls are lonely and in "need" they stray. Not everyone does but there are a few that do. Now in basic he'd have to be pretty sneaky to get away with it but it has been done. Just keep in regular contact with him and maybe you won't get that "Dear Jane" letter.|`|yKLBdoigaa	If you don't trust him, than how can he trust you? Did you think about how he will think the same thing about you? If you don't have faith in him, please, do him and yourself a big favor and break up now.|`|Tkcj5xV0aa	dont worry , if hes delpoyed, he gonna have more to worry about then cheating on his gf, he problay be thinking about you the whole time|`|ffa1fda68a6e2eb2bccd1bbfef3dd764aa	i wouldn't worry about him finding someone else in BASIC, however once he gets to ait and has a certain amount of freedom, that may be another story. sorry but true.<br>  however if you are both committed to one another, and haven't had  reasons to doubt in the past, i wouldn't worry about it honestly. but im not making any promises. <br>  also keep in mind that all his buddies in basic/ait and even drill sergeants will try to convince him that you're running around on him back home, just to mess with him head. write to him OFTEN, and try to keep his spirit (and his trust) high.<br>  <br>  i'd say that any guy who joins the military to "try to find another girlfriend" is a skank, and deserves all the bullshit he's about to deal with going into the military.<br>  and also as far as i know, they generally keep the women in a completely different area, different graduation even.|`|qubLyvcRaa	Trust me...if he's in basic right now, he hasn't got the time or the opportunity to find a girlfriend.  After basic, the strength of your relationship and your commitment to each other will determine your future together.  Beyond that, the services frown on fraternization (which is not to say it doesn't happen).  If you have a good relationship, that's something that he'll hang onto wherever he's ultimately deployed, and if it's a combat deployment, he'll need your love even more.  Your question is a little unusual.  It's usually the service person worrying about what's happening at home.  This is going to be a tough time for you.  The good news, however, is that you'll find out what your relationship is made of.  Stay in contact as much as you can.  Good luck to you (and to him, also).

We are no longer affixing ECNR stamp in passports. In fact it is not even printed in the new passport booklets. Currently, only ECR stamp is being put in  passports if applicant is not eligible for ECNR. However, you are entitled to ECNR status if you possess qualification of Matriculation or above. Even you can get ECNR status on the basis of provisional matriculation certificate if  the mark  sheets of all semesters of  your course are available with you.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	If there is no mention anywhere in the passport about emigration check  then obviously by implication no check would be required.For that matter,the check if insisted is required only for travel to the Gulf region.|`|llsYHgEgaa	ECNR stamp is no longer required effective oct 01, 2007/ any passport issued after that date does not have any stamp for ecnr as same is not required any more
e6b5ed9bbb22b169c2d72b52665dc7c3aa	Innocent until proven guilty is SOO misunderstood.  It only refers to the court proceedings. Here's an example.    You rob a bank with a gun. You go to jail and stay there with convicted criminals. You wear handcuffs to trial and guards take you away in the same manner.  You lose your job because you are a public figure.    Now, how is ANY of this unfair or unjust. Also, you misunderstand ethics and our justice system.  Public officials can be ousted for violations of ethics that are NOT criminal.  EXAPMPLE, a politician gives favors to friends.  This may not be criminal, but it sure is unethical.    Got it bright boy??|`|bXn6WGaXaa	Devil is too grandiose a title for Blagojevich. He's more of a minor imp. Obama wants to distance himself from Blagojevich and Antoin Rezko, so he called for his resignation and is acting all outraged over Blago trying to sell his old seat. The FBI have enough evidence to arrest and charge the man, and they will be indicting him soon. The Burris nomination didn't happen until Blago got into trouble, and he picked the least offensive guy he could find for the seat. Burris agreed to it because he has wanted a position like that one for decades. The senate confirmed him because he's just riding out the last two years of a six year term, and will be gone by the next general election. Blagojevich is innocent until proven guilty, and I do agree with that point, but it's not hard to connect the dots. Blago will join his predecessor in the federal pen and Illinois will go on to the next cretinous piece of filth, and the next, and the next.|`|YtcmXVpWaa	He is playing the race card with Burris.

Looks like a fish, swims like a fish, SMELLS LIKE A FISH.........a FISH!|`|1fxHHrWIaa	The FBI does not have to show the public any evidence until the trial.

He has not helped the people in Illinois in any way shape or form.Obama asked him to resign to save Blagojevich some embarassment and he could still have some dignity! Let me tell you about Blagojevich,When we had the big flood last Summer in 2008 many people lost their homes. He did nothing to help he didn't even come down to see the damage! Moreover he seemed like he didn't even care. And I can tell u right now the alligations against him are true. The FBI has concrete top secret evidence that is not for public eyes. And the recordings they have do have him talking about selling the senate seat.And there is a possiblity his wife was also involved. No it wasn't the fact that we had a black senator!  It is the simple fact he was caught trying to sell the senate seat!  Race isn't an issue on who becomes senator. So unless u know everything on what happenes in Illinois don't be accusing Illinois government of racial discrimination against who becomes senator!|`|VQCsOpIbaa	Any time someone in high public office has serious charges brought against them, they are asked to retire while the situation is being clarified. In most cases, they are welcome to resume public office once all charges are cleared. It keeps from having a corrupt person in charge, and from the public losing confidence in the system. (If they had any to start with.)|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	too simplistic  of an opinion , haven't you heard the tapes of his admitting to not only trying to "sell" off the office position, but also saying that he isn't worried about anyone taping him saying it ?  Just how much info do you need before you can make a valid opinion. We don't have to wait for a jury of one's peers and can't judge for ourselves if we know what we know. Are you not aware that there have been guilty people that have been let go and innocent people currently in our jails today ?  Why else would you think that they moved in before he actually accomplished the sell off ? If they had let it happen, there would be no question he was guilty. Right now all they have is him saying he would...but since they moved in, he actually didn't have a chance to actually do it. So the question is....was  a crime really committed ?  For those so shallow as not to weigh all the evidence..you might say no....but that's why he's the "devil" , because you know what his intension was, you know what he said........So you know what he stands for, you know he's corrupt, you know there's something wrong here.....but......since he didn't actually do it...the best you can do is kick him out of office to prevent any future abuses. The early move in prevented criminal activity...which is suspicious in itself.|`|vz5iGYVqaa	Well, I think you should be worrying about other things like writing. You are a bit redundant in your word choices. MOREOVER (mocking you of course), you do not use correct grammar. An example is when you said that the FBI have not shown when it should be has not. Also, you spelled a simple word like evidence incorrectly. Come on dude. So next time you try to be smart and go on a political rant, consider a few basics of writing. You are most likely a liberal for supporting Blagojevich which, in my book at least, makes you all the more stupider. You Suck.|`|AA11065140	It's entirely true that he is innocent until proven guilty.  Unfortunately, the media has a tendency to ignore that fact on a regular basis.  There are all kinds of innocent people out there, who are believed to be guilty, simply because the media put a spotlight on them before guilt was proven.    We'll wait for him to have his trial to confirm.  But some of the not-so-problematic quotes that I've heard from the tapes seem to indicate that he's not truly innocent.  I'm not getting the impression that it's just a power play.    Obama asked him to resign as Governor so that the legal issues could be dealt with separately from the governmental issues.  Often, it's best to work on just one item at a time, even if it's only to give the constituents more faith in their government.  Additionally, considering that Illinois law says that proof of guilt is not necessary for impeachment, his resignation would have saved the taxpayers a bunch of money (not to mention time).    The FBI won't show the public the evidence, because that would put their case against him at risk.  Evidence is rarely released to the public, especially pre-trial.  It should be available at some point through the Freedom Of Information Act, but not until the trial is over.    I'd be very displeased to hear that he is guilty.  I'd also be very displeased to hear that the FBI would do this if he's not guilty.  I guess I hope the truth comes out, one way or another.

kx9zeEiFaa	This is a common misconception, most airmen in career fields that don't involve combat do not carry weapons while in Iraq. You deploy with an m-16 or m-9 and take it to the armory upon arrival. You don't see it again unless you are doing augmentee work (escorting third country nationals), participating in an arming exercise, going outside the wire, or you just happen to be located at an army or marine base.

tDeYQV6raa	well, first of all (and obviously) as a constitutional lawyer you will deal with interpretations of the constitution most.    many go on to work in the government.  the only constitutional lawyer i know, (you may have heard him on the radio as well, i know him personally) is Hugh Hewitt, he worked in the Nixon and Reagan administration, and now teaches constitutional law at Chapman University.    thats just one example of a career.      a big part of law is simply teaching you how to think, not necessarily how to be a lawyer, so you will benefit from it in anything you do.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Mostly you become a professor at a law school and write books.  You teach constitutional law to law students and maybe in Political Science classes.    Then you act as a consultant to the ACLU or similar organizations.  Cushy job if you can survive the politics of the ivory tower set.|`|z88IMXNFaa	You better have the best grades on earth and a boatload of money.  The firms that handle constitutional cases and the ACLU generally only hire the cream of the crop.  That means top schools, law review, graduation with honors.  If you want to teach it, plan on getting masters in law from an Ivy League school in addition to the law degree and the college degree.    If your high school career is not heading toward admission to an Ivy League school, your aspiration is unrealistic.|`|ZzknHgU1aa	Let's back up a step. Do you want to be a lawyer? On the New York Bar Exam, they test 33 areas of law. That's a heck of a range. But they all have one thing in common. To be a lawyer is to stand in the middle of someone else's arguments. That is what every lawyer does. Constitutional law is just the flavor of the argument. I'm not trying to discourage you - far from it. Some real estate stuff has Constitutional aspects (eminent domain), as does criminal law (cruel and unusual punishment), international law (trade tariffs), military law (Geneva Convention), -  gun control, states' rights, abortion, and on and on.|`|tNG1oPPqaa	I wouldn't pay too much heed to maxmom56's comment on attending an Ivy League school for your undergraduate. If you get in and want to, more power to you, but law schools--from which your career as a lawyer will actually proceed--don't really give a damn where you got your undergraduate degree as long it's an accredited institution. The two things law schools care about--with the exception of Yale, Stanford, and possibly Harvard--are your undergraduate GPA and your LSAT score.    Yale, Harvard, and Stanford, being at the top of the ladder, tend to look for additional soft factors that make you stand out from a crowd--though Harvard has a damn large class size and so doesn't require nearly as much (comparatively) as Yale.    The point being, you can go to your local State U or whatever, be awesome there, do great on the LSAT, and that'll get you into the top law schools which will be the bigger help in that career path. (That's not to say that an Ivy League undergrad won't help somewhere along the road, but it's not nearly as vital as maxmom makes it out to be.)
YupMCYHlaa	Up to the early 20th century, all drugs were legal.  You could just walk into a drugstore and buy opium, morphine, etc. In fact heroin was invented to help people recover from opium addiction.  The worst part of it is that over-the-counter medications didn't even have to put what was in them on the label. People bought 'soothing syrup' for fussy babies, and it would quiet them right down, but they never knew the key active ingredient was opium!    So it was a good idea to start passing laws against drugs, to make patent medicine companies label their medicines.    But you know how we do things, anything worth doing is worth overdoing.  Marijuana was a drug that was mostly used by blacks in the south and by Mexican immigrants, so it was labeled at first a 'narcotic', and when they couldn't make that stick they changed the name of The Department of Narcotics to The Department of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.  A man in the FBI named Harry Anslinger made a name for himself by crusading against pot.  The name 'marijuana' was chosen by the govt. and media because it sounded Mexican.  And William Randolph Hearst had just bought his own forests to make paper for all the newspapers he published and saw hemp as a competitor--hemp can grow 8 times more fiber per acre, for paper, than trees, so he crusaded against it too.    In the 1930s there were lurid movies about teenagers getting stoned on pot and going crazy, becoming violent, shooting and raping each other.  Films like Reefer Madness and Marijuana, Weed with Roots in Hell.  Today they are just funny.    We might have seen our mistake and legalized pot, but in the 1970s President Nixon declared the War on Drugs.  It wasn't really about drugs to begin with, I really think it's real purpose was to erode our constitutional rights and give police more power.  Before the War on Drugs, police couldn't knock down doors.  They couldn't stop a person on the street and question him for no good reason.  They couldn't confiscate money, cars and even real estate with no due process.  The War on Drugs made all this possible.  The War on Terror is only an extension of the War on Drugs.    Today any politician who admits our drug laws aren't working is immediately jumped on by his opposition as being 'soft on drugs', so they all compete to be 'tough on drugs'.  So nobody is going to propose legalizing marijuana any time soon.|`|nmAjAH73aa	Politics|`|GO9kFIXTaa	It's economics, that's all.  Google marijuana laws and you'll see for yourself!|`|BQQLZa7Baa	i sometimes wonder why cigarettes are legal. but i guess because they're more addictive, it would be much harder to get people to support banning cigarettes.    plus, smoking weed is pretty easy to get away with and people who do smoke it don't really care if it's legal or not.|`|bU8CnoONaa	oh my god i had the SAME exact question.  itz cuz the tobacco industry brings the government more money than weed can|`|ZUoD9wniaa	a) because the government cant make money off of it  b) because the people against it are scared to death by the false public service announcements and know nothing about it  and for the retard that says its because we dont want people getting high and driving, why is alcohol still legal? its way easier to drive when youre high, than when youre drunk anyway.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Because we don't want stoned people behind the wheels of cars.

nudUEz4Faa	The previous marriage doesn't mean nothing, you can't use it for nothing.    Now, in your marriage. How did he got in the country matters, did he see an immigration officer when he entered(good), is this the only time he entered(good), if no, did he overstayed his permanency(bad) or no(good), if he enter trough immigration, it's a easier case, if he crossed the border, he'll need a Waiver of Inadmissibility from an immigration judge, if you were approved on the I-130 on 2003, you should now get this Waiver to apply for the i-485/i-765/g-325/g-325/i-693 if he came trough immigration and was never in a deportation process, you should have filed all this forms already with the I-130. So, the answer for your question is hard to give because more details on how did he entered the country is needed, how many times and for how long, was he ever deported or has he ever being in a deportation process, did he ever went to an immigration jail, got out on bail... all this things matter. email me if you have more details, or edit your question.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Nope must leave while his   Visa is being Processed..

AA10123414	It goes to court unless both parties agree on a settlement.|`|QP7VyPV6aa	Insurance company has a duty to defend the hospital.

As to the hospital's making any kind of decision, they have their own attorneys. If somehow the hospital is involved in a situation that requires THEIR insurance company to be involved, the insurance company will represent the hospital in court.     Often, hospitals (or their insurers) will offer to settle out of court simply because it ends up being cheaper to give a patient some money than pay a whole team of high-powered, high cost attorneys to take the trial all the way through. (Often even if the patient is wrong!)
1fxHHrWIaa	There is a lot of hidden pork, like the $12 million for ACORN even though they are being investigated in 12 states. Go figure.|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	Only about 10% of the money will go to programs that will actually create jobs. It is going to drive inflation WAY up, hurting the poor and lower middle class. But since T-Notes (T-Bills with terms of 1 year or longer) should start to pay really well, I am really happy about it. During the Carter Administration five year T-Notes paid over 15% and are not subject to state taxes so this is good for anyone who has some money to invest. That was a great return and I expect that it will be like that in 2 or 3 years, people can cash in the gold and silver (that they have been buying, instead of stock, since when it became obvious Obama was going to win last summer) and buy T-Notes and be set, this is a great investment opportunity. You are lucky to be alive during this time, it is such a predictable outcome that can be capitalized on.    If you don't believe me, watch what happens to the price of precious metal bullion tomorrow. And start stocking up on things that you use regularly or a lot of, that don't go bad. Anything you buy today for $1 that cost $5 in a year or two, will be like a 500% return on investment, where are you going to get rates like that.

MSj9oLBmaa	Sadly, it means nothing to some people.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	You been a bad boy and gonna hug your mommy from the jail cell|`|YupMCYHlaa	It means roughly the same thing.  When you are arrested you are taken into government custody.  You are no longer 'free', you have to go with them and stay where they put you (usually behind bars).  When you are in this custody, you are said to be 'detained'.    Being arrested means that you are suspected of a crime.  Almost universally, the arresting officer will tell you, right then, what you are suspected of.  Formal charges must be filed within a very short time, 1 or 2 days, or else you must be releasted.      It's only recently that people have been arrested and detained without being suspected of, or charged with, a crime.  This is a violation of a very long-standing tradition in American/English law, going back to the 12th century.  People who are detained without being accused or charged of a crime are often called 'detainees' because they are simply detained, not charged.      The government, and the media, don't like to use the word 'arrested' for these people because they were not actually arrested, it's more like they were just kidnapped.|`|A7r8xX7saa	It means you have been charged with at least one crime. Detained means you are being kept pending charges.|`|dkkdt1FEaa	You get arrested when the cops read you your rights and handcuff you, then they take you to the station, fingerprint you etc. and put you in the holding cell where you are then detained|`|o40QqoQGaa	Detaining somebody means that you have reason to suspect somebody for being involved in a crime. Where as arrest, is where you have probable cause, and the person has commited a crime.     Detaining somebody means you hold them, usually when a crime is occurring, or you dont have full evidence to support the arrest.|`|vMbGRHuCaa	To be arrested really means the same as to be detained.  You are being held against your will.  It doesnt mean you'll be charged with anything.  You have just been detained|`|e0p8Ku9Waa	It means time in the jammer.|`|6lr3NL3caa	being arrested just means that you have been charged with a crime. i've been arrested a few times and just let go on my signature to promise to take care of it and go to court. i've been arrested and held in custody too which means you are in custody and are detained. so being arrested and being detained are two different things...detained means you are in police custody..

You will not necessarily get leave while in A school usually not authorized especially if you have to fly to do it.  She can come to you and maybe get married but it doesn't always work either.   While in A school you will get orders to your first base, you might not be happy with it, because you could be going overseas in which your fiance will not be allowed to go, even if she is your wife.  You could also have to report right to the ship which is on deployment.    There is no way to determine when you should get married.  If you are patient wait until you have finished school, reported to the command and found out what the schedule will be.  You will be very busy the first few months at the command doing qualifications and everything else.|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Honestly wait until after your first deployment to get married.|`|ymZlFYn1aa	When my wife was in the Navy her A-school was in Pensacola FL and I lived in JAX so we drove to meet each other on the weekends.

CZwJJetyaa	Unfortunately there are people out there who's sole purpose is to complain about everything. I have neighbors that are whining jerks that make a big fuss out of every little thing too.  As long as things are quiet by midnight there isn't a thing they can do legally but complain.   Your neighbors are just miserable and unhappy and are looking to bring people down to their level of unhappiness. Talk to your landlord and tell him/her that your neighbors are harassing you. I'm sure you child is in bed by 10 PM at night that they have no real reason to complain.  And everybody stomps, not just your child. If they have a real problem with the sound of foot steps they should be the ones to move.|`|EcuCO4LCaa	You call them unreasonable and rude? Think about what you said for christs sake.     Your child has adhd...fine that happens BUT there are meds he can be on and whether you like it or not, it is your resonsibility to control your child and make the building you are living in a decent environmet for all to live in. They are entitled to peace and quiet regardless of the fact that you have an unruley child. Start giving him his meds earlier so he gets out of bed without throwing a hissy fit. Put the meds in a drinking cup and wake him early to take a drink. I would have your @$$ in court for disturbing the peace constantly if I were them. Millions of kids have adhd yet their parents are able to control them.|`|XR03jIndaa	If it were me, id be complaining too. I have a small child and lived in an apartment where i had VERY noisy upstairs neighbors. they would wake him up at all hours. and there were times that i would be asleep as well and be woken up. You may have a difficult time but dont blame them when they get upset at all the noise your child is making. Perhaps you should look into somewhere else to live that would be more peaceful for yourselves and others. You can deal with it because its your child. even some of the supporters of your question might not be able to deal with it if they were in the neighbors position wheres theres noise all the time.|`|89239f44272f2582fcdd0bed556489b2aa	Perhaps you could switch to a ground floor apartment where the noise would be less noticeable.

I met an 10 year old boy whom i was told had adhd,add etc,, etc,, etc. well to make a long story short i have surprised his single mother and others. he had turned 13yrs old and i was at home cleaning my guns and rifles. he came running in the house i told him to stop running he came from behind me and hit me on the head with a branch. i got up and he tried to run and fell and saw my rifle in my hand and his eyes popped open , he begged sorry like he thought he was going to get executed or something. all i did was stare at him. now he is 20 yrs old and he does not need his meds when he is around me or if his mom or anyone else mentions my name. he has patience and is a well to do citizen. I wonder what happened, was e misdiagnosed and he was treated as a kid with a health problem and he took advantage of it. i had a similar expirience with another adhd victim and he too has healed. whats going on?|`|Gr99OjQuaa	i hate to say this, but very few people are truly compassionate.   i hope i had some advice to give but i really dont|`|2OBP8fqJaa	That is a really difficult situation to be in. I can understand your neighbors issue, but i can also symphathize with your situation. I would do my best to try and find another apartment that will be better suited for your situation, even ask if you can get a bottom floor apartment in your complex as soon as one becomes available then yu won't have to move far. I'm sure if you addressed it well, your landlord would be more than happy to accommodate you so your rent money keeps flowing in to him (as opposed to moving out) and your neighbors will be much less disturbed. In the meantime I would ignore the neighbors outburts at your door, since you can't do anything about it. Be glad they haven't called the police, yet, for disturbing the peace which they have a right to do. Just try to work out a better living situation ASAP. If you have to face the neighbor, you might point blank ask them if they are willing to switch apartments with you. That may shut them up for awhile.|`|ObKFA5djaa	tell the people that live below you       "you choose o live on the bottom and this is what you get"    and tell them it is not your fault

You can have a jury trial, or a trial before the judge only if you cannot reach an agreement with the prosecutor.  You can hire an attorney, or if you cannot afford one and the crime has a jail sentence as a possibility, then you can ask the court to appoint an attorney to represent you.<br>  <br>  You should at least check with an attorney to see if you can afford one and what the sentence will be in your state.<br>  <br>  In Texas theft of $50 to $500. is a class b misdemeanot, meaning up to 180 days in jail, or fine and jail, or you could be placed on probation.<br>  <br>  Under $50.00 is only a class c misdemeanor, for which you can only be fined up to $500.00, but you can get up to 180 days of deferred disposition.<br>  <br>  Having a conviction for a theft offense on your record will haunt you for the rest of your life. You will be prevented from serving on a jury, and if you are ever a witness in a case and required to testify in court it can be brought up by the other side to impeach your testimony. This would be very embarrassing if done in front of a jury. In many cases you will likely be passed over for jobs or promotions in favor of the one without the theft conviction.<br>  <br>  Theft is a "crime of moral turpitude", meaning that a conviction for theft shows the world that you have very little moral fortitude.<br>  <br>  Fight to keep this off your record, and if you need to get into counseling to prevent your doing this in the future then get into counseling.<br>  <br>  If you plead guilty, even if you only have to pay a fine, it will be on your record for the rest of your life. If there is some sort of probation (sometimes called deferred prosecution) where your case is dismissed because you complete a theft class then with your attorney's advice, you might consider it. <br>  <br>  Be sure that your case will be dismissed. In Texas we have that, we also have "deferred adjudication" probation, where you go to court and plead guilty, the judge finds there is sufficient evidence of guilt, but deferrs adjudication and places you on probation. If you complete the probation then the case is dismissed. If you are placed on probation under these circumstances the case stays on your record, but shows it was dismissed. You can go back to court to get an order of "non-disclosure" where no one can see the court file, and it gets sealed from your record, but that is expensive, and may not be granted. <br>  <br>  If you do a deferred prosecution then if the case is dismissed, at some time in the future you can go back to court and have it removed from your record under a process called "expunction", but not before the statute of limitations has passed.<br>  <br>  You could agree to plead guilty to something else, like trespassing or some other crime that is not a crime of moral trupitude, maybe, but if you plead to theft it will be on your record.<br>  <br>  And don't steal, it is wrong.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Uek2TNLMaa	petty theft.....up to 1 month and\or probation......first offence is way less time....|`|FwmUmcM9aa	IF ITS A MISDEMEANOR DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT..YOUR JUST GOING TO GET COMMUNITY SERVICE OR PROBATION

Edit: Sambo has been listening to Newt Gingrich again.  Repealing Sarbanes Oxley is a stupid idea, just as stupid as when they said that repealing the mark-to-market rule for FAS 157 would end the economic crisis.  Not only is it blatantly unethical to repeal accounting rules just to bolster balance sheets and bottom lines, but neither of these options attacks the root problem.|`|RermzbWgaa	The Democrats would not have had unanimous opposition to this from the Republicans had they done away with a few stupid provisions they had floating in it (that the Republicans know full well will NOT be ok with the American people).

Fools (fire sales of true capital with the American people for pittance).    Now the bipartisanship is with the opposition for crying out loud!  The Dem's in the House shot their own foot and have acted very foolishly (especially for the first bill out from this congress).

His deregulation and tax cuts after the dot com bust exacerbated the problem that we have now.  Even if he did have some sort of idea, with a significant democrat majority in the Senate and a large majority in the House he likely wouldn't be able to push through his own agenda.    He'd do what the Republicans are doing now: trying to save face.  They know their ideas haven't worked and aren't popular now, so they'll make a fuss to get the democrats to throw them a bone and call it a victory.  They can claim to be working with the democrats, and if the stimulus ultimately  doesn't help they'll claim that they were right all along.|`|NCSxPWQvaa	He would have cut taxes across the board for EVERYBODY, then freeze gov't spending, unlike adding 500 billion in pork barrel spending like your hero Obama.

Also, Obama doesn't need republican votes to pass it, so the only reason someone would try to get enemy to vote in favor for it is so Obama doesn't look bad down the line when the stimulus package doesn't work. If it worked and would do all that Obama claims, then he can own it and use it to destroy the republican party later.....So if this is the kind of lacking intellect to properly analyze something that effects us all, just to cover Obama from hate later, you've done nothing more than sell your soul for campaign promises.  At least with Republicans, sure, you can point to history and show where they did things dumb. Expecially now since there's no conservatives in their base because they betrayed them. But i'd rather vote for a dummy...than the corrupt, money grabbing, back stabbing politicans on the democrat side.

Another thing we could do is get rid of the market accounting rule (I think it was in this same act) which forces companies to write down their balance sheets based on the stock market. We need to lower the corporate income tax rate because the US has the 2nd highest in the world; even higher than Russia's (sad, very sad).  Then we could secure the boarder, because there is a danger that the lawlessness down there is going to spill over here and that is going to hurt us in more ways than just the economy.    edit- good riddance huh?

The sooner it falls, the sooner we can begin to heal from this economic attack from our previous "leader."      Talk of tax cuts is an attention diversion used so the masses don't look at the real issues.  Tax cuts don't stimulate the economy or make anyone rich.

Generally, if you are not in a country you cannot be prosecuted under its laws. The only exception might be in cases in which the crime you committed is also illegal in the country you are in, but effected another country and your government allows you to be tried there instead (recent case of a British hacker who gained unauthorized access to computers in the US, and the British government agreed to extradite him to the US to be tried... although he won his appeal against it, and the decision is under review).    2. In most countries slander and libel are not covered under criminal law (crimes against the state/society); they're covered under civil law, meaning they're not treated as a crime until an individual (rather than a law enforcement agency) files a lawsuit. This means you will have no co-operation from either government in the matter; you would have to travel to their country to file the suit (assuming there are slander/libel laws in that country), and even then, you need to know certain personal details about the person so they can be invited to court.    3. In the UK, you have to be 18 before you can sue, OR BE SUED (the minimum age for criminal prosecutions is 11... I think). I imagine a lot of countries have similar laws.    So in answer to your question; BECAUSE AGE AND LOCATION DO MATTER!
teKeLxX2aa	It depends what you're looking for. If you want to be trained how to kill people with a rifle, then you should consider joining the Marines or the Army. Some people enjoy shooting guns and digging fox holes.    If you want a technical job that's applicable to the civilian world when you get out, I would say your best bet would be Navy or Air Force. And that's not to say that the Army or Marines don't have jobs applicable to the real world, but there's more emphasis on technology oriented jobs in the Navy and Air Force.     It all depends on what you want to do, you should take some time browsing the branches and looking through the various jobs that each branch has to offer. If you are planning on being a police officer, you could become an MP in any of the four branches as long as you meet the requirements and don't have a record. However, you're going to be put through a lot more if you decide to go Marines, I can tell you that much.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	The problem is that the answers are totally subjective.

Yes, we can hope we never ever have a President as bad as George W. Bush, his equally poor father or even Ronald ReaGuns for Hostages, ever again!!!!!!!!  Neocon Repubes only mess things up royally, leaving the Dems. to clean up their ever increasing and more costly messes!
8Mi15cTtaa	the president has changed and the media loves him. Don't worry, it won;t be long before Barry really screws up and the media won't be able to make any more excuses for him.     I can't believe they action appointed that tax evader as Treasury Secretary. Shows how far down we've gone as a country!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Hypocrisy.   Plain and simple, delusional, liberal hypocrisy.   Let em keep it up I say.  They are only proving to the country that they are simple minded hypocrits with nasty attitudes and no class.  Makes the rest of us look really good by comparision.|`|1eb935e6100f32fd7c9a8bad9e9be568aa	Can you say.... FLIP  FLOP????    Obama is an olympic athelete in that particular sport!|`|OwQsCR4Saa	I think all of this changes daily...no matter who is running things.|`|NCSxPWQvaa	Obama is a serious fear mongerer. "We must get this through as fast as we can, or we face a serious crisis. We cannot wait." I can see the used-car salesmanship already.|`|yjDM4Mzfaa	War was never, is never and will never be good!  Helping your fellow man as opposed to fat cat rich CEOs and big corporation, i.e. neocon Republicans is also very good!|`|LhCTfw95aa	Less than a month since a new party moved into the White house
636L1P5Zaa	yes|`|eu6UQElYaa	Spending during a war isn't the same as just spending money.   You need a better understanding about that statement.     And the Keynesian model for aggregate demand does not support the idea that an increase in GOVERNMENT spending will increase economic prosperity.  It helps if you understand Keynesian economics before trying to talk about it.|`|cbef2b80ad80c5adc11d61992ee6897daa	No.|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Spending will improve economy because there is movement of money.|`|zze8XmjLaa	Hell no.|`|4woDH5Inaa	If your directing this question toward Republicans on here, you should know that they don't know what the word "aggregate" means.    They are horrible at economics, all they do is scream "tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts!!"|`|QI74CxD0aa	I think that indiscriminate spending can bring an economy down.    Targeted spending can help the economy.  But if the amount of government borrowing and spending is too high, the value of all the money in the economy goes down.|`|6tDFpxUJaa	I definitely don't agree with that.  Economic prosperity relies on a healthy economy, which relies on the spending of its people.  If we don't spend and make money within our economy then it cannot survive let alone exist.|`|UcizgK8maa	Yes, we learned that from the Great Depression. Our politicians don't know history because they always repeat the same mistakes. Keynes developed his economic theory in the great depression. Adam Smith's economic theory is better for our free enterprise system.|`|bCT0nUiVaa	Its when the public spends that drives the economy.  What you are hearing is the concern that the new govt plan is borrow and spend,... we are going mortgage our future for a quick fix right now.  This new plan will put huge interest handcuffs on our children and grand children.      If money were being put into the hands of the public, then spending will help.    Government pouring money into things like what is going to happen is NOT the answer.        May 1939, Rosevelt  Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau testified:    "We are spending more money than we have ever spent before, and it does not work. ... I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. ... I say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started ... and an enormous debt, to boot."        Reply Polar Bear:   Tax cuts put more money in the hands of the public which means there is more money for them to spend and pump into the economy....thats why tax cuts are importants.
3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Disclose your medical history. These types of recruiters are few and far between. Sorry but you got a bad one. Most recruiters are honest and forthcoming. As far as ADD goes more kids are put on ADD medication that don't need to be on it. ADD is a disqualifier. I took it as a kid and if it is over 2 years since you took it then it is not a big deal. If you were still on it then it would be a problem.
AA10224746	No, I think thats people just looking for something to complain about.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	There is nothing knew under the sun. Just think of all the great ideas you have come up & you will see that not one is really original even though you may think it is.|`|69bp1IMfaa	Yes|`|AA11041009	More like he stole it from Cesar Chavez..."Si se puede."|`|8ZN38eapaa	there is no original thought rattling around between those huge ears!!!|`|JH2GqpA2aa	In school, in class, I learned about rhetoric. It is a a form of persuasion. Aristotle had a theory of it. He claimed that three elements were needed to make persuasion successful: ethos ( developing character), lagos ( reason/argument) and pathos ( stirring emotions). If one could successfully achieve these three elements in rhetoric, another could be persuaded.|`|hTFalwX6aa	I thought it sounded familiar when I heard it.    STOLE IT...YES HE DID!~|`|cumnSTuvaa	no|`|8yAQjqRpaa	It gave me a good laugh. t But i really dont think Obama stole it|`|OlcC4hwcaa	yes he did, did we vote for him, yes we did
fQgbBx7caa	Pass these phone numbers around the news on t.v. just gave us, lets all call and ask  White House   is 1-202-456-1111  Capitol Switch Board....1-202-224-3121  Please pass it around.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	It's funny how many Republicans are coming out of the woodwork to whine about the deficit now. When we had a Republican spendthrift president you didn't say a word about his deficit funded tax cuts, stimulus packages, bailouts, and a money pit war that still rages in Iraq.
s1LfdCdsaa	If they were any more out of touch they'd be touching Pluto.|`|TAvPmMQ3aa	I can't fu*king believe that thing passed.  We're all in big a** trouble all thanks to them.  And only them.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	sure...like that $600 Bush "gave" us was a sure sign that he knew what the value of a dollar is and how the economy was going...|`|B6c7BeDnaa	they had some major blunts when they came up with this raw deal.|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	Yep.  Pretty much sums it up.  You can't even protect Obama anymore after this.  Just look at it.    A STIMULUS BILL that has CONDOMS, STD MEDICINE, money to ACORN for more Voter Fraud.  The NEW NEW Deal.  Seriously..    This can be fixed so easily with Business TAX CUTS...|`|hTFalwX6aa	EXTREMELY    It is like they are from another planet.|`|AA11103371	I dunno.  How out of touch is they?      School must be out....    How out of touch is republicans?  Not a single one of them voted for the bill and yet it still 244-188.  Reminds me of a neutered dog.  All kinds of bark but not bite.|`|VXk8EZoHaa	THEY ARE ALL ON CRACK|`|3NKOVaNhaa	WHO THE HELL KNOWS what's about to happen. Either this stimulus package will do us good. OR we will turn into a third world country.        Either way IT'LL be a ride, so buckle up and until we get their STOP whining.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Well if they tried to touch the sun, they would burn themselves because they are so close to it.|`|vKR4tysjaa	Further out of touch than the Repukes!  Scarey, huh?|`|f260fecd5ca5dc4eb4cded2d66649c61aa	Why don't you help us all out and write up a decent stimulus package that is ideal?|`|448c7a6cdc78d3a797b7c58c25d1ff56aa	Not so much Obama..he tried for Biparitsan..its that nut job Pelosi..Even the Republicans are calling it Pelosi's stimulus package..She is too far left and she doesn't get that the country is moderate|`|HELAyo8Baa	Well, the overwhelming majority of the public supports the legislation, and the Democrats are just coming off an election in which they completely routed us Republicans.    Does that sound like a party that is "out of touch"?|`|AA10224746	I think since Bush had 8 years to screw it up we should give Obama at least 6 months to see what happens.    After all the plan we have been on has not worked.|`|zrggGS2Caa	Obama has 80% approval ratings according to Gallup. It seems like maybe the other 20% are the ones out of touch...|`|8rGZFBKOaa	How out of touch are they? Well, for starters........ I'll bet none of them have any idea where the nozzle at the gas pump goes.     This could be fun.........     I'll bet none of them have any idea.............. (you take one)|`|0nZHAaQDaa	they are so out there that there are in touch with Klingons on Uranus|`|LZLQKUMPaa	they're not out of touch they're taking care of the upper people the CEO upper management and their future bidders to everybody did donated to the democratic party .they're taking care of them first the working people are last as they don't care .|`|AA11598520	Very, yes it's says plenty.|`|8ZN38eapaa	the only ones more out of touch, are the ones that voted them into    power!!!|`|Irjopfpvaa	They are so out of touch they won the election. Republicans are so in touch the people voted them out (sarcasm).    Seriously...The stimulus package is separate from lowering the tax. You seem to be confuse or you're just overcompensating for the GOP mess that will take years to correct.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	lol well they are liberals so that answers your question|`|ac815d08d535e731adb9a4dce003e9eeaa	Same as Bush Jr. and the republicans. Their $700,000,000,000 package last fall did nothing for the economy.
WCkOUF9aaa	Pelosi & Obama her boy are so far out of touch its not even funny.|`|dh1mtb6aaa	It only helps the porn industry with the $335 million for STDs.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	I doesn't,|`|E1gKL2fSaa	Pelosi said" babies are a burden on society"    This woman is soooooo looney she makes Palin look like Einstein.|`|pLeio93Paa	Read it for yourself...  Nothing. It offers tax credits to those who offer jobs... (more corporate handouts) - In fact, other than the study and the web site, this looks a awful lot like Bush's last stimulus... Minus the free checks... and minus the tax rate cut...|`|jS2s21W0aa	The stimulus package is to be used to create social programs, much like FDR's New Deal during the Great Depression. What President Obama plans to do is to create jobs working for federal agencies, including positions rebuilding American infrastructure, as well as others.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	I bet a majority of these urban Obama loyalists, wont even consider using these condoms, spend by loans, the U.S government got, from other nations.  Start saving your golden spoons everyone.  It's going to be a long ride.|`|AA10301974	This will create a huge number of construction and modernization jobs, which will keep or add thousands of construction, IT, and service jobs. That will lead to a significant number of products being bought, which will create manufacturing and more service jobs.     All of those people will have money to spend which should cause the economy to recover.     And yes it will work. Although we are still going down hill, things are starting to turn around. Several companies in my area are planning new facilities and hiring of thousands of people over the next year.     All of the closing stores will lead to bigger market shares for existing stores which will soon start hiring to fill the increased demand.    By the way, the porn industry has been hurt worse than most industries.

And it still passed by more then 50 votes.  All republicans can do is yelp.  That's it.  A schnauzer has more power then the entire republican party.  Pathetic.|`|VXk8EZoHaa	I DID BECAUSE I WAS OFFERED MEXICAN-BE-GONE SPRAY IF I DID|`|wQ5LKysaaa	Not a one, I hear.    And yes, Republican does NOT equal Conservative!|`|fDuCamMraa	None, zilch, zero. And there were eleven Democrats with a backbone and integrity too!|`|g5FbtzNTaa	No Republican in Congress voted on this sack of pig fat. There's no guarantee it will be that way after it leaves the Senate though. There is still a slight chance for some turn coats to emerge.    Fellow Republicans should however call their Congressman/woman and thank them for keeping it off our backs.|`|3NKOVaNhaa	..................0        I do give them that, they stood up for what they believe in. So to me it seems that the Republicans know WHAT they stand for and therefore they are united, unlike the democrats.|`|Ql8F1Jj2aa	What a great day!  When this stimulus fails, and it will... Republicans  won't have to take the fall. I called my congress persons yesterday and told them if they gave in to this there would be dire circumstances in 2010.|`|70DZWz2Baa	None did because even the liberal republicans are thick-headed enough to fall for it. us conservatives are in exile but as with all exiles we come back and claim our rightful place.|`|AA12109395	Noone|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY REPUBLICAN voted for that crap.  nobody to blame but the democrats on this one.
587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Because they're so very transparently wrong.  - He literally taught you can strengthen an economy by removing resources from it and by discouraging economic action.  - Keynesians are the perpetually surprised "experts" you always hear cited in economic news stories. Everything that ever happens always surprises them. Really. Literally every development comes as a surprise to a Keynesian. When an economic act is REPEATED they are honest-to-God SHOCKED when it yields the same result it always had before. It surprises them every time, over and over again.  - Democrats are guided by Keynesian ideas. This is why they take "it always worked that way before" as proof it will be different this time.|`|AA11312653	Because he so articulately pointed out the foolishness of expecting that business would somehow police itself.     Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Its just recycled Karl Marx.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Why do conservatives have such a disdain for the ideas of John Maynard Keynes?"    Because Keynes was wrong.|`|fDuCamMraa	How about if I just come over to your house, take all your money and make you give me your debit card and the codes and take you life savings of $12.50. Would you like that? If not, then you know what I don't like about people like Keynes, Marx and all the rest of the socialist pigs.|`|mcehFtY0aa	While Repubs love the idea of dropping the interest rate to hekp the economy, the system also calls for funding public programs with an eye to zero unemployment. Reps don't care if you have a job. If a business is in trouble. lay off 75,000 employees   The problem with the interest rate thing is, ponce the rate is down to 1/2 or 1% there is no where else to go and the economy is in the toilet..like now  Obama is planning the massive employment effort. Jobs are  1, not big business|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Anything that reflects the actions of those who support uncontrolled capitalism will be looked down upon by Conservatives.     Most couldn't care less what happens to the every day person. As long as they get their money, everyone else can literally die as far as they are concerned.|`|eef76b61eca737b62766034d9204c8baaa	You are weak.  Not strong at all.    Gay gay gay    Maynard|`|Uyup7lBDaa	Because taxes are evil ?     Seriously..Bush's tax cuts with his surplus from the Clinton admin and the results that have manifested in this recession (which is technically a depression since its supposed to have started in 2007, a recession is limited to 365 days.)|`|pLeio93Paa	I don't know about conservatives... But I think his ideas are a little outdated. Macroeconomics had a time and a place... But it stifles free markets, and takes peoples' destinies out of their own hands...|`|zze8XmjLaa	Because they worship at the monetary altar of Milton Friedman. Fundamentally, any individual or government that spends too much and borrows too much, will eventually fail. Keynesian or Friedman, the fundamental lesson remains the same. Too much spending and debt is too risky, bound to collapse at some point.n
fSlZQzS4aa	If you had an open container in the car, he could arrest you.  If you had one beer and hit the road, you should be OK unless one beer puts you under the table.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	not likely, but depends on the strength of the beer how long ago you drank it, your body height, weight etc. So many factors that its hard to say. But one beer is my limit when im driving|`|3QK8Kbzkaa	if ur under 21. and if you fail the test. i think wont though. because ur blood wouldnt be over the limit|`|PzbRJrTKaa	if your underage, and if a cop pulls you over for something, and he can smell the beer on your breath yeahh, but i don't think so unless you are drunk'.!    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|A6q6Ravhaa	out  having  one  drink  is ok  drinking  while  actually  driving  is  against  the  law|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Certainly not!|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Yes, if the Officer believes you are to impaired to drive they may arrest you.  If you had drank one beer then probably not but the fact you had drank something would raise his/her suspicion and open the door for them to investigate a possible DWI.|`|aOxwt667aa	yes|`|2BEMSGPdaa	If yu are old enough you would pass his test and could not be arrested.|`|L6w8YmoOaa	Most states have a ZERO Tolerance policy, so yea, if he suspects that you have and u take a Breathalyzer he's got you, course you can always refuse a Breathalyzer|`|k6hicodfaa	Yes, depending on your BAC.|`|429093af889ade4be8f7e7ce8b917485aa	IT all depends on your blood-alcohol level, and the specifics in your place's law.  A big beefy man may not be affected as much as a petite young lady.  It also may depend on your driving too, if it looks like you are affected (can't stay within your lane, can't go the proper speed, can't slow down properly or stop or go when you're supposed to, or weaving) or if you panic, then its more likely you'll be stopped and checked in the first place.    In Ontario, and other places in Canada, the legal drinking age starts at 19,   don't have to wait until 21.  Its cool to be Canadian! eh! :)|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	um depends on your body size (bigger no, smaller yes) and how much food youve eaten (lots no, not-so-much, yes). and your breathalyzer test must be under .08% (.02% in most states for drivers under 21)..|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	In my state If you had an open beer can in the car you could be arrested for "transporting an open container" or a variation drinking while driving.|`|AA11560958	If you're underage, yes.|`|lfK1KKbeaa	depends on your body size. if your small then maybe. if your big then probably not.|`|zze8XmjLaa	Absolutely! You can get a got beat-down, too.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	No...as long as you are over 21. You have to be over a certain blood-alcohol limit before you can be arrested, and one beer would not be enough for that...unless maybe you were really small, like a midget or something...or it was a 40 oz beer, lol.|`|UtyO8wiQaa	uhm if your underage and if u get wasted really fast|`|wztEAVm2aa	probs not!!|`|aXSjRwEVaa	It depends on your blood alcohol level, which depends on your tolerance.|`|AA10524071	Doesn't matter as long as you are driving impaired. Any amount will get you arrested.|`|P9inKWOaaa	depends on your bodys ability to metabolise boose. everybodys limit is different. getting caught drinking and driving will get you booked tho.|`|RWAHgk3Aaa	depends on where you are in the world, some laws prohibit any form of drinking where say my country, your allowed one standard drink every hour (4 max)...and yes, depends how old you are too :) I would do a google search for drinking laws in your area :)|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	are you underage? if so then yes he could have  are you underweight? if so then yes he could have (depends on how much alcohol was in your blood, this amount is different for every person)    Be safe never drink & drive good luck!!!|`|Hj7fcbjzaa	It's not how many drinks you have, but what your blood alcohol level is.  In the United States and Canada, you're allowed with a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or less.    If you weigh 90 lbs or more, this would generally allow you to have one drink and drive, although there are other influencing factors (such as how much you've eaten that day, and how often you drink).    Wikipedia has some good charts that can help you determine this further.|`|VX16L24Taa	Your intoxication level must be over .8 for him to arrest you. As a DUI driving under the influence of an uncontrollable substance in you case being alcohol.     Once beer wont do it, but everyones different, what do you feel like when you've had one beer?    The officer could pull you over for reckless driving, if he pulls you over and you tell him you've had one beer. Depending on how you were driving, or how the officer felt that day. It would be hard to over right in court, once youve admitted to drinking. Now a days they are very hard on drinking and driving of any amount. Plus I dont know you age Im assuming your of age, either 19 in Canada, or 21 in America.     Please, Please, if you going to drink dont get in a car, behind the wheel to be exact!|`|jpqSnCpuaa	If you are over 21 then probably not.  The odds of one beer putting you over the limit of .08% are slim to none.  You would have to be very thin and small for that to happen. The odds are even less because you were eating when you drank, which helps your body process the alcohol faster.|`|HHICEewjaa	If the police officer believes you are too intoxicated to drive (he or she will make that decision) then yes.  Otherwise, if you are over the legal limit (usually .08 BAC) or underage, or in possession of an open container, those would be arrestable offenses.|`|XwacWyy6aa	I don't know where you live, but in England a pint is fine.  If you were driving erratically, then you would be arrested but on one pint they wouldn't do you for drunk driving, just for dangerous driving.|`|ANU22Xfnaa	depends if you were over the limit and if youre driving like a retarded policeman|`|d4LDU009aa	DON'T DO THAT AGAIN!!!!!!!|`|AA12274077	Yes. Once you have one your under the influence. My dad goes to classes...|`|ordIkLXCaa	dun drink n drive, the drink will spill haha!|`|AA10830706	yes there are many factors that are concerned|`|ua4l7Iqyaa	If you failed the breathalizer then yes you would but i doubt one beer would put you over the limit. On the other hand if one beer makes you feel intoxicated and the police officer has reason to believe you are intoxicated then he could give you a field sobriety test to determine of you are capable of operating a vehicle if you fail your arrested. so to make a long answer shorter it is possible to get arrested for drinking one beer|`|mduRdBDpaa	you can if your BAC is over .08, and show other signs of intoxication.|`|6hQVrrH3aa	Well, here is a rough estimate calculation:  130lbs  1 hour lapse since consumption (estimated)  1 x 12oz beer (average abv. 6.5%)    Your estimated BAC would be about .037 or lower, which is lower than the going rate of .080, which goes for almost all states that I have found so far.

Only about 10% of the money will go to programs that will actually create jobs. It is going to drive inflation WAY up, hurting the poor and lower middle class. But since T-Notes (T-Bills with terms of 1 year or longer) should start to pay really well, I am really happy about it. During the Carter Administration five year T-Notes paid over 15% and are not subject to state taxes so this is good for anyone who has some money to invest. That was a great return and I expect that it will be like that in 2 or 3 years, people can cash in the gold and silver (that they have been buying, instead of stock, since when it became obvious Obama was going to win last summer) and buy T-Notes and be set, this is a great investment opportunity. You are lucky to be alive during this time, it is such a predictable outcome that can be capitalized on.    If you don't believe me, watch what happens to the price of precious metal bullion tomorrow. And start stocking up on things that you use regularly or a lot of, that don't go bad. Anything you buy today for $1 that cost $5 in a year or two, will be like a 500% return on investment, where are you going to get rates like that.

But then since he WANTS to be martered, maybe it was better they didn't kill him.    Besides that it cuts down on co2 emissions, so waterboarding is environmental friendly. We should be able to sell the world on it just from the standpoint.  "Save a life and save the world!" I like it!|`|fqLo4HvKaa	Waterborading renders criminal prosecution impossible; produces unreliable information; and lowers the US government to the same level as those with no respect for human life or freedom living people.    There was no upside for America by waterboarding, but there was a hugh downside. For over 200 years, American made a better-then-fair attempt to lead by example and demonstrate its commitment to human dignity and individual freedom. All of that effort was erased by Bush administration policies that portrayed the US (accurately) as pathologically self-serving and hypocritical.    And, let me get this right, if you had to merely spend an evening in the same room as a gay man, you give up your nation and comrades even if it meant lying and making things up?|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Wow, not knowing what you're talking about is obviously a strong suit.

Confessions gained by means of torture are inadmissible.

Thinking about their terrorist tactics, waterboarding is kids play.|`|8rGZFBKOaa	I am astounded that some Americans talk about waterboarding as if it were the absolute most horrible thing ever. Considering that on Arab television, terrorists cut off a US soldier's head while he was alive. That's THEIR form of torture. Wanna tell me now how bad waterboarding is???!!!|`|vKR4tysjaa	Libs are soooo funny.  "Torture never gets you a real answer." and "What if they waterboarded Americans?" or "Waterboarding creates more terrorists."    ROFL...    1.) If torture doesn't work, then why has it been done for thousands of years, really?  If you believe this, you've never been tortured.  Everyone has a limit, sooner or later they will break you, if done right.  Doesn't make it right, but it can be successful.  It HAS been successful.    2.) I'd much rather terrorists waterboard Americans, or any of their enemies.  it beats the hell out of them beheading, or strapping on explosives and simply blowing up Americans, or anyone else that doesn't "agree with them."    3.) ROFLMAO.  If someone wants you dead, simply because YOU are an INFIDEL...ohh, never mind, you're just too close minded to get it anyway.    ALL these things are terrible, none of them are right, but do you honestly think you can talk some sense into someone who's willing to strap explosives on themselves, their children or their wives for an opportunitty to blow up people that aren't into their religion?    Which is better?  huging them and getting blown up?  Or simply exterminating the few extremists that believe that way?  Tough one, really...|`|3vjgBDu4aa	I would like to see you water boarded and also knit booties.

My money says he would have chose water-boarding. So I'm ok with it.|`|rttm1SLaaa	No, I don't care if he was waterboarded, I care whether anyone was.  The moment we make waterboarding OK, other countries will think it's OK for them too.  Our mantra is that if it protects our national security, it's not illegal.  Well what happens if someone elses national security is threatened by us?  Is it OK for them?  If not, why are we so special?  And if so, are you OK with our soldiers being waterboarded?|`|f9oAVdH5aa	Actually,he should be shot in the eye sockets.

He's also one of the few people in Washington who has managed to stay away from any type of scandal.  That's why you don't see him in the media very much!    Next would be Michael Steele.  He is very popular among many Republicans and Democrats.  He is African-American and the polar opposite of Barack Obama.  If you watched the RNC, you will know that he is a VERY strong, compelling speaker, extremely intelligent.  It would be great to see him debate with Barack Obama.  He is also one of the few Republicans who supports affirmative action.  And, of course, he is an old time Republican much like Dr. Martin Luther King who believes in equality for ALL people, and of course he wants to give opportunities to his own people.  He is interested in educating them and actually helping them, rather than keeping them stuck down in welfare and poverty.  I think black people would really feel empowered by his administration if he were to be President one day.       My last pick would be Bobby Jindal.  He has done quite a bit of good for Louisiana as their governor.  He is well informed on economics, fiscally responsible.  He knows people, and doesn't just focus on one class as many other politicians do.  Like Obama, he is a relative newcomer to politics.  He's young, and he sort of just came out of nowhere.  But he has proven himself to be a worthy politician.  One of the youngest governors this country has ever seen.  I think his sharp wit and intellect would also give Obama a run for his money at the debates.    Honorary mention:  Newt Gingrich.  This man did a lot to help the good economy we enjoyed during the Clinton administration.  He has many critics, but he is an extremely intelligent man and well spoken.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Jindal.

She will be one of the few people who survived the depression because she knows how to hunt and fish, and preserves foods.   All of her critics will have starved because they did not learn the basic rules of survival in a harsh world.   Romney maybe, he has money to survive.  He is very wealthy and very intelligent, graduated Summa *** Laude.  I can't think of a third rep. who could beat either Romney or Palin.

Equal rights ya know. However, the fact that a person is male, female, black, white, etc. should have absolutely no bearing on our decision when we vote for our leaders. Personality is important as our leaders must be persuasive but it seems to me that we have completely forgotten that we are also supposed to study the content of their character. I believe that character is the most important but the least noticed. Things like honesty, integrity, loyalty, humility, trustworthiness, duty, responsibility, and sincerity seem to be unimportant these days... And if the trend continues it will be our downfall.|`|EhvulfKraa	Yep, Sara Palin|`|Own0dhr0aa	what does a women being president have to do with obama?
Z8UV6S3baa	So, the correct answer is actually e. None of the above.     Ricardo argued that wages would increase when there was increased investment which increased the demand for labor at a rate faster than the labor supply could increase. However, when the demand was steady state then the supply would drop until it reached a subsistance level were supply was equal to demand at the lowest possible price.    So, if the demand increased gradually at a rate slightly higher than the population then option C would be true.    If the only time that demand outstripped supply then A would be true.    If the demand continued to decrease (i.e. replaced by robots or something) than D would be true.    The only one that is never true is B.    Thinkingblade|`|l2ma3RYraa	Wages will increase or decrease depending upon the profitability of the company. The other factor that is taken  into account is the viability of the company and it's ability to stay profitable. Regardless of a bust or boom cycle it will depend upon the companies profit levels and their ability to stay profitable.
wz9szz3Gaa	I know people who have homes and pay their mortgage responsibly and yes they are tired of these freeloaders because I hear it at work. I have seen some blacks fighting among themselves over this same issue. Like in all cultures you have those who request handouts and feel it's their God given right and then there are those who know what hard work is. This is the problem they should speak out more often so that maybe future generations do not follow in the freeloaders path.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Yes. Responsible peopel of all races are angry. We are becoming enraged at the fact that what we work to earn is being stolen by the government to give to lazy bums.

dOwjS7MLaa	People are scared of what they don't know. People don't know the slightest thing about Islam. They don't know what muslims believe in and what we do. We are against violence in every way imaginable.    First off you cannot simply label all terrorist muslim! If you knew anything at all about islam you would know that islam promotes peace not violence. Saying all terrorists are muslim is like saying all white people are pro slavery. (using an example. Its the only thing I can think of.) You cannot label someone something that they are not! Our religion is nowhere near cruel, and if you knew anything about it you would know that! A couple of our seven major sins are murder and sucide. So you tell me is it violent?     You dont have any evidence that muslims were the ones who did that to the world trade centers. All you have is ignorance, what other people tell you, and ignorance. If you looked anything up about my religion you would see how amazingly great it is! I was born muslim and I cant believe how lucky I was to be born into this religion I wouldnt change it for the world and if you spent one hour talking to a muslim and actual muslim who practices their religion you would see how so uncorrupt the religion actually is. Thank you for bashing it with your ignorance! That is exactly what the world needs (I am being sarcastic just so you know)  So thank you Nick H and the rest of you who have bashed this great religion. You are the type of ignorant people that the world could use way less of.    I do NOT lie about my beliefs or about who i am.|`|T7SSrLC9aa	I agree with you. There have been thousands (hundreds of thousands!) of accounts off all different types of relgions commiting acts of mass murder and other horrifying things. Muslims have become more targeted since 9/11 through the media (i.e. television) where the stupid majority just sit and watch, taking in and believing every little thing the man in the box tells them. Nobody these days ever dares to open up a book or maybe go to a museum, place of history to see just how all religions have, or do have, a part (even if it be a small fragment) EXTREME. Plus, nobody ever dares to question WHY Muslims are commiting these crimes, do not forget people, Muslims are human beings just like very average Joe in the street. There has go to be some injustice or factor out there that is causing people to commit terrible acts of terrorism. People seem to forget that there is two sides to every story, or that one person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. And i am definately NOT trying to justify horrible, cruel acts such as 9/11 (those people should be executed!) but all i am trying to point out is we all seem to have created this ideaology of a good vs evil situation. We (the atheists, maybe Christians or other religions deemed "tame" by today's standards) fight valiantley a brave battle over the "evil" Muslim, terrorists. Well its all wrong, and this issue has been turned on its head. Badly.   I know people who will read this will think i am sticking up for evil people who have commited acts of terrorism and yes - happen to be Muslim, but i am not! All i ask is for you to open your eyes and think outside the box, dont just believe what the box inside your living room tells you - try and come up with your own conclusions before starting to hate an entire race of people. I have met Muslims, as i have Christians and Sikhs and Hindu's and Atheists and i can safely tell you Muslims are no different to any other race or religion. Its just that since the modern world has been tainted with the blood of the victims of terrorism caused by a few radical, extreme and very very deluded Muslims we have all gone crazy and sterotyped an entire religion into being these evil, weapon carrying, plotting sadists.   And if you still dont believe me think of this, if you are Catholic right now think of the predominately Catholic IRA (Internation Republic of Ireland) responsible for the killings of hundreds of lives of innocent people in Ireland. If you are Christian i urge you to google up the Crusade, then see how many people your religion murdered. If you are any other religion or even not so! look up and see what people like you or your religion have ever done to the world that is harmful and bad. This isnt a bash on your specified religion or race, but just that once in a while every religion experiences radicals, extremists, hell bent on getting there point across by any means necessary.   We are all people at the end of the day, so why do we hate one another?|`|WYPEG8l7aa	So your comparing what Christians did more than a thousand years ago to what Muslims are doing now?    I dunno if this occurred to you but Christianity has evolved from a thousand years ago and were not really into the whole slaughtering in the name of God anymore.|`|6v1LIdcaaa	Fear and hate of the unknown.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Most of today`s terrorists are Muslims. And what`s worse, it is a cruel religion.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Your analogy to the Christian Crusades is fallacious.  Anyone who pays attention can tell the difference between the Christian Crusade and the Islamic Jihad - the Crusades actually ended at one point.  Muslims still haven't given up their stone-age mentality when it comes to social values and how to relate to non-Muslims, it is either convert or die.  And while not all Muslims subscribe to this philosophy personally, none of them openly oppose it, the way American whites openly have opposed and marginalized white-power groups in the US.    Bottom line, there is an anti-Muslim bias because the Muslim community earned it.  If they want the perception of their people to change, it is up to them to stand up to the radical elements of their own people - it isn't up to the rest of the civilized world to tolerate it.    Edit: Mr. History Buff, nothing you said contradicted anything that I did.  I, and may other here, are still correct in our position that Christians have since become CIVILIZED and MODERATE while the Islamic world has NOT.  Better luck next time.|`|mdHqr17kaa	Maybe because many of them, like Marxists, lie about themselves and their beliefs, ESPECIALLY when proselytizing or issuing apologetics.|`|TEsq9K54aa	9/11, suicide bombers targeting civilians only and all those videos of unwashed muslims decapitating people tend to make us a tad wary.    Maybe when I've seen a few videos of Christians behaving like the lawless, bloodthirsty muslim decapitators I'll become a little more open minded.    I do hope that muslims, such as yourself, understand the power of sarcasm!  .|`|B4kp487Caa	How many Lutherans do you see flying planes into buildings.

There are crazies in every religion, not just Islam.|`|1fxHHrWIaa	While all Muslims are not terrorists, the overwhelming majority of terrorists are Muslims. A great many of the world's Muslims also fail to denounce the violence of the few and that doesn't fare well for their image.

The Fed is printing money and spreading it around and that is a concern, but considering the alternative...    ...I have been more concerned about the TARP funds, distributed initially as they were without sufficient oversight-in my opinion-and now it seems as if both conservatives and liberals are getting a chance to offer ideas and concerns.  I think if the money is allocated in such a way as to provide short, medium and long term stimulus to the economy it may ease the pain somewhat-or at least spread it out over a longer period of time.  And it seems like they're getting down to specifics pretty good-although somebody interviewed on NPR said anything that looks like a 'punch line' needs to be taken out of the spending package.  Haw.    But you know, we're SO far gone after the last 28 years it might not make any difference what the Feds do, we're all in hock up to our eyebrows.  Maybe Ron Paul is right, that we just ought to let it happen and pick up the pieces-but then a majority of Americans didn't exactly vote for him, either.|`|DXXpHKupaa	Whether or not we need one does not matter.  It simply won't happen.    My fellow Americans are too shallow to understand what's going on and as long as they have their Ipod and Iphone and can watch American Idol, they really don't care.  True, they may vent on the internet their frustrations, but most people are cowardly in real life and hesitate to give their true opinions.    Incidentally, the Boston Tea party is a funny occurrence.  You see, the Tea Tax had nothing to do with the working class of the Colonists, they couldn't afford tea in the first place.

Other spending measures in the bill earmark over $330 million to programs that educate teens about STDs and sending $600 million over to NASA to study climate change.

I agree with you to a certain point, but not beyond that.  I agree that everyone should pay equal taxes, a flat tax % rate would be fine by me and totally fair.    What I don't agree with is that it sounds as though you think the upper class is already giving the lower class a break by employing them at all.    That's just simply not true.  The upper class need people to work for them, in fact the lower class is doing them a favor by starting at the bottom.  And if you did your research you'd find out that many of those who are successful and now upper class did start at the bottom and that is why they are so successful, because they know what it takes to get ahead.    However, not everyone can be a boss, so not everyone, even if they are hard working, will make it to the top.  And not everyone wants to be the boss.  My parents are very stable, about 15 years ago my dad was offered a higher paying position, but it would have required him to spend more time away from us (his family) so he turned it down.  He was content with where he was in his life and family time was more important.  Now, when we all left the house and it was just him and my mom he did take that job because my mom had her own job to be at too and no kids to take to sports or friends houses.      My sister is a very hard worker.  She is in her 3rd year of college and will finish her degree in 4 years (something many don't do these days.)  Not only does she go to school full time, but she works 32 hours a week (she doesn't have to, but she saves money and wants to not have to worry about money for that "just in case" scenerio.)  Anyway, she started as a dishwasher and has moved her way up with the same company to virtually every position they have (except for running the restaurant.)  In fact when she went to register for school last summer they offered her $70,000 a year if she drops out of college and takes over one of their restaurants.  She said no, she likes working there but wants her degree, and they like her so much they they have kept her on and even gave her a pay raise and work around her school schedule.      Anyway, my point is being upper class is only money, has nothing to do with being better than anyone else.  And your post sounds as if you are saying you are better than everyone else.    Let me tell you something, your parents may be upper class, but you are not.  You are not your parents.  You will have to work your way up and there will be those who came from lower class who got 4.0's and learned about hard work, and they WILL be picked over you, not because their parents are lower class, but because they were a better and harder worker than you.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	a free education? everyone pays taxes so the dept of education (government) can be in charge of the schools. so a basic education (k-12) is not free.    name one univeristy that offers a free education.

Are they paying $700 dollars a month for basic phone service?  Is your electric bill $2500 dollars a month?  Is a car for you to drive to school $8 million dollars?  Was their house $240 million dollars?  Does it cost $6,000 dollars for a doctor or dentist checkup?    If the government made prices proportional to income, life would be fair.  It is not fair.

Yes There Are  scholorshiops out there  but there are never enough to go around|`|ffHcbUeLaa	To help the poor become rich, just like you.  I am "middle class" with college GPA of 3.9 but for so many things in life you have to have money to make more money.  Some of your tax money can help fund education for poorer people (there is no such thing as free college education in the US - you get loans, if you are lucky, you earn scholarships), but intelligent people are not only born to the rich, but also to the poor, and they can get ahead in life with a little help.  Also, if someone is poor and barely has ends meet, there is no way to tax them more while the richer people will not feel as much crunch as going hungry.    I believe, however, that some of the poor people abuse the system, get a dozen kids, stay on welfare for too long and prefer the easy life - and I also do not believe this system was designed this way.  It was supposed to help for a while when you are down, but not permanently.  Therefore, we need education to change the mentality of entitlement that some people grew up with because although I am not upper class, I hate my tax dollars going to people that do not look for work and just have a free life with me and other Americans paying for it.|`|KfxTNNP5aa	Broken Veteran:  Is it my fault that you can't provide for your family? Should I have more of my money taken away because you cannot or choose not to take care of your family.  I don't mind helping but at some point one has to say enough is enough.     I have two kids of my own and there was a point when my wife lost her job and the family was covered under her insurance policy. We lost our insurance policy and because the year before we "made too much money" we were not allowed any, none, zilch, nada government assistance. It was at that point that I realized that government run social programs were broken. I had to pay nearly $600 a month for family health insurance and it was very hard as at the time that was about 1/3 or our monthly income but you know what... We did it without a single dime from the government.      The same thing will happen with Universal healthcare. Those of us who make a comfortable living will be denied benefits so that those of you who don't can take all the benefits. We will be expected to pay for your insurance through taxes and our insurance through our own means.    My father worked two and sometimes three jobs while I was growing up so we could have insurance, clothes, food etc. My mom and dad had four children and not one time in my life did we ever get a handout from the government. But her we stand at the precipice of socialism...   They all have their hands out... waiting on the government to bail them out.    I am sorry for your situation as it is unfortunate. If i knew you I would gladly give you the shirt off my back. I would help you anyway I can but that would be a personal choice of my own. Not a choice forced by the hand of government.    This sounds cold and heartless but there are organizations that will help put disabled and wounded veterans to work. We have one in the area in which i live and it is a city of about 60,000. They help find employers who are willing and happy to put people like yourself to work. Now it may not be a glamorous job but it will be a job and that is a good thing.

A big chunk of the federal debt is funded by borrowing from the Social Security trust fund, which continues to run a huge surplus.  This is good for Social Security, which gets a steady return from the Treasury, and is good for the rest of the federal budget also.      The rest of the debt is purchased by people and institutions around the world who are looking for a safe if low return place to park their money.  The advantage that the US has now is that we can borrow more cheaply than ever because everyone around the world is afraid of every other kind of investment.  This is why it has suddenly become possible to talk about trillions of dollars of additional debt, because it is not going to add a lot to the US government's interest payments.|`|KbRIqrmhaa	When the Federal Reserve Bank gets approval to bailout the banks, what they do, which is how the govt gets their money, is print our money and then loan it to us.

This nonpartisan legislation (HR 25/S 1025) abolishes all federal personal, gift, estate, capital gains, alternative minimum, Social Security, Medicare, self-employment, and corporate taxes and replaces them with one simple, visible, federal retail sales tax  collected by existing state sales tax authorities. The FairTax taxes us only on what we choose to spend, not on what we earn. It does not raise any more or less revenue; it is designed to be revenue neutral. The FairTax is a fair, efficient, transparent, and intelligent solution to the frustration and inequity of our current tax system. More details can be found at http://www.fairtax.org      The income tax equation is  income- taxes-compliance dollars = spending    The Fair Tax equation is   income = spending + taxes+ compliance dollars,  so here we are taxed as we spend and keep the compliance costs  http://wethepeople.org/wpblog/?tag=the-f...|`|ycNt74yyaa	ending overseas imperialism, meddling, conquest.

BS! i pray for the loss of all the broken families from 911 to each and every father,son, husband and so on lost at the hands of this daddies boy "w". without this bs war we are simply not where we are today economically. i guarentee not 1 person would agree with this war today knowing what the cost would be 7 years down  the road. so on that note, if 1 person has the balls to initiate such a selfish, spur of the moment, and costly decision, we should not forgive him or make excuses foro him. you cant execute a man you think killed another man, until he goes to trial. these "wmd" never saw their day in "trial" cuz they didnt exist. obama has the worst job anyone can imagine, and on top of that hes expected to meet everyones expectations? he knowingly took on the dirtiest of jobs and did it against all odds, the only thing that will save this country from this all around disaster is someone fresh surrounded by a knowledgable nonbias cabinet. contray to what anyone says he is already mor bipartison than bush ever was. blah blah i give up. you are going to think what you think i cant change that. besides ive noticed these "obama" directed questions are getting a 75%+ conservative response. bring it on<br>  ---------------------------<br>  i thank you for your compliment "rare2findd", considering my spelling and grammer is not reflected by your opinion. to be honest, i am simply a 30 yr old white man. i voted in every election since 18. i was devastated when "w" won the first election, i was very suspicious, by his reelection i was damn near convinced we were always going to be a 1 party nation with strong conservative views being the only priority on the agenda. i was torn between hillary and obama at first but really just wanted the best opponent against mccain and the gop machine. i knew theyd eat up hillary and all her history to be siffed through, but i thought theyd attack obama on his "inexperience". i have to say, the day mccain picked palin i thought christmas came early. the old man lost his attack of inexperience. infact he sealed the fate of the election. honestly i still feared an "october surprise" of some sort, and october came and went. election night was here and i watched history be made. but to me more importantly i personally saw americas only hope here at home and the world abroad. i think it may take another generation before the vast majority truly see how close we as a nation were to a calapse. it scared me to death. i swear i was so scared i announced to all my friends and family i was moving to canada if mccain won "reelection" for "w". it wouldnt have been easy but being from michigan originally i know canada is pretty harmless, and not to mention the "universal healthcare" system is better than what i can provide myself. <br>  for the record, ive worked since 17, graduated with a full time job, i opened my own ebay store in west michigan from a "spare bedroom" experiament, ive been an electrician for 8 years now and 2 weeks ago got laid off. i am using any saved money to get my az electrical license and the process takes $2000 and time. i am not lazy! it pisses me off for these conservative pricks to assume over and over again that because i supported obama, or stand by his plan (especially in contrast to the wall strret bail out) that i am lazy and cant provide for myself. i thank god i dont have a mortgage, im not married, and i have no kids. attleast i can get my $240 /wk from the state for once in my life and work under the table when a side job comes along to get my electrical license. if i were in any other predicament my goals would be completely shot and id be homeless. no pity please, just understand that none of us would have the opportunity we have or had in business if the government didnt create some opportunities. you cant expect to get leave the middle to lower class behind, pad your upper class pockets and have a dollar of any value left to spend period. we all need eachother, and to have that yacht in the bahamas you might have to pay a little more in taxes for the first time in 8 yrs. look at me, like anyone on here is in the top 5% tier in income. who are you all kidding. we all need less taxes right now, and we all need this war to end (like 7 years ago)!<br>  ---<br>  last thing, wtf is with the racism?

I especially liked the one where he got rid of Biden's crazy gun laws. Even if it did make my pre-ban AR15 and AK47's worth less, I'm glad Bush overturned those unconstitutional gun laws.<br>  BTW-if obama does try to ban guns in the US, that means he is planning something 100 times worse than Bush ever did. Something bad enough that he would fear the people rising up against him.|`|hjuIGuMbaa	OKAY THIS MAY NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY, BUT RATHER DIRECTLY SHUT UP CONSERVATIVE IDIOTS THAT ARE STILL STUCK IN "W"ONDERLAND!<br>  <br>  any of you idiots dont like the stimulus package directed towards 95% of u.s. citizens, you should refuse the tax breaks and incentives. attleast this incentive/stimulus package has an over sight commitee and primarily benefits hard hit families not the idiots on wall street as your papa bushs' did. 66% approval rating, considering what he inherited as a terrible debt and position due to stupid conservative policies of the past 8 years, his 45 days in office is refreshing to 95% of us that will see a tax break or new job, not the 2% of us (which i assume you haters are) that benefitted through bush and the GOP's proven failed policies. hate ignorant ill informed idiots! you dont like obama turn the damn channel! fuq! turn off the tv and do something about it! otherwise, shut the hell up! next election vote! dont lie and say you did, i think alot of these idiots on here are stupid, but not motivated enough of idiots to express their stupidity and actually stand in line on election day to vote for 8 more years of the same failed bs that put this country where it is today. IDIOTS!<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  whats the different of a stimulus package directed towards 95% of us, not wall strrets crooks? and a war that costs us more over 7 years and still is costing us? attleast obama didnt kill 1 innocent u.s. soldier in a fantasy hunt for wmd that dont exist? whats your price on a life? its so easy to say "im dwelling on the past" id say yesturday was the past so we all should just shut up! or maybe we need to learn from our mistakes in the past and realize where we went wrong especially if we are still paying for those mistakes today! there is not any single action in our history that has ever cost our country as much as bushs' manipulated, arrogant "ill-informed" attack on iraq against the free will of the majority of our allies. i hated the idea of the war in iraq from the start, didnt object tp afghanastan where our inteligence said obama most likely was. but the war in iraq was and still is too suspicious, almost a detour from most certainly finding a man supposively resonsible for our nations worst terrorist attack and giving him a 7 year head start to running. i guess when your family is refereed to as " brothers" by the white house at the time maybe you will get special treatment, like escorting out of our country day of attack for your immediate family. these are all facts. we lost many innocent lives and still spend billions of dollars because we went after sadaam and his "fake" weopons. i will never trust another republican in my life. ohhh! heres the irony of it all!!!!!<br>  cheney gets no bid contracts to rebuid the country hes demolishing! except hes not even rebuilding it! just banking the cash! how could the free market on wall street fail with this kind of mentality? fatten the pockets on top sacrifice the majority on the bottom. noones taking your guns. its your right in the constitution,<br>  <br>   noone will ever take it like bush did with your rights and the patriot act. you just might not be able to roam main street with an oozie idiot!|`|B42PBRk6aa	He sure as h*ll DIDN'T start off SPENDING a trillion dollars! <br>  Your congress just passed ANOTHER spending package of over 400 billion dollars of DEBT.<br>  You going to pay that off?|`|o8FRo3pWaa	Obama has no clue about the economy|`|AosW4IvHaa	I say so far so good.

Obama believes that those of us who succeed, should give up some of our success to someone else, who didn't do what was necessary to succeed themselves.  It makes me very angry.

No child left behind , granted did to a whole lot, but this problem of the teachers unions trying to get more money out of all of us for their wallets and not the kids has always been.

Bad people were bad before he ever showed up  4)  Monica Lewinski did Clinton, and George Bush had nothing to do with it  5) Jennifer Flowers did Clinton too, and yep, George Bush had nothing to do with that either....  6) Bush spent 100 billion in last the last FY....Obama is spending 3 times as much....and yes, 3 times means he is spending more....  7)  I did your girlfriend last night and George Bush had nothing to do with it.....  8)  When something bad happens to you tomorrow, George Bush will have had nothing to do with it.....  9)  You are responsible for your own happiness, not the Government/Barrack Obama, and yes, not George Bush  10)  You are angry, that's cool, and you being an accountable person (not), means, George Bush has nothing to do with that    Barney, the pillow biter, Frank ran crazy and no one stopped him.  The American consumers that bought homes they could not afford, cars they definitely could not afford, were the problem.    The banks, were not.  Ever heard of the phrase, "Caveat Emptor"?  Let the buyer beware....if you are so stupid as to buy a house and treat the mortgage like a credit card, play against the house (the libor) and think....you are going to win, means you are so flippin' stoooooopid, you NEED to be homeless, out of a job, lose your family and end up on Jerry Springer with the rest of the "Democrats".    Buying things you can't knowlingly afford means there is probably a consequence (foreign term to democrats) is coming your way and you might actually have to be held accountable (more foreign term to democrats) and endure the consequences.    But no, there's hope.  Because people like Pelosi see this as a golden opportunity to get you on the bailout hook for your stupidity and you take it, hook, line, and sinker....    Yeah....something like that....oh and by the way, George Bush had nothing to do with any of you that bought those things you can't afford but, rest assured,     Barrack Obama is going to make sure people like ME who did the right things all these years, lived below their means, paid their bills on time, never missed a payment, honored their creditors and basically fed the engine known as taxes so some folks could live like drunk sailors on payday are going to pay for those mistakes...

iuurJCzTaa	Q: How are the living quarters they give you?   A: Aboard a ship you will be seperated from the men's living quarters. On shore, you will live in barracks(like dorms) or have a house/appartment in the area depending on where you are stationed.    Q: How is the pay?  A: The pay chart is here: http://www.navycs.com/09militarypaychart...  As full time active duty, you will be making $1300-1400 a month depending on rank and time in service. As a reservist drilling on every fourth weekend and a few weeks out of the year, you will be making much less a month.    Q: Would you consider the experience a good one?   A: Yes. Lots of travel if thats what you want.    Q: Give me any information you can, I'm wondering alot of things. Like, once I'm settled into my job - can I have people come visit me where I am?   A: Yes, people can visit, and you can visit them on your off time or on leave.(personal time/vacation). Unless you are in a war zone, or stationed overseas, then it might be either difficult or very expensive.(for them to come to you)    Q: Do I have any contact with the outside world while I'm working?   A: Yes. You will always have access to email, writing, and most likely internet even on a ship.    Q: What if I decide to leave, how does that work?   A: Depends on your contract. There is full time(active duty), and part time(reserves). Once you are signed up it is very difficult to break the contract, and do not get discharged without an honorable or medical discharge.     Q: Anything you feel you should mention, please do. I want to have as much information possible before I go & speak to someone about it.    A: Once you are in, make sure what ever happens to you physically, like illnesses, injuries etc make sure they are in your record. You can review your medical records periodically.    After taking the tests to see what you qualify for, make sure you get your training in your contract(see it in writing). Most jobs require special training that will last anywhere from several weeks to several months. Get the GI Bill in your contract. Take CLEP/DANTES exams for college credit, for military members it is very inexpensive, sometimes free. You can compile enough credits for a degree within a few years.     The following link has test scores and jobs specific to the Navy.  http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navy/l/bl...    Good luck!|`|mMnRmYvNaa	I was a Navy Recruiter (and a JAG), so I had a lot of fleet time and loved every minute of it. Really got to see the world Oman -- Diego -- Pearl -- Orlando -- DC -- Hong Kong -- Perth Australia -- what a blast.    Once you're in, if you "leave" without being "on leave" you can do 5 years in Leavenworth for that. If you don't like it -- stick around and do your job anyway until your Navy commitment is over.    You also have to follow orders. It's not like civilian life at all. The officers over you tell you what to do, and if you don't do it, you can go to the Brig for a long time -- if you are at sea, you can be put on bread and water in confinement.    These are just insights that might help you -- trying to avoid stupid nonsense -- like you said, right?     People are not going to be able to visit you while you are on duty in the Navy, or on a ship at sea. On a naval base, they can come and visit during certain hours only. If you are on leave you can go home and visit them.    Try to get the recruiter to give you the strongest possible promise that you will get the kind of work you have asked for and negotiated for.     If possible, get the Commanding Officer of the Recruiting Office to sign the part of the papers where the promises are made about duty stations and job assignments. This helps the Navy to stay reminded about what they promised as part of your recruitment contract. You can't get out of the contract -- but you don't have to get in unless you are 100% satisfied with the deal -- if the deal doesn't sound just right -- walk away! There are other recruiters, there are other days, there are other services -- take a look at the Air Force -- Always know you Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) before you sit down to negotiate -- don't let the Recruiter tell you what your best alternative to signing up right now is -- they know how to make the alternative look really grim. You should know it -- before you sit down. And run it through your mind carefully before you sign the deal. Once you sign -- it's not revolkable -- you have sealed your fate -- the Navy can kick you out, but you can't "leave" if you don't like it.|`|0i8mypwDaa	Nope...I don't swim well.

She really enjoyed it. She was in the British Navy though. As with all services, you 'sign up' to a term. I think all service people look back fondly at their career. You learn skills you cant get elsewhere and you have fun. the camoradaree is great and make some great pals who will last your lifetime, see the world etc. But, also whether you are in Admin or not, if there is a war or domestic conflab, you will be there right on it. Even if you are out of the services for a while and then something flares up, you can be called back to arms. This is somethign to consider obviously.     My cousin was also in the british navy. He was in submarines, and had no contact for months at a time, came back home with a full on beard aged only 25 (as you cant shave in a sub) and now works in TV. He had a great time, made loads of freinds, and all that jazz, but I know he had difficulty re-entering civvie life. He couldnt settle down and stuff liek that. He missed the group of people he was set with, who he had been with for years and it was the source of ALL his conversation for some years after he was pensioned off...   He came home a lot and had a lot of leave etc and everything, but you will find that there are a lot of tests they do and you are placed where they want you to be placed, rather than where You want to be placed. He, and our lodger, both said, that the more flexible you are, the better it is. There are lots of innitiation things... boots set alight and thrown in pools of water and downing pints of rum etc... but less so for the girls. Health and safety get in the way of a lot of antics, but most of them are looked on with fondness after the event, but at the time might seems a little rough. If you are one to take a joke and have fun and not think too mich of yourself as above others, then the services will be ok. But its a job with your full human body involved, not just your brain.

Which means they accredited themselves) you should be fine.  I would certainly call/email the appropriate regional accreditation and find out their exact status.  Else, don't take a chance and go to a State University.  Nearly all those will accept CCAF credits.|`|WL3KcegWaa	Having been in your shoes....    You are better served by getting a "real" degree.  Having said that, I know prior enlisted have gone to OTS with a degree from universities such as Phoenix, Park and Columbia.  However there are very few.  The selection process for Air Force OTS is extremely competitive and getting even more so as the number of officers is drawn done. Your choice of universities can add to or detract from the strength of your package.    In other words you want the most desirable package that the board is going to see.  If you have two otherwise equal candidates and one has a CCAF and BS from Columbia State and the other has a formal BS from an accredited state or private university who would you pick?|`|LsMJM1bBaa	Yes, actually nationally accredited is typically preferred to regional.  As long as it's a recognized accreditation organization.    I commissioned with a nationally accredited degree.  As an engineer working towards my professional engineer's license, I would require 2 extra years of experience for a license had my degree only been regionally accredited.    But the only Columbia State University I could find came up with this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_St...  Definately not what you want.  Check DANTES for approved schools.

WyCmQBuvaa	Yes it is a big case of sexual harassment.  Just because he is not hitting on you or pressuring you for sex - doesn't mean it is.  He is making you uncomfortable viewing this personal sexual material.  Keep doing what you are doing and protect yourself.  He probably thinks that since you didn't object in the beginning, that it is ok - maybe you even get a kick out of it.  I know you don't want to piss him off, but this has to stop.  Next time he asks for something, I'd ask if he had a minute, you need to talk to him.  Do it away from other employees, talk to him as a friend, that he thinks you are. Tell him you are happy to help him out with any work related jobs.  You are very uncomfortable with his sexually explicit personal business.  You are really busy now and for these reasons, you are sorry but can't do it anymore.    Don't let him intimidate you.  He is the one that has broken so many laws.  How would his bosses react if they knew that he was using company time, resources, computers and YOU in his sordid sex prowling?  Let's say he gets caught, or if there is some child porn, - you know he will say that you did it.|`|OYDfF3W9aa	just dont mind it sexual harrasment is cool i do it all the time|`|iOqmoIrcaa	No, it is not sexual harassment.  It is an abuse of your time, but that is no one's fault but your own.  Tell him that you are new with the company, and struggling to do the work, so you don't have time right now for personal tasks.  If he gives you the only a minute routine, point out that you are certain as a senior employee of the company he knows how important it is for everyone to pull their weight and get their work done on time, and that is all you are trying to do.  You just want to be efficient and not let the other members of your team down.  Keep throwing it back on him until he gives up.  If he tries to make trouble for you, then you have your diary.  You should also check out the company's policy on using the company computers for personal use, and their policy on pornography on company computers.  If they have that policy in place, point that out to him.  If he continues, then you need to go to his supervisor and ask what to do, as you don't want the company to think this was all your idea.|`|7kPvV8EXaa	He probably is not as powerful in the company as he thinks he is.  I hate it, but finding a new job may be in line.      Homosexual males tend to get a kick out of the fact that they have a penis and love to make others uncomfortable.  I figure it is because of how uncomfortable and shamed they must feel all the time.      This guy needs to find a new cupid.  If these things arent in your job description and if you arent working in a strip club or a porn store, I would find it very impropriate.      If you dont want to leave the job, I would consider telling him that you dont want those images in your head (true).  Thank him and tell him that should you ever feel the need to see some handsome naked men, he will be the first stub you will call.  Then leave the room.|`|EvlPzrVOaa	if you have a human resource department they deal with it. now since you have been wasting 1 hr a day on non work they might let you go.  since it is sexual in manner it is sexual harassment. now write a letter of what has been going on. clear concise an not pointing fingers.if there is human resources go to them if not go to the manager. if nothing happens go to your local job service an they will carry on fr there.|`|Hu4sEk2Faa	This is an indirect form of sexual harassment. I honestly feel that you should tell him no. Don't be another victim of getting fired becase of that. It's nice that you talk to him but do not get involved. Tell him you're uncomfortable looking at that. He should understand.|`|Xk2nBM8raa	I don't think it is sexual harassment because you are assisting him in writing letters and emails. It is bad employee conduct on both parties though. If you don't want to help him anymore, then tell him that you are uncomfortable doing it. If he pushes the subject, go above his head.     But, other than that, I don't see it as any type of sexual harassment towards you. Sorry.|`|GCl3TjyAaa	Yes it is. 100%  If you sued you get our would get a lot of money from the company for allowing this to go on. Even if they had no idea it was going on. The laws of sexual harassment are very simple.|`|58192bcbad2d46083c349accabc3fcdeaa	I believe this is called "hostile work environment". First your really need to tell him that you are uncomfortable and then you need to file a report with your HR office about the incidents then have transpired and then they will take it from there. Good luck!
79505ca68c46ff33cc40ab5e27efa1c3aa	That is hard..Perhaps it should be amended. I mean I feel as though everyone should be able to bear arms.  However by everyone I mean every law abiding citizen.  There should be a mental exam.  And a ban on the military style (AK 47 etc.)  Additionaly if you are on parole or convicted of a crime you lose your right to bear arms|`|iGnUYe9Haa	No, norway has more guns than anyone, however they have a very low violence rate.  They require military time also.  Not my cup of tea, but it shows that the problem is the people, not the availibility of guns.|`|g8Nx6mp3aa	No, never. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall NEVER EVER be infringed. I love America too much for that to happen. Guns will always be gained illegally, regardless of what you try.|`|mkxzt2MPaa	when america was being designed. the men wanted to protect americans from a corrupt crime like government who charges taxes and invades peoples homes. if you don't feel threatened by the merger of big business and american government try running for office and see how hard it is to get in. you have to be well funded before the big dogs let you play.   if you throw out the constitution you are not an American. that's how i feel about it.|`|0cM3vCtbaa	" if you beat your guns into plow sheres you will plow for those who did not"    that amendment was put in place to keep the government in check|`|Gr99OjQuaa	im not big on guns. dont own any and dont care to own any. however, i do believe that its a right protected by the constitution and should be protected.    you said  "criminals having guns and guns being obtained illegally"    if you remove the 2nd amendment, do you think criminals wont obtain guns anymore? the only people youre harming is the noncriminals who obtain them legally.      "i dont agree with what you say, but ill defend your right to say it"|`|ivsKcwwvaa	OK, first off, the President has no say in constitutional amendments at all. Second, you cannot remove a constitutional amendment,. You repeal them by creating a new one. Third, Congress cannot on it's own amend the constitution.  3/4 of the states must ratify the amendment, with a 2/3 majority vote in each states congress.     Next, if the 2nd amendment were repealed, states would lose their right to maintain a national guard. Kind of cutting their own throat.     Finally, if the feds were to reintroduce the draft, there is the possibility it could be ruled unconstitutional, under the 13th amendment. If that were to happen, the feds would need the states to do it for them, under the 2nd.      NOT LIKELY|`|AA11598520	No, it should be followed according to the words in it: Militia should carry the guns. Removing it will only stop law abiding citizens from getting guns. Criminals always find a way.|`|8iAOasaxaa	Well Brother O is already working on the first|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	So you want to alter the constitution.  At least you realize that it would not work until all the criminals had no guns.  Course then they would just use knives like the criminals in the UK do.  What's next remove knives.  Crooks will always find some kind of weapon and they will always use that weapon on people who cannot defend themselves.|`|bXn6WGaXaa	How would the logistics of removing all of the illegally obtained firearms work? It seems like making them illegal and siezing them would be the best way, and, oh, wait a minute, WE"RE ALREADY DOING THAT!  Would we make it more illegal than it is now? Is that it? More laws, more government interference? How would we go about implementing this part of the plan?    As for the second part of the plan, how do you plan on taking my gun from me? My advice would be to bring a lot of friends- and prepare to lose a lot of them.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	I would like to see it go but expect it would take a couple of generations for repeal to be effective.|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	No...    Good Example is the community outside Atlanta that had a disastrous crime rate.  The entire town was ordered  to have a firearm in their house unless they where a convicted felon.  The crime rate plummeted.    Virginia Tech, Blacksburgh was a Gun Free Zone.  Look what happened.

The Founding Fathers excluded all religion from the US government and placed the military under civilian authority for the same reason - they distrusted both and wanted to protect the nation and its citizens from their rule.    Jefferson believed that citizens must be armed in order to resist government (their government) attempts to take away the personal freedom and individual liberties.    "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." - Thomas Jefferson, proposed Virginia constitution, June 1776. 1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J.

Regards.|`|7vBJGMvtaa	good question! you may be the first Democrat i have to respect for your intelligent question,i am one of those who is saying what you are referring to! i am so use to having Democrats call you names rather than changing my way of thinking about obama with facts.     Now to explain what i mean not necessarily the republicans as a whole but just what i see is going on here.  ok let us look at what is really happening going on here,remove obama being president first,just focus on is going in the world right now,ok lets go back to President Jimmy carter he had the Iran Hostage Crisis,he also got egypt to sign a peace agreement with Israel but they both suffered a assassination in the process but Jimmy will be remembered for 4 things only the iran hostage crisis,the recession, oil shortage crisis,and being a one perm president!then came Pres Reagan who freed the hostages and had BUSH SR. as his vice pres but he left the presidency one of the most popular presidents in American history!over shadowing Jimmy carter and saving the hostages with force even though we all found out later he pad for them then came another Rep Bush sr.who did ok until he went into IRAQ to save kuwatt from saddam and became the hero but then came ZIPPERGATE BILL you know who i mean and Bill Clinton did nothing about Iraq and saddam for 10 yrs and nobody seem to say what obama said about Bush jr.last 8 yrs,for 10 yrs Clinton was costing America the same amount of money for 10 yrs as bush did for 8 yrs!  yet everybody is acting like bush was the only one to do this! why?clinton started NAFTA which gave big industries reasons to go abroad to get their product assembled for as low as 43 cents an hr but obama won his election on the reason for job losses was the war,and the last 8 yrs in iraq but his predecessor Clinton was also responsable for that as well,so now we have a new president Obama who is making out of this world promises,someone with no experience,who never finished his first term as a senator what's wrong with this?this would be like having a rookie leader in england during ww2 what would have happened if when the japanese bombed pearl harbour we had a rookie president what would have happened ?i am sure you can do the math well this what having obama as president in this time is like! this has nothing to do with obama being black even though i feel being black is a liability not an asset for ovious reasons and as much as in a perfect world would be nice we do live in a racist world! Denzel Washington once said he was reading a news paper with his face hidden and a man came up to him and told him to move ***_er until he saw it was Denzel and apologize but it was too late so my point here is having a black president won't benefit anyone black except obama and this is why i don't know why everyone has such high expectations!sad to say!the truth is the only people that can change their image in the world would be the people of the black culture with less drug use and crime!that is not up to obama!  So to end my statement >we have the problems of global Terrorism,war in iraq,afganistan,a recession almost as big as the big depression,job losses as never been seen before,car companies going under(never before seen in history)and that is only the tip of the ice burg not to mention iran threats,israel palestinian problems and a rookie president who never finished his first term as a senator,never was a governor and has the least experience running anything of all his competition which included 20 yr vet john mccain 8 yr vet hillary clinton and a governor Sarah Palin who even has more experience than obama! what is wrong with this picture something is not matching here don't you think?|`|oYaGeDewaa	seriously you haven't a clue. 2003-2007 were great years. the economy fluctuates|`|3NKOVaNhaa	Oh trust me, we're already down that wrong path(8 years) and now we're lost and can't find are way back AND our car(Economy) is broken down.

I'm not a republican, an ex-democrat thanks to Obama, and the Liberal hate for Sarah Palin.  Obama is dumber than Bush Jr.  Just call him Bush lite.   Didn't you hear him say during the debates that he would take the US into Darfur.  Our "moral obligations" he called it.   He doesn't have the experience necessary to extract us from the financial crisis.  What he is doing is borrowing and spending more money.   That is the same thing Bush Jr. did.   Yeah,he is leading you somewhere you have never thought about going.  Into the heart of Africa to free his black bros.  Fortunately for our young men we will be flat on our backsides and down on our oopsies by then, and there won't be money to make war over there in that god forsaken country.

We have passed 1and most likely 2 stimulus packages that will do anything but stimulate the economy. While Bush and the Republican Congress were in office unemployment was at an all-time low.|`|AA11711276	Yes; we're likely to lose our enemies and have no further need to invade their countries.

5gG2OfHIaa	I mostly agree with your statement.  Where I might differ just a bit is that some enterprising welfare queens work underground or under the table because they have time to waste.  During stronger economies the queens can demand higher dollar payments vs. during a recessionary downturn.  On balance, my guess would be that the group is indifferent to economic cycles because their lifestyle is set.  A more pressing problem in their world would be fitting their children in a welfare package for life.  And they know  the rules better than the government workers who oversee these temporary programs.|`|uspTM9cuaa	Sure. The welfare dollar goes further when everything is on sale.|`|v1a0PHdwaa	There is no such thing as a welfare queen  Step out of the 80's there CB that mythology was shown to be false long ago|`|8yAQjqRpaa	you think of that all by yourself?...........BRAVO!|`|Irjopfpvaa	Wow, you figure that out yourself? Genius!    I bet you also figured out even if you put together all the welfare queens' benefits, it's still loose change compared to the billions and trillions of tax breaks and other welfare benefits the corporations are receiving, even after the economy starts to collapse.|`|vKR4tysjaa	Correct.  They should STFU, really!|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	Actually, recessions mean more people needing assistance, meaning less benefits for each individual.

2uDlTBuUaa	I know it's hard not to think of things like that when he is so far away but you have to have faith in your relationship.  This is the first time he will be away from you but unfortunately it probably won't be the last time while he is in the army.  You have to believe your relationship is strong enough to endure the separation and actually strengthen it in the long run.  Stay positive AIT will be over before you know it.|`|lsHsXXtuaa	If he is a good guy then he won't cheat on you or do something inappropriate. However there must be some reason why you're worried. Perhaps you don't trust him as much as you think you do.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	If you are going to be an Army wife you had better learn to trust your soldier.  Don't and you'll drive yourself crazy everytime he leaves.  Besides if he's going to cheat there is nothing you can do about it.  Just like he can't control wether or not you cheat.  Frankly I hear about more spouses cheating on their soldier than the other way around.|`|QTQTdPO1aa	You need counceling.  Not being a jerk, but it's true.  You need to feel complete and love yourself and you will feel better about him being gone.      If a man is going to cheat, he's going to do it if he's with you every day or if he's away.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	Trust in the relationship goes a long way. If you trust him then you should have no problems and yes, if he wanted to cheat he could do it here just as easily as he would 10,000 miles away. Stop worrying about it, stay positive and support him through it. He will appreciate you way more than you can imagine.|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	If you have a strong relationship with him he should be fine.  I know plenty of guys who don't get involved in that kind of stuff.  The stories you hear are from guys who have never been away from home before and don't know what to do with all the freedom (if you can call it that).  Write him often to remind him of how much you miss him.  I know I really looked forward to mail call.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Just because you hear the stories doesn't mean it will happen.  You could easily cheat on him.  If you trust him then you don't have to worry about it, if you are having questions about your relationship then you have to worry.  If you don't trust each other then how will the marriage survive?  You always hear stories about the cheaters and the divorce, stopped listening to them and focus on the stories you don't hear, the ones where cheating doesn't happen and either does divorce.  Look at the positive relationships.      Focus on your relationship, focus on getting ready to move, focus on your child, focus on the positives, not the negatives.  before you know it AIT will be over and you can be together again.  This separation now is preparing you for later when he is deployed.

This is a portion of a letter from the Media Relations Manager of the American Legion, which you too could've found online if you'd tried to seek the whole truth:    "President Obama was invited but did not attend. Vice-President Joe Biden did appear, however, and was very warmly received. The new Presidents absence was understandable considering the unprecedented logistical challenges presented by the vastly increased number of visitors to this inauguration and the necessary attendant security measures. The American Legion, as an organization, does not feel offended or snubbed. "    Thank you,     Craig Roberts     Media Relations Manager     The American Legion     1608 K Street, NW     Washington, DC 20006     202.263.2982 (direct)|`|711R4J6saa	I don't believe the US military holds him in the highest regard!|`|AA11614944	Disgusting, I did not know this.|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	Scott Isaacs, contributor to Newsvine.mobi (an open source news service) was the one who contacted the American Legion to inquire about this.  Please read the whole thing, below, which I lifted directly from the site.  Draw your own conclusions.    From American Legion spokesman Craig Roberts:    The American Legion, as it has on every inauguration evening since 1953, hosted the Salute to Heroes Inaugural Banquet &  Ball on January 20th.  The quadrennial event is co-sponsored with fourteen veterans service and military service organizations and honors recipients of the Medal of Honor.  Forty-seven of these heroes attended this years event which was held in the Renaissance Washington DC Hotel.    President Obama was invited but did not attend.  Vice-President Joe Biden did appear, however, and was very warmly received.  The new Presidents absence was understandable considering the unprecedented logistical challenges presented by the vastly increased number of visitors to this inauguration and the necessary attendant security measures.  The Vice President was able to join us this evening, and we are thankful he was able to make the time to do so.    Thank you,  Craig Roberts    First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Roberts for taking my call and taking the time to compose this statement so that I can share it on behalf of the American Legion. So to those fellow Obama supporters that think this ball did not happen, it did. It was omitted from the media outlets it was omitted from because of logistical challenges due to the extraordinary number of people that flooded Washington D.C. to see Barack Obama be inaugurated as the 44th president and it is not yet on the American Legion's website (as I type this at 8:30 A.M. on 1-23-09) because of some difficulties in updating the website. However, there will be media coverage of the event forthcoming.     I have found out also that the likely reason that Barack Obama attended the auxiliary balls that he did is because six of the balls that he attended were held in the same building. Therefore, attending those balls and the others that he attended were the most efficient with regards to security. It is no secret that President Obama has had questions surrounding his security, that is evident by observing that he was the earliest presidential candidate ever to get a security detail. If the Secret Service felt it prudent to guard him so early in the campaign can the reader imagine what the Secret Service feels is prudent now that he is the President of the United States?     The most likely reason that President Obama did not go to the "Salute to Heroes" inaugural ball is because it was held in the Renaissance Hotel which consists of 16 floors. There was an event called the "Illinois Party - Presidential Event" held at the Renaissance the night before that the then-President-elect did not attend either (I have a call in to the President's press office asking for confirmation of this information which was given to me by one of my sources for this story). Given the amount of time and resources it would have taken to clear a 16 floor hotel as well as protect it while President Obama was inside, I can only guess that he was advised by his Presidential Protection Detail not to attend either inaugural ball because of the building and the inherent problems in securing and then protecting it. The sheer number of people crowding the streets and staying in the hotel surely presented a formidable screening problem as well. But, there's your story... it's not as sexy as "Barack Obama Hates The Military" but it is the truth as best I can tell after talking to the organization responsible for hosting the event and doing some research and educated guesswork about why a security team wouldn't want to protect a principal in the Renaissance with more than 2 million extra people in Washington D.C.     Update: It would appear that, according to Stars & Stripes that Obama had some Medal of Honor recipients at an inaugural ball that he attended. This gives the number of living Medal of Honor recipients as 99, but I believe that two have passed away since that number was compiled leaving 97. There are 7 in this picture and there were 47 at the American Legion inaugural event. I'm curious if there were more at the event this photo was taken at.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	Isn't Obama the same guy that was saying all our troops were doing in Iraq was killing babies and terrorizing people?|`|AA11268819	How much more proof do we need that we have a communist in the White House.

After all he spent 150 million dollars on his inauguration ball , there should have been plenty of money to get him an entire division of people for security.  It was sickening today when he said that he had first sent out a hearty thank you to all the troops defending America and had discussed many things with his Pentagon Chiefs and they knew they were respected and had his utmost respect and support . I almost gagged . He still can't look you in the eye when he speaks . He knows the eyes are the windows to the soul and so if he looks you in the eye you will know what he already knows and has know for a long while, he can say what he wants but it's a good thing they don't hook him up to a lie detector when he speaks.|`|NCSxPWQvaa	Barry does not salute to the military.
qiabEG8naa	Sorry Lovin' Obama girl, you can't afford to roll the dice with 819 Billion.  He's black and so are you.  And based on the fact that 95% of your demographic voted for this guy (who is racist now?  Imagine if 95% of the whites voted this way, your folks would riot), hands down tells me that your opinion is just to subjective.  You would give him a pass if he had a bag of money under his arm running away from a bank robbery....    This is the biggest spending bill in history, period.  5 billion for failed Amtrak (securing democratic votes), 50 million for The Endowment of the Arts (securing rich democratic votes), and it goes on and on.....2/3's of it is simply kickbacks to democratic votes in the form of no taxes, government checks.....    Look, spend the money on things that WILL stimulate the economy QUICKLY.  Like drop the FICA on corporations (you would see that on your NEXT check), cut corporate taxes (highest in the world), give tax credits to new home buyers, reduce the lowest income bracket taxes by 5%....you know, IMMEDIATE help....and get this, you don't have to sift through it all, it's relatively fair as it is applied across the board....    It's almost a good idea.....sigh...but no, Pelosi and her crooks will spend as much of it as possible shoring up votes...which has absolutely nothing to do with stimulating the economy....and people voted this cabal in as fast as they could.....    Well, you know what they say, those that forget the past are inevitably doomed to relive it.....|`|bXn6WGaXaa	I like your zero to question mark ratio. It really does lessen the blow.

They even slashed science research that benefits everyone but didn't believe in science so what do you actually expect? next you'll whine because we're negotiating instead of shooting first.|`|f260fecd5ca5dc4eb4cded2d66649c61aa	No, I liked throwing money at the Wall Street bankers and war.
Hf8DlmLqaa	There are multiple reasons why, but the biggest is that there was a good chance it wouldn't have made it through as a separate bill so they slipped it in there. Just another example of government dishonesty.|`|AA11702773	Do you mean "why is money and a mandate to violate patient privacy rights by digitalizing and centrally databasing all of everyone's medical records for ease of review by governmentally connected interests' included in the stimulus bill?<br>  <br>  If that is what you meant to ask, I would say 'because the outcry would be so much greater if they tried that as a stand alone bill.'<br>  <br>  Mind you, that is only my opinion.<br>  <br>  As to the rest, it isn't a stimulus bill.  It is a shopping list by Pelosi and incidentally a funding mechanism to remove basic appropriations from the budget so Obama can pretend to come near 'balancing the budget' by the end of his first term, regardless of growing the national debt at a record pace.|`|wlGVy803aa	Obama appears determined to get this particular issue through one way or the other.  I think it's rather deceptive placing healthcare within the so-called stimulus package along with 9,000 earmarks (pork).<br>  <br>  I believe Obama wants America to be a socialistic country.<br>  The "nationalization" of the banks and wall street bail outs and his rushing it through Congress lends strongly to my opinion.  <br>  <br>  I really hope the healthcare issue doesn't pass because we<br>  will lose quality of care, wait longer for appointments and be turned down for surgery if we caused our health problem.  The doctors will all be paid a similar salary which will cause us to lose many good doctors.  Not to mention the COST of socialization.<br>  <br>  I've never been so concerned and so angry about what is happening to and in America right now.
tQfDaUnCaa	If you dont want him to go over seas have him look into the Coast guard but the coast guard doesnt offer good bonuses, mostly nothing and the least in job selection. Army will give him the best job selection and the biggest bonuses and the fastest promotion rate but he will probably have to serve over seas. Air Force will a give you guys a good quality of living but also bonuses arent great and he may have to serve over seas. Marines will defiantly have to over seas and he will be treated the worst and go through the hardest training but the comradeship is the best. Navy; Bonuses are decent depending on job, good job selection but will have to do sea duty every once in a while.     All have there pros and cons.     All Branches have free military housing, free medical and free dental for all dependents. I hope this helped, good luck|`|Vpa3cmVyaa	Tell him to join the Air Force. Best benefits, and and he wont have to go to war. Army and Marines dont want people unless they are ready to actually SERVE and not just take the governments benefits.     Tell him thank you though|`|wvLM7NwNaa	If he can tell him to go air force, the marines go seven months on and seven months off for deployments, and the army deployments are currently 15 months.  The air force is at the top of pay charts, and has more benefits.
tKysmIY2aa	I'm a detective in PA. He has to go to your local police department and ask about employment options. At my department the city sent us to a police Academy in NY. have him inquire about it. Before I was promoted, my start off pay was $3,500.00 monthly without out taxes taken out. my detective pay is $4,000 monthly. After hes an officer (min 5 years he can apply for detective position) Normally my city covered the cost. But its different where you live. The police course was 1 year. He can't be over 30 when he applies. But ask him to go to your police department and they will tell him step-by-step on going to police Academy. good luck   buy the way make sure he is physically fit. and can do push ups sit ups, jogs, and pull ups. they require that at the Academy. Also there he will learn self defense,etc|`|pbqgHOX9aa	I live in Florida and becoming an officer is a long process.    It includes;  1. a serious background check involving family, neighbors and your acquaintances. If there have been any past arrests, good luck.  2. A physical fitness exam and test.  3. a psychological exam  4. Interviews with recruiters and supervisors.    Then you might be selected for the training academy, you will get a paycheck while there and in some instances you go to school for two weeks and then work the street with a veteran for two weeks, this goers on for 6 months at least.    Then again, in South Carolina you might just need a high school diploma and your own gun.  :)  joking    It depends too on where you apply, a city cop would not travel far but a state trooper or game warden
WyCmQBuvaa	Where did you set it down before you walked across the street for coffee?  On a bench?  Yes, report it immediatly to the police. There is a very slight chance that someone found your wallet and dropped it in a mailbox.  What else was in your wallet?  Your license or ID?  Now they have your home address.  Need to get new license MVD.  Any credit cards?  Call your bank and report them stolen.  Check if any activitysince you lost it.  Contact the credit reporting agencies - file a report.  Someone now has your ID and can make your life a nightmare, ruin your credit, etc.       Good luck.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	whats a BS?|`|41vzCmRraa	Call the police and make a report. You would be amazed at what you can do with those numbers in your wallet. Better to be safe then having someone steal you identity. That way if things do go bad, there is a report that states they were stolen.|`|emNCaAq7aa	You report it. The police may classify it as lost depending on what you say. That makes no difference. All you need is a police report of any kind.  SSA normally requires a police report number for a new original card. In the state I live in you must have an original SS card to get a license of any kind, drivers or professional.  If the information is used for identity theft you will have an easier time with a police report on file.  Call the non emergency number for the police in the town (most big cities in US its 311) where your wallet went missing and ask how to make a report.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	By BS, I am assuming you mean birth certificate?  Report it to the police, but there is nothing that can be done about that.  As for the social security card, you contact your local social security office.  They can issue you a new card, and although it will take a ton of paperwork, you can actually get a new social security number.  But filing a police report is your first step.|`|SMCa68oTaa	yes, tell the police as soon as possible, they could access your bank, any and everything... so yeah  or maybe you would like buying 78 thousand bouncy balls (jk) oh if something does happen call the credit companies and to make sure nothing strange is going on|`|6lr3NL3caa	well why in the hell was your social security card in your wallet? yea, you need to report it to the police, ss office and probably all of your credit cards and banks..somebody can steal your identity real easily now because they have your ssn and your name and address and all your info..
vXFpzKRaaa	Many people may say that we are still suffering from the Bush Administration but I say that though Bush did play a part in the decline, Obama's Administration will only make it worse.  Obama's stimulus plan is packed full of pork that will do nothing to stimulate the growth of this already poor economy but rather will only further the decline of the US's economy.  How is a tax write off for Hollywood or a tax credit toward the purchase of "green" golf carts or even money for the digital converter boxes going to stimulate the economy?  <br>  <br>  Obama's theme for his campaign was all about change but notice he didn't say if it was for the better or for the worse.  As of right now one can only assume what kind of change he was referring to.|`|RhDPB70Baa	Scare tactics.  Make the people afraid and dependent on you for safety and they become putty in your hands.  Fear is the strongest of human emotions, and when wielded by a competent ruler it can be used to dominate even the most strong willed of men.  Fear is the ultimate weapon of the conqueror, for why waste time and money forcing someone to follow you when you can make them want to?|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	Blaming any one politician is extremely simplistic thinking.

I was actually planning on starting a business this year, but after that clueless coward Barack Obama won the presidency, I took my business idea and threw it right in the garbage.  Ironically, my business idea was mainly geared towards helping the unemployed in our country, but I see zero reason why I should bust my hump for 60+ hours a day building an enterprise when Barack Obama is going to reward my success by taking more of my money to bail out people who are probably much smarter by not working and taking the free lunch he is offering instead.  Even my parents are considering early retirement because they know that Obama's stimulus will help babysit them (and they did not vote for him either).    This is NOT the America I signed up for!|`|eqDXoCeTaa	Even better, tell your boss you'll work for cash, but 50% less than you already make.

For example the automotive industry, yea the owners are trying their best for a bailout but if they don't get it there just gonna file bankruptcy and go retire in their mansions while thousands of americans loose their jobs and are forced into unemployment and an economy that's not exactly giving jobs out.     Also you have to remember the katrina victims that are still trying to rebuild their city, and the veterans who deploy only to come home to an employer went bankrupt and now they don't have a job.     What about the teachers who decided to teach in areas that don't have much funding because somebody has to do it, the college student that came from a low income family that has work full time, while taking a full course load. They all rely on food stamps to make life easier.    And don't get me started on Joe the Plumber, or even Bob the builder.    Recession doesn't happen overnight may factors contributed to this country's economic condition, and it wont be fixed overnight all we can do is try different things until something works. If you were to loose your job you would appreciate all the help you can get.|`|2g7niBEIaa	I see your point, and may I say, it's a good one.

Yea, why work anyway--right. You should also go have some babies so after your unemployment runs out you can keep those food stamps and qualify to go live in some really cheap housing. You should quit so those of us still working can now support you.. SMART  :-)|`|cKxWR3Zgaa	Lol.  Welfare recipients aren't living high off the hog or anything.  So if you want to live in a section 8 apartment and 1-2K a month(with several of dependents mind you) than by all means quit. If that's the type of lifestyle you want to live then by all means go on welfare.    Edit: I know your being sarcastic and I simply answered your question.  If you think that living off of $300 with 3 kids is living then you should really wake up.  Yes welfare is a broken system, however lets stop acting like welfare recipients are balling out of control.|`|f4doqdSCaa	Of course you aren't 'stupid' for working. You do realize that unemployment is at a very high level in some areas (nearly 10% in Los Angeles, for instance). A lot of people aren't working because they really CAN'T find a job (a friend's husband is in this position, and they have kids. He's willing to work, but is having a very hard time finding a job, ANY job). The economy is in the toilet, yes it stinks when you feel you're working and others are getting benefits for not working, but the fact is, if you were to 'quit or get fired', just to take advantage of a system that you obviously think is wrong, it wouldn't solve anything, in fact you'd be contributing to the problem, and only making things worse.|`|rLKfRTSPaa	Pride and self achievement.

It's not going to last forever. 2.) People don't get a whole lot on those programs. 3.) Loss of dignity. You may not realize it now, but anybody with any morals would probably end up feeling very bad about purpously walking away from a job just to get a "free ride" and take it away from those who really need it.    It's just my opinion and I hope it helps answer your question.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	You do realize that with so many people losing their jobs, they do have to increase the amount they give out to people who are forced to go on welfare until they can find work and the people who are drawing unemployment, right? That money has to come from somewhere and these hard working people need support while they are down on their luck.     Also, these people who are living off of welfare aren't living the high life. Some abuse it, sure, but most of them are using every penny to support their families.     Have a little compassion. That's what is wrong with the world today. We don't care about anyone but ourselves. I'm doing okay...my bills are paid....screw the family down the street. It's not my problem they both lost their job and their kids are hungry. The President is trying to ease things a bit for them until this country gets back on our feet. Why does that piss you off?|`|0SnvEgeiaa	Evidently you are all employed.... In case people haven't recognised, hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs a month...Pretty soon we will have a 10% unemployment rate. People that lose their jobs still have to eat, they still have children, they still have responsibilities. Are you suggesting that the government not take care of these people, who are victimised as a result of the greed of those at the highest level in our society? The prez obviously realises that there are victims of this situation. Victims whose worlds are crumbling because of circumstance.    I'm sure there will be some that take advantage, as there are with any free money offer, but jeez not everyone is tryna get over on someone..    The lack of consideration for one's fellow man astounds me sometimes.|`|wLXb06EUaa	So...what would you suggest? Should there be a law that the rich must support the poor?

In any case,    1st: Freedom of speech, religion, press, and peaceful assembly     2nd: Right to keep and bear arms (aka own firearms)    3rd: The government can't force you to house and feed soldiers in peacetime.    4th: We are free from unreasonable searches and seizures of our homes, our bodies, or our property, conducted by government officials, and any search/arrest warrants must have proper information.    5th: Four main parts:  1 - We can't be forced to give court testimony that would incriminate ourselves, 2 - once we have been found not guilty of a crime, the government can't charge us again for the same crime, 3 - the government can't take private property for public use without justification and giving the owner proper compensation for it, 4 - before being charged with a capital crime or other serious crime, our case must be reviewed by a grand jury.    6th: We have a right to a speedy trial, and be represented by a lawyer, have the chance to challenge prosecution witnesses, call witnesses for our defense, and have a trial by jury of our peers if charged with a crime.    7th: We have a right to have civil cases heard by a jury.    8th: The government can't use torture or excessively cruel punishments nor can they require excessive bail.    9th: Just because a right is not listed in the Constitution or its amendments doesn't mean that the right doesn't exist.  In other words, this demonstrates that the Constitution doesn't grant rights, it protects them, and these listed in particular.    10th: If the Constitution doesn't specifically grant a power to the federal government, it automatically stays with the people and/or state governments.|`|CBx6qHztaa	They are already in normal language.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	As a group, they're a reminder that the Constitution is not the final law, and that certain things are not subject to regulation by the government.|`|579dbea670ea729b45a8bb3b6eb038c1aa	They mean nothing to most liberals or our education system.

That way you can understand it yourself|`|AA10015960	United States Constitutions Bill of Rights  Though there are twenty-seven amendments in the United States Constitution the first ten that were ratified in 1791 are known today as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments represent the foun  dation upon which all other amendments were built upon. The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 with the intention to stop the federal government from infringing on the affairs and individual freedoms of United State citizens. Without any of these rights the government today would have more power over individuals then the original settlers originally intended when drafting the United States Constitution.    Amendment 1    Freedom of Speech and Assembly- In the first of the ten amendments this amendment promises that United States Citizens have the freedom of speech which includes gestures, freedom in the press, and other forms of expression. The first amendment also allows citizens to peacefully congregate and assemble to petition the government for grievances or any problems that they would like to have resolved.    Amendment 2    Right to keep and bear arms- The second amendment gives citizens the right to own have guns in their possession. This amendment was created so that if the government at any point became to powerful and the citizens wanted to destroy it and create a new government they would have the power and the means to do so.    Amendment 3    Protection from quartering of troops- This amendment makes it illegal for soldiers to take up stay in the household of citizens. Though it may seem useless in today's society, it was created because back when the English ruled over the colonies many times the soldiers that were sent over seas from Great Britain would invade the households of those colonists using their houses as a place to live.    Amendment 4    Protection from unreasonable search and seizure- The fourth amendment gives citizens the right to privacy. This amendment makes it illegal for government officials to search and seize any property such as houses, anything on a person, papers, and affects without proper cause, which has been okayed and affirmed by a judge.    Amendment 5    The right to due process, double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and eminent domain-    -Due Process- Gives citizens the right to have a fair and speedy trial in the court of law before any of their freedoms can be taken away from them.    -Double Jeopardy- No citizen can be tried in court for the same crime twice. This law was created so that the government could not repeatedly prosecute you over and over again until you were found guilty.    -Self-Incrimination- "I plead the fifth." If you have ever watched an episode of Law and Order on TV I am positive you have heard that quote before. When someone says they plead the fifth it is referring to this amendment, which states that, a person does not have to testify against ones self in the court of law. No one but yourself can force you to testify in front of a judge or jury.    Eminent Domain- This law in the amendment allows the government to take your personal property but if it is done it must be compensated for at a fair market value. Though a police officer may commandeer your car, he must then pay for the fair market value of that car.    Amendment 6    The right to a trial by jury- The sixth amendment gives citizens the right to a trial by an impartial jury of their peers and a speedy trial. This amendment also gives citizens the right to have an attorney even if the defendant cannot afford one (An attorney will be paid for and appointed to a defendant if the defendant cannot afford one) and has the right to be prosecuted in the district where the crime has been committed.    Amendment 7    Civil trial by jury- If a lawsuit in a court case exceeds twenty dollars you have the right to have a trial by jury. Though this amendment allows for you to have a trial by jury you must first request it from the judge before it is granted to you.    Amendment 8    Prohibition of excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment- This amendment makes it illegal for judges to set bail at excessively high amounts and it makes it illegal for courts and officials of the law to treat or condemn you to cruel and unusual punishment.    Amendment 9    Protection of rights not specifically written in the Bill of Rights- This amendment protects citizens by stating that anything that is not stated in the constitution cannot deny or undervalue certain rights that are retained by the people of the United States.    Amendment 10    The powers of the states and the people- In this amendment it gives the states any powers that were left out of the constitution, and any powers that were left out of the constitution or state laws to the people of the United States.

HmU1UqSeaa	Wikipedia has a "List of Anarchist Communities" here:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ana...    Probably the closest to an anarchist's ideal are Christiania in Denmark, and the Zapatista-associated autonomous municipalities in Chiapas, Mexico.    Please note that merely lacking an effective central government, as in Somalia, does not make a community anarchistic in the sense of anarchism.    *****    There is a great deal of misunderstanding of the nature  of anarchism.    Anarchists (also known as libertarians or libertarian  socialists, in the original sense of socialism as worker-  ownership-and-control of the means of production)  oppose illegitimate authority and hierarchy, and therefore  oppose capitalism and the state; anarchists do not oppose  all organization: anarchists favor voluntary, non-  hierarchical, self-organization. Anarchists do not oppose  all rules and laws; anarchists oppose rules and laws  imposed involuntarily by illegitimate authorities, such  as the state, and favor voluntarily-agreed-upon rules and  laws.    "Anarchy 101", an excellent introduction to anarchism,  can be found here:  http://tinyurl.com/2fq4d2    "An Anarchist FAQ", giving an in-depth treatment of  anarchism, can be found here:  http://www.anarchistfaq.org/    *****    News & Views for Anarchists & Activists:  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smygo/|`|U0Rvsabdaa	"Anarchist government" is an oxymoron. Anarchy is the absence of government. Anarchy is essentially social darwinism of the purest form.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	isn't that an oxy moran?      I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, & restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves & sheep. I do not exaggerate.      Thomas Jefferson|`|I0TOw1KSaa	Currently, Somalia exists under a state of anarchy.  They have no effective central government.  The largest governing body rules the southern portion.  Their capitol, Mogadishu, changes between control of militias and clan-based authorities.      Based on Somalia as an example, basically, anarchy equals power struggle.|`|28yMpUfSaa	One approximation of anarchism was in parts of Spain, especially in Catalunya, in 1936-1937.

WrDGhduxaa	In South Korea there are road blocks where the check for drunk drivers, they go straight to jail, and it is not cheap.  Not letting convicted drunks return to driving would reduce the numbers.  Long jail time for accidents is another way.

If you don't drink and drive, why would this bother anyone.|`|3DrSrzHAaa	Drunk driving is a FELONY in virtually every state.  Yet judges keep letting DWI offenders off with "probation" or ""rehab".  There was a news story in our state where a drunk driver killed a child, yet had 14 previous convictions and no jail time!  I say the first offense, rehab and probation, but after that, jail time EVERY TIME, even if that means confinement at home with an ankle bracelet, and at least 30 days of the sentence in the graybar hotel.  Lost your job?  Too bad... don't drink and drive!|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Make the first DWI a felony, $5,000 or more in fines, forfeit the car used in the offense, loss of driving privileges for 1 year, probation with random drug screenings for 1 year.    Second offense:  Time to get the offender's attention.  $15,000 in fines, forfeit the car used in the offense, 2 years in jail followed by 5 years probation with random drug screenings.  Loss of license for 5 years [day one of the license suspension is the release date from jail.].    Third offense:  $50,000 in fines, forfeit that vehicle as well. 10 years in prison, probation with drug screenings for the remainder to the violators life.  license to drive permanently revoked.    For the offense of driving while license suspended or revoked for alcohol related offenses?  3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine per offense, and, of course, forfeit the car involved.    Eventually the drunk will run out of cars that they can borrow.  Yes, the object of the fines is to break the finances of the drunk driver.  By coming down HARD on this type of stupidity society can eliminate the drunk driver from the roads.
hmA8nfA2aa	As far as being a police officer, it would make very good sense. There are many majors that they offer. Criminal justice, Accounting and Information Systems, Computer Science, Psychology, and Homeland and Corporate Security are some good examples. Earning a college degree is one of the best things that you can do if you want to become a police officer. Try to earn at least a four year degree. Learn as much as you can, and earn the highest GPA that you can. Enjoy your time in college. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about.

NrkWd4Aoaa	One aspect of the law that just about everyone will run into is the law of "Landlord and Tenant"  -- I don't know how long your paper is, but if you research the respective rights and responsiblilities of landlords and tenants, perhaps you can provide some useful information to your classmates.    Your county bar association, Fair Housing Council, and state real estate commission might have some useful resources and in many states you can research the statutes on line.      Also, you could look at some of the Yahoo questions that people ask on "Street Law" related issues?

That said because you were passed out your consent is presumed.    You may have known your were fine, however those around you had  no idea and were acting in your best interest.    I think you should be grateful instead of being mad, but that is just me.      Passing out monthly is not normal for anyone.|`|4uhyxMnmaa	After you get to the age of majority (adulthood in your state of residence), you have the right to refuse ambulance or emt care.    Inform everyone of your decision by sending the local 911 and ambulance service and emergency room of the local hospital by means of a letter of intent delivered by USPS certified mail----just to insure that they have officially accpeted delivery of your decision.    Personally, I wear a medic-alert wrist bracelet with the words "Do Not Resuscitate" to advise everyone of my wishes.  I have heard of one woman who had her chest tattooed with this term, although in medical circles this is simply a "DNR" order.|`|qMQJx0tdaa	this could actually be filed under assault and battery.. holding you down is battery, and when you say let go of me, this is from fear of your life and can be considered assault...   the emts must provide care, but since you were under 18, they could not remove you from the site, unless your parents were notified and said it was ok or it was a life threatening  situation.. .. which if you were refusing, and could prove that you were aao (awake alert and oriented) then they could not prove you needed medical treatment...   as for googling, i would try something with your state name, protocols, assault and battery.|`|RqeWpZVWaa	You have no case here if you decide to pursue legal action against the EMTs.    Because you were passed out implied consent was used. Also, the fact that you are under 18 and EMT services were notified (I'm guessing through 911), it is their legal duty to act and take you to the hospital unless you signed an AMA (Against Medical Advice) form, but because you are 18 it must be signed by a parent or guardian.     Not much you can do.|`|n8EIxO9Faa	Unfortunatly for you, being under the age of 18, you do really have a say in the matter, but you parent(s) would- when youre 18 you, if you are in a sound state of mind, can lawfully refuse care, in you case if you were of age and you refuse care and the lady held you down she would be committing a crime- battery.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	no laws.  you are a minor in the aspect of health care.  your alive aren't you?  being alive precludes everything.|`|c0a23f9219dea0c956fbebca1fda8189aa	Don't listen to the Mary N profile, she doesn't know what she's talking about.  Sending a notary letter to every ER and the ambulance crews stating that specifically, you, don't want care. Never would that happen.  NEVER!!! It's too costly to be done just for you. The er and the ambulance sees tons of people every day.  They are not going to remember you.  It's a case by case basis.        As for when you passed out.  I am slightly with you in your frustrations.  If you woke up and tried to run off/ stumble away, disoriented, then yes, she can hold you down.  Your a danger to yourself.  But, if you just kinda wake up in a, what happened?  kinda way, nice and slowly, take it easy, no anger, just confused type of way.  Just taking it all in nice and slow, then NO!! There's no reason why you should be held down.  That pisses my off soo much. I go onscene to syncope's all the time and you have no idea how often I come across that situation. You get a soccer mom who thinks that b/c she went to a cpr class that she knows what shes doing.  They are practically sitting on the person that just has this bewildered look on there faces.  I asked them is the person got combative when they woke up? Almost always the answer is no.  The same amount of energy you spent holding them down, you coulda spent helping them up nice and slow.  You didn't break the law or anything, you can freaking stand up.  Do that slowly and with help. If you can't, then maybe an ambulance is just what you need.        The under 18 thing, your kinda SOL.  We couldn't release you unless we talked to your parents, and if we couldn't, we would have to take you to the ER, if you refused, police would make you go.  It sucks, but thats the law.|`|gVejeg9maa	Well, unfortunately the EMT's were probably following what the law states.(In PA that I know for sure anyway)  Not positive but pretty sure most other states are the same, but by law anyone under the age of 18 may not legally refuse treatment for what(in all intents and purposes) was a legitimate 911 call.  Syncope, what you described, would be considered potentially serious.  And would require not just a word over a phone but actually signing the refusal of treatment.  Now this could be a kicker too!  If the EMT believes that the refusal of treatment would endanger the life of the minor they are well within there authority to contact what ever law enforcement has jurisdiction and have the minor treated anyway and generally charges of child welfare or child endangerment.  The touchy thing in doing that as an EMT is that if your wrong a law suit may follow.
cPQ7TBcuaa	Weed is illegal because it is too easy to grow, therefore the government couldn't tax it the way that they do cigarettes and alcohol.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	more money to be made in illegal trade of goods|`|UMg1CL7baa	Well heres my logic. Marijuana is illegal because when your high, you tend to look at things in perspective. You see things for what they really are. You start to question the way things are such as why things happen and how, not just this is it because it is. And one of the main things people tend to question is the govenrment. And the government doesnt want people questioning their athority. They want people to just do as they say. They want to be incontrol. they dont want to hear what the public has to say. Thats just my logic    also the government puts a tax on beer so they make money. Marijuana can be grown and they cant put a tax on it so they cant make money off it.    doesnt the government suck?|`|448c7a6cdc78d3a797b7c58c25d1ff56aa	Alcohol and tobacco lobbyists|`|AA11711276	Do an internet search on "Anslinger Hearst DuPont marijuana" for a real eye-opener.|`|ZzknHgU1aa	Why are opiates illegal? Why is hallucinogenic Nyquil available to children? Why can you buy Tylenol with codeine over the counter in Canada, but only by prescription in the US? Why is Qat legal in India but not in the US? Should chewing coca leaves be legalized but not smoking crack? Should beer be allowed at more than 12% alcohol?|`|0Dqg2Hj2aa	Well weed is no harder then tobacco to grow. So that's not really an issue. People are scared of change i guess. It could play a big roll in turning our ailing economy around, by providing cash thru tax and jobs thru the in-tire distribution and manufacturing of it.

Politics is a management of power, how you get it, and how you use it. So politician is in common word a silent solider that you called broker or Dalal. In the sufficient superior word for them is political manager. Political manager has very demandable in political parties; they manage all legal and illegal matter of parties. Whether the matter would be related to in the party or outside the party.     Political manger makes relation with other parties to his party that means they have been alliance with other parties for his political interest. Leaders have mass power but mass convert in vote it could manage by these political managers. Every political party has so many mass managers who perform his better role. In front of public they send a message of his party and give the massage to others party.     Currently party has more or less depends on this type of manager, because party has own voter who vote blindly, it does not matter where party perform better or not. Some management level part has been left by party system they will fulfill that problem. If you are very popular in mass that could not mean you get better vote in election.     So you would call him the polite man who never gets angry whatever you told them. He has always smiled in his face, whenever they get chance in his profit he will move on that side. So they are also a time manger, they know which time is better for him and they havent. Politics is a power play, so they have always in playing team, they dont want to play in defensive team. But some time his fortune never gets his support, and then they will go in back food and play defensively.     We cant name here any person or persons, because they are very reputed also known as very powerful guy. So it could not my manner to written his name by myself. But this politically powerful guy has very friendly in every party and today electronic media. Special news from inner the party has been leak by that person. They could create a strategy to whole drama and move the voting swing. So people know about this guy, they have useful for us!|`|f260fecd5ca5dc4eb4cded2d66649c61aa	Ghandi to the later question.

Why should someone whose job could be done by a semi-trained chimp be paid the same as someone whose job requires 4+ years of college and 30 years of experience?    Your theoretical society completely disregards human nature: that people are lazy, selfish, and greedy.    EDIT: So, in your theory, 1 person busting his ***, doing the job of 10 people is bad?

gdYN39gtaa	Yes, he lucked out getting a majority all around so all his wishes   would be okayed. This is the reason we absolutely need checks   and balances. Obama wants the stimulus package passed quickly   and I wonder why? Maybe if everyone had time to see where all   this money is going, they'd think twice as only 12% will stimulate   the economy and the rest (88%) is all pure pork. This is plain   nonsense.  We need all of it to go for stimulating the economy    since that is what this package is for, isn't it?

He's trying his best to work with Republicans in Congress, but that doesn't mean the policies he picks will garner your complete support.  Your best bet is to look over the policies, and hope that when they are passed they do good, even if you disagree with them in the first place.  That's the issue many people have with Rush Limbaugh is that he outright said that he wants them to fail, you don't seem like that kind of person from how you wrote your question.

gzuSxg5caa	No, not as it is currently written in House bill HR 1. HR 1 only extends the deadline for people to be eligible for starting Tier 2 of the extension bill passed in November '08. The bill will help extend benefits for anyone newly unemployed, or currently receiving benefits that would otherwise be exhausted before March 29, the previous deadline. The new deadline is in December; so the March date is no longer a cutoff.     But HR 1 is not law yet, it has to be combined with Senate proposals before it becomes law. So far I don't see any change in Senate info online that would change HR 1 for extensions for those who will exhaust their benefits completely around mid-April, even though this involves about half of all people on benefits right now!    If you think it should be different, this is the time to call your Senators, since they are debating and voting on their version of the bill in the coming days.    Don't be misled by the news summaries; you can read the actual bill online.

People believe the Soviet Union failed because Communism failed.  They'd be wrong on that assessment.  Communism probably would have taken them down eventually, but they still had a long while to go before it did.    What really took them down was war.  They had this idea that they should go around invading countries to try and turn them to the Soviet mindset.  And for a while, they were rather successful.    Then they came across Iraq and Afghanistan.  These two countries resisted considerably.  And though neither one was able to really fight off the Soviets, the Soviets were never able to crush the resistance of the people.      And the Soviets kept thinking they were so close, and kept going.  And they ran out of money, but they were so close, and so they borrowed some to keep going.  And they ran into debt, but they were so close, and so they borrowed more to keep going.  And still they were so close and so they borrowed still more to keep going.    And finally the countries they borrowed from didn't like that the Soviet Union wasn't paying them back, and demanded their money back.  And all of a sudden the Soviet Union realized that it was in huge debt and had no way to pay it back.  Then each of the component countries of the Soviet Union became afraid of the economic collapse, and so they each broke away in an attempt to escape the economic problems of the others.          Now doesn't that sound a little familiar?  Bush sent us into Iraq and Afghanistan; and though they have not really been able to fight against us, we have been unable to quell the resistance completely either.  But we are so close, and so we keep going.    And they resist, but we are so close, and so we borrow the money to keep going.  And they resist, but we are so close that we borrow more money to keep going.      You remember the next step?  That's right, economic collapse as other countries demand their money back.          If we are to stave this off, we have to leave both Iraq and Afghanistan.  Whether you believe they are justified or not, we simply cannot afford to keep going.  Then we have to raise taxes and actually pay those countries back, so that they don't collapse our economy when they become afraid we can't pay and come demanding their money back.    If we continue as we have for the past 6 years, we will collapse.  Not like the Roman Empire, but like the Soviet Empire.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	the united states will never fall to a forign force ,but it will rot from the core out wards,and the corruption in the core of our legal political anf financial system will bring it to its knees.people will rebel and change the way things are done on wal street and DC,the biggest carrier of coruption is lawyers,they have raised havoc through out the ages,rather they were called scribes or any other name.people who make excessivly large amounts of wealth with no work or product to sell are parasites to any nation or country.we have so many legal hacks willing to foul our political system and every other organisen of public trust its sickning.we need to punish evil doers and not let them controle the ship of state,they will beach the ship so they can plunder the cargo hold for them selves.let the passengers drown they dont care,just like samoli pirets they rob cheat lie and steal in a legal way|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	I wonder if you will read the answers to this question.

Especially since we have a 35% corporate tax rate (The highest of all industrialized nations).     The Republicans refused to vote for it because their Amendments, which were approved in committee, were not included in the final bill. The Dems may have pleaded for bipartisanship but were unwilling to make even one compromise. No wonder the Republicans voted against it.     To answer your question... Yes I believe, hope and pray that the Republicans will continue to oppose these Socialistic pieces of legislation.     If they wanted to make a fast/big difference in our declining jobs market they could easily cut the Corporate Tax Rate to 25% and companies would be climbing the fences to get back in and do business here.

i790R5DXaa	United States have turned from an independent manufacturing powerhouse and the world's leading creditor into a bankrupt nation with little manufacturing capacity left, dependent on other nations for the imports that maintain our unsustainable standard of living. The result is that the US has become the center of a system in which its number one job is to consume rather than produce.    Credit and liquidity isn't the real problem. The real problem is solvency. Not enough new money is coming into the US economy to cover the money going out. And as the Federal Reserve pumps out more fiat currency to prop up the banks, the worth of the dollar declines, which means that foreign lenders will not want to loan us any more money, and indeed are trying to get out of the US debt they already hold, because it does not matter how hard Americans work and are taxed if the government is making the dollars worthless.  Continuing the game of just shaking the money back and forth in the hopes that it will grow (or at the lest you can dump the debt on someone else) is not a formula for national prosperity.

We should be working on toning down the negativity surrounding the economy to boost consumer confidence so that people start to put their money back into the economy.     A reasonable stimulus package, sans pork barrel spending, would also help.  A stimulus package that helped create jobs without spending more money than those jobs would likely bring in would be a good thing.     Decreasing the taxes more at this point probably wouldn't help tremendously but increasing them ridiculously, to cover the costs of needless spending, isn't going to help either.  It may help in the short term but when tax season comes around and people are hit harder than usual it's just going to cause a nasty snowball effect.   The more money people keep in their own hands, the more they feel confident in putting into the economy.     That's something we don't want.   Keeping minimum wage low so that businesses can stay open and can keep their employees is also a good thing.

I stand firmly behind the execution of those who have earned it...    To those that talk of the "Christian ethic" of not believing in this punishment... I say... look no farther than the Book of Judges in   the Bible...  God Himself dealt out rules for the Judges to go by  that deals this punishment out to those that earn it ... under the law...    And, to those, like the responder Wartz... who so flippantly refers to   Texas as being (tongue in cheek)... "enlightened" on this subject... I might point out... that Texas has far fewer people that are brought up on Death Penalty cases ... because it is something once earned in this state... is carried out !   And, criminals KNOW this so there are far fewer doing crimes that carry that punishment....    One only has to be at a crime scene of one of these cases.... to see the barbaric results of what these animals are capable of... to know that they definitely deserve being "put down" for their actions...    My biggest problem with all of this ... is this ...unending appeals process that goes on for ever and ever and ever while lawyers soak the public trust in endless paperwork to find some loop hole to allow these fruit baskets a "walk".....  I am one that believes there should be a definite time limit and appeals limit .... then an execution !!  Period !!    And, when it comes to the outrageous expense involved in these cases... that comes from the judicial restraints placed on the law in getting one of these cases to finals.... brought on by all the bleeding hearts that have this unending care and humanity to show these mindless rabid apes  and the bureauacracy that has sprung up around this endless line item 'test' of every minute factor that has to be done in order to get it done....  Then.. the expense AFTER the trial...is by way of keeping these people in an extra layer of security...in a seperate circumstance with seperate guards and seperate situation that run the daily care of these maniacs into the tens of thousands of dollars more per year than a common inmate.... more of a case to execute them rapidly after due process !!    To those that have a problem with carrying out capital punishment I suggest that you stand clear of Texas ... because here... the death penalty is in force... and here... we are not in the least bit sqimish about ... carrying it out !!  Don't Mess With Texas     ? ////|`|JH2GqpA2aa	I'm afraid of death.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	I'm opposed to it because it only would work if murderers were capable of rational thought instead of being motivated by alcohol, drugs and testosterone.  It is about time that the United States joint the rest of the Western civilized nations and abolish it.    The death penalty may be a regular feature in the news but in real life, it isn't even a blip on the criminal radar screen and hasn't been significant part of the justice system for over a century. During the last 100 years, the most people executed in one year was 198 in 1935. There were 50 or so killed in 2007 and 37 in 2008 (half of those in the enlightened state of Texas.) This represents one execution for every 8 million people. For a nation of 300 million people this is statistically zero, absolutely insignificant when compared with the number of murders that happen.  There is much hoopla but little results.    If it was done away with entirely the savings could be spent in ways that prevent murders. Most of the expense is up front at the investigation and trial stage and serves only to let grandstanding prosecutors pander to the public by showing how tough they want us to think they are.     There may be a great amount of support for the death penalty including on this board but I don't think most people realize that it is a very glitzy package with nothing inside--a reality nothing.     In my state, California, there has been about one execution every three years since the death penalty was reinstated.  There are over 600 inmates on death row so at that rate it will take 1,800 years to kill them all provided we don't get any more.  The most common cause of death on death row is natural causes followed by suicide.  Lethal injection is a distant third.      The expense of keeping capital punishment on the books is absolutely enormous.  Prosecuting a death penalty case which is unlikely to result in an execution costs about three times what the same case would cost if death was off the table.  As an example, the state of Maryland figures it has spent $37 Million EACH for the executions it has carried out since reinstating the death penalty. When you look at the costs, this is a criminal waste of the public's money.     Like it or not, the death penatly is pretty pointless.|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	If one takes life he must see equal punishment.  The problem is that their are so many trials/appeals that it takes too long and they stay in prison for 10+ years.|`|4CsGde1qaa	I believe the death penalty is cruel to the max, but it doesn't mean its not fair. I personally believe the Death penalty is wrong by all means because killing is wrong and it involves taking away someone from living just because they did something wrong. Perhaps god should decide the fate of those that pass on, but some people claim that it may never happen. I don't know really, but still death penalty is bad and that is the end.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	i'm a liberal, but i'm for it.  to me, if someone is going to commit crimes that show they'll only have a negative impact on society as long as their around, then lose'em.  this applies to anyone who kills a child, or does a crime of the equivalent.|`|Zxtiewnyaa	i believe a eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth. If someone murders another person or persons, then they deserves everything they get, including roasting in the electric chair.I unfortunly live in a state that does not have the Death Penalty, it did but not no more. Instead you committ  a murder and you spend the rest of your wasted life behind bars living off of the TAXPAYERS and and cheating death. But as for the griefing family of the people that you murder, not only do they have to deal with their love ones who are now dead, but then they have to accept that their love one's murderer is " living a life" behind bars but they are alive.Crime in my state would be down if they ever decided to get off their high horses and bring the Death Penalty back. ASAP. I live in the State of Massachusetts.|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I've gone back and forth on this most of my life, and finally decided to look at the death penalty system in action.  A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.    The most disturbing thing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, cant guarantee we wont execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.    A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.    Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.     Other important facts:   Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty.     The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that dont.    There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.    The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?    Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.

It goes against Christianity but sometimes it seems like we need more of it....I don't know|`|JZMfUDylaa	im against it! two wrongs don't make a right! death is the easy way out life time in prison is the way to go|`|8Ml5DzJraa	totally disagree with death penalty!!! Our life and death is only in the hands of God no human should have any right to take that in their own hands. lifetime imprisonment is the best punishment instead!|`|NbVtYsr5aa	I used to believe the death penalty was fine, but my faith has led me to believe otherwise.  Our society pushes justice, which is fine, but do not fall into the trap that killing someone for something they did wrong is just.  Sure, these people's sins may be the most mortal, the most awful, but life should not be taken away from someone under any circumstances.  What's worse, being on death row for multiple years then dying, or living the rest of your years in prison?  I would say the second one.  The people who support this do not know the macabre that it actually is.  Filling someone with electricity isn't exactly the best sight to see.  As humans we are called to have compassion for everyone.  To forgive as Jesus Christ did and move on.  The death penalty is nothing more than a grudge against someone that takes away the only right thing the person has been given.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	It's a complicated issue...    But I decided that I'm against it.    Simply put, if we as a people put ONE innocent person to death, then we are ALL murderers. (The people Vs...)    I just cant live with that, not morally or ethically. And its been proven by the evidence that we have made mistakes... and still do.    Couple that with the numbers... Death penalty vs non death penalty shows no signifigant change in crime reduction. And surprisingly its more expensive to the taxpayer to put an inmate to death then it is to lock him up for life.    So what do we do it for? Revenge? No civilized society should legalize revenge. Hard labor and life without freedom in an 8 x10 cell is enough punishment for a human being to mete out.    Dont get me wrong though... if some sicko hurt someone I cared about? My Fiance? My Family? I'd kill the bastard myself and wouldnt care about the consequences.   I just dont expect it to be the law of the land.|`|o1pXRFtUaa	the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. I have taken many classes where we discuss how horrible it is to have the death penalty. We are the only westernized country to have it... mostly all other countries have abolished it... even Germany has a law that states that prisoners cannot even be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole because that would be cruel. think about it this way: The death penalty is meant to do only one thing.... deter other criminals from committing crimes. Killing a human being to "set an example" is not only wrong but it diminishes the worth of human life. Sociologists have done many studies about deterance and found that frankly, it doesn't work!  if you want, google 'deterance theory" and you will see that criminals don't think about if they are going to prison or not before committing a crime... so "setting an example" does not work, nor will it ever work. One last thing to mention is that the death penalty costs much much much more than sentencing someone to life in prison. That doesn't seem like it would be the case, but it has been proven and you can look that fact up also. OHH and lastly, look up the % of people who are found guilty and then months or years later are found to be innocent! It's in the 20%'s! The death penalty is just plain barbaric and stupid- it makes no sense!|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	I think it might be fine if we had a fair and reasonable justice system that 1) did not convict innocent people and 2) looked at the base causes for criminal actions (i.e., considered poverty, parental abuse, biological factors, etc.).  Since our justice system will never meet either of these criteria, the death penalty is unaccaptable.

fB6S8G2kaa	That's the way politics works.  The only way to get pork projects passed is to hide them in larger legislation.  They are put there so the representatives/senators can become reelected.  If they pass a bill that includes lots of money for people in their districts, they have a better chance of getting reelected.  Unethical?  Yes.  But that's the way it works in this country.|`|6nS62bB8aa	The stimulus package is not intended for the American taxpayers.    At all.    The whole thing is actually just the most recent grab by the government. Grabbing cash and control. That is all.    No republicans contributed to the package because non were ALLOWED to contribute. It is a purely Democrat boondoggle, a scam to rake in a trillion dollars for themselves and cronies.

vKR4tysjaa	No offesne, but dems have been throwing money at problems for years, and accomplishing NOTHING.  Look at the cities and states where Dems have been in power (UNCHALLENGED) for thiry plus years.  They get ALL their policies passed, unchecked by repubs, for there aren't any, and those cities (States) are complete third world ward areas.  Detroit, Philidelphia, etc, etc.      The dems have been in TOTAL control of detroit for over thirty years, and have been able to pass every policy they wanted.  They have tossed money at Labor Unions, education, teachers, poor, etc, etc, and the city is far worse off for it.  Dems seem to reward failure.    Lately, repubs have bought into this way of thinking too, throwing money at Libs to quiet them down.  It too is a total failure.  They've strategically put it to great use, empowered themselves, and successfully blamed all the countries probs on greedy white repubs.    I'm guessing that the rest of the country will resemble the state of Michigan in the next ten to 15 years if dems go unchallenged in the Whitehouse & Congress.

Xk2nBM8raa	If you landlord told you he/she would do it, then it's their responsibility. If they didn't tell you, then it is your own. Check your landlord statement and see if anything was written about snow removal. There isn't too much that I know of you could do other than contacting him/her and asking if they are supposed to be taking care of the snow, and if they would. But legally, I don't think there is anything you can do. Just call and ask if they would mind clearing you out when you get a big snowfall. It would show them that you don't need them every time a snowflake fell too.Good Luck.|`|EvlPzrVOaa	check with city hall they will tell you the exact city ordinance.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	I don't think it's illegal.

If so, there is an implicit obligation of the landlord to maintain the driveway for your access to that service (off-street parking, garage, etc), and you could (in theory) have a claim for a rebate for those days on which you were not able to use the services you're paying for.    Of course, you can also be evicted as a "trouble-maker", so you might have to come up with a nice way to get the landlord to notice this is a problem.

PjzJ9QQRaa	I would just plead guilty.  You will have to pay the fine no matter what, because courts will usually not overrule an officer who has you clocked-whether or not it is true or accurate.    By pleading no contest and trying to explain yourself, you will look like you are making excuses and that will annoy them.  Just own up, apologize and pay the fine.      You never know, they may go easy on you.  Especially if you just admit you were wrong.|`|7Jsibcnpaa	You can go ahead and plead it out as guilty and just pay it...the only thing that pleading "no contest" is going to get....in the long run...is more time for you to pay the fine.  If all you have is a speeding ticket...then that's the only thing you are being charged with.  You can also look up your municipal court for your city and it should give you some idea on how much the fine is going to be.....don't forget....they will add court costs in it as well.  I wish you the best of luck....and slow down...life is wonderful......slow down and enjoy it!|`|7kPvV8EXaa	I would ask for a continuance and go get your truck calibrated.  If it is off by a couple of miles it may drop it from reckless to speeding.     Read the ticket, it will tell you what you are charged with.      Nolo or guilty are pretty much the same thing unless there was an accident involved.  Doesn't sound like there was, so it won't make much difference.  You could plead nollo contendre.|`|EvlPzrVOaa	what i would do is do some research on the speed radar, doppler. basically the new radars are run by the doppler satellite. main use was opposite direction in a 2 lane road. also the road has to be flat, and did the officer calibrate it that day, it does not make any calculation in a 4 lane rd. lets say you were in the otside lane an he was in the opposite oncoming inside. then there is no way to make a accurate reading. if there was a hill or slope there is no way for it to make a adjustment according. read more into it an when court comes dress professionally an talk clear concise and tell them your finding or if a chance ask the officer questions. not likely tho. take pictures of the site where you think he sued the radar on you. better chance if it was slope, 4 lane an such. then since you are in the know the judge amy dismiss the case.  do not argue or make a scene with your info. state the facts answer all questions. if you dont remember or dont wanna answer a certain ? then say to the best of my knowledge i dont recall that..sorry i was in a hurry

Not one Republian voted for it    and rightly so as 88% of it is pork and only 12% will stimulate    the economy. Now it goes to the Senate, and the Democrats    will also pass it.

L7BSLB6faa	Thanks for all who have posted that believing in the right to choose is quite different from "promoting abortions."  I think anyone would be hard pressed to find ANYONE who is "pro-abortion."  But the reality is that as a medical procedure it needs to be available and safe.  With education and resources properly applied the number of unwanted pregnancies can be reduced, but they will never be entirely eliminated.      How about some of the pro-life energy be spent on eradicating poverty and improving education.  That will help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and therefore the number of abortions.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Oh yes.  That is certainly their first priority.    Just because someone is pro-choice does not mean they promote abortions.  I am pro-choice, but would not have an abortion if at all possible.  But, I believe that I should be able to have the option.  If you don't like abortions, don't get one.  The government was never intended to legislate religious law.|`|T644csEIaa	no...|`|qDuXqxlKaa	Why?    There are a lot of misunderstandings between people who perceive themselves as "pro-life" or "pro-choice," but I've noticed that this is a particularly common form of misunderstanding on the pro-life side.     Just because a person is in favor of the legality of the medical procedure of abortion does NOT mean he or she likes abortion, or wants people to get abortions. I'm pro-life, and I realize this. It's not that hard.    If you can't understand why people who disagree with you actually disagree with you--their actual thought process, as opposed to your caricature of them as abortion-mongering monkeys who want to kill babies--all you're doing is preaching to the choir and making yourself look foolish.|`|4GhGPecEaa	They're pro-choice not pro-abortion.|`|FLWtpMrEaa	I can see it now.  BO on TV saying "Hello, I'm President Obama and I want to talk to you about abortion.  Abortions are good things.  Young people should not be punished with children.  So, if you decide to go out whoring around and wind up pregnant, don't worry.  The government will help.  We'll let you go to the doctor and let him yank that baby out and jab a pair of scissors in the back of its head and suck its brains out. We'll pay for it.  And if you decide to have an abortion later that normally allowed, the doctor can go ahead and do it and stick the baby in the morgue to die.  We'll pay for that too.  I'm President Obama and I approve this message."|`|ieiAdMtBaa	No, just because they are pro-choice doesn't mean they would advertise abortions.    I'm pro-choice, and I know I could never have an abortion but I would 100% support someone if they decided to have one.

It's the entire stimulus and the proposed affect that is the most important piece of the pie so to speak.

Your item listed   3 things that are made here...led me to wondering what is left that is actually made in America.  I found two interesting sites.

It is absolutely insane,   Nancy Pelosi is the worst thing that could ever happen to California and the world along with Obama:    The word is out about the $825 billion "economic recovery" package. $200 million for lawn care in Washington, D.C., $360 million to potentially be used to put on transsexual beauty pageants and erotic art shows. These are a few examples in the $825 BILLION (and counting!), over 1,588 page stimulus bill. Nancy Pelosi argues this bill would stimulate the economy, however only 7 percent of the legislation actually goes towards infrastructure - the rest of the bill reads like a taxpayer funded payoff to groups that have supported liberal interests.      And what a pay off! ACORN, the long controversial group that purposefully tried to muck up last year's elections to benefit the liberals is being rewarded by Pelosi with potentially $4.19 BILLION in taxpayer funds. And more than 10 percent of the proposal-$87 billion-would be directed to groups like Planned Parenthood!     What a scheme!    The country's recession is crippling families, and their solution is spending billions of dollars on contraception?|`|OlcC4hwcaa	every bill has pork in it, i don't know why we allow this. i got a great idea. lets do away with NAFTA and give tax incentives to companies like black and decker to close up shop in china and come back to the united states to make their cheap drills and grinders and give us our manufacturing jobs back|`|wULUGKzVaa	Nope, didn't know that.    So, efficiency isn't a criteria? Is that Obama logic?    For example, AmTrak hasn't recorded a profit for 40+ years, yet we'll be giving them $1 billion with this stimulus bill. What sense does that make?     I get it now, let's throw money at something that's inefficient and that will in turn stimulate the economy. Good God, I see now how Barry got elected.
mgVrAqpkaa	because people are scared of change- what is unknown in a lifetime can sometimes be scary. so a rich person has to sacrifice the extra Bentley to pay a slight tax increase while the poverty stricken mother who works two min wage jobs can feed her kids more then ramen and pbj (and that is very common). what has been going on is not working- time to try something else- do i think the bottom up will work- capital YES!|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Nope, but WW2 did stimulate the economy perfectly.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	You really need to do some research.

Employment was created by WW2, thats what happens when you draft all non working males into the military..... Other than that war production has nothing to do with normal production. Hitler for example destroyed germanys production capabilities by converting it all to military production, leaving no room or civilian production. Forceful theft, and then spending by government is not the same as citizen and entrepreneur created supply and demand. One lasts, the other cannot, no matter the temporary gains.    Look at the 1920-1921 depression. It was short, because there was barely ANY govenrment intervention. The depressions before that were SHORTER!      The current crisis is because of govenrment spending. They spend trillions on programs we cant even name, and they attempt to cut taxes which only adds more to the national debt. The fed releases cheap money below market rates, and combined with govt interventionist policy, create major distortions in the market. The housing market is a symptom of this.    $12,000,000 Million or so in national debt  $4,000,000 Million annual federal spending  $3,000,000 Million annual state and local spending  $1,000,000 Million banker bailout  $1,000,000 Obama 'stimulus plan  140 Million working americans to pay for it all.......Heart breaking numbers seeing the productivity stolen from the citizens, the stolen marketplace potential of that money....    That is debt created by politicians and their interests, not the citizens and their interests. They inflate the currency to pay for it, because they cannot tax for it all, they cannot even tax for a fraction of it.|`|3YfYWpAsaa	cuz u leave out this simple fact:  The last time a president raised taxes in a recession (yes, it was FDR) we got the great depression.

WWII got us out of the Great Depression? Try again. WWII created the necessary conditions, but what got us out of the Depression was apparently an incredibly high tax rate and increased government spending. Sure, those things were for the war effort (BUY WAR BONDS posters probably helped too), but simply saying "WWII ended the Great Depression" skips a few steps. They did happen in sequence though, so it can be deceptive if you didn't listen in high school.    So the argument today goes, "FDR didn't end the Great Depression, WWII did." Which is silly, because FDR was the President during WWII. He was president for the whole Depression and then some, but we're supposed to believe that he had nothing to do with ending it. So who did, then? Should we thank Hitler for saving our economy by invading Poland? We couldn't have had WWII without him, you know.

You didn't watch IceRoad Truckers last year did you???  Well they are in Canada and were trucking near ANWAR, and drilling on the Canadian side (and found natural gas I might add) and they were always talking about how many polar bears there were and how dangerous they are.)    Also, animals are suppose to change and adapt, if not we'd still be living in caves.      AND I can't remember the species, but there was an ocean species along the west coast that environmentalists were trying to save, in that process they killed off another type of underwater creature, why??  Because the species they were trying to save ate the other one that was killed off.  And what happened when their food source was gone???  The species they were trying to save moved further north up the coast, totally changing the ecosystem on the west coast.  So they had to limit how much they helped the original species or else the whole underwater world would end.|`|dgyYTKe5aa	You know what's scary?

Check it out, we have the HIGHEST corporate tax structure in the world.  Even Germany realized that wasn't a good move and lowered taxes.    This may come as a surprise to a lot of Democrats but, publicly traded companies are not there to give you a job.  Sounds strange to you I know but, the facts are the facts.  You so much as begin to announce tax hikes on corporations and guess what, that CFO, CIO start looking to chop heads.    Why?  Simple, your top line usually can only go so far so what's left?  The OPEX/Bottom line.  Which, roughly translated, is expenses.  The largest is usually labor.      So, if you are a corporate executive, and you get railed by Wall Street every Quarter and you want to keep  YOUR job, what do/would you do?  You got it, whack away.    Say goodbye to that guy on the loading dock with a bad attitude, dump that secretary who always has illnesses when you can least afford her to.      It's usually not hard, look at AT&T.  They whacked, yet another 12,000 jobs and guess what, the company didn't skip a beat.      If you think tax credits don't (usually) create jobs you are either living in a fantasy, are a democrat through and through, and definitely have absolutely no fundamental grasp of business.    To be sure, some will take the quick profits along with their corporate parachute and say addios!  Look at hacksaw Reynolds, he wasted Sunbeam on his way out the door to retire in Boca.  There's always "that" guy....but hey, if I am wrong, what do you think the corporations are going to do if you even go near that tax structure....    You ***** about Bush.  Fine, you have that right but keep in mind, the Fiscal budget for 09 will be more than 3X what Bush spent in 08. FACT, not fiction.  And yet, you just don't seem to get it.  You thought BUSH spent money...whoa!  Pelosi and the rest of the yak's never saw a buck they didn't like    Check out where they intend to spend YOUR money.....50 million for the Endowment of the Arts, and you thought Bush was out of touch???  People, mostly democrats, are getting whacked wholesale and you want that dearly beloved new President to spend....more?    It's the ultimate in cynical.  They want you down and out so far that your only hope is the heir apparents.  Well, I have lived long enough to recognize a duck when I see it.      If you think spending over 850 billion (2/3 of which are simply stupid handouts that will do absolutely NOTHING to stimulate the economy) will get things on track you are a complete idiot.

711R4J6saa	Yes it does. The popular vote in each state determines where that state's electoral vote goes.      http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepolitic...|`|Alkn6IJYaa	The popular vote does not matter in the sense that it is not the official count of who wins the election. For example, the official records show that Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000, but that George Bush won the electoral vote.    However, the two totals are very close, and the Newspapers who researched the Florida vote in 2000 claim that had all votes be re-counted in the state of Florida, Al Gore also would have won the electoral vote. But that is another story that you should trust nobody with!    The difference in the popular vote and the electoral vote is that small states get a certain amount of electors despite their size. So the electoral college is slightly biased towards small states.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yes the popular votes matter because the vast majority of the time the electoral college casts their votes based on the majority vote for their state.    Example, Ohio has 20 electoral college votes.  This year Ohio's popular vote went to Barack Obama.  So, the electoral college in Ohio cast their 20 votes for Barack Obama.   Had the majority vote been for McCain, they would've cast their 20 votes for McCain.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	Does it matter in terms of who gets elected?  No    But it does matter in terms of political pull, getting things done.|`|MGEYaehVaa	Nationwide:  No, not really.  But in individual states, yes it does.    Each state is given a set number of electoral votes.  Whichever candidate wins the popular vote for a particular state also wins ALL of that state's electoral votes.  So yes, the popular vote does matter, in a way.    There have been some instances (Gore vs Bush) where the winner of the national popular vote does not win the election.  However, this is very uncommon.|`|cIPziIdnaa	Yes, because whoever wins the popular vote in each state also wins that entire state's slate of electors (except in Nebraska and Maine, where it is proportional).|`|yjDM4Mzfaa	Yes, it most certainly does!  The candidate who has the majority of popular votes in a state is awarded all of a state's electoral votes.  Unfortunately, that's how George W. Bush "won" the 2000 presidential election and started the first of his two terms and his eight year debacle; but in this particular case it took the Supreme Court to decide who received Florida's contested electoral votes unfairly without recounting all of the popular vote!  It surely didn't hurt that Bush's brother Jeb was Florida's governor at the time and the majority of the Supreme Court leaned to the conservative Republican right!  Reform of the electoral college system could prevent such a mishap from recurring, but it would take a constitutional amendment which is highly unlikely and nevertheless would not stop partisan politics always in play!|`|3f038aed8a7f1bb8dc70f0fd44baa27eaa	It is through the popular vote that the electoral college votes for the president.  Each state has electors who will vote based on the popular vote of their state.   In the past, the electors  would go to cast their votes for their states. now adays the popular vote would have more meaning because we are so more in contact with each other then in the past.|`|Xn0Lh8T3aa	Only within the confines of each state's borders.    A state's "popular vote" determines who wins the state.    The President must win support of states.    270 would generally result from winning the most states and thus the most "popularity contests".    Edit: The Electoral College is biased toward the bigger states, not the smallest.    In 1787, the biggest state was only 7 times bigger than the smallest. Today the biggest is over 70 times bigger than the smallest. It takes a lot of small states to equal the biggest in the Electoral College.    Technically, enough Electoral votes exist to elect a president on the outcome of only 11 states out of 50. It's just not very likely that those 11 would form a coalition as they are very diverse in political ideals. Mathmatically possible but politically improbable. I live in one of the 11, but we more often side with the smaller states.|`|A1mln67Aaa	Yes, the popular vote matters.    In most states (I think 48 of 50), the delegates to the electoral college must cast their vote according to the popular vote for their state.    The number of delegates from each state is equal to the number of members of congress plus two senators.   So for example, my state has 15 congressional district plus 2 senators, to equal 17 delegates to the electoral college.   For all 50 states, there are 435 members of congress and 100 senators plus 3 votes for Washington D.C. (not a state but given 3 votes by the 23th amendment) for a total of 538 possible electoral votes.    538 / 2= 269.    269 + 1 = win    Now it is possible for a tie to occur or for a majority electoral vote to give the presidency to someone who did not win the popular vote.   This does not occur often, but every time it does, it raises the same question you have.    Why?    The reasons go all the way back to the founding of the country and the theorys and arguments over the same issue more than 200 years ago.     The same questions were raised and the answer was the electoral college vote.     The basic problem is that without the electoral college, the big states would always dominate American politics and small states would not have a voice.    The presidency could be determined by just a handful of the most populous states.   The electoral college system is a compromise system that works.    It's not perfect, but the alternatives are worse.    In the words of Winston Churchill, former Prime Minister of England, "Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried."|`|AA10015960	1. What are the two major processes used to select delegates to national conventions?    a. Presidential Primaries- a presidential primary is an election in which  parties voters choose some or all of a state party organizations delegates to their parties national convention or express a preference among various contenders for their presidential nomination. This is a voting system that allows party members to vote for a certain candidate where the percentage that is won by the candidates will be sent to the national convention to represent that candidate.  b. Caucus Convention- This process is the oldest process that has a local caucus meeting. At this caucus the party members split up into different group representing the candidate that they support. Then party members try to persuade each other to come over to their candidate's side and support them. Then a count is done of the amount of party members support each candidate. Depending on the percentage of party members each candidate receives that is how many delegates are sent up to the state convention. Then from that convention delegates are chosen to go to the national convention.    2. How does proportional representation differ from the winner take all system?    Winner take all is a contest where the candidate who won the preference vote automatically won the support of all delegates chosen at the primary. Recently this type of voting has disappeared and is now not in use anymore.  Proportional representation is any candidate who wins at least fifteen percent of the votes cast. Of the votes that are cast in a primary, the number of that states Democratic convention delegates that correspond to his or her share of that primary vote. For instance if a state has one hundred delegates and a candidate wins sixty percent of the primary vote, that candidate gets sixty candidates to go to the    3. Why are hard fought presidential primaries fairly common in the party out of power and rare for the Presidents party?    When the party who is in power is doing all of the work the other party tries to show every weakness in that party so that for the next election that party will get more votes. The primary for the presidential candidate that is not in power is fought harder because the people by that point want change in the government. They want fresh faces with new ideas that will help move our society forward.    4. Expressing Problems Clearly- As you read some critics of the current primary system favor a series of regional primaries held at two or three week intervals. What might be the advantages and disadvantages of such a system?    By spreading out the primaries to regional areas at two or three week periods you are allowing the candidates more time to get their ideas and thoughts out to as many people in those areas that they can before they vote. The down side to this is that it can make some regions less important then others when it comes to the voting process. By spreading out the times in which certain regions vote you are giving the first states more power over voting because they can set the pace or tone of the primaries. Also if a certain candidate gets enough votes by the other regions then there is no reason for the voter regions to vote.    1. How does the way the Electoral College functions today differ from the Framers intentions?    As the people vote in the presidential election they do not cast a vote directly for one of the contenders for the presidency. Instead they vote to elect presidential electors. The constitution provides for the election of the President by the Electoral College, in hitch each State has as many electors as it has members of congress. The framers expected the electors to use their own judgment in selecting a President. But unlike what the framers had in mind the electors are expected to vote automatically for their party's candidates for President and Vice President.    2. What are the three main weaknesses of the Electoral College system?    a. There is always the chance that the popular vote will not win the presidency. This problem is due to two main factors the bigger of the two is the winner takes all feature of the Electoral College system. That is the winning candidate customarily receives all of the states electoral votes. The other majo0r problem is the way the electoral votes are distributed among the states. Since each state is allotted two slots in the electoral process and not by the states population that means that the smaller states with less of a population have just as much power as big states with a huge population.  b. Nothing in the constitution nor in any federal statue requires the electors to vote for the candidate favored by the popular vote in their States. The electors are expected to vote for the candidate who carries their state and as loyal members of their parties but this is not always the case. Only on nine occasions have electors cast their vote for another candidate or no at

The founding fathers, even though they may have been predominantly of Christan faiths, nevertheless seems to have understood the above very well and did not make the Christian faith the law of the land.  Thank God!    Remember people, making Christianity the official religion, or making it part of our government, makes it part of the law of our land.

There are undeclared nuclear powers; for example, it's widely assumed that Israel has nuclear weapons, but it has never confirmed nor denied this.    If a nation has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and they did not have nuclear weapons at the time they signed the treaty, then the other signatories are obligated by treaty to attempt to stop them from getting nuclear weapons.

I will think of how Bush in 2004 tried to re-regulate the GSA's only to be rebuffed by the demcratic controlled banking committee.  I will think o the 4% unemployment we had under Bush.  I will think of the 2 billion dollars going to ACCORN to get more illegal voters on the ranks, and the Unions who will bleed business and kill more companies like they did to Steel, Car Companies, Shipping Comanies, even newspaper printers.  I will think of a man who established a democracy right next to Iran who has vowed to destroy Isreal and America while the use Obama as a pawn to get there way.

One of the answers above show's the complacency of the average moron involved strictly on a we win ..you lose political mentality.  They do'nt seem to realize that the more corruption that exists and that you get use to, the more there will be, and one day that corruption might come back to bite them in the butt.  Since when did we start tolerating corruption ? Why are we tolerating the existance and intwinement in our politicians that are suppose to be representing us ?  It doesn't matter how you slice it up....democrat, liberal, republican..conservative..whatever.... The fact is, the system should be pristine, it should be able to be relied on and not "played".  So if the system fails, it fails all of us, Acorn or any other organization should be eliminated if corruption is all they can accomplish or their whole existence.  What we need is to commission people that are honest and unbiased. People that understand what the founders wanted for this country and identify who our enemies are. After that, then we apply the standard to people and groups..and then we can hang those groups.  In the 60's along with civil defense, we were taught to look for communism, we were told why it doesn't work and why it isn't acceptable in America. Now they seem to stand shoulder to shoulder with the liberal and socialist in an overt manner to change what America is all about.

The Democrats are famous for it.  As bad and corrupt as this group is, the government is earmarking billion for these crooks.      Their job is to get the votes, legal or otherwise.  What's funny now is that they don't even care if you know.  The Dem's are in power and they know it.   What are you going to do to them.  It's absolutely hilarious.      I recommend we start cheating as well.  Look whats going on in Minnesota with Al Franken.  More votes than there were registered voters in certain districts, the Illinois Governor and his crooked deal(s) (I still think the White House Chief of Staff was involved, he was conspicously absent during the bru hah hah and this is coming from a guy who PUBLICLY said, the Republicans can go f themselves.).    Democrats are loud, they love to hate.  No problem, don't get mad, get even.  Whack as many of them as you can at work.  If you have a chance to lay one off, DO IT...they would do it to you if they could.  Don't get angry get even.  It's the best medicine.    They are the ones that hung a sitting Governor in effigy.  Can you even begin to imagine what would have happened if anyone on the right did that to Obama's image?  You would be in jail.  Ironic, isn't it.  They are all for free speech until they hear something they don't like.    They want groups like ACORN to do the dirty work of politics.  After all, why take a chance on votes when you can fix them.      Well, if you have a cash business, cheat like hell on your taxes.  Why give it to these clowns?  Keep it and smile.  Give less to charities, afterall, Barack has the answers, let them feel the pressure....(by the way, Republicans historically give more to charities than democrats, fact, not fiction).      Hey, they won, sit back, watch them put in the ditch but whatever you do, do what you can.  Watch where you spend your money, use reverse leverage.     I'm okay with it, nothing I can do but, when given a chance, you can bet I will...quietly, effectively and with all the hatred the Democrats have shown over the years.    Don't forget, they won by 4 million votes...that's not really that much....we aren't so far behind as they might think...heh...heh...heh...    Hey Pearl, I hear what you are saying, the stopped by my house too, we put on a few robes and sheets, hung a few, took pot shots at a few more, beat their kids, and drank budweiser all day....it was a real hoot.....should have seen the others running down the street on fire....eeeehaww....wow, never heard the n word so much since Chris Rock on late night...well, weeee beee finin' to get our drink on and our ignant on and light up dem pipes we found on dem dark ones....

I also hope that a better eye is kept on this than it was when the first stimulus package was passed. I believe that if nothing is done things will only get worse. I know that the Republicans disagree and think that instead of a stimulus package, that we should cut out some of the tax paid programs. The only problem with that is, it seems that the lower income people get hurt the most, while the fat cats in Washington continue to line their pockets. If the Republican congressmen are really serious about wanting to help. They should start by giving themselves a reduction in salary. But this never seem to happen.

The government needs to let his economy run its course and just get out.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I used to work in a hospital & watched people come in & have their life saved. That is what this stimulus package is about. We are bleeding to death. You have to see the country as a big picture. You can use the human body as a metaphor. Blood is our life & if we stop it in an area such as the feet (ask a diabetic with about this) if the circulation is cut off the feet die eventually the person can't stand, support or hold up anything. Anyway, to think this is going to make things worst is not being realistic. Things are going to get worst with or without it. But this can atleast save us or parts of us or alteast make things better. If a diabetic just lets themself go they will lose their vision, kidney function, etc. Act like each area represents an area Banking, construction. The more we let area area get destroyed the faster the rest will go until we die. A diabetic can increase their blood flow. They might never return to what they were like before they had diabetes type 2 yet maybe they will if they take care of themselves they could end up better as they get older & compare themselves to their aging friends who eat sugar, etc. But no diabetic counts on that when they take care they just want to keep their vision & kidneys & legs, etc.|`|cIPziIdnaa	I think we are heading into a period of very high unemployment, coupled with high inflation.... yes I think the stimulus package will make things worse.|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	I don't see how it could possibly help.

Have a great 2009.
Mhm3J5g0aa	On a guess, based on my electronics background, i'd say that its a space constraint. You can't place components that generate heat too close together without designing someone that runs hot, and in that case you will have to come up with some kind of cooling system for the microchip. But eventually, you will end up being restrained eventually because the cooling just won' t be practical for use of such a chip other than specialized systems...like military, space, etc.  Reliablity will always rule over miniaturization.

They want all the benefits of a government, but they don't want to pay for any of them.    I say let's allow them to not pay taxes anymore.  But then bar them from the benefits of those taxes.  Benefits such as law enforcement and the court system, the military and the highways.  We can prevent them from using anything that is subsidised too, such local roads, schools, colleges, and universities, as well as the use of our currency.    I'll bet they'd be whining to go back to the good ole days of taxation.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I'll tell you what, if you don't want to keep the money you worked for (I'm taking a large leap here by assuming you work at all) then you can send your entire check to the government and let at least one of the rest of us keep our own money to spend how we see fit.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	*sigh*|`|otYOxmnuaa	It's more of a "playing the victim" act than a handshake.

Ill give you a real life example of your fake conversation.  So I was talking to my friend the other day.  He runs a forging business.  If his taxes go down 5%, he can hire five more workers, or invest an extra half million in a german made Lasco forging hammer.  But if his margins go down 5%, a quarter of his contracts are now not worth bothering with.    So while a tax cut means he can not only hire more people but be able to do more jobs, an tax raise means he can do fewer jobs and hire fewer people.     So what, you say, his taxes will go to the government, who will hire someone on their own.  WRONG, his business goes to china.    Yes, a tax cut would make me feel better.  I pay 60% of what I earn in taxes.  i dont have a new car, I dont even have new shoes.

JDltTREfaa	I was a criminology/sociology major.  During and immediately after college, I interned with the Department of Social and Health Services and I worked in juvenile corrections.    Neither job really appealed to me as a long-term career, but it sounds as though a career in juvenile corrections, juvenile probation, etc. might be something you'd like to focus on.    I went to law school.  Though I do not practice in those areas, there are many legal specialties that help children and families.  I also volunteer as a Court Appointed Special Advocate for abused and neglected children (which you do NOT need to be a lawyer to do).  Essentially, I am assigned to children who have been taken from their families.  I conduct an investigation into their lives/why they were removed, etc. and I prepare a written report for the Court about my findings and my recommendations.    I'd suggest that when you are in college you try to get an internship position in juvenile corrections or probation so you can see for yourself if this is a career field you'd like to pursue.    I don't want to rain on your parade or discourage you in any way but I did want to tell you that I worked with both juvenile and adult offenders for several years.  A hard lesson that I had to learn was that you cannot rehabilitate someone who does not want to be rehabilitated.  You can't fix someone who won't be fixed.  You will see teens who are smart and have SO much potential but who are so self-destructive and apathetic about their lives that they will flush their futures right down the toilet.  It'll break your heart and you'll have to be incredibly strong to do this kind of work . . . but if you are this strong I wish you all the luck in the world because this kids need an advocate!|`|QTQTdPO1aa	Child psychologist  Criminologist  Youth parole officer  There's more, but I can't think right now.

ao78cPPtaa	Many people say that it is unreasonable to expect that congressmen (or any other government official) should be experts in the myriad fields in which they legislate (or judge, administer, execute, etcetera), or that they should be virtuous enough to eschew corruption. However, I disagree. I find it incredibly hard to believe that, in a nation of slightly more than 300 million people, we can't produce 535 (just the congress) polymaths of integrity who are above corruption.        In conclusion, the acceptance of corruption is not necessary for an efficient government, but it is necessary for the [insert caustic yet truthful adjective, such as "fraud" or "embezzler," here] to able to continue ruling our country.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Depends on your definition of corruption.  In my view, government is corruption.  All governments, regardless of how capitalistic, socialistic authoritarian or libertarian they may be, all do two things:    1. they all use coercion to take from their captive populations  2. they all distribute what they took to those who are in control.    You can always tell who's in control of any government simply by determining who is benefiting the most.  They are not necessarily those who seem to be in the highest positions.  Follow the money, and you will always find the real power in any government.    In America, that would be the wealthiest 1%.    As proof of my assertion, I ask a few simple questions:  1. what would happen if you decided you no longer wanted to renounce your citizenship, but also choose not to move away?  Their reaction proves that we are all captives.    2. What would happen if you decided not to pay your taxes?  Would your govt. use force or the threat of force to take it from you? (arrest and imprisonment is force)    3. Who benefits most from your government and why?  Is the whole system arranged to their benefit?  Do you think that's just coincidence?|`|bXn6WGaXaa	I am of two minds on the subject.     The first is that it is the responsibility of the electorate to hold their officials to a higher standard and to demand fairness and transparency not only in government, but in campaigns as well. We need to hold these people accountable for every penny that comes into their possession, and what the cost of their being elected is to us. What deals were made to pay for their position? Where have our tax dollars been pledged? The government can't be left answerable only to themselves.    My second thought is a bit different. I have been reading Steven Pressfield lately. If you are not familiar with him, he is the author of "The Legend of Bagger Vance" and a number of books about Ancient Greece, specifically the Spartans, Alkibiades, and Alexander. He is definitely worth a read, but back to my point. The Spartans raised their sons for war. They had a specific upbringing, which all Spartan boys would enter at the age of seven. They got all of the training and discipline one would associate with creating professional soldiers, but one part seems appropriate in this forum. The boys were expected to steal food. They were fed just enough to make sure that they were always hungry, and expected to steal to supplement. While the theft was expected, being caught was disgraceful and grounds for being beaten. This was apparently done to teach the boys resourcefulness. The Spartans knew that the lives they led were likely to lead their sons into situations where they would have to resort to that kind of thing. Perhaps we are looking at this the wrong way. Maybe we should realize that we need leaders with a certain amount of resourcefulness and not dig too deeply into minor transgressions or expect a group of choirboys.     One of the points I disagree with Obama on is his appointment of Leon Panetta to head the CIA. I feel Panetta lacks experience in intelligence and military affairs, but the thing that really bothers me is that he seems like a nice guy. I want the head of the CIA to be the antithesis of that. I want a guy who gives his enemies sleepless nights and makes his allies sleep with one eye open. Do I care if he's corrupt? Not as long as the monster is my monster.
TJpQZju2aa	Most Americans arent listening. The most encouraging thing Ive heard lately is Mr. Obamas reported response to Republican objections to a spending-oriented economic plan: I won. Indeed he did  and he should disregard the huffing and puffing of those who lost.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	no president can please us all , but they can screw us all.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Well the last 8 years has trained a lot of people in attacking ideas.|`|DgmlkNsIaa	if he can't stand the heat he should get out of the kitchen (Harry Truman)|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Mr.O wanted and begged and fought to get on the HOT SEAT Get Over It.|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	neither.  its a use of the truth.  marxism as in obamas case must be called what it is a cancer and dealt with accordingly|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Your question brought to mind the vulgar reception that George Bush received just minutes before the inauguration of The Messiah.

Whoa-now!  It's your kind that attacks, has been attacking and then cries ACLU when you don't get your way.        Why is the country the way it is?  Greed.  People who want something for nothing.  Plane and simple.      Who is the most greedy?  Democrats.
7mOfekBWaa	lol expect nothing but negativity here. Yahoo is full of emo republican/conservatives that can do nothing but gripe since they've been laid off and/or spent all their money trying to elect McCryptkeeper and his retarded bimbo into office.    The opposition will continue to fondle the jewels of Bush and pray to their almighty Rush LimGIMMESOMEPILLS.     quite sad really :)|`|AVc1PCu5aa	Yeah, he's 100% for breaking all his promises so far.

I think loyal opposition really have no choice.  Elections are over, everyone has to band together,  and unite towards one common goal.|`|QTQTdPO1aa	Doing really great???    How is closing a prison for terrorists great?  How is spending money the gov't doesn't have to bail out is friends great???    I just don't see one good thing he's done.|`|IxYVHATXaa	Wow, really? I havent seen him do anything except help fund abortion internationally, close gitmo, and call an airstrike in pakistan that killed over 15 civilian (women and children).  This site keeps track of his promises: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/...|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Loyal opposition ? or do you mean those of us intelligent enough to look at Obama's resume rather than the color of his skin or vote along party lines ?  Obama hasn't done much for the economy, the months of sliding of the market was companies preparing for Obama's presidency, it wasn't due to Mr. Bush.  We have a solid history of  what has worked in the past yet the government, as usual, isn' t doing it, instead they have failed at the socialist agenda of hand outs and bail outs along with interferring with a free market.  Bush had a deal to remove the troops from iraq in 2011, Obama just wants to push it up sooner so he gets credit.  I see a large porked up stilulus package that 2/3 is full of crap that won't help the economy.  I see Obama saying NO LOBBYISTS in his administration....a good move, yet he hired two of them.  And Gitmo ? Do you really think we will put our citizens at risk by not having some holding facility for terrorists or suspected terrorists ? that would be impeachable. So all the happy little morons dancing in the street have actually closed a known holding camp for an unknown camp being opened somewhere else.  So what was it that Obama has done so far that's praiseable ?|`|wdoxxojKaa	"A great job"?    You are out of your F'ing mind.    Gives American civil rights to terrorists at Gitmo.    Gives 460 million American tax dollars to fund abortion overseas.    ALL his BS cabinet picks.    Grants interview to APPEASE the raghead arabs.    F president Buckwheat.    Yeah great start.    Pearl:  You're a cun+.|`|Uj1ROxELaa	dont listen to those people.   Obama has done great.  much better than bush.  and probably better than McCain he God forbid he became our President!|`|YNd65b3kaa	His fiscal program to spend $850 billion (in new spending) is countered by the GOP (unanimously) who prefer tax cuts.

I honestly don't have a clue but I do worry about our massive debt with China being our main banker.                      How in hell did we get to this point?    If the U.

I think people will wake up in the next 2 years and the house will turn over.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	The opposition with good reasons will always oppose the neocon policy of government expansion of power, size, and cost.    we are all slaves In the court of the neocon king....No matter what party wins.    1) obama already bombed a sovereign nation, pakistan, killing as many as 15 civilians  2) obama already managed to expand MORE DEBT to international groups that provide access to abortions (a logical priority when heading into a depression)  3) he already managed to drive up the national debt 10% just days into office. us true conservatives / libertarians are wondering if obama will manage to spend / waste / steal as much as bush. it is surely a possibility.|`|4TqERLSgaa	Obama the magnificent hasn't done anything so far, but stink up the White House.

Oh Barack, I do love you. Go...Go..Go..Obama!!!|`|cpLoD9NJaa	Doing well at WHAT?      Oh do you mean allowing our tax dollars to go to foreign countries to pay for abortions?    Or do you mean saying Gitmo will close in a year without a plan to put the terrorist anywhere?    Or do you mean raising the cost of purchasing a new car by 2-3K dollars?    Or do you mean all the massive spending he is promoting?      Or maybe it's applauding someone for cheating on their taxes by $34,000?    What exactly is he doing "great" at?
4LbCkFCBaa	The state I am in, and most states in the US, the original court in JDR retains jurisidiction and venue unless they transfer the case.  A transfer hearing here, is simple but it is required.|`|z88IMXNFaa	You can move for a change of venue only if you can make a legal argument that the suit was brought in the wrong venue.  Convenience to you is not a legal argument.|`|QP7VyPV6aa	Generally a court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction for a case forever.  You can get the venue changed, depending on if you meet the requirements, but they probably won't to make it easier on you
cWmx0J4jaa	I'm against it. I don't smoke but I don't think the gov't should tell people what to do. While we are at it, how about getting rid of the seatbelt law too? You are an idiot not to wear one but it shouldn't be mandated by the gov't.|`|LCun3uwTaa	it's human right to enjoy what we are provided on this earth. so i'm against it, even though i dont smoke and i think smokers all stink.|`|77803d031e24e0dc11eed2b7227501eeaa	Only the idiot liberals of California could come up with an idea as stupid as "Tobacco Free California."

I'm glad I don't live in the land of fruits and nuts.|`|o8E9wsPCaa	i am. Even though i dont smoke|`|orVKNrX4aa	Of course I'm against it because doesn't everybody want shriveled up skin, getting a raspy voice, smelling like pee, and having an early death? YAY|`|9qphgJR4aa	I don't think there is enough evidence to support second hand smoke as being a real danger, but I'm not a scientist. I also think that it is ridiculous to tell anyone what they can't put in their body, it's our body, property of us not the government, if other people choose to destroy their own body, then the government should have no say in it, unless their damaging to themselves is also putting others in danger of it. That's why second hand smoke took such popularity, because it made a lifestyle look like it could be hurting others as well as the individual.     Personally I smoke, but I never smoke around children or anyone who has a problem with it, but of course that's not the case of all smokers.    Most people agree that the anti smoking laws have gone to far, not letting a smoker light up in a bar after a 14 hour day of work, based on hazy evidence seems to be enough punishment for the smokers, but haters never stop hating, so they want to press the anti smoking laws farther and farther with the goal being to ban smoking completely. The argument has crossed the line of protecting innocent people of risk, to just fascist views on people's lifestyles.    I find it hilarious that homosexuals and obese people can get more rights than a smoker.    People feel compassion for obese people and homosexuals.    And for some reason they view the tobacco lifestyle with jealousy and scorn.    It's not socially acceptable to call a fat person fat, but there isn't any objection to calling a smoker, dirty things like tar breath. Our culture has made a big mistake, because with their logic on smoking and health, I should be able to call an obese person grease veins, or pig boy, or the countdown for the heart attack, but that isn't socially acceptable. People are very influenced by the media and the media made people stubborn and blind to common sense and courtesy|`|EvlPzrVOaa	kinda tough to say since in Oakland you can grow your own weed for medicinal or personal use. even go to the oaksterdam university to learn how to grow it. they even have to store where u can go in an buy weed an smoke it in there.|`|UMg1CL7baa	If people want to smoke i think they should be allowed to, the government has no say in what we do.

They are scared enough as it is to get caught here without legal documentation to try and get put in jail or deported for credit card fraud or anything of that sort. And so many get screwed over because US Citizens sell them their social security cards and birth certificates for an enormous amount of money and then they report it stolen! aaaaah...I don't get it why it's considered illegal for Mexican's to come into the US but yet, Americans can go into Mexico when they please...and it's not considered illegal?!|`|nqvYvDu7aa	Arrapaho sure loves the publicity    You are right. joe should go !

3GXYel3Kaa	I am not a Dem or a Rep, but one of the things I noticed is that the latter has really failed to redefine itself for the better part of 15 years.  I think the Bush administration did not help in that definition:  I have many Republican friends who were frequently confused and dismayed about not only what was done on their watch, but also in their name.  I believe they are more fragmented and at odds with one another than at any time since the days of FDR.    Were I a member of the Republicans, and admittedly I am not, I would take these next two years or so out in the wilderness to figure out where it is their party ought to go.    Just my two cents...    Cheers.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Haha!  When the republican tried to provide input at the meeting on Friday, Obama said, I trump you because I won.  You call that bi-partisanship?    Anyway, didnt your mom teach you that it is more important to do the right thing than to succumb to peer pressure?|`|fDuCamMraa	First, you need to get your calendar fixed. Democrats blocked every piece of legislation from the time Bush took office until the Democrats took the majority two years ago.    And I do hope Republicans change because I'm tired of the Liberal Lite party caving in to Democrats all the time.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Many republicans originally voted for some of the past bailouts under Bush...but obviously the bailouts aren't solving anything...companies are still going under and jobs are still being lost.

Don't tell me it will create jobs....what a couple of jobs for a week?  How long does it take to re-sod the lawn that the liberal left trampled all over!!!!!    Or the millions of dollars that are going to be used to polish the Washington Monument.    Or the millions of dollars to study STD's.    Thank GOD Republicans voted no to this bunch of BS    GIVE ME A FREAKING BREAK!!!    Obama had a chance to keep his word...a stimulus package without Pork and it didn't happen!!!!!|`|64SObnr5aa	It was a foregone conclusion that would happen, no matter what Obama did. The GOP is, in part, flexing its muscle and also saying the bailout is wrong, at least in its current form.    It will change in the Senate where the dems don't have as heavy a majority.    We'll see how it all plays out.    For now, as far as bi partisanship goes, Obama did what he promised and I believe he will continue with that.    Peace  Jim    .|`|cWmx0J4jaa	You mean, why is one party showing some sanity and not trying to mortgage the future?

You're right that Pelosi is rather getting in the way, but Obama is countering her on this one and getting Republican voices heard.      The representation is not being ignored.  And in fairness, it was being ignored under Bush.  When he left office, he had a 21% approval rating; and it had been there for some time.  The VAST majority of this country saw him for the failure he was, and yet he still kept going as though that didn't happen.    The Republican Party had it's *ss handed to it in 2006, Bush acted the same as though that did not happen.      You want an example of taxation without representation, that would be Bush.  Pelosi may fit as an example, but if you are being truthful about it then you must give Obama the respect he deserves as one who is actually listening to all sides.|`|9Nx0MPaeaa	Since most red states are against the stimulus in the first place, why does it matter if they get something they didn't want in the first place.|`|zrggGS2Caa	After what the Democrats have endured since they lost their majority in 1994, it's not surprising to see payback enter into the equation at some level.

It now has to pass in the Senate.  And if that happens, it has to go to a committee of both house and senate members to work out  a reconciliation bill which has to pass both houses again.    3) Cheer up.  the senate democrats need 60 votes to kill the republican filibuster.

Reason being that, that money is coming from nowhere. They don't have that kind of cash, so what they're doing is printing more money during a time when it is not recommended to do so with no backing. So yeah, it won't do crap-all.

Pissing cash onto a problem has NEVER fixed anything.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Consider that if we use comparable indicators of unemployment, our unemployment right now is greater than that during the Great Depression. Only by ignoring underemployed people and those who have given up looking for work after not finding it can we pretend that present unemployment is not that bad. And they say it's going to get a lot worse.     Remember, it took them a year and a half to figure out that we had been in a recession for a year and a half.

This stimulus is reminiscent of the New Deal.|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Of course read unbiased FDR and it is like DeJavue and a sad ending 13 years of Depression then WWII.|`|ybpJUWRnaa	Government spending represents a stimulus to the economy. It is expansionary fiscal policy. Therefore, this bill will NOT deepen the recession. HOWEVER what you do have to worry about is if this is the most efficient way to get cash in the hands of people and businesses who need it so that individuals can increase buying which will then stimulate business and allow jobs to be added and drag us up out of this recession.    To me it seems that this bill just moves money from one government department other government departments rather than getting it out into real circulation. Government jobs do not create wealth because the salaries are paid from taxes which are collected from people who make the money and grow the economy. It's basically just wealth redistribution. (Not to say we don't need government workers, but adding more government positions doesn't grow the economy because they do not produce anything and thus do not add to GDP). Therefore, I don't think this stimulus package will do very much stimulating. Cutting taxes would be a much less complicated, much more effective approach to economic stimulus.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	No one knows if he will veto his whole campaign message was "change".  But if he does pass it yes we will go into a depression and it will be bad.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	The US is already in a depression.  The government does not call it that as doing so may install panic, however the US economy met the criteria for a depression 6 months ago.    The US was in a recession for almost a year before they actually started calling it what it actually was.    "Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, a depression is characterized by abnormal increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations, mostly devaluations."      Sound about right?|`|GrzC57cdaa	We are not even close to where we were before the Great Depression, but this is a good start to getting there. This kind of spending which was coupled with higher taxation rates is what took us from recession to depression, and it lasted 12 years.

It still appears on coins and currency, and was widely considered the national motto de facto.[2] However, by 1956 it had not been established so by legislation as the official "national motto". The Congressional Record of 1956 reads: "At the present time the United States has no national motto. The committee deems it most appropriate that 'In God we trust' be so designated as U.S. national motto."[1]    One possible origin of In God We Trust is the final stanza of The Star-Spangled Banner. Written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key (and later adopted as the U.S. national anthem), the song contains an early reference to a variation of the phrase: "...And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust'."[3] An alternative origin could be through John Milton Hay who was Abraham Lincoln's personal secretary. Hay was a graduate of Brown University whose motto, In Deo Speramus, is Latin for "In God We Hope".    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_T...|`|5TB3Q88gaa	I don't understand it myself.

Although they cannot force you to take the test, they can deny you further service if you do not cooperate in identifying the father.     If he raped you repeatedly as you say, that should have been reported when it happened, and still can be reported.     Just because he is forced to pay child support does not automatically  mean he will have full visitation rights.     Document abusive behavior through police reports, then petition a judge to specify the time , dates, and conditions that he visits. Repeated violations can later be used to terminate his visits and any parental rights if necessary.

So that people have jobs. Then they will have money to spend... ongoingly. Then they can go out and spend it on stuff and pay off debts. Then businesses and banks will make money. Then CEOs turn a profit.     Then the economy is working for EVERYBODY.|`|wlc0T5heaa	This is the CHANGE that 53% of the US asked for|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	1. It is an $800 billion stimulus package. The money you are discussing is less than 1% of the total.    2. People with AIDS and herpes aren't good for the economy.    3. People get to work and go on vacation using Amtrak. Both of these things stimulate the economy.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	ah, hello people the bill passed, wake up! change is coming for the better.|`|0j9Ggisxaa	Spending your way out of a deficit caused by overspending...

AA11156037	I would say yes.    My daughter joined the ALA based upon my being a military veteran.    How about contacting the ALA unit directly to get the STRAIGHT skinny?    Senior membership is offered to anyone over the age of 18 who is an immediate family member of an American Legion member or a deceased veteran.|`|rYNM67oyaa	It seems you would be eligible to join. It's not just limited to spouses of veterans.    http://www.legion-aux.org/Membership/Eli...|`|GIkjy3AXaa	You are eligible to join and they would be more than happy to have you. You can join most any Post/Auxiliary unit you wish and participate in any way you choose. Good Luck!|`|INRShQ5Naa	If your grandfather served during an eligible era. (basically WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada/Panama, or the Gulf Wars) you are eligble.    Let me tell you, the American Legion Auxiliary would LOVE!! to have you as a member.  You can join either at your hometown or at your college town but you can be involved in either or both.  For example, if you join your "home" unit, you can still participate in the activities at your "school" unit.  Trust me, (unless they are very unusual) the presence of a healthy young college lady would be most welcome.  You could be a "big sister" to the Junior Members, help out with Poppy drives (more likely at your school post since these are around Veterens day and Memorial Day).    Go for it.

They'd pay to give him a back massage while he signed the legislation if they could.|`|70DZWz2Baa	I want them all to oppose the bill. If they don't then they can no longer call themselves republicans. this "stimulus" Bill is just a spending bill. In order to have any affect all of this money will have to be released right away. But no, the stimulus package will be set over 4 years with most of the money being spent in the fourth.  This bill also includes 40 million for a WATERPARK in Florida. I think the private sector is perfectly capable of that. this isn't a stimulus. Just more spending by spendy democrats.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	They are short Al Franken's seat which the republicans will challenge anyway.  If they can massage Lieberman and the remainder of his crew into their camp, they have it made.  Once they break the Republican filibuster it is a done deal.    But it will have to go to a joint committee and be voted on it again.      It is in the senate where we will see the fruits of Obama's outreach.  This vote will set the agenda for the next 2 years.  The republicans will either vote for cooperation or against it.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	The Republicans can't do jack in the Senate, they don't have the votes.|`|JQwL50JMaa	Unfortunately, G, the Congress has an overwhelming majority of Democrats right now so there isn't much that Republicans can do that will make a darn bit of difference.    People will soon realize that one political party having this much power in government is a bad thing.  And my opinion has nothing to do with Democrat or Republican politics.  If the tables were turned and Republicans had this much control, there would still be a problem.  You can think of it as a "tyranny of the majority" type thing.    We need an equal balance of power in Congress to be fair since they are the representatives of ALL people in this country. Not just a chosen few.|`|m0muVAXfaa	I hope Obama scuttles the current package and starts over, doubles the size and puts it all into infrastructure rebuild. he can handle the Senate.
2RE9mMtMaa	I don't get the mail until around noon on Saturday anyway.  By then the banks and post office are closing.  What good does it do?      They should have done this years ago.|`|sHpTGIHYaa	Well, I would care because I do most of my shopping online and rely on packages in the mail to get to me on time. And for most people, I would think they would mind because for some, they just want to get their bills so they can get them paid and out of the way.|`|TttP1sENaa	Personally, I've eliminated as much mail as possible.  My bills come electronically and I pay them online.  Our paychecks are direct deposit.  I signed up to "eliminate" junk mail (ha ha - like it ever goes away).  Sometimes I forget to go to the mailbox . . . they could stop coming here!|`|aLy3ai90aa	Many people rely on checks in the mail. Especially people with businesses and people who still use snail mail to send their check payments for purchases over the internet. There are a lot of people with trust over internet security.     There are still trust issues.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Personally, I wouldn't care if we didn't get mail on Saturdays.  On the other hand, all the rural mail carrier substitutes who deliver mail on Saturdays because the regular carrier is off (5 day work week) will be losing their positions.  This presents a real issue for the rural mail carriers because the substitutes are the only way the route can be covered when someone is sick, on vacation or injured.  As a rural mail carrier retires, it is from that pool of substitutes assigned to that office that the new regular carrier for the route comes from.    It's going to present a logistical nightmare on several fronts along with a lot of part-timers losing their positions.  And the country does not need more people without jobs or losing income.    I think the postal service would be much further ahead to renegotiate their labor contracts with the unions, have the higher ups take some pay cuts and analyze their spending issues.  Just like any other big business, they spend money on nonsensical things.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	The post office up's the cost of stamps every year. They say this is to cover their costs. Now, most people don't really send letters anymore, thanks to email, fax's and text messaging. Many companies are opting for bill pay and notification over the internet. That's great. Also, many companies use private services to send things out via fed/ex (yes, I know, they teamed up with the post office), ups, dhl, etc.  Now, there are some companies who don't mail out checks anymore, they do direct deposit. The post office isn't as important as they like you to think they are. Another thing too, I don't know if you remember, but in the days when JCPenney and Sears used to send out their huge catalogs, the post office complained about that as well. Well, thanks again to the internet, people do most of their shopping online (no more heavy mags here), and not everything is shipped out via the usps.     The post office really isn't half as busy as it was 10 years ago, yet, they act as though limiting the mail by one day would be some kind of hardship on people in general. Seriously, we wouldn't notice. Limit it to delivery once or twice a week.    That's funny you ask... I just asked a question about this http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

And we hit bottom under Obambo, thats exactly what we will do... Minus a few..|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	No can do.  But perhaps we can return to the best of the truths of the American experiment.    One of the things that I most deeply appreciated  in the inaugural address of this President was the recognition of our indebtedness to those who came before us.    Please go back and read the inaugural address and pay special attention to the words from Thomas Paine's   "Common Sense" that George Washington ordered be read to the nation during that most difficult winter of the war for independence:    "Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it."    America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words; with hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come; let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations."    Thomas Paine also wrote, in December of 1776:    "THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."    Wouldn't you like it if future generations could look back and say "thank you" to our generation for meeting the challenges of this day?    One last word, from Helen Keller,    "I am only one, but I am still one.  I cannot do everything, but still I can do something, and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do something that I can do."|`|5d9pCmjyaa	There is no turning back the clock.  It was the United States that crafted international laws that make new governments responsible for the debts of those they succeed.    We made our bed, and now we must wallow in it no matter what we want.    There is no escape.

I'm pleasently surprised. Everyone assumes the Air Force is a cake walk, but it's not. I am not gonna argue that its tougher than the Army or Marine Corp - HECK no. Those are TOUGH. But I do believe the Air Force boot camp is harder than the Navy's. I work at a joint unit (meaning I work with all branches) and when the Navy guys talk about their basic days I get jealous. The hardest week for them is what they call "Battle Stations". Our "Warrior Week" has that beat by a long shot.|`|esOaJoqBaa	I would rate them in order of easiest to hardest as follows:  AF basic  Navy Basic  Army Basic  AF OCS  USMC Basic  Navy OCS  Army OCS  USMC OCS|`|014NXPfFaa	you wont find anyone who's been to all of them to know the answer to that . . .     all basic trainings are probably a similar level of difficulty, same for OCS.
6ade8f304e48ef25e16f2a4444611313aa	~  everybody trying to make a dime.  I wouldn't buy those dolls anyway. I prefer looking at their pictures.  Those are some beautiful young girls.  Period.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	She should be rejoicing. Most dolls targeted to 'girls of color' are dolls like Bratz. Past research has shown kids given a doll to describe: the white doll is 'nice', and the black doll is 'bad'. Bratz or the Ty dolls. I'd rather have my girls playing with the Ty dolls. The Bratz dolls look 'skanky; (a word used by a 4yr ols in my class). The girls in my class say that Bratz don't have to worry about school, and if the look right and talk right they can get boys to do stuff for them.|`|T0pkW783aa	I don't blame Michelle Obama for not approving of the dolls in the image of her daughters and I don't believe it wasn't a planned activity by Ty.    I am not so sure that they will be a hot item but we will see. The one I object to more than these dolls is the doll in the image of Caycee Anthony, the toddler who was murdered.  A company made up a Caycee doll who sings, "You are my sunshine.",just as the child had sung to her grandparents in the tape that was used by the media to let people see her when they were searching for her.  This was as low as you can go; the company pulled the doll off the market when it received so much negative press.  Ty may decide to pull the Malia and Sasha dolls, as well.|`|63b59897c1bba974b8123b8cd4900523aa	so whats your question? if michelle isnt happy with using her children as a marketing profit... why does this bother you?? seriously, why would you care about that?|`|IwBIM1tVaa	Oh yeah I saw that they were so cute one came with a hammer and the other with a sickle sooooooooooo cute!

Even in the euphoria of the dance, she still got that look on her face like she's gonna burst any time! You have to be always careful around her, you never know when you're upsetting her.   She is obviously not for free enterprise, she wants to make money off of our taxes, and all that!|`|7y6yfrQlaa	I dont blame her; not every mother wants their little kids exploited by greedy corporations|`|4woDH5Inaa	Ok.....

PpJF4sctaa	the first time she comes to canada she will have to show them she has a round trip plane ticket to get back home.  she is allowed to stay 6 months on a visitors visa.  if yall decide to marry before the 6 months is up then yall have 2 options - in canada application or out of canada application for permanant residency.  if she files a IN canada application you will essentially be required to support her until they either accept or deny her application - and they can not legally deport her unless it is denied.  this is the route i took and it took me about 15 months to process the application.  she will not be allowed to work, go to school, etc. and you will be required to show proof that you can support her entirely. option 2 is an OUT of canada application and is supposedly a little quicker at getting processed.  you two will marry and she will return home before her 6 month visitor visa has expired. if her application is approved she will then be allowed to return to canada.  expect to spend $1000+ either way.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	well first she must come as a tourist and she will probably need a visa.     SO she MUST have proof that she WILL go home after the visit. (even if she doesnt go home) .     She must also have enough mnoney to support herself while she is here.   She cannot be visiting family - that is a dead give away that she intend to stay. She can visit friends though. She MUST not say she is getting married or she will be denied entry.     when she gets to Canada you can get married and then you must apply for her on an inside applicaiton, Be aware that she will NOT be allowed to work for thre first part opf processing. Later on when she passes the first stage of approval, then she can get a health card and a work permit and get a job.     Final processing for inside applications are taking anywhere fron 1 to 2 years.     also her english needs to be fairly fluent as her language skills will be teasted.      my wife is foreign and I (the canadian citizen) applied for her on an inside application. She is now a PR. We also met online and our relationship DOES WORK. we have ben married for 8 years. So please ignore the negative attitude from the first answer.     But she is right about the girls who marry just to get into the west and then dump the spouse and go somewhere else.     You must have met and the longer your relationship, the better chance of a marriage lasting more than 2 years.|`|ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	Have you actually met this person or is this another internet "romance"? I ask this not because I have no faith in international relationships but that a lot of women from places like Ghana strike up an internet "romance" with someone from Canada or the US. Their intent is to try and gain instant citizenship and then take advantage of you. They will insist on marrying you, to keep it all honourable, and then use you and your money to sponsor all their family members to come which, incidentally, you would have to financially support. If that doesn't work out, they then divorce you, break your heart into a million little pieces, and then you will spend the rest of your life financially supporting them.    Either way, you wind up losing.    I should mention, too, that immigration officials are keenly aware of such attempts by so many young women from places like Ghana and so will look upon such a relationship with a huge amount of suspicion. Even if her intentions are truly honourable, you will have a miserable time trying to convince immigration officials that you two are sincerely in love with each other.    Look through http://www.cic.gc.ca and read through the whole site very carefully.|`|AA12365543	You do know she is using you for a visa and will abandon you once she is secure to do so?|`|AA10045620	"Z's" answer is right on.

Thanks for the compliment...much appreciated.    Las Vegas and Manhattan believe in living in excess -- not something I'd brag about considering our current economic problems.  They're also cities full of sharks, shysters and thieves...and many make a living taking advantage of others.

No problem, you're welcome for the food...I knew you were thinking up a way to extend a thank you...a safe assumption I'm sure.|`|AA10811674	They shouldn't be. Republicans traditionally have been the party representing farmers and small business. Democrats have been the party of labor and large cities. Nothing is wrong with either one. In the past the Democrats have taken more of a bent to the left. although they pretty much have come back nearer the center since the Clinton Administration. The Republicans made a sharp right beginning with Reagan. Where they will wind up in 2012 is anyones guess. I do believe they will move back towards the center.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	So you confess that Repubs feed your dumb azz.  Thanks, we already knew that.

Rural America is just as important as the cities.  If it were not for farmers, you'd have very little food except for the wharf rats down on the South Street Seaport.     In addition, it was people like that who banded together as American Minutemen during the Revolutionary War and gained our independence.     so ashamed?  Nope.      Are you ashamed that you have more violence and drugs than rural areas?  Perhaps you should be.

8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	If someone is in jail, and they have a bond of $20,000 and they can't afford it, they call you.    They pay you a fee (usually 10%, OR $2,000 in this case) and you, in turn, promise the court that they will show up for their court date.  You keep the $2,000.    If they don't show up, then you will owe the whole $20,000 if you don't find them and MAKE them show up, so you go looking for them.|`|bJRR9GRraa	Fugitive recovery agents and bail agents are not the same thing.      Pretend you get arrested and have bail set at $10,000.  If you parents or friends don't have $10,000, they can go to a bail agent.  Most bail agents charge 10%, $1,000 in this case, to post your bond.  The bail agent is now responsible for making you show up in court or having to pay the other $9,000 of the bail money.  If you show up, great.  If not, the bail agent is out $9,000.  This is where a fugitive recovery agent, or bounty hunter, comes into play.  A bail agent will hire a bounty hunter to find you.  For finding you, the bail agent will pay the bounty hunter a certain percentage of the bond.|`|cCjmNgTnaa	For one, Dog is lucky he is still alive.  He puts himself in harms way with no training.

Sometimes he collects, otherwise he takes the collateral given for the money and sells it.

DTSUJe2oaa	A Firearms carry permit entitles the owner to publicly carry a legally owned weapon, loaded in a concealed or non-concealed manner. A mandatory legal and safety class and shooting proficency tests are required to obtain such a permit. Carry permits are usually only issued to persons with a particular need for carrying a firearm. This includes licensed hunters, law-enforcement officers, security personnel and persons living under a raised threat-level like celebrities and politicians.    The weapons law does not apply to military use of weapons within the Bundeswehr.    The identity card of German troops contains a term allowing them carrying weapons. Nevertheless, issuance of guns and especially ammunition is also very strictly controlled within the armed forces.~|`|rejJg1R2aa	I think so but it is not a very good idea to carry a gun in Germany but I know that there are people who carry guns.    So if civilians can carry guns or not in Germany I do not know but I do know that people do have guns.
b1C3xs3Jaa	No.    If we imprison someone, it must be for a reason. That means you have proof and you charge them, or you have no proof and you let them go. It is very easy to connect someone to terrorism if they are truly connected, and military tribunals are fast, cheap, and easy.     There is no legal power to hold someone indefinitely because you have no proof to charge them.    Guantan should have been shut down years ago, not a year in the future.

But the fact is, that closing GITMO is what will be just one of many blunders Obama commits during his Presidency that clearly illustrate his ignorance of how the military works. Obama has NO experience in world affairs, and if you bothered to read any of his books prior to casting your uninformed vote, you would know that when faced with terrorists, his rule of thumb is to offer them cupcakes and milk and talk about it ! He's an idiot and all I can say is that Roosevelt said it best, walk softly and carry a BIG stick !!! Who in his right mind closes a prison without even knowing what will happen to the inmates ? Obama does !!! We will all pay for this fools incompetence.|`|IWlPfk1raa	This is one subject I do agree with. I would even think all Americans would agree as well. This is not just a legality issue but a symbolic one. That are government is limited to the constitution. I think this is one issue President Obama was correct.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	American maximum prisons are far less friendly, accommodating, and safer than Gitmo is. If I had a choice I'd choose Gitmo any day. I would like to see them in maximum security prisons because it would be more like the punishment they deserve. These are prisoners of war and war prisoners are kept until the end of a war and then released to their home country. American prisoners of war did not have trials during WW2 and were not released until the end of the war.|`|77ab0bba157746561273207e1a20c73baa	NO leave it open and put George Bush in it|`|sHpTGIHYaa	No! That was his biggest mistake so far. If you shut it down and deport the detainees, they will return to committing terrorist acts, and guess who will be the first target?    The United States.    Obama is going to destroy this country.|`|lZe1daRAaa	I agree.The closing of Guantanamo will lead to the democratization of the island and the cleansing of corruption terrorism and communist drug cartels in the island.|`|v3dTJIrcaa	No way...no surprise though.....lets see what state they go to or what country we will pay off to take in terrorists into their penal system|`|4bc1c9d7862281f68503cd3445c1c598aa	So first of all he didn't close it.      He hopes to close it within 1 year if he can find solutions to all the problems closing it causes.    He only verified the reason Bush put it in place.      Everyone needs to start understanding that Bush did thing for our protection.  And while it's easy to bash him things like Gbay were really necessary.|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	Must disagree with Vote_USA.  The people being held in Gitmo are being detained because they present a risk to Americans and American interests.  It is lawful to detain them while war is being fought, and it's not necessary to prosecute them.  They will be released when the war has ended and they no longer pose a significant threat to us.    They are not Americans so constitutional law does not have to apply.        The problem of what to do with these people is huge.  Those of you who live in Denver, your backyard is one of the places under consideration.  How do you feel about that?|`|AA11511852	no,no and again no.  It should not be closed nor should  these people go free.|`|H3DOlkQOaa	yes, I agree because commies are anti-Americans, The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution urging the United States to end its unilateral blockade against Cuba, the 17th consecutive year that an overwhelming majority in the assembly have supported the measure.    The resolution entitled "Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America against Cuba," cleared the 192-member assembly with a vote of 185 for, three against and two abstentions.    The United States and Israel, voted against the resolution,  and Micronesia and Marshall Islands abstained.    The United States has no diplomatic relations with Cuba, lists the country as a state sponsor of terror and has long sought to isolate it through travel restrictions and a trade embargo. The blockade was imposed in 1962.    Guantanamo will be closed, but Guantanamo Bays reminds as a US property|`|qDuXqxlKaa	Yes.    Of course it presents logistical problems.    But the basic moral and legal issue of keeping prisoners detained indefinitely without trials is much, much more worrisome. Even worse, it's now coming to light that many of the most dangerous and seriously evil detainees were tortured, so they can't be tried in any Western court--because confessions that are results of torture are inadmissible.    We did this to ourselves. None of these questionable "interrogation methods" should ever have taken a foothold. There should have been a mechanism for evidentiary proceedings and trials from the beginning. We shouldn't have tried to circumvent the Geneva Convention's exhortations about how to treat POWs by calling them "detainees."    Gitmo was and is a shady, shady place. Its mere existence was becoming a major recruitment tool for terrorists--supposed proof of how evil we are. It's great that it will be gone.|`|fyg63cOHaa	I don't know alot about it, but I have heard they are sending all the prisoners back to their own country to be held and tried.  Honestly, as screwed up as things are I say why not, it could work.
PI8VfiY1aa	5th amendment is the right to due process (a fair trial).     13th is the amendment to abolish slavery    21st is the repeal (undoing) of Prohibition (the act that made Alcohol illegal). So basically the 21st amendment nullifies the 18th amendment.    This is easy stuff...you can figure this out. Just read the amendments.
acWyJ3t0aa	No you are absolutely right on your history and on the fact that you can not spend your way out of a recession , you can only make it worse . According to what I saw on TV today in the house the bill passed and all the democrats except 11 voted for it and all of the republicans voted against it despite being told by Obama that he wanted everyone on board for his budget . After the vote some top Republicans were invited to a little gathering with Obama and his staff . Obama did not do it , but one of his cronies did this . They warned the Republicans that they were playing with their political careers if they did not get onboard Obamas train , this on top of Obama telling them the other day that they were not to watch or listen to Rush Limbaugh if they wanted to get along with him . He has gone totally mad and thinks he is a one man show . Look out America|`|AA11996791	It's nothing but PORK. Typical agenda of liberals with no backbone to think only of their pet projects and ignore the dire needs of the nation.      The non-job creating spending in this bill includes:    a) $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. ( will this create 1 job?)  b) $400 million to study climate change. ( Whats there to study? Its a climate change!)  c) $200 million to revitalize the National Mall, including planting new sod.( BULLDOZE IT DOWN around $10,000 +removal!)  d) $1.1 billion to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a permanent board to ration health care services, a precursor to universal health care. (A Billion dollar BOARD OF HEALTH? Enough for FREE HEALTH CARE for a YEAR!)  e) Hundreds of millions of dollars for contraceptives and family planning services through Medicaid.  f) $650 million dollars for additional digital TV converter box coupons. ( turn the TV off and get to basics, IDIOTS!)  g) $166 billion in direct aid to help states pay their bills. ( Due to illegal immigrants)  h) $13 billion for reading programs.  i) $15.6 billion to increase the maximum annual Pell grant (for college students) by $500 from $4,360 to $4,860.  j) $3 billion to public health departments for additional immunizations. ( immunize yourself from a DUMB Govt)  k) $1 billion in additional funding to pay heating bills of low-income Americans  l) $1 billion for the 2010 census. ( To count illegal IMMIGRANTS?)  m) $100 million for National Science Foundation scholarships.  n) $200 million for nutrition programs. ( Buy Macdonalds , Burger King and the rest of them foul places AND SHUT THEM DOWN!)  o) $200 million to provide incentives to teachers to raise test scores. ( Teach students how to write a check, pay a bill, apply for a scholarship, grocery shop, how to apply for a rental apt, EVERYDAY STUFF YA KNOW? BUT TEST SCORES? Bunch of Simpletons)  p) $2 billion in additional funds for low-income child care.  q) $900 million in additional funds to prepare for the pandemic flu. ( WHAT? Probably find a cure for every disease in the world with that money!)|`|QTQTdPO1aa	They just don't care.  Their GOD can do no wrong.

Obama creates all the laws of Nature, like science and economics.  If he says spending will reduce the debt it will damnit!|`|sZFLtCbdaa	The Obama Zombies believe because they don't understand economics to begin with and for the most part, they have never worked for a living.  Anyone that has a job knows that you don't get out of debt through borrowing. If I bring home $1,000 per week, I can't spend $1,250 to get out of debt. Not even $1,001 of spending per week is going to get me out of debt. I would have to spend less then I am bringing in to get out of debt. And that is where the Obama Zombies fall short.|`|TJpQZju2aa	Its true that the normal response to recessions is interest-rate cuts from the Fed, not government spending. And that might be the best option right now, if it were available. But it isnt, because were in a situation not seen since the 1930s: the interest rates the Fed controls are already effectively at zero.    Thats why were talking about large-scale fiscal stimulus: its whats left in the policy arsenal now that the Fed has shot its bolt. Anyone who cites old arguments against fiscal stimulus without mentioning that either doesnt know much about the subject  and therefore has no business weighing in on the debate  or is being deliberately obtuse.|`|AA11268819	It doesn't matter to them.  As long as Obama say it good, they could care less.    Look what the liberals added to the "Economic stimulus package"...

We have nothing to show for it, unless you think the bank balances of companies like Halliburton and Blackwater count.    The spending bill will address many problems that have gone ignored and unfunded for years.|`|XQbEyVJ1aa	No, a person can't spend their way out of debt, but the difference is that the USFG can deficit spend. The stimulus plan involves massive public spending projects to revitalize the economy. Mostly infrastructure I believe. I don't know if it will work or not, but I don't know of any economists who are against it, the budget office never said that in my knowledge, and FDR did get us out of the depression, so you made basically no good point.

gdYN39gtaa	Yes, becasue 88% of it is "PORK" and he told them to pass    this package quickly. Could he have NOT wanted them to have   time to look over  this billion dollar package and see where the 88%   of the hand-outs were going that will not stimulate the economy?   I think it should have been given some time for congress to look   over before voting. Then, much of that pork should have been   eliminated so most of the money would be to stimulate the economy,   not wasted on pork projects.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Yes but I expected it.  The Democrats wrote the bill, the Democrats have the House majority, the Democrats voted for their bill.  No Republican voted for it due to all of the pork.    Now it'll go to the Senate where the Democrats have the majority and it will pass again.  Then a Democrat president will sign it.    There aren't any significant checks and balances when both Houses and the presidency are all the same party.|`|9bb789fb1a182ebae292a0ef4f9b205eaa	Yes its a joke, but this stimulus was not made for the people that care about this country.|`|C46DNX11aa	Nope!|`|OFA2LAM5aa	As he said, we have no time to spare.

Safety, again.  16.Women are able to retain all property they owned prior to marriage in the case of divorce. However, this provision does not apply to men.

a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa	The Republican reaction to the Stimulus Package seems tragic to me. Maybe the Democrats share more blame than I want to admit, but I doubt it.    What I'm not seeing in the media is any Republican alternative. The only thing that is getting attention is their claim that the stimulus benefitted special interests and won't come on line quick enough. But surely there are things the Republicans could suggest that would improve the bill.     Did they suggest improvements, and not get attention? Or are they following the cookie-cutter Neo-Con argument that the only thing that can be done is  nothing?    What a waste. The Republicans could be throwing away a chance to stop their losing streak and improve the nation's economy and tone. And if that's true, the only thing they're getting in return is mmore support from Neo-Cons (who haven't delivered a victory for them in four years.    ++++++Added+++++++    Okay, I just read over some of the other answers. Just more Partisan bickering, mostly from Republicans, but also some from Democrats.    Fantastic! That kind of politics got us here, and a lot of people obviously think it'll get us out.

First, you don't have to listen to the Republicans. The Democrats have a majority in congress. That's how the so-called stimulus package was passed. Secondly, while there was a Republican President for the last 8 years, the Democrats have been in control of congress since 2006. It was then that the economy went south. It's the congress that controls the purse strings.     So, how much of the stimulus package are you familiar with? Do you know that only 3% of that money will be put into the economy in the next 13 months? Do you realize that $21 million of it is for sod for the National Mall when sod costs $.34 a square foot? Do you know that billions are slated for programs like ACORN, which is already under criminal investigation in several states?  Here are just a few more of the programs and projects that have been included in it:     $650 million for digital TV coupons.     $600 million for new cars for the federal government.     $6 billion for colleges/universities  many which have billion dollar endowments.     $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.     $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.    It goes on and on. But here's to that "unity" you people keep talking about. When are we going to see some of it?|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Ok The Yahoo police dinged me for this answer once already:  We should not.    Because bad ideas, no matter how bad they have been proven how many times, will just not go away.      Just it has been tried twice and failed twice (1929, 2008) Doesn't mean it will not work the third time.    The writers of the constitution said " If men were angels, we would not need government.  If men were ruled by angels, any government would do.  However this is not the case."  The problem lies with everybody that holds the idea that while this applies to government it is true but it is false when it applies to the economy.  Idiocy reigned since the Reagan Administration and the economy has gone down since.  Put an end to the idiocy, let a bad idea finally die.|`|pWxh08O9aa	Asking a former druggie to run a country is a pretty stupid idea, right?|`|x2dIXREWaa	Obama leaves more intelligence in his fecal matter than Bush, the former-druggie ever provided us with in 8 years of his awful, disastrous reign of tyranny.|`|3uH441n3aa	Because the dems are going to make everyone else pay to fix the car before they crash it next.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	Exactly.

Just a little of the pork padded bill ....  $6 million for broadband Internet access  millions for coupons to help people switch old televisions to digital  $200 million for fresh sod on the National Mall  $360 million to fight sexually transmitted disease, including money for contraceptives  Money for a water park in miami and arts programs    I think that I am going to vomit now! Dems controlled congress for the last 4 years.|`|AA10075828	Yes, definitely. I'm a Democratic supporter in this fight, but the bill is far, far from perfect. I think Obama himself would agree that we NEED to hear (AND react to!) both sides: that's the best way to "tweak" the bill to be as effective as it can be. I'm grateful for the weaknesses the opposition (through that darn "drive by" media that's so in the tank for Obama that it gives him a "pass" on everything ;-) because it has pointed out things that would be a waste. I just wish we'd learn the NAMES of the Congressmen or women who put the pork in there. I think that'd be a huge step forward in getting some accountability from our "representatives."    BTW, I'm one who believes this was part of the plan all along. The new administration is counting on the Senate to act like the Senate has always acted: to rein in the extremes found in the House due to the House's electoral pressures (of having to run for office every two years). The House gets hysterical a lot. The Senate is a much more mature bunch, thank heaven.|`|aVEVchFxaa	You got that right.|`|ojPFIHvWaa	You shouldn't.

Learn about whats in the bill and then learn as much as you can about the workings of the economy . Then decide for yourself.

Stick to 16 and 17-year olds for a while, dear.  Trust me.  This way, the little 19-year old boyfriend won't end up in jail for getting you pregnant...See?  It can all be avoided.

i0vcEyJtaa	No. Big government = more corruption, more bloated bureaucracies, taxes increases, spending increases, eventually if you look back at history, empires like Nazi Germany and the USSR all bankrupted themselves, big government is just very inefficient, too secretive, and very limited to the public knowledge.|`|bXn6WGaXaa	To quote Graham Nash, "Won't you please come to Chicago?"    Come to Cook County Hospital. Check out Chicago's public housing. Spend some time in our schools. Drive our roads. Take it all in.

If you think that big business is too evil, you want a government that is so big that it can and will keep big businesses under its thumb. If you think there are too many criminals running wild and that the drug trade is too big, then you will want the government to build big prisons to put the crooks into jail and keep them there as long as possible. If you think that there is a big movement of illegal aliens into this country you will want the government to big a build wall along the border and hire more and more border patrol agents to try to put a stop to illegal border crossings. And so on.|`|UezXqDF6aa	I do no think that having a big government is a good thing because the bigger the government is: the harder it is to controll the people. For example If you have a bunch of small governments that controll the people, they would one have better chance at making the people in that government, more satisfied, and would be able to help those people more than that of the big government. A big government it is harder to please the people and provide the things that the people need not to mention having a bunch of small governments over a large group of people is so much easier to maintain and keep under controll  than one big government over the large crowed. But then it would be a good thing because it would cause so much less confussion in trying to keep up with each type of government.|`|CckSmGxUaa	Hell no, if someone ran for president that said, "If you elect me, then I will get the government out of your lives", I would vote for him.|`|EhvulfKraa	If you like to be a slave to the same...sure.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	It's not necessary to be in shape to be shipped off to your initial training however it will make life much more miserable than it will be if your not.    I'm not sure on what the initial rules are now but sometimes they may require you to take a pre test prior to starting you boot camp. If you can't pass it then you will be sent to a training area until you can meet the minimum. Don't worry too much though because it isn't usually a very difficult test.     Once you have started in basic training you are expected to become more proficient in completing a physical training test. If after about 4 weeks you haven't shown that you can pass your minimum test to graduate you will be recycled.    Hope this helps.|`|rJLeVoMKaa	You will want to check with the recruiter, but I believe you answer is yes.

1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	The US Marines are a ground (and air) fighting force. They are a part of the US Navy, but operate and recruit independently.    The US Navy is a sea fighting force. The project US force on the world's oceans, and, more importantly, to any place within striking distance of ships at sea (and these days that's, well, everywhere).    The US Coast Guard's mission is more law enforcement and safety related. Their job is to protect US coastlines and waterways.    As for opinions... like any service, it's a matter of what you're looking to do. My suggestion is to talk with recruiters and ask a lot of questions -- that's what they're there for.    EDIT: If you are not keen on combat, but want to make a difference in lives, then you should certainly check out the Coast Guard. Not really any combat per se, but it can still be dangerous -- you may well find yourself on the only ship heading INTO a storm.|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	Desk jobs?     Rofl.

The Marines and Navy's core mission is to kill people and break things - or to be so good at it that it counts as a deterrent to keep people from doing bad things.  The core mission of the Coast Guard is to keep people safe.  It may be from maintaining buoys on our nations' waterways, or it may be by guarding a port or oil rig in Iraq... but the key word is "safety."    And we're the only ones that train every day to do the things we do every day - instead of training for a battle that we pray will never happen.    We DON'T wait for anyone or anything, except for people to pick their jaws up from the floor when they finally realize all the things that we actually do - and where we are operating.|`|UrUpWmA7aa	Marines = combat jobs  Navy = desk jobs  Coast guard = little bit of both|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Marines, Navy, or Coast Guard?

In the hope of avoiding regime collapse and an uncontrolled influx of refugees across its 800-mile border with North Korea, China has helped sustain Kim Jong-Il's regime and opposed harsh international economic sanctions.    However, China was under a lot of international pressure to cut ties with North Korea because of concerns regarding its nuclear program development.

Change your married last name to hers.    Severe an ear, and mail it to her (take a photo for immigration)    Pierce your nose with a large ring, so she can guide you around with it -like they do with cattle.    Remove what makes you male, and put it in a jar,and give it to her. (women do this to their husbands after marriage anyway.. but you can prove your willingness by doing it for her, and save her the trouble)    As you plan for your new home (for when you move out) already plan for the spare room for the mother in law.  You have to have her near-by so she can instruct your wife on what a bad choice she made in marriage, so she can remind her every day, and be there in the morning to "tisk tisk" at you, over the breakfast cereal.    Get the little lap dog she wants, not the manly bulldog you want.      Ok seriously, (I had to poke fun)  although I have no experience in this, but reason suggests they want to make sure you guys are "realy"together    Make sure you know all her relatives names, her favorite things,  her food allergies, and that she has that mole on her inner thigh.    Know her dreams and aspirations, and everything that you should know when you are getting married to someone.    Think" the newly wed game"  and you should be right down that alley.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiLvXt_q...|`|7KjNTjz5aa	Pictures, letters. They love it when you have pictures of each other at family functions, even bars, shows that you are spending time together, family and recreation, I personally never understood how someone else could determine whether or not you loved your spouse, me and my husband never had a problem, we were approved right away, but then i also had evidence that we lived together (both names on lease) 2 years before we ever got married, while his cousin and his wife had tons of problems and had to go before a judge twice, with MORE evidence. I remember when the interviewer asked my husband if we fought, he said I don't but she does, she just BLAH BLAH BLAH, the lady thought that was funny, and said 'OH YEAH YOUR MARRIED" so maybe try stuff like that on your interview... best of luck to you

G7SmEfLdaa	It is impossible to tell, because the two modern parties are very different from the parties back then. Revolutionary and Anti-Revolutionary.  What I can tell you is that the founding fathers and the other revolutionaries had "Classical Liberal" views (fiscal supply side economic policies and a strong emphasis on self-reliance, opposed to the welfare state like republicans, but had a strong emphasis on individual civil rights and liberties like the modern day Democrats, even though they did support slavery, which is the kicker issue that makes this incredibly complex) Most likely their views match what we would consider nowadays to be the Libertarian Party. King George III from looking at his ruling style he was authoritarian, obviously supported a lot of government influence in the economy (through his taxing), upheld an aggressive, imperialistic foreign policy, and neglected civil liberties, especially for the colonists, and supported the national Anglican Church.  So i suppose the people who supported him shared some of his views, and were also Statists authoritarians (Think somebody who is for high taxes, anti-gay marriage, anti-abortion, wants more government intervention in the economy, anti-civil liberties and pro-police) This is mostly just my theory though and may or may not answer your question.|`|0eFSeap5aa	They were monarchists in that they supported an inherited ruler.

F1bjZjkaaa	WHat do you mean, "gun control always kills people"?     The USA has gun control that even the NRA supports. Does the banning of guns for criminals and the insane "always kill people"? I don't think so.    Besides, why is it that republican states have a higher average crime rate, no matter which way you try to find out what a republican state is.   Also the murder rate is higher for republicans than it is for democrats.     The average for a state (all this is pre nov 2008 elections) with a democratic governor the crime rate is 3594.24 and a murder rate 4.4  The average for a state with a republican governor the crime rate is 3860.85 and a murder rate of 5.35    The average for a state with a democratic governor and two democratic senators the crime rate is 3891.6 and a murder rate of 4.9  and the average for a state with a republican governor and two republican senators the crime rate is 4089.45 and a murder rate of 6.16     The average for a state with two democrats and one republican in these three positions the crime rate is 3528.26 and a murder rate of 3.96  The average for a state with two republicans and one democrat in these three positions the crime rate is 3619.71 and a murder rate of 4.89    Now, the average prison population in states with a democratic governor is 375.57  The average in states with a republican governor is 432.55     For three democrats it is 363.73  For three republicans it is 456.43     For two democrats and one republican it is 387.44  ANd for two republicans and one democrat it is 410.71     For states which voted Obama in the elections of 2008 the average crime rate is 3582.19  and a murder rate of 4.28  For states which voted McCain the average crime rate is 3876.19 and a murder rate of 5.51     For the states that voted more than 60% Obama the average crime rate is 3384.69  and a murder rate of 4.17   For states that voted more than 60% for McCain the crime rate is 3730.35  and a murder rate of 5.0    The average crime rate of states which have consistently voted democrat since 1992 in the presidential elections is 3452.49  and a murder rate of 4.66    The average crime rate of states which have consistently voted republican since 1992 in the presidential elections is 3631.54  and a murder rate of 4.81    The average for states which have voted democrat since 1992, and have a democratic governor and two senators the crime rate is 3606.84  For states which everything republican the average crime rate is 4010.33    For states which have both houses as democrat, the average crime rate is 3668.79  For states which have both houses (plus unicamera nebraska) as republican the average crime rate is 3788.67    So in other words, what the republicans are doing, is not working. These are the "startling facts"    Then we can move on to the international statistics. I have provided a link below. The US has the highest murder rate in the developed world. 0.0279271 per 1,000 people are murdered per year.     Canada 0.00502972 per 1,000 people (this is one quarter of your rate)  UK 0.00102579 per 1,000 people (this is one eighth of your rate)    I doubt you could find anything that shows that guns in the US help to reduce murders, because all the statistics point the opposite way.     Though i would like to hear your good arguments backed up with facts and figures from reputable sources.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	To start with here in South Dakota we have very little gun control at all (except to hit what you aim at) and we have the second lowest violent crime rater per capita in the US in 2007, far lower than neighboring Minnesota.    This is very difficult to accomplish.  The NRA has over four million members, their own internet radio station, their own magazine and they still have a hard time getting the word out.  The mainstream media is rather anti gun they pick and choose who you will get to listen to on the nightly news and on various news programs and seldom are they gun friendly.    Also the hypocritical Hollywood types sensationalize gun violence and at the same time they do their best to tell you that guns are bad and no one should have one and the NRA is a bunch of Nazi extremist hicks.

Whether you agree or not , its an interesting  lesson in history. Something to think about..     *In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun  control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million  dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were  rounded up and exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From  1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to  defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *Germany established gun control in 1938 and  from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and  others who were unable to defend themselves were  rounded up and exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *China established gun control in 1935. From  1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents,  unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and  exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *Guatemala established gun control in 1964.  From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to   defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *Uganda established gun control in 1970. From  1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend   themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From  1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable   to defend themselves, were rounded up and  exterminated.  --------------------------------------...  *Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated  in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.   --------------------------------------...  *It has now been 12 months since (1996 National Agreement on Fireams) gun owners in  Australia were forced by new law to surrender  640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their  own government, a program costing Australia  taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. The first  year results are now in:  Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent  Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent  Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent   (yes, 44 percent) !     In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are  now up 300 percent.     (Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the   criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns!)     While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady   decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since criminals now are  guaranteed that their prey are unarmed .    There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and   assaults of the ELDERLY.  Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety   has decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in successfully ridding Australian society of guns.  The Australian experience and the other historical facts above   prove it. (Additional data availabe at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politic...  --------------------------------------...  You wont see this data on the American evening news or hear our president, governors or other politicians disseminating this information.    Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws affect only the law-abiding citizens .     Take note my fellow Americans....before its too late!    The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them of this history lesson.  With guns, we are citizens. Without them, we are subjects.    If you value your freedom, Please spread this anti-gun control  message.

Because of that we have a great deal of clout.  With Mexico (about 7% of the worlds GDP) and Canada (about 7%) this would give us...collectively about half of the worlds economy.  Pretty tough to overlook.  Overall...it was good for the US, Mexico and Canada.

WO68RZdIaa	Unless thing have changed, that sounds right.     During ROTC, you will be taking a college course that will be very much like AIT. If you go to AIT before you need that course, you can have the credits for going to AIT applied for that course & you won't need to take it. If you do not go to AIT before taking that course, you will use that course in lieu of AIT. Then once you complete the 4 yr ROTC program, receive your commission- then you are off for OBC.    This is based on & assuming that you are planning on going into the US Army Reserve & not active duty- correct?|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	Now that I'm thinking it over, I'm second guessing myself.     My first thought was that everyone has to go AIT. But he may have said that because, if you go in as an officer, with a degree in nursing, you wouldn't have to do it.    Check goarmy.com on the officers page. And I would double check with an Army Reserves recruiter. Cover every single base you can cover.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Sounds like a split option to me. If you don't go to AIT you will not have a MOS, which I don't think is a good idea. I would advise that you talk to a reserve recruiter. Also there are options for "Reserve First" which is somewhat what you are describing.|`|q791er1naa	You get a direct commission as a nurse, you wont need AIT because you will already be trained (through college) for what your career in the military will be. (Nursing)    Also, you can't join the military and then just leave and go to college..If you join, then you are in.  He must be referring to taking night classes while you are in...Which is going to take you IONS to get a college degree.   You better just get your degree, THEN talk to a recruiter with your education in hand.|`|sdNArv1Raa	Yes it is True, but If you go to basic and AIT for the Army reserve and then start Collage an take ROTC you only have to do Two years of ROTC because you will have done basic and AIT.

Once the Shah fell, the fundamentalists installed a theocracy, based on Islamic law.    Under the Shah, Iranian women dressed as they chose, and were allowed to pursue professions, etc. It wasn't paradise...but Neither was what followed.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	There were certainly some tensions, a lot of young people tossing off the standards of religion that had been central to most people's lives. Even some incursion of women into the working world where previously only men had been allowed.    Not to assume that Islam had been abandoned by most people. There was still a very strong attachment to traditions, and even persecution of other religions. But largely the law was giving some protection to minority religions.     One should assume that there was just a bounce back when the revolution  took place. For a large part of Iranians there was some level of approval for the end of the slide into western behavior. Remember that after the revolution there was at least a lot of people eager to force everyone else back to more strict observance. That did not happen in a blink of an eye.     Before the revolution, there was a very limited sort of democracy, with a Shah  in charge who did not need to keep everyone happy.  One has to wonder if it would have been possible to have everyone happy with a true democracy. We do not appear to accomplish that here.|`|d9db69f7061f400380778a2c50c826a5aa	In 1953 Iran's prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq, was removed from power in a complex plot orchestrated by British and US intelligence agencies ("Operation Ajax." Many scholars suspect that this ouster was motivated by British-US opposition to Mossadeq's attempt to nationalize Iran's oil.)     With strong support from the USA and the UK, the Shah further modernised Iranian industry but crushed civil liberties. Domestically, he advocated reform policies, culminating in the 1963 program known as the White Revolution, which included land reform, the extension of voting rights to women, and the elimination of illiteracy. However, his autocratic rule, including systematic torture and other human rights violations deeply angered the Iranians.     This time of oppression led to the Iranian revolution and overthrow of his regime in 1979, with an Islamic republic established by popular vote.
EroXBvDNaa	yes, you just have to prove they lived with you most if not all of the time|`|z88IMXNFaa	In most states, a child support order can only be modified for future payments.  In order to get child support, you will first have to get the court to make you the custodial parent.|`|qDuXqxlKaa	You have to adjust your custodial arrangement to reflect the reality of your situation. Do that RIGHT NOW. You're not doing yourself any favors by still operating under an agreement that says you don't have custody when you actually do.    Talk to your lawyer about changing your custody agreement to reflect the fact that you're the primary physical custodial parent. As long as you have the kids more than half the time (which it sounds like you do) that should be a piece of cake.     Once you've been established as the parent with primary physical custody (as opposed to legal custody, which I assume you still share) you can file for support. In fact, many states mandate a child support order when there's a drastic change in the custody agreement.|`|gwqS6xHpaa	You can go for new Child Support in most states, but not old usually.  I suggest trying to change it as soon as possible if it makes economic sense. But, going for old child support when there was an order against you will be tough.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Yes.  A woman is financially responsible for her kids just like a man.  You must do this in court.

More is needed in America than just putting money back into the broken system. That is a band-aid fix.

I live on Oahu and know of many other origins of non americans working here (Marshallese, Micronesians, etc.). The best way to go about it all, if you really wanted to make things legit is to find out who the companies are who are hiring the non americans and report them to the IRS. It is not right for a person to receive an income and not pay taxes on it.

JDltTREfaa	If you're on probation then you've been arrested and have been found or pled guilty to a criminal offense.  So, the correct answer to the question "have you been arrested?" is yes.  And the correct answer to "have you ever been convicted?" is also yes.  (You don't have to have a trial to be convicted, and you don't get sentenced to probation without being convicted.)    When in doubt, it's a good idea to just ask the probation officer.  You definitely would not want your probation officer finding out you've lied on an application, etc.    Now, if this is a deferred prosecution situation then the answer to the question "have you ever been convicted of crime?" is no.  And this is the absolute truth.  As long as you fulfill the terms and requirements, charges will be dismissed and there will never be a conviction on your record.|`|0eFSeap5aa	Depends    If it is unlikely the person asking would find out, then just say no.    If they would eventually find out, then it is a choice between being upfront versus buying time.    If you only need a temporary situation, say no, and let them find out.    Otherwise follow the Kissinger doctrine, that which must be eventually disclosed should be immediately disclosed.|`|oFcrglxzaa	only the honest ones answer yes to that question and that's why they never get anywhere in this world, answer no, let them find out, they may never and you could be living the good life

I think they call it "lack of motivation" and it's worse than failing.    Your peers could vote you out or your instructors could just tell you you are done.  Do your best, that's all you can do.   You can retry, but it wont be right away.  You will get sent to your unit, and it will be up to them when/if you go back.  You could deploy in the meantime, or have other trainings that could push back your re-try to over a year.|`|5TTZCXMxaa	you should really just join regular army first and then transfer later if you want to, but if your serious about it then you can:  keep up a high fitness level  get some shooting practice  etc.    you can retry if you want but Rangers is almost impossible if you arent already in the army and had that training.  GOOD LUCK|`|XAuubjXpaa	Hey man if you wash out you can retry but you'll be thrown in infantry. If you don't mind infantry then go ahead with the Option 40 contract. But if you don't want to be in infantry then go in as the MOS you want with airborne in your contract and you can volunteer for Ranger School when you get to your duty station. You'll have to pass RIP which isn't as tough as Ranger School and then about a year later you go to Ranger School.(You have to wait about a year whether you get the option 40 contract or not. You have to prove yourself to your ranger battallion.) Then after Ranger School, you are a Ranger though you may not be assigned to a Ranger battallion.

ymNM6mmzaa	The Army primarily recruits people for Cat IV language training, that is why the minimum DLAB score to become a 35W is 105.    I am not an Arabic linguist, but I wish I was.  You will deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan no matter what language you learn, so you might as well learn Arabic, Farsi, Dari, Urdu, Pashto, etc. and be useful.    The Army still does train Russian, Chinese, and Korean, plus a few Spanish, French, and German (German is VERY rare); so there are some options other than Arabic.    Also, if you start out learning Arabic, and have trouble in the course; the Army may offer you the opportunity to try an easier language.  Several students in my Russian class had started out in Arabic or Korean.      Feel free to email me if you have any more questions.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	Dont learn classical arabic. Nobody speaks it in real life, and it has lead to thousands of innocent people killed because of variations in the nuances. Slang has taken over language.     It is even more extreme than american speech 150 years ago compared to today's slang.|`|NsFfTYNpaa	dont do it.|`|FsnBRBTpaa	depends on how well you do on the DLPT (defense language proficiency test) .     I think studying Russian and a romance language helps - learning two styles of languages.     do your best on the test and then argue your case that you don't want Arabic-  its not so bad compared to Chinese or Japanese, at least it has an alphabet.       All branches of the Services have linguists, I think the Air  Force or Navy will treat you better in general.      Also, they do train all the linguists in Arabic several different dialects, not just Modern Standard Arabic, but you have to start with the basics.      Good luck

People used to pull their children closer to them when I walked by too.  Very sad because I LOVE children and would never harm one!  I have my own son (and another baby on the way) now and have gotten mostly away from the whole goth thing and people are more accepting of me now.

Form I-290B may only be completed by the affected party. The "affected party" means the person or entity with legal standing in a proceeding. It does not include the beneficiary of a visa petition. It is used to notify USCIS that the signer is filing a motion to reopen or reconsider a USCIS decision or appealing an adverse decision regarding his/her case.    An appeal filed by a person or entity not entitled to file it must be rejected as improperly filed. In such a case, any filing fee the Service has accepted will not be refunded.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Do you have any flying time?  That would be very helpful.  Also, not puking is good.  I'm being completely serious, more than one fighter-pilot wannabe changed his/her mind after power-chunking in a contact ride.  You need to READ and STUDY as much as possible before each ride.  Being fully prepared will impress your instructors, AND increase your confidence.  Which in turn will also impress your instructors.  What you instructors look for is a guy who can think at 11 miles/minute. Someone who's completely comfortable in the air, and the cockpit environment (there are fewer people who fit this than one might believe.)  If they ask what you want to fly, don't be shy-fighter pilots aren't by nature.  Be straight up with them, they'll be straight up with you. If you say, "well i'll be happy with anything" they will assume that's exactly the case, and you'll end up in a path that needs crews-not necessarily the path you want.  Finally, do NOT talk/brag about said flying time, your great experiences in Microsoft Flight Sim etc.  PO'ing your instructors is not where you wish to be.

(1) A foreign national is inadmissible on health grounds if their health condition    (a) is likely to be a danger to public health;    (b) is likely to be a danger to public safety; or    (c) might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services.    Exception  (2) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply in the case of a foreign national who    (a) has been determined to be a member of the family class and to be the spouse, common-law partner or child of a sponsor within the meaning of the regulations;    (b) has applied for a permanent resident visa as a Convention refugee or a person in similar circumstances;    (c) is a protected person; or    (d) is, where prescribed by the regulations, the spouse, common-law partner, child or other family member of a foreign national referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (c).    If there are unpaid medical bills, I would assume this person is in Canada under a visitor visa and yes, they can remove this person for that reason.
BgwTxzEFaa	Constitution doesn't require Presidents or other federal officials to place their hand on the Bible or say the words "so help me God." Quite the contrary, those sections of the Constitution that deal with oaths of office are completely secular in content and, as such, constitute evidence that the framers intended separation.    The Presidential oath of office is described in Article II, section 1 of the Constitution:          Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

kXMXbGhOaa	From my understanding, the US is borrowing money from China. As part of some trade agreement, the US is allowing China to import and export goods without paying or paying smaller taxes on said goods. An additional part of this agreement, Congress put into law that US Citizens must use those new mercury filled florescent bulbs to be more green (but due to the heavy metals they are more hazardous to the environment if they break), the bulbs are only made in China. Congress is setting the stage to sell off America to foreign governments. This idea is not new, for instance, France had major holdings in the US Government during and after the Revolutionary War, but $819 Billion dollars is excessive. If we are not careful, we as a country will never "own" it in our lifetime.     As a point of historical fact, a country that is severely in debt to another nation and cannot afford it's military always fails and get defeated.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	I would say higher taxes are on their way....either that or he will just print it in Fantasy Land...like most lib ideas|`|7HKTDcvYaa	There will be treasury bills sold to raise the money. Most of the money then will be taken out of the economy to be spent back into it.    When we have lack of liquidity, we would ordinarily not want to be selling a lot of bonds that would soak up investor money, but that is what we will do, lenc money to the banks then sell bonds so that there will be less money available for deposit in the banks.    The banks of course needed to have raised more equity capital too. to have stability. This too will be made more difficult by sale of treasury bonds in this scale.

rYNM67oyaa	How do I become a Coast Guard pilot?     You must first be a Coast Guard officer or a graduate of another armed service's flight school with active duty pilot experience.  Prior military pilots may apply for direct commission aviator positions.     Commissioned officers in the Coast Guard may apply for flight school and will be placed on a school waiting list once accepted.    Qualifications:    Flight school candidates must pass a Class 1 Flight Physical. A dental exam will check for cavities and other problems that may be affected by changes in air pressure during flight.    Vision requirements are also very stringent. Eyesight should be 20/20 or correctable to 20/20, no exceptions. Uncorrected visual acuity must be better than 20/200 in either eye. There are other limitations imposed based on the type and strength of the lens prescription. In addition, normal color perception, depth perception and field of vision are required.    http://www.gocoastguard.com/find-your-fi...|`|AA11598520	Yes.

Most countries, including the USA, turned a blind eye to it because it was thought only to be infecting gay men at the time.   10 years later, the harsh reality came to light that it had been spreading through the entire population with impunity.    Had they acted from the start HIV would be a footnote not pandemic.

Plus, the so called benefits of this new spending won't even be realized until 2017...at least that is what some of the most intelligent economist's in our country, and others, project. if you knew anything about economics, you'd realize that creating/saving jobs first and foremost is the most important peice to reestablishing our economy, and vital to halting/slowing our decent now. unfortunately, unemployment is expected, and approaching, to meet or beat unemployment rates of some of the worst recessions in our nations history. it will be comperable to what we say in the Great Depression. granted, there are millions more in our nation today to even out the %'s, but that doesn't mean it isn't bleak. do you believe everything you hear on the E Channel, or do you actually do some research of your own and formulate an intelligable opinion/position? juuust a question...|`|SXeEvt9Qaa	Teekno, you are an idiot!!

AA11156037	Yes, but you better like the desert, amigo!    29 Stumps is your destination.       Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 3 (VMU-3) is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) squadron in the United States Marine Corps that operates the RQ-7 Shadow. They are based out of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California and it's primary mission is to provide aerial surveillance for the I Marine Expeditionary Force. The unit also (in conjunction with VMU-1, also based at Twentynine Palms) provides Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) to units participating in Mojave Viper, an exercise held several times a year on the base. The squadron, nicknamed the Phantoms, was activated on September 12, 2008 and falls under the command of Marine Air Control Group 38 and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing .    VMU-3 is the third UAV unit in the Marine Corps established to provide reconnaissance and assist with deployments and training of ground units. A third of the UAV Operators from VMU-1 and VMU-2 were reassigned to VMU-3 to provide the foundation for the new squadron. VMU-3 will reach a size of nearly 200 Marines in late 2009. In late September 2008, VMU-3 successfully flew the Shadow 200 UAV for the first time, and continues to fly missions in support of Mojave Viper and other exercises on a regular basis.

Only 12% of the stimulus is actually stimulus related. Check it out here.    .     Dozen Fun Facts About the House Democrats' Massive Spending Bill    1. The House Democrats' bill will cost each and every household $6,700 additional debt, paid for by our children and grandchildren.    2. The total cost of this one piece of legislation is almost as much as the annual discretionary budget for the entire federal government.    3. President-elect Obama has said that his proposed stimulus legislation will create or save three million jobs. This means that this legislation will spend about $275,000 per job. The average household income in the U.S. is $50,000 a year.    4. The House Democrats' bill provides enough spending - $825 billion - to give every man, woman, and child in America $2,700.    5. $825 billion is enough to give every person living in poverty in the U.S. $22,000.    6. $825 billion is enough to give every person in Ohio $72,000.    7. Although the House Democrats' proposal has been billed as a transportation and infrastructure investment package, in actuality only $30 billion of the bill - or three percent - is for road and highway spending. A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office said that only 25 percent of infrastructure dollars can be spent in the first year, making the one year total less than $7 billion for infrastructure.    8. Much of the funding within the House Democrats' proposal will go to programs that already have large, unexpended balances. For example, the bill provides $1 billion for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which already have $16 billion on hand. And, this year, Congress has plans to rescind $9 billion in highway funding that the states have not yet used.     9. In 1993, the unemployment rate was virtually the same as the rate today (around seven percent). Yet, then-President Clinton's proposed stimulus legislation ONLY contained $16 billion in spending.    10. Here are just a few of the programs and projects that have been included in the House Democrats' proposal:    $650 million for digital TV coupons.  $6 billion for colleges/universities - many which have billion dollar endowments.  $166 billion in direct aid to states - many of which have failed to budget wisely.  $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.  $400 million for "National Treasures."  11. Almost one-third of the so called tax relief in the House Democrats' bill is spending in disguise, meaning that true tax relief makes up only 24 percent of the total package - not the 40 percent that President-elect Obama had requested.    12. $825 billion is just the beginning - many Capitol Hill Democrats want to spend even more taxpayer dollars on their "stimulus" plan.|`|TMb076n6aa	I sure hope we little people get a piece of the pie. that money was nice to start my fruit orchard so in case of an emergency  i can help my fellow man.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Well, it's definitely in the big guy's hands now. SO it's more like spending to me. Who cares about the little guy? Nobody! This is a rude awakening for the obots but I fear the dramomine from the kool aid hasn't totally worn itself out. They's still sleepin' most of 'em!|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	That's more accurate.  Calling it a "stimulus package" gives people the impression it's supposed to stimulate the economy. It wouldn't occur to most people to take it as "stimulating" a deeper, longer recession.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	Has it been passed yet, i was following it earlier, but i found that all Republicans and about 7 democrats voted against it.

A BILLION for ACORN? The fraudulent mismanaged scam-voter activist organization? Why the HELL should I even bother voting if at 8:01 AM someones already voted in my name and by noon a dozen fake names voted with my address? Milwaukee voter lists showed I voted in the last 5 elections from my old address (I cant get my name removed, its IMPOSSIBLE) and I know damned well noones living there because its vacant and I havent sold the house yet! What are the odds the fake names voted for obama? I bet 100%    This is nothing but a test to see how stupid we really are. Getting obama elected was the first stupidity test.    The next will be how many blame it on Bush after the  4 years of obama dont work.    America; hijacked by criminals, liars, fools, and asshats. All liberal.
3OCx9lsOaa	The typhoon (or eurofighter) is the only aircraft to date that can pull and sustain 9Gs constantly without the pilot dying!  So with the right pilot it should be the best!    The right pilot would be from the RAF!    Ha Ha Ha!  Marine pilot??  Ha Ha Ha!    RAF pilots land on aircraft carriers that are 300feet long not half a mile!  They have to have at least five A+ qualifications before they can even think of applying for the job!  Their pretty good at identifying friendly aircraft too!  Who do you think trains your Top Guns???  F-cking Marines?????  Their cannon fodder!  You guys watch too many of your own movies!    Here's an example!  America faught in Vietnam!  The UK faught an identical war in Malayia!  I can't remember if it was Rosevelt that told Edward Heath to bomb the hell out of them and Heath said thats not how we brits do it!  How many thousand Americans died in Vietnam???  In Malayia the brits lost 137 and we won!|`|jtPzPhHCaa	Best - F22 Raptor.    The Grippen could hold it's own against the Typhoon (Eurofighter) which, according to military experts, was basically outclassed by the F22 before it got off the drawing board.|`|N5ncEyI0aa	i dont know but i do know that the Swede have the hottest girls in the world.|`|AA11623778	Considering the fact that the Gripen is a 4.5 generation aircraft that came out in 1987, probably not. The F-22 is a 5th generation fighter aircraft. The Gripen is comparable to the F/A-18E Superhornet.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Which ever fighter has a Marine pilot would prevail.|`|YNEmoC7Eaa	Well its a lot more complicated than just saying what aircraft is better. In terms of avionics and equipment, the F-22 is far superior than the Grippen. Also you have to take into account how experienced the pilot is. There have been multiple instances that a lesser experienced pilot lost a dog fight to a more experienced pilot in an aircraft with lesser capabilities.     With that said, If there were two pilots equally skilled and one was in and F-22 and the other in a Grippen, then Grippen would most likely loose the dog fight. The F-22 has a long range targeting system that gives it a upper hand, it is also has stealth technology and can reach very high speeds in a very short time.     As for most of the other aircraft listed they are all very good and capable aircraft that in comparison are better than the Grippen. The only other two aircraft of the last generation that are capable of taking on an F-22 is the F-18 and the F-15. Also, the Russian Su-37 is a very modern and capable aircraft but is still considered last generation.    The other next Generation aircraft that is making a lot of noise and is in terms of stealth capabilities and equipment capabilities, close to that of the F-22's is the F-35. The F-35 JSF ( Joint Strike Fighter) is being built by many international partners but is lead by Lockheed Martin. It is a very capable aircraft and many countries including Canada, the UK , US, Turkey and Australia are all looking in to buying the F-35.    In all the Grippen is a very capable aircraft but compared to it's predecessors it doesn't make the cut.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	The Eurofighter is by far the best warplane. It is the only jet fighter which can do aerobatics at supersonic speeds.      http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=8JXOssmp5I...

Stealth and avionics are what matter. But the F22 thrust vectoring aids it, though its wings are rather flimsy.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Only the latest Mig stands any chance of tackling an F22.  The latest F22 is stealthy, fast, and can lock on and fire missiles from farther away than most aircraft can even realize it is being targeted.  The Saab wouldn't know what hit it.

mT6b7INZaa	Clintons was more successful by far.    Reagan did nothing to curtail government spending.  What he did was BORROW AND SPEND CONSERVATISM ...an act of political expedience.   He cut taxes but spending quardupled while he was president.  How did Reagan pay for it ???  He did by borrowing money from foriegn investors - principally Japan.  To be fair, Reagan had to deal with Democratic leadership in congress and he wouldn't have been able to have his military spending initiatives if he vetoed and quashed his opponents.      Reagan  blustered about the need for a balanced budget, but he never ever submitted one to Congress.     The huge budget deficits that resulted caused a recession during George HW  Bushes presidency.  Bush 1 was forced to raised taxes  which led to the election of Clinton.     Clinton's economic leadership was superb.  The Bush 1 tax hikes  led to Budget surpluses which Clinton wanted to use to build schools, make infrastructure improvements and give tax relief to the middle class.   But Clinton put good policy ahead of politics when Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan & his Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin convinced him to pay down the crushing national debt that Reagan saddled us with .     The result was the greatest private sector led bull market economies in recorded history.  To be fair again, Clinton had to deal with Republican leadership in congress - but  - he was the only President to submit a balance budget to Congress since Kennedy.   I am 54 and I don't think I will ever see America as shiny and pretty as I did during the Clinton years.      What a shame that Bush took the beautiful nation that Clinton left him and trashed it like a drunken frat boy.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	I'll take Reagan.  He created the largest peace-time growth in the economy in our nation's history.  Clinton was the beneficiary of a massive boom in computer and internet technology.|`|otYOxmnuaa	They both spent too much.      Reagan got the upswing out of a trough and so did Clinton.    I don't believe in Reagan's disregard for the amount of debt we owe and I certainly don't like Clinton's approach of taxing the rich to pay for bloated and inefficient programs.    How about we remain cognizant of our debt -- reduce the burden on the very entities that create jobs (discourage outsourcing) - promote a message of self-sufficiency and individual responsibility -- too much to ask?    It's called an economic business cycle.    Trough - expansion - peak - contraction - trough - expansion - peak|`|3uH441n3aa	Reagan was trickle down-Clinton was trickle down on the blue dress|`|BIQrsl4paa	Reagan's, he got us out of Jimmy Peanuts fiscal nightmare. Clinton just rode on the coattails of Reagan/Bush 41 and took all the credit.|`|JQwL50JMaa	Reagan, definitely.  Look at how bad the economy was when he took office.  The Carter administration policies were a nightmare.  The 80s saw a huge influx of young, self-made millionaires and billionaires.  We reduced the government and had a stable economy for those 8 years.    The economy WAS good during the Clinton administration, but people are giving him too much credit.

Clinton tried to keep the Republican Congress from cutting taxes but they were able to override his veto.

rkRIYxi2aa	The GOP have a huge problem.  As you say, we're here, in this deep nasty hole because of their policies and for this they were decisively defeated in the polls.  Now the Democrats, led by our new president, are proposing radical solutions on Gitmo, torture, diplomacy and most especially on the economy.  The GOP somehow has to appear relevant but of course has no clue as to what to do.  John Boehner, whose political life hangs by a thread, keeps popping up like a stage villian to denounce whatever has been proposed, but for him this is King Canute land.  Obama is being excessively kind to them, visiting with them on the Hill, pretending to believe how important their support is and so forth, but bottom line, he holds the winning hand and they know it.  An unpleasant and well deserved position to be in.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	Anyone who at this late date that bothers making a list of what the OTHER party did, without acknowledging congressional voting or what this entire government has become, is just another person who is not willing to accept just how horrible things are. It's not a ******* game, yet you play it like it is. Your one-sided list means nothing except that you won't care if "your team" does the same, as long as your team does it, and they did, check the voting records. Look at what "your team" did during the 90s and then look at the voting record for the Iraq War and the Patriot Act I and II. And you definitely need to learn about economics, if you can think objectively long enough.    A stimulus package has just been proposed, by the party you fail to mention, which is traitorous beyond belief. During a time of extreme weakness and vulnerability for this country, those guys just pushed through the most corrupt pile of agenda-ridden crap that has NOTHING to do with helping this country. The people who have taken over this party are now taking over the country. Can't you see that? Just like the people who took over the Republican party did? Haven't you noticed how busy they are? Doesn't that worry you? Have you been paying attention? Christ, both parties have been infiltrated by freaks and people want to keep playing the game. It sucks having to live in this world with so many people desperate for an identity. Gee, you hate Republicans, congrats.

The GOP these days simply looks out for wealthy and religious freak constituents.|`|G7SmEfLdaa	Well first of all, pretty much all of our economic woes stem from inflation and the war.  And i'll go ahead and blame the GOP for the war in Iraq, (not so much for Afghanistan, as that was caused most likely by the general world hatred of us for our interventionist foreign policy, Israel, Kosovo, Iraq, Kuwait etc.). There is no pattern, because unless you've been in a cave for the past 3 years, the democrats have been passing these bills in congress.  The two parties are both ideologically authoritarian in nature, giving unregulated money to the banks from the taxpayer's wallet.  The Bailout (that the democrats were in complete support, most of the republicans were skeptical, as they should have been) was doomed to fail from the beginning, as you can't fix inflation and debt with spending.  The problem is, the democrats are screwing up as bad as the Republicans did, making all the same mistakes.  Obama is continuing the interventionist foreign policy that put is in the hole economically in the first place, Obama is not letting these corporations that have overstepped their boundaries fail, when they need to file bankruptcy protection and modify their business plans rather than just getting huge checks.  I don't know about Rush Limbaugh, but honestly, both of the parties are remarkably similar. Many people considered McCain a third bush term, honestly I don't think Obama is doing things a whole lot differently than he would have, making all of the election drama pointless.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	well you fail to mention the barney franks and ted Kennedy's were a big part of the failure of banking and mortgages.|`|98421d53b33baefb6c27a02dbf2c57b8aa	I love how all you little dems. bring up Rush Limbaugh In every question these past few days.I just find It too funny!|`|3MM64geHaa	If spending was the answer we would all be doing great. Bush spent and spent as did his Democratic controlled congress.  You can't spend your way out of recession. The financial problems happened bc of the housing/credit crash which happened bc of Carter and Clinton and the Dems refusal to listen to Bush or McCain when they were concerned about Fannie and Freddie.     Congress--the Dem lead congress gave the money to the banks unregulated!!! And they want to continue to do ridiculous bailouts.

sdNArv1Raa	Look if you join the National guard or Army you are going to deploy. If you want to be a Civil Engineer then go to work for some one that will pay you. If you join as an Officer you degree dose not place you automatically in the Engineers. You could be in the Field Artillery, Inelegance, and so on it goes by the needs of the Army or the State Guard you go in to. Having an AGR job does not keep you from deploying and could even cause you to go more often. Unless you are put in a Combat Engineer company or some other combat Arms MOS you will likely just be a FOBit, convoy escort, or something simple. Not every one kicks in doors! It is not as bad as you see on CNN or MSNBC try Fox news one day and get a better account of the Wars. If you are opposed to them you would best serve you country by not joining. If you dont want to Deploy Don't join.  The difference between the Guard and the Army is the Guard is state funded and the Army is federal your state can be activated for service as the President sees fit. When Activated the Guard Falls under Dept. of the Army and funds are from the Army.   Sorry to be blunt but the Army or guard does not need an other Democrat that wants to say they served just because it will help there future, if you do not wish to deploy JUST DONT JOIN.  The Guard has always deployed in every war some units stayed home but some went, the Army will only deploy a certen % of the State's guard|`|RfxQJU4Xaa	I've said this before. If your worried about being deployed then dont join.

Good luck|`|4Gxurdtzaa	Will,    Whatever they promise you...make sure its on your contract. You will be safe on deployment based on your training time, level of deployment of your assigned ANG Unit, and field you specialize in...by the way your field education-wise is highly desired in deployment...    In short, continue seeking pros and cons...interviewing those who have been in, family's stand-point, gut-instinct, and educated advice.    Best of Luck!|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	You sound like a prime candidate for the "Hey I hafta deploy?" award. There is no job that is not deploy able. Even the Army Corps of Engineers are deployed. What you seek is not feasible in the modern Guard. I would say that perhaps, if you are opposed to deploying, that you rethink joining up.|`|55GNtviDaa	First of all the Guard is a state run program, they pay the Army to train them, the Guard is owned by the state that you join in, yes you can transfer states with permission from that state.   If you enlist in the Guard, Reserves and want to be a engineer you need to be specific with the recruiter of what you want. If the recruiter is good and is willing to work with you to get you a spot(job) in which ever you choose you might have to drive to be in that spot.   The biggest thing I would recommend to you is, if you know what you want DO NOT let the recruiter or the guidance consouler convince you to take something that you don't want, stand your ground and make them give you what you want. If they want you, they will find a way to get you what you want.  If you get the job you want then you will do that job, depending on the type of unit that you are in. If you are in a Infantry Battalion then, you can figure that out. If you are in a Engineering Battalion then.... Just remember to don't let them persuade you to do something that you don't want to do. And going from enlisted to officer is not as hard as they make it out to be, but in the Reserves and Guard there has to be position for that job in order for them to fill it. If you went enlisted first, if you can go officier later. Talking to the officiers in the unit that you get, they will help you. Just remember times are hard, the recruiters aren't going to tell you everything unless you ask, so any and all questions you have, write them down and then go talk to them.   Good luck!

N7G26k4Iaa	Two reasons:  US is freaked out by having a communist country so close.  Better lobbying by Cuban emigres in FL.|`|AA12365543	Because the US guaranteed any Cuban who could touch the US mainland will be given refugee status.  Haitians were not under the ONLY Communist regime in the Americas in the 60s.      Why don't Haitians make there country better instead of begging?  After all they were the ones who chose to break from France only to turn Haiti into a third world slum hole while Frances other Caribbean colonies thrive.|`|lZe1daRAaa	All n'i ' g ' ga s from cuba or Haiti are deported and sent back because both are illegal commie immigrants , not welcomed in USA

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	YES, I would be surprised.  So far, President Obama seems to be working in a bipartisan fashion. I didn't vote for him, but he seems to have a level of integrity and class we haven't seen in 16 years.    What would NOT surprise me is when things go further in the tank is the DNC trots out talking heads like Paul Begala, Donna Brazille, and OTHERS to blame President Bush.    CONGRESS is still the ROOT of all the problems...     I'm a Conservative Independent, and tired of all the children here who have to rant, curse, or just be ignorant.|`|bmCInR5qaa	Straw man fallacy.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Bush was blamed for everything (including the weather) while in office.

The democrats historically blame everybody but themselves when their pie in the sky schemes fail, so why should this boondoggle be any different.    Edit: I just hope the republicans remind him who won when it all falls in the crapper.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Why not. Everything else that has gone wrong Bush was blamed.    One must wonder when is the individual going to step up and claim their part in the down fall.     When things were booming the average citizen was spending everything they made, had several credit cards maxed out and floating loans to make payments. Most never considered putting anything back for hard times.    Now the hard times are here they don't know what to do and expect those who did put something back to bail them out so they can get back to what they were doing.     That is called Liberalism.|`|3GXYel3Kaa	I know it's easy to think that way, since Mr. Bush tried to pass his own failed policies off on the Clinton administration, but frankly not all people think that way.  He's a man whose more than likely to own up to his failures.  Are you man enough to own up to his successes, should they happen?    As Harry S Truman said, "The buck stops here."  Shame that Mr. Bush never learned that.  Perhaps you will.    Cheers.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I'm a Republican for better reasons than merely (Hooray for my side,) but I would be surprised.  I don't recall Bush doing that and I can't imagine Obama doing that either.  For all their many differences, I believe that they are both honorable men.|`|158BjrKbaa	Not in the least.|`|pAVfFAe2aa	No, not at all.    He told us all, HE knows what to do when he was trying to get elected.  Then he starts the "this is going to take some time" stuff.      He wanted us to have confidence in him, and now I wonder just how much of a mistake he is looking like.    Closing Gitmo when there isn't a plan on where to take the terrorists seems more like a knee jerk reaction to pander to his extreme liberal base.    He said "No Pork" in the bailout (he has reworded it; it's now the "recovery")  and then it comes PACKED with pet pork projects.    He spoke of change in DC and then look at all the career politicians.  He speaks of ethics, then nominates tax cheats and others with questionable practices.    He speaks of bi-partisan politics, then only confers with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to write the megaPork "recovery" package.  The booze and schmooze party was intended as mere eyewash.    The libbers are trying to bogart the transfer of wealth to as many as they can - and as fast as they can before WE know what is in it!    And when it fails, watch'em all line up and blame George Bush.....|`|9NVexqv6aa	He'll try but that **** aint flying sorry!|`|9523a69f8f56f7ee9c150d9a76bdb9efaa	Obama knows Bush has nothing to do with the stimulus plan.

History will show that this man is one of the worst Presidents the US has ever had.|`|AA10928202	I feel anything but safe.|`|XQQ6ELVpaa	It's a fact that if he sticks to what he said he would do, our country, maybe even other parts of the world could benifit. I hope he doesnt let us down. Its all trust now.|`|MYjAhq4Paa	I'm sure there are millions of people who dislike him...for whatever reason.  That just comes with the territory.  I don't feel any less safe with him than I did with any other president since Nixon.  And I was clueless as to who he was, lol.  I was too young to remember Nixon and Ford.  I was in the fifth grade when Carter lost to Reagan, so I remember that very well. Still, I felt safe with them all.|`|2vUOqAikaa	I am very happy with Obama as my President. It is my honest prayer that he does a good job in getting our country out of this economic disaster. Whether you like him or not is irrelevant. Everyone is in the same boat together. He can't fell. We all need to stand behind him and lend him our support. For if we fail the consequences will be most severe.|`|3QELIOU7aa	I dont like the guy he is a poser and a fraud.
HnEcgVGiaa	Basically you have to request a cross-military transfer. I don't know how the Marine commanders will respond to this... (Marines sometimes look down upon the Army - as being weak). But this isn't true! The U.S. Army is respectable and strong. He should also try checking in with the U.S. Army Recruiting office and tell them his situation.    The Army deploys whenever there's a Presidential Order or an order from a general. The U.S. Government is seeking to deploy several thousands of troops to Afghanistan, however, in the coming months. But the good news is that the forces in Iraq are on the decline.|`|KC0f4u7oaa	Of course the army deploys!  Generally the deployments are about a year to year and a half.  Don't think the BS will not be present in the Army as well.  He should check out the blue to green progam on goarmy.com|`|kxSz1PYmaa	We have a lot of friends that have transitioned from the marines to the army and have done very well.  Not sure what MOS he is looking for but that will have an impact on deployments.  One big difference between deployments is that the Armys is typically 12-15 months and I believe the Marines only go for 7 months at a time.  Good luck!    Haha Lee, I agree with what you said about how the marines look at the army, but it also is the same way with how the army looks at the "jarheads".  Nothing wrong with rivalry.

SQxiGhz5aa	Don't have a problem with stem cell research.  DO have a problem with government funded research.    They still have private funding.  That never stopped.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Religious dogma tells them.  That's all.    Today, not one child or foetus or embryo need be harmed in the extraction of stem cells.  So that argument is gone.|`|BsQcplTQaa	Adult stem cell research has come up with a wide range of usable cures. And I support it completely. On the other hand Embryonic cell research has come up with nothing and even if it was fully funded it would take years before any usable cures are developed. If this was so promising why aren't the medical companies doing the research? The ban only stops Government funding, it has never stopped private money.|`|NQYKzv7faa	Stem cell research is a tiny, tiny segment of medicine.  It is totally obselete.  It is only a several million dollar industry, and that is not because it is banned, because it is mostly not banned.      It is not expected to yield significant return.  You can now get stem cells from regular people.  This debate should be over.

If it's currently in that range or longer I'd have it done before you go. If you wear your hair shorter have it fixed so you don't have to fuss with it too much. You won't have time.    If you're going in any other branch of the service the same advice applies unless you have long hair and wish to wear it in a bun.|`|dwt1sidtaa	You can keep it long!    You'll have to keep it up (in a bun) while you are in uniform.  You'll get a chance to get it cut at the base salon while you are at bootcamp (if you are Air Force).|`|sdNArv1Raa	here are some excerpts from the Army reg AR 670-1    a. Hair.  (1) General. The requirement for hair grooming standards is necessary to maintain uniformity within a military  population. Many hairstyles are acceptable, as long as they are neat and conservative. It is not possible to address every  acceptable hairstyle, or what constitutes eccentric or conservative grooming. Therefore, it is the responsibility of  leaders at all levels to exercise good judgment in the enforcement of Army policy. All soldiers will comply with the  hair, fingernail, and grooming policies while in any military uniform or while in civilian clothes on duty.  Females will ensure their hair is neatly groomed, that the length and bulk of the hair are not excessive, and that  the hair does not present a ragged, unkempt, or extreme appearance. Likewise, trendy styles that result in shaved  portions of the scalp (other than the neckline) or designs cut into the hair are prohibited. Females may wear braids and  cornrows as long as the braided style is conservative, the braids and cornrows lie snugly on the head, and any hairholding  devices comply with the standards in 18a(3)(d) below. Dreadlocks (unkempt, twisted, matted individual parts  of hair) are prohibited in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty. Hair will not fall over the eyebrows or extend below  the bottom edge of the collar at any time during normal activity or when standing in formation. Long hair that falls  naturally below the bottom edge of the collar, to include braids, will be neatly and inconspicuously fastened or pinned,  so no free-hanging hair is visible  Females will ensure that hairstyles do not interfere with proper wear of military headgear and protective masks  or equipment at any time (see 18a(1)(a), above). When headgear is worn, the hair will not extend below the bottom  edge of the front of the headgear, nor will it extend below the bottom edge of the collar|`|6yVyylqBaa	it has to be above your shoulders, but you dont get your head shaved
T0pkW783aa	Just more of the same; Dems and Libs are very into pork.  How about all the money that is in the stimulus package for that wonderful organization, Acorn (Obama's special interest group); yeah, they cheated, lied, and stole the election with no consequences for the dead, the illegals, the felons, the unregistered and the non residents who voted in masses without being subject to the law; in fact, the liberal judge who reviewed the case, dismissed those who wanted it looked into.  This type of thing will continue to take place because those who are voting for it outnumber those who aren't and the public opinion means absolutely nothing.|`|Wd5HJJqbaa	they cant question the will of the Messiah.  this stimulus package is a joke.|`|eef76b61eca737b62766034d9204c8baaa	According to a recent CNN article, other abuses of taxpayer dollars found within the report include: a proposed $20 million minor league baseball museum in Durham, North Carolina; $6.1 million for corporate jet hangars at the Fayetteville, Arkansas, airport; $20 million for renovations at the Philadelphia Zoo; and a $1.5 million program to reduce prostitution in Dayton, Ohio.    Do the O'zombies have any idea that thier children will be strapped with this SPENDING package?|`|GHHMfGD0aa	I personally think the stimulus package could have good and bad effects. Starting on the global warming thing, this was not meant for the economy in theory. Obviously, gas will run out at some point. Meaning, Americas economy will fail if we do not atart to build infrastructure for alternative fuels NOW. Furthermore, researchers say the damages of global warming will be permanat if we saty on this track in 2020. So, in order to remain financially and enviormentally sound this part of the stimulus package was neccessary. Now, the consumer part. The theory behind this is when people get money they will spend it. A mass amount of consumer dollars will directly stimulate the economy. On the other side, if consumers spend money on non-consumer goods the United States will be adding to their debt. The money spent to issue the checks will have been gone. The other part of Obama's plan is to allow people to tap into their retirement money without penalties. Usuallu when you touch your 401(k) or other retirement money you end up only getting about half of your money due to penalties and taxes. Now, if people were able to take the money out withput losing their money they would be more inclined to do so. If they spent this money on getting themselves out of debt it would benefit the economy. Debt: They would have more money to spend in the furture. Consumer Goods: More money in the economy.|`|nr96BgWfaa	OMG, 400 million?  wasted on pseudoscience?  which one of his pal's pockets is that money going into?    we are all in for a big ride on this one.....    making the 'stimulus' work is obviously not his priority.    no, i can't support my own destruction, thank you.|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Do you believe them when they say they didn't read it they should have been fired on the spot.

He should be hung for treason for many reasons, the least of which is the ACORN thing.|`|rB1KcztYaa	U R A FREAK!|`|ff3246ab4193235aa580f70384f57b09aa	And your candidate won because??? So what you gonna do when the almighty Obama fails this isn't a matter of democrat or republican I know of several democrats who did not vote Obama and you know he still hasn't given his views on things and he is keeping Bush tax cuts among other things  Bush did so what makes him so great other than he is the first black president whoopee|`|a5cb58a8106c34d8f182eaa2e2377a36aa	Well, I am not dem or repub, but I don't like Obama for my own reasons- And the main reason is his support of abortion, which I am 1 million percent against. I will never like him until he stops making things more difficult for pro-life people. I still cant beleive that he would have the nerve to make even pro-life tax payers pay for overseas abortions- that just disgusts me to no end- I shouldn't have to support something because im forced when I am morally against it. Just like all of the other pro-life people who feel the same way. I don't like the man, never will, didn't eversince i found out he loved abortion so much, but I will tolerate him- after all, what choice do I have? the country is blinded by him and his falseness anyways, so hes obviously not going anywhere.    OH- and lets not forget that he is not even a natural born citizen- which should have automatically disqualified him for presidency- but it didnt, and im sure the only reason is because the country didnt want to look racist for following the rules- but ofcoarse they would have, so im sure they had no choice. Its sad- people are focusing more on his being HALF black than his ability to be a good president (which he cant). This whole thing was about race and the whole inauguration was all about race- nothing about the presidency, it was a big celeb-fest...yeah- im going to love this guy like all of the idiots in hollywood who have no clue what they are talking about. *rolls eyes* mindless drones...|`|McYp8luoaa	I will never accept Obama as our president unless he does everything that he promised which is tax cuts, universal health care, better economy, ect...So far Obama has done nothing but make horrible decisions. So far he supported using our tax dollars for the auto bailout. That's bad. He also supports delaying the digital television switch. Another stupid move. OBAMA IS A JOKE.

So that other aircraft can see them and avoid a collision.|`|9NVexqv6aa	They are spying on you.  STAY INDOORS!|`|y0jL9n6Taa	They are spot lights.  The helo had spotted some one the police wanted and held his light on them until the ground troops arrived.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Every helicopter I have ever seen (at night) has blinking lights on it, with the exception of some military helicopters.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	All aircraft have red blinking lights. Even helicopters.

There was a Belgian parliamentary inquiry held in 2000, which looked at Belgian and American involvement (Congo had been a colony of Belgium).  It concluded that while the CIA was involved in the assassination plot, it was not directly responsible for his murder.  That fell to the Belgians.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	You crazy conspiracy nuts:    Ok, Eisenhower decided to off the guy, so he hired Agent 47 and some aliens to zap him into oblivion. But they crashed in Area 51. And now, if you play the shareware version of Doom 2, you can see someone on the grassy knoll.

3MM64geHaa	But it would not make the government powerful. IT would not reward those organizations that fund the Dems elections.  It would not put money into art museums, junk science, and ice skating lessons!    1. The House Democrats' bill will cost each and every household $6,700 additional debt, paid for by our children and grandchildren.    2. The total cost of this one piece of legislation is almost as much as the annual discretionary budget for the entire federal government.    3. President-elect Obama has said that his proposed stimulus legislation will create or save three million jobs. This means that this legislation will spend about $275,000 per job. The average household income in the U.S. is $50,000 a year.    4. The House Democrats' bill provides enough spending - $825 billion - to give every man, woman, and child in America $2,700.    5. $825 billion is enough to give every person living in poverty in the U.S. $22,000.    6. $825 billion is enough to give every person in Ohio $72,000.    7. Although the House Democrats' proposal has been billed as a transportation and infrastructure investment package, in actuality only $30 billion of the bill - or three percent - is for road and highway spending. A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office said that only 25 percent of infrastructure dollars can be spent in the first year, making the one year total less than $7 billion for infrastructure.    8. Much of the funding within the House Democrats' proposal will go to programs that already have large, unexpended balances. For example, the bill provides $1 billion for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which already have $16 billion on hand. And, this year, Congress has plans to rescind $9 billion in highway funding that the states have not yet used.     9. In 1993, the unemployment rate was virtually the same as the rate today (around seven percent). Yet, then-President Clinton's proposed stimulus legislation ONLY contained $16 billion in spending.    10. Here are just a few of the programs and projects that have been included in the House Democrats' proposal:    $650 million for digital TV coupons.  $6 billion for colleges/universities - many which have billion dollar endowments.  $166 billion in direct aid to states - many of which have failed to budget wisely.  $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.  $400 million for "National Treasures."  11. Almost one-third of the so called tax relief in the House Democrats' bill is spending in disguise, meaning that true tax relief makes up only 24 percent of the total package - not the 40 percent that President-elect Obama had requested.    12. $825 billion is just the beginning - many Capitol Hill Democrats want to spend even more taxpayer dollars on their "stimulus" plan.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Your arithmetic is off. A billion is 1000 million. So divide 819,000 million by 306 and you get $2,676 per person. You'd be better using the number of tax payers - currently 189 million, but that still only gives you $5000 per person.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Don't you think that's just further proof of what I've been saying all along?    The government is no longer for the people.  It is for the few that own the big companies that get the contracts to do as little as they possibly can for as much as they can get.    I guarantee you 5% of that money will find it's way back to the election war chests of those who vote for it.  And another 10% will go towards convincing you to keep doing the things you're doing - spending all your money and voting for people who give your tax dollars to these companies.    Half of it will go towards making it look like they're doing something and the rest will go right into the pockets of those who profit the most from all this - the ultra rich.    That's how they became ultra rich in the first place.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Um, no we wouldn't....we would each get about 2,676.00.   A decent amount of  money.....that MOST of us would use to pay off bills and put into savings/IRA's/etc.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	You may want to check that arithmetic.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	its better just to work hard and save your own money|`|ma0u2CUNaa	it sure would that would make everyone rich but ppl would probably quit thier jobs 2mil is enough|`|A2qbzxrfaa	This grandiose Democrat spending plan is not going to stimulate our economy. It is, however, going to fulfill decades of Democrat dreams and schemes. It will make government more powerful. It will weaken the private sector. It will insure the reelection of Democrat officeholders for years to come. It will inevitably lead to massive tax cuts which will harm, if not destroy, American private sector productivity. It will absolutely change the way your children and grand children live their lives. It will rob them of opportunity and lock them into a life of mediocrity in service to the all-powerful Imperial Federal Government of the United States.|`|ff3246ab4193235aa580f70384f57b09aa	Yeah, but since we have no say in the matter which is a load of B.S. since we are the ones who put the idiots there now look what they are doing and think of how this will effect our future generations. This isn't all going to be paid out this year if you have heard anything about the bill it is more of a promise keeper from the mighty one than a stimulus bill. I say we take our country back and fire everyone of those politicians before we are so deep in debt  our kids' kids are paying for it|`|A7qDWyTYaa	You need you a new calculator--you are so far off it isn't even funny.  I'd tell you by exactly how much, but it will stick with you longer if you do the math.  You're going to be very embarrassed.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Would you be using the term billion in a european sense?  I think Americans will see this as closer to 4000 dollars per person.    Well, a lot of spending would take place, but also a lot of debt repayment and investment, a lot of buying foreign goods.    So perhaps it might not have accomplished what was wanted.  But again perhaps no spending plan would accomplish that.|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Sure dream big if your going to dream it will not help us its to break us then enslave us.|`|fQgbBx7caa	You had better not get into doing anybodies taxes for them, if you get a stimulus check you had better buy a new calculator.|`|f75250e72b460f158a3744cbbf8d9c1aaa	if you take the ACTUAL math, as the other people have noted here, and give us 2,676 each, and then figure that the average american has 8,000 in credit card debt at an interest rate of 20%, that makes us all, STILL BROKE.    Maybe you should do math for congress however, because I'd love a 2 million dollar check.|`|tmAkcfnLaa	i think that the money should go to each and ever tax paying american citizen, by the way of income tax.  this year i made 62k, after federal taxes, i only 45k.  where is my money going, to the chinese?  most likely not.  it is going straight into the pockets of people who surely dont need any more money, rich lobbyists.
