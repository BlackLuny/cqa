I'm thinking:  Still keep in mind that s0me s0o`,contracts are meant to be broken !! urthermore there are so0 very many people involved when it comes to some contract !!... Yess you'd better trust that  some that discovered this newly found technique or way to ROB from some certain level or way... I`ll bet has done away with with damning evidence !!  "In`order to have a chance of revealing anything at all... Would be to try to have info `bout the plans from the <GET/GO>~!!! a.k.a. from the start !!!  <get it> ?  as in from the momment someone said GO `' !!as`far`as`whatever is concerned or whatever the case may be !?!

"It's NOT My fAuLt that some fools want to listen to a double dose of that BUSH SH`,' uh`mm S T U FF  !!.  lol       r`'R'`r|`|vY0ScgeXaa	the assumption is almost a certainty statement. <br>  <br>  basically it assumes at least one party of the contracts must gain, i.e. even if there are 1 million losers in that contract, we still would have at least 1 winner. as long as a winner is there, the contract is based on the effort that everyone TRY to make good.<br>  <br>  so yea, it says nothing, and has absolutely no use at all. merely a word game.
3Sr2FgRfaa	These answers scare me. First, the Earth is closer to the sun than Mars -- I think Mars is nearly twice as far, in fact. Mars has no atmosphere to speak of -- 1% Earth density. <br>  <br>  That said -- the Martian icecaps show an identical pattern of melting to Earth's -- and other planets further out also show a similar pattern. There are two main theories about what causes icecap melt in this way. The first, global warming, doesn't work so well when you figure that our carbon dioxide doesn't really reach Mars. The second, sunspot patterns, would affect all planets roughly equally. <br>  <br>  Science dictates that the best theory is the one that accommodates the most evidence, with the fewest items controverting it.<br>  <br>  Ergo, sunspot-caused climate change makes about a bazillion times more sense than human-caused climate change.<br>  <br>  Of course, we can't control sunspots, and we can pretend to be in control of carbon dioxide to a certain degree. Something you can control is less scary than something you can't control. So, the global warming people choose the theory that makes them feel better. <br>  <br>  Or, in Al Gore's case, the one that scores him the most cash, fame, and adulation.|`|XqUvTCqJaa	Hahahah I love your Sarcasm!!!<br>  <br>  Well Im sure Al Gore, or some other idiot will try to say that it is with out a doubt global warming that is causing it, and if we don't stop, pluto will soon heat up and melt away as well RITFLMAO|`|iL3mNX68aa	This isn't a politics question its a science question, is it not?

Just disregard all evidence and roll the dice citing events on a planet that is 234 million miles away while ignoring what is in your own backyard. Did it occur to you to give the studies credence given the fact that if your odd hypothesis is wrong, the effects could be staggering?|`|zFsTSrOcaa	The Martian ice caps alternately shrink and expand with the seasons.  When one is melting, the other one is growing...just like earth's.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Jamie W:  The planets beyond Mars are giant planets and don't have ice caps.  Nor do their moons; if they have any ice at all, they're either encased in it or made of it, and it isn't melting.  Try again.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Yep.  Those Mars rovers can really belch out the pollution.

5axNEp8jaa	Charles Clarke was a Communist, as was David Blunket, Peter Mandelson, Peter Hain, Jack Straw, John Reid at least the last two very far to the left. May have been many more at least in the early days most Labour ministers dabbled with Marxism.<br>  David Blunket actually flew the Red Communist flag over Bradford city council hall until he was forced to take it down.<br>  Many people will try to tell you they were simply idealists. They 'knew' about the mass murders, gulags and oppression in Eastern Europe at the height of Soviet Power. They were social anarchists with the ideology of making the world one mass Proletariat, and they are running Britain now? that's grossly appalling to those who suffered at the hands of Communists.<br>  Their gross political arrogance and unaccountability shows that their Communist mentality still remains albeit under radically different ideological circumstances.<br>  Cymry is 100% correct its cultural Marxism the 3rd way.|`|fwrfIxIaaa	werent they all teachers and lesbians?|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	Good answer Jim J but I think you missed Alistair Darling.

BMbrcABWaa	Because 80% of your GDP is in the finance industry.  <br>  <br>  The US(and I assume UK as well) give loans to 3rd world countries for "redevelopment".  Redevelopment means letting US contractors to come in and build electric companies, water and sewer systems, etc.  This is making the companies who own our governments very rich.  Then the bankers who issued the loan in the first place come in and say you can't pay, Then they let them refinance so they can only afford to pay the interest on the loan and will never stop owing money. <br>  <br>  In a fiat currency system(paper money) your economy is based on debt, the more debt that is created the better the economy works(to a point.)  That's where oil comes into play.  Every country needs oil so every country trades oil.  The international bankers inflate the price of commodities through crafty trading techniques on the global market.  This is the same reason why your gas costs so much.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Taking lessons from the US.<br>  <br>  Trying to buy love.  <br>  <br>  My dad used to say, "The more you give someone, the more they hate you for not giving more".<br>  <br>  Kinda like feeding a wild bear.

EH?|`|AA11707728	Because your government is controlled by traitors who have sold you out to foriegners who hate you so much they want you all dead.<br>  <br>  That's why the BNP is becoming so powerful in the UK, despite all the harsh (and highly illegal, I might add) discrimination against them.  If you want to solve those problems, consider joining the BNP yourself.  Learn the truth about who is doing what and why.  If you work together, British citizens can put a stop to it.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	The bleeding hearts have taken over Britain , funny thing their sympathy always lays with others never their own.|`|RTVkXnavaa	u think how britain robbed so many countries thru colonisation....|`|xezI4AlNaa	because it's a lame government|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	You sound like an American citizen.  I hear you, I wish our government would wise up as well.|`|oAMyrJRtaa	Being British, you have an overwhelming sense of duty and honour. The escapades undertaken during the colonial expansion period by the Empire in Africa and Asia has lead to a collective government burden of guilt and remorse.<br>  <br>  In order to appease this crushing guilt complex, your government spends all your tax money to make themselves and you feel better, because, after all, being British, you are responsible for the empire, past and present.
3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	Disagree.  What we should do is change back to a hard currency an the Congress should issue greenbacks like they did during the civil war.

kMYE3vV8aa	I see lots of change on this website.  Gee, just a few months ago all the libs were bashing Bush and now they're on here getting mad at people bashing Obama... my, my how times have changed!<br>  <br>  And you will be spending time on here complaining like you're doing now.  You asked a very similar question about two weeks ago and here you are asking it again.  Seems it is people like you that are on here trying to stir the pot.  My advise would be if you don't like what you see then don't participate in it.  When I come across questions I don't like, I ignore them.  It really is pretty simple to do.  Each of us controls what we participate in.  It's just like TV, if you don't like a particular show then change the channel.  Everyone on here is entitled to his/her opinion, just like you, doesn't mean we have to like it or agree with it.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	who say things cannot be changed?

His key word was CHANGE! The reason these people are complaining is, these changes are not happening! OR, not as fast as they thought! so they are frustrated!!! BUT! WHO is to blame for that!?

fRCoMzXkaa	Anti-Central Banking conspiracy theorists are about the same as the anti-Freemason conspiracy theorists-off their collective nut. <br>  <br>  A central banking system is a key component to a modern, capitalist economy.|`|GL240ih0aa	Ummm... your views are very skewed. One, Andrew Jackson was possibly one of our best presidents..... he eliminated all the governments debt. He also wanted the GOVERNMENT to coin the money. This is the answer to your question. I mean what are you thinking? You think a handful of rich bankers should coin money instead of our actual government? you clearly have not researched the subject well enough, what you are saying is asinine. The solution is to give the power to coin money back to the government itself, that way it would be debt free money and would solve so many problems in the U.S. today. I mean come on, the reason we are in debt is because the central banking system creates a never ending string of debt for our government! that can only be paid off by borrowing more money from the FED. This system is crazy to anyone who knows what it does. The only reason it is in place right now is because rich bankers can buy up congressman and presidents, and do things to give them ultimate power in this country. Are you aware that money in our country right now IS debt? it is a promise to pay the federal reserve. if all debts in this country were paid, there would be no money in circulation. Still support central banking? i hope not.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	I think the best system would be a hybrid system of hard currency based on Gold, Silver, and Platinum.

Central banks represent a ruling class of elites who do things "the common man" can't understand.<br>  <br>  The banking class has ALWAYS thought that the people were too stupid to do anything unsupervised. This is why there has always been a debate about CENTRAL BANKS vs. NO CENTRAL BANKS.<br>  <br>  Hamilton wanted a central bank. Jefferson thought it was a bad idea.<br>  <br>  The question: WHY did Jefferson think it was a bad idea??<br>  <br>  You can read up on this too.<br>  <br>  As an interesting side note:<br>  <br>  Andrew Jackson HATED the idea of central banks and paper currency YET he got put on the most popular piece of paper currency in history!!! He's literally the face on the Central Bank note..........an accident, or a big fk you to anyone who dares question the banking class??<br>  <br>  EDIT: I didn't say Jackson was an economist. I was simply pointing out that it's a little odd that he, of ALL people, would be on a central bank note.

It is not known whether of not  the aim of a united Ireland still holds, but it could  still come about through demographic changes.

Not only will the sufferings of this present life fade in comparison to the glory of this new world order (Rom. 8:18), but even the most wonderful of life's experiences will be so overshadowed by our new life that they will barely survive in our memory! When the apostle John was given a vision of life in the new creation, he was so overwhelmed that he had to be reminded to record what he was witnessing (Rev. 21:5), and to be assured twice that what he was beholding would really come to pass (Rev. 21:5; 22:6)! <br>  <br>  At the end of his beloved "Narnia Tales" C.

Re9Pdfxbaa	GEORGE S;  name the countries which have gained independence from the British Empire ??? Not many ? Ireland did. !! <br>  Your ignorance does you no favours. During recent years there have been hundreds of Irish Republicans join the british army and all credit to the Army for accepting them.<br>  There was no retaliation to the killings, this week, because the forces react responsibly under the rule of law.  Cowardly killers do not wear a uniform and face you head on. <br>  The killers will be caught if the people of Northern Ireland grass them up.<br>  I am a Dubliner nothing will please me more than to see the scum cowards who murdered the British soldiers and the Ni Policeman put behind bars for the rest of their lives. The vast majority of Irish people feel the same.|`|EWsfxdhOaa	Very simple, the Brits are wimps when it comes to terrorism. These people do not listen but the government continue with its talks, what a load of crap. That army spokesman is just as bad, if terrorists are shooting you shoot back. As long as we Brits continue this namby pamby way of dealing with these scum we will lose and security personnel will die, not just in Ireland but elsewhere as well. We know who the "players" are why we just don't shoot them is beyond me. Take a leaf out of the Israeli's book and kill the lot of them. End of storey.<br>  <br>  EDIT. You cant deal with terrorists in a civilised way that's why were bloody losing. Its time for the gloves to come off and settle this once and for all. And of course you can return fire. The security forces are trained for this if they cant hit a target at that short distance they shouldnt be in the service. Bring back the good old days and send in the paras.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Ireland was in a economic boom thanks to a smart people and high tech opportunity; but that's gone bust some everywhere.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the Celt and Viking cultures in Ireland have always been unruly.  The Irish have never had the discipline of the Germanic invaders (Danish Angles and German Saxons) settled to their east.  They aren't even as ordered as their Scot cousins.<br>  <br>  Irishmen like to say if it wasn't for whiskey they would rule the world.  The Celts are smart and tough enough to -- the Germanic English have long disciplined and employed the fierce Scots as their army's backbone -- but even when the Irish are trained, passing a pub, a fight, or a football game is still stereotypically difficult for them.  They make good artists and musicians, though, when they put their mind to it.<br>  <br>  I think your question was answered, though.  It's probably better to hold back and see, rather than provoke people already looking for a brawl.<br>  <br>  I had two (one very) German grandfathers and an English and an Irish grandmother.  The German types I know don't brawl.  The stereotype is we hold back until there isn't much choice then it's finished very coldly and brutally.  Today that's no longer the style, but don't assume it isn't waiting.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	They never fired back because there has been peace for the last 12 years. The soldiers were picking up a pizza when they were ambushed.<br>  <br>  The Real IRA are terrorist scumbags, pure and simple. The UK isn't retaliating because we don't want another 30 years of all out conflict.|`|dRiBGoJkaa	They didn't retaliate because according to army spokesmen there was members of the public and military present and the risk of injuring the public was too high, fair cop.  We aren't like Israel we wont bomb n Ireland or launch a full scale assault on Belfast, we will arrest them eventually and lock em up then a few years later release them in some peace process stuff.|`|27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Ireland has not "flared up", there have been two attacks - not riots, petrol bombings, looting and huge demonstrations like there would have been 30 years ago.<br>  <br>  What has caused it is the real IRA, a tiny group of radical nobodies, who think the British will round up all the protestants and ship them off back to "where they came from" because of a couple of killings. Nobody in Northern Ireland wants to see this escalate, unless they're completely crazy.|`|uKrdjrJiaa	They could not return fire as there were several other civilians there and also other soldiers plus it was dark and so difficult to see who was who.The police did not retaliate because they were not at the army barracks and in the case of the shooting of the policeman the immediate priority would have been to save the life of the shot officer.|`|bxlYleZkaa	That is Ireland all over. Look at it's history.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	There have been two major incidents in 3 days. 2 major incidents in 12 years, in fact. The people of Northern Ireland (and the whole of Ireland) voted for peace.<br>  <br>  Civilised countries don't retaliate. They catch the criminals responsible and due process takes its course.

They simply discarded our laws.  <br>  <br>  Get something clear: we have graduates from high school and college who cannot get jobs because illegal aliens with experience are pouring into this country and taking them away from American Citizens.  We have the schools and can train anyone to do anything there is to do... the illegal aliens work for under the table wages.. or less than the common wage, and they get the jobs.  <br>  <br>  It is going to stop.  And we are talking about Britain here: if you don't like the law.. change it.  Further, if you have more people than you have jobs, then you need to find less advanced countries to take the surplus, or make sure there is not a surplus of population.  <br>  <br>  The answer is NOT to put your problem on others: it is to take care of your problem.|`|T8nap2Pnaa	He's better than you.

You only have to have the fingerprints taken once, and since that law has been in place for a while, and he has made various trips to the U.S I should think it was probably done a while back.<br>  <br>  He probably has a nicer car than you as well.  Are you going to get a chip on your shoulder about that too?|`|AA11808995	Gordon Brown would be tret as a VIP owing to his political status.No he isn't head of state that title goes to the queen.Of course he would bypass any Us immigration rules.They are aware he has to return home to cause a bit more chaos for us all.Like it or not he is a VIP.and as such has Diplomatic rights.His job is wide open at the next general election and you are entitled to apply if you wish.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	Of course not, democracy is only for the rich and powerful, us low life people just keep fooling ourselves it is an equal and just society for all of us.
AA12109395	The state of NY has no emancipation law or court proceeding to declare a minor emancipated. The court recognizes the minor as emancipated it the followings factors exist:<br>  <br>  The minor lives apart from parents<br>  The minor is self supporting<br>  The minor is not in need or receiving foster care<br>  The minor is over 16<br>  There is no financial support needed or requested from parents.<br>  <br>  If you meet the requirements, YES<br>  <br>  If not, you'll be a runaway and your parents still have legal authority over you as a minor and are responsible for your health and welfare.
AA11494150	Statistically, over 98% of police contacts involve no use of force at all. Of the remaining 2%, many of those are justified. The problem is, an officer saving someones life is barely local news, but an officer using force makes national headlines. I'll prove my point:<br>  <br>  I just went to YouTube and typed in "police brutality". The top 3 videos averaged over 1 million views each. I then typed in "police saves life" and the top 3 videos averaged only 6,000 views each. <br>  <br>  The above tells brutality is not nearly as widespread as people think, they are simply more interested in watching it.<br>  <br>  Lets look at the latest one.. .the teenager in Seattle that was assaulted in a jail cell. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmwcNaUVeUk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmwcNaUVe...</a><br>  The video went unnoticed for several months, until an officer heard someone talking about it, checked the tapes, and turned it in to his superior officer. The officer was fired and charged with assault, just because another officer brought the tape forward. Yes, there are some bad cops out there, but good cops don't like them either.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Yes.  I am tired of hearing about Police Officer getting killed in the line of duty.  These men and women have families that are left behind.  It is very sad.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	In the majority of videos I've seen, it's justified in my opinion. Especially once you learn what the "victim" was really doing.  For those rare cases of unprovoked brutality..  well, it's just not a frequent enough thing to considering it "gone too far for too long"<br>  <br>  I don't know what people think that questioning authority is the cool thing to do, but it's not.  Or at least not what the "victims" claim is questioning authority.  You can question while still remaining respectful.<br>  <br>  When I see someone involved with a crime who then runs from the police, I find it difficult to feel even a bit sorry for them if they get a good beating once caught.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	you're right....YouTube shows an accurate representation of real life. <br>  <br>  In fact, there are squirrels riding surf boards on every body of water in the world. <br>  There are millions and millions of people who can hit full court basketball shots<br>  Kids fall into gorilla pits at every zoo....every day<br>  And all cops brutalize the idiots who deserve it.<br>  <br>  grow up.|`|fdEmuBpkaa	I have to say, after living in germany for a few years, police brutality in the united states is generally tame.  <br>  <br>  If you back-talk a polizei in germany, you will get beaten for good measure.  <br>  <br>  Strangely enough, there is less crime in germany.  Hmm....|`|FpMCFvV5aa	I think people being a jerk when stopped by a police officer has gone on too long.|`|AA10553624	I am not a police officer, but had to add my nickles worth.  I do question authority every day.  Every time I ask an "officer" a question, I always get told to shut up or am TOLD that I do not know what I am talking about and that I should stop watching Law & Order.  (Which I do not watch)  I read the laws all the time so that I am not caught off guard, but to be ordered by a servant to do anything is against the law.  As an innocent.  But they do order you around like you are a criminal when they should not even be having a conversation with you.  I was charged with "Failure to Identify" because I do not know my birthday.  Then I spent 16 1/2 hours on a cement floor for this non-crime.  TX Transportation Code;  "A person commits an offence if he refuses to give name, residence, and date of birth, AFTER being Lawfully arrested".  Not sure if every word is in the right order.  By Texas law, a Person is defined as a business or corporate entity.  I am not a Person!  Residence is defined as the place the business or corporate entity resides.  And I can not figure out how one can get arrested for not knowing a piece of information that is not required of him.  By the way, you would be amazed to know how many people do not know their D.O.B.  I am an American national, born here and was a guest on someone else's private property that was charged with other things that were also not an arrestable offense.  The judge told him that after he was in for 7 days.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	My brother is training to become a cop. They talked about police brutality in the academy. The instructors said alot of assholes try to become cops because the power attracts them. They were pretty open about it really, saying that they try to get in so they can intimidate and go on a power trip.<br>  Now that doesnt mean most are bad guys, just a higher than average percentage of pricks than your normal job. Deal with the good and bad and dont back talk the cops. Be polite, do what they say as long as it doesnt violate your rights.|`|dAsrWr3Maa	I'd have to agree with troopers answer.  Police brutality is def a more "eye catching" subject then an officer saving a life.  Its normal and the media will make it 10 times worse then what it is.  Whenever use of force is used on duty a proper investigation takes place to make sure the force used was justified.  If it wasn't then either the officer receives reprimand from the department or criminal charges are filed (depending on severity). You are right though, sometimes cops do go to the extreme without realizing the punishment.  Thank god for good cops, believe me, they are still out there!|`|bmKhbWiTaa	To all you people who think that police over step the mark. You trade places with them and see if you can handled what they have to see and do in a days work. With these tapes you only see you don't hear anything. <br>  If that was your child and you were on the other end of that attack, what would you do?<br>  Just remember its not how big you are, it's the right spot at the right time. <br>  The authority has to abide by the law, what law does the criminal abide by "NONE". <br>  Something fighting fire with fire is the only way to get order back into today's society. If we let the criminal rule our society, the law is worthless.<br>  "we know what a brute is" you should ask the victims, not the criminal that get a slap on the hand. The victim suffer a very long time.|`|MiGqsCtoaa	Police officers are humans. There are good and bad days. However, police officers have duty to uphold the laws of justice and set an example for the community. If an officer beats down someone, like the officer who beat downed a 15 year-old girl, then they will have to answer for it. There are procedures set forth in their training to control subjects. However, constant repitition of same subjects will get on anybody's nerves. I look up to our law enforcement officers. They put their lives down for us and protect our community.

You are free to worship whatever god you want, but it should not influence this nations' laws or government.  That's unconstitutional.  What if the majority of the people in this country belonged to a religion that believed that all white people should be sterilized or that everyone over 30 should be euthanized or that everyone should eat baby meat or that  christians should not be allowed to marry?  How would that be fair to impose these beleifs on everyone by way of governmental laws?|`|82399dd1e147973b3a6565d02444ec48aa	God or not. Tell me this:<br>   <br>  When has any one (or any country) enjoyed a good time when you lie, plunder, kill and maim other for your benefit. The social code (called religion with a figure head called God) is all towards maintaining an order. When the most intelligent people on the planet be it from Enron or Lehman Brothers or AIG plunder the not so intelligent; some divine intervention kicks in to restore order. <br>  Think about it, why did the Roman empire implode?<br>  <br>  The problem is we have really short term memories and misinterpret the living in the 'here and now' as acquiring as much as possible in the shortest possible time.<br>  <br>  We are actually in good times...the scum is being cleaned. <br>  <br>  So rejoice !|`|GcQl76mfaa	Nope.

NO HARM NO FOUL. Unless he kidnapped or killed one of them that is felony. Unless your neighbor is showing unusual sign of being pedophile he is not a danger to your kids.....yet. Yes he is allowed to film whatever he thinks he likes around his neighborhood. Trees, kids,plants etc...call the police for a neighbor filming your kids playing? Why? He could have lost his own kids some how and filming your kids remind him of his, or other reason but we never know would we unless we figure out what he is up too in the course of time. So in the meantime you got no charge for asking the police to arrest a man who is filming your kids. He might reason out WHY? WHAT IS WRONG? You on the other hand can be counter-charge with another offense of defamation or wrong interpretation of his status quo. You must know his motives otherwise, you cannot TOUCH YOUR NEIGHBOR WITH A 10 FOOT POLE.<br>  <br>  Do anything? Of course you can do something by making a personal check on the background of your neighbor and taking from there.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	He's probably getting evidence to prove a noise nuisance claim if he's filming in the open. I think legally he is allowed to do this as long as it is in the public area with no expectation of privacy. The police could question him but I don't think they could stop him but that could at least put your fears to rest about his motives.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Why are your children playing in the street?  Maybe he's trying to get proof that your not watching your kids.|`|C1r8C58oaa	start buy asking the police . impritty shore that is in privacy laws.. look you cant even take a cammera to a show or a pool any more <br>  <br>  even ask you police they mite be interested . and ask them about the preditors list you never no have you ever googled your neighbores|`|LCHnUuS6aa	Speak to the neighbour and outline your objections.  It is against the law to make such images of under 16s without written consent from their parents; inform him of this.  If he carries on, then ring the police (not on 999!) and ask for advice and support.|`|odc8LHbBaa	As a Japanese filmmaker i feel that i can answer your question.<br>  <br>  whatever ur thinking, he is obviously not a pedophile. just let him do as he wishes and relax. if u call the police they will think ur CRAZY!|`|E4IkxFH2aa	PEDOPHILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|ccCCXewRaa	Maybe thats totally WEIRD TELL HIM TOG ET THE HELL AWAY FROM YOuR CHILDREN HE'll make your children go away from you !!|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	depend on what he does when he watches the video's..<br>  <br>  the children are outside , so I am not sure if he can because they are minors.. <br>  <br>  I would ask someone..|`|1KGXts5Daa	In the US, it is legal to film or photograph anyone in public, including minors.  <br>  <br>  Unless the street in question is a "private drive", he is within his rights.<br>  <br>  The person doing the filming would have to get parental/guardian permission if they intended to make the video part of the public domain (ie: in a movie, on the internet, etc.)  or if they intended to profit from it.<br>  <br>  If you are not in agreement with your neighbor filming your children, the best thing to do would be to simply tell him that.  <br>  <br>  If you were to call the police, assuming they were to come out, they would simply ask him for you.  There is no law that they could cite or enforce related to filming people in public.
398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	I haven't seen anything yet that has made me think anyone on the right is going to take violent action.  The right is no more dangerous or abusive than the left.  <br>  <br>  The media, who loves Obama and put him in power, is very good at downplaying their abuse of Bush and the right, while making us look like evil horrible people, or worse, labeling us all as ignorant hicks and rednecks because we don't agree with the way the left is running the country.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	I don't recall anyone complaining when Bush was compared to Hitler.<br>  <br>  I have no hatred for Obama.<br>  His Socialistic polices disgust me, and the Congress is worse than he is.<br>  OH!  He inherited everything from Bush!<br>  <br>  I told my bank that about my mortgage, and they almost died laughing. <br>  <br>  I want our Republic back.|`|AA11163314	If you think this - then you really need to start listening to what they are saying - not what you are being told they are saying.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Good question. I am worried about the violent, ignorant comments coming from the right side as well. I really think they are more dangerous.|`|9PAavWnyaa	No, not more dangerous nor more abusive. Your left leaning tendencies are noted.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Neither dangerous nor abusive.<br>  They're right.|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	Neither, I don't think.  I think they're just a bunch of talk because they are still mad over the election and their candidate losing by such a big margin.  And some are mad because we have a biracial man for president.  Until I met my husband I thought racism/ethnicism was not a problem because I didn't witness it.  But it's still around...and it's fewer people, but those people are meaner than they used to be.  For instance we have a waitress at one of the local restaraunts that the first time she waited on us she ignored us, filled our glasses once and pretty much threw the ticket as she ran by the table.  Now she passes us off to other people who LOVE to wait on us because we're good tippers.  So that's something to consider too.|`|gTS6xTO4aa	some people are just so bitter that the person they voted for didn't win that it is almost as if they want obama to fail just so they can be proven right.<br>  <br>  its completely counter-productive and a waste of time<br>  <br>  I am all for criticism (constructive) because it is healthy and there needs to be a forum for all perspectives to be heard... but when it becomes violent and ignorant then it crosses the line
AA10202389	The conservatives are manipulated by sociopaths, psychopaths and control freaks. They have an army of brainwashed, mostly ignorant, economic hit men and verbal abusers who will soon wake up. I have faith. In the meantime I'm not so sure they can reason. They follow leaders who are also too dumb to know they are being used. They are afraid of a new world order and don't know that the sick people manipulating them are the new world order and we are already in it. They don't know that they are hypnotized by TV, the media and the 'educational' system. The truth hurts, but I can't lie. It's hard to admit or even see what is beyond your experience. It's harder to see outside your knowledge limits. You must remember that they are brainwashed to take orders without thinking and schools don't teach critical thinking or any kind of thinking, for that matter. Unless thinking like a bully is considered thinking. Sort of adult trolls. The ones that can think have sold their souls for money or power or are sociopaths themselves. I wonder if it's good thinking to not realize that we can do more and be happier working together rather than against each other. Maybe that's what sociopathic is, no common sense, educated idiots. Instead they fit the profile of the last days.<br>   <br>  "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 2 Timothy 3:2-5 <br>  <br>  How's that for prophecy fulfilled?<br>  They are afraid of a technological society because they think they will be controlled, as they are now, but more harshly. Actually the only "new" order left, we haven't tried, is a sane one that wouldn't care what they did and might even help them do it, if that was their wish. They could have their own countries if they wanted or any other country they got into, they would only have one law, don't harm anyone else. The Friendly Islands of the South Pacific are called that because all the warlike islands killed each other off and only the peaceful islands remained with anyone alive. "The meek shall inherit the earth."|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	1. Clinton "cured" homelessness, remember? <br>  2. What do you mean, educationless?<br>  3. Unemployment was at historically low rates during Bush's terms.<br>  4. The people uncovered by health insurance during Bush's terms were overwhelmingly young adults who mostly didn't see the need for it, and illegal aliens.<br>  5. We don't need everyone to be college educated. Who would fix cars, pave roads, plumb and build homes, or grow food? <br>  <br>  If Obama would quit trying to fix the economy and instead act as a leader, stability would quickly return and the economy would repair itself. Just like it always has when left alone.<br>  <br>  AS for your last bit -- who is a worse terrorist -- enjoy your kool-aid. Even the evil Barney Frank did not deliberately murder American citizens in that way. Even Rod Blagoyevich isn't that bad. That was a day of nearly unimaginable evil for most Americans. For you to try to equate that with politics tells me you have no sense of moral weight whatsoever.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Many of the "UNINSURED" are usually young people that have chosen not to pay for healtcare because of using the money for other things.  I use to be like that until I needed healthcare.  I think this is dishonest to use these numbers in the total uninsured but you can use the numbers to support anything you want and the liberals do.<br>  <br>  Obama is doing the Mother of Job losses with his " Stimulus Plan"   it is punishing business and the unemployment numbers have increased since November 2008 so who do we blame for this?<br>  <br>  Fewer people attending college?  Fewer are graduating high school.  Who is the party of education ?  Dems and LIberal.  I think that the liberals should be prosecuted for child abuse considering how the schools have been run and the propaganda that has come out of them since the 60's.  Students do not know geography, math, english or grammar. But they sure know how to put a condom on and they know about reproductive issues.  What has been the focus?  Where are we world wide as far as ranking in education?|`|9PAavWnyaa	It didn't come to light because it was not fact. The media would have publicized anything that would have made Bush look bad. In order for me to lend any credence to your claims  of "homeless, educationless, and unemployment rates" occurring in huge numbers from 2000 - 2008 I would like to see the link where you got your information. Obama did inherit a mess, one created by Congress and their party politics being given priority over national interests. Unfortunately, he has to deal with essentially the same Congress to try to get things straightened out.
MiGqsCtoaa	You and the police officer will get in trouble with the law. It would be considered entrapment if he decides to race you and then arrest you. Entrapment is when someone is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit; and the law as a matter of policy forbids conviction in such a case. You will have to prove that you did not have an intent to commit the crime. This will be hard to prove if you are agreeing to race him.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Don't break the law, he has the opportunity to give you a ticket.

If he's a cool guy with you, I think that he's just trying to unwind and relax.  I don't think he'd stoop as low to ticket you or impound you if you win, although he may joke about it.  Mind you, it would never stand in court, and he should know this.

a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	The typical reaction to Obama's move was represented in a Los Angeles Times sub-headline in its Saturday piece describing Obama's decision. It read, "Lifting Bush's limits on research will reopen a door for science." But no door had been closed. <br>  <br>  Bush's executive order banned federal funding only of new stem cell lines. Neither federal funding of existing lines nor private funding was banned. In fact, Bush was the first president to spend any money on ESCR at all. Clinton spent zero.<br>  <br>  The Times notes, as we have, that in 2006 researchers led by Dr. Shinya Yamanaka of Japan's Kyoto University were first able to "reprogram" human skin cells to behave like embryonic stem cells. But it claims the potential of these induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS) "is still unclear."<br>  <br>  No, it's not. They can do everything stem cells from destroyed embryos can do, except without the moral baggage or the destroyed embryos.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I think they are pissing in fan with this embryonic stem cell sh*t. They have invested 10's of millions (if not 100's of millions) into it all over the world and yet there has not been a single breakthrough. <br>  <br>  Not one. <br>  <br>  They are promising cures for things that may not ever be cured. If the research was so promising, why aren't people buying stock in these companies? Instead of giving the money to these companies, why doesn't the government buy stock in them? That way, if they ever do make a big discovery, we can earn some of our investment back.<br>  <br>  It's all a bunch of crap giving false hope to people who are desperately grasping at straws.<br>  <br>  All the politicians who cooed and drooled while standing behind Obama when he signed the order are the same who coo and drool everytime Al Gore preaches Global Warming. <br>  <br>  Sorta takes away from their credibilty.

We both have our fringe elements but they don't represent the core but as long as that attitude is kept alive, the more it will divide.

4TT8lSgwaa	Because they consider themselves as civilized people even though they permit to legally slaughter unborn children every day just like it is in US.|`|wtdic2w7aa	They do have life imprisonment. The UK for example has a mandatory life sentence for murder and a maximum of a life sentence for many other crimes (though it doesn't mean life very often, instead a minimum term is set and prisoners are assessed after that term as to whether they are fit to be released and stay in prison if they're not). However, most countries rarely impose whole life sentences because a whole life sentence is just disproportionate to the crime in most cases. In he UK only the most serious criminals are given a whole life sentence-the average is about fifteen years and there are quite comprehensive sentencing guidelines that suggest a starting point of twelve years and add on or take away for mitigating or aggravating circumstances. I personally think it's a very good system.<br>  <br>  The US in comparison goes over the top with sentencing to the point where it gets silly and pointless. It then only overcrowds prisons, wastes tax payers money and obviously does nothing to help the crime rate.<br>  <br>  Contrary to public opinion most serious crimes are not committed by people who are 'evil'. The majority of murders for example are committed between people who know each other during an argument, situations aggravated by heightened emotion and committed with no previous forethought. What is the point in giving a whole life sentence, or even the death penalty, to someone who (albeit monumentally and they obviously need some serious help) simply lost their temper in the heat of the moment? It disproportionately punishes a very human fault we are all capable of.<br>  <br>  Prison sentences have several objectives; to punish the offender, to rehabilitate and ensure they're safe to be released into society. I think most EU countries take this to a sensible degree with sentences that are no longer than necessary and in proportion to the severity of the crime.<br>  <br>  What is the point after all of giving a sentence that is way over the top, but to leave someone in prison bitter and angry and more at risk to society?|`|Ms9mIgXUaa	Because the death penalty is prohibited under the European Convention on Human Rights, which all EU countries have to sign up to.|`|GnNRiqHCaa	Because the death penalty is not a deterrent and is barbaric; AFAIK, some EU countries do have life imprisonment.|`|XHmz4R99aa	Don't need to when you have torture.|`|VgWJ8yvwaa	For the same reason that they ask of Netherlands to ban marijuana to become a member.

It is all under the mask of humanist ideology but in reality they just want to create a mindless throng of bores and drones.

Check out this NYT editorial from a very rich man:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/opinion/06hastings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/opinio...</a><br>  <br>  Please Raise My Taxes<br>   By REED HASTINGS<br>    Published: February 5, 2009<br>  <br>  I’M the chief executive of a publicly traded company and, like my peers, I’m very highly paid. The difference between salaries like mine and those of average Americans creates a lot of tension, and I’d like to offer a suggestion. President Obama should celebrate our success, rather than trying to shame us or cap our pay. But he should also take half of our huge earnings in taxes, instead of the current one-third.<br>  <br>  (For those who don't know, Reed Hastings became very wealthy when his company Purify Software went public.  After selling Purify, Hastings founded Netflix and his net worth went stratospheric.)<br>  .|`|lr74sHPLaa	I dont know about all that, uhhbama had all the bottom dwellers, link?|`|WCkOUF9aaa	You made those numbers up.<br>  <br>  Why don't just the ones that voted for him pay for his amateurish ideas?|`|AA11765933	and i continue to ask if McCain could have done a better job because I seriously think if McCain had won we'd either be in a major war with either Russia or Iran or we'd be in a depression and our nation would have been totally screwed.  Stop hating on Obama and let the man do his job.|`|9FI7zaKraa	i agree that those who voted for Obama should pay the price for it. but those of us who didnt, shouldnt.|`|94cf9d8f23c4608bc6c45d40777d17c1aa	no he should tax them 100%|`|DgmlkNsIaa	but we ,the other 50% did not vote for him and it takes us down as well|`|Wt01utSbaa	Yep... its never been a secret. <br>  <br>  Hey, aren't you one of those people who say only poor people voted for Obama?

It is better to talk out of disagreements, then say"I am not playing with you". That attitude gets countries nowhere fast. We have been hated in most countries. People used to look up to this country. Bush killed that with his arrogance. Obama wants to find common threads and work for peace.You have to give and take to protect your people. Not just take and expect others to sit back and take it. Did you ever hear the saying"walk quiet and carry a big stick". Well Obama is doing just that. Not only does being reasonable look better if something major happens, but shows restraint and common sense, which i hate to say, most people on Yahoo have none. Wanting our country to fail has got to be the dumbest thing i have ever seen. How about republicans and democrats work together for the good of this country and put our forces together. Obama wants to do this, but republicans keep up their crap. Who looses here? You do!Get with it people, we need to stick together and get out of this mess. Give Obama a chance.What he is doing is not making us weak but stronger. When he has had it rest assured they will hear from him with strong language and actions.|`|57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	Russia, completely, Obama has totally caved.|`|DgmlkNsIaa	hillary|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	China is lending us money and Russia has been an Ally since the USSR collapsed so I think you're still in the last Admin's mode of thinking.

In a nutshell, EO 13233 gutted the Presidential Records Act of 1978 which the legislature passed  in response to President Richard Nixon's blatant and unprecedented abuse of executive power.  <br>  <br>  Historians will remember the uproar that ensued when the documents created by President Ronald Reagan's Administration were not released as originally scheduled under the PRA.  Instead, both President Bushes blocked the release of Reagan's and his former Vice-President's papers, restricting access to public records by invoking EO 13233.|`|rrSaoOK2aa	It was just another lie to get votes|`|Ocyrox5baa	You know a dem's word is good enough.  :)|`|94cf9d8f23c4608bc6c45d40777d17c1aa	oh wow!

The problem is that the tried and true does not often apply itself well in a fast paced world. Liberal does not always mean moving ahead, it is sometimes taken as meaning different, not better. A true Liberal, in a political sense, will see what is good in the established and want to retain it, yet also see what is bad and strive to change it for the better.<br>  In a true sense of the definition, we should all be liberal in our politics. It does not matter where we are from and under what form or level of government or organization or group we apply the position to.<br>  What is good should be retained and what is not good should be put aside and replaced.<br>  The problem is that too many believe that liberal is something completely different than what it really is. They see a threat where there is none and danger, where there is safety and relief.<br>  However, explaining a position, without branding it as either, is a sure way to express the good and replace the inoperable with the good. You can be a liberal inside and express your views and desires easily, without branding. That is a true liberal.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	It means you're ready to shred the Constitution and live by a different set of rules. Bad idea.

That's what they do to take-over free societies. They break you financially first to weaken you so you're dependent on the Gov for everything, eventually even food. They slowly start to take rights away, they blame the rich for the poor peoples circumstances, promising them he'll get them everything they want ie: health-care, welfare, college, you name it. Hitler, Marx, Napoleon all did the same thing, and because the poorer Liberals remained uneducated, influenced by Hollywood entertainers, who they think loves and cares for them, bought the lies. Socialism always takes control of free societies right from under our noses. Just like Obama did with the illegal take-over of the Census Bureau, now he can fix the 2010 elections, by reallocating (which means to re-distribute) Congressional Seats, and Federal Funds to whichever state he chooses, he can even create new districts for the minorities, especially the Hispanic populous who voted for him because of Amnesty, to practically guarantee the majority of the House, and Senate remain controlled by Democrats on his side. The GOP will be wiped out, that's when he'll start rounding up the citizens for his re-conditioning camps. Never doubt it.<br>  Obama said it was getting too political so took the Bureau from Commerce control, and he will get an Independent administrator to run it, but that "bill" won't take effect until 2012, meaning he personally, and directly with his cronies have control of it for 5 years, and the next Census will be taken in 2010.<br>  <br>  Obama didn't take the Bureau for the purpose he'd like us all to believe.

8dc5NMexaa	Prejudice has already been caused by her failure to timely respond to interrogatories and request for documents, and prejudice will continue to mount in light of the court's knowledge of her inability to maintain her attorney relationship (most probably caused here by failure to cooperate in discovery and maybe, failure to keep up with fees).  Your husband is fortunate that the same judge is hearing the motions as will be sitting at the final hearing.  Should he appear?  If he did, would he be prepared to answer certain questions, if asked by the court?  Such as, "Do you object to the withdrawal?,"  "Do you object to a continuance of the trial on the merits?," "Do you object to allowing your former wife an additional 30 days in which to answer the interrogatories and requests for production?"  It is not without the realm of possibility that he may be asked these questions, so if he attends, he should be prepared to consider the effects of each of his answers.  Do I take it correctly that he does not have an attorney?  If he doesn't, it is time for him to start asserting his procedural rights in motions to compel production and answers to interrogatories.  If he is, then same admonition.  On the motion to withdraw, the reasons stated in the motion itself will be, of course, part of the record, for the motion is a pleading filed in the record.  The motion may be granted without testimony if the former wife simply acknowledges no objection, or signs it, or does not appear at the motion hearing.  If there is testimony, then the withdrawing attorney will want to have it be of record, therefore she will ensure that a court reporter is present, and that transcript will be available to your husband should he pay for and timely ask the court reporter to transcribe the same.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	Sounds like the mothers lawyer is looking to get out of this mess, since she refuses to cooperate with the discovery process, yes the judge will know all about her unwillingness to follow discovery, since her lawyer will have to make the case to the judge to allow the lawyer to withdrawal from the case so close to court date,<br>  <br>  In reality the judge should grant the withdrawal but loose patient with the mother, and set some type of quick time lines to either retain another lawyer or respond to the discovery material or face the possibility of ruling in favor of your husband, but this is a harsh remedy one the judge will not do lightly or quickly|`|aA2dQuiAaa	In my experience, judges take lack of cooperation very seriously - it's a waste of their time and yours. <br>  <br>  Your husband should attend as many motions as possible without jeopardizing his job.

Because of the London Company.<br>  London Company, a corporation composed of stockholders residing in and about London, which, together with the Plymouth Company (see Virginia Company), was granted (1606) a charter by King James I specifically wit the purpose to found colonies in America. The London Company was granted a tract of land fronting 100 mi (160 km) on the sea and extending 100 mi inland. Government was vested in an English council, appointed by the king, which was to appoint a local council for the colony. The company's expedition, under the command of Capt. Christopher Newport, founded (1607) Jamestown in Virginia, the first of many permanent English settlements in America. In May, 1609, the company received a new charter, extending its territory and enabling it to replace the local council with an absolute governor. Thomas West, Baron De la Warr, was the first to hold that office, with Sir Thomas Gates as his deputy. A third charter, granted in Mar., 1612, made the London Company a self-governing body. There was, however, dissension within the company over governing policies, and the governing council was soon divided into two parties. The Court Party, headed by Sir Robert Rich (later the 2d earl of Warwick) and Sir Thomas Smythe, favored prolongation of martial law in the colony. The other party was the Country, or Patriot Party. Yeardley convened America's first legislative assembly at Jamestown in 1619. Although affairs in Virginia gradually improved, a petition was presented (1623) to the king calling for an investigation of conditions in the colony. Shortly afterward there appeared a paper, The Unmasked Face of Our Colony in Virginia. Already offended by the company, the king now took extreme measures. A report was made by an investigating commission, the case was tried before the King's Bench, and the unfavorable decision, rendered in May, 1624, resulted in the dissolution of the company. About ￡200,000 had been expended by the company and more than 10,000 emigrants sent to Virginia. But by then there were many many English pilgrams who had settled in America and they became permanent settlers.<br>  <br>  Edit#2 to your additional details:<br>  Once the British Companies forfeited their political power in the colonies, the American people began to self legislate and due to an enormous amount of natural resources, America became a welathy country with few occupants which attracted investors and immigrants. Once we began to self govern, we became stronger than England, but not for a while yet. It took us defeating the british on our own soil to seal our international stance. Without a doubt the fact that, back then, the British had to fight us on our own turf help us win. Once we were the victors of our own destiny, with human and natural resources that we had we built a new nation based on avoiding the mistakes of history and the incorporation of all the proven good ideas from all over the world, thanks to immigrants who were risk takers and bold adventurers. We come from the world's most amazing gene pool.

Eventually, the settlers in America wanted indipendance from the UK, so the War of Indepedance took place. The founding fathers... blah blah blah... the USA was formed.<br>  <br>  They were all originally English, so still speak English.<br>  <br>  The USA is more powerful than the UK for several reasons:<br>  <br>  They have a larger population than the UK (understandably, since the UK is tiny in size in comparison!)<br>  <br>  They have a more resource-rich country, so they have to spend less on inporting raw goods<br>  <br>  Big companys such as MacDonalds and Microsoft originated in the USA, giving them more capital income.|`|7hmjTUubaa	actually people in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, NZ, Australia, Canada and other places primarily speak English also. its because the majority of the first settlers were British so they established their language first and most immigrants that spoke different languages adopted English over the years to assimilate|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Most of the people in the original thirteen states were from England and spoke English.

Further, he has not done anything that would make him a "removable alien," at least not until his visa has ran out more than 180 days.  As far as the law is concern, he is perfectly legal.<br>  <br>  the best way to get separated from him would be to file for a divorce.  However, he would not be qualified for any public benefits as you are his financial sponsor, or whoever that person may be.

9tcv3TiWaa	TLE is temporary Lodging Expenses.  It is up to a certain amount for each day that you are in lodging.  if you paid less than the maximum amount then that is all you get.  you normally do have to submit the receipts for the lodging.  You get up to 10 days in total and this includes when you left the prior command to get to this one.    Normally you cannot ask for this in advance.  The AD member can ask for an advance on DLA (dislocation allowance), Per Diem (per day per person depends on age) and MALT (mileage, $.24 per mile).  They will give up to 80% in advance.  If this is the first move from AIT/A School/MOS/Tech then it is very difficult to get an advance.<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  With the Army if base lodging is available then that is where you stay and in which they will usually pay the lodging directly and you do not have to get the full TLE for that.   TMO usually handles the moving of belongings not finances.  He/she should speak to Finance about it, S1, etc...|`|014NXPfFaa	Normally you get it after you move.<br>  <br>  We once stayed at a hotel on base whilst moving and waiting for our home to be ready, and the Army paid for it directly - we never had to pay and the be paid back.  As far as I know TLE cannot be in an advancement.<br>  <br>  It takes about a month or two before you get paid back for your moving expenses, at least every time we've done it.  And we've PCSed every way possible, it still takes that long...

This conclusion is pretty adequately borne in the fact that liberal talk radio programming has just not performed well in the medium.

AM stations were willing to risk the wrath of the media elites and give some conservatives a voice. Conservative listeners, desperate for someone voicing an opinion they could agree with, tuned in in droves and resurrected the talk format. (Reagan ending the "fairness doctrine" also made it possible.)<br>  <br>  Liberals have tried to emulate it but since they don't actually listen to the talk shows, they believe they are all about hate anger and spite and emulate that. The result is a predictable but well funded crash and burn. Besides, liberals have plenty of media outlets to hear their opinions voiced, so there is no demand for liberal talk radio.|`|Jlcu7kQNaa	Because most Conservatives are hard working & intelligent, so all they can only listen to the radio while working. \<br>  On the other hand most Liberals sit home & collect their payment for voting in the Dem's, therefore they can watch TV|`|7MKJWM9Saa	Because people listen, trust me if people would listen and support a liberal show, it would be on the air.<br>  Its Business my friend!|`|mFInMKSaaa	Because Liberalism is a mental disorder.|`|eOUW6vafaa	This is an easy one.<br>  <br>  Simply put, its because most television news outlets are Liberal. As a result, all those conservatives out there eventually get sick and tired of hearing the news reported from the left, and seek it elsewhere. Radio happens to be the next alternative.<br>  <br>  This is why liberal talk shows don't do so well, because if someone wants to hear a liberal point of view, they turn on the TV and watch the mainstream news.<br>  <br>  As much as any news source (liberal or conservative) might claim to just report the facts, there is always some spin on it. And people are drawn to hear things reported in a way that supports what they already believe. After all, who would listen to something that basically says "you're ideals are wrong"?|`|09Ht3JyCaa	They like to say the point how it is.

Do some research and actually listen to some opposing voices.  Then ask real questions about real issues.  This is a little too general and a lot too wrong to answer.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	First of all there is no such thing in America as a "working class".  The classes in America, such as they are, are based on income level.  Just because someone is extremely wealthy does not mean they do not work.  Just because someone has a moderate income does not mean that they do work.  <br>  <br>  America does not reward the rich and curse anyone else.  The Capitalist, free enterprise system rewards success.  How much of a reward depends on the level of success.  America offers equal opportunity.  It does not promise equal results.  <br>  <br>  Some people measure their success by how much wealth they acquire.  Others by how many lives they touch.  Still others by the quality of their free time.  Each is free to pursue happiness as they wish.  <br>  <br>  To suggest a party that is based on the idea of self-reliance and small, unobtrusive government, of freedom and opportunity as "hate America", well, to be quite frank, it makes you sound remarkably like a Socialist.<br>  <br>  What has brought the economy to its knees is the ever creeping Socialist policies of Democrats starting with FDR.  Do you realize that even without the current economic problems, America is facing a 50 trillion dollar unfunded liability caused by the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs?  The massive Baby Boomer generation is rapidly reaching retirement age. <br>  <br>  *|`|AA10079277	1) Congress controls the budget and writes the laws.<br>  <br>  2) Democrats have been in control of Congress for over two years now.<br>  <br>  3) Bush warned Congress about the impending trouble with the banks, Democrats said he was "practicing fear-mongering." and the "banks are fine." <br>  <br>  So, while Republicans played a role, the Democrats are at a minimum 51% at fault. Many say more so as the economy only really started to tank in the last two years - and no one responded.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	It's a combination of the two parties, the deficit spending that's been going for decades, the political campaigns that get tied to special interests like the banks and start failing to truly act in the interests of the country, the media that's lost sight of objectivity and the interests of the country to make a buck in an increasingly internationalized world, etc.<br>  <br>  A lot of the core problems do indeed get traced back primarily to things that went through under Carter and Clinton, and then to the Democratically controlled Congress under Bush.<br>  <br>  Not that Bush and the Republicans were on the ball or anything, but the American people essentially rewarded the Democrats who screwed up by giving them a mandate this past election, which was a little bizarre. It's about as bizarre as hundreds of billions of dollars getting thrown at the banks that screwed up the most. It's very much the same sort of reasoning.<br>  <br>  But if you want to blame anything, both parties deserve blame for neglecting the true interests of the country while the borders have been ignored, jobs get outsourced, etc., and political leaders have more than anything made sure their fat cat funding sources stay happy regardless of consequence. And whatever is causing moral / ethical degradation in the U.S. for a number of years now is probably doing a lot more damage in the long run and in international interactions than anything else.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there's a systemic problem more than anything. It may be an inevitable path of capitalism, it may be overpopulation and globalization, it may be a Tower of Babel effect from the internet whereby people no longer have to demonstrate the character they once did to obtain information and influence, it may be the human race maxing itself out.<br>  <br>  But it's not the Republicans hating America.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	** laughing  **<br>  <br>  Liberals are soooo funny . . . . <br>  <br>  This entire Housing collapse is due to Democrats . . . .<br>  <br>  Jimmy (the JOKE) Carter signs "Community Reinvestment Act" telling banks they have to loan money to people who can't afford homes.<br>  <br>  Clinton turns his attack dog loose . . .

gZlRnTISaa	With life imprisonment there is always the hope of release, whereas the death penalty is the big final journey. <br>  <br>  Families of crime victims think this way, and often wish to met out the same that has befallen them.<br>  <br>  It is true here in the UK we a life sentence might be 15 years, I don't know about USA.<br>  <br>  And the other thing is, what if the person is innocent?

To live and to live and to live and to live! No matter how you live, if only to live! How true that is! God, how true! What a scoundrel man is! And he's a scoundrel who calls him a scoundrel for that."<br>  <br>  The above excerpt is from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

AA11632370	I have Answered a similar question before and I would like to post the same here, as follows:<br>  <br>  It is true that YouTube and eSnips have been blocked "in the national interest of Bangladesh" by the newly elected prime minister, Sheikh Hasina when she addressed the top military officers (in the aftermath of BDR massacre at Pilkhana) in Dhaka Cantonment and the heated discussions were secretly circulated using YouTube and eSnips.<br>  <br>  Official defends YouTube block. Sun, Mar 8th, 2009 10:32 pm BdST. Quote: ...."An audio on the proceedings of the March 1 meeting between Prime Minister (PM) Sheikh Hasina and hundreds of army officers at the Dhaka cantonment in the wake of the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny was posted on both the sites, and visitors passed on the links through emails".... <br>  <br>  I think the present government is trying hard to see that no negative propaganda could be circulated that may tarnish its Image and the first step was to block the access of Youtube website from Bangladesh.<br>  <br>  What a country we are living in now when we elect people who promise to have transparent administration and then after coming to power they start muffling any type of opposition voices. Where are our so-called intellectual pressure groups and others who were breathing and eating the 'human rights' day-in and day-out and keeping mum at this crucial time and not vehemently questioning for meting out justice to the perpetrators and their backers?<br>  <br>  We do hope that present government would not interfere in the enquiries and trials of the masterminds as well as the killers and also keep away from creating any sort of barrier in the dissemination of information and let the people judge who is in the right path and who is crying wolf!<br>  <br>  Hope above helps.|`|tMEUPBo4aa	Yes, Bangladesh did ban YouTube and other websites. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090310/wl_sthasia_afp/bangladeshunrestinternetcensorship">http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090310/wl_...</a><br>  <br>  Meanwhile, YouTube is banning UK from using its site for viewing music Videos|`|K9AhD43maa	Not only 4 music video.....there r something .........<br>  this gov is playing some game with public..if u hear that licking conversation about Pm and Bdr...thats the main reason  .................... hope understand..what i m fingering at.....

hqbt98QIaa	Two things: <br>  1. The second part is pretty much the way it is now... you get a set amount of education and unlimited options are available to you to make the most of... the problem is that not everyone can or will make the best use of their options and when they fail, the people that did it right have to pay for their bailout. Sound familiar?<br>   2. If all of your assets are redistributed when you die, there's a lot of incentive for society to knock off people who do well in life and not really a lot of incentive to have anything at the end.

Rarely are assets just the product of single earner in our society, but are usually the result of a marriage. Why should the surviving spouse be deprived of assets which they contributed to the earning of. Additionally, I hate to break it to you, but everyone in this country already receives a set level of education which actually precedes their 18 birthday. I do not object to helping people with limited means who aspire to higher education, but I do not believe it should be an entitlement. Sorry you are just trying to repackage the same old socialist argument which is that the wealth people earn is not really theirs, but rather just on loan from society as a whole. Lastly, the merits of the individual are already what determines success for most in life. Those willing to work harder usually tend to achieve greater heights. Those who benefit from entitlement generally do not fair as well because they have the mentality that everything should be granted to them rather than achieved.<br>  <br>  60srad: I disagree with your characterization of what socialism is about. The prevailing idea in socialism is that the people own the means of production and additionally the product of that production. "Each according to his means to each according to his needs" means that you do not retain anything beyond that which is required for basic existence. All surplus is redistributed and creation of stored wealth is disallowed because it does not serve the needs of the collective, but rather just the individual.|`|YbI6PKw3aa	Don't think it would work.

BzctzIcgaa	Just like anything in politics, one party (or both) will make a base bill, such as "Health care for children" and most people say, wow, thats great.<br>  The media then portrays it as so, but the congressmen and senators add on several earmarks and extensions, such as making a bridge to nowhere, or a new jet for so&so. They might make it so the plan includes a lot more people, and when the other party goes against it, the media says they are trying to deny health care to children, when they really just are trying to remove the earmarks and add ons. Also, many people in politics use it as ammo against their competitors saying things like "Republicans don't want your kids to have health care, or they don't want to keep your children safe." Or also, "the opposite party voted against a bill to help cancer research" when it was really just loaded down with extras.<br>  <br>  <br>  MMm note: I didn't understand what the one guy was saying, as in don't help at birth, and the guy who said Republicans are all about war... ponder this. In a time where terrorists are killing our families, and our economy is slumping, and we have a lot of other problems, why would your first move be closing a prison full of Terrorists and evil? And why can't we torture those who kill and rape and torture others, themselves? All in all, Guantanamo Bay was needed to keep terrorists in, and where will they be now? "dealt with severely and swiftly" But where? why not there? Most likely his new policy is "Here terrorists, we offer you $10,000 to go back and not kill." Wow, great idea.

It is basically a package to pay off the lobbyists, special interest groups, and friends of the congress for their Liberal and Obama support throughout the years. A little inkling of "tax relief" was added to try to convince the average American that this is all about helping them amd helping the economy. It's a "Perks for Pelosi" package.<br>  <br>  This stimulus package does little for the people. The TARP Wall Street  bank bailouts are even worse. The moey disappears in black hols such as AIG, Bank of America, Fannie Mae, Citigroup etc. The money is never seen again and the only thing the taxpayers get are higher banking fees. 700 billion flushed down a great big toilet. And more bank bailouts (i.e gifts to the banks and their executives) are coming.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I agree!  Why can't they get the pork trimmed out and in a few months they can have a pork bill all on its own.

DgfEkFGLaa	I say it's just typically pathetic. The new smear is the 25 dvd's given to Prime Minister Brown was an insult. With some research I found that only the British press was offend. And the 25 D.V.D.'s were a collection of classic American films such as "Grapes of Wrath" and "Wizard of Oz" and Raging Bull."<br>  This country has existed only 233 years separately from Britain so we have precious few historical artifacts compared to Britain so what would they have Obama do? Give him the original Constitution as a present?<br>  From a different commentary:<br>  "During Brown's first trip to America in the summer of 2007, he was given a fur-trimmed brown leather bomber jacket by President George W. Bush."<br>  Can anyone say that was a better present?|`|AA10331255	It's not the fact that he uses it, it's that he uses it ALL the time.  Takes it everywhere.

I'm certain that you were right in there lobbing smears at Bush for 8 years.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Why do liberals constantly make excuses for unacceptable behavior?<br>  <br>  BO uses a teleprompter because he can't talk. He can't put two words together without help. He's thick. He's dense. He's a dope. <br>  <br>  The most common utterances are "uhhhhhhhh" and "uhhhhhhh uhhhhhhh." He has to read in order to communicate. He cannot think on his feet, he cannot speak off the cuff.<br>  <br>  He's rude and arrogant. He is the first president in 40 years to blow off the Medal of Honor Inaugural Ball. He can't salute. He has no respect for the military that protect him and this country. He's an arrogant pig.<br>  <br>  The fact that he uses a teleprompter is just further proof that he's a phony. Why does a person need a teleprompter to answer questions from the press unless he needs to have the answers fed to him? <br>  <br>  It's not pathetic. It's the truth. Again, liberals go too far out of their way to excuse all the arrogant, stupid, moronic behavior of a con artist that duped them. It's called codependency. It's the same thing as defending the drunken partner who beats you. It's sick.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	Guess who else used a telepromter.<br>  <br>  -Bush<br>  -Bush Sr.<br>  -Reagan<br>  -Eisenhower (the first the use it actually)<br>  <br>  So theres no logic when they try to smear Obama with the word "teleprompter."|`|EPObVPzVaa	It's accumlative.<br>  <br>  And, there is quite an accumulation in such a short period of time.<br>  <br>  The man is a maniac.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	He's using it as transmitter for ELF waves to keep his audience braindead.

Karl Rove put this idea together - and it's been used by every major republican dirt ball since - I heard it come out of the mouth of that miserable little Tom Delay.<br>  <br>  Ugly, abusive, hurtful stupid, brutal, idiotic and brain dead - thy name is Republican!|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	The point is he uses it more than any one in history even for the shortest public appearances, everything he says is written in advance, others have used a teleprompter but B.

Didn't she help defeat Republican  Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-RI), calling him a "half-wit" and a "silver-spooned moron" -- while expressing her support for his challenger in the September 12 Republican primary, Stephen Laffey?<br>  This is not the first time Coulter has alluded to killing those she disagrees with. With friends like Coulter, the Republican Party doesn't need enemies.<br>  Commenting on radio host Melanie Morgan's assertion that, if New York Times executive editor Bill Keller were convicted of treason, she "would have no problem with him being sent to the gas chamber," Coulter said, "I prefer a firing squad, but I'm open to a debate on the method of execution." She later suggested that (other) Times staff members should be "executed." <br>  Coulter said of the suggestion that media had been hurt by the military: "Would that it were so! ... that the American military were targeting journalists." <br>  Coulter suggested that Rep. John P. Murtha (D-PA) ( a 20 year veteran ?) is "the reason soldiers invented fragging," -- military slang meaning the intentional killing of a member of one's own unit. <br>  Coulter argued that the national debate during the Monica Lewinsky controversy should not have focused on whether former President Bill Clinton "did it," but rather "whether to impeach or assassinate" him. <br>  Coulter said of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens: "We need somebody to put rat poison in Justice Stevens' crème brulée.'' <br>  Commenting on the young American who fought with the Taliban, in her address at the "Conservative Political Action Conference" (CPAC) in 2002 : "When contemplating college liberals, you really regret once again that John Walker is not getting the death penalty.  We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed too.  Otherwise they will turn out to be outright traitors." <br>         ( Coulter would obviously like to be among those doing the killing of college liberals.  But she is totally oblivious of the fact that the Taliban which Walker joined are ultra-Conservatives who hate the United States for being such a symbol of Liberalism! <br>    I trust that she is likewise ignorant of the fact that John (whose last name is Lindh, and whose middle name is the same as George W. Bush's), joined the Taliban at the very time that the U. S. A. had given the Taliban government of Afghanistan 43 million dollars. If John Lindh was an enemy of the U.S. for helping the Taliban at that time, then so was George W. Bush.  <br>  Thank Mammon for "Christians" like Coulter!   When asked where she worshipped, Coulter answered "Redeemer Presbyterian Church", in Manhattan. Funny, but the membership secretary of that church has no knowledge of Ann Coulter ever having attended that church! Conservative "Christians", however, view Ms. Coulter as an authority on Christianity.)|`|o0JEkGCjaa	Since I don't see her as ladylike at all, yes.<br>  You can put a woman in a dress but it does not make her a lady.<br>  She is a perfect example of that.|`|zCZGAStBaa	IM SO SICK OF YOU LIBERALS COMPLAINING ABOUT COULTER<br>  <br>  YOUR JUST JEALOUS CAUSE WE HAVE A PERSON WHO KICKS MAJOR A$$|`|quN4DCGWaa	I'm definitely more of a lady than her.

AA10138269	I don't believe that they have to but if they are forced to then its not worth it to take that position or office. A muslim was sworn in a couple of years back but used the Koran. If they appeased him then they should appease an atheist.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	It's a matter of tradition.|`|AA10166914	So far as I know, there is no LAW that commands a person to "swear" on a Bible or any other religious book.   Swearing on a book, object, person or other is only as good as the intent of the person doing the swearing is.  In other words, the oath they take in the presence of various heads of state and the American people is binding, irregardles of whether they use the Bible or Torah or Quiran.<br>  <br>  For your information, denying that God exists does not in any way eliminate Him; He does exist, He Will exist forever whether or not you want to believe in Him or not.  I doubt if you have lived long enough to even KNOW whether there is a God or not.   Right now it is very popular to pretend that God is a phantom or figment of some crazy persons' mind, so  reading that you proclaim to be an Atheist doesn't surprize me.  I do believe in God, He has proven His existence to me over and over, I promise you, one day, sometime you are going to be put in a situation where you are going to have to really weigh your position between denying God or believing in Him, one day you will have to choose whose hands you want to put your life into. <br>  <br>  There IS a God.  There IS a devil.  There IS a place called Heaven where the people of God will live after their life here is done; there IS a place where the lost will go to that has been created for the devil and his slaves and all people who choose to turn their backs on God.  God does not send anyone to Hell, you send yourself because you listen to the wrong voice and you follow the wrong leader.  Do not be tricked into making the wrong choice because of the lie that God does not exist.  Thoughts like that come straight from the devil and if he can convince you that you have made the choice all by yourself, he will lay hands on you and take you down to hell where both of you will spend eternity.  <br>  <br>  One day we will all stand before God  in Judgement; and He will have the Book of Life in front of Him...  Satan will be there too... ALL whose names are not found in the Book of Life will be snatched from in front of God and taken to hell where they will be FOREVER.    That is the truth.  <br>  <br>  I urge you to study about this for yourself before you go making choices that could make your future VERY unhappy.   Study both sides before you turn your back on God.  I truly hope that you dig deep for the TRUTH before condemning yourself to Hell where you will live for all eternity...  there will be no pleasures there... no anything but complete misery...  is that REALLY what you want?|`|Fbiv0h2Iaa	If you feel there is no God why would putting your hand on a book and reciting  an oath bother you??....ever wonder why, whenever you hear the word God or especially the name of Jesus you get angry, or bothered deep down in your soul...oh, I'm sorry, you don't believe you have a soul...ok, deep down in your "inner self"???  Why??....ever ask yourself that??...|`|c24282040d7da6cf349fea698367f227aa	There is no requirement to use any sort of religious book during the oath of office.<br>  <br>  Personally I would prefer that they swear on a copy of the Constitution.

Many cities raise prices a little every year.  Apparently your city didn't do that, and needs to catch up.  <br>  <br>  You pay for what you use.

If you don't like it, go buy water somewhere else.|`|kX4JPvwwaa	I agree 100% with the first answer.  And if the funding is to lay new water pipes, why is increasing the price of water an outrageous way to raise them?  It is the most appropriate way by far.<br>  <br>  Water is going to become more expensive in our lifetimes.  There is no way to keep it really cheap forever.  It's a simple reality.  If you're looking for a culprit, start by examining our outdated irrigation and sewage practices across the country.
fgIbNRHfaa	If Steven was still 17 at the time of his lawsuit, we was a minor and unable to sue in his own name.  That being the case, it was probably actually his parents who filed the lawsuit.  Why did they sue?  Because the medical costs of his injury and the costs of caring for a quadriplegic are probably enormous and they were looking for any relief they could find.  Who was at fault?  Clearly Steve, as sad as the result may be.  While at first blush one might argue that a "no diving" sign would have been in order, the fact that he jumped in once already and discovered for himself that the water was only a foot deep means that he already knew it wasn't safe to dive and a sign telling him that would not have helped.  I do wonder why the city had a life guard chair there if there is no lifeguard on duty.  One might argue that the chair was what the law calls an "attractive nuisance" (like a swimming pool with no fence, with "attracts" other kids to use it even without authorization).  One could argue that the chair merely served to attract beachgoers to sit in it and perhaps try to dive from it.  However, I do not believe, based on the facts you have given, that the city will ultimately be found liable.  While it is very sad, it was Steve, in his alcohol affected state, who knowingly dove into foot deep water.  I am sorry for your friend's injury.  Best wishes.<br>  <br>  You didn't share the outcome of the trial.  Did the court find the city was liable?

d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	Once your sister's boyfriend signs the birth certificate, the child is his, as the song goes, "forever and ever, amen."  He can't come back later after he breaks up with your sister and say he doesn't want to pay support because the child isn't (or may not be) his.  Signing the certificate establishes paternity, so a court can't then go back and order a test DNA to establish it, that's redundant.  Even if he obtained a private DNA test proving the child wasn't his, he would need to retain an attorney in a long and expensive court battle he probably can't win, anyway.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is, the court doesn't care what mistakes are made by the parent(s), who are supposed to be adults.  The court only cares what is in the best interest of the child.  It's never in a child's best interest to be told "This is your father," and then later, "Oops!  Not your father."  You may not care "if that means never knowing who the real father is," but I promise you, that child does care.  Very much.  If you, your sister, her boyfriend (everyone the child should be able to trust) begins his life, in fact, establishes his whole identity, on a lie, how seriously screwed up do think that child will turn out to be?  (Trust me, the answer is, "VERY."  I work with these kids everyday.)<br>  <br>  If the biological father steps up, he would need to retain an attorney to fight for paterity (assuming the certificate was signed by the boyfriend).  If he were to do that, could he get custody?  Perhaps not based solely on that, but he would definitely have good standing with the court, having done the right thing, while your sister (and her boyfriend) having not acted in the child's best interest, would not.<br>  <br>  If I were your sister, I would not take that chance.  I would do the right thing for my child and tell him who his father is, truthfully, from the beginning.  (Which, in this case, will require a DNA test.)  A lot of children are successfully and lovingly raised by a stepparent.  Nothing wrong with that.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	the only thing i see wrong about that these people are saying is if he signs the papers he has to pay child support NO he doesn't he is signing them caus he wants to take responability and yes he'll be the legal father by signing them but he doesn't have to pay child support  the only thing he has to pay is to help her with the baby that's it|`|3tuwWidiaa	First, if this isn't the real dad, and the real (biological) dad shows up, then yes... this guy loses his rights.<br>  <br>  Until that happens, he's the father.  Which means that if they break up, he's still the father and would have the same child support responsibilities as any other father in this situation.  At that point, he might try to duck responsibility with a paternity test.  If so, a judge may very well still order him responsible.  Or not.  It would have to go to court.<br>  <br>  The one thing, though, is that your sister is unlikely to lose the child.  She's definitely the mother.  So, even if there is a huge battle between different dads, it still belongs to her.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Once he signs, he is the presumptive father - nothing, not even a paternity test by another man, will overturn that.  It's very rare for a judge to even consider doing so.  If they were to break up, he will have to pay child support, but he could also fight for custody.  <br>  <br>  The thing is - this really is more about your new nephew than your sister.  It sounds like this guy really wants to be there for her and his son.  If he does not sign, and for some reason she went on welfare or medicaid, the state would order her to name the father.  <br>  <br>  I'm wondering too that if she did not allow him to sign now (if she even could), would that do something to their relationship.  In all this worry, you could destroy what could be a very nice family unit.|`|RGiS7zcLaa	Whomever signs the birth certificate is the legal father.  That person will have to pay child support.  If another man comes forward as the father, he will have to go to court, establish paternity and have his name put on the certificate. <br>  <br>  Your sister shouldn't have anyone's name on the certificate unless she is 100% sure he is the father.
c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	They should not be coming in without a search warrant. There is no reason for them to enter your home except to search it. Therefore if they try to come in and it is not to tell you that someone has been in an accident, the only thing that can come out of their visit is something bad.<br>  <br>  What if they saw something they thought was suspicious, like a child who is not dressed running around the house. This could lead to an investigation about your parenting and possible abuse even though this child was being potty trained and needed their clothes off. Or was about to take a bath when the doorbell rang.<br>  <br>  Get the number to the police that service your area. When the police come to your door, tell them you will be right back. Lock the door and all other doors. Call the police station to verify that they are real cops.<br>  <br>  If they are real cops, tell the person on the phone that you do not want them at your house. If they complain, ask to talk to a supervisor. When they leave go down to the court house to file a police report on the situation. Also ask for anything documenting why they keep coming to your house.<br>  <br>  You may also consider having your most mature child videotape them harassing you. Be sure to get on tape that you do not know where the man is, that you do not consent to them going into your home, and that their behavior is scaring both you and the children. It is fine if they see the child videotaping, but he should only do so from inside. An older child might be able to video tape covertly. Just have the video camera out on the counter or something so it is accessible when they come. You may also have a cell phone or regular camera that could take a limited amount of film. You could also have a sign on your door (take a picture of it in case they steal it) saying that all unsolicited conversations are subject to audio recording.

Let them die there - the more the merrier. Police and military will patrol the country at least five nights a week. They are not to confine themselves to the main roads, but make across the country, lie in ambush and, when civilians are seen approaching, shout "Hands up!" Should the order be not immediately obeyed, shoot and shoot with effect. If the persons approaching carry their hands in their pockets, or are in any way suspicious-looking, shoot them down. You may make mistakes occasionally and innocent persons may be shot, but that cannot be helped, and you are bound to get the right parties some time.

In either case - you should note - it is done by FORCE - thus - government will never survive without force of some kind.<br>  <br>  That makes government a necessary evil since 100% of the people will not be 100% responsible for their actions 100% of the time. If they were we would not need government to protect our rights and we would have a fully functional anarchistic society.<br>  <br>  Returning to a Constitutionally based government would require a few things that do NOT exist today - first it would require honest people to be in office - second it would require a watchdog to keep the honest people in government honest - without these two things it will never happen<br>  <br>  It didnt happen when the government was set up, it didn't happen in the years to follow, it isn't happening now and it is not likely to happen anytime in the future - so what do we do - the best we can do now is start moving in that direction - it took us over 200 years to get where we are now - the turn around will not happen over night - it will take a minimum of two or three generations to see significant change<br>  <br>  You want to make changes today?<br>  <br>  learn about freedom, liberty and how to keep them - then spread the word <br>  <br>  learn about what your government is doing to take away your liberties and squelch your freedoms - then spread the word<br>  <br>  learn about how to stop the government from doing what it is doing - then spread the word<br>  <br>  stop the government from intereferring in your personal life - then spread the word on how<br>  <br>  learning the truth and spreading the word will do more for this country then any election past or in the near future - educate those around you and you will empower them to THINK - this is the one thing the government does NOT want is a citizenry that is capable of THINKING on their own - so if you do not like what the government is doing - then fight back - DARE TO THINK|`|C7Vn3T7Aaa	I know, all this social welfare for banks and financial institutions should stop.  They are all going to fail anyway sooner or later, any more 'bailing out' is just throwing good money after bad.  We have all be duped into believing this myth that they are 'too big to fail.'  Rubbish.  Tax money is being used by already wealthy people to line their own pockets with gold before the whole system collapses.    <br>  <br>  A voluntary system for tax would not work.  The richest people already pay the least amount of tax, they would pay nothing given the choice.  How else do you think they stay rich?  The poor, even if they live on welfare, still pay tax on goods and services, and proportionately more than rich folk, as they spend more of their income on the things that have gone up highest in price, such as food and fuel.  <br>  <br>  Printing fiat money with no controls is hardly a solution to the money supply, any first year economy student can tell you that if you have more money chasing the same amount of goods it only fuels inflation.  Inflation is a tax that eats into savings and pensions, decreasing their value in real terms.  <br>  <br>  You're right, people never change.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  It was ever thus.<br>  <br>  We have to move away from this 'something for nothing' type of economic model.  Capital used to be the accumulated proceeds of work alreay done and profits already made, now it is all credit, dependant on growth to cover the debt.  We have to stop the magic pixel money that can be generated from thin air by a banker being lent out to generate revenue for the bank by real people doing real work.  <br>  <br>  The 'money' that bankers say they have lost never existed in the first place, it still doesn't!  It hasn't been earned and paid back yet.  But that didn't stop bankers from bundling up a bunch of loans and selling them on to other bankers.  Not once, not twice, but time and time again, each time someone earning a profit on selling 'money' that doesn't exist yet.  How long did they think this could go on?  <br>  <br>  And now that it's all gone wrong, we are being conned into using real money, taxpayers money, to sort it all out.  Shameful.  As for the founding fathers, they designed the Constitution to further their own interests, namley, that those who were already rich could hold on to their wealth.  <br>  <br>  As for those who say they object to helping out those suffering hard times, consider this: if you could eliminate all the fraud, waste and abuse from the Defence budget, you could pay for all the welfare programmes three times over and never need to raise another dollar in tax.  If Wal-Mart paid their workers a decent wage and health benefits instead of expecting the government to supply their workforce with food and medical aid, it would save the taxpayer $1.5 billion.  Those 'bargins' don't look so good now, do they?  How do you propose to 'opt out' of that?|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Yes , From within , but that doesn't exclude help from other interests! Making it TREASON|`|glt02wg2aa	Basically True!  - I call it G.O.D. "Government Of Decree" - this present batch think they are above the constitutional laws = taxes don't apply to them.<br>  We do need limited taxes for defense, police & fire protection, roads but not for welfare.<br>  Social Security was supposed to be a supplement to retirement, not to be depended on - but to many now believe that G.O.D. is responsible for their welfare. So they will bow down (vote) for elimination of their own freedoms.

Over a year ago, researchers found a way to unlock adult stem cells to have the same flexibility as hEsc lines, ie, the ability to transform into any kind of tissue.  Bush’s policy in effect pushed the government-funded research in that direction, which prompted the breakthrough.  With that process available, we have no need to grind up our offspring to cure diseases, especially since grinding up our offspring has yet to result in even one therapeutic result, despite billions of dollars of research into hEsc.  A scientific approach would dictate that we follow success instead of failure.<br>  <br>  In fact, the market has done just that.  While some states (California being one) have provided public funds for hEsc research, most of the private money goes towards adult stem-cell research.  Why?  It’s a proven technology.  That’s one of the reasons hEsc researchers are so desperate to overturn Bush’s ban on federal funding — they can’t compete for any other funding any longer.<br>  <br>  This decision places politics ahead of science.  People demand government funding for hEsc not because it works, but because it’s popular.  Pro-abortion activists want it as an endorsement of abortion as some sort of mechanism for scientific advance, and they’ve managed to sucker the rest into thinking that we’ll all die unless we start destroying embryos to keep us alive.  No one has offered a single scientific reason to have the federal government fund hEsc research.<br>  <br>  oh and if it is all about science why is Rahm Emmanuel heading the census?  Seems to me the Obama Admin says it is a bout science when it is convenient for them.|`|f59ce3e6c69a87e4365442d083f0f2b6aa	Just more idiotic illogical double-talk from the Libiot-in-Chief.  How is making scientific research dependent on GOVERNMENT funds "free from manupulation or coercion?"  Actually it's just the opposite.  Just ask your nearest public school district or college if taking Federal money is "free from manipulation or coercion."  Try to count the conditions, strings and hoops you have to jump through to get Federal funding.<br>  <br>  And once you're dependent on Federal funding, then the Federal government can tell you what you must and must not do in order to keep the Federal money coming in.  Remember that concept when Obama and the Dumocrats have rammed universal health care down our throats -- when they control it, they can tell you what you must and must not do in order to continue receiving the "benefits."<br>  <br>  It's just more of the same thing liberals in power are always doing -- insinuating government money into something so the liberals in power can influence/control/manipulate it to their own self-serving ends, always justified as "compassion" or "helping us."  And liberals have no problem with distorting data to serve a political agenda, as long as it's a LIBERAL political agenda, or making scientific decisions -- like this one -- based on ideology, as long as it's LIBERAL ideology.<br>  <br>  Just more Obama lies wrapped in warm fuzzy Kumbayah platitudes and feel-good rhetoric.

If that was the truth we wouldn't be spending time on embryonic stem cell research.  There has yet to be a single use for embryonic stem cells and there are countless uses and promising uses that have been discovered using adult stem cells.  The only reason the Democrats support embryonic stem cell research is because of pro-abortion political ideology.

ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	No, there were selfish rich people who benefited from government kickbacks during the Bush administration that also voted for McCain.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Lol, YES.  But seriously, I think the biggest irony and false hood aqmong the Obama haters is that they like to THINK that Obama got in office because of all the "lazy blacks, mexicans and welfare recipients who want a hand-out", but actually, it was SENSIBLE REPUBLICANS who's finally fed up with their OWN PARTY'S BULL$hit THAT PUT Obama over the top (overwhelmingly I might add).  Blacks only make up 13% of the U.S, and we ALWAYS vote democratically anyway, just like all other minorities.  Even if you factor in the many blacks and minorities who voted for Obama "just because he's black", that's a drop in the bucket compared to the votes that came from traditionally RED STATES, that care more about the future of this country, rather than allowing the rich to get richer, just to avoid voting for a black man, and doing Con business as usual.  I thank God MOST OF US are smart enough to see past the scare-tactics, institutionalized-racism and utter ridiculous right-winged extremity.   Of course you'd never know it if you only visited this section of YA for the pulse of the people, because this is a place where bitter extreme cons come to vent their frustrations, because they have nothing else.  that's why they OVERWHELMINGLY dominate this section, but smarter people in the REAL WORLD know better (obviously, that's why we won).|`|diZoW49Zaa	132 IQ here and certainly not stupid enough to vote for Obama.|`|9twZdl6laa	not hardly.

HeoS75kGaa	Well, if it's any consolation, they're not out to get YOU.  But they ARE out to get someone, and if you give them the slightest chance, it WILL be you.  There's no shortage of people for the cops to bust out there, so what you need to do is get more savvy.  Watch your surroundings and make sure that you're not as stupid as some of the others out there.  Let THEM get the tickets.<br>  <br>  A lot of people get insulted when some speed demon races by them in traffic, so they'll speed up to show up the other guy.  Now it's 50-50 whether it's you or him that gets caught.  Let him speed past you.  Been plenty of times I've nearly crapped myself when I'm doing 10 over the limit, a cop car comes whizzing up behind me with his lights flashing, and he goes right past me to get the one who was doing 15-20 over the limit.<br>  <br>  And if EVERYBODY seems to be really careful, take the hint.  Somebody up ahead knows something that you haven't found out about yet.  Why find out the hard way, with your wallet?|`|LSxBwiFSaa	-If you have NOTHING to be "nervous" ABOUT, then WHAT are You afraid of ??!  Guilty Minds- tend to ACT that way... And THAT's what Cops look for- when they pull someone over... Keep your nose (AND your Record) clean- & you'll have NOTHING to worry about, from the Police... OTHERWISE, You can expect to get "Nervous"- every time a Cop crosses your Path... It's JUST common sense...  :)

OiAl6w48aa	The most common penalty is that it raises a presumption against the destroyer that the evidence would harm that party's case.  As an example, I had a case involving a car accident with a commercial vehicle.  We subpoenaed the commercial vehicle's service records - one of our contentions was that it had not been properly maintained.  The other party destroyed the service records and the vehicle.  The court ruled that we got to argue to the jury that the records would have shown that the vehicle was not properly maintained, and the party destroyed the records to prevent this from coming out.<br>  <br>  Other penalties can include monetary sanctions, bar complaints, and in extreme cases, dismissal of a complaint.

AA10302860	I think your joke would have been better if you used a "rug" or "carpet" rather than his desk.  When crafting "comedy" the more connections you have to reality, the more insightful will be your parody.  (The position of a muslim's desk really doesn't affect their prayers as far as I am aware.)<br>  <br>  Your premise is that Obama is really a muslim, and that in and of itself is somewhat derogatory and maybe even could be described as bigotry, so you really have to come hard with the parody to make this kind of joke work.<br>  <br>  Here's a better example, "Why did George Bush move the couch in the oval office away from th door."<br>  <br>  Cause every kid knows you don't build your couch fort right next to the door!<br>  <br>  See...that plays on the fact that George Bush was considered to be as unsophisticated as small child.  It's funnier than your joke because it's much harder to prove that Bush wasn't as unsophisticated as a small child whereas it's common knowledge that Obama isn't a muslim.  Also it's less offensive as it doesn't invoke religion.<br>  <br>  So, just some tips for your next question.<br>  <br>  You're welcome.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I am no fan of Obama-- trust me I'm way to conservative!

The collapse of the financial sector is the making of both Democrats and Republicans. Unfortunately many Democrats seem to be unable to admit the culpability of their own party in this mess including Obama and are now following a path sure to lead to greater not loss, not increased security. Additionally pointing to success in the market under Bush is also counter-productive because when it was reaching that high conditions were being ignored which would lead to the ultimate collapse.

That looks great when applying or enlisting, and it will help you move up in rank faster.<br>  <br>  The reason the Air Force is cutting down on GED members is because its become a little overmanned of late.<br>  <br>  As well talk to a recruiter now, I know I've read something about homeschoolers diplomas only be equivalent to a GED or teir 2 in military terms. Thats how it is with my school. I go to a virtual online high school, that is supposed to be the same as a regular high school.

RD5sTZaFaa	Family law is divorce, child custody, Child Protective services cases, and enforcement of child support.  That type of thing.<br>  <br>  These attorneys are generrally self employed or work for law firms taht handle this type of case.  I snow some who charge $700. per hour.  The expenses of running an office have to come out of that, and any employees the attorney has need to be paid, so they may not get to keep but a small fraction of the fee.  <br>  <br>  They may go to court daily, or at least weekly.  There are contested hearings on many family law type of matters, so yes you would get to argue in court, and cross examine witnessesses in jury trial.  Even if the state does not allow a defense to divorce there can still be a tral over the disposition of the property, or the custody of the children.<br>  <br>  What kind of people would you generally deal with?  Well, there is a saying among attorneys, "Criminal clients are some of the worst people in the community, but they are on their best behavior when dealing with their attorney, and family law clients are some of the best people in the community, but they are on their worst behavior when dealing with their attorney in their case."<br>  <br>  I prefer the ones on their best behavior.  It is never any fun to have to deal with a person who is angry, bitter, hateful, petty, and vindictive, even if you are not the subject of their rage.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: If the administration has come up with a way to ensure money does not go to home buyers who used bad judgment, it hasn't announced it. <br>  <br>  Defending the program Tuesday at a Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said it's important to save some of those people for the greater good. He likened it to calling the fire department to put out a blaze caused by someone smoking in bed. <br>  <br>  "I think the smart way to deal with a situation like that is to put out the fire, save him from his own consequences of his own action but then, going forward, enact penalties and set tougher rules about smoking in bed." <br>  <br>  Similarly, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested this month it's not likely aid will be denied to all homeowners who overstated their income or assets to get a mortgage they couldn't afford. <br>  <br>  "I think it's just simply impractical to try to do a forensic analysis of each and every one of these delinquent loans," Sheila Bair told National Public Radio. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "We have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: Although 10-year projections are common in government, they don't mean much. And at times, they are a way for a president to pass on the most painful steps to his successor, by putting off big tax increases or spending cuts until someone else is in the White House. <br>  <br>  Obama only has a real say on spending during the four years of his term. He may not be president after that and he certainly won't be 10 years from now. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: This may be so, but it isn't only Republicans who pushed for deregulation of the financial industries. The Clinton administration championed an easing of banking regulations, including legislation that ended the barrier between regular banks and Wall Street banks. That led to a deregulation that kept regular banks under tight federal regulation but extended lax regulation of Wall Street banks. Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, later an economic adviser to candidate Obama, was in the forefront in pushing for this deregulation. <br>  <br>  ------ <br>  <br>  OBAMA: "In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas." <br>  <br>  THE FACTS: First, his budget does not accomplish any of that. It only proposes those steps. That's all a president can do, because control over spending rests with Congress. Obama's proposals here are a wish list and some items, including corporate tax increases and cuts in agricultural aid, will be a tough sale in Congress.

Rwn0svq0aa	Barack Obama was Presidential. His oratory continues to improve. His political agenda as outlined in the speech is both crowded and ambitious. Can his rhetoric match performance? Inside of 45 days, this remains to be seen. However, the speech was one for the ages. It echoes that he is a deliberate public servant who challenges his peers to the best and highest traditions of service to the country. <br>  This much ambition has not been articulated in the Office of President in modern age, even during President Clinton's tenure his ambition laid out before the Congress was not as large in scale as this President. From the President's speech, it too is crystal clear governing the country in this day and time will be fraught with structural problems. Solutions will not come overnight and efforts based on results is nothing less than hard work.<br>  Nevertheless, if I had to characterize his speech it was powerful, intellectually honest and most importantly, relevant.

You can try and dispute that all you want but his policies clearly say otherwise.  I'm not necessarily faulting him for that, but that's the reality of who his is.  My fault with most liberals today is that they will not admit that fact to the American people.  Don't be afraid to be who you are.  The problem is, most Americans don't want socialism so liberals have to hide their true in tensions.  That's my big issue with libs.<br>  <br>  If you analyze his speech last night, it chalk full of what the Government is going to do for you.  That is classic socialism.  The problem is, socialism has been tried as far back as the founding of this country and it does not work.  In fact, millions have died and or suffered under socialism.  Under socialism, people are not truly free.  <br>  <br>  If you are honest with yourself, I think you will discover that you would rather just be left alone and not have some bureaucrat in Washington tell you how to live your life.

JMJsCU1vaa	it will never be accomplished as it was designed and deployed and is doing exactly what is was designed to do...Eliminate a large percentage of the population that was deemed to be of lower value, undesirables if you will, ie Gays, Blacks, Drug users... with Gays it was deployed in the Hepatitis B vaccine in 78 and 79, then 81-82 , 1980 was a study year to see if the virus was spreading as they wanted it to, it was determined it was not, so another 2 years of the contaminated Hep B vaccine was ordered.<br>  The entire continent of Africa is slated for expiration, as they deployed AIDS in the smallpox vaccine along the same time-line, and the infection rate in Africa is tremendous, which was the intent...<br>  To the people who believe the African Green Monkey theory I have to say this, if it were the African Green Monkey that spread this disease it would have spread from the Jungles into the cities, but it's spreading from the cities into the jungles, and did not show up in the people most closely associated with contact with the monkey (The Pygmies) until the early 90's from contact with prositutes from more urban areas, and the genetic makeup of the disease is not found in monkeys.<br>  As for the drug users, we are told that HIV cannot live outside the body but for seconds, but Dr.Robert Strecker took a HIV-diseased human tissue culture and placed it in a petrie dish and placed it on a window sill for 2 weeks, then brought it down and hit it with a saline solution and re-cultured the virus... hmmm well that does not support what we are told now does it?<br>  it is suggested that AIDS/HIV is placed into the drug shipments and allowed to circulate into the country, that would justify why the rate of infection among intravenous drug users is so high, even though that by now, everyone knows not to share needles, and there are needle exchange programs all over, but the numbers keep growing.. hmmmm sounds fishy to me.<br>  How did Haiti get an infection rate so high? they sent 7000 healthcare workers to Africa to help to distribute the smallpox vaccine, they themselves took the vaccine, so 7000+ infected individuals came back to a relatively small island with an HIV infection they knew nothing about.<br>  How did South America get such a high infection rate? They were buying almost all of their whole blood from Africa during those years... hmm that would explain it wouldn't it?<br>  Don't believe what you're told by the people that pose as your protectors, you are but an unfortunate side effect of what the elite feel is necessary... in that they need YOU to pay taxes and to be their slaves, but you also take up space on the planet, valuable space that they want for themselves, and they want to exterminate the portion of the population that is undesirable.... sound familiar?...<br>  Do with this information what you will, don't email me with questions for more information, I've given you enough that your thirst for more knowledge on this subject should direct you to other sources, so that you can't claim or think it came from just one person... <br>  if you have doubts that Americans or Un-Americans for that matter could or would perpetrate such a deviant act against it's own people I urge you to read "Bad Blood" for just one example of well documented case of such...<br>  Oh and if they ever claim to have a vaccine for AIDS, DON'T TAKE IT, for you can't expect the very entity that is responsible for this disease to produce a cure for it, especially since it's doing exactly what is was designed to do...<br>  Peace...|`|FMVXs2pZaa	No, what we should do is round em all up and put them in leper style colonies.

quHPxabZaa	yes. only if you can prove that it is almost impossible for you to pay. as in- you have no income. though i wouldn't consider it unless you aren't even able to make a payment plan.<br>  I just dealt with creditors this A.M. on the same stuff. my boyfriend has an outstanding debt on student loans, over 12,000 dollars.<br>  <br>  if you meet their criteria, you may be able to get a payment arrangement of as little as $20 per month, though I wasn't so lucky... mine was $60 because of how much, and how long the debt had been sitting!<br>  <br>  however, if you decide to try,<br>  The court uses a three-pronged test to determine hardship: <br>  <br>  *If you were forced to repay the loan, you would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living. <br>  <br>  *There is evidence that this hardship will continue for a significant portion of the loan repayment period. <br>  <br>  *You made good-faith efforts to repay the loan before filing bankruptcy (usually this means you have been in repayment for a minimum of five years).|`|RxeQJcqhaa	Tax obligations, student loans and child support are not discharged with bankruptcy.

In a lot of places in Europe, the unemployment rate is easily double digits.<br>  <br>  As far as health care, we have the best by far.

Just ask the Europeans coming here for their health care.|`|P5MMxGxHaa	A continent to be socialist?<br>  <br>  <br>  I do not think many countries in Europe are socialist.

7qxqkjNhaa	Yes all the way<br>  <br>  As far as Unemployment Insurance, I pay for that as a business owner to protect my employees if the business tanks and it is a "TAX" on small business. Business owners of failed businesses don't qualify for unemployment insurance payments, something "WE" pay for. Thank you for stating what I already know.|`|5e0c2b6e245998c415bb4509ecae5500aa	"And don't tell me you paid into unemployment insurance, because you didn't, your employer was taxed for this" -(you)<br>  <br>  "This is prompting state officials to CONSIDER raising employer taxes or curtailing benefits"  -(from your source) <br>  <br>  Funny when people put up sources that contradict what they say.  Makes it really easy to prove that you don't know what you're talking about. <br>  <br>  And to answer your question (which has already essentially been asked dozens of times),  Not accepting unemployment checks would not do anything to stop the problem that is big government.  But I wouldn't accept the check because I think there are other people who need the money more than I do.  Because I have a savings account, I don't buy things I can't afford, I don't take 400,000 dollar loans with a 40,000 dollar a year job with no down payment, I don't own one person one cent, I pay cash for cars, I pay cash for everything.  Basically I wouldn't accept it because I don't have the attitude that I have a right to buy a BMW, a nice house and eat at restaurants every week, and then expect someone else to help me when I lose my job. <br>  <br>  The problem with our country is this:  we live out of our means.  Just google average credit card debt, or average car loan debt. and we think we shouldn't be held accountable for our actions.  We Americans save 4% of our income, Japanese people save 40%.  So a smooth talker like B. Obama swoops in promising free this and free that and all of us irresponsible people immediately jump on the "no responsibility" band wagon.   And Obama is essentially unstoppable because about half the population will be paying next to nothing in taxes and receiving health care, unemployment, social security, welfare, basically whatever they need.  HALF! how are responsible people supposed to compete with that?<br>  <br>  And I always get the same angry email from somebody, So I'll just address this now.  Here in American ANYONE can become rich.  ANYONE!!!  Regardless of skin color, ethnic background, gender, physical appearance, etc.  Go to Haiti, or parts of Africa, these people truly have no way to become rich.  But not in the U.S.. No one deserves free government handouts for anything. I'm sorry but you don't.  Charities give enough money to cover the few exceptions where people do have some affliction that truly impedes them from being successful,  Government should have NO role in this. NONE|`|4BxkkB6Yaa	First off, unemployment DOES come from an employees paycheck. The business factors it in to the pay of every employee when the salary or hourly wage is decided. It's not on the paycheck in words but your pay is less because of it. Second, I'm a Libertarian and believe that if I were laid off that I would eventually find another job with the skill sets that I have worked hard to obtain. I don't feel sorry for those that refuse to better themselves and end up stuck homeless because of their laziness.Sure, there are exceptions but the majority of those on welfare are on welfare because they refuse to get off of the couch and work towards a better life.|`|AA11221077	A. There are many people who paid into unemployment for years before the burden fell to employers. Nice try. <br>  <br>  B. Unemployment is another job benefit. It's nice to not be an illegal worker, isn't it? All those perks pay off.<br>  <br>  When our government stops sending money to nations that support terrorists, to countries where warlords intercept the aid, to pay for abortions around the world, to support illegals right here at home and provide them with services, we'll talk about what Americans get.|`|FMVXs2pZaa	I have in the past.  I also refused to go beg for food stamps, or any of those other BS leech programs.|`|CvFajKPUaa	I am a small government conservative, I would never take someone else's money that I didn't earn<br>  <br>  I started and own a 80 well oil and gas company, I created over 40 jobs and employ people in 3 states, I live in So Cal, I am 26 and have paid over $100K in taxes a year since I was 22.  All my adult life I have kept a minimum of 12 months funding in reserve.  I also have property and chattel that can be sold to support myself for years should anything happen to my cash producing investments.  I have put in the work and done what was needed to be able to support myself regardless.<br>  Therefore I do not need government help because throughout my life I have made the mature and responsible decisions that everyone should make such that they will never need a hand out.  If that meant not getting a new boat for another year or staying in the office for days on end I did it.  I cannot see why anyone should expect someone else's money just because they were lazy or stupid.  People need to drop this entitlement mentality and take responsibility for themselves.|`|7M0KW1Iwaa	I'm a small government Conservative. I happen to vote Republican because they are the party that advocates smaller government even though the last 8 years that wasn't the case.<br>  <br>  I won't need unemployment because I save for rainy days. I don't spend money I don't have. I don't own a credit card either.|`|Mi4EebHlaa	Yes, I do!|`|iZEHA854aa	My, how clever you are, making a single point as an all-encompassing argument for big-government or selfishness on the part of those who are Republicans and want small government.<br>  Well, if all we want is small government, then why do we want a large effective military? That surely has a big price tag, and has a large number of government employees. Well, we like the safety a large military provides.<br>  In a similar way, we like being protected from business' going belly up. Getting fired usually is our own fault, but lay-offs are more likely the result of the BOTTOM-LINE mentality, where workers are the ones treated like machinery or property. Notice it is now called HUMAN RESOURCES, and not personnel anymore. We are not a resource, like a truck or computer, but a human being who works hard, and deserves a management that looks out for both the bottom-line and the employee.<br>  But when times get hard, the employee is left hanging in the wind without a parachute, unlike the golden parachutes CEO and upper management have. You know the sweet-heart deals that make sure their tomorrow will be just like today.<br>  So yes, I want a small government, which is not overly intrusive, but does oversee compliance for worker safety, ensures anti-monopoly policies, protects against toxic dumping, and ensures national security home and abroad.

Be aware, though, that there are very tight deadlines for making an application.|`|a60c3cfd12c31d6b6f73f4a2bf4f59ecaa	i'm sorry to hear that. why don't you go to your local Citizens Advice Bureau for moe advice on this. You can request a Subject Access Request to get all the info the company has on you. However they may not reveal everything, in which case you wouldn't know how much they have on you, but its worth a try, as they would clearly have negative info on you to support their case of dismissing you, so get hold of whatthey have accused you of, then you can fight it if you wish to get your job back or compensation. the data protection act 1998, is in place in patient confidentiality, employment records, employers cannot reveal private info about you to another colleague, unless it is between both your bosses and they cannot pass your info to other companies, without your consent, as they would have breached the data protection act and liable for court action. difficulty is proving the company has done wrong - goodluck! hope it works out for you.

Iraq is another.  It's because of the safety risks for the family members.  Chances of getting command sponsored are pretty low.  Especially for someone newly enlisted.  If you were to get command sponsored, it would extend his time there.<br>  <br>  It is only a year, it is the same as a deployment to Iraq.  And he's safer in Korea.  And he gets more leave (30 days in the middle of his 12 months).  And you'll have better communications available.<br>  <br>  If he switches with someone he could very well get stationed somewhere you could go and then have to deploy for a year anyway.<br>  <br>  Stay strong.

I feel for you.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	it's been quite a few years since i was in korea but as far as i can remember most korean tours are considered remote and/or one year. you wouldn't be able to go. as far as them telling you that you would be able to go, that was before he got orders and anyway, the recruiter has no idea what he chooses for a job or how the service will use him.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Your question is incomprehensible.  You need to rewrite it as more than one sentence.|`|jt55tkDnaa	One thing you must learn especially in the Army is any promises you get from someone GET IT IN WRITING, I cannot stress that enough. If it is not in writing they can and will do whatever they want. Does your husband have PCS orders to Korea or just TDY?? If its PCS then usually the family goes with the soldier although I have heard of instances of families not being allowed to go with their husbands to Korea usually they are call unaccompanied assignments. If it is TDY it is just training somewhere other than his normal duty station he shouldn't be gone for very long and during those types of things wives and children cannot go with them.

The exchange from the aids hands to Stalin's made the chicken squawk nervously and noisily.<br>   Stalin then proceeded to pull out all the feathers from a life chicken and not killing the bird. He then threw it on the floor and had his aid go get some feed for the bird.<br>   The bird within a half hour was eating out of his hand for food and trying to warm itself in his hands.<br>   To get people to conform he stated you must take away everything from them and then offer only a little back as it is their only means of survival. Self preservation over rules even the staunches of viewpoints.<br>   Thus Stalin killed 20 million people plus to prove that point. <br>   Although  Obama willnever go that far but the liberals wish to silence the conservatives by taking away at various principles that we hold dear to our hearts.

The political government in Iraq is weak, are not truly accepted as the leaders and the tribes that have lived there for thousands of years will go back to their old ways. Another dictator may come into power, or may not. The entire war was nothing but to serve Bush and Cheney to get what they wanted which they did. Bush got Saddam in retaliation for trying to assassinate Bush1 and Cheney's company Haliburton got all the contracts to rebuild Iraq after Bush destroyed it.

When I’m wrong I’m the first eventual one to admit it, so I’ll go ahead and say it, “I was wrong.” Yes, I doubted that Obama could bring about the “change” I needed to not have to worry about paying bills anymore like Peggy The Moocher told us. <br>  <br>  Well Barack Obama has put my money where his Cabinet is with the news that his newly minted Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, has possibly been evading taxes on his home for years. How could he do it? Easy! He created a sketchy charity in 2002, named it after him and his wife, set its address as his personal residence, and voila, taxes could be gone:<br>  <br>  According to the Cook County Assessor’s website, the Chicago home of four-term Democrat Congressman and likely new White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, doesn’t exist. While the address of 4228 North Hermitage is listed as Emanuel’s residence on the Illinois State Board of Elections’ website, there seems to be no public record of Emanuel ever paying property taxes on this home…<br>  <br>  Why would 4228 North Hermitage property owners Rahm Emanuel and wife Amy Rule not pay property taxes?<br>  <br>  One reason could be because Emanuel and Rule declared their 4228 North Hermitage home as the office location for their non-profit foundation appropriately called the “Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Foundation”. As a non-profit headquarters, they may consider their home as exempt from paying taxes.<br>  <br>  Skeptical? You shouldn’t be! After six years, the “Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Foundation” has had only two donors. Can you guess who?<br>  <br>  The Rahm Emanuel and Amy Rule Charitable Trust was formed in 2002, when the Chicago lawmaker was first elected. The former Clinton White House aide and his wife, Amy Rule, are its only donors.<br>  <br>  USA Today has a great article about Rahm and other Dems, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who are illegally operating charities under their own names while failing to report that information. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, America, you’ve just elected another corrupt politician who surrounds himself with corrupt supporters. “Yes we can” steal from the government and those we represent!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-28-pelosi-side_x.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/...</a>|`|ikcrfQPVaa	Buy a house you cannot afford with an ARM, then sell it before the rate resets at a 200% profit.<br>  <br>  No, Wait.

Cleary in the short time that Obama has been in office, he has demonstrated that he is against the idea of making any income or profit that can lead to being "rich." Therefore he wants everyone to be poor in order to allow for a Socialist/Command style economy in which individuals depend entirely on the governemnt for all forms of economic assistance.<br>  <br>  I honestly believe that in order to capital to grow, capital must go where it is welcome.  Under the reign of Obama, that is unfortunitley not the United States.
cMHxg372aa	Yes, he understands basic economics. The problem is that you do not understand anything more advanced on the topic.<br>  <br>  "He really thinks that money grows on trees"<br>  <br>  Actually, no. He's expressed reservation about the Fed's monetary easing on many occasions. If you'd like to check around You Tube, I'm sure it'd be easy to find tape of an instance where he's said "we can't just go on printing money" point blank.<br>  <br>  "evil Bush withheld the money from impoverished communities simply out of his evilness stupidity and greed."<br>  <br>  Well, probably because it's true.

The less money in circulation, the less it can be used to grow the economy, and less likely other countries will buy products from us due to a strong value of a dollar. Right now we are in the middle of a credit crunch, where the banks have been severely burned by the housing crisis and recession and have slowed down the lending of money.With little available credit, nobody has the kind of cash to start new investments and grow our economy, while Americans scared of losing their jobs and with no good access to loans have stopped consuming at levels previous to this, thus creating a vicious circle that could eventually lead to a depression.<br>  <br>  In this case, the only organization with the resources to help us out in this recession is the federal government. And for someone like Obama not to act or even to act in a milquetoast manner and not bring strong enough action would cause the popularity of the Democrats to plummet. Obama would be known as a Herbert Hoover were he to fail to act in this time of crisis, or a Bush during Katrina for a more modern crisis. What about this do you not get?<br>  <br>  And the federal government can never run out of money btw since they can borrow more or even print more, although obviously doing so can have grave implications for their economy. Of course deflation also has grave implications for our economy as well, and the best way to fight deflation is what Obama is doing.<br>  <br>  Read up on Keynesian economics for more info<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_e...</a>|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	What would you expect.

They will only pay 3% more on any amount over $250k.  They're not going to go bankrupt or anything, and they will benefit if the economy gets healthier just like the rest of us.

FKN9kBvLaa	You lost them at "consider", they are not great thinkers.  Everything is black and white to them.  If you don't have job, you must be "lazy, stupid or criminal", if you're rich, then it must have been "decent, honest hard-work".  The sad irony is, MOST OF THEM are blue collar and uneducated (not tying to insult, this is statistically true), yet they continue to lobby and stand up for rich, greedy, corporate fat cats that don't give a $hit about them.  I guess anything beats supporting a black man, even if his plans will benefit 95% of them.

For a mother to give up her child she is either not mentally stable or making the hardest decision of her life. Trusting in God to give her another chance at life. To try to grow up more or be more stable & maybe call back this child later. Or the person may beleive that the child is just not at all going to be taken care of well so they are better not coming here for the earth experience. Many people who are against giving health care for people who have abortions, don't know that someone in there own family has had an abortion & kept it secret. So humility & non-judgment are something you have non of so you would not understand this kind of faith. What faith supports the killing of grown ups who have parents, children, siblings? Learn about the history of abortion & see how many people died from it not being legal. If you cared so much about these children you would be adopting them & working so we would have no poor people in this country.|`|AA10057370	will the USA last till the next election?|`|M3maZgdyaa	I had to laugh when I read this question.

Partial Birth Abortion has been outlawed since 2003....please get a new issue to demonize the President with.<br>  The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (Pub.L. 108-105, 117 Stat. 1201, enacted November 5, 2003, 18 U.S.C. § 1531[1], PBA Ban) is a United States law prohibiting a form of late-term abortion that the Act calls partial-birth abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the term "partial-birth abortion" in the act pertains to a procedure that is medically called intact dilation and extraction. Under this law, "Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both." The law was enacted in 2003, and in 2007 its constitutionality was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart.

Here's the deal.<br>  <br>  Part of the stimulus money offered to states is for the expansion of unemployment benefits.  There is a stipulation on the money that requires states to extend benefits to part time workers.  Since unemployment legislation is written at state level, states will have to actually change their state laws to accommodate the expansion.  The stimulus money is all they're getting.  From there, it will be up to each state to increase their annual budget to accommodate the expansion.  In the case of my state, the governor is declining $66 million to save the state from having to come up with $17 million each year going forward.  Add to that the fact that there's this little thing called the constitution that kind of says this is an infringement on state's rights to manipulate legislation and you've got some pretty wise governors who are declining the money.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	Isn't it nice that people turn down taxpayer dollars because they know that they can fend for themselves?

Now you have to pay for something that you didn't have to. <br>  There is such a thing as adoption and you could have stayed in their lives. You should see if you can speak to high school students to help them avoid the mistakes that you made. <br>  <br>  Find the local community college and go in to Student Services - ask the Registrar if unsure. You will want to speak with an advisor.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Ok I really don't mean this to sound rude to you personally but this is exactly why we believe democrats think a suitable life is to have everything paid for by those of us who work for it.

Or it could also be done if the Chancellor put a 99.9% windfall tax on the pensions of all former executives of banks now taken over by taxpayer.

a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Here's an example of the people who want prohibition to continue:<br>  Drugs are all bad unless a doctor prescribes them. They make crime higher and people have to steal to get them. Everyone knows drugs harm your brain and always lead to worse things.<br>  If drugs were legal everyone would drive stoned, airplanes wouldn't be safe and even police would sit around ripped all day.<br>  <br>  What you don't hear from them is:<br>   If the same drugs were legal proper labeling would be on all drugs. If they were legal we wouldn't have strychnine and arsenic being cut into them to further profits for criminals. Crime rates would drop immensely and the profits to organized crime would dry up over night. It would no longer be a crime so crime rates would plummet.<br>  The same drugs currently illegal were never that dangerous until they became black market and only organized crime could distribute them. Ask yourself if plain water was suddenly outlawed would you even dream of buying it from global organized criminals?<br>  You never hear that drug users are more than willing to pay more than their fair share of taxes. You never hear the federal government doesn't want that tax revenue instead is spending those would be profits to imprison non violent criminals at a faster rate than any time in recorded history. What you don't hear is that treatment and rehab centers would be more common than McDonalds without any fear of criminals hanging out near them.<br>  What you don't hear is that organized crime wants drugs illegal to keep a stronghold on a global monopoly and that politicians are all in the pockets of organized global criminals AND it's either gold or lead for politicians. Gold=Payoffs to keep prohibition Lead=Death to any politician who votes to end prohibition.<br>  What you don't hear about the issue of people driving stoned is that driving stoned is already illegal. Nothing would change. What you don't hear about airline pilots flying high is that too is illegal under current law and not one law would ever be proposed or  suggested to make either legal EVER.<br>  What you don't hear is the people who push prohibition actually using common sense.<br>  Bottom line, prohibition is backed by global organized criminals, police, prison guards and associated industries and NOBODY else except the bone headed.<br>  Something else you never hear from them: The public never receives one bit of benefit from prohibition, never has and never will. NEVER!|`|cMHxg372aa	YES!<br>  <br>  The war on drugs is the most idiotic, wasteful, pandering, immoral, unconscionable public policy since slavery.|`|BrjZhySIaa	...and then some.<br>  <br>  But you will have some ignoramuses on here who think that means "legalize everything"...

Most people crimes are committed by addicts who need the money to feed their habit.  <br>  <br>  Our "just say no" President Reagan funded IranContra with drugs.  If we took the billions of dollars spent each year that we piss away on the war on drugs and used it to provide help and counseling for the people who are abused, disenfranchised, hopeless (the reason most people need to zone out) and spent it on education so that these people could get out of their situation and become contributing citizens to the world - well, just imagine.

And it wasn't working any worse than previous times during the Katrina crisis. That's what so many of you people just don't get.<br>  <br>  The Katrina aftermath mess was typical of FEMA, typical of government action. It's just that FEMA has never had to permanently relocate so many people before, and had no plans for it. So, in a manner foreshadowing Obama's "stimulus", they just put out a lot of ideas, threw out a lot of money and hoped something would work.<br>  <br>  Oh, for the people out there who don't understand it, the local and state authorities are supposed to handle these emergencies for the first 72 hours at least. The premise has always been that FEMA doesn't really kick in until 3-4 days after. And they cannot do anything at all until the Governor of the state requests the help; that's the only thing that releases the federal government from being constrained by the posse comitatus law.|`|AA11828439	I thought the Governor came across as petty, uninformed, and desperate to find something to criticize. Not finding enough in the President's speech, he attacked FEMA, even though it was run by his own party. And the Volcano monitoring assertion was a stretch as well. Just because Scientific Investigation is beyond the capacity of his Party to understand, does not make it Pork.

What he was trying to illustrate is that the Federal Government is not the right solution to problems.  The Federal Government is a HUGE bureaucratic mess and is very inefficient when it comes to solving problems.  And you are right, the Bush years weren't all that great.  It's not a Republican position Jindal was promoting; it was a Conservative position.  The GOP has drifted left and if it isn't corrected, the GOP will need to be overhauled.<br>  <br>  We, as a country, need to stop relying on the Federal Government to fix every problem there is.  True solutions come from the people, not the government.  We, as a country, have slowly become less and less self-reliant and more and more government-reliant.  It doesn't matter who is in the White House, or who is in Congress.  The people need to say, "Enough.  Get out of our way, and let us do what we need to do and get this country back on track!"<br>  <br>  Less government, more personal responsibility.  That's the way out of this mess.<br>  <br>  ps- to "I Love Kate" his real name may not be Bobby.  But the Left and the Press made it perfectly clear in the 2008 election that 'real name' is NOT an issue.  So to play that tactic is quite hypocritical.

GJKWgx0Paa	where does the contract say the place of jurisdiction is?<br>  <br>  ***<br>  the only exceptions to where the contract says the place of jurisdiction are, afaik, when a government asserts that it needs to protect one party and therefore passes a law controlling the place of jurisdiction.<br>  <br>  of course, such laws do not apply to government units (since they do not abuse the people), so the place of jurisdiction for a traffic ticket is the place where the ticket was issued.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  example:  the United States asserts that regulation of gambling is a right of the individual states.  Some of these states, in order to protect their citizens, state that no debt contracted due to gambling can be enforced or collected.<br>  <br>  Thus, when a citizen of one of those states gambles online with a casino 'located' or organized in a country where gambling is legal [Antigua, perhaps], the courts in that state will refuse to force the losing gambler to pay.  And that prohibition against paying includes via his credit card, even if the credit card is issued in another state that does not so protect its citizens.

xxDjV6Axaa	How bout the doctor who removed the wrong leg on the patient in surgery?  Thereafter, parts to be amputated are marked with a large X with magic marker.<br>  <br>  I think the most interesting one I ever heard was a doctor suing a doctor (almost unheard of).  The treating doctor diagnosed Parkinson's.   The patient doctor kept getting worse and worse until he was paralyzed from the neck down.  While at the hospital, his wife insisted on caring for him.  Since she was a nurse, the help was welcome.  After collecting a 24 hour urine, a lab technician found something strange.  The urine was a female's!  <br>  <br>  So they decided to run a tox screen on his blood.  Arsenic!

lvBUl3Zdaa	Yes, you will be required to get a new license and register your car in the state you are moving to. Check with their motor vehicle department for the laws. ∠°)|`|6fdf52407e060be171055cf37652285eaa	No you don't, if you still maintain a 'place of residence' in your home state.<br>  Like for instance your parents house.<br>  <br>  "it is cheaper to register as a residence for school. If not, you are going to pay more for tuition."<br>  True, --- BUT there is a minimum time of residency requirement, PRIOR to getting a discount for "In State"<br>  Unless you are an illegal alien then, in a lot of states you can register as "In State" for the school.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	It honestly depends on where you're going but for most grad schools, you have to change.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Depends on the state.  Arizona will impound your car and jail you if you don't get plates and a driver's license THE DAY YOU MOVE THERE.  And if you think I'm joking, just test them.<br>  <br>  Check out whichever state you're going to and find out their requirements.<br>  <br>  Also, take this into consideration.  Insurance companies will not like it if your car is not garaged in the state it is insured in, and you can't get insurance in the state it's garaged in unless you register it in that state.<br>  <br>  Also, it's hard if not impossible to get a job in a different state from the one your driver's license is from.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	If you are going temporarily and plan on keeping your permanent address as is, you do not have to change anything. If you only have a temporary address in the new state don't change anything. Look at all the other cars in the parking lot of the better known institutions of higher learning. The schools that attract students from all over the country have cars with plates from all over the country in the parking lot. Going to school in another state does not make you a resident of that state. You will still be paying out of state tuition unless it is a private school.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Yes. Most states only allow between 10 and 30 days grace to get a license and plates.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	No, you can maintain your permanent address in your home state and use it for you registration.|`|QlPTVcrHaa	Depends. Vehicle registration is a factor to your insurance carrier. Some companies require you to be registered in a particular state or change policies (if you move to another).<br>  <br>  Your license determines your residency. If the car is in your name, registered in the new state, you will need to establish residency in the new state first.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	Yes, if you plan 'permanent' residence. It most states that is anything over 30 days. <br>  One of the few exceptions is military service.|`|VbfhlTN9aa	Yes, because it is cheaper to register as a residence for school. If not, you are going to pay more for tuition.|`|YMFo5N2haa	Yes. anytime you become a resident at another state you must register there.|`|L592wjsjaa	I needed new plates when I moved to a Red State last week.

Illegal aliens don't have illegal alien immunity. if they're found committing a crime, they're arrested like anyone else. that's why we have so many in our jails already. It's what happens after they're arrested and in jail that matters. a number of states cooperate with immigration to identify illegal immigrant felons and have them deported immediately after they've finished their sentences. Doesn't happen every time. but most of the dangerous felons that are deported every year are deported this way.|`|0LHXNXVfaa	uh-huh|`|CNSGz12zaa	They should be enforcing ALL laws federal state and local.

But, and maybe you don't know this, simply being in the country without a valid visa isn't a crime--it's a violation of immigration law, but not a crime.  Thus, local police shouldn't be involved in determining a person's citizenship.  But even someone like me, who believes in a radical opening of the borders, supports a local police officers to arrest anyone, native or immigrant, legal or illegal, for committing a crime.|`|J7pNK6fYaa	Regardless if they are ILLEGAL INVADERS or citizens if the police see a drug deal they shoud step in.<br>  <br>  Also, if they are ILEGAL INVADERS they should deport them ASAP!|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	The police can arrest anyone they see or suspect of committing a crime regardless of weather they are legal or illegal.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	City, County, and State law enforcement officers can make arrests of illegal aliens if they have been trained under the federal program known as the 287(g) program.

In the two years that they "controlled" the house and senate, the Dems didn't have enough of a majority to prevent a filibuster, and they certainly didn't have the votes to override a veto by the Republican president.<br>  <br>  But if you're really want to convince me that, in those two years, they Democrats destroyed the economy, can you cite specific evidence?  What legislation did they pass, against solid Republican opposition, that caused our solid Bush economy to go down the crapper?<br>  <br>  (I won't even ask you to defend your assertion that, under Bush, we "recovered" from the Clinton economy.

xxDjV6Axaa	You first have to go through Phase I and II.  If you score at the top of your class, you get first choice for an aircraft.  Then it is decided by how many slots are open for each type.  Phase III is training in the specific aircraft.  Some instructor pilots are selected for fighter training when they need more though.<br>  <br>  By that time you should be used to Gs but not all can handle the intensity in the fighters.

Jklpfaecaa	ask ur recruiter|`|XA69SIvnaa	I really wish civilians wouldn't try and answer these questions arbitrarily.<br>  <br>  There are various requirements to join the Army. You have to meet a height and weight standard based on your age. For initial entrance it is equivalent to 26% body fat but once your in, contingent on your age group, it has to be a certain percentage (i.e. 21-24 is 22%). Recruiters sign off on PT evaluations at the office without actually doing them mostly, this is because there is no accountability of these tests anyway - and in my opinion they are pointless.<br>  <br>  You can't have any serious physical or mental ailments upon joining up, you will be DQ'ed and will need a waiver to get in, if you get in at all.<br>  <br>  The APFT (Army physical fitness test) is based on again, your age group. It is ridiculously easy to pass a (physical training) PT test. You need to do 42 pushups in 2 minutes, 50 situps in 2 minutes, and run 2 miles in under 16:36 or something like that for the 21-24 age group. The training is easy, from a physical perspective, especially once you've done it long enough.<br>  <br>  Possibility of dying on deployment is very real, but percentage wise you are more likely to die driving a car in NYC than you are in Iraq or Afghanistan.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	If you are not already strong enough to pass the APFT test, then you will be able to once basic is over with.  And the possibility of dying is in relation to the MOS you have.  I say talk to the soldiers in your hometown and ask them.

The KKK did not start to restore white supremacy in the South and Nathan Bedford Forrest did not start it and was actually a member for a very short period of time; use a reference besides Wiki please.  Forrest was a member of the KKK and left it when it became violent and when the reason it started was retracted.  Tthe reason he and many other Confederate veterans joined it was because after the war and in contradiction too the promises of Grant at Appomattox and the known/written wishes of Lincoln, they were not allowed to vote or have any form of representation.  You may judge that as fair but when you leave no one any way to express themselves it will lead to extremism and violence.|`|ikcrfQPVaa	It is true that those that started the KKK were mostly democrats.  The Democrat party rose in the south out of the ashes of the confederacy.

c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	I think you are still a minor. So your parents are legally responsible for your housing and to get you to school. Parents can get in trouble if their kids do not attend school.<br>  <br>  I would call your school and tell them what is going on. That will get other people involved. They may allow you to continue living with your friend, or they may put you in foster care or a home. Either way they will probably make your parents pay for your care. Your parents would probably want to take you back if they had to pay.<br>  <br>  You can also ask your parents to sign your legal guardianship over to your friend's mother. That way she can legally sign you up for school.<br>  <br>  There is a lot to consider here. A high school diploma is better than a GED. If you are on track to go to college you may need to see how that might be interfered with. What about health insurance? Do you currently get it from your parents? That is a major consideration. Imagine if you got hit by a drunk driver and your back was fractured. You may need emergency care, surgery, and rehabilitation. Not to mention that if you are in the hospital you are probably not doing very well at school or work.<br>  <br>  You could also go to your county child protective services or the police station. They would want to make sure you are taken care of since you are a minor.<br>  <br>  You could also go to a teen shelter or your county housing authority. Right now they are booked, but may be able to help. You are considered homeless if you are temporarily living with someone else and have no other option.<br>  <br>  Take advantage of the fact that you are still a minor and get assistance. If you do end up needing to go to foster care remember that most foster parents are very nice and are doing it to give you a chance. You may actually find the most support you ever had in your life. I think California foster kids also automatically get scholarships to public colleges and universities, but I am not sure.<br>  <br>  This is your life. When you turn 18 there will be fewer options available. And you won't be able to prove anything against your parents. If you have younger siblings I would get help because the same thing might happen to them.|`|HeoS75kGaa	You have no legal rights that you didn't already have as a minor.  You're still a minor.  If you left home voluntarily, the authorities would not bother forcing you to return as you could very easily leave again.  In your case, if you wanted to make an issue of being kicked out, as a minor, you'd have good grounds to do so.  But if you're not inclined to go back to that environment, then you're basically the same as someone who left voluntarily.  Still a minor, no more rights than before.<br>  <br>  Mostly it's up to you if you want to accept the offer to move to AZ.|`|14429844ed295bd6b6714b0da476f998aa	Under California Law you are a minor, your parents are legally liable for you. They cannot "kick" you out on the street. If you are living with other adults, they can legally sue your parents for child support till you are 18, or 25 if a full time student. <br>  <br>  Now on the other hand, if you are determined to be a continual problem, like getting arrested a lot, they can file file for a judgment to deem you encourage-able, and make you a ward of the court. but still child support will be awarded. <br>  <br>  Arizona sucks... really it does!

One person might believe life begins at conception, another at a certain size, another at viability, another at birth.  There is no universal definition.  It really offends one group when another group thinks differently, but that doesn't mean one group gets to trump the others.  And the government should stay out of matters that vary according to each situation.  It's between an individual and their doctor.<br>  <br>  I do think we should work toward increasing the things that lower the risk of people being faced with abortion.  Things like ensuring adequate housing, health care, food, jobs, domestic violence programs, chemical dependency programs, sexual assault programs, education, etc.  No one likes abortion.  We can reduce its incidence.  We will probably never eliminate it.

I would not support an abortion after the middle of the second trimester or later because the baby has really developed them, but early on, it's not really a baby: it is just a bunch of cells that has the potential to BECOME a human. <br>  <br>  In addition, pro-life people always say..You could be killing the person who will find the cure to cancer...<br>  My response to that is that you could also be killing the person who will, in a fit of insanity, decide to blow up the world...or more realistically, the person who will grow up to be a sexual predator or serial killer.|`|yag4fCFjaa	i dont agree with abortion, if you silly enough to make the mistake of getting pregnant then atleast be mature and grown up enough to look after it! its a life, and its precious! <br>  <br>  as far as rape goes, then yes maybe abortion may be an option but any other reason, no i dont not agree|`|m1Lz91diaa	pro-life...how can you possibly kill someone so innocent and precious that is living inside of you because you made a stupid and foolish mistake? i wonder what these people are thinking...that's if they're even thinking at all. when it comes to rape, i would say that the woman should should give it up for adoption if she doesn't want it.|`|oRRVpkXHaa	I am completely against abortion.

I will not go into a heated argument here as I think that I'd rather have such arguments face to face, where you can instantly come up with reasons to defend your pro-life position. <br>  <br>  Do we need more kids in the foster system who may go through various foster homes if not adopted, have difficult childhoods, get sexually abused or neglected, and grow up with several mental problems engaging in activities that may not be in their or the public's best interest? I suggest before you start talking about adoption, you should go check some studies to learn more about kids that get stuck in the system, get a few fun facts. You talk as if the mother says "I shall give it away in 9 months" and fairies instantly come and take the child to a much better place.<br>  <br>  Shawn: Your argument is the worst one. If you can't make it here, it's your fault. Yeees, that one..:) Well, guess what, poverty rate in 2007 was 12.5% in this land of opportunities, also keep in mind that just because you're over the poverty line doesn't mean you have a decent living standard. Not everybody is lucky enough to be born into a normal income family. The unfortunate part of this is that those that need it the most are the first ones to be denied an education. Those are also the ones that end up not going for abortion as they lack necessary information to explore their options. What do we have as a result; more kids that will grow up in impoverished areas. So do I want someone to say, they are not financially stable enough to have a child? You bet your ****, I do. <br>  <br>  The worst thing about all this is that the educated, more intelligent people are usually the ones to get abortions, not the 15 yr olds who end up molding other 15 yr olds just like them. <br>  <br>  In a time when people wage wars for money, you should be less worried about "FETAL" issues.
86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	William O. Douglas. <br>  A colleague who served with Douglas for 23 years, Felix Frankfurter, once said that Douglas was "the most cynical, shameless, immoral character I've ever known." -- quoted in "Super Chief," by Bernard Schwartz, page 53. At one point in 1941, Frankfurter had read an opinion written by Douglas and wrote a memo to him which began, "I am bound to say that it is bad for the both of us that we are no longer professors. Because if you were still a professor you would have written a very different elaboration and if I were still a professor I would have gotten several lectures out of what you have written." -- quoted in "Of Power and Right," by Ball & Cooper. In 1959, Frankfurter wrote another memo to Douglas which said, "You have had by now ample proof of my predominantly academic-minded way of dealing with issues before this Court, by which I mean my concern for the intellectual processes by which we reach decisions, and not merely the results that we reach." -- Ibid. Ball & Cooper obtained those quotes from Frankfurter's private papers in the Library of Congress.<br>  <br>  I understand what Frankfurter meant by each of those statements. I do believe that Douglas was a deeply cynical man, a result-oriented Supreme Court Justice -- which means that he chose the result that he wanted, according to his own ideology -- and that his style of writing opinions was embarrassingly sloppy.<br>  <br>  He paved the way for Roe v. Wade. He wrote the Court's opinions in the two cases that were the most important precedents cited in the Roe opinion, and on both of those occasions Douglas flat-out invented new law. They were Skinner v. Oklahoma, 1942, and Griswold v. Conn., 1965.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	John Roberts.

DB7UMkGCaa	Rush, among other conservatives, have NEVER been against stem cell research. They were against using embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells only created cancerous tumors. Its the adult stem cells from which the miracle cures have been discovered. <br>  <br>  _______________________________<br>  <br>  Bush Was Right <br>  In the summer of 2001, there was a dispute over federal funding for embryonic stem cell research (ESCR). Those in favor of it argued that ESCR held the promise to cure countless diseases and injuries from Alzheimer's to quadriplegia. Those opposed to it argued that it should be opposed as a matter of principle because it was (and is) necessary to destroy a human being to obtain the stem cells; that any cures from ESCR were years if not decades away; and that research into adult stem cells showed more promise. Indeed, treatments using adult stem cells are already being done.<br>  <br>  Now comes news that regular adult cells can be reprogrammed from one type of cell into another. This means that the advantage supposedly inherent to working with embryonic stem cells, that they can become any type of cell in the body, is nullified. Indeed, this advantage was nullified when it was found that adult stem cells could be reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells. These methods of reprogamming give adult stem cell research and cellular therapies using normal adult cells the same potential as embryonic stem cells without having to destroy human embryos and without the problem of controlling what sort of cell the embryonic stem cell will become (the latter problem being the major reason no potentially viable treatments have emerged through ESCR).<br>  <br>  All of this goes to show both the wisdom of President Bush's decision to accept federal funding of ESCR for existing stem cell lines only.* The field of medical research operates in the market, and actors in the market respond to incentives. Cures utilizing ESCR were seen as being far off, and for them to be a worthwhile investment would have required large federal subsidies.** By limiting the scope of federal funding, President Bush created an incentive for investors to look into other forms of research that offered a better chance of short-to-medium run return on investment such as adult stem cell research (pushing lots of federal money that way as well). These forms of research also avoided the moral dilemma of destroying embryos. Now this research is bearing fruit, and the need for obtaining stem cells by destroying embryos and employing human cloning to obtain usable stem cells is on the verge of being obviated if it hasn't been already.<br>  <br>  Can there be any doubt that, if the president had given in to the pressure and accepted unrestricted federal funding for ESCR, none of this would have happened? With massive federal subsidies going to the politically popular ESCR, would researchers have bothered to try anything else? Plenty of scientists back the popular line on global warming because it gets them government funding. Why take a chance on adult stem cells or this new cellular reprogramming method if ESCR gives you guaranteed money if you only promise that cures for all sorts of diseases are right around the corner?<br>  <br>  Given the politics at the time, President Bush made as morally right a decision as he could, and the fruit of research in fields in competition with ESCR over the intervening years have born fruit. In short, Bush got this one right.<br>  <br>  *In theory, it would have been best for him to deny federal funding altogether, but it was seen as being a politically untenable position.<br>  <br>  **Otherwise, people scientists, companies, and universities engaged in ESCR would have been able to find private investors to fund their research.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dwobd.blogspot.com/2008/08/bush-was-right.html" rel="nofollow">http://dwobd.blogspot.com/2008/08/bush-w...</a>|`|wVik8Fo7aa	As soon as Rush declares IVF procedures as immoral will he be able to spew his misinformation about embryonic stem cell research or seek treatment for his ailments.<br>  <br>  Number of "snowflake" babies last year=70<br>  <br>  Amount of leftover embryonic cells to be discarded as medical waste at IVF clinics=600,000+|`|aFC72tLZaa	This research has been going on for years J.A.

DDbWKBKjaa	Only a legal person can be a party to a law suit.<br>  <br>  More practically speaking, how exactly would you anticipate being able to collect on your judgment?  Put a lien on his doghouse?  Garnish his walks?<br>  <br>  If there's a cause of action that would appear to be against an animal, that will typically exist only against the dog's owner.|`|HeoS75kGaa	Nope.  A dog is property.  You could sue the owner for actions of the dog.  If the dog is a stray, then it's the property of no one, so you'd have no one to sue.<br>  <br>  Remember the dog food poisoning issue several months ago?  Some dog food made in China caused pets to become sick and die.  Many owners wanted to sue the manufacturer for wrongful death, but since pets are only property, the most compensation would only be the provable material value of the pet.|`|AA11598520	Of course. It is a dog eat dog world, after all.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	You can't sue a dog any more than you can sue a baby. They don't have the competence to be able to testify or defend themselves in court, and they don't own any assets anyway. If you have any injuries or property damage caused by a dog, you go after the person responsible for controlling it - the owner.|`|HKVFVS4qaa	mizzin I agree with.<br>  Sadly animals aren't treated the same way as humans.<br>  Hey, you never know, it could have easily been reversed down the road of Evolution, and you could be the one slobbering waiting for your owner to fill up your bowl.|`|OiAl6w48aa	No, but you can always sue the dog's owner(s).<br>  <br>  There are also some cases where you can participate in administrative or court proceedings to have a dog declared "dangerous" and put down.|`|UdUNvtIyaa	Umm I think you know the answer.<br>  <br>  Its because sadly animals are not treated like humans just because they dont communicate with us !!<br>  You can sue the dogs owner(like the slave trade!) tho...|`|DhR2Lttgaa	No, you cannot sue a dog, just as you cannot sue a minor. Why?<br>  <br>  Because when you sue somebody, they give you monetary compensation. Neither dogs nor minors can legally own property, therefore they have no way to compensate you. Whoever is responsible for them can be sued, however.|`|YuUNESK5aa	i don't think it's very fair to sue the dog in the first place<br>  the irresponsible owners are the ones that should get sued|`|yRYsi5zpaa	Yes sure, and when the judgment will ask "why did u do that Mr Dog", the animal will reply "woof woof woof"...

Whether or not your stepfather has crossed any *legal* boundaries in hitting you is not a guess I'm prepared to hazard.<br>  <br>  However, it's clear in my opinion that he's crossed some pretty significant moral boundaries, and your mother should know about it.  If she approves of his 'parenting' methods...well, I suppose that's one thing (in which case I'd probably suggest telling your father, if that's an option)...but if she doesn't approve of it, then I'm sure it's something she rather know about than not.<br>  <br>  (Also, in terms of legal boundaries, hitting a spouse has no such permissible equivalent in law, in most jurisdictions.)|`|RD5sTZaFaa	No, he is not allowed to hit you in that manner.

Sad, but typical. These are “professional” politicians at it’s worst. Pelosi is the epitome of human garbage, a trivial insignificant parasite making herself seem important by making demands. There must be at least one congress member with enough intestinal fortitude to tell this piece of human waste to go to hell. <br>  <br>  Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is fickle, demanding, and notoriously insensitive to the time, costs, and energy needed to accommodate her endless demands. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, released a trove of public records through the Freedom of Information Act on Pelosi’s travel arrangements with the U.S. military.<br>  As Speaker of the House, Pelosi is entitled to a reasonable level of military protection and transport. But it’s the size of the planes, the frequency of requests and last-minute cancellations, and the political nature of many of her trips that scream out for accountability.<br>  <br>  Reading through the e-mail exchanges between DoD officials and Pelosi’s staff, you can’t help but feel very, very sorry for the men and women in uniform who have to put up with this woman — and even sorrier for all of us taxpayers who are footing her carbon footprint-expanding bills. No word on whether Pelosi required vanilla-scented candles, Evian water, and fresh white lilies aboard the flight.

If the US and Iraq govt's did not come up with some form of agreement, the UN had the right to expel the US immediately, or the US could have requested a renewal to stay in Iraq.  Apparently, an agreement was made with the last administration and the Iraqi govt prior to that expiration regarding troop withdraw and other issues concerning Iraq.  There were several articles about this prior to the elections last year but with the elections, it wasn't the highlight.  I don't think there have been any treaties written between the two country's or that Congress has put their stamp on any if there have been some written. Clearly there was something in place prior to President Obama's taking office.<br>  <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/withdraw/2008/1230egypt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/iss...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20745.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.laprogressive.com/2008/12/05/us-troops-to-stay-in-iraq-until-2012/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laprogressive.com/2008/12/05/...</a><br>  <br>  I'm not sure what to make of the situation, other than to say he did state he was going to withdraw our troops from Iraq and focus on Afghanistan.  It's clear he is keeping to his word about removing the troops from Iraq.  <br>  I would think some troops staying there is to be expected. Not being in the military or familiar with the process, I would not even guess as to how long such a time frame would be for troops staying on. <br>  <br>  I don't think that there's some dire situation there though that we aren't being told about.   The fact that Iraq has always fought within itself, is not something that the US can do anything about. Those groups will continue to war with each other as they've done for ages or make peace with one another. <br>  I think it probably all has to do with prior agreements made and possibly signed at the end of last year, along with logical ways of withdrawing our troops in a responsible manner. <br>  The Iraqi's have wanted us to leave for a long time now.  <br>  The other allied countries that are there have agreements in place as well, or are departing Iraq as to their Govt guidelines.<br>  <br>  Here is an updated article dated February 27, 2009 posted only a few hours ago about the troop withdraw and leaving 35,000 to 50,000 until the end of 2011.<br>  <a href="http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/02/obama_announces_withdrawal_says_iraq_is_not_yet_secure.php" rel="nofollow">http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/02/...</a>|`|FVDhYH6Baa	Yes<br>  of course|`|TYGgRjqDaa	They certainly are not sharing everything.

DDbWKBKjaa	I'm not sure about the wording of your question, but as for your example...<br>  <br>  Intention to cause grievous bodily injury which results in death.  It would be a strange case, but I can't see why that wouldn't be murder.  The fact that the mechanism of death was somewhat inadvertent doesn't eliminate the causation nor the intention.<br>  <br>  If I shoot someone on a subway platform, in a way that doesn't immediately cause death though could be life-threatening, and the person falls in front of a train, that's simply academic.

DypTl9Zdaa	Naw, it wouldn't be that appealing to the people buying lottery tickets.  They could be spending the billions of dollars worth of proceeds from the lottery tickets on something like that.  I wonder where that money goes?  Right now Texas is trying to get it passed that we can have casinos but so far it is being met with a lot of opposition.  I don't understand why government thinks that they have to protect us from ourselves.  If someone is going to gamble they are going to do it whether it is in our state or not.  Billions of Texas dollars is being spent in Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Las Vegas.  We should bring the proceeds of that here and then we will have more money to spend on roads, schools, etc.  Sorry...just rambling.|`|M3maZgdyaa	People would stop playing. Some would play. It would never get to the amounts that it is today.<br>  <br>  Why not use the 25% tax on lottery for that purpose?<br>  <br>  $80 million x 25% =$20 million dollars.<br>  This is a nice size sum. This is every time someone wins.<br>  Sometimes the amount is more than this example. <br>  <br>  When you look at the amount of the lottery each week subtract 25% and that is tax.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lottery winners are great for our economy.

Trying to fix it would just be less money for schools and hospitals.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	well I think its not the lottery money is what need to be look at its the money that a goverment legal system rakes in from drug bust raids and all the free cash flow coming in that the courts manplate from pepole from fines should goto area of schools and hospitals and other areas not in the systems pocket thats a conflic of interest I say because they have a very nasty habbit of convicting pepole that  were no proof or if they was even gilty. so it they system can and do convict you they stand to make a few extra bucks free cash flow for the system. if they was made to use that money for things like schools etx then maybe the legal system would be fair like it was 50yrs ago. because there interest is not evolved around makeing a extra buck for there instatution. and yes that it what its about and they do it 1000 times a day in the us 24 hrs a day. its all about the MONEY. for instance someon last year damaged my house I filed a complaint he went to court and paid a fine for destruction of property. im the victom did I get a cent of that money he paid the court and im the one with damage. No not a cent. they stuck it all there pockets and I got nothing while they profit from my loss. I think if he pays a fine the money should go to the damage not there pockets and no I shouldent have to take anyone to small claims court he went to court himself and paid alreadt so I shouldent have to eat the exspense or lose.|`|goe3y4FPaa	no... life is not fair.. isnt it.. now imagine.. would u rather win $500 million half to taxes.. and keep 250 million or win 1 million and keep $500,000.. which would be gone.. when u buy a home??

I'd say just wait till you're 21, and then attempt to join as an officer.  Having a degree when you enlist does usually grant you a higher rank (usually, Specialist, E-4), and will give you more "promotion points" after a certain point to attempt to make Sergeant (E-5).<br>  <br>  Having prior enlisted service does often allow your troops to look up to you more when you do become an officer. If you do choose to enlist, and not wait till you're 21 to become commissioned -- make sure your unit knows your goals/intentions.  I've had friends who were given hell, and had to fight an upward battle when they sought to become officers.<br>  <br>  And the pay difference primarily comes from having a few years already in service.<br>  <br>  But, the overall pay difference between enlisted and officers...is quite large.

They are usually printed along with the bill in USCAAN.<br>  <br>  During the administration of President George W. Bush, there was a controversy over the President's extensive use of signing statements, which critics charged modified the meaning of the statutes. In July 2006, a task force of the American Bar Association stated that the use of signing statements to modify the meaning of duly enacted laws serves to "undermine the rule of law and our constitutional system of separation of powers".<br>  <br>  While it is in theory possible for other executives to issue signing statements, there is no record of notable signing statements by anyone other than an American president.!!

Maybe you'll get lucky and find something usable.  Second, here's a few thoughts off the top of my head:  set out the cost and payment schedule, if possible, make everyone pay upfront into an escrow account or put it some place with a neutral third party who will pay the bills; go over penalties for missing payments (add an attorneys fee clause in case you have to sue); you should also add a provision stating something about a "majority of owners (the four of you)" being able to make decisions binding on everyone; etc.<br>  <br>  Note: I ran a quick Google search on "shared driveway agreement" and came up with a ton of hits.  You should be able to find a lot of information there that will give you an idea of what you should be asking and talking to your neighbors about.

Ut2MoCNLaa	I think you need to study some history, both American, French and Indochinese (Cambodia, Laos, and the three area of current Vietnam, Tonkin, Annam and Cochin China).<br>  <br>  The US first sent US troops into Vietnam in 1944. They were members of the OSS (the for-runner of the CIA) and they trained and supplied the Viet Minh and its military wing, the Peoples Army of Vietnam (PAV) (Ho Chi Ming and the school teacher, Giap, to fight against the Japanese and the Vichy French.<br>  <br>  After WW-2 was finished Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnamese Independence on the steps of the French Governor-General's residence with members of the OSS standing next to him and a fly-past of US Army Air-force planes.<br>  <br>  Ho Chi Minh then sent letters to President Truman asking for recognition of their independence (something the FDR had promised), but Truman supported the French re-occupation of their colonies.<br>  <br>  Talks took place between the Viet Ming and the French but they collapsed in 1947. The First Indochina War  or the "War of Independence"  (1947-1954) started late that year.<br>  <br>  The US was supplying a number of materials to France under the "Marshall Plan" including arms and other munitions. The US started to send them directly to the french in Vietnam from 1948 onwards and also sent aircraft and Air force pilots from 1949 onwards, first to fly supply missions for the French then to fly actual combat missions.<br>  <br>  The French were defeated at a valley fort of Dien Bien Phu near the Lao-Vietnam border west of Hanoi in 1954.  A peace conference was held in Geneva and the "1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina" were signed.<br>  Part of the agreements stated --<br>  a)  That Vietnam would be divided into two TEMPORARY demilitarized zones at the 17th parallel with the 17th parallel NOT to be taken as a national or international border.<br>  b) The French were to go south and the Viet Minh were to go north of the 17th parallel and NO new military equipment was to be introduced into either zone, and advisersors were to be introduced.<br>  c)  Nationwide elections were to be held no later than June 1956 for the reunification of Vietnam with the capital in Hanoi.<br>  <br>  <br>  Historians give  several start dates  for the Second Indochina (Vietnam) War.  They are -- 1954 -- even before the First Indochina War was finished and the agreements signed;  1956 following the failure to hold nationwide elections; December 1959 when the conference was held just outside of Saigon where the National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam (NLF) was formed; 1960 when the NLF first clashed with soldiers and police of the Armed Forces of Vietnam (ARVN); February 1961, the date the US military uses as the start date -- when the "first US serviceman was killed in Vietnam". Actually seven others had been killed between 1957 and 1961. <br>  <br>  The Second Indochina (Vietnam) War started because the US violated the "1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina". Even before the agreements were signed the US sent CIA operatives into the northern zone to destroy infrastructure, dikes, dams, railway tracks and junctions, coal and oil depots etc. They also carried out a "disinformation campaign" saying that the Viet Minh would persecute catholics (85% of Vietnamese are Mahayana Buddhists while 15% are Catholic). Many Catholics fled into the southern zone.<br>  <br>  The US installed a Catholic seminary student and right-wing anti-communist, Ngo Dien Diem, first as Prime Minister then as President of the illegal (under international law and the 1954 Geneva agreements) "Republic of South Vietnam". Diem immediately stated persecuting all dissidents in the south including many Buddhists and former Viet Minh (former southerners who remained behind with their families).<br>  <br>  They then started sending arms, munitions and advisers, all in violation of the Geneva agreements.<br>  <br>  They also refused to allow nationwide elections in the south with U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dallas stating, "If we allow free elections throughout the country Ho Chi Minh will win over 80% of the votes".  There were protests in the south and Diem cracked down harshly on the dissidents arresting many, killing others or both.<br>  <br>  There was growing unrest and in December 1959 a conference was held outside of Saigon where the NLF was formed. The NLF is frequently called the Viet Cong, a misnomer as the term is shortened slang for "Vietnamese Communist", something that less than 4% of the NLF members were and even less understood the theories of Marx, Engels and Lenin.<br>  <br>  The first conflict between the NLF and the ARVN was in mid 1960 when the NLF attacked a police station and stole many US weapons and munitions. Prior to this the NLF were using weapons from WW-2 and the First Indochina War.<br>  <br>  The US increased the supply of weapons etc plus advisers from mid 1960 onwards.|`|AA11598520	It wasn't.|`|Bkl0515eaa	It wasn't wrong for the US to enter the Vietnam War.  It was a natural strategic response to the threat of communist expansion in a critical part of the world.  Even though we ultimately lost the Vietnam War, we bought time to develop other allies in the region, such as Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Australia.  We also kept the important South China Sea free from Soviet/Chinese interference, thus preserving the trade routes linking Japan/Korea/Taiwan/Australia to India, Africa, and Europe.<br>  <br>  But our main problem was misjudging the enemy's will to fight and achieve the independence of Vietnam.  The North Vietnamese knew from the beginning they would lose ten or twenty times as many men as us, but they also knew we would get tired of it first.  We could have won, but at a cost of over 100,000 US lives.  I don't think US public opinion would have supported this cost.  There were at least two options that would have allowed us to win the war at a lower cost in American lives.  We could have nuked North Vietnam, or used chemical or biological warfare.  But we usually follow international law.  From a military standpoint an invasion of North Vietnam was the most effective option.  But this might have caused ten million Chinese soldiers to come back at us, and that would have been a real mess!  Our political leaders just weren't prepared to risk an all-out war with China.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, our real mistake was not realizing our inability to win the war at an acceptable cost, and therefore not cutting our losses and getting out earlier.  We ended up wasting a lot of lives and money in that tragic conflict.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Because the ultimate logic for entering the war was based on unsupported speculation, that Communism would spread to neighbouring countries and this would somehow be disasterous for America (it happened anyway and it did not harm America), and also, the madness of sending young drafted Americans into jungle terrain, fighting an invisible enemy, with no clear military objectives, for years without end.<br>  <br>  Lessons were not learned.|`|CTaKjwDTaa	because Congress never declared War|`|fBwrBqtIaa	Because, they were drafting young americans to go fight in a war that we didn't need to be in
X4kSnB4gaa	You have to apply for the GI Bill. Ask your NCO or someone and they will know what to do. When I did it, I got all the papers from Admin at my unit, filled them out and turned them into the office at my university. The school processes it all and works with the VA to get you your GI Bill money. If I remember correctly, it's like 300 and some each month with full-time credits. Not that much, but every bit helps for a broke college student.|`|80f46f96ec87da284c65875f2a90422daa	I thought you got free school in Illinois and Texas if you were in the service.

Illinois is on of the best states for servicemembers who want schooling. If you are a vet you are sitting pretty. Head down to the school (public) and talk to the counselors. They will help
AA11858035	If someone were using my business computer on my time to view porn, yes, that someone would be fired. Not just for the porn issue, but the potential viruses those sites can carry can destroy your business records. <br>  <br>  And it really wouldn't be that hard to go into the computer in question and find out when and who was on the computer. It would have his log-on ID, and I'm betting you don't know that.|`|HeoS75kGaa	How do you 'browse' through the company computer and see what he was looking at?  It sounds like you were the one who created the hostile work environment by snooping on the manager and trying to get him in trouble.  The only sexual harassment is your claim about pornography which had nothing to do with you, to begin with.  It's your job that's closer to being on the line.|`|hmsMpECkaa	What you do is monitor his actions and note any flirtations or any unwanted advances toward anybody and once you see any, report that and that will lead to a closer examination of his work habits.  Study the policy of the use of the computers at work and the results of a first warning.  See, there is a way of erasing evidence of the computer site visited.  But, just tell him, he'd better be careful of what he does from now on .  <br>  This is the business world.|`|wqCznap2aa	Wow someone oughtta counter sue your *** for getting him in this mess. Of course it's not sexual harrassment. Sexual harassment is when he's telling you his sexual fantasies or inapropriately touching for you. Dam you are one awful employee.

It might not be the best thing they want to hear from their kid, but they will support you and they're gunna be proud of you once you graduate basic or boot camp [depending on which military branch you join] and accomplish your dream. and i'm sure they're proud of you now. Doesn't matter what your parents or other relatives want you to do, it's what you want to do. But don't join for the wrong reasons. it's not gunna be easy cause it wasn't easy for my brother, but hey. you never know until you try. my parents and i supported him since day one. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you finish high school though.

Think about taking the ROTC route. It opens up more opportunities for you personally as well.<br>  <br>  Second--here's the hard part: you have to have the courage to face your parents, tell them simply and honestly what you want and why. And--if you can't handle doing that, DON'T join the military. YOu either have the courage of your convictions and are willing to stand up for them--or you have no business wearing the uniform.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|Swmd0P2uaa	I commend you for considering the military!

Be serious about it though sit them down and tell them how you feel. have your recruiter talk to them too if you can. its a very noble thing to do and a lot of great opportunities can come from it, they will ven pay for your college if you decide to go later. you have to be strong in your convictions though. good luck.|`|MsemtDHOaa	Well, you have a lot of time to think about your decision and that helps.  I would explain it to them regardless of what their opinions are but, make your own decision.  I joined without my fathers consent and he was mad at first, but by the time I graduated boot camp he was proud.  Your parents will be too, they just worry for you.  I had the best time of my life in the Navy.  Good luck!|`|AbfP2xJuaa	you have to just tell them straight out, if you really want to join it then they cant exactly stop you, if they say no then they are just worried about you but remember you really have to be one hundred percent sure that you really want to join cause its a big desission, well good luck!

5ac2dCxJaa	The government gets what it pays for and it pays for public schools to pump out dumb citizens. The greatest threat to any form of government is a diligent well informed population. The media is part of the government and that's what most intellectually ignorant, lazy Americans want. Just like a person who eats McDonald's doesn't want to know what's in it, they would rather remain ignorant than bear the responsibility of knowledge.

f36531cfc5056db27dde00a32fcfe48baa	Corporal is an NCO were as a Specialist is not.  SPC-4 is a left-over rank form the Vietnam era when the had all the way up to SPC-9.  They were like the equivelent of Warrent Offivers to Commisioned Officers.  The Specialist ranks were technical with no leadership autority.  CPL's nowadays are usually team leaders.  "Training" that the LT is referring to is probably your 2 week period.  He is saying you will meet the qualifications to advance to E-4 then.  I was promoted to E-4 after 11 months as an E-3.  I was giving a time in service waiver and time in grade waiver.  As about any possible waivers to get promoted fasted.  Because of that i was able to make E-5 in under 2 years.<br>  <br>  The second link is the Army Reg. of promotions.  That should help alot.  Good luck.|`|XA69SIvnaa	Specialist is the highest level of lower enlisted without having the responsibilities of a NCO. Once you make this rank you should have proficient knowledge to do all skill level 1 and most skill level 2 taskings in your job. Corporal is just a rank the Army craps on specialists that can't goto the E-5 board yet. It is the lowest NCO rank and you can imagine what that entails. <br>  <br>  Your 1LT may be a bit confused, or maybe not. Do you have a college degree? How long you been in service? <br>  <br>  You can't become an E-4 in training insofar as while your at BCT/AIT (unless you enlist with a college degree) but the minimum active duty requirement is 18 months time in service (waiverable to E-4) 24 months time in service (no UCMJ, no flags, automatic promotion to E-4). So you need time in service, 18 to 24 months, no disciplinary or administrative action pending, or a college degree (to get this rank immediately) to make spec4.<br>  <br>  Corporal is just a rank thrown on some spec4s to give them responsibility in lieu of a sergeant. In my opinion the rank is useless in today's Army.|`|ZmejnqrYaa	The difference between a SPC and CPL in the Army is a SPC is not considered an NCO and a CPL is. A SPC and CPL are the same pay grade but are not the same rank. SPC are generally not in a leadership position and CPLs are. <br>  <br>  You can get promoted to E4 with a waiver with atleast 18 months Time in Service and 3 Months Time in Grade. Commanders that are assigned to training units do not have the authority to promote a Initial Entry Training Soldier (If that is what you are) to E4 as those Soldiers do not have nearly enough time in the military to get promoted to PFC, let alone SPC.|`|nFPjhGbDaa	A Corporal is an NCO (non-commissioned officer) a specialist is not; they both are E-4 meaning same pay. You get laterally transferred to Corporal from Specialist because of the need for the position (it is not very common). To get promoted to Specialist, it is automatic after 24 months in service (unless you get into big trouble) or you can get it in as little as 18 months with a waiver (if you are just that good), or get it coming in if you have a bachelors degree. Do not trust the military.com website, their info is wrong. They say that a SGT going for SSG must have a degree to compete; there are no degree requirements for any enlisted promotions.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	Coporals do a lot more work. Specialists slack.

Dostoevski said that taking a new step is what people fear most. Any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive, affirmative, non-challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people. THEY MUST FEEL SO FRUSTRATED, SO DEFEATED, SO LOST, SO FUTURELESS IN THE PREVAILING SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO LET GO OF THE PAST AND CHANGE THE FUTURE. This acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution. To bring on this reformation requires that the organizer work inside the system, among not only the middle class but the 40 per cent of American families - more than seventy million people - whose income range from $5,000 to $10,000 a year [in 1971]. They cannot be dismissed by labeling them blue collar or hard hat. They will not continue to be relatively passive and slightly challenging.

93M8Vccvaa	It sounds like he has found a street where the drivers have no respect for the law. Maybe if writes enough tickets the drivers will learn to obey the traffic laws. Hope he or she keeps up the good luck.|`|aymBTRlyaa	It's not OK, but sadly is legal.<br>  <br>  To all the people saying that's his job: It's a strippers/ho's job to get naked, lay down with people and spread nasty sh*t... Is that ok because 'it's her job" too?<br>  <br>  Just cuz it's someone's job, doesn't mean they aint effin people's life's up by giving all these tickets and cr@p<br>  <br>  ...Yeah I know... thumbs down coming.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	Sure it's legal. If violations are being committed, they need to be writing citations. <br>  <br>  I'd be happy as hell if traffic officers would work traffic in front of my house.<br>  <br>  What are you whining about.....|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Yes, it is OK for an officer to do that.<br>  <br>  This type of action usually takes place after there are numerous complaints about speeders in a certain area.  The department will send an officer in response to these complaints.  The officer will sit in plain sight and ticket offenders for several days.  Word gets around that the police are working that area and people start slowing down as they go through there.  <br>  <br>  The speeders are in control of how long the officer stays on that post!  Which is worse for you ... having the speeders race through your area or having the officer sit out there?|`|86b28287757c82684fcf1bf59441d9aeaa	There used to be this cop car that used to be stationed inside my Aunts housing complex (like in the bushes) and he would get people for speeding all the time.  Some people even knew he was there looking for something and they still got caught.  lol I don't think it's power abuse as long as they're pulling people over for a valid reason. Like going over the speed limit or whatever.|`|9120dc418a017a1bdb6aae2ce3dfc8caaa	it seems to me that a lot of speeders go down your street!|`|3d15696918d983a2f171673f4d9bc244aa	If the cop has a specific reason to be there then yes he can.  From the information you have given where he as pulled over eleven people in a one hour period, it would seem that he has a specific reason to be there.  If you feel that he is there for some other purpose then call the police department and complain.  It would however appear that for what ever reason there are a lot of people that are speeding through your area, and he's doing his job to stop them.  Imagine if you had kids and one of them got hit by a speeding car...you may not feel as bad that he was there trying to get people to slow down.|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	If you were fishing in a boat on a lake, and you stayed in one spot and you were catching plenty of fish all day, would you move the boat and go fish somewhere else?

Pulling people over for speeding and siting them for it.  It is all perspective though, because if you had lost a dear friend or family member to a speeding vehicle you would be bringing him coffee and donuts.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	It's his job, not abuse of power.  Someone on your street probably called and complained about violations and there's probably an officer assigned to do just what that officer is doing.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Oh, like someone in the neighborhood, has not complained about speeding cars, doing 40 mph in a 25 mph residential zone?<br>  See they are not always at Donut & Coffee shops.|`|09e7abe08ce00bd3e0c4d7e7472c103daa	Abuse of power?

A Reagan democrat is someone who traditionally voted democrat, who defected from the party to vote for Reagan.  And the number one reason they did this was an abandonment of christian values by the democrats who embraced marxism.  The democratic party changed, so they voted republican.  Many of those folks became republicans.<br>  <br>  Reagan himself was a Reagan democrat.  He originally was a politician in the democratic party.  He become so disgusted with how vile the democratic party became that he switched parties.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	The "Moral Majority" repulsed a lot of them...

And both companies buildings were close to each other much like the twin towers. Both companies had close political ties to the government. Bush was close friends with the Ceo of Enron.  And Chenney use to work for Haliburton (and stock options). Enron was one of the biggest contributors to the Republican party.

Now that a Democrat is using it, overusing it, and badly at that, its "whats the difference"?<br>  <br>  Shoe is on the other foot now.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Every president has used notes. Bush used index cards all the time. Obama just happens to like a teleprompter so he doesn't have to fumble with cards and can gesture with his hands.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the guy who said that Reagan could answer questions without cue cards: He hardly ever answered questions. He had fewer press conferences than any other president in modern history. He never answered questions shouted by reporters while walking (an ongoing joke was that he always gestured that he couldn't hear).  When he did depart from prepared scripts, his handlers scambled to get him off the microphone because they were afraid of what he would say.|`|EwdsfwUyaa	Barry uses one at every event large and small<br>  <br>  One Term Barry is the only president ever to do that.<br>  <br>  "Obama’s reliance on the teleprompter is unusual — not only because he is famous for his oratory, but because no other president has used one so consistently and at so many events, large and small."|`|rxQt7auLaa	The difference was that Reagan could answer a question without using the teleprompter, or relying on tired old campaign rhetoric.<br>  <br>  If you ever saw the way Obama fumbled about without his speech right in front of him you would realize what we are talking about.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Reagan was an actor for about 25 or more years.

Even Forbes, who supported Obama has lost billions and is disgusted with the obama administration.  It is apparent Obama does not know what hes doing and is involving himself with health care, the environment and everything else so he does not have to deal with the puplic outrage at what he is doing to the economy. It is his diversionary tactic but the public is not fooled by it. His diversion today was embryonic stem cell research.  The main stream media seems to have missed his statement where he said " the time has passed when morals take priority over science". That statement sums up his complete lack of respect for life.|`|mq7gcKGaaa	He's never been worried about the financial market.

And now America has to face Islamic fundamentalism, so many Americans are trying to firmly uphold their "Christians values" to stand up against the terrorists. Republicans, being the socially conservative party, have gone along with the religious to have a firm grasp of the American populace. This is why they are against secularism.

Marxists don't like private enterprise.  So his words are hollow and now the American people are disallusioned and will not listen to the administration...The puppet masters are having trouble controlling the puppet.  The puppet cannot answer a question off the cuff, so they have to keep him secluded in the White House till further notice...He is an empty vessel, void of a moral compass, and if you don't give him a teleprompter, he is floundering and totally lost. We is way out of his league; he is ill equipped to be President.. This President is being hostile toward the stock market; toward our institutions; toward the rich of this country who keep it going; so how can we come out of this?  We are downsliding to an abyss; where we will not know this country in a year.  Ever see the movie Mad Max?  Well, think of that movie, and you will know what we will be dealing with.  He has to get rid of Holder, Geithner; and Rham Emanuelle, to restore his credibility with the American people..Yes, there will always be the walking idiots who will follow him anywhere; anyhow but they are becoming a minority; he is losing the people that were Republicans; the undecideds that voted for him..and his numbers are dropping like a lead weight...|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	Maybe it's reacting to the right-wing noise machine yelling "Obama's a failure!"

Obama has been pretty clear that he is going to regulate the markets and wall street a bit more than his predecessors of the past 20 years. The investors are scared that this will cause less profits from the companies, and that the stock prices will follow suit. This makes the investors sell the stock, causing the price to fall, just as they predicted. <br>  <br>  Its a self-fulfilling prophesy. <br>  <br>  My hope is that investors will see the low prices as potential to invest at a realitively cheap price, causing the stock to rise. We will see if this happens though. The market can be unpredictable at times, and I don't want to speak on behalf of it when we are still in the middle of this mess.
AA11401709	I have not heard of such a test but I'm still in the process of joining so I have not gotten this far yet. However, if such a test exists, then I would expect it to be similar to (agree, don't agree, strongly agree...etc) they give common sense questions to make sure you can make the right decision on a given time and to see your ideas about different things. I applied for a job as a PMC (Private Military Contractor) and the questions were like (Do you love the U.S. army?, If an X thing happen, what will you do?) and similar things. Also there were simple statements and you were supposed to rate yourself as (agree, don't agree, somehow agree, etc) such as: (I will always pay attention to my interpretations, I will support my fellow co-workers, I can function under pressure, etc)<br>  <br>  I hope this would help good luck

Believe me I would love it if everyone could be happy but we don't live in a perfect world so we have to pick and choose. I personally believe if you wish to pray in school more power to you. I also believe the youth of this country would be more more inclined to respect and not take for granted all the freedoms we have if they would stress the pledge and understanding of the rest of the world in school. I am in 12th grade right now and I see the lack of understanding and respect everyday. In the morning I am the only one who stands for the pledge.|`|KDxTxhXHaa	Our schools still say the Pledge.  Also if you want, you may pray, it's just that teachers or schools are not allowed to force you to pray in their religious manner.  I like that my children are not forced to pray in that manner.   We believe in God, but we don't agree with all religions.  I don't know, if you were a Methodist, would you want your child to have to say a Catholic prayer?|`|MWJOEikkaa	America has lost it's values,responsibility,and work ethics.Now we reward bad behavior.

At Head of State dinners, the President of the United States would have to sit next to the visiting dignitary and actually discuss in front of others various issues and make small talk.  Obama has absolutely no experience at that and the teleprompter can't be set up so that he can read a speech he didn't write.  Unless one of his advisers is sitting next to him and telling him what to say, he's lost for conversation.  As for the Democrats and lobbyists he invites to his Wednesday night parties, he can bs them all day because they don't care what he says.  They know anything he says today will change by tomorrow.

AA10231921	please don't.|`|tSTtOwqAaa	hey two cents: it's Barack <br>  <br>  and the name thing will be very goofy but will probably happen|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	First of all, Obama spells his first name Barak, not Barrack|`|Ro4rrQKDaa	Gross<br>  Yes I a bet they will Yuch Puke Gross.|`|rdSuD3qVaa	Parents name their children cultural names that are foreign to us all the time. People immigrate to this country with unusual names. So what if people named Barack or Hussein are walking around. Throw in a Phineas, Apple, Kal-El, Bronx, Kyd, Sage Moonblood, Moxie Crimefighter, or Memphis Eve for a few other strange ones. I just hope they aspire to do great things. Get use to it and move on.
AA10709853	never heard of this either...<br>  <br>  okay I looked it up.  VBSS or Boarding Parties.  any rating can volunteer and yes there are Chiefs and Officers.   authority typically rests with the COAST GUARD det on board.  <br>  <br>   most COs expect you to get qual'd on your workspace first.  others will make you also get your ESWS pin before you can volunteer.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Can you spell it out? I was Navy for 14 years and don't know what you are asking about. Please explain MIO/MIF.
zk1FSXcIaa	My advice is to let your insurance handle it.  Remember, if she even chooses to sue, she's suing your insurance company, not you personally.  And that is if she can even get an attorney to take her case.  Most accident attorneys only get paid when their client receives money, so they usually won't take a case with no merit, though some will surprise you.  They will call you for a statement, at which time you can tell them about the slow speed of the accident.  Judging by the damage to her car and yours, and a doctor's evaluation, the insurance adjusters will determine what, if any, monetary compensation she deserves for injuries she claims to have.  This is why you pay for automobile insurance every month.  Thank goodness you weren't one of those idiots who drive around without insurance, or you would be personally liable for her bills.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	just make sure the insurance company has all this information. they will take care of this. there really isn't much you can do especially if the officer deemed it to be your fault. the insurance company will determine whether it is worth fighting.|`|zDJ26bktaa	Lawyer, private investigator to photograph her doing something physical|`|L2bQifUXaa	Your insurance company will require that she have a physical examination... if that doesn't turn up any serious injuries, you should be good. If it does, even if the injury didn't result from that incident, you will probably be out of luck as there is no way to prove otherwise.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	She can definitely win, although it will be up to your insurance company to fight it.<br>  <br>  Just for the record, you have no way of knowing if she is injured.  Soft tissue injuries such as backs or necks often take a day or two to appear.  The fact that she has had back problems in the past makes it even MORE likely she has an actual injury, whether her claim of liability is allowed or not.|`|9XJLlPaEaa	Tell your insurance company all the information. Leave it to them to do everything.
PSc1BEZTaa	Major Garrett just came on Fox News and said the same thing, .....<br>  I do not know how they can stand there and hush things over and just change around what they said a few month ago, with out any real explanation!<br>  <br>  I guess, selling us for stupid, ......|`|q4EXFhV7aa	I heard Warren Buffet say it may take 5 years, but haven't heard Obama say it 'will' take 5 years. Regardless, it will take time before we are over the worst of it.....he isn't a miracle worker and he isn't able to fix a severe recession in less than a year.|`|7qxqkjNhaa	It is amazing that Economist (the real experts) say that if the government did nothing we would already have began to get out of this mess. Business models would have changed, right now we are throwing good money after bad. History back this up.<br>  <br>  Can anyone show me something the government does better than the private sector can, No.|`|AA11654482	Politicians have been fooling people for years and years and years. You're realizing it now? :)<br>  <br>  The trouble is that we only get to vote for the candidate that we dislike the least.<br>  <br>  P.S: At least maybe Obama is honest. While campaigning, he wouldn't have had the correct financial estimates. Now when he does, it goes like "oops..."|`|jR8mclWIaa	I never heard him say the worst would be over by summer.  Source?

The letter said more than just that.  The letter must have said EXACTLY why his petition was denied.  It's required to give the exact reason.  Until you post the reason nobody here can give you any good answer.<br>  <br>  I can tell you this much.  The only hope he has is to retain an immigration attorney to appeal the decision.  Always use an attorney who is a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ailalawyer.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ailalawyer.org</a>|`|CbeNLpb3aa	How about - job hunting in his original country.

esgR6ayzaa	His grandmother said the president-elect was born in Hawaii when the interviewer ask her "Was he born in Mombassa?'<br>  <br>  This question was opted out by the coward Phillip Berg.<br>  <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2206033/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2206033/</a>|`|q4EXFhV7aa	lol. His grandmother NEVER said any such thing. It's so funny to me that you continue this crap. You KNOW you are about to drown in the waters of 'conspiracy theory' when even Sean Hannity stops touting your claims.|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	He never will. He is not a Natural Born Citizen. He's a Socialist trying to over-throw the USA. He and his fake Liberals, have already illegally stolen a Privately run Sector of Government called the Census Bureau. That is breaking the Constitution, and revoking our Right to Privacy, so right now, no American has privacy. Big Brother is warching. <br>  Notice how the Liberal Controlled Federal Government did nothing to stop Obama from breaking the law?<br>  <br>  Notice how the Military did NOTHING to defend the Constitution? Their main objective in their SWORN oath?<br>  <br>  Something is going down in Washington DC. Like a Government Take over? You think?<br>  <br>  What rights granted us by our forefathers will Obama take "from right under our noses"? The words in quotes is a phrase used throughout the world to define How does Socialists take over governments.<br>  <br>  We all need to keep a eye on this man. He can do anything he wants right now, the Lib controlled Congress agrees with everything he does, and the Republicans are so overly outnumbered, they can't stop him. <br>  The Liberals voted the GOP completely out of power. The Conservative citizens have no Governmental Represention, except in a few states, which has no reflection on Federal Gov. <br>  <br>  The Bill of Rights, The Constitution, and The Declaration of Independence, are in trouble. Obama doesn't care about them, or about his non-right to be a President.|`|NqNbIp2caa	You know the answer to this. HE DOESN"T HAVE IT!. It is on file in a vault. He applied for and was given a COLB that under our law is considered adequate pproof of birth details (it even says this on the COLB) and it was verified by the Hawaii administration.<br>  These pathetic claims of any doubt are merely a distraction that ain't working (and his grandmother did not say that - when conservatives stop editing the tape you see that it was a translation error and she confirms that he was born in the USA - when your only evidence is a lie and the evidence against you overwhelming it is time to give it a rest - you are just making yourself look silly).|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Please explain what the difference between a birth certificate and a certificate of live birth is.<br>  <br>  Because there IS NO DIFFERENCE.<br>  <br>  What you want has been done. Long ago. Are you going to keep this up for the next 8 years?|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Go tell short armed McCain that he needs to show his, also.  His Mother passed him  through the birth Canal  in Panama.   No wonder his arms are short.   Not much room in the Canal.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Nothing that he has the power to do is going to satisfy you.  Get over it.|`|EObwbJgUaa	I agree. If it was a republican doing this it would be an enormous controversy, but since it's a democrat he can get away with just about everything. Him even being in office violates the very wording of the constitution.<br>  To bash: Actually his grandmother, when asked, said that he was born in keyna. Look up your facts or get off mommys comouter.|`|fDuCamMraa	Not much question about it anymore. But, if he showed his real birth records he would just prove he's the fraud some already suspect, and some know.<br>  <br>  If it ever actually were to become litigated, I'm sure 0bama-bin-lyin would take the 5th.|`|gdYN39gtaa	He would if it would prove his citizenship. (It won't).<br>  <br>  To Bash:  Yes, Obama's grandmother did say that. It<br>   has nothing to do with Hannity.<br>  <br>  To MonaLisa: The question is mute with McCain as<br>  he's not president so, who cares?|`|fab424dc17e0236294c9f82e5e7f1241aa	The only possible reason for not releasing it, is that it does not exist.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	This question makes me wonder???<br>  <br>  Has John McCain's birth certificate been release? When and Where?<br>  Thank you.|`|EwdsfwUyaa	It is a long way to Kenya.|`|AA12045802	The Courts don't agree.|`|q7v1XAHAaa	He doesn't release it because he realized that he was not born in the US and would have to step down.  Why else would he not release it?|`|Kb8QRBp6aa	i love obama! he was bornin amerrreeeka|`|mGGHIBS2aa	GET OVER IT ALREADY!!!!|`|33ThRhRhaa	Because the one he has is from Kenya just like his paternal grandmother, Sarah testified in a sworn affidavit, and as confirmed by the on-air admission (WRIF radio broadcast) from Kenyan Ambassador, Peter Oyego that Obama's birthplace in Kenya has now become a public spectacle. There is/was also a national holiday in Kenya in celebration of Barack Hussein Obama, Jr.'s ascension to the highest office in the United States of America. The COLB he and his staff posted on that "Fight The Smears" campaign website and on DailyKos were both shown to be forgeries. Expert digital analysts also testified that they proved there were multiple errors in marking, patterns, and text as well as a lacking state seal from Hawaii that should immediately raise a red flag as to the authenticity of Obama's so-called Certification of Live Birth just from a cursory examination. He is not a natural born citizen, he flew to Pakistan in the 80's on non-U.S. based citizenship. His mother was also too young at the time of his birth to legally confer citizenship to her son according to the provisional guidelines of our citizenship laws. His step father, Lolo Soetoro enrolled him at the Fransiskus Catholic School in Indonesia when his mother (Stanley Ann Dunham) remarried. His records from that school under his adoptive father list him as an Islamic follower and a citizen of Indonesia! This guy is not legitimate, he is a FRAUD 100% and he needs to be fully investigated and kicked out of the United States of America, God-willing. This is a heinous crime which has defrauded the entire American public and the whole international community. Our Constitutional Republic is under attack from within.
S6XSLvjLaa	I dont know why they didnt just do that like they promised us when GWB won the election.  There are plenty of socialist countries to choose from.  They should have picked one of those and left the rest of us alone.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	None of the above. They'll go to another capitalist nation (Australia, or Russia by that time?) because things are better there. And they'll $#^& it all up.<br>  <br>  Perhaps we can ship them there preemptively, like in the third book in the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy?|`|525m5qrTaa	It is your question, not my answer...

If you think lefties like China & North Korea you're crazy. It's the Reps that like China not the Dems. Reps want to trade with them reguardless of what their society is like & want to give away american jobs to people overseas. It's Far Righties that want the Death Penalty & televised executions just like China. And it's Far Righies that want places like Guantanamo Bay just like China. I don't agree with Lefties on everything but to suggest that they would want to go to those countries is rediculous! There's enough things that they hate about those countries that would make them wanting to live there look as stupid as your picture of Obama.|`|Gbwiwkauaa	Who destroyed the economy?

L7wJwbjDaa	They will absolutely not accept responsibility.  As a Democrat Representative from Missouri said: this is about the political lynching of Franklin Raines.

150FyTAuaa	Because they (the democratic left) put the earmarks there,,,, but it is only 1% of 800 billion $,,,,,,,a lot of $ to sniff pigs.<br>  He has spent more than Bush and Bush had 2 wars, 9/11, Katrina and in office 8 years.|`|AA11828439	What he actually said was that he would fight for earmark reform. It is not within the powers of the President to make such a declaration. His only alternative would be to veto the bill. Please note, a large percentage of those earmarks are from Republicans. And this bill is a leftover from last year. HIS budget has NO earmarks. Perhaps some REAL research into the facts would assist you in not looking ridiculous by posting falsehoods and half truths.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	I don't know...we complained when your boss was in charge, and look where it got us, into the mess that we have now.|`|m24wuDzwaa	The omnibus spending bill is a budget left over from last year. It is to fund the federal government for the rest of 2009 which should have been done last year. It was created by the previous congress. It is not President Obama's bill., but you are right to suggest that he should veto it. It may not matter anyway because right now it doesn't look like it will pass the Senate.|`|K71Qoakwaa	I don't expect him to be with me 100% of the time.  Since Bush was 0%, I'll take what I can get.<br>  <br>  The earmars amount to less than 1% of the cost of the recent stimulus bill.|`|AU70o6wTaa	he's their king and can do bo wrong.

My company is moving to home based employees in order to save money for a physical building and this is costing me more as I have to provide DSL and dedicated phone line in order to work; but, it sure beats the alternative of no job.  I'm in my 60's and am a few years away from retirement so it will be even more difficult for me if my job goes under and concern about the future does place more stress on me.  <br>  <br>  All indications are that the economy will worsen before it begins to recover, but I choose to remain optimistic.  Constantly focusing on doom and gloom can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br>  <br>  South Alabama, USA|`|btEuBcmAaa	I'm from North Carolina (which is in the United States). It's not really effected my family because I guess you could say we do have money. We spend more money now then we ever have. My mom, however, did get laid off. Now, she can't find another job. It is effecting my friends & their families. A lot of people are now scrambling to even find minimum wage jobs. Teens can't get jobs anywhere. I think when it gets much worse, then it will start effecting us.|`|tslAZRwQaa	i think it's great, i've never had a credit card or bank loan. I've always saved up or gone without.

So far , so good!!|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You mean affected, the verb.<br>  <br>  I live in Los Angeles and most of my friends have lost their jobs and are temping if they're lucky.  My friend the investment banker has slept on three different couches for the last two months and still doesn't have his own place.<br>  <br>  Of course it will get worse, much much worse.<br>  <br>  I let go of my car two years ago because I couldn't afford gas.

In other words, no effect whatsoever from the 'recession'... (I also anticipate similar results from the 'recovery'.)

ZY95NCzJaa	No.  A porn star is not going to win a Senate seat.<br>  <br>  I didn't say that paying for sex was any better or even that being a porn star makes you a bad person.  The facts are though that a percentage of voters in that area have paid for sex at one time or another while there are not too many porn stars.  Paying for sex is not uncommon, especially in politics.  Being a porn star casts a certain negative image of a person that, right or wrong, is what society on a whole thinks.|`|GdO2iaabaa	I don't know... pornography is far more pleasurable than politics.

Also, there are negative health effects that comes with alcohol use.

This letter was from 1871. He also wrote the book "morals and Dogma", considered to be "The Bible" of freemasonry. In it, Pike explains that the true Lightbearer worthy of praise was Lucifer. Look it up for yourself if you don't believe it.<br>      Interestingly enough, plans for World War 3 were also laid out, and that's the war we are being prepped for in our current generation. This one will be designed to pit the muslims against the Christians, to mutually wipe each other out. The plan is for this next World War to be the final war, the one that will fulfill their goal of installing AntiChrist on the throne of the world. Do a Google search on this and you'll see the letter, again, written from Pike to Mazzini. Look at that letter and consider it's warnings, then look at current events through that lens, and you will learn that not only have you been lied to throughout the past 100+ years, they are currently manupulating current events, such as this deep recession we are currently in,  in order to achieve their goals of "ordo ab chao", or "Order out of Chaos".

The Marines are very physically challenging and you are putting yourself and others in danger if you enlist with a medical condition. Also, a lot can change in 4 years.

Enlisted do not "work their way up" to a commission.  When a person enlists they will earn their way up to Non-Commissioned Officer when they make E-4.  Some enlisted may become warrant officers (still below commissioned officers) at E-6 or higher if they choose that career path.  <br>  <br>  If an enlisted person wants to become a commissioned officer he has to do ROTC, OCS, or go to a military academy just like any person with no prior service.<br>  <br>  Every commissioned officers rank has more respect than every non-commissioned officer.  Every person who is a major F-Up gets made fun of behind their back regardless of rank.  But no NCO would talk stuff to a commissioned officer to his/her face because the rank of commissioned officers demands respect.|`|Qn3CxUeMaa	The whole idea of someone wanting to be an officer but going enlisted first to "gain respect" is a tool recruiters use to get you into their program.  They don't get credit if you decide to become an officer becuase you have to work thorugh the Officer Selection Officer.  The previous answers said it best, respect is dependent on the individual not the time they've spent.  Also as an enlisted man you don't have many "leadership" responsiblities for the first few years, until around the time you become a Corporal you aren't leading anyone.  That usually takes a few years, so the other idea to enlist to gain leadership is another tool propigated by recruiters to get you to enlist.  It sounds like it makes sense when you are a civilian and don't know how it works in the military, but once you inside its totally different.

It is impossible to teach, mentor, and develop Soldiers without counseling them.  An initial counseling is required within 30 days, maximum of your arrival/assignment.  The purpose of a initial counseling is to inform you of his/her expectations and to inform you of the standards and regulations concerning PT, Military Customs/Courtesies, College, Correspondence courses, military schools, Policies, Promotions, Uniform wear and appearance, just to name a few.  <br>  <br>  However, if you were disrespectful (which is a broad statement) and disobeyed him, you (should) be punished as the UCMJ directs. Disrespect could come in the form of rolling your eyes, sighing, not standing at parade rest, etc, etc. It is also your duty to obey the "Orders of the President of the United States and the Officers appointed over you", Remember?|`|KSizZYZEaa	He/She is the NCO and you appear not to be. If what he/she as the NCO is asking you to do is out of reason then yes you should report it. Such as if the NCO tells you to steal this for me or you will go to an article 15. As I am guessing that the punishment is corrective but not unreasonable in nature then you should do it. The military will side with the NCO over you and nothing you say above is unreasonable as the NCO goes. If he/she as the NCO thinks you need some counseling then go do it. If the NCO is wrong then carry on and soon you will move on to new leadership but no reason to make an enemy out of the current chain of command unless you really want to piss everyone off. I think you should tread lightly and do what you need to do to make it out of Afghanistan and back to the real world without flushing you military time away! Good Luck!

AA10118655	Decriminalizing is not the same as legalizing. Legalizing it would probably amount to licensed dealers and growers, and tax dollars generated. Decriminalizing it means it is still illegal, but the penalties are very light, or they do not prosecute for it (usually just a small amount).<br>  <br>  Also, it doesn't matter what the state does. It is still illegal under federal law.

No matter what California does,  it will still be illegal.|`|CowgOqXTaa	The current law in CA is that possession of less than an ounce is already decriminalized. It is an infraction subject to a ticket and a $100 fine. It is not an arrestable offense. <br>  <br>  It is unlikely that any further decriminalization will occur.

9NcOBG8Laa	Well one day in humanity, one guy was ticked off at another guy and killed him. Then the dead guy's friend came and killed that guy, and that guys friend avenged him. This went on for some time until someone said, <br>  "Hey, how about I use this rock to aid in kill him?" and he made the first weapon. <br>  Then someone said, "How about I use this stick to counter that rock?" and he made a club. <br>  Then someone said, "How about I sharpen the end of this stick?" and he made a spear. <br>  Then someone said, "How about I sharpen the entirety of this stick?" and thus was the first wooden sword.<br>  <br>  As society progressed like this, they soon learned how to make their swords out of metal instead of wood, but as politics got involved suddenly concealable assassin-based weapons grew more tactical. So they cut down their metal swords and created knives and we've been stabbing each other in the back every since.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Seriously? Whenever the first human being figured out how to fashion a blade from a stone, the first knife killing probably followed shortly thereafter.

Knives are probably one of the oldest weapons.<br>  <br>  For a while there were multiple competing varieties of hominid. The evidence suggests they did not get along well. Superior tool users were better equipped to face a rapidly shifting climate and other tool users. The Sahara turned to desert but we survived.

lHDff8Braa	There was never any plan in place to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq after we invaded.  Candidate Bush himself stated that he did not believe in "Nation building", and he proved that by his ineffectiveness in rebuilding the nation he was responsible for destroying. His political connections made hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars, for NOT providing the Iraqi people with the basic necessities they needed.  Contractors were given no-bid contracts in order to pad their pockets, not help out, and they took advantage of the non-oversight to make themselves richer.<br>  That being said, there are some government agencies there that are really TRYING to help, like the Army Corps of Engineers, but their hands are tied by the rules in place.  Bush used the Iraq war to reward his friends with money from the US treasury, not to help the Iraqi people.<br>  Just remember, the American people do not support what Bush has done, and we DO support the Iraqi people who want to make their lives better.

So you made some money to pay your parents for letting you live in their basement. Then you take some more money & buy a game. Now you have given other people money they will give to other people. So you go back outside to sell lemonaide & muffins & this time I spend $2 cause I want to try a pistachio muffin. I love it so I tell all my friends. You end up having so much growth in you business thanks to all the things you buy that you end up having a little fast food place. You keep saving money & move out of Mom & Dad's basement & above your restaurant. So that is what a earmark should do even if you don't understand who it does that it does....if a painting in a museum brings in people from around the world who go home & tell their friends & they spend a fortune on hotels, etc. We are actually now bring in money that was not in our economy.

My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W.

AA10830892	Atheism is always at war.  Just look at the society around you.  Atheists, who claim to believe that God does not exist, sure seem to be spending a lot of time fighting against that very same God!  <br>  <br>  Atheism's war on religion is omnipresent today.  If you think that atheists are just benign pacifists, I don't know what world you are living it -- but it is not mine.<br>  <br>  The irony is that atheism claims to believe in no god, and yet it has erected for itself its own god.  The god of atheism is the cruelest and most vicious one that exists, because it is the most anti-human.  Ever human being has a natural desire for God, deep down.  To quench that desire, as atheism seeks to do, is to go against man.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you in your quest for Truth.|`|giiUaAPpaa	atheism- there is nothing to fight for!  except the right to burn in hell!|`|PPKuHl9baa	Hmmmm.....maybe you should read a bible or something., ., sinner.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	a point of fascism was opposition to organized religion|`|11dGXLchaa	LOL.

Some people don't think the change in our government is horrible. You may be amazed at how many people love him. Many people are good in making people think they are right if they didn't  like Obama. A lot of people will have hatred and  they really have to get over it. He receives hatred because a lot of many cities voted for McCain. Put yourself in McCain lovers shoes.

She's just like all the other trolls around here, except that some people actually whip out their wallets and spend money to read it.|`|shtP63traa	Meghan McCain is entitled to an opinion of Ann Coulter just as you're entitled to your opinion of Meghan McCain.|`|AA10079277	No, republicans believe in free speech.  You should consider it, it is a wonderful thing.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	The McCains are RINOs.  They messed up our party long enough.  I wish they would quit calling themselves republicans.|`|rdSuD3qVaa	That sounds about right.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	No, anyone who dislikes Coulter should say so. On the conservative side.....if you don't agree with someone--you don't keep pretending you do. I know that's hard to understand in a liberal's world..but it really isn't that complicated.<br>  <br>  As for Ann Coulter, she has some excellent points..however, her delivery ruins anything with merit. I watch her occasionally when she is on someone else's program...and I find that she is just very narcissistic. Because of this, her points get lost in her attitude.|`|AA11963685	I don't know much about McCain's daughter.  But if she has the good sense to call this woman exactly what she is then she's showing proof of intelligence.  If it quacks like duck and walks like a duck chances are it's a fricking duck.  She used exactly the right adjectives in describing the harpy Coulter.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	You just gave the reason why she's popular: "I find her offensive, radical, insulting, and confusing all at the same time."<br>  <br>  Just like Howard Stern, Rush, Hannity, just name one.  These people are liked by some and hated by others. Funny how both audiences keep tuning in to hear what they'll say next.|`|cbDfpfYKaa	We have free speech in this country as much as GW tried to deny us that.  Meghan is actually right on in her assessment of Coulter.  I am actually quite sure Coulter doesn't even believe the stuff she spouts.  She's trying to sell books.  She was and may still be dating a Democrat.|`|kJM65nXJaa	What, she is not allowed to form her own opinion.? She has the right to say whatever she chooses. I happen to think she is dead on in her description.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	She is completely correct. That woman, and her cult, are not people I respect.|`|Izw8c3uNaa	Mcain's daughter maybe cant get LAID<br>  <br>  but at least she does not say<br>  STUPID CRAPPP like coulter|`|8RflQ9DVaa	No. She's right on the money.|`|mWbO4xz1aa	Meghan is comfortable with vanilla Republicans who stay in their place as background noise for the government/media /education/wall street liberal establishment. Her father's 2008 campaign was an excellent example of this. For her to question an intelligent, fearless woman like Coulter is offensive, insulting and confusing.|`|jVUEohsNaa	I agree with Ann Coulter most of the time... Liberals hate tough talk, we are all supposed to bend over and be nice about everything to them.<br>  <br>  The only thing McAmnesty's daughter has going for her are some big boobs.<br>  <br>  She has a turnip for a brain, however.|`|KcAehrrKaa	I personally think some of the things Coulter says are, but I also think she may be one of the more tolerant ones. I've seen her talk with people that don't necessarily agree with her, and she could take the heat from what I've seen.|`|mQsF5dLnaa	Ann Coulter is offensive, radical, insulting, and confusing all at the same time. But then again so am I, thats why I love her. Meghan Mc Cain has a right to her opinion.|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	Anybody who reads huffingtonpost has nothing to do with staunch diehard republicans.<br>  Leave that out next time to avoid embarrassment.|`|k0jcYvX0aa	Meghan McCain is right to speak her mind.  She also shows some class.  Ann Coulter is indeed offensive and insulting.|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	Coulter is one of the few intellectual voices that you really hear speaking the truth anymore. So yea I don't agree with McCain.|`|giiUaAPpaa	mccains daughter is a liberal lover so shut up.  she only voted republican because of her dad.  She voted for Kerry in 2004!|`|cJYsEzO8aa	McCain's daughter should apologize to Rush Limbaugh.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Meghan McCain is absolutely correct.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	She is entitled to an opinion just like anyone else. I support free speech regardless of whether I agree with what is being said or not.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br>  That is what makes this country great!|`|nkr0Nvemaa	"the great ann coulter"' wow you must love hitler then.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Coulter is a joke...a female Limbaugh.|`|TBvUomw7aa	I personally feel that Ann Coulter is the C word.  She claims to be the most conservative and claims that everyone else is a liberal.  She is the epitome of a Neocon and collects a check from GOP payroll because she will draw plenty of attention.  I am sure that we could gather bigger dirt from guys who have dated her.  I'm sure that she is a psychopath!<br>  <br>  McCain's daughter can say what she wants about her.  It's a free country!   Well, kind of but we do have the first amendment right to say what we want.  However, it will just help her books sell.  Just like Rush, Bill Maher and other political "analysts" that feed you crappy propaganda, ignore them and they don't exist in your world.

What about the frozen ones that will get tossed out.<br>  I say use them|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I believe in stem cell research, but I prefer we not use embryoes.  We have other ways of obtaining stem cells...<br>  <br>  Non-embryonic stem cell research has actually lead to cures and treatments, whereas life-destroying embryonic research has not yet.|`|eQ2kITWqaa	I am not concerned about crack whores or dead babies do what you want with them.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	i agree with pfo
CM3Fl3WRaa	It may be a scam that works like this. Someone dies and has no family that is eligible for benefits under SSI except the death benefit. Someone contacts the family about SSI posing as a person from SSA and has them fill out the forms for the death benefit. They pay the family the $255 death benefit. Since the SSA doesn't know that the person is dead they(the criminals) can sell the persons identity to someone else. All they have to do is get a birth certificate which the family has already provided in order to get their "SSI death benefit".<br>  NOTE: SSA=Social Security Administration & SSI=Social Security Insurance|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	If (and that's a big "if") this isn't a scam/fraud, what is being offered is highly illegal. It sounds like she is offering to produce fake documentation. Even if it came from the proper authorities, the false information and birth certificate would mean if your friend is caught they would not be eligible to enter the US again - ever, most likely, but 10 years at the minimum.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the country  your friend is from, they may be able to travel to the US on the Visa Waiver Program on a passport from their own country.

Think about it,the friends name will be changed and it will cost $10,000. If that isn't fraud,then nothing is. Highly illegal and anyone that is involved will be facing federal charges.
23bgwpD1aa	He promotes letting teenagers make the decision without the parents consent. I thought the parents were responsible for the kid.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	When did he 'promote' abortion? He didn't.

Get over it.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	I think its sickening. Obama is a sick man|`|TBvUomw7aa	I don't think that it matters whether or not the President is for it or against it.  They are never going to ban it in this country.  Bush acted as if he didn't appreciate the fact that people were allowed to get abortions in various states but nothing really *changed* there.  It is way too big of a hassle and there is not enough money to be made for the government to really tap into it besides giving their opinion.|`|SwyZkNn6aa	Nobody "promotes" abortion.  It's just important to have it as a safe, legal choice.<br>  <br>  What part of stem cell research gets you all worked up?  Again, it is NOT aborted fetuses for crying out loud.  They are frozen embryos that hopeful mothers create but end up not using.<br>  <br>  Yet nobody seems to be up in arms over IVF, which is why they exist in the first place!<br>  <br>  Jesus H.|`|f4K08k0Raa	Abortion is legalized murder doesnt matter how far along the woman is there would be a baby coming. Making it legal will just show the youth they can have sex and have as many babies as they want and the government will take care of it.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	glad he is for it.<br>  <br>  in this way I am very conservative.  I don't want to pay for all the unwanted children and poor mothers that would happen if abortion was banned.|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	I don't like it. I'm 100% against abortion, but if he abolished only 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions, then I could accept that.|`|eQ2kITWqaa	I don't like obama but he is right why force people to have children when they can't take care of themselves the only thing that should change is killing the people that have abortions.
